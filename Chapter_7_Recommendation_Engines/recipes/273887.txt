Ingredients:
2 large limes, zested and juiced
3  green onions, sliced
3 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
2 tablespoons salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Fiesta Lime)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Â¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6  skinless chicken thighs

Directions:
Mix lime zest, lime juice, green onions, olive oil, cilantro, seasoning blend, garlic, coriander, red pepper flakes, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag or a bowl with a lid. Pour the marinade over the chicken and cover evenly. Seal the bag or cover the bowl.
Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 4 to 6 hours.
Remove chicken from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Cook chicken on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is my go-to cilantro chicken recipe for the grill in the summer. The longer it marinates, the stronger the flavor.
