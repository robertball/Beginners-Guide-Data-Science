Ingredients:
1 - 5 lb. chicken (either roaster cut up or just use boneless skinless breast)
4 T. olive oil
1 cup chopped onions
1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
2 - large green peppers julienned
1 - bulb garlic (minced)
2 - 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes
1 small can of tomato paste
1 tsp. oregano
1 tsp. basil
1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1 tsp. black pepper
1 cup red wine (I use Louis Jadot)
Parmesan to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â°. Wash and drain your chicken pieces. Heat oil in a large, deep skillet and brown each piece until it turns golden on both sides. Put browned chicken in a roaster pan.
Saute the garlic, green peppers, mushroom, and onion in the same pan that chicken was browned in for 10 min. Stir in the tomatoes (breaking by hand), tomato paste, wine, oregano and basil, salt and pepper. Cook for 10 min. and then add to the chicken in your roasting pan. Cover. Cook for 1 hour. When done, sprinkle with parmesan and serve. Enjoy!
