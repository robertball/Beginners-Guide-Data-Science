Description: 
There was a time when being called a shoemaker was the ultimate kitchen insult. It meant that your cooking skills were so weak, the cobbler down the street could have come into the kitchen and done just as well. This beautiful peach cobbler recipe is so easy, any shoemaker could master it.
