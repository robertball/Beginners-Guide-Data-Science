Ingredients:
6 turkey legs
1/2 gallon distilled or spring water
4 lbs. ice
1 cup kosher salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 TBS onion powder
1 TBS garlic powder
1/2 TBS smoked paprika (not hot paprika)
1 tsp freshly black pepper (coarsely ground)
1 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp sage (ground)
Hickory wood chunks

Directions:
Place the 1/2 gallon of water into a non-reactive pot. Add salt, sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, cumin, and sage.
Bring mixture to a simmer, and break up any spice clumps. Simmer for 5 minutes, the remove from heat, add ice, and stir until completely melted. This will yield 1 gallon of brine. Place into a vessel and place into a refrigerator until around 35-42F
Place brine in a 2 gallon freezer bag, as well as the legs. Place into a large pan (in case of leaks), and put back in the refrigerator for 8 hours.
Remove legs from brine, pat dry, If you still have 6 hours of free time, continue as stated. If not, place back in the refrigerator for the next day.
Heat smoker to 225F using hickory wood chunks. Smoke turkey legs for 6 hours, flipping them every 2 hours. Remove from smoker, let rest 5 minutes, then enjoy!
