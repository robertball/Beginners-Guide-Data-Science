1 cup herb-seasoned stuffing mix, crushed
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika

In a shallow bowl, beat egg, add orange juice. In another bowl, combine stuffing mix, paprika, orange peel and salt. Dip chicken in to the egg mixture, then into crumbs, turning to coat well. Pour butter into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Place chicken in baking dish, turning once to butter both sides. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes or until the chicken is tender and juices run clear. Garnish with orange slices if desired.

Description: 
I found this recipe several years ago while looking for a new way to prepare chicken. My husband, daughter and I live on a small farm in the mountains of north Georgia. This has become our favorite evening meal dish.
