Ingredients:
8 ounces fettuccini pasta
2 cups fresh broccoli florets
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups skim milk
⅔ cup part-skim ricotta cheese
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Gradually add milk, stirring with a whisk until blended.  Cook 15 minutes or until thick, stirring constantly.  Stir in ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.  Cook 5 minutes or until cheese melts.  Stir in steamed broccoli and cooked pasta.  Sprinkle with parsley.

Description: 
A low-fat alternative to a traditional Alfredo sauce.  I add chicken, most of the time, to make it a complete meal!
