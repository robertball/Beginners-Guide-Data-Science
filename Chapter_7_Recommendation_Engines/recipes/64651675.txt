Ingredients:
7 white large eggs, room temperature
1/4 cup chopped yellow onion
1 cup cooked chicken, chopped
1/4 cup blue cheese, chopped
1/4 cup buffalo wing sauce, Franks
1 celery stalk, chopped
1/4 cup blue cheese dressing, recipe below
Ingredients for blue cheese dressing
1/2 cup blue cheese
1 cup cream

Directions:
To boil your eggs. Take a large sauce pan and add eggs. Fill water to cover eggs and bring to a boil. Once boiling remove from heat, cover and set time for 12 minutes. When timer goes off remove from water using a slotted spoon and let cool.
Take onions and put in a glass microwave safe bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of water and microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds.  Let cool.  (you can saute but this is much quicker)
In your mini chopper add blue cheese and cream then blend.  Take out 1/4 cup and store the rest in a covered container for dressing or dipping vegetables.
In a large mixing bowl combine chicken, onion, blue cheese and dressing. Taste of any additional wing sauce.
Peel the eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Drop the yolks out into the large mixing bowl and combine into the mixture.
Mix all ingredients together. Put mixture into a sealable bag. Squeeze the mixture to one corner of the bag and snip off the corner of the bag. Use this to pipe the mixture into the eggs.

Description: 
This is such a great tailgating or just watching football at home! I like to make extra buffalo chicken and dip with celery and carrots. You can make this a paleo recipe by omitting the blue cheese! Enjoy..
