Ingredients:
4 matzo crackers, crushed
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/3 cup applesauce
3 Granny Smith apples - cored, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the crumbled matzos in a medium bowl, and add enough water to cover. Let stand for 2 minutes, then drain off excess water. Do not squeeze.
To the bowl of matzo, add eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, lemon juice and applesauce. Stir to combine. Mix in the apples and dried cranberries. Spread the mixture evenly into a 2 quart casserole dish. Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, and cinnamon; sprinkle over the top.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden, and the apples are soft.
