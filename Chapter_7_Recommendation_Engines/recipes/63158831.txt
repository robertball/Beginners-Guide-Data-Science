Ingredients:
1 (approx. 4 lb) pork shoulder butt roast
¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
¾ cup brown sugar
1¼ cups unsweetened apple juice
1 onion, sliced into rings
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place the roast in a 6 quart slow cooker and rub in the Worcestershire sauce on all sides.
Cover and let marinate at room temperature for 1½ hours.
After marinating place the rings of onion underneath the meat in the bottom of the pot.
Carefully rub in the brown sugar on all sides so that it adheres to the meat.
Pour 1¼ cup of apple juice carefully down the sides of the pot to the bottom so that it does not rinse the brown sugar off of the meat.
Turn the slow cooker on and cook for 8-10 hours on low or 4-5 hours on high (or until the meat easily separates with a fork).  The actual cook time will vary depending on the size of the roast.
Remove the meat to a cutting board then de-bone and slice it.  While the meat is out of the pot add the salt and black pepper to the juice and stir until it is mixed in.  Return the sliced meat to the slow cooker.
Let the meat soak in the juices for a minute or two before serving.
