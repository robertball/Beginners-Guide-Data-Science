Ingredients:
15 whole mild canned peppers (1 can)
2.5 pounds sausage
1 (16 ounce) package Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) package finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 cup mayonnaise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.
In a medium bowl, mix the Neufchatel and cheddar cheeses with the mayonnaise and onion powder until well mixed.
Trim the stem from each jalapeno pepper and halve the peppers across the middle, not lengthwise.
In a medium bowl, mix sausage, Cheddar cheese and garlic salt.
Stuff halved jalapenos with the cheese mixture. Shape sausage mixture around the jalapenos to form balls.  The sausage will shrink as it cooks, so be sure to use enough to cover each pepper.
Arrange jalapeno balls on the prepared baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
