Ingredients:
5 cups sliced fresh peaches
1/2 cup packed brown sugar, divided
2 tablespoons instant tapioca
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 3/4 cups flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/3 cup walnuts or pecans
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine peaches, 1/4 cup brown sugar, tapioca and almond extract in large bowl; set aside for 15 minutes.
Combine flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar in medium bowl.  In a food processor, chop oats and walnuts for 10 to 15 seconds, or until coarse crumbs form;  add to flour mixture.
Drizzle melted and cooled butter over flour mixture. Use a fork to gently toss and create crumbs.
Transfer peaches into 8 x 8 inch baking pan. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over top. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until topping is golden brown and peaches are bubbling.  Serve slightly warm.

Description: 
I love fruit crisps.  I created this recipe after picking a half-bushel of peaches with my family at a local orchard.  The topping can be used on various other fruits as well.  I served this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!
