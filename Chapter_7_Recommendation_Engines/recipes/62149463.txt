Ingredients:
1 large pork roast (butt roast is best)
10-15 dry red chilies (Adjust for heat preference)
2 tablespoons chicken base
2 cloves garlic, crushed
4 tablespoons cumin
2 tablespoons onion powder
3 15.5 ounce cans white hominy
salt & pepper to taste
chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Cook pork roast to your liking either in slow cooker or in oven (My family usually has pork roast one night, then I uses the leftover pork for the soup).
Shred the pork, and save 2 cups of the pork stock, set aside.
Boil 4-5 cups of water, to soften red chilies.
Pulled stems off red chilies and rinse out seeds, and place chilies in a blender.
Pour 4-5 cups of boiling water to blender and let sit for 15 minutes or until chilies are soft.
While chilies are soaking, add shredded pork with stock to a large pot and add water to cover.
Pour 1/2 of water out of blender and puree.
Add pureed chilies to pot, bring to boil.
Add remaining ingredients except cilantro to the pot, and simmer for 1 hour.
Add soup to bowls and top with chopped cilantro.

Description: 
This is a mexican soup similar to menudo, but made with pork instead of intestine. So tasty that others have begged me for the recipe! Great for a cold day, special occasion or even a hangover. The great thing about this recipe is it can be tweaked to match your taste buds.
