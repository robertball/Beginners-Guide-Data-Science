Ingredients:
1/2 pound spaghetti noodles
1 tsp. oil
1 onion, chopped
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
1 zucchini, halved horizontally,
thinly sliced
1 carrot, chopped
soy sauce
1 Tbsp. vegetable-flavored
bouillon granules
1 tsp. garlic powder

Directions:
Prepare pasta according to package directions; drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, in large skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook until tender-8 to 10 minutes. Add broccoli, zucchini, and carrot. Cook until crisp-tender, adding 2 to 3 Tbsp. water if needed to prevent sticking. Add pasta, soy sauce, vegetable bouillon, garlic powder, and 3/4 cup of water.
Bring to a boil; cook 5 minutes.
