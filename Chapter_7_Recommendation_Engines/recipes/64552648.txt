Ingredients:
3/4 cups sugar
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons almond extract
1/2 cup pineapple-orange juice concentrate, defrosted
1/2 cup limeade concentrate, defrosted
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup dark rum
1/4 cup light rum
4 maraschino cherries, stemmed and halved
8 pineapple tidbits

Directions:
Make Almond Simple Syrup: Heat sugar and 1/2 cup water on low and stir occasionally until all sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and add almond extract. Alternatively, you may use ToraniÂ® Almond Orgeat Syrup.
Pour concentrates into large bowl, than mix in water. Add 4 tablespoons of the almond syrup and the rums, and mix to combine.
Put one cherry half and a pineapple tidbit in the bottom of each popsicle mold. Pour in cocktail mixture and freeze for 12 hours or overnight (boozy pops take longer to freeze than regular pops).  Makes 8 (3-ounce) pops.
