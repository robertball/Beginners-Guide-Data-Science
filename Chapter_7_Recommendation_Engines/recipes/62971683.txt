Ingredients:
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 tbs fresh lime juice
5 garlic cloves
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1 tbs canola oil
1 whole chicken quartered
OR
2-3 lbs chicken breasts

Directions:
Whisk all ingredients (except chicken) in a large bowl.  Once well blended put the chicken in a large zip lock bag and add the marinade.  Seal the bag and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 8-24 hours.  Grill the chicken until cooked thoroughly.  I typically grill mine on a George Foreman grill for about 11 minutes per chicken breast.

Description: 
I got this recipe from Epicurious.  It is listed as coming from Gourmet; however, I have made a few slight changes so this is my adaption of the recipe.  It makes a nice grilled chicken with great flavor that could be paired with a variety of side dishes.
