Description: 
This recipe supposedly earned its name because it is SO addictive and I agree! I absolutely love this stuff. You can just eat it with a fork or make lettuce wraps out of the mix. Simple and DELICIOUS! I say 4 servings here but really, my wife and I could polish off the batch with no problem!
