Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
6 eggs, lightly beaten
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tsp. cinnamon
4 T. sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
Dash of freshly grated nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Melt butter in a 9 x 12 baking dish.
In a medium bowl, mix flour and other ingredients. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
Bake on center rack in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Dust with powdered sugar and serve with syrup,jam, or jelly, or cook your favorite fruit (apples, blueberries, etc.) with butter, cinnamon and sugar and top the pancake with this. Another reviewer suggested this buttermilk syrup: mix 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup butter, 2 TBSP corn syrup and 1 tsp baking soda. Bring to a boil, cook for seven minutes, then stir in 2 tsps vanilla.
