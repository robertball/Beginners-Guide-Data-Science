Ingredients:
2 cups shredded zucchini
1/3 cup boiling water
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup sunflower seeds
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 cup and a 6 cup muffin pan.
In a large bowl, stir together zucchini and boiling water.
In a separate bowl, mix flour, sugar, sunflower seeds, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, and nutmeg.
Blend eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract with the zucchini. Stir the zucchini mixture into the flour mixture. Spoon into the prepared muffin pans.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

These muffins are versatile and always moist and delicious. People are surprised to learn that there is zucchini in them. We served them often at Mossberry B&B on Ponderosa Drive.
