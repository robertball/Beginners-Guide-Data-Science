Ingredients:
5 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts
1 egg whisked with 1 tbsp water (this is an “egg wash”)
1 cup slivered almonds
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon each grated lemon and lime peel
½ teaspoons salt
¼ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
½ cup all purpose flour
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Lemon Cream Sauce:
4 tablespoons butter
1 bunch green onions thinly sliced
6 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 cup whipping cream
1 dash of salt
1 dash of pepper

Directions:
Mix almonds, thyme, lime and lemon peels
Chop until well mixed
Add ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper and place the mixture on a plate. Place the flour on a second plate
Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper
Dredge both sides of the chicken breasts in flour
Dip only one side of the chicken in the prepared egg wash and press the same side in the almond mixture, pressing lightly to adhere
Repeat with the remaining chicken. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat
Add the chicken, almond crusted side first, to the hot oil and cook until crust is brown, about 4 minutes
Turn chicken over and sauté another 4-5 minutes until cooked through. Transfer chicken to plates and spoon sauce around chicken and serve
Lemon Cream Sauce:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium high heat
Add green onions and sauté 2 minutes. After 2 minutes lower heat and cook until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes
Add 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice and gently simmer until most of the liquid evaporates
Mix in the cream and simmer for 2 minutes
Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth
Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Serve over chicken bundles
