Description: 
Go figure – everyone is being good and posting healthy meals since it is the beginning of the year, and here I am tempting you with a very unhealthy dish! You may be wondering if the title was a typo. But it's not! This side dish gets it's name because it is a popular dish for luncheons after funerals. But don't worry, you can eat this creamy, cheesy side dish anytime – not just following a funeral, thank goodness.
