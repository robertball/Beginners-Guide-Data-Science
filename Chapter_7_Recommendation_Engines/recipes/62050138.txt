Ingredients:
4-5 Tb vegetable oil
12 corn tortillas
2 chicken breasts, cooked & shredded
1/2 small can chopped green chilies
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (28oz) can green enchilada sauce
1/4 tsp cumin
salt & pepper to taste
1/2 C sour cream
4 oz Mexican blend shredded cheese

Directions:
Heat 1T oil in pan, and sauté onions until translucent.  Add the shredded chicken, green chilies, cumin, salt & pepper, and add a ½ cup of the enchilada sauce.  Mix well and cook for 1-2 min. In another small skillet, heat remaining oil and quickly fry each tortilla for 15 seconds, flipping it over after 7-8 seconds.  Drain tortillas on paper towels.  Pour enough enchilada sauce in a 9 x 13 baking dish to thinly cover the bottom. Spoon filling onto tortillas and roll.  Place seam side down into prepared dish.  Pour enough sauce to completely cover enchiladas, reserving a ½ cup.  Mix sour cream into remaining sauce & pour over middle section.  Top with cheese.  Bake at 350° for 20-30 minutes.

Description: 
Mild green chili and chicken enchiladas are covered in a sour cream sauce and topped with cheese. This easy recipe is always a hit with guests.  The filling is also excellent in quesadillas. (To lighten up on calories, microwave the tortillas in the package with a few drops of water to soften them instead of frying.)
