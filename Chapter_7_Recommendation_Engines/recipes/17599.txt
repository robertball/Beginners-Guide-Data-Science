Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package strawberry cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package flavored Jell-OÂ®
4 cups water
2 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed
2 cups strawberries, sliced

Directions:
Prepare cake according to package directions. Bake as directed for a 9x13 inch pan. Allow to cool.
Prepare the strawberry gelatin according to package instructions, using the 4 cups of water. Pour over cooled cake while still in liquid form; the cake will absorb it. Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until gelatin is set.
Spread whipped topping over cake and top with sliced strawberries.

Description: 
An incredibly moist and light cake made with cake mix, strawberry gelatin and fresh strawberries. Great for summer picnics and get-togethers. Can be made to be very low fat by using an egg substitute and applesauce instead of oil in the cake mix and using fat free topping.
