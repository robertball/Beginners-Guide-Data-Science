Ingredients:
2 pheasants, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into pieces
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour for dredging
1/4 cup butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth
1 1/4 cups water

Directions:
Season pheasant with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour, and shake off excess.
Melt butter in a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear pheasant pieces until well browned. Stir in garlic, and cook for a few seconds until fragrant. Pour in lemon juice, beef broth, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the pheasant is tender, about 1 hour.
