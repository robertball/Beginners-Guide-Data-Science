1/4 + 3/4 jar salsa verde
1/2  + 1/2 onion, diced
1/2 + 1/2 poblano pepper (or whatever you have), diced
1 clove garlic (or more, I also added 1 tsp garlic powder)

2 tsp trader joe chili lime seasoning
Large can (7oz) diced green chilis
1 can cannelloni beans
1/4c cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Saute  half the onion & pepper for a few minutes, add garlic.
Deglaze the pan with a small amount of water.
Add 1/4 jar of salsa verde and the chicken breasts. Add 1/2 the seasoning.
Cook on medium-low (crockpot high) until chicken is done (I used Foodie, slow cook mode Hi, about 3.5 hours).
Remove chicken and shred, add back to pot with remaining onions, peppers, seasonings and salsa. Add beans, chilis, and cilantro.
Cook medium to medium hi 1 hour
Add corn (frozen) and sour cream and bring to temperature.
Serve with additional cilantro, shredded cheese & tortilla chips.
