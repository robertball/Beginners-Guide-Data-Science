Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup avocado oil
3 mashed bananas
1/4 cup raisins, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Pour in milk, olive oil, and avocado oil. Add mashed bananas and raisins and stir to combine. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Let bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
