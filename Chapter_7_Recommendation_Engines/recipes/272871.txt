Description: 
This is a delicious, rich, dessert-like mini pancake recipe that I came up with. My whole family loves them! Can be topped with syrup, whipped topping, or both. We use the minimal amount of syrup due to the richness of the pancakes. Occasionally, my children like a couple of these with a scoop of vanilla ice cream as a treat.
