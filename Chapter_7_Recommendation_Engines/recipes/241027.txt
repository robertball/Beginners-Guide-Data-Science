Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup molasses
3/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk flour, ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat butter in a large bowl until creamy. Gradually beat in 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in molasses. Stir 1/2 of the flour mixture into butter mixture; add remaining flour mixture and stir until dough is just-combined.
Pour 3/4 sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 2 inch balls and roll each ball in sugar to coat. Place sugar-coated dough balls 2 1/2-inches apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are light brown and puffed, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
