Description: 
If you don't want to make crostini (little toasts), a low-fat cracker will work just fine. And while this dip is best with Asiago (ah-SY-AH-go)--a firm Italian cheese with a rich, nutty flavor--you can substitute other firm, full-flavored cheeses such as Parmesan or Romano, if desired.
