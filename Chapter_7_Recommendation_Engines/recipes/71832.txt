Ingredients:
Couscous (look for Israeli or whole-wheat)
1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
1 small stalk celery, finely chopped
1/2 cup couscous
3/4 cup water
Spicy Yogurt Dressing:
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons fat-free plain yogurt
1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
Pinch freshly ground black pepper
Salad
1/4 cup dried currants or raisins
1/4 cup canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley
1/4 cup sliced medium scallions
1/2 lemon, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
To make the couscous: Heat the oil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the couscous, coating with oil. Cook and stir for 1 minute until lightly toasted. Add the water and bring to a boil, stirring gently. Remove from the heat. Let stand, covered, for 30 minutes until cool and the liquid is absorbed, uncovering occasionally to fluff with a fork.
To make the spicy yogurt dressing: In a large bowl, mix together the lemon juice, yogurt, oil, ginger root, garlic, cumin, coriander, and pepper. Whisk before serving.
To make the salad: Transfer the couscous to a large serving bowl. Spoon the currants or raisins, chickpeas, bell peppers, cilantro or parsley, and scallions into separate mounds around the couscous. Add the dressing. Toss all the ingredients together at the table. Garnish with the lemon wedges, if using.
