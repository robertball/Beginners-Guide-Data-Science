1/2 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, diced
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef, onion, soy sauce and garlic until beef is brown and juices run clear.
While beef is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Return cooked pasta to its pot over low heat; stir in milk and butter.  Stir in beef mixture until well combined.  Stir in cheese slices, one at a time, until melted.  Serve at once.
