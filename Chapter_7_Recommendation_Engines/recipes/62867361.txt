Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 Tablespoons Onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped lemon grass
1 Tablespoon Red Curry Paste
2 1/8 cups chicken stock
2 cups canned pumpkin
1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut milk
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, butter over low heat. Cook garlic, onion, and lemongrass in oil until fragrant (be careful not to burn the garlic).  Add 1 cup of chicken stock, and stir. Pour mixture into blender, and blend until smooth. Strain with cheesecloth, to remove lemongrass strings. Return liquid to pot. Stir in red curry paste, coconut milk, and pumpkin; bring to a boil.
In a blender, blend 2 cups of the soup, with the basil leaves. Return to pot and stir.  Serve with additional basil leaves as garnish, if desired.
