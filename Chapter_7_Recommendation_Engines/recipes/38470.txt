Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Melt butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Cook and stir  onion, garlic, and mushrooms in butter until tender. Reduce heat, and slowly stir in cream. Continue cooking until sauce has thickened, add ham and basil, and simmer for 10 more minutes.

Description: 
This is one of our favorite pasta dishes. I use honey ham from the deli and it really gives the dish good flavor. For reheating leftovers, add a little extra cream and simmer over medium low heat on stove.
