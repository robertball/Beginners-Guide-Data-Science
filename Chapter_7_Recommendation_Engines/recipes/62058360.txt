Ingredients:
-4 chicken thighs, with skin and bone, excess fat trimmed and discarded
-1/2 cup lime juice
-1/2 cup melted margarine
-3/4 cup flour
-1 tsp salt
-1/2 tsp pepper
-4 generous Tbs brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Toss the chicken and lime juice together in a large bowl. Pour the melted margarine into an 8x8 inch baking dish. In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Place each piece of chicken into the flour, tossing to coat. Lay into baking dish, first skin side down to coat it with the margarine, then flip the chicken over so the skin is now facing up for cooking. Top each piece with a thick coating of brown sugar, and bake uncovered for 45-50 min, being careful not to let the sugar crust get too dark towards the end. If it seems like it is, just cover loosely with foil.

Description: 
Home-style simplicity. I use this recipe for last minute company because I usually have it all on hand, anything will go well with it, and it usually goes over very well. Everyone I've served this to loves it. I reccomend allowing two pieces per person, and if time allows, marinate the chicken in the lime juice for a couple of hours.
