Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
2 tablespoons butter
2 onions, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 cups water
1 (28 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon dried sage
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 cup whole milk

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a separate bowl.
Melt butter in the same pot. Cook onions until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add water, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, sage, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.
Return the cooked sausage to the pot. Pour in milk and bring soup to a gentle simmer. Taste and adjust salt as needed.

Description: 
I wanted a simple pumpkin soup that used ingredients I had on hand - nothing weird that I'd have to shop for. This hits the spot! I started from another recipe and modified to fit my pantry and favorite flavors, like sage!
