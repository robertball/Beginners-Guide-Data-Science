1/4 Teaspoons Pepper

To clarify the stock
Strain stock by ladling it through a fine screen, or with colander lined with 1 or 2 layers of 100-percent-cotton cheesecloth.
Separate an egg (discard the yolk or save for another use). In a small bowl, combine the egg white and 1/4 cup cold water.
Stir the mixture into the hot, strained stock. Bring to boiling. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. (As the egg white cooks, it will coagulate and trap fine particles from the stock).
Line a large colander several layers of damp 100-percent-cotton cheesecloth over a large bowl. Pour the stock through the cloth to strain out the particles and egg white.
