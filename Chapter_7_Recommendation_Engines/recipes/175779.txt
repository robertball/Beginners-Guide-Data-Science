Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon minced onion
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the eggs into a food processor, and process until light and frothy. Add Cheddar cheese, onion, and jalapeno peppers, and process until smooth. Pour into an ungreased 8x8 inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; cut into squares to serve.

Description: 
This is a wonderful baked appetizer blending the tastes of Cheddar cheese and jalapeno peppers. The amount of jalapenos used can easily be adjusted to personal taste, although baking does take a lot of the burn out of the peppers. I've made this several times and I never have leftovers.  My husband wishes I would make these for him every day.  I don't recommend doubling the recipe; make multiple batches instead.
