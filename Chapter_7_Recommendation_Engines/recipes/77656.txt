Description: 
So this is my favorite Italian dish.  I would take this any time over anything with red sauce.  I could get this whenever I wanted when I lived in NJ, but now that I'm in PA, it's not so easy.  So this is what I came up with as a replacement.  I'm not sure how authentic it is, but it's good!
