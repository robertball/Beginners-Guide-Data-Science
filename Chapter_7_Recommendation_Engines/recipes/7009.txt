Ingredients:
1/3 cup shortening
1 cup hot water
1 cup packed brown sugar
3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
4 tablespoons white sugar
4 teaspoons salt
6 cups bread flour
6 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
Dissolve brown sugar in 1 cup hot water.  Add shortening, and stir to melt.  Let cool.
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 4 cups warm water.  Add white sugar, salt, and bread flour.  Beat well.  Stir in shortening mixture.  Stir in enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff but not dry dough.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and elastic.  Place in a large, well oiled bowl.  Cover, and allow to rise until dough doubles in bulk.
Divide dough into four equal parts.  Shape into loaves.  Place in greased, 9 x 5 inch pans,  turning each loaf over in pan to grease top.  Allow to rise until dough doubles in bulk.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Let cool before slicing.
