Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon Lapsang Souchong Tea
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup Tamari Soy sauce or regular soy sauce
3/4 cup Pineapple or Orange Juice
1/2 cup Cooking oil
2 cloves garlic finely chopped or pressed
1 1/2" piece of ginger root peeled and chopped or pressed
1 Tablespoon Honey
1 Tablespoon Dark Brown Sugar or Demerara Raw Sugar
2 Tablespoons Sherry

Directions:
Heat Water and brew tea for 3 minutes. You just want a touch of the Smoky flavor of the tea. Allow to cool while you prepare other ingredients.
Mix all ingredients in a jar and shake.          Pour over meat.
Marinate for 4 hours turning once.
This is a recipe I have been making for many years.
I don't always add the sherry but I use it when I have it.

Description: 
This is a teriyaki style marinade. This works well with beef, chicken, pork and portabello mushrooms. I like to use sirloin tips or a flank steak sliced on the bias and cooked medium rare.
