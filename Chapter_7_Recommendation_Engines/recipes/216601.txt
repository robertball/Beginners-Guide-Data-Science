Ingredients:
1/2 (250 g) package Philadelphia Brick Cream Cheese, softened
1 (300 g) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, well drained
1 1/4 cups KRAFT Mozzarella Shredded Cheese, divided
6 tablespoons KRAFT 100% Parmesan Grated Cheese, divided
6 (4 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness
1 egg
10 RITZ Crackers, crushed
1 1/2 cups pasta sauce

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Mix cream cheese, spinach, 1 cup mozzarella and 3 Tbsp. Parmesan until well blended; spread onto chicken breasts. Starting at 1 short end of each breast, roll up chicken tightly. Secure with wooden toothpicks, if desired.
Beat egg in pie plate. Mix remaining Parmesan and cracker crumbs in separate pie plate. Dip chicken, 1 at a time, in egg, then roll in crumb mixture. Place, seam-sides down, in 13x9-inch baking dish sprayed with cooking spray.
Bake 30 min. or until chicken is done (170 degrees F), heating pasta sauce near the end of the chicken baking time. Discard toothpicks. Serve chicken topped with pasta sauce and remaining mozzarella.
