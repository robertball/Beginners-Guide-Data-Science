Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 stick butter, softened.
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or artificial flavoring)
1/2 pound strawberries, finely diced.
3 large eggs
For the glaze:
1 cup confectioners sugar
1/4 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon strawberry extract
1-2 drops red food coloring, if desired

Directions:
With an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
In a separate bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Slowly beat into the egg mixture until just combined. Fold in the strawberries.
Pour into a loaf pan, and bake at 350 for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
For the glaze:
Whisk together confectioner's sugar, buttermilk, strawberry extract and vanilla. If a thicker glaze is desired, add more sugar.
Allow bread to cool slightly, then remove from the pan. Pour glaze over the top. Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream, if you want to make it even better.
