Ingredients:
3  skinless boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup ranch dressing
8 ounces shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
Â½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 cups shredded lettuce, or to taste
1  tomato, diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add chicken breasts to water and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool chicken and shred with a fork.
Stir ranch dressing, Mexican cheese blend, cream cheese, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl with a fork until well-combined; add chicken and stir. Spread chicken mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature; top with lettuce and tomato.
