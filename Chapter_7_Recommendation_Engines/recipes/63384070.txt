Directions:
Fill a large pan with water with tbsp salt and tbsp olive oil, place over high heat, and bring to a boil;
Add the spaghetti, and stir until all the strands are submerged; Cook for some 10 minutes or so until al dente
Put the olive oil, butter, and garlic in a frying pan and cook gently until garlic begins to sizzle;
Add the pancetta and cook on a slightly higher heat, 2 to 3 minutes until the pancetta and garlic begin to brown, but not crisp;
Add the wine and cook until it has reduced by half;
Remove from the heat and set aside;
While the pasta is cooking, put the parsley and the grated cheeses in a serving bowl large enough to serve the pasta in;
Add the eggs, cream (if using) and season lightly with salt and generously with pepper;
Combine together thoroughly;
When the pasta is almost ready, put the pan with the pancetta back over medium-high heat;
When ready, drain the pasta and pour into the serving bowl tossing vigorously until it is well coated with the egg mixture;
Pour the contents of the frying pan into the bowl, toss again, and serve immediately;
Great with crusty bread
