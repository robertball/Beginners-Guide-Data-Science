Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen
1/2 cup sour cream
1 large egg
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 to 1 tablespoon of orange zest

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400 degrees. Mix flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in food processor with metal mixing blade. Cut butter into flour mixture by tablespoons; pulse to cut in butter until dough begins to form (mixture should resemble coarse meal)
In a small bowl, whisk sour cream and egg until smooth.
Pulse to stir sour cream mixture and orange zest into flour mixture until large dough clumps form. Add craisins at the end and pulse one more time. (The dough will be sticky in places, and there may not seem to be enough liquid at first, but as you pulse, the dough will come together.)
Dump on a lightly floured surface and work dough into a ball, incorporating all the flour from food processor. Dough should remain coarse, don't "over knead" pat into a 7- to 8-inch circle about 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with 1 tsp. of sugar. Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 (or more, if you like smaller scones) triangles; place on a cookie sheet (preferably lined with parchment paper), about 1 inch apart. Bake until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes and serve warm or at room temperature.
