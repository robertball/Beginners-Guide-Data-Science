Ingredients:
6 cups elbow macaroni
2 cups mayonnaise, or more to taste
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup shredded carrot
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Combine the macaroni, mayonnaise, milk, and carrot in a large bowl; mix until macaroni is well coated. Add more mayonnaise for a wetter consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or up to overnight.

Simple and tasty macaroni salad just like you'd get at a Hawaiian restaurant. No fruit in this salad, just macaroni, carrot, and dressing. Very yummy and easy to make.
