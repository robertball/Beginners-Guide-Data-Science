Ingredients:
8 large chicken legs
1 tablespoon salt
1 cup honey
1 cup orange juice with pulp
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
7 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped
2 oranges, zested
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Sprinkle chicken with salt and place in a large glass or plastic bowl.
Whisk together honey, orange juice, butter, rosemary, orange zest, and garlic. Pour orange mixture over chicken; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken legs in a single layer in a roasting pan; pour orange mixture over chicken.
Roast for 30 minutes in the preheated oven; reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Baste chicken with pan juices every 20 minutes until chicken is a deep orange brown color, no longer pink at the bone, and  juices run clear, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This is always a hit when I make it for dinner parties and Boxing Day dinner because the chicken is always fall-off-the-bone juicy and people love the glaze. People always go for seconds! 

You may quarter 2 chickens instead if you aren't able to get just legs from your butcher, but I find the legs are juicier and save money. Serve this dish with fragrant rice and dilled carrots or roasted asparagus.
