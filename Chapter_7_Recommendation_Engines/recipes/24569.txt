Ingredients:
1 recipe Basic Crepes
6 slices bacon
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste
2/3 cup chicken broth
2 eggs
1/2 cup lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Prepare Basic Crepes recipe according to recipe directions. Separate with wax paper and keep warm until ready to serve.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Reserve about 1 tablespoon drippings, add 1 tablespoon butter, and saute mushrooms.
In a separate saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Whisk in 1/4 cup flour, stirring constantly, until a smooth paste is formed. Gradually stir in 1 cup milk, stirring constantly until a smooth thick gravy is formed. Add bacon, mushrooms, spinach, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Let cook until somewhat thick, about 10 minutes.
In saucepan bring broth to a boil.  In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and lemon juice. Temper eggs and broth together whisking constantly so as to cook, but not to scramble the eggs. (Cooking eggs to 170 degrees F).  Again, salt and pepper to taste.
Fill each crepe with spinach and meat filling, roll up, and top with warm egg sauce.
