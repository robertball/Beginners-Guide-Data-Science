1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, water and vanilla. Combine the oats, flour, orange peel, cinnamon and baking soda; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in the raisins (dough will be stiff).
Drop by level tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
Here's a slightly different twist on a traditional favorite. These crisp, chewy oatmeal cookies feature golden raisins and have a mild orange tang. They're a staple in my picnic basket! -Marion Lowery, Medford, Oregon
