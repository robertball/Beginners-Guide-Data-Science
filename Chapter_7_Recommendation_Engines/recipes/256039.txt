Ingredients:
2 large Anaheim chile peppers, stems removed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (optional)
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup butter
1 (8 ounce) package shredded pepper Jack cheese
1 (4 ounce) package grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 pinch salt and ground white pepper to taste
1 cup elbow macaroni
1/2 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®), crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place Anaheim peppers in a blender and blend, adding olive oil as needed to create a smooth paste.
Heat cream in a pot over medium heat; stir in butter. Add Anaheim pepper paste, pepper Jack cheese, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, Mexican cheese blend; cook, stirring constantly, until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Stir cheese sauce into elbow macaroni; transfer to a casserole dish and top with crushed crackers.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and cheese is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I made this recipe after seeing a spicy mac and cheese on TV. There was no recipe, so I just made one up. While it didn't seem very spicy to me, it came out delightfully creamy and gooey with just a hint of a kick.
