Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup salt
1 tablespoon jojoba oil
2 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
2 cups cold water
1 tsp vanilla extract
Food coloring

Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan, mix together the flour, salt, jojoba oil, cream of tartar, vanilla, and water.
2. Cook uncovered over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Stir constantly until the dough is the consistency of mashed potatoes.
3. Divide the dough into four equal portions.
4. Add approximately 6 to 8 drops of food coloring to each portion and knead the color into the dough to distribute it evenly. Kneading the color into the dough is the fun part -- kids will love it.
5. If you store the play dough in a plastic bag or airtight container, it will stay nice and soft and last for years.
