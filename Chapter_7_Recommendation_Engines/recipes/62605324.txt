Ingredients:
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
4 eggs
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup dark rum
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup water
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup dark rum

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.
In a large bowl, combine cake mix and pudding mix. Mix in the eggs, 1/2 cup water, oil,  1/2 cup rum, and nuts. Blend well. Pour batter into pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Let sit for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto serving plate. Brush glaze over top and sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze and repeat until all glaze is used.
To make the glaze:  in a saucepan, combine butter, 1/4 cup water and 1 cup sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat and continue to boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup rum.

Description: 
This recipe was originally submitted by Jackie Smith. I've modified it by added the nuts to the batter rather than sprinkling the pan with them. I also make this cake in a tube pan rather than a Bundt pan--I find it easier to clean.  This cake is delicious!Modified from: Golden Rum Cake
