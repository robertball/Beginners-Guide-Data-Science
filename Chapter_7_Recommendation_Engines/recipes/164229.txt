Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup butterscotch chips
1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Pour the butter into a 9x13 inch baking dish, then sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs on top, pressing down to form a crust. Sprinkle evenly with the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and shredded coconut. Drizzle the milk overtop, then sprinkle with the chopped walnuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until the condensed milk has thickened and turned brown, and the walnuts have browned, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack and cut into squares to serve.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my Mum has made as long as I can remember.  She is well known in the towns she's lived in in Canada for these squares.  Every wedding reception that was ever held in her church included a pan of these squares and they are the first item everyone goes for when dessert is served.  Rich and delectable!  I served them at my wedding on March 1st of 2008.
