Ingredients:
1 pound of dry beans.
2 tsp Kosher Salt.
Water.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250Â°.
Dump 1 pound of beans in a large Dutch oven (3 QT. or bigger, or some pot with a really tight-fitting lid (this will be more important in the next stage).  Add 2 tsp of Kosher salt. This recipe is about fun and ease: no Kosher salt?  Add any salt.  Add water.  The water should cover your beans by about 1-1,5 inch, just eyeball it. Bring beans to a boil, lid on.
Now, cover the pot tightly, set it in the oven and bake for 75 minutes. If you're using a regular pot, find a heavy lid.  (I once used an iron pan to cover my pot.)
Check beans in about 45 minutes. If they are tender, take them out of the oven. If not, put them back in the oven. If beans look too dry, add some boiling water.  Smaller beans will cook faster and vice versa. Check in 15 minutes. Beans should be done in 75 minutes.
By the way, 1 pound of dry beans is roughly equivalent to 3 15 oz. cans of beans - something like 5 cups.
Don't you love me already? ;-)

Description: 
Yes, I too was a non-believer. No soaking, no double-boiling -- delicious, tender beans, from chimp to champ, in just 90 minutes, start to finish. No comparison to canned beans and much tastier than those cooked using the conventional method.
