1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 teaspoons onion powder

1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
4 T-bone steaks (about 1 inch thick)

Directions:
1. In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well.
2. Add steaks and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Drain and discard marinade.
3. Grill steaks, uncovered, over medium heat for 5-7 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for rare, a meat thermometer should read 140°F; medium, 160°F; well-done, 170°F).
