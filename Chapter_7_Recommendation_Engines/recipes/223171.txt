Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground turkey
2 (10.75 ounce) cans tomato soup
1 1/4 cups water
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1/4 cup mango chutney
3 tablespoons curry powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup coconut milk, divided

Directions:
Break the ground turkey into small pieces into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the turkey, continuing to break it into smaller pieces, until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease as possible from the turkey.
Combine tomato soup, water, and minced garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add the turkey to the pot and return the mixture to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir chickpeas, red kidney beans, carrot, chutney, curry powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper through the turkey mixture; bring to a simmer, place a cover on the pot, and cook until the chickpeas are tender, about 15 minutes.
Stir 1/4 cup coconut milk through the chili, return cover to the pot, and simmer another 15 minutes. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup coconut milk into the chili, stir, and simmer 30 minutes more.

Description: 
The coconut, curry, and mango chutney really put the flavor in this one. I put this together one night with what I had, and loved the results. It tastes better the next day, just like most chili. This freezes well. Seriously, you have to try it.  Serve by itself, with rice, and/or with naan bread.
