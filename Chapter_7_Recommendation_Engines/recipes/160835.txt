Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large bowl; set aside.
Whisk together the garlic, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, half-and-half, an 1/2 cup olive oil in a bowl. Toss with the cooked spaghetti. Add the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, parsley, Jarlsberg, and pecans. Toss the salad again to mix, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
This salad gets better the longer sits. It's very addicting and takes a lot of self control to stop eating. Believe me I've seen it happen at many parties.
