Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen sweetened raspberries, thawed
2 medium ripe bananas, sliced
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
PANCAKES:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a blender, combine raspberries, bananas, pineapple and brown sugar; cover and process until blended. Transfer to a small saucepan; cook and stir over low heat until heated through. Set aside and keep warm. For pancakes, combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a greased hot griddle. Turn when bubbles form on top; cook until the second side is golden brown. Serve with warm fruit topping.

Description: 
Years of trying different pancake recipes hasn't changed my opinion that this classic one is best. A generous dollop of warm fruit on top makes the meal truly special.
