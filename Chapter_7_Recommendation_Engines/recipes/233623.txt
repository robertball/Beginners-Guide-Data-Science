Ingredients:
6 (8 ounce) fillets catfish
Greek seasoning, or to taste
4 ounces crumbled feta cheese
6 toothpicks
1 tablespoon dried mint
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season both sides of each catfish fillet with Greek seasoning. Sprinkle feta cheese and mint over one side of each fillet; drizzle olive oil over the cheese and mint. Beginning with narrower end, roll fish tightly around the filling and secure with a toothpick.
Cook on preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I enjoy grilling out all year, no matter what the weather. I came up with this recipe by experimenting because my wife would eat fish everyday for every meal if I would cook it. Our whole family likes the unique taste of this dish.
