Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening
2 teaspoons Mexican vanilla extract
1 orange, zested and juiced
2 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups dark chocolate chips (such as Hershey'sÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Very lightly grease a baking sheet.
Beat white sugar, brown sugar, butter, shortening, vanilla extract, and orange juice together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until creamy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.
Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and orange zest in another bowl. Stir into butter mixture. Fold in chocolate chips lightly. Chill dough in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown and still soft, but set in the middle, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
