Ingredients:
1 lb dried navy beans
1/2 large onion, finely chopped
1 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup chili sauce
2 tsp dry mustard
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/4 lb salt pork, scored 1/4" deep on the fat side of of the salt pork
1-1/2 cups boiling water
2 Tbsp tomato paste, if needed

Directions:
The day before, pick through the beans to make sure no dirt or small stones remain.  Place in a 4-qt. stockpot and cover with water, making sure water is at least 2" over top of beans.  Cover, and let soak overnight.  Drain in a colander.
Preheat oven to 300Â°F.
Place beans back into stockpot and mix in the onions.  In a separate bowl, mix together maple syrup, chili sauce, dry mustard, salt, and pepper.  Pour over beans and onions, place scored salt pork on top, and pour in boiling water.  Stir well, and cover.  Bake in preheated oven for 5-6 hours, stirring occasionally.  At this time, add some or all of the tomato paste if needed for thickening, stirring in well to blend.  Bake for another hour or so, until sauce is thickened.
