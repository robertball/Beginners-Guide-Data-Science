Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, chopped into small pieces
2 carrots, peeled and diced
1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2-3 ham hocks
1 can of Rotel tomatoes
1 package of fresh or dried black-eyed peas (if dried, you will need to soak and adjust cooking time)
1 bunch of collard greens, stemmed and chopped
cayenne pepper, about 1/2 tsp or to taste
salt and pepper
cooked white rice

Directions:
1.  Cook the bacon pieces in a large pot until the bacon is crispy; remove and reserve for garnish.
2.  Add the carrots, onion, and garlic and cook over medium low for a few minutes - just until they start to soften.
3.  Add the black-eyed peas, ham hocks, and Rotel and cover with water.  This will cook down quite a bit, so you should cover or almost cover the ham hocks.
4.  Bring to a boil, then turn down to simmer.  Let simmer for about an hour.
5.  Add the collard greens and seasonings.  Let simmer until the beans are tender.
6.  Remove the ham hocks.  Remove the usable meat from the hocks and return that to the pot.
7.  When ready to serve, add about 1/2 cup of rice to your bowl and top with the hoppin john.  Garnish with bacon and serve with tabasco sauce.
