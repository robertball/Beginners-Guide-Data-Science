Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon flax seed meal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 banana
1 cup coconut milk
1 egg

Directions:
Mix flour, flax seed meal, and baking powder together in a large bowl.
Mash banana in a separate bowl, add coconut milk and egg; stir. Pour banana mixture into flour mixture; mix batter to combine.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
