Ingredients:
1- 14.5 oz box of whole wheat pasta (you can use regular)(I like penne or elbows)
2 TBS butter
2 TBS flour
2 1/2 cups of milk (I use skim)
2 cloves of garlic- minced or grated
1/2 c. shredded or grated Parmesan Cheese
1/2 c. shredded Cheddar Cheese
1 c. shredded Mozzarella Cheese
1/4 c. shredded or grated Asiago Cheese
1 c. shredded Italian Cheese Blend
1 lb. of bacon- diced and cooked until crispy ( I use turkey bacon)
1-2 tsp each of salt and black pepper (according to taste)

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Boil pasta until tender, drain and put in a buttered casserole dish. Top with cooked bacon.
Melt butter and cook garlic for about 1 min. Add flour to make a roux. Add milk, salt and pepper and bring to a light bubble.
Remove from heat and add all but 1/2 cup of the Mozzarella and 1/2 cup of the Italian Blend.
Top the casserole with the remaining cheese and bake for 30-35 minutes until the cheese bubbles and browns.

Description: 
Rich baked Mac and Cheese with enough bacon to please meat eaters! I use an Italian Cheese blend, but also add additional Parmesan and Asiago for extra punch. I tend not to measure and go heavy on the pepper.

Enjoy!- Kathleen
