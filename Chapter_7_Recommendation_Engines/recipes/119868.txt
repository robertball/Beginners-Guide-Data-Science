Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons onion salt
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3 medium unpeeled baking potatoes

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. In another shallow bowl, combine the flour, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and seasonings. Cut each potato lengthwise into eight wedges. Dip potatoes into egg whites, then coat with crumb mixture. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spray wedges evenly with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
Looking for an alternative to french fries? Try these lightly crisp potato wedges. You can have fun with the coating--add some garlic powder, Cajun seasoning of whatever spices your family prefers.                                      --LaDonna Reed of Ponca City, Oklahoma
