Ingredients:
1-2lb pkg Frozen Hashbrown Potatoes w/onions and peppers
1 16oz pkg Tyson Precooked Grilled Chicken Strips, Cubed or chunked
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1-10 3/4oz can Campbell's Nacho Cheese Soup
1-16oz Low-fat Sour Cream
1 stick butter, cubed
2 cups Mexican Blend shredded Cheese
Topping:
2 cups crushed dry or plain Corn Flakes
1 tbsp butter
1 envelope Taco Seasoning Mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a large bowl, combine hashbrowns, chicken, green onions, soup, sour cream, butter and cheese. Blend well and thoroughly.
Place mix into a well greased 9x13 baking pan. Bake for 65-75 minutes.
In the mean time. Crush plain corn flakes (I prefer to use the bag it comes in, then measure out the amount I need for my dish and save the rest for another recipe.
In a small bowl melt butter then add crushed corn flakes and taco seasoning, mixing well with hands to incorperate the ingredients together.
Remove dish from oven, place cornflake mixture over the dish evenly and lightly press into the top of dish, return to oven and bake for another 15 minutes or until cornflakes are a dark golden color but not burnt.
Remove from oven and cool slightly before serving.
