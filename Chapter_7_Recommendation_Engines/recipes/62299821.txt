Ingredients:
1 batch pizza crust
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1/3 cup walnuts
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
pinch of salt
for the sauce:
1/3 cup blanched almonds
1/4 cup nutri yeast
1½ tablespoons bragg's aminos
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 cup spelt flower
1/2 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon tahini
1 cup unsweetened soy milk
3/4 tablespoon light miso
pinch black pepper and salt

Directions:
whatever crust you are using is ready, you will want to pre-bake it for about 5 minutes at 375°f. pull out and let cool for a few minutes. you can prep your sauce during this time - just put all the sauce ingredients in a food processor or magic bullet and blend until creamy.  you can also prep the topping sprinkle - use the walnuts, nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds and dash of salt. you can hand chop, but i just throw everything in the bullet and give it a few pulses.
once your crust has cooled, layer on creamy sauce and then the mushrooms.  in this recipe i used equal parts shiitake, black, straw and button because that's what i had. the shiitakes gave a bit of oriental flair, but use your favourite mushrooms.  i'm thinking one with portabellos, button and creminis would be nice. before you put your sprinkle on top, you'll want to bake about 8-10 minutes on 375°f to make sure the mushrooms are cooked well.  pull out and sprinkle on the topping, and bake for about 5-7 minutes more. pizza is one of those foods that tend to vary on cooking times (depending on the the amount of toppings and crust), so you'll just have to keep an eye on it and make sure the center is heated through.
