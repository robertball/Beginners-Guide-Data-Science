Description: 
Summer is right around the corner and with it, summer’s tempting, yet often very unhealthy, side dishes for the family picnic. But what if you could take a picnic classic and turn it into a deliciously healthy treat instead? This recipe from the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Lifestyle Medicine gives you super cancer-fighting cabbage, plus a splash of inflammation-reducing omega-3s. A 2008 study found that red cabbage consumption was linked to not only to cancer prevention but to brain and heart health as well! Enjoy some coleslaw this summer  without the guilt!
