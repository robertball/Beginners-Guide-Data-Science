Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skinless chicken thighs
1 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup pesto
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine chicken, potatoes, tomatoes, pesto, water, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large roasting pan; mix well.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
