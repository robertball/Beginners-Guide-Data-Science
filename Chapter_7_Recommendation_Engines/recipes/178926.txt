Ingredients:
3 prepared round ice cream sandwiches
1/2 cup chopped California Almonds, chopped finely
1 cup fresh strawberries, sliced
1/4 cup prepared chocolate sauce

Directions:
Allow ice cream sandwiches to soften slightly, about 3 minutes.
Place almonds in a shallow bowl and roll ice cream sandwiches in almonds, so almonds stick well to the sides.
Stack sandwiches onto a dinner plate. Top with any remaining almonds and scatter strawberries on bottom of plate and atop stacked ice cream sandwiches. Drizzle with chocolate sauce.

Submitter: 
Almond Board of California
Description: 
You can make this easy, yet impressive, dessert with round ice cream sandwiches as shown, or cut rectangle ice cream sandwiches in half and stack them tall.
