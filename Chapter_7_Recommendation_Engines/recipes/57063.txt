Ingredients:
1 ½ cups uncooked long grain white rice
3 cups water
2 pounds broccoli, chopped
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of celery soup
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup white wine
2 teaspoons curry powder
2 pounds salmon fillets, bones and skin removed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bring the rice and water to boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 25 minutes.
Arrange broccoli in the bottom of the baking dish. Mix the cream of celery soup, mayonnaise, wine, and curry in a bowl, and pour 1/2 evenly over the broccoli. Cut salmon into chunks and place in baking dish. Top with remaining soup mixture.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until broccoli is tender and fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve over cooked rice.

Description: 
This is an easy and delicious way to use either fresh or frozen salmon. Being from Alaska, our family puts up with a lot of salmon during the summer. This is a very good recipe to use in the middle of winter when your family is saying no more fish please!
