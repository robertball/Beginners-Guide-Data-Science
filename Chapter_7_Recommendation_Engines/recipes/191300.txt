Ingredients:
2 pounds baby "new" potatoes (with red skin)
1 cup DannonÂ® All Natural Plain Yogurt
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup black olives, pitted, sliced in half
1/4 cup capers, drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley

Directions:
In a 3-quart saucepan, cover potatoes with cold salted water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook, covered, until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting the tip of a sharp paring knife into a potato; it should fall off the knife easily. Remove from water with a slotted spoon and slice into quarters.
While potatoes are cooking, combine yogurt, mustard, lemon juice, oregano, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.
While potatoes are still warm, toss with vinaigrette. Add sliced onion, olives, and capers. Toss well to combine.
Top with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and serve.
