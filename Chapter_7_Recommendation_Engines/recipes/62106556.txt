Ingredients:
Pastry for a double crust pie (can use store bought)
1 cup cooked, cubed steak (bite size)
1 small potato, uncooked, peeled and diced
1 small carrot, uncooked, peeled and sliced thin
1 small onion, uncooked, chopped finely
1/4 cup gravy (can use pkg. gravy)
1 tbsp. steak sauce
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl, roll out six 7" pastry circles.  Brush half of each circle's edge with water. Divide the filling equally among the six pastries and bring the two side up above the filling and pinch edges together to close. The seam should be at the top. Brush with an egg wash or milk, if desired.  Place on greased cookie sheet and bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue cooking for 30 more minutes.  Serve hot.

Description: 
Delicious meat pies that your family will love.  It does take a little effort to cut up the vegetables and make the pie dough but you can save some time by using a pre-made pie crust, which can be found in the refrigerated section.  Also, if desired add your favorite, stringy cheese to the mixture.
