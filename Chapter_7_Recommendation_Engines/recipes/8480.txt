Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
3 cups white sugar
5 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch tube pan and line with parchment paper. Grease the parchment paper. Sift flour, salt and baking powder together and set aside.
In a large bowl, cream butter, shortening and 3 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Add 1 teaspoon rum extract and 1 teaspoon coconut extract. Add flour mixture alternately with milk and evaporated milk. Mix until smooth.
Pour batter into 10 inch tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Cool.
Make the glaze: in a saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon rum extract, 1 teaspoon coconut extract and 1 teaspoon almond extract. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Use a toothpick to pierce all over the top of the cake. Pour the glaze over the cooled cake and allow it to soak in.
