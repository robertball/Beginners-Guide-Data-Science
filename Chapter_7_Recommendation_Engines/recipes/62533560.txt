Ingredients:
4-5 pound cabbage
FILLING:
1/2 C. uncooked rice
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 C. milk
3/4 C. water
1/2 lb. ground chuck
1/2 lb. ground pork
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
3/4 C. milk
1/2 C. cabbage liquor
TO BAKE:
2 C. bouillon or water
1 TBS. flour
1/2 tsp. paprika
2 TBS. butter
1 TBS. brown sugar

Directions:
1. Bring first amount of milk and water to a boil.  Add salt and stir in rice.  Bring again to a boil, reduce heat and cook slowly until rice has absorbed all liquid, about 30 min.  Set aside.
2. Discard outside wilted leaves of cabbage.  Cut out core.  Put cabbage-core side down- in a large kettle of boiling salted water.  Remove leaves as they soften, and set aside.
3. Saute onions lightly.  Add onions and remaining ingredients to meat.  Add cooked rice, and mix thoroughly.
4. Trim thick center vein from cabbage.  Place 1/4 C. mix on each leaf.  Turn core end over meat, then sides; folding over to cover meat.  (2 or more small leaves can be combined.) (about 16 rolls)
5. Pour 1 to 1 1/2 C. stock or cabbage liquor over rolls.  Sprinkle tops lightly with flour and paprika.  Dot with butter.  Sprinkle brown sugar over all.  Bake in 375 oven until lightly browned, then reduce heat to 350 , basting occasionally for 45-60 min.

Description: 
Swedish recipe for Kaldomar. Even better reheated the next day. I have tried many cabbage rolls, never quite liked them until I used 1/2 beef, 1/2 pork. This one is my favorite, with it's sweet, mild flavor!
