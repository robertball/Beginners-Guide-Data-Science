Ingredients:
8 ounces spaghetti
1 (12 ounce) can corned beef
1 cup spaghetti sauce
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
1/2 tablespoon dried minced onion (optional)

Directions:
Dissolve bouillon in boiling water. Cut spaghetti noodles in half and add to boiling water until done.
Over medium heat empty can of corned beef onto a skillet. Add spaghetti sauce to meat. Stir until heated; corned beef will come apart and a thick sauce will form. If desired, add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, dry onion, or any other spices.
Once noodles are done, drain and combine with corned beef sauce.
