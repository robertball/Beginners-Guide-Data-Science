Description: 
I created this recipe on the fly because I didn't have my usual ingredients for spaghetti. I was so happy with how it tasted that I decided to make this my first recipe submission. This makes a very light sauce. If you prefer a heartier sauce, add 1/2 can of tomato paste or even use crushed tomatoes instead of whole, but I encourage you to try it as written; it's so yummy! Serve over al-dente spaghetti noodles. I hope you enjoy!
