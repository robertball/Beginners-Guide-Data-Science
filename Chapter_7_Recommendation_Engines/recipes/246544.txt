Ingredients:
6 cups chicken stock, divided
1 1/2 pounds asparagus, trimmed and chopped
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 ribs celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup half-and-half, or more to taste
1 pound processed American cheese (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring 4 cups chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan. Add asparagus and cook until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain asparagus, reserving the stock. Set a few asparagus tips aside for garnish.
Heat butter and olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes more.
Stir flour into onion mixture until combined, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups chicken stock; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Add cooked asparagus stalks and remaining reserved asparagus-chicken stock; bring soup to a boil.
Heat half-and-half in a small saucepan over medium heat until warmed slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add warmed half-and-half to soup, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to stockpot. Add American cheese and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Garnish with asparagus tips.
