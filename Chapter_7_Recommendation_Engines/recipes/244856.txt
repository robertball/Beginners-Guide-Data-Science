1 pound extra lean ground turkey
1/2 cup cooked black beans, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped tomato
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 egg white
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine turkey, black beans, onion, tomato, parsley, egg white, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined; form into 4 patties.
Heat a greased skillet over medium heat; cook patties until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
