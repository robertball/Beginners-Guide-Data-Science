Ingredients:
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1/2 pound Smithfield® Breakfast Sausage
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
12 eggs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco®)
Salt and pepper
Olive oil cooking spray
2 cloves garlic, chopped
3 tablespoons grated onion
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
A small handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped
Fresh basil leaves, torn

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Add a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over high heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up as it browns, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the chopped peppers and cook until soft, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and let cool.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs, Parmesan, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Add the cooked sausage and peppers. Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with olive oil cooking spray. Pour the egg mixture into the muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in another skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onion, and oregano and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and simmer to thicken, about 10 minutes.
Remove mini frittatas from the oven. Top each with a spoonful of the sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Reserve the remaining sauce for serving. Continue baking to melt the cheese, 5 minutes more. Top with parsley and basil.
