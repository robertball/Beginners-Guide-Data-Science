Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour/meal
1 teaspoon of sea salt
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chopped, dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1 large egg (room temp)
1 tablespoon of coconut oil
More coconut oil to grease cookie sheet and rolling pin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using coconut oil, grease baking sheet very liberally.
In a medium-sized bowl stir together almond flour, salt, garlic powder and dried rosemary.
In a separate, small bowl, whisk egg until frothy. Make sure your egg mix is room temp otherwise the oil will not mix. Add oil and mix. Pour egg-oil mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until the dough is well blended.
Make the crackers: Place dough on liberally greased baking sheet and, using your hands then greased rolling pin, flatten until the dough covers the sheet and is 1/16-1/8 inch thick. If your sheet pan is greased well enough it will not stick. Score with a butter knife to separate into crackers.
Bake for 10 minutes or so, until firm and lightly golden brown. Allow to cool before removing from baking sheet.
