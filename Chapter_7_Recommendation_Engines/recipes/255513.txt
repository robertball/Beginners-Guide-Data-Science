Description: 
This is a very easy recipe made with simple basics you usually have around the house. Perfect with after-dinner coffee or office pot-lucks. My sons also like to top it with whipped cream or ice cream. Change it up a bit by substituting a can of cherries or sliced peaches for a different variety of cobbler.
