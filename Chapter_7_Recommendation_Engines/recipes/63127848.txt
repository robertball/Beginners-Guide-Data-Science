Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup granulated white sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tbsp. vanilla extract
1/2 cup powdered confectioner's sugar
2 tbsp. evaporated milk
1 one-ounce square unsweetened baking chocolate, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Cut the granulated sugar and chili powder into the peanut butter. Stir in the egg and the vanilla. Drop by teaspoonfuls on cookie sheet, making little smooth mounds of batter. Using a plastic scraper/spatula, press long lines into the batter.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Combine the powdered sugar, milk, and melted chocolate; the consistency will be slightly runny, not stiff. Drizzle the chocolate mixture into the lines in the cooled cookies and continue to cool on the rack for another 10 minutes until the icing sets.
