Ingredients:
4 green bell peppers
salt to taste
1 pound ground turkey (93/7)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup chopped onion
pepper to taste
1/2 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/2 can diced mushrooms
1/3 cup baby carrots, diced
2 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning
1 cup cooked brown rice
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup reduced-fat shredded Cheddar cheese (2%)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup

Directions:
Cook the brown rice as directed and set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off  the peppers, remove the seeds, and slice them in half. Cook peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain.
In a large skillet, saute turkey, garlic, and onions for 5 minutes, or until turkey is browned. Season with pepper, basil, oregano, and italian seasoning. Stir in the tomatoes, carrots, mushrooms, rice, 1/4 cup water and Worcestershire sauce. Cover, and simmer for 5 minutes, or until rice is tender. Remove from heat.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (175 degrees C). Put approximately 1 tablespoon of cheese in the bottom of each pepper. Stuff each pepper with the beef and rice mixture, and place peppers open side up in a baking dish. Pour tomato soup over the peppers.
Bake covered for 15 minutes, until heated through and cheese is melted. Enjoy!
