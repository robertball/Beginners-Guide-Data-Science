Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
5 eggs
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan with some butter and dust lightly with flour.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in flour mixture alternately with milk. Mix in vanilla extract. Pour batter into the prepared tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is the recipe my Grandmother would make every year during the holidays. I found the recipe tucked in her Bible when she passed, and it was written in her Grandmother's handwriting. It's been in my family for at least 7 generations, and in 2012, I won a Blue Ribbon at the Kentucky State fair by following her exact instructions.

 Tastes like pure love!
