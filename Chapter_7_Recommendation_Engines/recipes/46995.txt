Ingredients:
3/4 teaspoon coriander seed
1/4 teaspoon fennel seed
1/4 teaspoon cumin seed
4 leaves fresh curry
4 large potatoes - peeled and cubed
1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, grated
1/2 teaspoon cumin seed
1/2 teaspoon coriander seed
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
salt to taste

Directions:
In a small skillet, over a low heat, dry roast the 3/4 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon fennel, and 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds individually until an aroma is starting to be given off. Combine all these with the curry leaves, and over a low heat, dry roast for about 5 minutes more. Do not burn Grind the spices and leaves using a mortar and pestle or a clean coffee grinder. Set aside.
Place potato cubes in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until about 1/2 cooked (time depends on individual microwave), about 3  to 5 minutes.
In a large skillet, melt the ghee over medium heat. Cook the onion, garlic, and  ginger in the ghee until golden and aromatic. Meanwhile, grind the remaining coriander and cumin seeds; add with one teaspoon fresh curry powder (prepared in the first step) to the onions and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in the potatoes, and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk, bring to a simmer, and then reduce heat to low. Cover, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Top with chopped fresh cilantro, and serve.
