Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F and spray a 1-quart casserole dish with non-stick.
Layer 1/2 the potatoes, top with the onion and add the remaining potatoes. Salt and pepper to taste.
In a sauce pan, melt butter and slowly add the flour and then salt, whisking constantly, to create a roux. After about one minute, slowly begin to add the milk, whisking constantly, keeping the mixture smooth. Continue to cook until thick. Add cheddar and stir until melted. Pour the cheese sauce over the potatoes.
Cover and bake for about 1-1/2 hours. Uncover and sprinkle the Parmesan and the top and turn the oven to broil. Broil until topping is lightly browned.

Description: 
Judging by the response I got from my family, this dish came out very well. The Parmesan crust was really nice and the sauce had all the flavors you'd want in an au gratin. It worked out to be 198 calories with 5 grams of fat and 2 of fiber per serving.
