Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Melt white chocolate chips over double boiler (being careful not to let any moisture get into the chocolate) and let cool before adding to mixture.
Cream the sugar and cream cheese together until smooth. Add the egg, vanilla and flour,mix together. Add the cream or milk a little at a time. Mix until smooth.
Slowly add cooled chocolate to the mixture while mixing.
Pour mixture into the shell. If using store bought crust, be careful to only put the filling just below the top edge (it will puff up a little while baking).

Description: 
White chocolate cheesecake heaven. Easy to make, not too many ingredients and is very comparable to the recipe I have that takes me four hours to complete. My recipe has some allowances for ingredients on hand vs. having to go buy stuff you don't use everyday. There will be a little extra filling if you use a store bought crust instead of making your own in a springform pan.
