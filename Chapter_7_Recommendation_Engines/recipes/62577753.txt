Ingredients:
1/3 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons thick plain yogurt
1 teaspoon steak sauce
dash of cayenne (optional)
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat the grill for medium heat.
In a shallow bowl, mix the mustard, honey, mayonnaise, and steak sauce.Set aside a small amount of the honey mustard sauce for basting, and dip the chicken into the remaining sauce to coat. Marinate for an hour at least for added flavor.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken over indirect heat for 18 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, or until juices run clear. Baste occasionally with the reserved sauce during the last 10 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning!
