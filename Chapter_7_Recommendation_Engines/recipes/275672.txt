Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping
3 drops super red gel food coloring, or more as needed
12 walnuts, or to taste
4 scoops vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Heat caramel topping in a bowl in a microwave until warm, about 30 seconds. Mix super red gel food coloring into the caramel. Dunk walnuts into caramel to coat, 1 at a time, and let excess drip off. Put coated walnuts on top of each scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzle with red caramel.
