Description: 
I found a recipe for coffee rubbed steak, and thought, wow, this would really be great for pork tenderloin!  I adapted this adding ancho chile powder (I live in Texas, so why not),and then adapted the sauce because it needed that extra kick. Be careful, this can be pretty spicy! You can adjust the ancho chile and the chipotles to taste.  You just can't mess this up.
