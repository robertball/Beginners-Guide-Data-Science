Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Ocean Spray® Craisins®)
boiling water as needed
1 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1 tablespoon powdered sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch springform pan with cooking spray and set on top of a baking sheet lined with foil.
Rehydrate the cranberries by placing them in a bowl and adding boiling water to cover. Let sit for about 10 minutes, drain well, and set aside.
Combine melted butter, sugar, eggs, almond extract, and orange zest in a medium bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl and stir into the butter mixture just until combined. Fold in pecans and cranberries. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool for about 15 minutes. Remove cake from the springform pan, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve.
