Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 small tomatoes - peeled, seeded and chopped
4 ounces diced cooked ham
2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, and saute until tender. Pour in the tomatoes, and cook for a minute, then stir in the ham and heat through. Remove from the heat, and mix in the eggs and parsley. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Unroll the can of pizza dough on a clean surface, and stretch or roll into a 14x10 inch rectangle. Cut into twelve 3 inch squares.
Place equal amounts of the filling into the centers of the squares. Brush the edges lightly with water. Fold in halves to form a triangle, pressing the edges to seal. Place on a greased cookie sheet and prick with a fork.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
