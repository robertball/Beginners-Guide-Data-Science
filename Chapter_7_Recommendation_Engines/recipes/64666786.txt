Ingredients:
2/3 cup coconut milk
1 cinnamon stick
1 whole clove
1/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup pitted dates, roughly chopped
1/4 dried apricots, roughly chopped
1/4 cup dried cherries
1 cup quinoa
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine coconut milk, cinnamon stick, clove, cranberries, apricots, dates and cherries.  Bring to a simmer.  Remove from heat, cover and let soak for about 10 minutes.  Strain, reserving liquid and remove clove and cinnamon stick.
In a fine-mesh strainer rinse the quinoa for about 2 minutes. Rub and swish the quinoa with your hand while rinsing. Drain.
Take liquid from  saved berries, adding chicken broth (or water) to make 2 cups.  Place in a medium saucepan with tight fitting lid with quinoa and  bring to a boil, add the salt.
Lower heat and cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Turn heat down to the lowest setting. Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes: Remove the pot from heat and let stand for 5 more minutes, covered. Don't peek!
Fluff the quinoa gently with a fork . If any liquid remains in the bottom of the pan or if the quinoa is still a bit crunchy, return the pot to low heat and cook, covered, for another 5 minutes, until all the water has been absorbed.
Take berry mixture and add to quinoa, serve hot or cold
