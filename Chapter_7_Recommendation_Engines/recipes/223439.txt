Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil for frying
2 small (4 inch) pita breads, torn into pieces
1 large English cucumber, finely diced
3 cups halved grape tomatoes
1/2 red onion, finely diced
3/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
3/4 cup chopped fresh mint
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground sumac, or to taste
1 clove garlic, crushed (or more to taste)
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 ounce sheep's milk feta cheese

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place pita pieces into the skillet without crowding. Fry in batches until golden brown and blot dry with paper towels.
Combine cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, parsley, mint, olive oil, lemon juice, sumac, garlic, salt, and ground black pepper in a bowl. Gently toss salad with fried pita pieces. Grate feta cheese on top using a small cheese grater.

Description: 
Fattoush is one of the most well known Middle Eastern salads and a standard dish on the 'mezza' (small dishes) table. It's a colorful tossed salad with a lemony garlic dressing, and if you've never made a single Arabic dish, this is a delicious and healthy place to start.
