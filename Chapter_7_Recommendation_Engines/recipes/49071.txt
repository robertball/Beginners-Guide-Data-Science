Ingredients:
1/2 cup egg whites
2 teaspoons vinegar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups white sugar
1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream
1 (10 ounce) package frozen sweetened strawberries, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Butter a large baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Blend in vinegar and vanilla. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. With a large spoon, drop meringue in 8 mounds (about 4 inches diameter), close together on baking sheet. Indent the center of each meringue with the back of a spoon.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven, and let shells cool in the oven, about 1 hour.
To serve: Fill each shell with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and smother with thawed strawberries.

Description: 
This is a simple recipe that tastes as wonderful and authentic as the dessert you would get in a German restaurant. I prefer to use strawberries, but anything goes with this one! You can make smaller mounds to have meringue cookies ...a low-fat snack!
