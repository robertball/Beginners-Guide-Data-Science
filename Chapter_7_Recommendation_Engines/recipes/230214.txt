Ingredients:
2 green onions, chopped
2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons frozen chopped spinach
2 tablespoons finely chopped white mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 pinch dried parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pork tenderloin, butterflied and pounded flat
1 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix green onions, bacon, Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Spread onto one side of pounded tenderloin. Roll tenderloin around the filling in a jelly-roll fashion. Coat rolled tenderloin with bread crumbs; place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
My husband showed up at home with a huge case of pork tenderloin. After a little figuring, this is the best of the best recipes that I was able to come up with. It was a big hit at our house and is easily doubled.
