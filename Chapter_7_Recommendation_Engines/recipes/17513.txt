Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups bottled (non-chlorinated) water

Directions:
Combine flour and spring water in a medium bowl; stir well. Cover loosely with a cloth and let sit on a kitchen counter for 2 to 3 days, or until bubbly.
To use and feed your starter; take out the amount needed for your recipe and then replace that amount with equal parts flour and spring water. If you keep your starter at room temperature it should be fed every other day, and if refrigerated, fed weekly. If you accumulate more starter than you need, simply pour a few cups down the drain before feeding it.

Description: 
It may take a little time, but making a good starter is easy! It is best to use organically grown flour and non-chlorinated water because they contain no chemicals which might kill the wild yeast.
