Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons coconut oil, or more as needed
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed, or more to taste
5 leaves fresh basil, chopped, or more to taste
1 cup multi-colored cherry tomatoes, halved, or more to taste
2 tablespoons pine nuts, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Coat the inside of spaghetti squash with olive oil and place, cut-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender and a fork can easily puncture the flesh, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool squash until easily handled, about 15 minutes.
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir asparagus until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes.
Shred the squash flesh using a fork to create long strands that resemble noodles. Mix squash and basil into asparagus, adding more coconut oil if too dry; cook and stir for 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and mix tomatoes and pine nuts into squash mixture.

Description: 
Spaghetti squash is an excellent healthy alternative to standard pastas, and is flavorful enough to stand on its own without a heavy sauce. Top with a little optional Parmesan cheese.
