Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 slices bread
6 slices bacon
6 eggs
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 6-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Press circles into the bread slices using a small juice glass. Place 1 circle into each muffin cup.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook bacon until almost crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
Beat eggs with onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Line each muffin cup with a slice of bacon. Fill each cup with egg mixture and top off with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
