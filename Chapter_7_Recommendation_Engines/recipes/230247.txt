Ingredients:
4 (1-inch thick) bone-in pork chops
1/4 cup real maple syrup
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the pork chops in the preheated skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange seared chops into a casserole dish.
Whisk maple syrup, water, onion, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl to dissolve the chili powder; pour over the pork chops.
Bake in preheated oven until the chops are no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes.
