Ingredients:
2 spring onions, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups corn kernels, or 1 fresh corn cob
1 TBS butter
1/4 cup   sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 cup gluten free bread mix
1/2 teaspoon bi-carb soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups fine cornmeal/maize flour
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C.
Finely chop spring onions, and cut corn kernels from one ear of corn. Saute in butter until spring onion is soft. Set aside.
Blend together sugar, oil, and beaten eggs. In another bowl, sift together flour, bi-carb soda, salt and maize flour/cornmeal.
Add dry ingredients gradually to creamed mixture.
Fold in sauteed spring onions and corn kernels.
Add the milk a small amount at a time, stirring just enough to blend after each addition. You may not need the full cup of milk.
Pour into well greased and floured loaf tin and bake 30-40 minutes at 200 degrees C (190 for fan-forced) until an inserted skewer or knife comes out clean.

Description: 
Oh so good, and gluten-free! I've made this in a large loaf tin, or poured the mixture into muffin trays and made individual sized cornbread muffins. Serve this with Chilli Con Carne or enjoy it on its own.
