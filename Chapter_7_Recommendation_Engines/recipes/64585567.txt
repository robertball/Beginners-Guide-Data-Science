Description: 
This soup is velvety smooth, thick and creamy thanks to a roux base. This soup helps satisfy my cravings for the brand name canned tomato soup that I can no longer eat. It's easy to make dairy free by using margarine and your choice of milk substitute. Dress it up with any combination of toppings or enjoy it plain.
