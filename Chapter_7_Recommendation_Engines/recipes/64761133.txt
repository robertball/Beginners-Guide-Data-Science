Ingredients:
2 kilos (4.4 pounds) fish fillets - more or less doesn't matter
1 can chopped tomatoes plus 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes, or 2 cans chopped tomatoes
1/3 cup olive oil
5 - 6 cups zucchini and/or bell peppers, leeks, yellow squash  - more or less is ok
1.5 Tablespoons Herb de Provence (or combine basil, thyme, and oregano)
For the topping:
1/2 cup ground almonds (almond flour)
1/2 cup hulled hemp seeds
1 heaping teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
1/ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
Black pepper to taste

Directions:
Spiralize, slice, or chop the vegetables and layer across the bottom of a baking dish.  Drizzle half the olive oil over the veggies, and sprinkle with the herbs.  Lay the washed and carefully de-boned fish fillets on top, then spread all the tomatoes over that.  Drizzle the rest of the olive oil over the tomatoes.  Combine the almond flour, hemp seeds, salt, red pepper flakes (if using) and dried parsley well together, then sprinkle all of it evenly over the top.   Bake at 175C (350F).  The fish is done when the whole thing is bubbling and steaming - but check with a knife in the center-most piece of fish.
