Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent roll dough
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 C. white sugar
2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 egg
1/4 C. butter, melted
1/4 C. confectioners sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
Press one can of the crescent rolls into the bottom of the prepared pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 egg and vanilla until smooth and creamy.
Spread over the crescent layer. Unroll the second can of crescent rolls and lay them on top of the cream cheese layer. Do not press down. Brush on the melted butter over top crescent rolls. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and put in the oven.
Bake for 25 minutes in pre-heated oven, or until the top is crisp and golden.
Serve warm or cold - it's excellent both ways
