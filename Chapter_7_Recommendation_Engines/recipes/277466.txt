Ingredients:
2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant chocolate pudding mix
4 cups cold milk
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed, divided
1 (14.4 ounce) package graham crackers
20 miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped

Directions:
Pour each package of pudding mix into a separate bowl. Add 2 cups cold milk to each bowl and whisk for 2 minutes. Set one bowl of chocolate pudding aside. Stir peanut butter and 1 cup whipped topping into the second bowl.
Place a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a trifle dish. Spread 1/3 of the chocolate pudding on top, top with 1/3 of the chocolate-peanut butter pudding, and layer with more graham crackers. Repeat layers 2 more times. Spread remaining frozen whipped topping on top and decorate with extra graham crackers and peanut butter cups.
Chill until pudding is firm and graham crackers have fluffed up, 6 hours to overnight.

Description: 
This is something I put together on the fly. It tastes just like a peanut butter cup so if you love Reese's® you are going to love this dessert. You can even make this pretty low fat using sugar-free pudding and fat-free cool whip.
