Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3/4 cup onion, minced fine
1 clove garlic, minced fine
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon Herbes de Provence
1 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
2 tablespoons cognac, brandy or port

Directions:
In a medium saucepan bring the chicken livers, lemon juice, onion, garlic, bay leaves, Herbes de Provence, stock, and 1 teaspoon of salt to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the livers are cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes.  Remove from heat, and let sit for 5 minutes.  Remove bay leaves.
Place the liver mixture into a food processor, and pulse a few times.  In the following steps do not over-process the mixture as this will infuse excess air into the paste resulting in an overly thin consistency.  Add butter to the mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing several times after each addition.  Add 1 teaspoon of salt, black pepper and cognac or brandy then pulse until smooth.  Spoon into a crock or serving bowl, cover and chill until firm.  For best flavor chill for at least one full day.
