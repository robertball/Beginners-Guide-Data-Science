Leftover Salmon Melt Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups cooked salmon
1 onion, chopped
1 - 2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
1/4 cup mayonnaise (or slightly less)
1 tablespoon mustard
2 tablespoons capers
1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 baguette
1-2 fresh tomatoes, sliced
1 cup cheese, finely shredded (mozzarella, parmesan, swiss, provolone, monterey jack, cheddar, etc.)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to a broil or 400 degrees F.
Mash the salmon with a fork.
Melt the butter or oil in a skillet on medium high heat.  Add the onion, season with salt and pepper and cook for about 5 - 7 minutes, until softened.  Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds or so.  Cool slightly.
Add the onion and garlic to the salmon.
Add the mayonnaise, mustard, capers, lemon juice and parsley.  Mix to combine.  Season with additional salt and pepper if desired.
You can also add other ingredients to suit your taste:  hard boiled egg, minced jalapeno, pickles, celery, etc.
Slice the baguette on a bias.  You should have about 10 - 12 Salmon Melts.
Toast the bread in the oven first - watch closely!  You only need to toast for 1 - 2 minutes.  If you bake it in the oven it will take longer, but less likely to burn.
Top the bread with the salmon mixture.  Add a slice or two of tomatoes to the salmon and then sprinkle with cheese.
Bake in the broiler for 3 - 5 minutes, or at 400 degrees for a little longer, until the cheese is melted and golden.

Description: 
I use this recipe when I have leftover baked salmon.  If I do not think I will have enough for this dish, I add canned salmon.
