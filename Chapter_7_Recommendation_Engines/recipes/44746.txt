3 tablespoons water
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 (12 ounce) jar cherry preserves

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Stir together water, vinegar, corn syrup, preserves, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes.
Brush 1/4 to 1/3 cup of this glaze over your ham about 30 minutes before it is finished baking. Stir any ham drippings into the remaining glaze and serve alongside the sliced ham.

Description: 
This cherry ham glaze give any ham a delicious, sweet, and slightly tart taste.  I glazed a ham for Thanksgiving with this, and my company couldn't get enough of it.  I was out of ham by the next day!
