Description: 
Often imitated, never duplicated. Just make sure that after you make this for breakfast, you have a window of opportunity to go back to bed, because you won't be able to do much after consuming this. Cast-iron skillet is preferred. I prefer the taste that the maple sausage lends to the dish, however you could easily substitute regular or sage sausage in lieu of the maple. Single ladies, sit back and wait for proposals of marriage!
