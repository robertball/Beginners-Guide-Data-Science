Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
4 tablespoons melted butter
4 tablespoons water
1/2 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
4 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/4 cup raisins (optional)
1 teaspoon milk
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
4 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Instructions for cinnamon buns using the mixer: Combine water, yeast, sugar. Allow to proof for about 15 minutes in warm place (cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel). Mix remaining wet ingredients for dough in mixer. Add yeast mixture. Mix till combined. 3)Switch whisk attachment w/ the dough hook. Slowly mix in the flour w/ the dough hook, on a low speed. Once flour is more or less blended, knead at a high speed till it forms a sort of ball around the dough hook. Avoid adding lots of extra flour to avoid dry buns. Put in large greased. Cover & let rise in warm place till doubled in size (about 30-40 minutes- don't leave longer, even not yet doubled). Roll out to a large rectangle.  Mix together the softened butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread over dough. Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and raisins, if desired. Starting with the widest end, roll the dough into a log. Pinch to seal seams. Cut into 1/2 inch to 1 inch slices, and place in a greased 9x13 inch pan. Place in a draft-free space, and allow to rise until doubled.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. To make frosting, mix the milk, confectioners sugar, softened butter and vanilla in a small bowl. Spread over warm cinnamon rolls.
