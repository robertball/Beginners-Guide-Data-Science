Ingredients:
3 medium beets, scrubbed, leaves trimmed
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 medium ripe Avocado from Mexico
2 Granny Smith apples
Lemon juice, as needed
Salt and pepper
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley (optional)
1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese
2 tablespoons pine nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Wash and scrub the beets. Pat dry. Place on large piece of aluminum foil. Lightly coat with olive oil. Add dash of salt and pepper. For even roasting, wrap foil over, covering beets completely, and crimp ends. Roast until cooked through, 30 to 50 minutes. Remove, uncover and let cool. Do not discard oil in the foil; you can use this later as dressing.
Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pit and skin. Place flat side down on cutting board. Slice horizontally. Squeeze lemon juice on to prevent browning. Cut Granny Smith same way, but leave skin on. Squeeze lemon juice on to prevent browning.
When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip their peels off using your fingers or a paring knife. Slice crosswise. Stack on plate alternating beets, apples and avocados. Sprinkle crumbled goat cheese over top. Garnish with parsley and pine nuts if desired. Drizzle the used olive oil from roasting and the rest of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
