Ingredients:

Directions:
1 pkg wonton wrappers
1 pound finely grated jalapeno jack cheese
oil for deep frying
Place a 1-2 teaspoon of grated cheese in the center of each wonton.  Fold the top and bottom corners in toward each other and roll it up like a little egg roll.  You will have to seal the wonton with a little water where the ends meet.
Heat oil in a deep pot.  Fry the wontons two or three at a time.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve immediately with salsa or reheat them in the oven until they sizzle.
