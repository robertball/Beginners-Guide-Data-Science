Ingredients:
3/4 C Wheat Flour + 3 TBS
1/4 C Corn meal
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
3 packets of Splenda
1 C skim milk
1 TSP lemon juice
1/4 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp vanilla
2 egg whites, beatened
2 TBS olive oil

Directions:
Combine the dry ingredients in a small bowl.
In a cup, mix together the skim milk, lemon juice and lemon zest.  Let sit for 5 minutes.
In the meantime, in a separate bowl, beat the 2 egg whites with a fork until frothy.  Add in the oil and vanilla. Mix in the milk. Beat with the fork until thoroughly combined.
Fold the wet ingredients into the dry mixture and let sit for 5 minutes; batter will thicken.  It should be a medium consistency.
While waiting on the batter, preheat a griddle pan, prepared with cooking spray, over medium heat.
Once the batter is thickened and the pan is ready to go, ladle 4 cakes onto the pan, assuring they don't touch (3 1/2 - 4 inches in diameter).  Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, meaning the pancakes are ready to be flipped.  Once flipped, cook for an additional minute or so on the otherside, or until golden brown.  Adjust stove temperature as needed, as not to overcook the pancakes.
