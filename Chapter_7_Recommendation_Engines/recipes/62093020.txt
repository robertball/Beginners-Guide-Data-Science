https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
Meatballs:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups soft bread crumbs (I use whole wheat bread)
1 package dry onion soup mix
Sauce:
1/2 cup sour cream (regular or light)
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 2/3 cup water

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine together all ingredients for meatballs and mix well. (It's easiest to mix with bare hands!)
Form into golf ball size balls and fry in a large skillet over medium heat.
In a separate bowl combine ingredients for sauce and pour over cooked meatballs in skillet and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to scrape up the bits of meatballs from the bottom of skillet and to heat meatballs evenly.
The sauce is excellent served over baked or mashed potatoes or egg noodles.
