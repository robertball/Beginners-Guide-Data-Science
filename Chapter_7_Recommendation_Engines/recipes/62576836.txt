Ingredients:
1 lb green beans
1 medium red onion
6 oz goat cheese
1/3c olive oil
1/3c vegetable oil
1/3c red wine vinegar
1 tsp mustard powder
1 tsp + 3 tbs sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/3c cider vinegar
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes

Directions:
Trim green beans and blanch in boiling water for approximately 5 minutes.  Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Chill in the refridgerator until cold.
Slice the red onion thinly and put into a bowl. Combine the cider vinegar, 3 tbs sugar and red pepper flakes in a small sauce pan, heat until sugar is just disolved.  Add the vinegar/sugar/pepper solution to the onion in the bowl and allow to sit for 3-4 hours stirring occasionally.
Combine the Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil and Red Wine Vinegar in a jar, add the salt, pepper, mustard powder, Worcestershire Sauce and remaining tsp sugar.  Put a lid on the jar and shake vigorously to combine.
Mix the chilled beans with about 1/3 of the vinaigrette (reserve remainder another use), place on a platter. Drain the pickling liquids from the onions. Sprinkle the onions on top of the beans. Crumble the gaot cheese on top of all.
