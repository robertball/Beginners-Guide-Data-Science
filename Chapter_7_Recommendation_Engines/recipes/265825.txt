Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
4 eggs
4 spreadable cheese wedges (such as The Laughing Cow®), cut into small pieces
2 smoked sausage links, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Morton® Season-All®)
1 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk eggs and cheese together in a small bowl. Pour into the skillet; cook and stir until scrambled and set, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a separate pan. Add sausage, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and seasoned salt. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and sausage is browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
Divide scrambled eggs between 2 bowls. Place sausage mixture over the eggs. Drizzle pan drippings on top. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the bowls to create a crust.
