Ingredients:
Seasoning:
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce paste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 dashes ground white pepper
1/2 pound ground pork
1/3 cup Taiwanese pickled cucumbers with brine, chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 small shallots, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground star anise
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Mix rice wine, soy sauce paste, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper together in a bowl.
Mix ground pork with brine from cucumbers together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add pork mixture; cook and stir until no longer pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Push pork and shallots to the sides of the skillet, making a space in the center. Add garlic, ginger, and star anise; stir.
Pour water into the skillet; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer until sauce reduces to about 1 cup. Stir in chopped cucumbers. Stir in rice wine mixture; cook until flavors combine, 4 to 6 minutes.
Top pork mixture with sesame oil and green onions.
