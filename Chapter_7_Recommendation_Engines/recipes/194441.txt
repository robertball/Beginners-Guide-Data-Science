Ingredients:
4 medium portabella mushrooms, stems removed
1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch slices
3 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 fully ripened Avocado from Mexico, halved, pitted and sliced
2 tablespoons low-fat plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
4 whole grain hamburger buns, toasted
4 roasted red peppers

Directions:
Brush mushrooms and onion slices with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.
Heat large skillet or grill pan over medium heat until hot. Add mushrooms; cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes, turning once.
Transfer mushrooms to plate, cavity side up; cover to keep warm. In same skillet, cook onion slices until golden, about 8 minutes, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile, combine in small bowl, 1/2 of the Avocado, yogurt, garlic and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; mash until smooth.
Spoon onions and roasted peppers into mushroom cavities, divided equally. Spread smooth Avocado mixture on bottom of each bun; top each with stuffed mushrooms.
Top with remaining sliced Avocado. Cover with tops of buns.
