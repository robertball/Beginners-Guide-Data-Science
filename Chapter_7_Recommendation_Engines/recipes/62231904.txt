Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
4 pounds beef, short ribs, cut into 3" pcs
1/2 teaspoon pepper, black
3 cups onion, sliced
1/4 cup dry red wine, beef broth, or water
1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms, sauteed in butter
1 cup sour cream
salt, to taste
2 tablespoons parsley, fresh, minced

Directions:
Set a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle short ribs with salt then add to hot skillet. Brown short ribs well on all sides. Season the meat with pepper; turn into a bowl. Add the oil to the skillet and saute the onion for about 3 minutes; transfer to the slow-cooker. Swirl the water, broth, or red wine in the still hot skillet and scrape up the browned bits. Add to the slow cooker with the beef ribs. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours, or until short ribs are very tender.
Remove short ribs to a serving platter and keep warm. Saut√© mushrooms in a large skillet until tender; add the cooking liquid to the skillet. Simmer, scraping up the pan juices, until the sauce is reduced and thickened. Remove skillet from the heat. Stir in the sour cream; return to the heat just long enough to heat through. Taste and adjust seasonings. Do not boil. Pour sauce over the meat and sprinkle with parsley.
