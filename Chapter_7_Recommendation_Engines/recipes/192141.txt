Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large English cucumber, cut into 1/4 inch slices
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
3 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Place cucumber slices into a colander in the sink and lightly sprinkle with salt, tossing to coat. Allow cucumber to drain for 30 minutes. Gently shake the colander to remove any excess liquid and transfer cucumber to a large bowl. Stir in rice vinegar and honey, making sure to coat each cucumber slice evenly. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Toss cucumber and return to the refrigerator for an additional hour. Serve chilled.

This is my mom's recipe for delicious, easy-to-make pickles that are sweet and sour! They're not conventional pickles, but taste like them. Use any substitute like sliced carrots, (daikon) radish, or even fruit!
