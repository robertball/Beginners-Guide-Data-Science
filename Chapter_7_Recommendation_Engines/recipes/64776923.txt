Ingredients:
6 cups sliced, peeled apples (5 or 6 med.)
2 tbsp water
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tbsp flour
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp ginger
1/8 tsp salt
Pastry for double crust pie (deep dish)

Directions:
In saucepan, combine apples, water and juice; cook over med-low heat just until the apples are tender.
Remove from heat & cool. Do not drain.
In a large bowl, mix sugars, flour, spices & salt; add apples and toss to coat.
Place in pastry. Cover & seal.
Bake @ 450 x 10 min. Then @ 350 x 35 - 45 min longer or until golden brown.
At least partially cool prior to serving to let juices set up, but if you just cannot wait, then prepare for some syrupy spills.
*I put a foil lined cookie sheet or pizza pan on a rack below the pie to catch any spills while baking.
