Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 boneless pork chops, 1/2-inch thick
salt and pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups dry white wine
1 1/4 cups whole berry cranberry sauce
1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh sage leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped Italian flat leaf parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Fry in the oil until browned on each side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the pork to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.
Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium and add the garlic. Cook and stir just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine and cranberry sauce. Simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sage and thyme. Return the pork to the skillet and turn to coat with the sauce. Place on plates to serve and garnish with fresh parsley.
