Ingredients:
•	1/2 cup vegetable stock
•	1/4 cup golden raisins
•	2 tbsp vegetable oil
•	1 shallot, minced
•	1 clove garlic, minced
•	2 tbsp black sesame seeds
•	1/4 cup shredded carrots
•	1/3 cup chopped raw almonds
•	1 cup fonio grains
•	1/4 vegetable stock
•	Salt and pepper, to taste
•	1/8 cup pomegranate seeds

Directions:
1.	Directions (numbered):
Add the raisins to 1/2 cup vegetable stock. Set aside.
2.	Heat the oil in a deep skillet. Sauté the shallot, garlic, black sesame seeds, carrots, and almonds. Sauté until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add the fonio and mix together so the fonio absorbs the flavors of the other ingredients. About 2 minutes.
3.	Add the 1/2 cup of the vegetable stock and raisins. Stir and allow the fonio to absorb the liquid. About 5 minutes. Add more stock if needed to cook the fonio until it is soft. You may not need more than 1/2 cup plus two tbsp in total. This will depend on the brand and quality of the fonio. Salt and pepper to taste.
4.	Remove from the heat when all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork. Top with fresh pomegranate seeds before serving.

Description: 
Fonio grains are mixed with aromatic vegetables, sesame seeds, nuts and raisins for a nutritious alternative to rice pilaf. Serve this with your favorite savory meat or fish dish. Fonio is one of the most forgiving grains out there. It reheats splendidly, too. This dish can be made ahead of time and simply reheated by adding a bit of stock and a turn or two in the microwave.
