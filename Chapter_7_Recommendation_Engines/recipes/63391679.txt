Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
1 cup fresh peeled ginger sliced approx 1/4"
1 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice (approx 4-6 lemons)
3 cups ice cold water

Directions:
Combine sugar, water and ginger in a small saucepan. Cook until it comes to a boil and take off heat to cool to warm.
Pour into a blender and puree until liquefied. Pour the puree into a fine strainer and press on the ginger to extract all the syrup.
Pour the ginger syrup, lemon juice and ice cold water into a pitcher. Refrigerate for 30 - 40 minutes and serve over ice.
Garnish with a lemon wedge or a slice.
