Ingredients:
3 (4 ounce) bars dark chocolate, chopped, divided
4 tablespoons coarsely chopped pistachios
3 tablespoons freeze-dried raspberries
1 tablespoon coconut chips

Directions:
Heat 2/3 of the dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chocolate is nearly melted but some chunks remain, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from microwave and stir until completely smooth. Add the remaining 1/3 of dark chocolate. Stir well until all the chocolate has melted.
Lay out a large sheet of parchment paper on a flat work surface. Pour melted chocolate onto parchment and spread into a thin, even layer using a spatula. Scatter pistachios, dried raspberries, and coconut chips quickly over chocolate before it sets.
Leave the chocolate to set fully, about 45 minutes. Break into randomly sized pieces and store in an airtight container.
