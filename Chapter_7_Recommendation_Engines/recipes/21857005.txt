Ingredients:
2 sticks butter
.5 cup superfine sugar
1 egg white
1 tsp lemon juice
pinch of salt
2.5 cups flour
jam
1 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Cream together butter and superfine sugar.
Add egg white, lemon juice, salt, and flour. Mix well, let stand 1 hour.
Roll out dough 1/4 inch thick, cut out designs with cookie cutter. Punch out or cut several small circles (1/4 to 1/2 inch) in half of the cookies.
Put on lightly greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 for about 7-9 minutes, once they are lightly golden.
Add a thin layer of jam to the tops of the whole cookies and use the ones with circles cut out as the tops, creating little cookie sandwiches.
Put powdered sugar in a sifter or small strainer and use to dust the cookies.

Description: 
These holiday jam cookies are fun to make as a family and are even more fun to eat together! I usually use a clean pen cap to punch out just the right size circles from the top halves - if you do it artfully and you have a Christmas Tree cookie cutter, you can make them look like little ornaments. (Remember: the amount of cookies made by the recipe depends on the size of your cookie cutter.) Feel free to experiment with different flavors of jam... raspberry is my personal favorite!
