Ingredients:
2 Italian sausage links
2 Tbsp butter
2 Tbsp flour
2 cups whole milk
Cajun seasoning (recipe   or store bought)
2 sheets puff pastry, thawed
1 cup cooked & shredded (or canned) chicken
3-4 drops liquid smoke
1 cup rice, cooked al dente
½ cup onion, finely chopped
½ cup red bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic (more if desired), minced
½ cup raw shrimp, peeled and deveined (no tails)
1 egg, scrambled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°
Begin by browning the Italian sausage in a skillet over medium high heat.  Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until brown.  Remove from heat and slice into ¼” slices.
While the sausage is cooking, melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat.  Once melted, add the flour and whisk in.  Cook on medium for 1 minute, or until frothy.  Whisk in milk.  Turn heat down to medium low and continue to cook, ensuring that the sauce doesn’t boil over.  Add in Cajun seasoning to taste (approx. 3 Tbsp for a spicy pot pie).  Continue to cook, stirring often, while you work on the dish.  You want this to reduce until it coats the surface of a spoon dipped in it.
Grease a pie pan with butter and lay in one puff pastry sheet.
Combine the chicken and liquid smoke.  To this add the rice, onion, bell pepper, garlic, shrimp and Italian sausage.  Pour in enough sauce to make a wet mixture.  Pour mixture into pie pan and pour another ¼ or so of sauce over it.  Place the second puff pastry sheet over the mixture, stretching to cover the whole pan.  Brush with the egg.
Place in the oven near the top and bake until the top crust is golden brown and the center of the crust is flaky, approximately 20-30 minutes.

This recipe was inspired by a dish I used to order when I worked at the American Cafe.  I finally was brave enough to give it a try and it's pretty close!
