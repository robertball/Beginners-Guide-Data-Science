1 cup pitted prunes
½ Cup pitted Spanish green olives (I used 1 c)
½ cup of capers with a bit of juice
6 Bay leaves
1 cup of brown sugar (use less next time)

¼ cup of Italian parsley or fresh coriander (cilantro), finely chopped.
For Middle Eastern Style substitute in:
Kalamata olives
Less oregano and 1 heaping Tablespoon of Cumin
