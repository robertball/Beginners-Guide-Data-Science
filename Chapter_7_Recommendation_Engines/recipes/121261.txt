Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 cup cold butter

2 cups sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
6 egg yolks, beaten
1 cup whipping cream
5 cups sliced fresh or frozen rhubarb

6 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
3/4 cup sugar

In a bowl, combine the flour and sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing filling. In a bowl, combine the sugar, flour and salt. Stir in egg yolks and cream. Add rhubarb. Pour over crust.

In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla. Spread over hot filling. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours before serving. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
I hear so many nice comments when I serve this special springtime dessert. I make it often when our abundant rhubarb is in its prime. It's just as homey as a rhubarb custard pie, but it easily serves a large group.    --Jessica Moch                                                           Bismarck, North Dakota
