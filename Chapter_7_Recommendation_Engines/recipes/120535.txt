Description: 
These creative kabobs make a great first impression, according to Nancy Morrison. 'I brought them to a neighborhood dinner when we moved to our new home. People couldn't wait 'til dinner and started snatching them as soon as I walked in the door,' she reports from Midlothian, Virginia. 'They just couldn't resist the tantalizing aroma.'
