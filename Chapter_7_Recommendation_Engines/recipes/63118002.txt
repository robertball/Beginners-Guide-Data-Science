Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork loin roast
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed fine
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup flour
1 tbsp vegetable oil
3 small apples, peeled and sliced
1 tbsp. butter
1 tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon

Directions:
Cut pork loin into medallions.
Using a ziplock bag and a rolling pin, crush the rosemary to desired coarseness (I like it pretty finely crushed).  In a small bowl, combine the sage, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, salt and pepper and flour.
Heat vegetable oil in a frypan.  Dredge the pork medallions in the flour mixture and pan fry until just cooked through but still moist and tender.
If desired, use pan drippings to make a gravy.
In a small saucepan, stir together apples, butter, sugar and cinnamon and cook over medium heat until apples are softened.
