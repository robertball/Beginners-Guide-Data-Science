Ingredients:
3/4 cup rum
1/3 cup white sugar
1 green apple, cored and sliced
1 orange, sliced
1 lemon, sliced
1 lime, sliced
1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine
1 cup orange juice
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage

Directions:
Stir rum and sugar together in a large pitcher to dissolve the sugar; add apple slices, orange slices, lemon slices, and lime slices.
Crush fruit slightly against the bottom of the pitcher to squeeze some juice into the rum mixture. Pour wine and orange juice into the pitcher; stir. Add lemon-lime soda and stir just before serving.

Description: 
Like most of my recipes this is a combination of several others because I couldn't find one that was exactly what I wanted. This has been a big hit every time I've served it.
