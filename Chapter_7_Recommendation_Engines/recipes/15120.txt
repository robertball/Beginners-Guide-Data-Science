Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
4 tablespoons cold water
1 pound lean ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup dill pickle juice
1/3 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped dill pickles
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
To Make Pat-in-Pan Pastry: In a medium bowl, mix 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles tiny peas. Add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring with a fork after each addition. Mix lightly just until pastry almost cleans sides of bowl. Pat into bottom and sides of an 8 inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
To Make Filling: Crumble ground beef into a large skillet and saute over medium heat for 1 minute. Add onion and garlic. Continue to saute until onion is browned, about 10 minutes. Drain grease from mixture.
Sprinkle beef mixture with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup flour. Stir in pickle liquid, milk, pickles, and 1 cup shredded cheese. Spoon mixture into pastry shell.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining 1 cup cheese and bake an additional 5 minutes, until pastry is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.
