Description: 
MY MOM was known as the best cook in the country. This delicious glaze was in her collection of handwritten recipes. I laminated the ones I use most often, and this favorite was included.    It's easy to prepare, and everyone seems to like ham made this way. -Dorothy Smith, El Dorado, Arkansas
