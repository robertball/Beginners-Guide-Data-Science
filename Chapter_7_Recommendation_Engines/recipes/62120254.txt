Ingredients:
0.900 kg ground beef (medium package)
5 medium potatoes (or more if you like a lot of potatoes on top)
2 cans creamed corn
1 can whole kernel corn
3 tbsp Whorcheshire sauce
1 to 2 tsp Montreal Steak spice
1 medium onion
Parsley (enough to add a bit of color: about 1-2 tsp dried)
Paprika
2 dabs margarine
milk

Directions:
Boil water to cook potatoes
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Peel potatoes and cook until soft
Saute onions until translucent, set aside
Brown meat, drain fat
Add onions to meat and mix well
Add Whorcheshire sauce & Montreal Steak spice to meat mixture and stir until well mixed
Once potatoes are tender, mash
Then with hand mixer blend with margarine, milk and parsley until smooth
In a deep dish, place meat mixture first
Then place both corn as the second layer
Top layer will be the potatoes.
Sprinkle with paprika
Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes or until potatoes are nice and done.
We use Ketchup as a condiment with this dish.
This can also be made with just plain ground beef, and plain mashed potatoes and creamed corn if there are picky eaters.
