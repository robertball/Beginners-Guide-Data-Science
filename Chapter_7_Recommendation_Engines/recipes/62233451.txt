Ingredients:
1 1/8 C Milk
1 Egg
2 T Butter
1 t Salt
3 1/2 C Bread Flour
1/4 C Sugar
2 t Yeast

Directions:
Add ingredients in order to bread machine. I like to warm the milk in the microwave and leave the egg out so it is room temperature (for the yeast). Make sure the milk doesn't get above 85 degrees or it will kill the yeast in the bread maker.
Set on basic setting or dough setting.
Take bread out of bread maker after second knead (before the second rise).
Flatten dough and roll into a loaf. Place in large greased loaf pan.
Cover with greased plastic wrap.
Let rise for 45 min to 1 hour.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 min or until golden brown.
Butter the top of the loaf as soon as it comes out of the oven.
