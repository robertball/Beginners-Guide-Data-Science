Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/3 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/3 cup Italian-style panko bread crumbs
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) halibut fillets

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, spray an ovenproof wire rack with cooking spray, and place rack on the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Stir panko bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in another shallow dish.
Gently dip 1 fillet in yogurt mixture to coat completely; press fillet into bread crumbs. Place coated fillet on the wire rack on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining fillet.
Bake fillets in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 18 to 22 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).

Description: 
This fast-and-easy dish was an instant success at my house, even in my fish-hesitant family. The panko crisps up beautifully, and the halibut is tender, moist, and delicately-flavored.

 This was inspired, in part, by several Weight WatchersÂ® recipes; I don't know the calories or points exactly, but it's a very simple lean and low-calorie dinner. It pairs well with roasted or stuffed tomatoes (can cook at the same temperature!) and a salad. Serve with lemon wedges.
