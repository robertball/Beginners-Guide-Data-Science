Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 (10 ounce) jar red maraschino cherries
3/4 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup confectioners' sugar
softened cream cheese (optional)

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  In another bowl, whisk egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Drain cherries, reserving 2 tablespoons of juice for glaze (discard remaining juice or save for another use).  Chop cherries; fold chips, pecans and cherries into the batter. Drop by tablespoonfuls into greased or paper-lined heart-shaped or miniature muffin cups.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-13 minutes or until muffins test done.  Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks.  Combine confectioners' sugar and reserved cherry juice to make a thin glaze; drizzle over muffins.  Serve with cream cheese if desired.
