Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground paprika
2 teaspoons onion powder
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons oil
2 pounds beef round steak, cut into serving-size pieces
1/2 cup diced onion
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup beef broth
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine flour, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder in a resealable plastic bag; shake to mix. Add beef a few pieces at a time and shake to coat.
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef to a baking pan and keep warm.
Saute onion in the beef drippings in the Dutch oven; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in cream of chicken soup, beef broth, water, and pepper. Bring gravy to a boil. Remove from heat.
Pour gravy over beef in the baking pan. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 hours.

Description: 
The meat is so tender and moist and the gravy is so flavorful. Instead of baking it in the oven, I use my pressure cooker. This is wonderful with mashed potatoes, rice, or noodles.
