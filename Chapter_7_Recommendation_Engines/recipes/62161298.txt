Description: 
When we order Gyros from our local Gyro place I always order an extra with the sauce on the side and use the meat, onion & sauce to make this pizza the next day.  I usually snack on the pita while I'm cooking the pizzas.  You can leave the crust whole, I just think it is easier to work with when it is smaller.  You can also add tomatoes &/or olives to your taste.
