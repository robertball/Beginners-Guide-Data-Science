Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 onion, minced
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until it has caramelized to a dark, golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar, and cook for 1 minute before stirring in the chicken bouillon and cream. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted.

Description: 
The vinegar and cream go very well together.  Best when sauteed chicken and asparagus is added to the mix. I use this sauce on pasta all the time.
