Ingredients:
1 (1 pound 1.5 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker速 sugar cookie mix
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 egg

12 caramels, unwrapped
1 tablespoon milk

36 pecan halves

Directions:
Mix cookie dough as directed on package, stirring in flour in bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls; place about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 11 to 12 minutes.  Cool 1 minute; place cookies on cooling rack.
Microwave caramels and milk uncovered on High 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds, stirring once, until caramels are melted. Dip one side of each cookie at an angle into caramel mixture to coat top half; spread if necessary.  If caramel thickens, add up to 1 teaspoon additional milk and reheat.
Spread about 1 teaspoon fudge topping on top of each cookie. Place pecan half on topping. Let stand about 15 minutes until toppings are set.  Store between layers of waxed paper in tightly covered container at room temperature.
