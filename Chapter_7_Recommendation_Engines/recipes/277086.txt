Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lemon-pepper seasoning
1/2 cup harissa paste, divided
1 pound chicken wing pieces, drumettes and flats
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon finely grated fresh lemon zest

Directions:
Mix together lemon-pepper seasoning and 1 tablespoon harissa paste in a bowl. Pat dry the wings and place in a resealable plastic bag. Add seasoning mix, close bag, and shake, massaging the seasoning until every part of wings is well coated. Refrigerate for 1 hour or more.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Remove chicken wings from refrigerate and allow to come to room temperature while oven preheats.
Whisk remaining harissa paste and honey in a small bowl until fully mixed.
Place wings, meaty-sides up, on the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1 inch between each wing. Baste exposed sides with harissa-honey sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn each wing and baste with remaining sauce. Bake until wings are cooked throughout and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes more.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and turn on the oven's broiler. Crisp wings under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes, if desired. Top with fresh lemon zest before serving.

Description: 
You don't need a bunch of ingredients to make out-of-this-world wings. A few flavor packed ingredients will do! Tangy and woody lemon-pepper mixed with the complex, smoky spice of harissa will give your usual wings some extra lift.
