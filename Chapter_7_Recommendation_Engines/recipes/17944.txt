Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup milk
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup rum
1 cup whipping cream
1/4 pinch white sugar
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine gelatin and cold water; set aside to soften. Combine milk and 1/2 cup sugar in a small glass bowl. Microwave for 3 minutes or until milk begins to boil.
In a steady stream, pour hot milk into beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Cook custard in the microwave, whisking after each minute, until it thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir in softened gelatin and mix until melted. Stir in rum.
Let filling cool to room temperature. (If you refrigerate it, stir occasionally to prevent gelatin from setting too soon. See Editor's Note.)
In a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form; beat in 1/4 cup sugar.
Set aside 1/2 cup of whipped cream for garnish; keep refrigerated. Fold remaining whipped cream into eggnog mixture. Pour filling into pie crust and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.
Garnish with reserved whipped cream and a dusting of nutmeg.

Description: 
A pie for the microwave. A graham cracker crust may be substituted for pre-baked pie crust. Creating this pie is a bit to do, but well worth the time spent!
