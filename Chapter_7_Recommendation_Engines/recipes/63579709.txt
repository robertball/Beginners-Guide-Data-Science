Ingredients:
1.5 lbs of lean beef
3/4 cup of flour
1/4 cup of butter
32 oz of beef broth
1 cup of red wine
1 packet of dry onion soup mix
3 large baking potatoes
1 lb bag of carrots

Directions:
Cut the beef into 1-inch cubes. put the beef cubes and the flour in a gallon size Ziploc bag and toss to coat.  Melt butter in pan and add the flour-coated beef cubes to the pan.  Saute lightly.
Pour the beef broth and wine to a crock pot.  Turn crock pot to high.  Add the dry onion soup mix and whisk until blended.  Transfer the sauteed beef to the crock pot.
Peel the potatoes and carrots and then cut into fairly large pieces (a bit larger than the beef cubes).  Rinse, then add to the crock pot.
Cook in the crock pot on high for about 3-5 hours or on low for 6-8 hours (each crock pot is different which is why there is such a variance in the cooking time)

Description: 
I made this for my son, Mike, who has just been fitted with braces and was getting very frustrated with the long list of things he could no longer eat.  He loves steak and this way he got his steak and it was so tender that he didn't have to worry about his braces.

Make a loaf (or two) of bread with this. I just use Pillsbury French Loaf (refrigerated section by the crescent rolls) and it's perfect for sopping up all of the yummy gravy.
