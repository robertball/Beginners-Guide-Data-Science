Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup self-rising cornmeal
1 cup buttermilk
1 (14.75-ounce) can cream style corn
2 eggs well beaten
1 large onion, chopped
1 (4-ounce) can sliced jalapenos, drained (optional)1 cup shredded cheddar

Directions:
the vegetable oil to the bottom of a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Place the skillet in the oven and preheat the oven to 350°.While the oven and skillet preheat, brown the ground beef then drain the grease away.In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, buttermilk, cream style corn, and beaten eggs until well mixed.Once the skillet is hot (a pinch of cornmeal sprinkled in the skillet will sizzle when it's ready), pour half of the batter into the bottom of the skillet. Sprinkle the ground beef, chopped onion, and jalapenos over the batter. (The jalapenos are optional and the cornbread is just as tasty without them. Mom always made it without them when I was a kid.) Sprinkle the cheese over the other ingredients then top with other half of the batter. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden brown. Allow the cornbread to cool slightly in the pan before flipping out onto a serving plate.

Description: 
I’m celebrating by sharing one of my most favorite cornbread recipes… My Mom’s Mexican Cornbread.  With the ground beef and veggies, it’s a great meal all by itself, but it complements other dishes so well.  The recipe calls for sliced jalapenos, but if heat isn’t your thing, you can always leave those out.  Mom always did that when I was a kid and the cornbread is just as delicious!
