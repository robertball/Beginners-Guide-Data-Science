Ingredients:
1 14-oz can diced tomatoes
6 6-in flour tortillas
12oz lean ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 red or green sweet pepper, chopped
1 tsp. chili powder
1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
4oz cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Brush 9-in pie plate with EVOO. Spread a large spoonful of tomatoes on the bottom of the pie plate. Arrange 4 of the tortillas on top of the tomatoes and up the sides of the plate, overlapping as necessary. Set aside.
In a large skillet cook beef, onion, and pepper over med.-high heat until browned; drain off fat. Add chili powder and cinnamon; cook and stir 1 min. Stir in about half the remaining tomatoes. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cook, uncovered, 2 min. Spoon over tortillas in plate. Cut remaining tortillas into large strips. Layer tortilla strips and cheese over beef mixture. Top with remaining diced tomatoes.
Bake, uncovered, 20-25 min. or until tortillas are lightly browned. Let stand 5 min. Cut into wedges to serve. Top with cilantro, dollop of sour cream or guacamole, if desired.
