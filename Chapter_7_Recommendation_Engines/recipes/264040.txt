Ingredients:
3 pounds potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces, or more to taste
1 cup avocado flesh
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 small bunch parsley
1/4 onion
2 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Add potatoes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until fork-tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Drain immediately and rinse with cold water. Set aside.
Combine avocado, oil, parsley, onion, garlic, lemon juice, and mustard in a blender. Blend until dressing is smooth. Thin, if necessary, by adding 1 tablespoon of water at a time.
Transfer cooked potatoes to a large bowl and pour dressing on top. Gently mix until thoroughly coated. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is a perfect vegan alternative to the traditional potato salad. It is also a much healthier option. By substituting avocado and olive oil for mayonnaise you get the usual creaminess without all the calories. Garnish with chives or green onions. Serve immediately or chill in the refrigerator.
