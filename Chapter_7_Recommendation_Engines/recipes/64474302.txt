Ingredients:
5-7 lb Pork roast, boneless or bone-in (shoulder or butt would be perfect)
10 garlic cloves, sliced thinly
1T salt
1t each dried oregano, basil, and rosemary

Directions:
Pat the pork roast dry.
Make small slits in the roast and insert garlic, evenly all over the roast.
Mix salt and herbs in a small bowl.
Rub seasoning mixture evenly over the roast.
Place roast in the slow cooker and cook on low for 14-16 hours.
NOTE:
As the roast cooks you will acquire juice in the bottom. You can either leave it be, or half-way through, carefully pour off the liquid and refrigerate allowing the fat to separate, skim off and use as an au-jus.
