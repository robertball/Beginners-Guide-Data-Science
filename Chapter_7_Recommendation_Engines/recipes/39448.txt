Ingredients:
4 center cut pork chops
1/2 cup prepared mustard
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed chicken and rice soup

Directions:
Prepare the pork chops by coating both sides of each one with mustard. Dredge the coated chops in flour. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place pork chops into the hot oil, and cook until browned on both sides. Remove from pan, and discard any excess oil in the pan.
Return the chops to the pan, and reduce heat to low. Pour undiluted soup over the chops, making sure to put an ample amount of rice on each one. Cover, and cook on low for 30 minutes, or until pork is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. Baste the chops occasionally, and add water if necessary.

Description: 
This recipe has been a family favorite for 30 years!  I learned to prepare this from a neighbor who was from Germany, hence the name!  My hubby doesn't eat mustard but this is his all time favorite - be sure to try!
