1 (16 ounce) package fresh strawberries, pureed
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch

1/8 teaspoon salt

4 egg yolks, beaten

Directions:
Mix strawberry puree, sugar, cornstarch, lime zest, lime juice, and salt in a bowl.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Remove from heat and stir in strawberry mixture until well combined. Add egg yolks, stir, and return to heat.
Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until strawberry curd coats the back of a spoon and is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
