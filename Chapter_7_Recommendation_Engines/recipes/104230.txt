Ingredients:
2 cups MortonÂ® Coarse Kosher Salt
2 cups sugar
2 1/2 gallons cool water
1 (12 pound) fresh, whole, bone-in skin-on turkey, rinsed and patted dry
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup white wine, chicken broth or water

Directions:
To Brine: Combine Morton(R) Kosher Salt and sugar in cool water in a large, clean stockpot until completely dissolved. Place the whole turkey in the brine until completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours. Remove the turkey from the brine, rinse inside and out under cool running water for several minutes to remove all traces of salt; pat dry with paper towel.
To Roast: Mix the softened butter with the pepper. Place turkey on rack in roasting pan. Rub the seasoned butter under the skin. Brush the skin with the melted butter. Pour the 1 cup liquid (wine, broth or water) over the pan bottom to prevent drippings from burning. Roast turkey at 450 degrees  F for 25 minutes, baste and then rotate the roasting pan. Continue roasting until the skin turns golden brown, an additional 25 minutes; baste again. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees  F; continue to roast, basting and rotating the pan once about halfway through cooking, until the *internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F for turkey breast meat and 180 degrees  F for turkey thigh meat. Remove the turkey from the oven. Let stand 20 minutes before carving.
