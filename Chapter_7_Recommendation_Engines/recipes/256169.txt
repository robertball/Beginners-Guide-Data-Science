Ingredients:
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian-style diced tomatoes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
4 cups diced potatoes
2 cups chopped onions
3 carrots, chopped
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, chopped
3 cups water
3 cubes chicken bouillon
2 cubes beef bouillon
1 (32 ounce) bottle tomato and clam juice cocktail (such as ClamatoÂ®)
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon thyme leaves
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaf
4 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams
1 cup skim milk
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Combine Italian-style tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, potatoes, onions, carrots, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, and jalapeno peppers in a large stockpot.
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in chicken bouillon and beef bouillon cubes until dissolved. Pour over tomato mixture in the stockpot.
Stir clam juice cocktail, sugar, thyme leaves, chili powder, garlic salt, black pepper, and bay leaf into the stockpot. Cook chowder, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are very tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.
Combine clams, milk, and flour in a separate saucepan; cook and stir over low heat until clams are heated through, about 7 minutes. Stir into the stockpot and simmer until flavors combine, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family recipe that we finally got my father-in-law to share. It can be easily adjusted for the kick that suits your taste. People can also add chopped jalapenos to their individual bowls if they want a zestier chowder.
