8 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 garlic cloves
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1/3 cup pine nuts, or to taste (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine basil leaves, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and garlic in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until basil is chopped. Add Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, salt, and pepper; pulse to combine.

Description: 
I grow basil in the summer and make pesto out of it to enjoy in appetizers, on pasta, etc! This basic pesto can be frozen and used in recipes year-round: just spoon it into an empty plastic ice cube tray, put the tray in a big freezer bag, and store in the freezer. Any time you need pesto, just pop out one of these pesto 'cubes' and let it thaw!
