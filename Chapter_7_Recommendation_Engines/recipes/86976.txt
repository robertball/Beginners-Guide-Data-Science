Ingredients:
5 pounds baby back pork ribs
1/2 gallon apple juice
1 head garlic, separated into cloves
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
2 cups barbeque sauce

Directions:
Prepare charcoal in a smoker, and bring the temperature to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
Cut the ribs into smaller portions of 3 or 4 ribs, and place them in a large pot. Pour in enough apple juice to cover. Place a lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, and let stand for 15 minutes.
Lightly oil the grate in your smoker. Place ribs on the grate, and throw a few cloves of garlic onto the hot coals. Close the smoker. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) by adding more charcoal as needed. Smoke the ribs for 7 hours, adding more garlic cloves to the coals occasionally.
Make a sauce by mixing together the barbeque sauce with 2 cups of the apple juice from the pot. Season with granulated garlic. Baste ribs with this sauce while continuing to cook for another 30 minutes.
