Description: 
These are a low-calorie, low-carb, but very tasty, light alternative to a tuna wrap sandwich! Try to choose larger leaves of lettuce with no tears or holes; lettuce leaves are replacing the tortilla in a traditional wrap sandwich. Cheese is optional, but even a little adds a lot of flavor.
