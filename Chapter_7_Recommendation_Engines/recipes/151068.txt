Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) beef brisket
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup Merlot wine
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup beef stock
1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 large onion, sliced into rings
2 stalks celery, with leaves
3 large carrots
4 large cloves garlic, diced
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons dried rosemary

Directions:
Season the beef brisket with salt and pepper and place into a shallow baking dish or large resealable bag. Combine the Merlot and balsamic vinegar; pour in with the steak. Seal or cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Arrange onion rings in the bottom of a roasting pan. Season with garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Pour the marinade into the bottom of the pan along with the beef stock and stewed tomatoes, and lay the roast on top of the onions so they form a roasting rack. Cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake for 3 hours in the preheated oven, then peel back the aluminum foil and add carrots and celery to the pan. Cover again and continue roasting for an addition 1 to 2 hours, or until the brisket can be pulled apart with a fork.

Description: 
I wanted to find a way to make beef brisket that wasn't a BBQ recipe but wasn't just plain beef either. This is what I came up with and my family LOVED it.
