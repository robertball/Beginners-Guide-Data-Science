Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cucumbers, peeled and sliced
1 cup cornmeal
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Line a plate with a paper towel; set aside.
Roll the cucumber slices in the cornmeal. Fry the slices in the hot oil, a few at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the cucumbers to the prepared plate; sprinkle with salt to serve.

Description: 
My husband isn't crazy about fried green tomatoes, but he loves these. This is a different and easy way to use up all the cucumbers in the garden! They can be dipped in ranch dressing, horseradish sauce, or salsa.
