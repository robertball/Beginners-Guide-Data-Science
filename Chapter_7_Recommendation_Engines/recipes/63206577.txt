1/2 a head of cabbage finely chopped
2 cups chopped Carrots
2 cups brocolli

1 Tbs Chinese 5 Spice
1 Tbs Garlic powder
1/2 Tbs pepper.

Directions:
Cook meat and drain. add veggies on medium high heat along with rest of ingredients except the wrappers.  cook down mixture until veggies are warm and getting soft. measure out  spoonfuls of mixture into corner of  wrapper, rub the other 2 edges with warm water with fingers and roll up, stopping a little past halfway and folding in corners first. Using a fryer, cook each eggroll until light brown all around, making sure they flip at least once in the cooking process. take out and put on paper towels to  remove excess oil.

Description: 
These are based on my moms recipe which she inherited while my father was in the navy from a Filipino wife on base, so they are loosely based on Lumpia.  But my friends rave about these. we have put them in the mini wonton wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers for fun at a party. but its a lot of work to wrap so many! We love to serve these with the La Choy sweet and sour sauce.
