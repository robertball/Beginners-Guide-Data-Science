Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks
6 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 pound boneless beef sirloin steak, cut into 1 inch cubes

Directions:
Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Refrigerate the pineapple. In a small bowl, combine the pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, oil, ginger, garlic and pepper. Reserve 1/3 cup marinade for basting and 1/3 cup for serving; cover and refrigerate.
Pour the remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add beef cubes. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade from beef. On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread beef and pineapple chunks. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes on each side or broil 4-6 in. from the heat until beef reaches desired doneness, basting frequently with one portion of reserved marinade. Serve with remaining marinade.
