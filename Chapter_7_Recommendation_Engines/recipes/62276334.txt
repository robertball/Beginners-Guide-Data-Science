2 fat carrots, or four skinny ones, chopped
2 celery stalks chopped
2 cloves of garlic minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon tumeric
1 teaspoon cumin

1  14 oz can chickpeas rinsed to remove salt
1  14 oz can cannelli beans rinsed to remove salt
2 cups red lentils (different color not recommended)
8 to 10 cups of water (More if needed)
2 tablespoons  Vinegar

Directions:
Saute' the onion, carrots, celery and garlic in the oil until soft. Add the oregano, tumeric, cumin and  bay leaf.  Stir.
Add the tomatoes, chickpeas, cannelli beans, lentils and water.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Stir the soup often! It will get thick as it cooks and could burn. Microwave the spinach, (if using), then add to the soup.
Just before serving add vinegar and remove bay leaf.
