Ingredients:
1 cup warm milk (1% used)
2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
2 Tbl sugar (natural FL crystals)
1 tsp salt (kosher)
2 Tbl oil or melted butter
3 cups bread flour, (used a tad less)

Directions:
In a large mixer bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm milk. Proof for 5-10 min.
Using beater attachment on power 1, stir in salt, olive oil and 1 cup of the flour.
Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Switch to dough hook when the dough starts coming together.
Knead on power 2 for about 7-8 min or until bowl is clean and dough is smooth but still tacky. It should keep it's ball shape.
Remove dough and lightly oil the bowl. Replace dough, turning to coat with oil.Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly oiled surface. Let rest for 10 min.
Pat into rectangle and fold to form a loaf (trifold sealing seams, and then tuck ends under and seal).
Place loaf into a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan with seam side down. Cover the loaf with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Reduce temp to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
