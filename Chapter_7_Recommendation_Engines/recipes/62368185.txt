Ingredients:
2 tsp. sesame oil or other cooking oil
2 cups sliced show peas
1 cup thinly sliced carrots
1 cup sliced mushrooms
3 cloves garlic
1/2 cup chopped green onion
2 Tbsp. soy sauce
2 cups leftover cooked noodles or rice
2 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Coat wok or skillet with oil.  Place over high heat 1 minute.
Add snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, garlic, and green onion.
Stir-fry over medium high heat until vegetables are crisp-tender (I like them more on the tender side).
Add soy sauce and cooked noodles/rice.  Cook 1-2 minutes or until heated through.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds before serving.
