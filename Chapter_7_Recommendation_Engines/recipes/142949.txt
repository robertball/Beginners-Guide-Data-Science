Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon curry powder
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 ½ quarts chicken broth
2 ½ pounds butternut squash, peeled and cubed
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter
½ cup light cream
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, curry powder, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the onion has turned translucent, 5 to 8  minutes.
Stir the chicken stock and squash into the onion mixture. Simmer the soup over medium heat until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, and stir in the nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and peanut butter. Transfer the mixture in batches to a blender or food processor; blend until smooth, slowly pouring in the cream. Reheat soup if necessary, but do not boil. Serve garnished with parsley.
