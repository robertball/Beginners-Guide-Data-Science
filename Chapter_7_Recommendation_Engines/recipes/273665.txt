Ingredients:
Filling:
4 Gala apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/16-inch slices
2 cups frozen wild blueberries
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Topping:
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup hard apple cider

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet.
Mix apples, blueberries, maple syrup, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, kosher salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Toss to thoroughly combine. Pour into the prepared skillet.
Stir maple syrup, melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt; stir until crumbly. Pour in cider and stir until just combined. Place dollops of batter over apple-berry mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuit topping is cooked through and fruit is bubbly, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was inspired by camping trips I used to take with my family when I was younger. Originally, this cobbler was made using huckleberries, and baked over a campfire; but since I no longer live in an area where I can get huckleberries and don't have a constant campfire going, I substituted frozen wild blueberries and baked it in the oven instead. I also use a homemade apple beer in the batter, but use whatever hard cider or fruity beer you like.
