Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
3/4 cup uncooked white rice
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup chopped pistachio nuts
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and cook onion, turmeric, and cardamom, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add rice and mix well.
Pour chicken broth into the saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 17 minutes.
Toast pistachios in a dry skillet until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes; remove from skillet and coarsely chop.
Place golden raisins in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak for 1 minute and drain well.
Remove rice from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Mix in pistachios, raisins, and green onions; season with salt.

Description: 
I usually make this Mediterranean pilaf whenever I want to change up our regular rice routine and my family loves it. It goes well with lamb or other meat dishes.
