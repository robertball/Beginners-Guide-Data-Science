Ingredients:
2 tablespoon oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
½ teaspoon of pepper
1 teaspoon of garlic powder
1 tablespoon cornstarch
11/2 pounds of ground turkey or lean ground beef
1 jar (1lb 10oz) Ragu mushroom sauce
1 pound grated mozzarella cheese
1 (10 oz) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 package of Ronzoni lasagna noodles

Directions:
Marinate the meat with garlic powder, pepper and cornstarch.
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onion and garlic; sauté 3 minutes.  Add more oil and put in the ground meat and cook until it is done.  Add the jar of Ragu sauce; simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Grease a 9 x 13" lasagna pan.  There are about 20 pieces of noodles in one package.  Layer 5 pieces of the cooked and drained noodles onto the bottom of the pan.  Divide the prepared meat sauce into 4 portions. Add a layer of cheese then a layer of meat sauce followed by another layer of cheese.  Then add the second layer of noodles.  Make sure all toppings are spread evenly across.
Continue the process until all ingredients are used up. ( Add the drained spinach to the top of any layer of sauce as desired)
Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake at 375 F for 45 minutes.
Remove the aluminum foil and bake at same temperature for another 10 minutes or until the top layer of cheese is golden brown.
