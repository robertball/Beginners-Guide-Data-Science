Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon fillets
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 lime, sliced
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup sriracha sauce
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with foil, grease lightly, and lay salmon on top. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Slide lime slices under the edges of the salmon.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in honey, sriracha sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, and garlic. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more.
Pour 2/3 of the sauce over the salmon. Use a spoon or spatula to make sure the sauce covers the salmon, leaving no dry spots. Fold up edges of the foil around the salmon to keep the sauce from spilling out.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Broil until the edges of the salmon start to char slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Watch carefully so the salmon doesn't burn.
Top salmon with remaining sauce and garnish with cilantro.
