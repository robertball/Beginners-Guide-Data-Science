Ingredients:
1 pound chicken tenders
salt and ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1  shallot, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
½ cup red wine
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
4  fresh figs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon honey
½ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides and lightly coat with flour, shaking off excess.
Heat olive oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to the skillet and cook until tenders are golden brown, no longer pink in the centers, and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.
Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add red wine and balsamic and let simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in figs, thyme, Dijon mustard, honey, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low or medium-low and let simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter.
Spoon sauce over warm chicken tenders, or add chicken back into the skillet to briefly reheat, and serve immediately.

Description: 
The balsamic vinegar is a nice contrast to the sweet figs which add great texture, and the thyme provides just a bit of savoriness to this sweet and rich sauce.
