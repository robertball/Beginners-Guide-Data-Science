Ingredients:
2 1/2 lbs Rhubarb, chopped
2 1/2 lbs Italian Prune Plums, remove pits and cut into pieces
3 cups sugar (4 cups if you like sweeter jam)
2/3 cup orange juice
1/3 cup water
2 - 4 t. orange zest (based on your preference)

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the rhubarb, plums, sugar, orange zest, orange juice and water. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium-low heat for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until thick. It will thicken more as it cools.
Ladle into hot sterile jars, and seal with lids and rings.  Also freezes well, just put in jars, cool and freeze.

Description: 
Rhubarb and Plums combine to make a delicious jam.  With an overabundance of plums I decided to tweak my Rhubarb Jam recipe (chollow in allrecipes.com) and the results were well received by my picky jam eaters.  Enjoy!
