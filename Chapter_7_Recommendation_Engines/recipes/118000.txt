Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar, divided
4 eggs, separated
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup sliced almonds
FILLING:
1 cup cold milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped

Directions:
Line two 9-in. round baking pans with waxed paper and grease the paper; set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Beat in egg yolks, milk and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Pour into prepared pans.
In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Spread evenly over batter, sealing edges to sides of pan.
Bake at 300 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with coconut and almonds. Bake 20-30 minutes longer or until meringue and coconut are lightly browned. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Cool meringue side up.
In a bowl, whisk milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes. Let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Fold in whipped cream. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, meringue side up; spread with pudding mixture. Top with remaining cake. Chill overnight. Refrigerate leftovers.
