Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) butter
1 cup cocoa powder
1 ½ cups white sugar
½ cup brown sugar
½ cup gluten-free flour
1 pinch salt
4 large eggs
1 tbsp vanilla extract
Canola oil spray
Topping of your choice (Caramel honey, frosting, ice cream, be creative!)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in the cocoa powder and mix until well combined. Remove from heat, pour into a liquid measuring cup, and transfer to the freezer for about 5 minutes.
Combine the white sugar, brown sugar, gluten-free flour, and salt in a medium bowl.
Whisk together the dry ingredients.
Combine the eggs, vanilla extract, and chocolate sauce in a large bowl.
Whisk together the wet ingredients until well blended.
Slowly whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until smooth.
Spray the baking pans with a bit of canola oil.
Evenly divide the brownie batter between the two pans.
Bake for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.
Top the brownies with your favorite topping or enjoy them just the way they are!
