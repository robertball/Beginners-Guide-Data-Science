Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tsp. vanilla
2 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup cocoa
1/4 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
36-48 miniature chocolate cups of your choice-peanut butter, mint or caramel (Reese's or similar brand)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line mini muffin tin(s) with paper liners or grease tin.
Combine sugar, butter and vanilla in large bowl.
Add eggs, mixing well.
In a small bowl, mix together dry ingredients-flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.
Gradually add dry ingredient mixture to egg mixture, beating until well combined.
Place about a tablespoon of brownie batter in the bottom of each liner.
Remove paper from miniature chocolate cup and place one on top of batter in each liner.
Add another tablespoon or so of brownie batter to each muffin liner until chocolate cup is covered.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, checking doneness at the end of 15 minutes.
Brownie muffins are done when they start to pull away from sides of muffin tin or when toothpick inserted towards side comes out clean (do not prick center as the cup will be gooey and toothpick will never come out clean).
Cool on wire rack before removing from pan.
