In a saucepan over low heat melt the butter with the cream, sugar and corn syrup. Add nuts and flour and bring mixture to a boil. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto buttered cookie sheets.

Description: 
You won't believe how good these are! The tricky part is finding the perfect time to remove them from the sheets without tearing them. It takes awhile to perfect this, but you can eat the mistakes in the meantime!
