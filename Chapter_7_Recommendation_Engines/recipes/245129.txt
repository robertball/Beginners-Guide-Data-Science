Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 Japanese eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted tomatoes (such as Hunt'sÂ®)
1/3 cup red wine
1 1/2 tablespoons capers
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute eggplant, onion, and garlic until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes, red wine, and capers and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Mix oregano, cinnamon, allspice, cocoa powder, sugar, and bay leaf into eggplant mixture; simmer until thickened, 30 minutes. Add a few tablespoons water if mixture becomes too thick. Remove bay leaf.
