Description: 
Boursin is a french herbed cheese used to spread on crackers for an appetizer, stuffed into chicken breasts which are breaded and fried off/then baked, spread on crusty bread with turkey, cheese, cranberry sauce and cooked  in pannini press, and many other applications.  It is usually found in the gourmet cheese case at the grocery store and can be pricey.  This is much more economical and really just as good or better.
