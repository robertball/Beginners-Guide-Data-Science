Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 pounds beef top sirloin, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 ribs celery, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
4 cups water
2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
1 (14 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 potatoes, cut into bite-sized pieces
10 baby carrots, chopped
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 small bay leaves
1 cup frozen corn
1 cup frozen green beans
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch over over medium-high heat. Saute beef in hot oil until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove browned beef with a slotted spoon to a plate, retaining beef drippings in the Dutch oven.
Saute celery and onion in the beef drippings until tender, about 5 minutes. Return beef to the Dutch oven; add water, beef broth, petite diced tomatoes, diced tomatoes, potatoes, baby carrots, garlic powder, and bay leaves.
Place a cover on the Dutch oven, bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, remove cover from the pot, and simmer the mixture until thick, about 45 minutes.
Stir frozen corn, frozen green beans, and hot pepper sauce into the mixture in the pot. Place cover on the pot and cook at a simmer until the corn and green beans are just cooked through, about 30 minutes.
