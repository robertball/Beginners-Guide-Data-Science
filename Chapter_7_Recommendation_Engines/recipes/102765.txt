Ingredients:
½ cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon ground sage
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 cup chopped Vidalia onion
2 cups sliced mushrooms or baby bellas
6 (3 ounce) venison tenderloin steaks
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
¾ cup sherry
¼ cup water

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup flour, sage, salt, and pepper in a resealable bag, set aside.  Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large pan over medium heat.  Stir in onion and cook until almost soft.  Add mushrooms, and continue cooking until soft.  Remove from pan.
Turn heat to medium-high and melt 2 tablespoons of butter in pan.  Toss the venison steaks in the seasoned flour and shake off the excess.  Sear venison in butter for 6 to 7 minutes per side and remove.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter.  Whisk in 1 tablespoon of flour, followed by the sherry and water.  Return the vegetables and meat to the pan.  Increase heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe after my father-in-law gave us a bunch of deer meat. It covers the gamey flavor, so if you aren't into gaminess this recipe is perfect for you. Plus, it's fancy enough to serve to guests.
