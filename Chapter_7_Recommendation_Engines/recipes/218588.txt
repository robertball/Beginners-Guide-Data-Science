Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
3/4 pound mild sage-flavored breakfast sausage
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, shredded
5 tablespoons dry onion soup mix
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups barbeque sauce
1 cup rolled oats, or more if desired
6 slices bacon, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix the ground beef, sausage, onion, carrots, onion soup mix, brown sugar, eggs, and barbeque sauce together in a large mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in enough oats to make the mixture hold together -- you can use up to 2 cups of oats. Divide the mixture in half, and spoon into 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. Place 3 strips of bacon the long way onto each loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until the meatloaf is no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 1 hour.
