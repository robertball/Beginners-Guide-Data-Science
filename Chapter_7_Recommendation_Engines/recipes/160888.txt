Description: 
An exquisite after-dinner cocktail. Potent and spicy notes going down with a nice long, cooling dark chocolate finish. Styled after some Mexican chocolate cupcakes I adore, and the more traditional Mexican hot chocolate. The key to any great martini is good liquor, use the best you have and you won't be disappointed.
