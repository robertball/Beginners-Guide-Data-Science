Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 egg, beaten
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup non-fat milk
1/8 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt to taste. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.
Transfer the chops to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 10 minutes to brown bread crumbs. Remove from oven, cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
While baking, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk and white wine in a medium bowl. After the pork chops have baked for an hour, cover them with the soup mixture. Replace foil, and bake for another 30 minutes.

Description: 
I make this wonderful recipe all the time and found that it is a lot better to not pan fry the chops in oil. Baking makes it a lot better for you and still tastes great.Modified from: Baked Pork Chops I
