Ingredients:
1 cup softened butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chunks
6 slices* chopped, cooked maple bacon
(*I used 6, feel free to use less/more.)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
Cook  slices of bacon until slightly crispy in a cast iron skillet (this is just what I prefer - if you don't have one, it's fine) and set aside.
Mix butter, sugar, vanilla and eggs until fluffy. Stir in flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Mix in chocolate chips and bacon. Spoon drop onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before transferring to cooling racks.
