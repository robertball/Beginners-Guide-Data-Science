Ingredients:
Ingredients
1 bunch (about 1 lb.) asparagus spears
1 dry pint (about 10 oz) sweet mini peppers
1 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tsp whole grain Dijon mustard (if gluten free look for a certified GF brand)
1 1/2 tsp white wine vinegar
Salt to taste
Nonstick cooking oil spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the tough ends off the asparagus spears, then slice them into 1-inch pieces.
Cut the stems off of the mini peppers, cut them in half lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds. Discard the seeds and stems.
Place the asparagus and peppers into a large mixing bowl with 1 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil. Toss the veggies until they are evenly coated with oil.
Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil spray, or lightly brush with olive oil. Spread the vegetables out on the baking sheet, making sure each vegetable piece is touching the sheet to ensure even roasting.
Place in the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, until the asparagus is tender and the peppers are soft, collapsing, and blackening in places. Remove from oven. Pour the roasted vegetables back into the mixing bowl and toss with 1 1/2 tsp whole grain Dijon mustard and 1 1/2 tsp white wine vinegar. Add salt to taste.
Medley can be served as a warm side dish, at room temperature, or chilled depending on preference.
