Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 (3 ounce) cans tuna, drained
7 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/4 cup shredded processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®)
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
2 tablespoons minced onion
3 tablespoons chopped pimiento-stuffed olives
6 hamburger buns

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water. Peel and chop eggs.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the chopped eggs together with tuna, mayonnaise, processed cheese, relish, onion, and olives in a mixing bowl. Divide the tuna mixture among the bun bottoms, then replace the bun tops.
Wrap each sandwich individually in aluminum foil and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the tuna salad has heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.
