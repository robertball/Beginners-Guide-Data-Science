Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust pastry
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
2 cups half-and-half
1/4 cup unsulfured molasses
4 egg yolks
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan and prick bottom and sides with a fork.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
Set a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl.
Whisk brown sugar, white sugar, cornstarch, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and allspice together in a saucepan; gradually whisk in half-and-half and molasses until smooth. Whisk egg yolks into molasses mixture.
Cook molasses mixture, whisking constantly, over medium heat until large bubbles appear on surface, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute more. Remove saucepan from heat and pour filling through sieve. Whisk butter into filling until smooth.
Pour filling into pie crust, place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling, and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.
Lightly beat cream in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Top each pie slice with a heaping tablespoon of whipped cream.
