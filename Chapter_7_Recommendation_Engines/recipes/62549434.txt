Ingredients:
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups chopped pitted dates, (8 ounces)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups toasted rice cereal, such as Rice Krispies
1 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
1.Combine butter, sugar and dates in a large saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter is melted, the sugar is no longer white and the dates are mostly melted, 8 to 15 minutes. The mixture should be a shiny, brown sticky mass. Remove from the heat.
2.Add salt, vanilla, cereal and coconut; stir well to combine.
3.When cool enough to handle, squeeze and roll the mixture into 1-inch balls. Place on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate until chilled.

Description: 
Really easy to make and taste just great. I used splenda instead of regular sugar. As for the comment of how to make them stay softer I would say eat them quicker.
