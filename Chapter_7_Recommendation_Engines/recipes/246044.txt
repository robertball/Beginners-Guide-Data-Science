Ingredients:
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1/2 lemon, juiced, or more as needed
1 sprig fresh mint, chopped
1 sprig fresh sage, chopped
1 sprig fresh thyme, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 1/2 ounces pine nuts
4 whole trout, sliced horizontally creating a pocket for filling
1 small onion, sliced
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
Combine olive oil, lemon juice, mint, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper in a bowl; let marinate at least 2 hours. Blend oil mixture with the pine nuts using a blender or mortar and pestle until you have a creamy mixture. If the mixture is too dry, add more oil and lemon juice.
Preheat oven to 335 degrees F (170 degrees C).
Place trout on a baking sheet and stuff with the herb-pine nut mixture. Sprinkle onion, more oil, salt, and pepper on the outside of the trout.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 40 minutes. Pour white wine over trout and let it simmer in the hot pan.
