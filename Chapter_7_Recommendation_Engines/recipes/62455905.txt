Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
6 bone-in chicken thighs (I remove the skin, but that's up to you)
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
2 small onions, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1- 8oz. package sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup red or white wine or chicken broth
1- 14-1/2oz. can stewed tomatoes
1- 8oz. can tomato sauce

Directions:
Combine flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and garlic powder.
Dredge chicken in the flour mixture, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in large skillet.
Add chicken and cook until nicely browned on both sides; transfer to a 13x9 baking dish that has been coated with non-stick cooking spray.
Add onions and garlic to pan and saute untill they begin to soften.
Add mushrooms to pan and saute until softened.
Add wine or broth and cook until liquid has evaporated (about 5 mins. or so).
Stir in stewed tomatoes (with liquid), tomato sauce and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt.
Simmer 1-2 minutes.
If the sauce seems too thick, you can add some extra wine or chicken broth.
Pour mixture evenly over chicken.
Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees about 45 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.

Description: 
This was inspired by a lonely can of stewed tomatoes that were in the pantry. This is simple to make and sooooo good! I love to serve this with mashed potatoes, but it also goes great with rice or pasta. We like it just as is, but feel free to 'spice it up' any way you wish. Enjoy!
