Ingredients:
1 box of vanilla cake mix
Food coloring
coconut
jelly beans
colored twizlers or colored pipe cleaners.
sprinkles; rainbow and festive
pudding box
icing

Directions:
Follow the directions on how to prepare the cake mix. Add about 1/4 cup of sprinkles into the batter. This adds a fun surprise. Next empty the pudding box into the cake batter. This makes the cupcakes more moist. Bake the cupcakes according to box instructions. Once cupcakes have cooled from baking, ice the cupcakes. You can add drops of food coloring to the icing to change the color. Next, grab the coconut and put 1/2 cup of it into a bowl.Add 1 drop of desired color to coconut and stir. Once the coconut has reached desired color, place it on top of the icing on the cupcake. This is the Easter grass for the basket. Place colored jellybeans on top of the coconut to resemble Easter eggs. Finally you can add festive sprinkles for a cutesy look. For the finishing touch, take the twizzler and pull all the strings apart. (Or use pipe cleaners)Then take one string and poke it into one far side of the cupcake; repeat on the other side. This is the basket handle. Serve these at an Easter party or to your family! They are sure to be enjoyed!
