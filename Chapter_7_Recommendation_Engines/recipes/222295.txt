Description: 
This is a deliciously cool French traditional summer cocktail that always wows my guests. But be warned, it goes down a little too easily! Make a large punch-bowlful for a large gathering, or a jugful for your family barbecue. It suits every occasion! Here in Mediterranean France, it's often served at summer garden parties.
