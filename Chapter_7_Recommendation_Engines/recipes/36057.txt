Ingredients:
Â¼ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons coarse-grained Dijon mustard
6 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper. Add chicken wings, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Preheat grill for high heat. Drain marinade from chicken into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside for basting.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill wings for 10 to 15 minutes, or until juices run clear. Turn frequently and baste with the marinade during the last 5 minutes.
