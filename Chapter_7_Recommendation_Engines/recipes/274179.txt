Description: 
This is a rich, sweet, and savory breakfast or brunch dish. The sweetness of the peaches complements the creamy textures of cream cheese and eggs. Using a full-bodied bread like brioche will add even more flavor to this meal, but anything nice and thick is recommended. Top with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and orange zest.
