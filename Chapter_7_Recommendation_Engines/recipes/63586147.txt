Ingredients:
1 cup plus 2 T. warm water
1/3 cup oil
2 T. yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1 egg
3 1/2 cups bread flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In your mixer bowl combine the water, oil, yeast, and sugar, and allow it to rest for 15 minutes.
Using your dough hook, mix in the salt, egg, and flour. Knead with hook until incorporated and dough is soft and smooth. (Just a few minutes.)
Form dough into 12 balls and then place in a greased 9 x 13 pan and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees or until brown.
