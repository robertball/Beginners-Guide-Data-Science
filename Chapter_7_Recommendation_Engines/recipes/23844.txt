Ingredients:
1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1/2 pound sliced mushrooms
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
3 tablespoons Italian seasoning

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Drain diced tomatoes, reserving 2 tablespoons of the liquid. Microwave onion, garlic and mushrooms, and reserved liquid in a large, loosely covered dish for 2 to 3 minutes until onions are clear.
Add tomato sauce, Italian seasoning and tomatoes to onion mixture and microwave 5 to 6 minutes more or until heated through.  Pour over cooked pasta.

Description: 
This is a fat-free, sugar-free variation on a recipe I use a lot. If you're not hell-bent on making it totally fat-free, I recommend cooking the onions and mushrooms and garlic in olive oil. Serve with fat-free Parmesan cheese and, if desired, hot sauce.
