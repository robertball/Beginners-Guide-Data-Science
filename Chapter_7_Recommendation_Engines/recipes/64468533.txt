Ingredients:
1 oz (4 squares) unsweetened baking chocolate
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter
2 cups sugar
3 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwavable bowl on high two minutes or until butter is melted.   Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Stir in sugar.  Blend in eggs and vanilla. Add flour; mix well. Refrigerate 15 minutes or until dough is easy to handle.
Shape dough into 1 inch balls; place 2 inches apart on greased baking sheet.
Bake eight minutes or just until set (do not overbake).  Let stand on baking sheet one minute transfer to wire racks and cool completely.
Feel free to spice these little guys up with toppings right after they come out of the oven! Press walnuts, mini-marshmallows, caramels, pieces of fresh kale or drizzle with chocolate.
