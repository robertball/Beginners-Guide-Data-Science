Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp peanut oil
1 onion, diced
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1 small package fresh or frozen shelled garden peas (approximately 200g)
1/2 cup chopped fresh pineapple chunks (optional)
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups cooked rice (better to use refrigerated rice instead of freshly cooked rice)
1/3 cup soy sauce
peanut oil
sesame oil
salt to taste
Sweet chili sauce (optional garnish)

Directions:
Heat olive oil and peanut oil over medium high heat.  Sautee onions, carrots, and celery.  Add additional olive and peanut oil as needed to keep vegetables from drying out.  Cook until vegetables are soft and onions are clear.
Add peas (and optional pineapple) and cook for another 1-2 minutes until they are heated through (slightly al dente).
Move vegetables to side of pan or place into a separate bowl.  Cook scrambled eggs until they are slightly moist.  Stir in vegetables and chop up eggs into small pieces using the spoon.
Slowly add rice and soy sauce to vegetable egg mixture.  Add a bit more peanut oil and/or sesame oil (to keep moist) and cook until all ingredients are heated through.
Serve with soy sauce and sweet chili sauce.
