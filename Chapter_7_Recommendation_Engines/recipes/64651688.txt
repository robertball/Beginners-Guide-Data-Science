Ingredients:
2 medium fresh beets
1 large potato (yellow or purple)
1 large sweet potato
2 parsnips

1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 or more garlic powder
1 teaspoon or more of your favorite dried herbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper (just for easy clean up).
Peel vegetable then thinly slice using a mandolin or sharp knife then place in a large bowl.
Drizzle in oil then sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic powder and any of your favorite dried herbs.  Toss together.
Arrange in a single layer on your prepared baking sheets and bake for 17-25 minutes; flipping and turning once.
Place them all in a serving bowl and enjoy.  Taste one first as you may want to add a little extra salt while they are hot!

Description: 
I just love these chips!  Not to mention the bowl is absolutely beautiful and what a great way to get your kids to eat vegetables!

I love using my mandolin for these chips but you can also use a sharp chefs knife. You may want to rinse the beets and maybe even wear gloves.
