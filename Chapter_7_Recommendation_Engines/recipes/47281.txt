Ingredients:
Crust:
1/2 cup ground blanched almonds
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
1 egg, lightly beaten
Filling:
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
2 tablespoons orange liqueur
1 teaspoon grated orange zest

Directions:
Combine almonds, flour and sugar in bowl of food processor.  Scatter butter on top and process just until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Add egg and process just until dough gathers in a ball.  Divide dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and shape into flattened discs.  Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Combine cherry pie filling, liqueur and orange zest.
Roll out the larger disc of pastry into 11-inch circle and place in 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom; trim edges.  Roll out smaller disc of pastry into 10-inch circle; cut into 10 3/4-inch wide strips for lattice top.
Spoon filling into tart pan.  Arrange strips in lattice pattern on top of filling.  Trim to fit and gently press ends into pastry shell.  Bake until pastry is golden brown, 40-45 minutes.  Cool on wire rack 10-20 minutes.  Remove side of pan and let cool completely.  Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
