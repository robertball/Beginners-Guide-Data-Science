Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine margarine, water and cocoa. Bring to a boil, and remove from heat. Combine the flour and 2 cups sugar; stir into the cocoa mixture until well blended, then stir in the eggs, sour cream, baking soda and salt. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar until smooth. Spoon the cream cheese mixture over  the batter in the pan. Swirl with a knife for a marbled effect. Sprinkle with chocolate chips.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until brownies start to pull away from the sides. Cool and cut into bars.
