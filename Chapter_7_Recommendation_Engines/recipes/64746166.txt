Ingredients:
4lb bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (i use 5x thighs and 5x drum sticks)
1/2 cup pimiento (allspice) berries
2 tbsp ground allspice
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
6-10 garlic cloves (to taste)
1 1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger, chopped
6 sprigs of thyme
1-5 scotch bonnet peppers, seeded (or habenero, adjust the amount according to taste & use gloves when handling)
8 green onions, roughly chopped/tips removed
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 cup soy sauce or maggi sauce
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar

Directions:
In a food processor, begin pulsing 1/2 cup allspice berries for about one minute. add in the other marinade ingredients (sans the chicken) and mix until pretty smooth (another 1-2 minutes). Reserve 1/3 cup marinade in a separate container and store in the refrigerator. Pour the rest of the marinade into a plastic bag or air tight container with chicken and marinade in fridge for at least 4 hours (or overnight), flipping once and ensuring marinade is distributed throughout. Once done, strain and discard marinade.
Pre-heat coals in a grill to 250-275 degrees (F). No more than 300 degrees. Coat grates in a bit of vegetable oil so the food doesnt stick.
Sear chicken (skin side) for 5 minutes over direct heat, uncovered.
Flip chicken and move to indirect heat for 25 minutes. cover grill.
Flip chicken, baste or brush with reserved marinade, and move to indirect heat for 25 minutes. cover grill.
Flip chicken, baste or brush with reserved marinade, and move to indirect heat for 10-30 minutes. cover grill. Monitor. Go to next step when they're juuuuust about done.
Finish with a quick sear (skin side down over direct heat) for a minute or two once they're almost done. If they're already done, dont sear.
If some appear done before the others, place them on a cooling rack.
