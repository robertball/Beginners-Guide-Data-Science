Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
8 large tomatoes, peeled and cut into big chunks
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup red wine
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon fennel seed
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes; add tomatoes, garlic, and bay leaf. Bring the liquid from the tomatoes to a boil, reduce to medium-low, and simmer mixture until tomatoes are softened, about 30 minutes.
Stir red wine, honey, basil, oregano, marjoram, salt, black pepper, fennel seed, and crushed red pepper into the tomato mixture; bring again to a simmer and cook until herbs have flavored the sauce, about 30 minutes more.
Stir balsamic vinegar into the sauce.

Description: 
A rich, flavorful sauce that is healthy. Great for use in pasta, lasagna, and other casseroles. My favorite way to eat it is to pour over raw zucchini 'pasta' for an extra-fresh and tasty meal that's very healthy, too! A great recipe for using up extra-ripe tomatoes from your garden. Double the batch and freeze half; it freezes well.
