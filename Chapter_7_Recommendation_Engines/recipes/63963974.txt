Ingredients:
2 c. all-purpose flour
1 T. baking powder
1/2 t. baking soda
1 t. salt
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, frozen
3/4-1 c. cold, well-shaken buttermilk
1 large egg
1/4 c. whole milk yogurt, sour cream, or creme fraiche
melted butter for brushing tops after baking

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment, set aside.
Mix all the dry ingredients together and then grate the frozen butter into the bowl with the dry mix. Set bowl in freezer while preparing the wet ingredients.
Whisk 3/4 cup of buttermilk, egg, and 1/4 cup of yogurt, sour cream or creme fraiche together in a small bowl. Set aside remaining buttermilk.
Get flour mixture from freezer and gently combine butter with the flour. Add buttermilk mixture and GENTLY mix until just combined. Lightly knead until it becomes a solid mass and if you need to add remaining buttermilk, so that the mixture isn't dry, do so in little bits and dribbles.
Dump out mass onto a floured counter and pat out into a rectangle about 3/4 of an inch thick. Fold like a letter (thirds) and pat out again. Repeat at least one more time (you don't want to handle it TOO much because the dough will get tough). Be sure to flour your hands too cause the dough is sticky.
After final pat, cut biscuits out. Push STRAIGHT down. Don't twist. Place on baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Brush tops with melted butter.
