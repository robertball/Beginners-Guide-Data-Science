Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 cups rolled oats
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2	teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 sticks unsalted butter
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2	cup sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2	cup white chocolate chips
1 1/4 cups trail mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. In a medium bowl stir together the flour, oats, salt, baking soda and cinnamon.
In a mixer cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then add the vanilla. Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and trail mix until incorporated.
I use a small ice cream scoop to form uniform balls of dough. You can also just use a regular spoon and portion accordingly on a baking sheet lined with a silpat or have it lightly greased. Bake for about 12 to 14 minutes, don’t overbake. You want them very light brown. Cool on wire rack.

Description: 
I always seem to have this problem of excess food in my house. When trail mix sounds like a good idea to my daughter and then she gets sick of it….what do I do? COOKIES!!!!! 

These cookies can use whatever trail mix you prefer. Obviously, not any that is of the savory variety! Our favorite that we use has M&M’s, both peanut and plain, peanuts, walnuts and raisins. White chocolate chips round out the flavors in this super delicious cookie.
