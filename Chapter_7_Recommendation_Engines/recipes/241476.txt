Ingredients:
1 (29 ounce) can pear slices, drained and cut into bite-size pieces
1 (28 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained and cut into bite-size pieces with 1 cup liquid reserved
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
1 (4.6 ounce) package non-instant vanilla pudding mix

Directions:
Mix pears, peaches, and pineapple in a serving bowl.
Stir pudding mix into reserved liquid from the peaches in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until the pudding dissolves completely and the mixture is bubbling, about 5 minutes. Pour the pudding mixture over the fruit mixture and stir to coat.
Refrigerate salad until chilled completely, at least 20 minutes.
