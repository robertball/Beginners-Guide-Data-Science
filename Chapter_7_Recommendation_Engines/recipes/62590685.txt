once chops are covered both sides with seasoning
place into freezer bag flat spaced out takes about 10 min to put together
put in fridge for 15 to 20 min the longer they stay the hotter the cajun season will taste
when you cook them pre heat your grill on high take the chops out and place them on the hot grill and them turn down the heat to low cook for 3 to 5 min per side after the first flip i like to take alittle left over marinade and brush it on the top side while the  bottom cooks it help with the flavor and keeps them moist the time depends on the thickness of your pork chops
