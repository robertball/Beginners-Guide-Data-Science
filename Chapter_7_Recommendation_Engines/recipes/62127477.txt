Ingredients:
1 package Pillsbury refrigerated dinner rolls
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup Kuners red beans with chile spices
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Grease two muffin pans.
Separate dinner rolls.
Press each roll into a bowl shape that will fit inside a muffin pan.
Bake the rolls for 3-4 minutes.
In a bowl, mix the onion, beans, olives, and cheese until just blended. Set aside.
Remove the rolls from the oven.
Press a small container (eg jigger or Tupperware midget) into the center of each half-baked roll (to make room for the filling).
Spoon filling into the center of the rolls. Filling should heap over top of roll slightly.
Return the rolls to the oven and bake for 7-8 minutes longer. Remove when the rolls are browned and cheese is bubbling.
Let cool slightly and enjoy!
