Description: 
Got the recipe from my retired neighbor, and the taste is wonderful  The second-day leftovers can be layered with mashed potatoes/whatever, turkey slices, any cooked veggie with some of the remaining sauce on top and re-heated. You could use a larger slow cooker and double the recipe easily for company. Great with a boneless breast or rolled white and dark meat turkey.
