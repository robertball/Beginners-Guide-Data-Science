Description: 
Despite the high ranking, the reviews of A Very Popular BBQ Sauce scared me. But, it uses ingredients that were in my mom's BBQ sauce when I was a kid, so I used the proportions as a guide. The Very Popular Sauce recipe is too sweet for my liking, so I added about 1/4 c. more vinegar. I also substituted olive oil for the water. I didn't add paprika, salt, black pepper, or hot pepper sauce. I cooked it over medium heat for about 10 minutes, then put it in jar to let sit overnight. It tastes a whole lot like mom's did, although next time I'll cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.Modified from: A Very Popular BBQ Sauce
