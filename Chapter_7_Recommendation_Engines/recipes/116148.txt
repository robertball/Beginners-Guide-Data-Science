Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
8 bacon strips
1 medium onion, sliced
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Sprinkle chicken with salt and lemon-pepper. In a large skillet, cook chicken in oil for 13-15 minutes or until juices run clear; remove and keep warm.
In the same skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, remove to paper towels; drain, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings. In the drippings, saute the onion and brown sugar until onion is golden. Place two bacon strips on each chicken breast half; top with caramelized onions and cheese.

Description: 
After trying this delicious chicken dish in a restaurant, I decided to recreate it at home. Topped with bacon, caramelized onions and zippy shredded cheese, it comes together in no time with ingredients I usually have on hand. Plus, it cooks in one skillet, so its a cinch to clean up! -Brenda Carpenter, Warrensburg, Missouri
