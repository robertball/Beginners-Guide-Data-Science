Ingredients:
For koftas:
½ kg minced meat
1 tablespoon minced ginger
2 teaspoons minced garlic
4 green chillis
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/3 cup breadcrumbs
1 egg, beaten
Salt to taste
For gravy:
¼ cup cream
750 grams tomatoes, pureed
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ginger, minced
½ teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder
½ teaspoon ground fennel seed (saunf)
1 tablespoon kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
Salt to taste
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves, for garnish

Directions:
To make Koftas: Mix all the kofta ingredients gently using your hands. Make lime sized balls. Heat oil in a frying pan and shallow fry the koftas, turning frequently so they brown all over. Alternately, you can bake the koftas at 160C for 20 minutes, but you will not get a nice crust this way.
To make gravy: Heat oil in a deep sauce pan. Fry ginger, garlic, and spices. Add pureed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes on medium heat till tomatoes turn deep red. Add ½ cup water and kasoori methi. Add koftas and simmer 10 minutes. Now add cream. Cook a few more minutes. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.
