Ingredients:
250ml dairy-free cream, I used Oat cream
3 tbsps caster sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1- 1 1/2 T cornflour mixed with 1 1/2 T oat milk
try with agar
1-2 T granulated sugar
20 raspberries (opt)

Directions:
Mix the cornflour and oat milk together to form a smooth liquid, set aside.
Heat the oat cream with the sugar until the sugar has dissolved, then stir in the vanilla.
Next, stir in the cornflour mix and whisk until the cream has thickened to thick yogurt consistency.
Place 5 raspberries, if using, into each ramekin, then pour over the creamy mixture and place in the fridge to firm up.
Once set, sprinkle an even layer of granulated sugar over the top.
Caramelize with a blow torch or under the grill. Eat within an hour to make sure the caramel remains crispy.
