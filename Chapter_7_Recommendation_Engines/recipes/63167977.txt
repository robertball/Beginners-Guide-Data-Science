Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oatmeal
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup flax meal
1/2 cup wheat germ
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups buttermilk or 2 cups milk with 2 T vinegar
1 cup milk
1/2 cup applesauce
2 eggs
1/3 cup Stevia
1 t. cinnamon
1 t. vanilla
3 tablespoons chopped walnuts (optional)
2-3 bananas sliced in quarters

Directions:
Grind the oats in a blender or food processor until fine. In a large bowl, combine ground oats, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
In another bowl, combine buttermilk, milk, oil, egg, and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix wet ingredients into dry with a few swift strokes. Stir in nuts and bananas, if desired.
Lightly oil a skillet or griddle, and preheat it to medium heat. Ladle 1/3 cup of the batter onto the hot skillet; cook the pancakes for 2 to 4 minutes per side, or until brown.
