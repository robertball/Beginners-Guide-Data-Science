Hamburger or Hot Dog Buns (High Altitude) Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup butter or oil
1/3 cup mashed potato flakes
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 teaspoons instant (rapid rise) yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 egg

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat milk, water and butter until very warm, 120 to 130 degrees F (50 degrees C).
Stir potato flakes into liquid mixture and allow to absorb. Ensure temp does not fall below 120 degrees before pouring into flour mixture in next step. Reheat if needed to maintain temp of liquid but do not exceed 130 degrees.
Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 cup all purpose flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Mix milk mixture into flour mixture, and then mix in egg. Add 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour. Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. (2 minutes at slow speed with Kitchen Aid stand  mixer)
Shape into ball and place into a well oiled bowl, turning to cover all sides. Cover with plastic wrap or towel. Allow to rest 10 minutes.
Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking sheet. Flatten slightly.
Turn oven off, place an oven safe dish filled with near boiling water onto lower oven rack. Place unrisen rolls onto upper oven rack (this mimics a proof oven) and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes (may take longer at sea level) until double in size.
Remove rolls from oven and preheat to 420 degrees.
Bake rolls at 420 degrees F for 12 minutes, or until golden brown. (400 degrees if baking at sea level)
For Hot Dog Buns:  Shape each piece into a 6x4 inch rectangle. Starting with the longer side, roll up tightly, and pinch edges and ends to seal. Let rise about 20 to 25 minutes. Bake as above. These buns are pretty big. I usually make 16 instead of 12.
