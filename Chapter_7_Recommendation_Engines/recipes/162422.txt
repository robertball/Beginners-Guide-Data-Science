Ingredients:
8 ounces whole wheat linguine
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 (16 ounce) package frozen fully cooked salad shrimp, thawed
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 (14 ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained
1/2 cup sliced black olives
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shrimp, garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is lightly browned and shrimp is hot, about 5 minutes. Mix in the artichoke hearts, black olives, lemon juice and salt; cook until heated through. Toss with pasta in a serving dish and top with Parmesan cheese before serving.

This is a recipe I got from a friend that I modified for a little more kick, since my wife loves spicy food.
