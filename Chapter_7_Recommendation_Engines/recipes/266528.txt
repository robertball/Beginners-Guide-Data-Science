Ingredients:
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons lime juice
4 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or more to taste
4 teaspoons minced garlic
4 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (4 pound) chuck roast, or more to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup chicken broth
3 bay leaves

Directions:
Combine vinegar, lime juice, chipotle peppers in adobo, garlic, cumin, oregano, black pepper, salt, and cloves in a blender or food processor. Process on high until adobo sauce is smooth.
Trim most of the fat from the roast and cut meat into 3-inch chunks.
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add meat and cook on all sides until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer seared meat to a Dutch oven and pour adobo sauce on top. Pour in chicken broth and add bay leaves.
Bake in the preheated oven until very tender, about 6 hours.
Discard bay leaves. Shred meat in the juices using 2 forks. Return to the oven and cook 30 minutes more.

Description: 
I have always loved the barbacoa at ChipotleÂ® and tried to duplicate it at home. This is an excellent comfort food.  Wrap it in a tortilla with black beans, cheese, pico de gallo, and guacamole and it is heaven.
