Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter, melted
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
4 bananas, sliced
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 small pkg. of banana instant pudding

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (8 inch) pans. Combine butter and brown sugar, divide and spread evenly between the 2 pans. Sprinkle pecans evenly over both brown sugar mixtures, arrange banana slices evenly over each.
Prepare cake mix according to package instructions. Divide batter into the 2 pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Turn cakes upside down on a platter or plate, gently tap bottom and carefully remove pans, replacing caramel mixture that sticks to pan.

Description: 
Easy and yummy. Bananas, brown sugar and pecans are baked under a banana cake mix. The pans are then inverted so the bananas end up on top!Modified from: Banana Upside-Down Cake
