Ingredients:
3 pounds ripe red tomatoes

1 medium yellow onion, diced
1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro

Directions:
Roast tomatoes in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until they are soft, 10-15 minutes. Remove the tomatoes to a bowl. Blister the jalapenos in the skillet. Let cool slightly, then remove skins and seeds. Add to bowl. Add onion, cilantro, salt, garlic and pepper to bowl. Toss to combine. Put half the mixture in a blender container or bowl of food processor. Pulse until desired consistency. Repeat with remaining mixture.
