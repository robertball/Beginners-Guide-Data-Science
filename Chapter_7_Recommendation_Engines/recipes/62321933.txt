Ingredients:
6 TBS unsalted butter
1/2 cup of fresh sage leaves (chiffonade)
1 tsp gray salt
1- 25 oz pkg fresh or frozen cheese ravioli
Fresh grated Parmesan cheese for topping

Directions:
Boil ravioli according to package directions.
After you drop ravioli in boiling water, heat a skillet to medium high heat.
Add butter and melt slowly.
Turn heat up to high and add in sage leaves (they will spatter in the hot butter).
Butter will foam lightly and as foam subsides, the butter will turn a nutty brown, and the sage leaves will become crispy. (Do not leave the butter unattended over heat as it will burn)
Remove from heat and add salt.
Drain ravioli and add to brown butter sauce to coat.
Top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
