Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon olive oil
½ yellow onion, finely chopped
1 small shallot, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons fresh-squeezed lime juice
24 ounces low-sodium chicken broth
2 ½ chicken breasts, cooked and diced (unseasoned)
2 cans white (cannellini) beans
As garnish:
2 jalapeno peppers finely chopped, seeds & membranes removed
Fresh cilantro, large stems removed
Low-fat sour cream
2 limes

Directions:
Cook chicken (I use our counter top grill) until juices run clear (165 degrees internal temp). Do not over cook!
Add oil to pre-heated (medium/medium-low) large soup pot; add onion and sauté until translucent. Add garlic and shallot. Cook approximately 3 minutes (do not burn) until soft. Add cumin, coriander, oregano, broth and beans. Add lime juice and salt. Toss in cooked chicken. Simmer for 5 minutes while you prepare the soup bowls.
In large soup bowls, add jalapeno and cilantro to taste (I like a good tablespoon of jalapeno and about 2 tablespoons of cilantro leaves). Spoon soup over jalapeno and cilantro, top with a teaspoon of sour cream, a fresh sprig of cilantro and a squeeze of lime.
Enjoy with fresh-charred corn tortillas.
