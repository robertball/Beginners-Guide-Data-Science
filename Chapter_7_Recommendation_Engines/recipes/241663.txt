Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling or topping
1 package Duncan Hines® Red Velvet Premium Cake Mix
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
9 ounces white baking chocolate
12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
6 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
7 ounces flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 3 round 8-inch cake pans. Separate the cherries from the syrup by placing in a kitchen strainer over a bowl. Reserve 1/2 cup of the syrup.
In a large mixing bowl, add cake mix, buttermilk, 1/2 cup cherry syrup, 1/2 cup melted butter, eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Blend with an electric mixer until the batter is combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
Bake the cakes until they spring back when lightly pressed with your finger, 28-30 minutes.
Remove the pans from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely for 30 minutes.
Place the white chocolate in a small glass bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Remove from microwave and stir until smooth.
Place the cream cheese and 6 tablespoons butter in mixing bowl. Beat until well combined. Add the melted white chocolate, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 2 1/2 cups of the confectioners sugar. Blend on low speed until the sugar is incorporated. Add the additional sugar and blend until the frosting is fluffy.
To Frost: Place one cake layer on a serving platter and spread with frosting, top with cherries. Place the second layer on the first and frost. Place the 3rd cake layer on top and frost top and sides of cake. Sprinkle and gently press coconut over entire cake.

This is a moist, fruity Red Velvet cake that's pure heaven. Cherries and buttermilk are the secret add-in, and the homemade icing is a special treat. For a frosting shortcut, you can always use Duncan Hines Cream Cheese Frosting.
