Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/3 (10 ounce) package frozen blueberries
2 tablespoons low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1 tablespoon vodka
1/2 teaspoon maple extract
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine heavy cream, blueberries, sweetener, vodka, maple extract, xanthan gum and salt in a wide-mouth pint-sized jar. Using an immersion blender and an up and down motion, blend cream mixture for 60 to 75 seconds, or until cream has thickened and soft peaks have formed
Cover jar and place in the freezer, stirring every 30 to 40 minutes, until ice cream reaches an ideal consistency, 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
This easy to make creamy keto-friendly treat can be made at home without an ice cream maker! The light notes of blueberry and maple are just enough to satisfy your craving without going overboard on carbs. This ice cream won't freeze rock-hard like most no-churn ice creams can. The vodka is optional, however it really helps keep the ice cream scoopable, and you don't taste it!
