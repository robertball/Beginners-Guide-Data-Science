Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose biscuit baking mix
1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the biscuit mix into a bowl and lightly stir in the yogurt just until barely combined. Mixture will seem dry. Knead to mix a few times, but don't overknead. Roll the dough out lightly onto a floured work surface about 1/2-inch thick; cut into rounds with a biscuit cutter.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, about 8 minutes.
