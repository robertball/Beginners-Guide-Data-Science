Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 egg yolks
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup milk
2 egg whites
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour an 8 inch square pan.
Cream butter or margarine and 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy.  Add salt and vanilla.  Separate eggs and reserve the whites.   Add egg yolks to the sugar mixture; beat until creamy.
Combine 1 1/2 cups flour and baking powder; add alternately with milk to egg yolk mixture.  Coat berries with 1 tablespoon flour and add to batter.
In a separate bowl, beat whites until soft peaks form.  Add 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until stiff peaks form.  Fold egg whites into batter.  Pour into prepared pan.  Sprinkle top with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake for 50 minutes, or until cake tests done.
