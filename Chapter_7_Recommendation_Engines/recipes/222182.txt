Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon lemon pepper, or to taste
salt to taste
1 pound trout fillets
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons capers, drained
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place a serving platter into oven to warm.
Mix flour, lemon pepper, and salt in a shallow bowl and firmly press trout fillets into the seasoned flour to coat both sides; shake off excess. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat and pan-fry the fish in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Keep fillets warm on heated platter in oven.
Pour off all but a thin film of oil in the skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Pour white wine into skillet and dissolve brown bits of food in the wine. Stir lemon zest into wine and bring to a boil; cook until sauce reduces to about 2/3 cup, stirring often. Mix in lemon juice and capers and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 more minutes. Whisk butter into sauce.
Lay trout fillets in the sauce and turn to coat; serve on the warmed platter and garnish with parsley.
