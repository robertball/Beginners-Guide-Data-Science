Description: 
Chili is always a little bit of experimentation, a whole lot of flavor, and one of my absolute favorite dishes. There is always a little give and take but here is my honed recipe with the (staple) list of ingredients. Serve in a bowl on a cold night or even spread over white or brown rice sometimes. Always sprinkle generously with Cheddar cheese and crumbled tortilla chips and maybe a dollop of sour cream and enjoy!
