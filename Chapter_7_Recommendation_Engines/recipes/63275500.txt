Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. baking soda
6 TB. unsweetened cocoa
2 eggs
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 TB. vinegar
2 tsp. vanilla (I use double-strength vanilla)
1 cup water
1 cup brewed coffee
Icing:
4 TB. butter
4 TB. milk
1 tsp. vanilla
6 TB. unsweetened cocoa
pinch of salt
2 cups sifted powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Grease and flour a 9x13 pan. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and cocoa. In a second bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, vanilla, water, coffee and eggs. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix well. The batter will be thin.  Pour into the pan and bake at 350° until the cake is firm in the center and begins to pull away from pan, about 35 minutes.
Icing: Heat the butter and milk in a heavy-bottomed, medium saucepan. Remove from heat. Whisk in the cocoa, sugar, salt and vanilla. Whisk until smooth. Pour over the cake, spreading the icing to the edges, and let it cool.

Description: 
A wonderfully flavorful chocolate sheet cake.  Can be made with either regular unsweetened cocoa or dutch process, although in my office taste test, the regular cocoa version was preferred 2:1.  I myself prefer dutch process.
