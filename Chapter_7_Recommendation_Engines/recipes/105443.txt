Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons Dutch cocoa powder
1 3/4 cups flour
2 tablespoons flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Line a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan with parchment paper.  Set aside.
Place the butter, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, sugar, vanilla and salt in a medium mixing bowl.  Mix, using the paddle attachment of an electric mixer until the mixture is light and creamy (approx. 1-1 1/2 minutes).  Add cocoa powder and all the flour.  Mix until just blended.
Remove dough from bowl and form into a ball.  Place the ball of dough on the parchment lined pan.  Roll the dough into a rectangle approx. 6 1/2 inches wide by 11 inches long and 1/4 inch thick.  Pierce the surface of the dough with a fork all over.  This allows the air to escape during baking preventing air pockets from forming.
Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan after 10 minutes of baking.   Remove shortbread from oven after 20-25 minutes and immediately cut into 24 fingers or rectangles while the shortbread is still warm.  If allowed to cool, shortbread will not slice well.
