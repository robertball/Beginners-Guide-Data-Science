Description: 
I had a lot of chocolate chip cookies left over after Christmas, so I made this cake using the idea of a graham cracker cake. Putting everything into a food processor made it quick to make and clean up. It turned out to be a tasty treat topped with whipped cream. It is very moist and soft. Adding coconut or nuts gives it texture. Serve topped with whipped cream or dusted with powdered sugar.
