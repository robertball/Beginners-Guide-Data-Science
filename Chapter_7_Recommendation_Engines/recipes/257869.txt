Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup sorghum grain
5 quail eggs
1/2 teaspoon Sriracha salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons avocado oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon vinegar
4 ounces fresh buffalo mozzarella
4 fresh basil leaves
1 avocado, sliced
1 Kumato® tomato, diced
4 radishes, sliced

Directions:
Bring water and sorghum to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until sorghum is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour.
Place eggs in a saucepan and fill with water; boil for 4 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes.
Mix sorghum, Sriracha salt, and cumin together in a bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon avocado oil and vinegar over sorghum mixture and mix well; divide between 2 bowls.
Rinse quail eggs under cold water; peel and cut each egg in half. Set egg halves on top of sorghum mixture.
Shred mozzarella cheese using your hands; divide between the 2 bowls of sorghum. Tear basil leaves and sprinkle over mozzarella cheese. Divide avocado, tomato, and radishes between the bowls.
