Description: 
This is so simple and delicious!  I assemble everything the night before, and as soon as I get up in the morning (before coffee even!) I turn on the crock-pot for the 1 hour of cooking.  As I leave for work about 50 minutes later, I turn the cooker down to low, and it's done when I get home 9 hours later.  I serve this with mashed potatoes and broiled tomatoes for an easy weeknight meal.
