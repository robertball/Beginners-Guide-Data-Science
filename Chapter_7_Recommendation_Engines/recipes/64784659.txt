Ingredients:
8oz of your favorite pasta, cooked
1 chicken breast or approximately 1lb chicken
8oz bacon
4oz spinach (or more)
1/2 dry ranch packet
1 tbs Flour
1 cup Heavy Cream or whipping cream
1 cup Milk (I use 2%)
1/4 cup Grated Parmesan cheese
2 tbs Romano cheese
1/4 cup shredded, sliced Provolone cheese
Salt & pepper, to taste

Directions:
Pound chicken breast to approx 1/2 inch thick if using breast meat. Salt & pepper to taste.
Fry bacon until crisp in large skillet then remove to paper towels.
Cook chicken to just brown in bacon fat. Chicken should still be raw in the center.
Remove chicken to large bowl and add dry ranch mix and flour. Stir to coat.
Cook spinach in bacon fat until well wilted. Add spinach to chicken bowl mixture.
Add cream and milk to chicken bowl and mix until combined.
Place cooked pasta in 9 x 13 inch baking dish, add crumbled bacon and chicken mixture. Stir to combine.
Top with cheeses and cover with non-stick foil, then cook 20 min at 375 degrees.
Stir, replace foil and cook an additional 15 min.
Let stand 5 - 10 min to thicken sauce and serve.

Description: 
This a great make-ahead meal for next-day lunches and quick re-heat. Just add a little milk before you re-heat. This is NOT low fat so don't ding me in reviews for it, make something else!
