Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon, diced
2 bunches collard greens, trimmed and chopped
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep pot; cook and stir over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Cook and stir collard greens, onion, garlic, and sugar into the cooked bacon. Cover pot and let mixture steam until collard greens are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove cover, raise heat to high, and cook until liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes.
