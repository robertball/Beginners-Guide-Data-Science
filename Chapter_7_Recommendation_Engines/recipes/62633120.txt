Ingredients:
2 c TVP [Bob's Red Mill textured vegetable protein]
4 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 3/4 c boiling water
14 oz frozen firm tofu, thawed
4 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 c diced onion
6 cloves garlic [or to taste]
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 8 oz can tomato sauce
2 c water
1 10 oz can of Rotel diced tomato with green chilis
1 28 oz can diced tomatoes
2 tsp powdered cumin
2 tsp powdered oregano
2 tsp powdered paprika
1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp chili powder
2 Tbsp powdered cayenne pepper [more or less to taste]
1 tsp salt
3 Tbsp masa harina [or flour]
1/4 cup hot water

Directions:
Put the TVP in a quart bowl or larger, add the oil, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce and toss until well mixed. Add the boiling water, stir and cover til the water is absorbed.
Rinse the thawed tofu and press between two plates to get as much liquid out as possible. Then crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. You can crumble it to the consistency of ground beef. toss the crumbled tofu with the oil, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce until well covered.
Saute the onion and garlic until clear in the 2 Tbsp olive oil in a 4 1/2 qt soup pot.
Add the tofu and TVP and brown as you would hamburger, stirring constantly, scraping the bottom of the pot until hot and lightly browned.
Add the tomato sauce, water, diced tomatoes and Rotel. Stir until mixed. Add the dry ingredients [except masa] and stir until well blended. Simmer for 30 minutes stirring occasionally.
If you wish the chili to be thicker, stir the masa into the hot water and blend into the chili and simmer another 15 minutes.
Enjoy!

This is a tofu and TVP based chili that I have served to Texas chili lovers and they thought it was meat chili.
