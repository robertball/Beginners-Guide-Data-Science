Ingredients:
1 pork tenderloin (about 1 lb)
1/4 cup quinoa
2 tbsp olive oil or butter
1/2 onion chopped
2 cloves garlic chopped
1 small apple, peeled and then chopped or grated
1/4 cup raisins or other dried fruit
2 tbsp pine nuts or pumpkin seeds
4 mushrooms, chopped
Spash white wine
Dash cinnamon
Dash garam masala
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
In a small pot, combine quinoa and 1/2 cup of water and cover. Simmer on low for about 15 minutes.
Heat the olive oil or butter in a large pan. Add the onion, garlic, apple, pine nuts, raisins, and mushrooms. Sautee until the onion is transluscent. Add a splash of wine and then set aside. Once the quinoa has finished cooking combine with this mixture.
Slit the pork tenderloin about 3/4 the way through and lay flat. You may use a mallet or heavy rolling pin to pound the meat to 1/2 inch thickness. Season on both sides with cinnamon, garam masala, and salt and pepper.
Line the slit of the meat with the quinoa stuffing and roll the pork up tight. Using either toothpicks or butcher's twine, secure it shut.
Bake this fabulous-looking thing in the oven for about 35 minutes at 425 F. Allow to rest for 10 minutes covered with foil after cooking.

Description: 
I've been searching for stuffing recipes that don't use bread as I try and avoid gluten. This quinoa stuffing was my own solution- hopefully there are others who will enjoy it as much as I did.
