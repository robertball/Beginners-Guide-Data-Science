Ingredients:
1 cup (120g) white whole wheat flour
1 tsp cornstarch
¾ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt
1 ½ tbsp (21g) unsalted butter or coconut oil, melted and cooled slightly
1 large egg white, room temperature
1 ½ tsp vanilla extract
½ cup (96g) coconut sugar
3 tablespoons (60g) elderberry jam (or jelly)
Shredded coconut

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter, egg white, and vanilla. Stir in the coconut sugar. Add in the flour mixture, stirring until incorporated. Chill the cookie dough for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350°F, and line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
To prepare the filling, add the jam to a small bowl, and stir with a spoon until it’s smooth. (It should take a few minutes!)
Roll the cookie dough into 24 small spheres, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Using your index finger or thumb, make an indentation in the centre of each.
Put some shredded coconut on a plate and, one by one, brush each future cookie with coconut oil and roll in the shredded coconut so that it sticks to the outside. I used an actual cooking brush but your finger will work just as well.
Finally, fill each of the indents with jam and bake at 350°F for 8-10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before carefully transferring to a wire rack. (If the cookies stick to the baking sheet, slide a knife underneath each first!)
