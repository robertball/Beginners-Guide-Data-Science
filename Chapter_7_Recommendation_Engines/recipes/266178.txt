Ingredients:
2 pounds ground pork
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons fish sauce
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon water
wooden skewers, soaked in water

Directions:
Combine pork, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix together thoroughly. Dissolve baking powder in 1 tablespoon water and blend completely into the pork mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread a handful of the pork mixture through a skewer using lightly oiled hands. Shape meat into a 1-inch-thick sausage around the skewer. Repeat with the remaining pork and skewers.
Grill skewers, turning as needed, until browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Cut each sausage into bite-sized pieces before serving.

Description: 
Street-style garlicky Thai pork skewers with lots of sweet and savory umami flavor. These are excellent broiled or grilled and served over rice noodles with nuoc cham dipping sauce, on top of steamed rice with a fried egg, or in a sandwich with a slick of aoli and lots of fresh Thai herbs. Baking powder is traditional and gives the pork its signature bouncy texture.
