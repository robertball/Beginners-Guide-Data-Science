Ingredients:
1/2 medium yellow onion, halved
1 medium carrot, cut into thirds
1 celery stalk, cut into thirds
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 lemon, sliced (optional)
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
3 sprigs thyme or parsley
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, (about 8 ounces each)

Directions:
In a large, straight-sided skillet or pot, combine all ingredients except chicken; cover with water by 1/2 inch. Bring to a boil over high. Add chicken and return to a boil. Cook 3 minutes, then cover skillet and turn heat very, very low. Let stand until chicken is cooked through, about 15  minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove chicken from poaching liquid immediately.
