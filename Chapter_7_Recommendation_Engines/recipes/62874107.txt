Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
3 tbsp butter
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups water
................
3 eggs, beaten
2 1/2  cups milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup raisins
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place uncooked rice in a 3 quart saucepan, and add water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine beaten eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix well. Stir in rice and raisins.  Pour into a 8x8x2 inch or 9x9x2 inch baking dish.
Bake uncovered for 40 minutes; stir pudding and sprinkle with nutmeg. Note: I missed this part.  It was good. Bake additional 30 minutes or until a knife inserted halfway between the edge and the center comes out clean.

This rice pudding is lovely served warm. It has the appeal of homemade comfort food.  Serve with half and half and additional sugar if you need it sweeter.Modified from: Baked Rice Pudding
