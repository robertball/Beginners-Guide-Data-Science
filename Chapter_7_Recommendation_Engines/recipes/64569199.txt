Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dates, pitted
1 1/2 cups unsalted peanuts
1 cup chocolate chips
1/4 tsp salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place peanuts on a baking sheet and roast 8 minutes until fragrant.
Meanwhile soak dates 10 minutes in warm water while peanuts are roasting and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper.
In a food processor, add dates, peanuts and salt. Pulse several times to break up the ingredients.
Add 1/4 of the chocolate chips to the mixture then process until a clumpy mixture forms.
Transfer the mixture to the pan and press the mixture firmly into the pan filling all corners of the pan.
Melt the remaining 3/4 of cup of chocolate chips in a glass bowl over boiling water. Pour melted chocolate over the bars and use a baking spatula to spread it into an even layer over the bars.
Cover the bars and refrigerate 1-2 hours to set.
Remove, cut into 15 bars and devour!
