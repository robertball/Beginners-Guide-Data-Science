Ingredients:
Salt
1 lb spaghetti or your favorite pasta
3 Tbs EVOO
4 cloves of garlic
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 lemons, zested and juiced
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggieano
Handful of chopped parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt to cook the pasta. Drop the pasta. You will cook only until it is al dente. Save some of the hot pasta water.
Heat a large deep skillet over low heat. Add EVOO, chopped garlic and pepper flakes.
When the pasta has been cooking for about 5 minutes, add a ladle of the cooking water , lemon juice and cream to the garlic and oil. Raise heat a bit to bring sauce to a bubble.
Drain pasta when it is al dente. Add lemon zest and half of the cheese to the cream sauce. Season the sauce with salt and peppr to taste. Turn off the heat on the sauce and add the pasta to the sauce pan. Toss the pasta with the sauce a minute or two allowing it time to soak up the sauce.
Top with remaining cheese, parsley and basil.
