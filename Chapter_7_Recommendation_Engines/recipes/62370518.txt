Description: 
I combined several German Potato Salad recipes - just picked the stuff that sounded really good and put it all in one recipe. I think it would be awesome w/red potatoes, but all I had on hand were russet. I served for a BBQ with brats and sauerkraut. Really delicious!Modified from: German Potato Salad
