Ingredients:
12 vanilla wafers
2 8oz packages cream cheese softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
2 eggs

Directions:
Line muffin tin with foil liners.
Place one vanilla wafer in each liner.
Preheat oven to 325.
Mix cream cheese, vanilla and sugar on medium speed until well-blended.
Add eggs.  Mix well.
Pour over wafers filling 3/4 full.
Bake 25 minutes at 325.
Remove from pan when cool.
Chill.
Top with fruit, preserves, nuts or chocolate.  I like a small slice of kiwi fruit quartered and a wedge of canned mandarin oranges - the combination of orange and green looks very pleasing. Also use canned blueberries, cherries, etc.
Be creative!
