Ingredients:
1 cup minced broccoli, fresh only
2 cups portabella mushrooms, roughly cubed
15 oz can black beans, rinsed
1/2 cup red onion, minced
2 XL eggs, beaten
3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs
1 Tbl Montreal Steak Seasoning
1 Tbl Worcestershire
2 Tbl minced garlic
3/4 cup fresh grated Parmesan
Olive oil

Directions:
1. Process broccoli in a food processor until very finely chopped.
2. Add all other ingredients to the food processor and process until finely chopped but not entirely smooth (you want a little "meaty" texture).
5.Set aside while you place a medium non-stick pan over medium heat and add in 2 Tbl of oil.
6.Once the oil starts to shimmer (about a minute or two), using dampened hands (the mixture will stick to you if you don’t), scoop a 1/2 cup of mixture into the palm of your hand and gently shape into a burger all the while pressing together. The mixture should hold a burger shape. If it doesn’t add just a Tbl more of bread crumbs.
7.Place in the oil and cook for 3-5 minutes per side or until golden brown and a crust has formed on each side.
