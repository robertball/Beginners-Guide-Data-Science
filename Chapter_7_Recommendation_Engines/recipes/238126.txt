Ingredients:
¼ cup unsalted butter
2  bone-in skin-on chicken breasts
4  potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
4  carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds
3 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon fresh lemon thyme leaves
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAW<sup>&reg;</sup>Y'S(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the melted butter, skin-side down; cook chicken skin in hot butter until beginning to brown and crisped, about 5 minutes.
Flip chicken breasts. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and celery around the chicken.
Chop rosemary and lemon thyme together; sprinkle over the chicken and vegetables. Season everything with paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, white pepper, salt and black pepper.
Place a lid on the skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
