Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour (3.18 oz scoop and sweep method)
1/4 cup rice flour
2 tbs potato starch
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp sugar
2/3 tsp salt
1/4 tsp white pepper
1 cup cold water
1 egg
12 medium raw, peeled shrimp, patted dry, halved to make it thinner & lightly seasoned with salt
10 thin green onions, cut into 2? in length, white parts halved lengthwise (see notes)
2 medium carrots, super thinly sliced
2 red chilies, deseeded and sliced (optional)
Sauce:
1 tbs soy sauce (can sub with Tamari or Coconut aminos)
1 1/2 tsp rice vinegar
1/2  1 tsp water
1/8 tsp sugar (you can leave out)
1/2 tsp toasted sesame seeds
Couple drops sesame oil
1/8 tsp chili flakes (optional)

Directions:
1. Add a generous coat of oil to the bottom of a 10? cast iron pan. Turn the heat to medium to preheat the pan.
2. In a bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, rice flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar and salt.
3. Add the cold water to the dry mix, crack the egg and combine until smooth. Do not over mix or gluten may form and pancake will be tough. Batter consistency is similar to a thick crepe batter. If it feels runny, add another 1 tablespoon of flour. If it’s too thick, add a little more cold water.
4. Sprinkle some salt and all-purpose flour onto the carrots n green onions. Add the carrots and green onions to the batter and stir. Ratio of batter to vegetables: There should be some vegetables that can’t ‘fit’ in the batter. If you don’t like too much filling, that’s fine too. Add less vegetables.
5. When oil is almost smoking, pour half the batter in. If should be sizzling (Sizzling equals crispiness). Work quickly to spread the batter and vegetables to make sure they’re even and not too thick. Too thick of a pancake is difficult to cook through.
6. Top the pancake with 1/2 shrimp n 1/2 red chilies. Push down the shrimp so that it is snug in the batter (or else it will be difficult to evenly cook the batter when you flip later).
7. Fry for 3-4 minutes or until bottom is crisp and brown. Shrimp will start to turn a little pink and pancake would have almost set.
8. Carefully flip the pancake, swirl some oil, shake the pan so the oil reaches the bottom of the pancake. Using the spatula, gently but firmly press down pancake to make sure the bottom of the pancake is in contact with the hot pan. Fry for another 4-5 minutes. Carefully check to see if the shrimp and batter is cooked through. If it’s browning too quickly and pancake has not fully set, turn the heat to medium or slightly lower. Fry until it is cooked through.
9. Keep pancake in the oven at 200 F while you make the second batch.
10. Use a knife or a pizza cutter to slice the pancake. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
