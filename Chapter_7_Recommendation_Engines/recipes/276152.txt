Ingredients:
1/2 pound fresh okra
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and diced, or more to taste
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
8 fresh curry leaves
1 onion, diced, or to taste
1 green chile pepper, chopped, or to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground fenugreek
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Rinse okra and let dry completely before cutting into 1/4-inch thick wheel-shaped rounds, at least 10 minutes.
While okra is drying, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat in a skillet. Fry potatoes in the hot oil until nearly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
Heat remaining oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until beginning to brown, about 30 seconds. Add mustard seeds; cook until they start to pop, 15 to 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, followed by okra rounds. Stir-fry until okra is brown and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, chile pepper, garlic, and salt; fry until onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add turmeric and fenugreek; stir to coat evenly. Stir in cilantro. Serve.
