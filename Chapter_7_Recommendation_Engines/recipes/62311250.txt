Description: 
I had all this stuff in my refrigerator and decided to throw it all together for dinner one night.  I loved it!  The nice thing is, you can substitute just about anything you want or use different amounts to your taste.  I added the almonds for the crunch and the parsley for the freshness. Although the recipe is written for raw shrimp, I used cooked shrimp and threw that in at the last minute.
