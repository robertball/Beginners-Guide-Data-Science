Description: 
MY GRANDMOTHER would refer to this recipe as 'comfort food', made from ingredients available on the farm or staples found in her pantry.    She always cooked the corn bread in her 'seasoned' black skillet, and it turned out slick as butter every time. -Elizabeth Cooper, Madison, Alabama
