Stir in the reserved venison, then add tomato sauce, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Pour into a casserole dish, cover, and bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Description: 
A venison spin on a classic dish my mother used to make.  A wonderful dish. This is an oven dish, though a slow cooker or stovetop cooking can be done with this dish. It's wonderful served over rice or noodles.
