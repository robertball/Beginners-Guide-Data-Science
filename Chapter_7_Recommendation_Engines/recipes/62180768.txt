1/8 C Light Brown Sugar, Packed
4 T Garlic Powder
2 T Lowrys Season Salt

Mix all ingredients in bowl, rub on meat. Flavor is best if meat is able to sit in refriderator, after being rubbed for 24 hours, however if you're in a hurry you can let it sit for less time.

Description: 
I found a similar recipe on here and thought I'd alter it to suit my needs. I used it for 6 pork chops (I put the rub on REALLY heavy), so the recipe is small, but can easily be multiplied. It pairs great with my Lazy Day BBQ Sauce.
