Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 1/2 cups water, divided
1/4 medium onion, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup couscous
1 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Place drained spinach in a saucepan over medium heat and add 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Cover and cook about 5 minutes more. Set aside without draining.
Combine 1/2 cup water, onion, 1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes, adding more water if needed. Add cooked spinach and liquid, chickpeas, 1/2 cup water, salt, and pepper. Cook until liquid is reduced, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring 3/4 cup water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir couscous and 1 teaspoon curry powder into the water. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, about 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.
Plate 1 cup cooked couscous per serving, topped with 1/2 the spinach mixture.
