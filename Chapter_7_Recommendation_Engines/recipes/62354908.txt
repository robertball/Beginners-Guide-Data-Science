While the meat is browning combine remaining ingredients in crockpot. Stir well. Transfer meat to crockpot making sure to completely cover with sauce. Cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4 for hours.

Description: 
I'm not a fan of ground beef but I like the flavor of sloppy joes. This recipe incorporates the flavor of the classic sandwich with the lean cut of flank steak and the ease of a crockpot.
