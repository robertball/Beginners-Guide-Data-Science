Ingredients:
FOR CHICKEN:
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 T olive oil
1 T Chipolte Adobo sauce
Salt & pepper
FOR SALAD:
1 head Romaine lettuce
1/2 red onion, sliced and/or green onions
12 Kalamata olives, cut in half
3 Roma tomatoes, sliced and chunked
1 T lemon juice
1 T red wine vinegar
2 oz Feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400
Combine Chipolte Adobo sauce with olive oil and liberally brush on chicken.  Season with salt and pepper.
In oven proof skillet, sear chicken until nicely browned.
Transfer to oven and cook 10 to 15 minutes more or until internal temp of 165 reached.  Remove from oven, let cool, and cube or shred, which ever is ascetically pleasing to your eye.
*Optional:  I added a little chicken stock to the pan drippings, reduced a bit, and added that to the chicken.
In a bowl, add cooked and cubed chicken (along with drippings if using).  Stir in olives, onion, and tomatoes.
Add lemon juice and feta cheese.  Note:  if not using drippings, add an additional tablespoon of olive oil if desired.
Line a bowl or plate with lettuce and pile chicken mixture on top.  Serve.

Description: 
This is an adaptation of a recipe from the NY Times.  Considering there's less than 300 calories a serving, I have to love this.  The chicken itself is remarkably sweet and juicy.
