Ingredients:
15 ripe Roma tomatoes, diced
2 large jalapenos; diced (de-seed if prefer less heat)
3 habanero's; diced (de-seed if prefer less heat)
1 large white onion; diced
1 bunch of cilantro; chopped
1 large fresh lemon; juiced/squeezed
2 cloves garlic; minced
1 Tbsp. kosher salt

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl combine tomatoes and lemon juice.
Let rest/sit for 15 minutes.
Combine rest of ingredients with tomatoes and lemon juice and mix well.
Set aside 1/3rd of salsa mix in separate mixing bowl.
Place remainder of salsa mix in a blender or Cuisinart and pulse till a chunky/smooth consistency.
Mix both blended and reserved 1/3 chopped salsa back into large mixing bowl.
*note: You can serve immediately but I prefer to cover and refrigerate overnight to let flavors marinate. I divide into pint Mason jars to give as gifts and they store well in fridge for up to 2 weeks...if lasts that long at all.

Description: 
Everyone has a homemade hot salsa they are proud of and yes, here is another one. I know everyone can take the easy route and pick one up from a grocery chain but, there is something about homemade salsa. This recipe is simple and my friends always ask for some when I make. Being a Texan I like my salsa HOT with heat so, adjust accordingly and serve with lots-o-chips.
