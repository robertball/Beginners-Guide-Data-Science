Ingredients:
1 beef tongue
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place the tongue in a soup pot with the salt, and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until the outer skin begins to peel off, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Peel off the thick outer skin, and serve.

Description: 
My Mother use to boil the heck out of it, and then peel the very thick skin, and serve it up on a platter for Sunday dinner - mmmmmm! I can't believe now that all us kids used to fight over the tip, and the next day - tongue sandwich to school with lots of mayonnaise.
