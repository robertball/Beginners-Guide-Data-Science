Ingredients:
1/2 cup flaxseed
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup coconut oil
2 cups chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), divided
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine flaxseed, rolled oats, coconut, and almonds in the bowl of a food processor; process until it makes a nice powder mixture. Add coconut oil, 1/2 cup of chocolate-hazelnut spread, and vanilla extract; process until combined. Spread batter on a 9-inch square baking sheet and place in refrigerator to chill.
Meanwhile, place remaining 1 1/2 cups chocolate-hazelnut spread and chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute; remove and stir. Repeat microwaving at 1-minute intervals and stirring until chocolate chips have melted and mixture is nice and smooth.
Remove baking sheet from the refrigerator and pour melted chocolate mixture on top. Return to the refrigerator and chill for at least 25 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.
