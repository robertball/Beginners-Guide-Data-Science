Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup sweet potato puree
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup orange juice
4 egg whites
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons hot water
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter, sweet potato, white sugar, brown sugar, and orange juice with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs whites one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract. Dissolve baking soda in hot water in a small bowl. Add to sweet potato batter. Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I love these cookies but I really wanted to try to make them a little lighter. I actually used sweet potato puree for some of the butter and juice squeezed from an orange for some of the sugar and they still taste great. It sounds a little odd but try it!!
