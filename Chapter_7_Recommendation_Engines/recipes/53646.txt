Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 (10 ounce) can asparagus tips, drained
4 thick slices sourdough bread, lightly toasted
4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to upper position, and set oven to broil.  You may also use a toaster oven to cook the sandwiches if you don't want to broil them in the oven.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.
Place a few spears of asparagus on a slice of bread.  Top with 2 slices crisp bacon then a slice of cheese.
Toast under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Description: 
When I was a kid my sister and I LOVED when my mom made these.  We would always argue about the order the ingredients should go on the toast. (Of course, I'm submitting this in the order I liked.) It was also a good way to get us to eat asparagus.
