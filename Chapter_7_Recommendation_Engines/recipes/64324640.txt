Ingredients:
1 1/4 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 pounds beef, boneless round steak, well trimmed and cut into 1/2" pieces
1 medium onion(s)
1 1/2 medium carrot(s) cut crosswise into 1/2" thick rounds
1/2 can - 5 ounce(s) mushroom, white
1 1/4 clove(s) garlic
1/2 sprig(s) rosemary, fresh, plus additional cut-up sprigs for garnish
1/4 cup(s) wine, dry red
1/2 can - 14 ounce(s) tomatoes, diced, (1/2 can) with juice
1 tablespoon tomato paste
peppercorns, black Freshly Ground, To Taste
salt To taste

Directions:
In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add half the beef and cook until browned on the outside, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining beef.
Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions. Cook, scraping up any brown bits, until the onions are softened, about 3 minutes.
Add carrots, mushrooms, garlic, and rosemary stems. Continue to cook until the mushrooms start giving off their juice, about 3 minutes longer.
Pour the wine over the vegetables, stir well, and bring to a boil. Stir in the tomatoes and their juice, tomato paste, and 2 cups water. Return the beef to the pan and stir to combine.
Cover the pan, leaving the cover slightly ajar, and simmer the stew for 1 hour over medium-low heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste and continue to cook for 30 minutes longer or until the carrots and meat are tender. Remove the rosemary sprigs and discard. Serve the stew hot.
