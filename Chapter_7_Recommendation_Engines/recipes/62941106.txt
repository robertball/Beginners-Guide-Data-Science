Ingredients:
•4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
•4 ounces butter, room temperature
•1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
•1/4 cup granulated sugar
•1 large egg
•1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
•1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
•1/2 teaspoon baking powder
•1/4 teaspoon salt
•1 cup white chocolate chips
•2 key limes or 2 tablespoons fresh lime zest

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°. Grease a cookie sheet, or spray with nonstick cooking spray, or line with silicone liner.
Use a zester to zest the two limes.
In a mixing bowl with electric mixer, beat cream cheese, butter, and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Slowly beat in the flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold in white chocolate chips and lime zest.
Drop by teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet(s), leaving about 1 inch between cookies. These cookies spread very little. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes, or until the cookies are set and lightly browned around the edges.
Makes 2 1/2 to 3 dozen cookies.
