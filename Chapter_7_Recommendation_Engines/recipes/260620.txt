Description: 
My husband and I have been in the seafood business for 15 years. This a a recipe that we have on our market & cafe menu. It is easy and delicious! We recommend asking your local fish monger for 'fresh still lobsters.' These lobsters are fresh but not alive (recently deceased, to put it kindly). It is much less expensive for those that are land-locked. I serve this as a main course but for lunch or a snack I forgo the lettuce, tomato, & cheese and serve it open-faced on half a bun to lighten it up a bit.  Enjoy!
