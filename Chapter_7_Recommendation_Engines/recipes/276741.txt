1 cup butter, at room temperature
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar

8 drops green food coloring, or as desired (optional)
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cream butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer; add sugar and beat well. Mix in vanilla extract and food coloring. Slowly add flour and mix well to combine.
Fill a cookie press with dough and form cookies onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 8 to 10 minutes, making sure to remove at the first hint of browning.

Description: 
These cookies are a family tradition every Christmas in my family, especially in tree or wreath form! The cream cheese gives regular spritz cookies a nice little boost.
