Ingredients:
Martha White Cornbread Mix
6-8 Eggs
1 Bell Pepper
3 Ribs Celery
2 Onions
1 Whole Chicken
2 Cups Milk
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Night before:  Make Cornnread according to directions on package.  I always double the recipe for a 12 in. cast iron skillet. Use double the eggs called for.It is not necessary, but this is the way my grandmother did it.
Quarter Chicken and Boil with One large onion (quartered).  Once chicken is thouroughly cooked, removed chicken and allow to cool. Reserve stock.
Crumble cornbread into a large bowl.
Chop bell pepper, celery and onion, place vegetables in 2 cups of milk in a pot and over medium heat.  Allow milk to steam, which will soften the veggies.  Once Veggies are steamed, remove pot from fire and add to cornbread.
Remove chicken meat from the bones and add to cornbread as well.
Add 4 eggs to cornbread and mix.
Add chicken stock to cornbread until moist, or until you get the desired consistency. Usually about 4 cups give or take.
Use this dressing to stuff inside the turkey.  Place the remaining dressing into a large casserole dish and bake at 350 for about one hour, or until cooked/heated thouroughly.  I usually place in the oven with Turkey halfway though the bird's cooking time.
