Ingredients:
1 lb. shrimp, fresh or frozen
1 tsp. citrus grill seasoning, more or less to taste
3 Tbsp. butter
1/2 shallot, finely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 to 6 small tortillas, flour or corn
garnishes as desired (we like cilantro, cilantro-lime coleslaw and sour cream)

Directions:
Quick thaw the shrimp if frozen. Peel and devein the shrimp; sprinkle with some citrus grill seasoning and set aside.
Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat; add the shallot and garlic. Saute until the shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and saute until at least cooked through (We like to let it cook, untouched, for a few minutes so it almost browns to a crisp on each side). Add more seasoning if desired, and stir to cook in.
Warm the tortillas: either wrap in a towel and heat through in the microwave, or wrap in foil and heat in the oven for up to 10 minutes at about 350 F. Serve with desired garnishes: sour cream, cilantro-lime coleslaw, or crumbled cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and fruit salsa.

Description: 
We like the basic citrus shrimp taco filling because it requires almost no advance planning and is neither too spicy nor too fruity.
