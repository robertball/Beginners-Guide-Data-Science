Ingredients:
1/2 cup dates, pitted and chopped
2 1/2 cups ground almonds
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
1 pinch sea salt
6 ripe bananas
1/3 cup fruity olive oil
3 eggs, separated
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Place dates in a bowl and cover with hot water; soak until soft, about 20 minutes.
In the meantime, combine ground almonds, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; stir until combined. Mash 5 bananas in a large bowl; add remaining cinnamon and nutmeg. Reserve remaining banana.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
Mix olive oil into the bowl with the bananas using an electric mixer until fully incorporated. Beat in egg yolks one at a time. Add vanilla extract and continue whisking until combined.
Check dates for softness. Drain and transfer to a food processor; pulse until a paste forms. Add paste to banana mixture until fully incorporated.
Beat egg whites in a bowl until they form soft peaks. Fold into the bowl with the banana batter. Slice remaining banana into coins and fold in. Transfer batter to the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool 30 minutes before removing from pan and slicing.
