Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/3 cup milk
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup softened butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking dish. Whisk 1 cup flour, the baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl.
Beat the shortening and 1/2 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter into prepared pan, then sprinkle evenly with blueberries. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, cinnamon, and butter in a bowl with a fork until crumbly and evenly mixed. Sprinkle evenly over the blueberries.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the buckle comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Allow to cool before serving warm.

This is a traditional recipe from eastern Canada where blueberries grow wild and abundantly each summer.  This recipe combines all my favorite things... cake, berries and crumble topping!
