Ingredients:
5 chicken breast halves
1 (8 ounce) package pasta shells
1 cup reduced-calorie mayonnaise
1 cup fat-free plain yogurt
1 teaspoon curry powder, or more to taste
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen peas, thawed
4 radishes, sliced
2 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook chicken breasts in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Rinse chicken in cold water to cool, cut into small chunks, and refrigerate to cool completely.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shell pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain.
Stir mayonnaise, yogurt, and curry powder together in a large bowl. Add cold chicken, cold pasta, peas, radish slices, and green onion slices; stir to combine.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.

Description: 
Good for lunch or dinner, this warm-weather pasta salad is a complete meal when served over a bed of lettuce with a side of fresh sliced garden tomatoes and warm garlic breadsticks. I usually add more curry powder than the recipe calls for.
