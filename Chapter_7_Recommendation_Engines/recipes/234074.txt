Description: 
Beef, chili beans, and a special surprise ingredient give this chili a savory flavor unrivaled by other chilis. Serve topped with diced raw onion, sour cream, and shredded Cheddar cheese for a mouth-watering delight! Believe it or not, the secret is the ketchup (NOT catsup) that adds just the right flavor to the sauce; use more or less as desired. Use sauteed fresh mushrooms for a special treat! Seasonings may be added to taste. If you want it really hot, use hot chili beans and add more chili powder and cayenne pepper or include hot peppers!
