Ingredients:
1 loaf artisanal-style Italian bread, cut in half lengthwise
1 (4 ounce) package garlic cream cheese
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 1/2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend
1 cup finely crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place bread halves on a baking sheet.
Mix cream cheese and garlic together in a bowl. Spread over the bread in a thin layer. Sprinkle Italian cheese, Gorgonzola cheese, and Italian seasoning evenly over the 2 halves.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Turn on the broiler. Broil garlic bread until crisped and top is bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes.
Let cool for about 5 minutes before cutting garlic bread into individual slices.

Description: 
This recipe replaces the butter on traditional garlic bread with cream cheese, making it creamy and delicious! The blue cheese adds a sophisticated flair and pairs especially well with a nice grilled steak and green salad. This bread cooks up crisp on the outside while the topping keeps the inside moist and soft.
