Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
4 oz. unsweetened chocolate squares
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons vanilla
12 oz. peanut butter
13 oz. marshmallow cream

Directions:
Butter a 9 x 13 pan.  Mix the first 5 ingredients in a large saucepan, stir and cook over medium heat until melted. Do not stir after the mixture melts.  Bring to a full rolling boil, still without stirring. As soon as you have a full rolling boil, immediately begin timing for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and quickly stir in peanut butter and marshmallow cream.  Pour immediately into buttered 9 x 13 pan and refrigerate until set.

Description: 
This is my mother-in-law's wonderful fudge recipe. It requires two people to make, one to dump the ingredients in, and the other to stir constantly! (at least, that's how our family does it!) It has always come out perfectly for us, rich and creamy and not at all dry. You must keep an eye on it, and be quick about adding your ingredients so that it doesn't set up before you can get it poured into the baking dish.
