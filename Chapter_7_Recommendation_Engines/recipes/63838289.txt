Mash sour cream, cream cheese, salt, white pepper, and garlic into the potatoes with a potato masher to your desired consistency; transfer to a baking dish, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate  overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drizzle melted butter and sprinkle paprika evenly over the top of the potatoes.
