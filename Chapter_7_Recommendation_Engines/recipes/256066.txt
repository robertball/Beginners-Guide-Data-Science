Ingredients:
2 cups 1/2-inch diced sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons harissa
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 teaspoons oil
1 shallot, minced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 clove garlic, smashed
1 cup quinoa
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup thinly sliced kale
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese
2 tablespoons minced cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toss sweet potatoes, harissa, and paprika together in a bowl until coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; stir sweet potatoes and continue baking until tender and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes more.
Heat oil in a pot over medium heat; add shallot, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add quinoa, coconut milk, and chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.
Stir kale, lemon juice, and sweet potatoes into quinoa mixture. Top each serving with feta cheese and cilantro.

Description: 
The coconut milk and sweet potatoes help tame the heat from the harissa in this flavorful meal. If you use low-sodium chicken broth, be sure to add a little salt to the quinoa while it's cooking.
