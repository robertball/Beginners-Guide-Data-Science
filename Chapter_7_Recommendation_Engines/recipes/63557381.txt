Ingredients:
1/4 c Warm water (100-110F)
1 Pkg Active dry yeast
1 tsp honey
1/2 c milk
1/4 c Sriracha sauce
1/4 c warm water
1 egg lightly beaten
1 c White whole wheat flour
2-2 1/2 c bread flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c grated sharp cheddar cheese
1 tbs butter

Directions:
Combine the first 3 ingredients in a small bowl and set aside until the yeast becomes foamy.
Add the milk, Sriracha and additional water and stir in the egg.
Stir in the white whole wheat until all moistened.  Allow to rest and hydrate for 10 minutes.
Add the salt and 2 cups of bread flour and mix.  Continue adding the flour 1 tbs at a time until the dough clears the bowl and forms a ball.
Knead for about 10 minutes.  Dough will be slightly tacky.
Form the dough in a ball and place in a greased bowl, turning the ball so it is greased.  Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and set it in a warm, draft free area to rise until doubled, about 60-75 minutes.
Gently degas the dough and pat it out on a floured surface to a 9 x 12 rectangle.  Starting at the 9" side roll tightly into a log and pinch the edge to form a seam.
Place the log seam side down in a 9 x 5 loaf pan and tuck the ends under neatly.
Cover again with the tea towel and set to rise until it crests the sides of the pan, 30-45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375F and bake 30 minutes.  Loaf will sound hollow when tapped.
Spread the top with butter and cool in the pan

Don't be scared!  This bakes up to a flavorful bread that will make a great ham sandwich, Croque Monsieur or Monte Cristo.  It is also good buttered to accompany soup.
