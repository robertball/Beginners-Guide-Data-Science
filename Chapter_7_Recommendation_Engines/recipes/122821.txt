Ingredients:
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 tablespoon vinegar
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
8 (8 inch) fat-free tortillas
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, saute onion and garlic powder in oil until the onion is tender. Add turkey, vinegar, chili powder, oregano, cumin and cayenne; cook and stir over medium heat until turkey is no longer pink. Stir in beans. Remove from the heat. Combine salsa and broth; spread a thin layer in a 2-1/2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cut tortillas into 1-in. strips and then into thirds; arrange half over salsa mixture. Top with half of the turkey mixture and half of the remaining salsa mixture. Repeat layers. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until bubbly. Top servings with sour cream.
