Ingredients:
Dough:
2    pkt  active dry yeast
1    cup  warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
2/3    cup  granulated sugar plus
1    tsp  granulated sugar divided
1    cup  warmed milk
2/3    cup  butter
2    tsp  salt
2    eggs slightly beaten
7    cup  all-purpose flour - (to 8 cups)
or more if needed
Filling:
1    cup  melted butter divided
1 3/4    cup  granulated sugar divided
3    tbl  ground cinnamon
1 1/2    cup  chopped walnuts (optional)
1 1/2    cup  raisins (optional
Glaze:
1/2 cup   softened butter
4 oz.     cream cheese
1/2 lb    powdered sugar
1 tsp    vanilla
Â½ tsp    lemon juice

Directions:
In a small bowl mix together warm water, yeast and sugar and set aside. In a large bowl, mix milk, remaining 2/3 cup sugar, melted butter, salt and eggs; stir well and add yeast mixture. Add half the flour and beat until smooth. Stir in enough of the remaining flour until dough is slightly stiff (dough will be sticky).
Turn out onto a well-floured board; knead 5 to 10 minutes. Place in well-buttered glass or plastic bowl, cover and let rise in warm place, free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
When doubled, punch down dough and let rest 5 minutes. Roll out on floured surface into a 15- by 20-inch rectangle.
To prepare filling: Spread dough with 1/2 cup melted butter. Mix together 1 1/2 cups sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over buttered dough. Sprinkle with walnuts and raisins, if desired.
Roll up jellyroll-fashion and pinch edge together to seal. Cut into 15 slices. Coat bottom of a 13- by 9-inch baking pan and a 8-inch square pan with remaining 1/2 cup melted butter, then sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Place cinnamon roll slices close together in pans. Let rise in warm place until dough is doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until rolls are nicely browned. Cool rolls slightly.
To prepare glaze: Allow butter and cream cheese to reach room temp. Beat cream cheese and butter together. Slowly add the pwd. sugar, then beat for at least 12 minutes. When almost finished, add the lemon juice and vanilla. Spread over slightly cooled rolls.
This recipe yields 15 large rolls.  (15-30 servings)
