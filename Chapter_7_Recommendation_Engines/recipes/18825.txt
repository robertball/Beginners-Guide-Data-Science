Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
6 slices bacon, diced
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can pork and beans
6 slices American cheese
1 cup crushed tortilla chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef, onion and bacon for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the meat is browned and the onion is translucent; drain excess fat.
In a 3 quart casserole dish, combine the vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, green bell pepper, kidney beans, chili beans, pork and beans and the meat mixture. Stir together until well blended.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, remove from oven and top with the cheese and crushed tortilla chips. Return to oven and bake for 5 to 6 more minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Description: 
This recipe is a last-minute throw-anything-together-for-a-picnic recipe. I had a few hours to figure out what to make and I live out of town, so a trip to the store was out of the question.
