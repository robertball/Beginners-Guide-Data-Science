Ingredients:
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and black pepper to taste
8 asparagus spears, trimmed - divided
2 thick bacon strips
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.
In a skillet, saute bacon until about 3/4 done but still pliable.
Place each chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.
Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.
Place 4 spears of asparagus down the center of a chicken breast, and spread about 1/4 cup of mozzarella cheese over the asparagus.
Repeat with the other chicken breast, and roll the chicken around the asparagus and cheese to make a tidy, compact roll.
Roll the bacon around each chicken roll and secure with toothpicks if necessary.
Place the rolls seam sides down in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle each with about 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear when pricked with a fork, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
