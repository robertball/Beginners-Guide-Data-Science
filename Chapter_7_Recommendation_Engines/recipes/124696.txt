Ingredients:
9 eggs
3 cups light cream
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons rum flavored extract (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
24 (3/4 inch thick) slices French bread
PRALINE SYRUP:
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
2 tablespoons butter or margarine

Directions:
In a large bowl, lightly beat eggs. Mix in cream, sugar, rum extract if desired, vanilla and nutmeg. Place the bread in a single layer in two well-greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Pour the egg mixture over bread in each pan. Turn bread over to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until golden.
Meanwhile, for syrup, bring brown sugar, corn syrup and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Add pecans and butter; simmer 2 minutes longer. Serve with the French toast.

Description: 
I discovered this dish last year while hosting a family reunion here in the Pocono Mountains. My niece brought it and shared the recipe. It's a great dish to make ahead of time and freeze; then you'll have a fancy but easy-to-prepare breakfast whenever you host overnight guests.
