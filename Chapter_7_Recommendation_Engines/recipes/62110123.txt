Ingredients:
1 lb penne rigate
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
2 (10- to 12-oz) bags mixed salad greens with radicchio (often labeled "Italian" or "Mediterranean")
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiana-Reggiano, plus additional for serving

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Combine butter, oil, and pine nuts in cleaned and dried pot and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until nuts are pale golden, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Stir in greens and cook, stirring, until they wilt, about 3 minutes. Add penne, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Stir in cheese and serve immediately with additional cheese on the side.

Description: 
My daughter has proclaimed this the best pasta dish she has ever had. Something this easy shouldn't taste this good. Don't be afraid to use a lot of greens!
