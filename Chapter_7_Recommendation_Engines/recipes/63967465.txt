Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
4 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
1/4 cup minced onion
1 clove garlic
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese at room temperature
Shredded cheddar cheese
Green onions
Sour Cream (optional)

Directions:
Bake the potatoes in the microwave with the skin on.
Let them cool down and then peel them and cut them into chunks. (If you are using red potatoes leave the skin on them.)
Saut√© the onions and garlic in a pan with butter really slow so they don't brown.
Add the chicken broth in the pot first, then the onions and butter and spices.
Mash the cream cheese through a wire strainer with the back of a spoon.
After the soup comes to a slow boil, add the potatoes and turn in down on simmer for a while.
Serve with cheddar cheese and green onions. You can also add a dollop of sour cream.
