Title:
Freezer Paleo Maple, Mustard Grilled Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/3 c Dijon mustard
3 T  Maple Syrup
1 stem fresh rosemary, chopped

Directions:
In a large zip-top bag, add the mustard, maple syrup & rosemary, including the rosemary stem. Smush around to incorporate. Taste the marinade and see if you want to add more maple or mustard. Add the chicken and let marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
Heat a large saute or grill pan (obviously a grill would work too) over medium-high heat. Melt a few tablespoons of fat (butter, ghee, duck/bacon fat), and sear the chicken thighs, about 4 (undisturbed) minutes per side. Be sure not to overcrowd the saute/grill pan, as you want the chicken to develop a nice char on the outside.
While the chicken thighs are cooking…
Pour the marinade in a small saute pan (minus the rosemary stem). Let it come to a simmer and keep it there for about 4-5 minutes, whisking occasionally. If you find the sauce has gotten too thick, add a little stock to it. And bam…you’ve turned the marinade into a sauce. Yay.
You can either serve the sauce on the side or brush it over the tops of the grilled thighs.
