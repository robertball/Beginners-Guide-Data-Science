Heat a heavy iron or steel pan and add oil. Add the peppers and blister, letting them sit on one side and then tossing a few times until they at blistered all the way around. About 8 minutes.  Season with sea salt. Lay the lemon slices in the pan so that they are flat to the bottom of the pan. Allow the lemons to color slightly and flip. About 2 minutes total. Remove to a bowl and squeeze the lemon over the peppers. Sprinkle on the flake salt and drizzle with the extra olive oil. Make a Classic Martini.

Description: 
Classic Martini but garnished with blistered Shishito Peppers and lemon slices. I also like this in a Dirty Martini. Any roasted or blistered peppers can be used depending on how sweet or hot you may like it.
