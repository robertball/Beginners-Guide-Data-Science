Ingredients:
4 c. thin pretzels
1 stick butter, melted
1/3 c. sugar
1 box brownie mix, prepared according to package directions

Directions:
Give each handful of pretzels one "crunch" before putting in the measuring cup.  Measure 4 cups in this manner.
Use food processor to crush, or crush them in a gallon Ziploc bag, until small pieces, but not a powder
Place in mixing bowl and add melted butter and sugar.  Mix until well moistened.
Press into bottom of greased pan. Bake at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool, preferably in fridge. Reduce oven temp to 350 degrees.  Prepare Brownie mix according to package directions.
Pour over pretzel crust, and spread gently so as not to pick up any pretzels.  Bake according to package directions for a 13x9 pan.
Remove from oven and cool slightly before cutting (you know how brownies are!) Enjoy!
