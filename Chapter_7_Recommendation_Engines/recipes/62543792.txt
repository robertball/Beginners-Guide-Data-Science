Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
2/3 cup warm water
1/4 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)

Directions:
Combine and mix all together all purpose flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl.
Mix and stir in warm water and oil in separate bowl/glass. Then pour into the flour mixed.
Stir all ingredients with mixer (or by hand) until mixture leaves the side of the bowl.
Gather dough together and press into a ball.
Fill in the sink with hot water, put the bowl of dough on it and cover it with wet towel to let it rise for 30 minutes. (note: will turn to a small rising)
Knead in the dough and then pick up the whole ball of dough and slam it down onto a litely floured surface. Repeat it 50-100 times and knead a bit in between. (great exercise and make a good dough)
Roll out the dough in your usual manner. Then place it on pizza pan. Top as desired.
Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 20 - 25 minutes.
