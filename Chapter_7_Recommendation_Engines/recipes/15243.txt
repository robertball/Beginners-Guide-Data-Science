Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter, softened
4 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
First, the crust: In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture is mealy. Press in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is light golden brown.
While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In the same medium bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, flour and baking powder with an electric mixer until light, about 3 minutes. Then stir in the lemon juice. Pour the filling over the crust while it  is still warm from the oven. Bake for an additional 25 to 30 minutes until the top is slightly browned. Remove from the oven and cool.
In a small bowl, stir lemon juice into the confectioners' sugar  1 tablespoon at a time until the icing is  of a spreadable consistency. Spread evenly over the cooled bars. Cut into squares.
