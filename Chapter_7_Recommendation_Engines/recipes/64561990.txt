Ingredients:
3/4 cup Creamy Peanut Butter
1-1/4 cup Oats
1/4 tsp Cinnamon
1/4 cups Water - more if needed

Directions:
Mix the peanut butter, cinnamon and water.  Mixture should be fairly thick.....add additional water, if needed, a little at a time.
Slowly add the oats.
Shape into balls (size is your own preference).  I used a small cookie scoop.

Description: 
These are a quick and easy snack.  They last in the fridge for about 2 weeks and in the freezer for about 2 months.  Found them, while I was looking for homemade treats for the furkid.  They work great for sneaking pills to them.
