Ingredients:
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups shortening
3 eggs
3 tablespoons milk
3 tablespoons caraway seed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line them with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and baking powder. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In another bowl, beat the eggs, milk, seeds and lemon zest until blended well. Add to the dry ingredients and blend until smooth. If the dough seems a bit stiff, add extra milk, one tablespoon at a time.
On a floured surface, roll dough out 1/4 inch thick and cut using a 2-inch round cutter.  lace cookies 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
