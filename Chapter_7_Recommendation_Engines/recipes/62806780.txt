Ingredients:
-1.5 pounds chicken breast or tenders (boneless, skinless)
-1 box of low sodium chicken broth; For an even lower sodium content you can use homemade chicken broth.
-2 large cans of whole peeled tomatoes
-2 large onions diced
-2 tbsp minced garlic
-1 can black beans
-1 can corn
-1 can diced tomatoes
-Juice from two limes or 1 tbsp bottled lime juice
-1/2 cup 2% shredded Mexican cheese
-1 bunch of cilantro
-1/2 an avocado
-1/4 cup pickeled jalapenos
-5 radishes thinly sliced
-1 tbsp Chipolte pepper paste or 2 chipolte pepper bouline cubes
-1 cup crushed baked tortilla chips

Directions:
Using cooking spray grill the diced onions and the minced garlic until they are soft.
Transfer mix to blender or food processor, adding lime juice and whole peeled tomatoes. Return mix to soup pot and add broth.
Bring mix to a simmer and add whole pieces of chicken. Poach the chicken in the soup until cooked. About 10 minutes. Remove chicken from soup mix and set aside.
Add corn, diced tomatoes, and black beans to soup mix while continuing to simmer soup. Add chipolte paste or cubes.
Shred the chicken pieces. Chop up garnishes (Jalapenos, radishes, avocado, cilantro).
Add the chicken to the soup right before serving. Garnish soup with radishes, avocado, jalapenos, cilantro and crushed tortilla chips. Sprinkle lightly with cheese. Not included, but is also good with a little bit of fat free sour cream.

Description: 
This recipe is loosely based on a recipe out of Cook this not that. I made some modifications to make things easier.

This was by far one of the best soups I have ever made. All the flavors blended so well but still stood out separately. This is a great soup for getting all your vegetables in.
