Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground beef
1 cup finely diced onion
1 cup catsup
1 cup chipotle catsup*
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup honey mustard

Directions:
Brown the meat and the onions.
Drain thoroughly.
Process in food processor until uniform in size.  (I have a small food processor so it took four batches to get it processed.)
Return to pan and add remaining ingredients.
Heat through and simmer for an hour.
When ready to serve, reheat and/or place in crock pot for serving.
