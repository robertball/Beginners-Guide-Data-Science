Ingredients:
1 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1 cup powdered non-dairy creamer
1 cup French vanilla flavored powdered non-dairy creamer
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups unsweetened instant tea
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 tea Coriander
1 tea Allspice
1 tea Nutmeg

Directions:
In a large *plastic bag*, combine milk powder, non-dairy creamer, vanilla flavored creamer, sugar and instant tea.
In a small bowl combine spices: ginger, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, Coriander, Allspice and Nutmeg. Re-grind spices in a spice/herb grinder, mill or coffee grinder several times until they are as fine as possible. (if your coffee grinder is dirty run 1 cup of white sugar or rice through it to clean)
Combine spices with the rest of the ingredients in the large bag. Seal and toss around a bit to stir.
Add 2-4 tablespoons mix to hot water to taste. I like it rich so I add 4 tbl to one mug of water.
