Ingredients:
1 (7.5 ounce) jar hoisin sauce
4  bone-in chicken breast halves
4  chicken thighs

Directions:
Pour hoisin sauce into a resealable plastic bag, and add the chicken breasts and thighs. Squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Prepare the grill for indirect heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from marinade.  Discard marinade.  Grill chicken over indirect heat, skin side down, for 20 minutes.  Turn; grill until chicken is no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, about 10 additional minutes.
