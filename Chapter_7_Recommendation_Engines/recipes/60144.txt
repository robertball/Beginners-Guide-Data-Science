Ingredients:
3 cups uncooked Arborio rice
6 cups water
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup water
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 eggs
1 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 eggs, beaten
3 cups bread crumbs
4 cups oil for frying, or as needed
1 (14 ounce) jar marinara sauce

Directions:
Combine water and rice in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until tender. Set aside to cool completely.
Place ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring to crumble until evenly browned. Drain excess grease, then stir in the tomato paste and water. Set aside to cool. When cool, stir in mozzarella cheese.
In a medium bowl, stir together 2 eggs, Romano cheese, salt, pepper, and 1 cup of the bread crumbs. Stir into the cooled rice until well blended.
Place about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the rice mixture into the palm of your hand. Make a well in the center, and place a heaping tablespoon of the beef mixture into it. Mold rice around the filling into the shape of an egg. Dip in beaten egg, then roll in remaining bread crumbs until well coated. Repeat with remaining rice and filling.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Carefully place the rice balls into the hot oil, a few at a time, and fry until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and set on paper towels to drain. Serve hot with marinara sauce for dipping.
