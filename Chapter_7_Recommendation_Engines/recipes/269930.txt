Ingredients:
1 pound blood oranges
1/4 cup lemon juice, or as needed (optional)
3 eggs, whisked
1 cup white sugar
1 dash salt
1/2 cup butter, cubed
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed in the refrigerator
1/4 cup orange marmalade, warmed
1 blood orange, thinly sliced (optional)

Directions:
Zest 2 blood oranges and set aside. Juice enough blood oranges to make 3/4 cup juice. Strain juice and discard pulp and seeds. If there is not enough juice to make 3/4 cup after straining, supplement with lemon juice.
Whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, and blood orange juice in a saucepan. Slowly warm mixture over low heat. Add butter and blood orange zest. Heat until curd has thickened, stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes.
Pour curd into a bowl and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Place plastic wrap directly onto the top of the curd and refrigerate until ready to use.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) or temperature recommended on puff pastry package. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out puff pastry following package directions into a rectangular shape on a lightly floured surface. Cut into smaller rectangles, about 3x5 inches each. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake pastry according to package instructions until puffed up and browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with warmed marmalade. Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
Top each puff pastry rectangle with a dollop of blood orange marmalade curd. If desired, top with blood orange slices.
