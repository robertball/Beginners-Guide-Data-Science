Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rotini pasta
1/4 cup butter
20 cooked large shrimp, tails removed
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes (packed in oil)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
fresh ground black pepper to taste
sea salt to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook shrimp in hot butter until mostly pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour white wine, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce over the shrimp mixture; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle tomatoes and parsley over the shrimp mixture; cook until the tomatoes are warmed, about 1 minute.
Divide pasta between 2 bowls; top each portion with about half the shrimp and sauce. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This shrimp scampi recipe varies from the typical one as there are sun dried tomatoes in the recipe. This is like eye candy when presented in a warmed ramekin dish with some chopped parsley and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese added to the top.  Hubby says this is his favorite scampi and better than any he gets at an upscale restaurant.
