Ingredients:
1 lb casserole size elbow macaroni or cavatappi
1/2 c butter
1/2 c flour
1 1/2 tsp salt
4 cups whole milk
8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar
8 ounces sliced American cheese (plus a few additional slices for topping)
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Spray a 9x13 pan with cooking spray. Cook the macaroni as directed on the box.  While the macaroni is cooking, prepare the cheese sauce. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in flour, cooking and whisking for about 2 minutes to form a roux.  Whisk in salt.  Slowly whisk in milk, and heat until smooth and thickened.  Add both cheeses and stir until smooth and creamy.  Add pepper to taste.  Drain the cooked macaroni and add to prepared 9x13 pan.  Immediately pour cheese sauce over macaroni and mix well, making sure all macaroni is coated.  Top with reserved slices of cheese or your favorite cracker or breadcrumb topping.  Bake uncovered for about 25 minutes or until top is nicely browned.
