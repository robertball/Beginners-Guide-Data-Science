Ingredients:
1 1/3 cup boiling water
1 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 oz  molasses (scant 1/3 cup)
2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 TBSP Dry Malt Diastatic
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk
18oz Bread Flour
1 egg

Directions:
Pour boiling water over oats and let set for 30 minutes.
Add remaining ingredients and knead.
(I use a Kitchen Aid and knead for 10 minutes on 2)
Dough should be little sticky, but not impossible to handle.
Cover and raise. I put mine in my oven on the "proof setting" and it takes at least 90 minutes to 120 minutes to raise. Punch down and repeat. Usually takes less time then the first.
Punch down second rise and let set for 15 minutes.
Shape into a log shapes, prick top with toothpicks and let raise for an hour.
Bake at 350 on a pizza stone for 30 minutes.
You can also use loaf pans, and forget the stone.
