Shape into a rectangle, wrap in plastic wrap and chill.
2.Place chicken in a saucepan and cover with broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until cooked through, 15-20 min. Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken to cutting board. Strain broth; reserve. When cool shred into bite-size pieces.
3.Preheat oven to 375F. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Mist a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
4.Melt butter with oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potato, onion, carrot, celery and mushroom, sprinkle with 2t salt and 1/2t pepper and stir well. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until veg. have softened 15-20 min.
5. Sprinkle flour over veg. Cook, stirring, for 3 min. Add 2C of reserved broth and milk, increase heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring, for 3 min. Stir in peas, reserved chicken and thyme. If mixture is very thick, thin with some of the broth. Season with additional salt and pepper. Transfer to baking dish.

Patch any tears. Press pastry to edges of dish, trim if necessary and crimp to seal. Brush top of pie with remaining egg. Cut a few silts in the top to allow steam to escape.
