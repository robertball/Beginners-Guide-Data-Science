Ingredients:
1/2 pound/250 grams broccoli rabe, finely chopped
Salt
1 pound/500 grams orecchiette
1/2 cup/120 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil
6 anchovy fillets, minced
Pepper
Grated ricotta salata or toasted bread crumbs, homemade or commercial, for serving

Directions:
Put the broccoli rabe into a large pot of salted cold water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. When it is boiling, raise the heat to high and add the orecchiette. Cook until the pasta is al dente, 8 to 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat together the oil and anchovy fillets in a small pan over medium heat. When the pasta is ready, drain it and the greens and transfer them to a warmed serving bowl. Pour the anchovy oil over the top and season generously with pepper; if necessary, add a little salt. Pass the cheese at the table.
