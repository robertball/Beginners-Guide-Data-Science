Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
3 cups grated zucchini
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup flaxseed meal (optional)
1/2 cup unsweetened baking cocoa (such as GhirardelliÂ®)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 pint blueberries
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans.
Whisk white sugar, oil, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Fold in grated zucchini. Add 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flaxseed meal, cocoa, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cardamom; mix until batter is combined.
Combine blueberries and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour in a small bowl; toss to combine.
Fold blueberry mixture gently into the batter. Pour batter into loaf pans, filling each one 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
Getting my super picky kids to eat vegetables is always a challenge. My oldest loves chocolate and my youngest loves blueberries, so I combined the two into one recipe. I used a blend of whole wheat and white flours, added some flax seed, and tried to keep both sugar and fat content on the lower end. Enjoy!
