Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup whipping cream
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Roll dough into a 20-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Brush with butter.  Combine the brown sugar, walnuts and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough.  Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side.  Cut into 20 slices, 1 in. thick.  Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Drizzle with cream.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.  Invert onto a serving platter.  In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar and milk; drizzle over rolls.  Serve warm.
