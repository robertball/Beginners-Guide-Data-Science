Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
1 cup sliced celery
1/2 cup diced red onion
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 cups no-salt-added chicken broth
20 Italian meatballs, preferably home made
1/2 cup pastina pasta
6 ounces baby spinach
4 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Pour in oil and heat until hot. Add carrots, celery, and red onion; cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with parsley, basil, and pepper.  Pour in chicken broth and add meatballs. Close and lock the lid. Close the valve and select the Soup function according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add pastina and stir to combine. Replace the lid. Close the valve and select the Soup function according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and stir. Let soup sit for 5 minutes so pasta will be fully cooked and spinach will be wilted. Season with salt to taste.
Ladle into bowls and top with Parmesan cheese.
