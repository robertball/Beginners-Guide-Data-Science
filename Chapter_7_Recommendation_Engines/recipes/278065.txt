1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 Thai chile, chopped

Directions:
Toss cabbage with vinegar, sugar, coriander, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Massage spices into cabbage using your hands. Adjust seasoning as desired with additional sugar or salt. Stir in Thai chile. Cover and chill until sugar and salt dissolve, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
Sour flavors are important in Filipino cooking, and quick pickles both heighten the sourness and serve as palate-cleansers, balancing and cutting through fattier dishes. This cold-flash-pickling method works with all kinds of vegetables (green papaya, radishes, and carrots are traditional), but red cabbage is an easy and gorgeous place to start. Store in the refrigerate for up to 3 days.
