Description: 
Coming home from work tired and hungry is no fun, especially when that same old quick salad is getting boring.  That's how this recipe was born. I make and freeze nearly-done penne ahead of time to really speed up this fast and tasty meal for one. Easily adjusted to make more servings--this is a quick meal that tastes special and like much more work than it is.
