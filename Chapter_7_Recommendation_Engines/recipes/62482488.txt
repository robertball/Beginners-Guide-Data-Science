Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (one cellophane package)
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
5 eggs
2 egg yolks
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/8 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Mix the graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup of the white sugar, and the melted butter together. Press mixture into the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, eggs and egg yolks; mix until smooth, but beat slowly so you don't incorporate too much air into the batter. Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups white sugar, the flour and the heavy cream. Blend until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Cook at 200Â° for 3 hours and 10 minutes. Turn off oven, prop open door, let cool, then refrigerate.
