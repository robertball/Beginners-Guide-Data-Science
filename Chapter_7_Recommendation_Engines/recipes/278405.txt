Ingredients:
2 small yellow potatoes
10 eggs
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1 teaspoon lemon zest
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup diced red onions
1 cup asparagus, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1/2 cup smoked salmon, broken into small pieces
1/3 cup shredded Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool.
Whisk 10 eggs in a bowl. Add hot sauce, chopped tarragon, chopped chives, lemon zest, salt, and pepper to eggs and whisk.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Dice potatoes once cooled.
Heat an ovenproof pan on medium-high heat and add olive oil. Add onions, potatoes, and asparagus to pan and saute for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add egg mixture to pan. Stir in smoked salmon and Gruyere cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes or until eggs puff up. Cool for a few minutes and serve.
