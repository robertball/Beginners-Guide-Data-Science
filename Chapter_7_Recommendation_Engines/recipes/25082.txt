Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Stir together the whole wheat flour, salt and baking soda; set aside.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the egg, water and vanilla. Mix in the flour mixture, then stir in the oats. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
