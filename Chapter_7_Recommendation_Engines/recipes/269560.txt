Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
1 medium onion, finely chopped
5 cups water
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup
2 large potatoes, cubed
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 cubes beef bouillon
3 pinches cayenne pepper, or to taste
3 dashes hot pepper sauce, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Add cabbage and onion. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally to keep from burning, until onions are translucent and cabbage is tender, about 35 minutes.
Add water, tomato soup, potatoes, garlic, beef bouillon, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and salt. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
This cabbage soup is perfect for a chilly winter night. I like my food fairly spicy, so be sure to adjust spices if this is not the case for you. I eat this with a small dollop of sour cream on top and a slice of crusty bread to mop up any remaining soup with!
