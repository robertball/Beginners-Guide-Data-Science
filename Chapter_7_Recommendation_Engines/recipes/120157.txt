Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.
Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface.  Pat dough flat.  Let rest for 5 minutes.  Press into a greased 14-in. pizza pan.  Spread with salad dressing.  Combine the garlic powder, oregano, thyme and pepper; sprinkle over dough.  Top with cheeses.  Bake at 450 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.
