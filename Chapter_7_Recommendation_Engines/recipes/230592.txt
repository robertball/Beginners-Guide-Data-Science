Ingredients:
1 box Barilla Whole Grain Linguine
2 red bell peppers
2 yellow bell peppers
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh parsley
1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
2 cups cauliflower florets (optional)

Directions:
Broil peppers for 15-20 minutes or until skins are blackened and blistered, turning occasionally. Place peppers in a tightly closed bag and let stand for 10-15 minutes.
Remove skins and seeds. Cut into thin strips and set aside.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and saute until slightly yellow.
Meanwhile, add cauliflower florets to the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes (skip this step if cauliflower is omitted).
Add roasted bell pepper strips to the skillet and saute for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Drain pasta, reserving 1/3 cup of cooking liquid.
Toss pasta with the sauce. If needed, add some cooking liquid to the skillet. Toss pasta with parsley and mix well.
Top with cheese before serving.
