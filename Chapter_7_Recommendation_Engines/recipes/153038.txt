Ingredients:
1 cup BACARDI速 Select Rum
1 (18.5 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1 (3.5 ounce) package chocolate instant pudding mix
4 eggs
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips, divided
1 cup raspberry preserves
2 tablespoons shortening
1 ounce white chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease a 12-cup bundt, 10-inch tube pan or 10-inch springform pan.
Combine cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, 1/2 cup BACARDI(R) Select Rum, water and oil in a large mixing bowl.  Using an electric mixer, beat at low speed until moistened.  Beat at medium speed 2 minutes.  Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate chips.  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake 50 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean.  Cool in pan 15 minutes.  Remove from pan and let cool on a rack.  In a small saucepan, heat preserves and remaining 1/2 cup BACARDI(R) Select Rum.  Strain through a sieve to remove seeds.  Place cake on a serving plate.  Prick surface of cake with fork.  Brush raspberry glaze evenly over cake, allowing cake to absorb glaze. Repeat until all glaze has been absorbed.
In a glass bowl, combine remaining chocolate chips and shortening.  Microwave on medium-high until melted, about 1 minute.  Stir until smooth.  (Or heat over hot, not boiling, water until melted.) Spoon chocolate icing over cake.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Melt white chocolate and drizzle on top of chocolate icing.
