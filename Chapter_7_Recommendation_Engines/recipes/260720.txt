Ingredients:
4 cups peeled and cubed butternut squash (1/2-inch pieces)
2 large carrots, sliced
2 apples - peeled, cored, and quartered
1 shallot, peeled and quartered
1/2 yellow onion, quartered
4 sprigs fresh rosemary
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
2 1/2 cups College Inn® Chicken Broth, warmed
1/2 cup heavy cream, warmed

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.
Peel and cut up vegetables and apples and arrange along with rosemary sprigs on a large rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Roast for 35 minutes until butternut squash and carrots are softened, tossing mixture halfway through.
Remove rosemary sprigs from the tray; transfer the vegetable mixture to a blender or food processor and pulse the mixture to break down the larger pieces and then blend together until smooth.
Once the mixture is nearly smooth, add in warmed chicken broth and cream and pulse for an additional 30-60 seconds to combine. Serve hot with crusty bread, add a swirl of creme fraiche, fresh herbs or salty roasted pepitas for garnishes.
