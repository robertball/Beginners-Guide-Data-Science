Ingredients:
10 oz best quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped
2 qt milk
1 t pure vanilla extract

Directions:
1.  Combine chocolate and milk in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Whisk until chocolate is melted and milk is very hot and frothy, about 20 minutes.
2.  Remove from heat.  Add vanilla; pour into a blender, filling halfway.  Blend, holding lid in place (the hot liquid will expand), until frothy.  Serve immediately.  Blend remaining milk and chocolate mixture.
