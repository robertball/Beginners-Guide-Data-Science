Ingredients:
1 box of white cake mix (yellow works well also)
3/4 cup of coconut milk
1/2 a 15oz can of pineapple tidbits thoroughly drained
1/2 cup unsweetened dessicated coconut (very fine pieces)
3 eggs
1 can of prepared frosting
3 tsp rum
1 cup confectioners sugar
1/2 cup of unsweetened dessicated coconut

Directions:
Place drained pineapple, coconut milk, and eggs in blender. Puree until thoroughly mixed. In a large bowl combine first amount of dessciated coconut, cake mix powder with pineapple coconut milk and egg puree. Beat 2 minutes on low. Place into prepared muffin tins with liners. I fill higher than 2/3rds full for bigger cupcakes. Bake 20-24 minutes.
Scoop frosting into a medium bowl and add rum. Stir to combine. Add extra confectioners sugar to stiffen the frosting again. Place in fridge while cupcakes cool.
Toast second amount of coconut in small frying pan until golden, keep stirring and watch carefully as it browns quickly.
When cupcakes have completely cooled frost with rum frosting, and dip into the toasted coconut to completely cover the top.
