Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup diced onion
1 cup diced carrot
1 cup diced celery
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
4 cups water
4 teaspoons salt, divided
2 cups almond milk
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, water, and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove pot from the heat and puree soup with an immersion blender. Stir in almond milk.
Return soup to the heat and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with remaining 2 teaspoons salt and pepper.

Description: 
My mother and I came up with this one night when an abundance of potatoes were around. The almond milk makes it so smooth and creamy. Enjoy! Top with green onions or any other topping for a great warm winter day soup.
