Ingredients:
2 lbs turnip (white radish)
2 Cups rice flour
1 Cup Sweet rice starch
3 Cups Water
2 pcs Chinese sausages (~100g)
6 pcs dried black mushroom
4 pcs dried scallop
30g dried shrimps
2 each shallots, finely sliced
Marinades
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp wine
Seasonings
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp soy sauce
1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1 tbsp oil

Directions:
Turnips: Peel, rinse, shred (I use a food processor for cutting, which helps complete the task in just a few minutes). Rest all the turnip strips in a colander above a basin to drain and collect its juice. Draining the turnips is to prepare it for stir-frying as well as to reserve its juice for combining with the rice flour and corn starch.
Four Delicacies: We called the ingredients for cooking with the turnip the four delicacies, namely the Chinese sausages, dried mushrooms, dried scallops, dried shrimps.
Chinese sausages – rinse, coarsely chopped
dried mushrooms – rinse, soak in 1 cup of water for at least an hour or until soft, squeeze water in them and coarsely chopped, reserve water
dried scallops – rinse, soak in 1/2 cup of water for at least an hour, tear them into strips, reserve water
dried shrimps – rinse, soak in 1/2 cup of water for 10 minutes, discard water
Marinade the reconstituted, chopped mushrooms, scallops and shrimps for about 10 minutes.
