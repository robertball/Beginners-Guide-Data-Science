Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup pearl couscous
2 tbsps olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
3 garlic cloves, minced
7 oz dried figs, stems removed and finely chopped
1/3 cup aged balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp honey
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
4 oz crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
3/4 cup toasted walnuts, chopped
4 cups fresh baby spinach, rinsed and dried

Directions:
1. Prepare couscous: In a medium sized pot, bring 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in couscous, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until couscous is cooked and water is fully absorbed. Place couscous in large bowl and set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in onion, and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until slightly caramelized. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add in dried figs and cook until they soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Mix in balsamic vinegar, honey, salt and black pepper. Continue to cook until mixture thickens slightly, about 4-5 minutes. Pour fig mixture over the cooked couscous, and stir to combine. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Add 2 tbsps of crumbled Gorgonzola and the toasted walnuts to the couscous; toss to combine.
3. Prepare salad: Divide spinach between four serving dishes. Top each with equal amounts of fig and couscous mixture. Top each salad with additional Gorgonzola crumbles, if desired. Serve immediately.
