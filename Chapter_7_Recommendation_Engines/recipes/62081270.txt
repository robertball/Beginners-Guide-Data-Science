Description: 
We love this!  It is an easy, tasty recipe.  It's a lot like cooking chicken in BBQ sauce, only better.  We eat this a lot because I generally have every ingredient on hand.  We like it best with macaroni and cheese.  We spoon the sauce over the chicken and the macaroni and cheese.  Then again, we're from Pennsylvania, so it's normal to eat ketchup on mac and cheese and this sweet and tangy ketchup sauce with onions is even better!
