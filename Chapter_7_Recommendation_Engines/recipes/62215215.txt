Ingredients:
9 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons sugar
3 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs
6 ounces fresh blueberries
1 tsp vanilla extract
lemon zest or 1 tsp lemon juice

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Stir in eggs and ricotta cheese until well blended. Mix in vanilla and lemon juice if using.
Gently fold in blueberries.
Pour 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on top, then turn to brown other side.
Make sure your griddle is heated thoroughly and maintain a medium heat. Since this batter is a bit heavier and thicker, they need to cook a little more slowly than other pancakes.
Use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a thinner, rounder pancake right when you put them on the griddle.
Serve immediately with choice of condiments.
