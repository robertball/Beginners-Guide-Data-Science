Ingredients:
Puff Pastry, cut into 4 inch squares
Egg wash
2 cups chicken mince
1/2 cup spring onions, chopped
1 red chilli, chopped (optional)
1 cup canned waterchestnuts, chopped
1 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon seasame oil
white pepper
Chilli Sauce (optional)
1/2 cup chilli sauce
2 tablespoons tomato sauce
2 tablespoons ginger, grated
2 tablespoons warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon vinegar

Directions:
1. In a mixing bowl, combine chicken mince, spring onions, red chilli, waterchestnuts, soy sauce, seasame oil and a generous amount of white pepper. Cover and chill for at least 10 minutes.
2. Set oven to moderate heat.
3. On each pastry square, scoop a heaped tablespoonful of the chicken mixture, bring the corners of the pastry together (over the filling) and give it a twist, fold down the tip to ensure they stay together. Repeat this pattern with the remaining pastry and chicken filling and bake on a greased baking tray, for about 7 minutes. Quickly brush pastry with egg wash and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and crusty.
4. In a bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water, then add in the remaining ingredients and mix well. This can be prepared in advance and chilled until needed.
