Ingredients:
1/3 cup water
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/8 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley
1/8 teaspoon dried mint
2 pounds sugar snap peas, strings removed
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Combine water, olive oil, garlic, thyme, rosemary, basil, parsley, and mint in a wok over high heat. Bring to a boil. Slide sugar snap peas and green beans into the wok and toss to coat. Cover wok and reduce heat to medium. Cook, tossing occasionally, until peas and beans are bright green and tender-crisp, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.
