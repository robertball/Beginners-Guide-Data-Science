Ingredients:
4 pork bone-in rib chops, about 3/4-inch thick, trimmed
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pineapple Salsa*:
3 slices pineapple, cut crosswise about 1/2-inch thick, trimmed OR canned pineapple slices, drained
1 jalapeno pepper, halved lengthwise, seeds and veins removed
1 tablespoon lime juice
Salt, to taste

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, combine chili powder, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Sprinkle both sides of pork with spice mixture.
Prepare a grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill pork until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Grill pineapple (if using fresh) and jalapeno until lightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove chops from grill and let rest 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, dice pineapple and finely dice jalapeno. In a medium bowl, combine pineapple, jalapeno, and lime juice. Season to taste with salt.
