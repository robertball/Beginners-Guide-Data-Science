Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 1/2 cups cooked chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 cups chopped, cooked broccoli
1/4 cup sliced almonds
4 tablespoons butter
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes
4 ounces grated sharp Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup crushed pork rinds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour olive oil into a 9x13-inch baking dish and spread all over the bottom and sides. Place cooked chicken in a single layer in the bottom of the dish. Distribute cooked broccoli evenly over the chicken and sprinkle with almonds.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add cream; cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in cream cheese pieces until melted and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken, broccoli, and almonds; top with crushed pork rinds.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Sometimes, I overestimate what my family will eat. No worries, a casserole will help use up those leftovers! You may use any combination of cooked chicken--dark and white, all dark, or all white. I used chicken thighs. Add some leftover cooked broccoli and some pantry items, and you are there.  It's a 'keto' recipe, to boot!
