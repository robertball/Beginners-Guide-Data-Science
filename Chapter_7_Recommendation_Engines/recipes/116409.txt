Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, cubed
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup molasses
2 teaspoons white vinegar
1 egg, beaten
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the butter, sugar, molasses and vinegar; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat; cool to lukewarm. Stir in egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon and salt; stir into molasses mixture to form a soft dough.
Divide dough into thirds. Shape each portion into a disk; wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until easy to handle.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 3-in. gingerbread boy cookie cutter. Place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 7-9 minutes or until edges are firm. Remove to wire racks.

Description: 
Mom always used the same round-headed cookie cutter to make her boys. They always came out of the oven soft and chewy with plenty of traditional molasses-ginger flavor. --Donna Sasser Hinds, Milwaukie, Oregon
