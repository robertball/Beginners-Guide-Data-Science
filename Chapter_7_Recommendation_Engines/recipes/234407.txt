Description: 
Here's an old-time hamburger and mixed vegetable soup, made the way Grandma made it...if Grandma had a slow cooker. If you can't go home and check on it on a week day be sure to added extra broth at the beginning. A large bag of frozen mixed vegetables can be used in place of the canned vegetables.
