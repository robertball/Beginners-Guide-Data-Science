Ingredients:
2 lbs. halibut, or any fish, cut into desired portions
4 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
2 cups thinly sliced onions
1 c. mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
In a bowl, combine mushrooms and onions. In a separate bowl combine mayonnaise, sugar,  sriracha, lemon juice, sesame oil and soy sauce. Mix well.
Foil line a cookie sheet and coat with cooking spray. Cut fish into desired portions and put together so all pieces are touching.
Mix mayonnaise mixture , mushrooms and onions together and spread all over fish. Squeeze a half of a lemon all over top. Sprinkle with kosher salt.
Bake at 375 degrees in the middle of the oven (3rd row) for approx 15-20 minutes, depending on the thickness. Then move up to the 2nd row and broil on high for approx 10 min. or until the top is brown.
Plate sushi rice. Squeeze the other half of lemon all over the top of rice. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, and carefully place fish on top. Sprinkle with green onions.
Serve with a lemon wedge and steamed broccoli.
*Note - This would be great over chicken breasts too!
