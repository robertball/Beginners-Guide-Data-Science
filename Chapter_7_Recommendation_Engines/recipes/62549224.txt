Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
10 (6 inch) flour tortillas (fajita size)
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 (4.5 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 cup sour cream
3 cups shredded, cooked chicken
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
2 cups shredded "taco" cheese, divided
1 (14.5 ounce) can enchilada sauce
1/4 cup sliced green onions

Directions:
Spread about 2 tablespoons of beans on each tortilla. Combine soup and sour cream; stir in chopped green chiles, cumin, chili powder and chicken. Spoon 1/3 to 1/2 cup down the center of each tortilla; top with 1 tablespoon cheese. Roll up and place seam side down in two disposable greased 8-in. x 8-in. x 2-in. pans (5 in each pan). If serving immediately, pour enchilada sauce over top; sprinkle with onions and remaining cheese.  (If freezing, instead place encilada sauce in one freezer ziploc bag, and cheese and onions in another.) Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until heated through.
