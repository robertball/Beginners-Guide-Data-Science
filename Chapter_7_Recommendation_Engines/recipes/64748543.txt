Ingredients:
1 pound penne rigate
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
12 ounces spicy Italian sausage (about 4 links), casings removed
2 shallots, diced
2 cup frozen corn, thawed
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus for the pasta water
8 ounces mascarpone, room temperature
1 tablespoon Calabrian chile paste
1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano, plus for serving
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the penne and cook according to package directions or until al dente. Drain well, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.
Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and sausage; cook for about 5 minutes, breaking up the sausage into bite-size pieces with a wooden spoon. Add the shallots and cook for another minute. Stir in the corn and salt, and cook, stirring often, until the corn is warmed through, another 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl.
To the bowl, add the mascarpone, chile paste and the hot pasta and reserved pasta water. Add the Parmesan directly over the untossed hot pasta. Using a large serving spoon, toss everything together well. Add the basil and toss again. Serve with additional Parmesan if desired.

Description: 
This dish has a little bit of sweet from the corn and the mascarpone.  While being spicy from the spicy italian sausage, the chile paste adds a dose of under heat notes and the Parmigiano Reggiano adds  a little bit of tangness.  Makes the best leftovers and also a great dish for meal prepping for a week in the fridge.
