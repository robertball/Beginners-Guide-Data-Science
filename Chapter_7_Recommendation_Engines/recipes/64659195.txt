Ingredients:
2 cups romaine lettuce chopped
2 cups fresh, uncooked spinach chopped
1 cup fresh, uncooked asparagus cut into small pieces
1 cup fresh, uncooked broccoli cut into small pieces
2 roma tomatoes cut into small wedges
6 Tb of your favorite, low cal dressing (must be 24 calories or less per tablespoon)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients well, eat and enjoy! This makes a huge salad. And though the ingredients don't add up to make for a particularly tasty salad, you at least feel pretty satisfied after eating it due to its high fiber content.
This is a great salad to eat every day. To mix it up, switch out the tomatoes for sliced radishes or add minced onion or 1/2 a cup of peas or corn. Or simply just switch the low cal salad dressing you use.

Description: 
The following is a quote from Eating Well, my favorite health magazine, Even if increasing your fiber intake is the only dietary change you make, you'll shed pounds. Dieters who were told to get at least 30 grams of fiber a day, but given no other dietary parameters, lost a significant amount of weight. In fact, they lost nearly as much as a group put on a much more complex diet that required limiting calories, fat, sugar and salt and upping fruit, veggie and whole-grain consumption. This salad is very high in fiber.
