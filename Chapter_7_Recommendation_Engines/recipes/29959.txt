Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds
salt to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, halved and sliced
4 medium tomatoes, sliced
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup dry bread crumbs for topping
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season the eggplant slices with salt, and let stand for about 10 minutes. Drain off liquid.
Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the eggplant slices on each side.
Place a layer of the eggplant slices in an 8 inch square baking dish or casserole dish. Place some tomato slices over the eggplant, and then a few slices of onion. Repeat layers until you run out of eggplant. Pour balsamic vinegar over everything. In a small bowl, stir together the bread crumbs and remaining olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Spread in a layer over the vegetables.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is golden brown and the eggplant is tender.
