Ingredients:
1/4 C. Olive Oil
1/4 C. Flour
2 t. Salt
2 t. ground Black Pepper
4 lbs. stewing Beef
4 lbs. Vidalia Onions, peeled and roughly chopped
5 cloves of Garlic, roughly chopped
4 large Bay Leaves
4 T. Coarse Grain Mustard
1 T. Prepared Horse Radish
48 Oz. Guinness (or your favourite Stout)

Directions:
Place the Oil in a deep-sided sauce pan and preheat to medium-high.
Mix together the Flour, Salt, and Pepper, and dredge the beef cubes in it.  Place the cubes in the flour, and fry until crisped on all sides,  turning occasionally, remove from flour.
Add the onions and garlic to the oil, and fry until just turning golden-brown.  Add the oil, and stir until a golden roux forms.
Place the onion-roux and the beef chunks in a slow cooker, along with all of the other ingredients.  Cook on high for 4 hours.  Salt and pepper to taste.  If it's too think, made a slurry of 1 Cup of cold water and a tablespoon or two of cornstarch.  Add to slow cooker, and cook for an additional half an hour.  Re-season, if necessary, remove the bay leaves, and serve.

Description: 
This is not a truly traditional carbonnade, but rather a version I came up with, using ingredients from home.  I hope you like it!
