Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon prepared hot mustard
2 dashes chipotle hot sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup port wine
1/2 cup black sesame seeds

Directions:
In the container of a food processor, combine the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, horseradish, hot mustard, chipotle sauce, garlic and port wine. Pulse until smooth. You can use a potato masher in a large bowl but it will take longer.
Line a bowl with plastic wrap, and fill with the cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
Toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat just until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Gather the plastic wrap around the cheese mixture and form into a ball. Remove the plastic wrap and roll the ball in sesame seeds to coat. Place in the center of a platter and surround with your favorite chips or crackers.

Description: 
Serve this black cheese ball with blue corn chips or dark rye toast for a ghastly presentation. It's punchy, just like you'd expect cheese of the dead to taste. You can find black sesame seeds at a reasonable price at most Asian markets.
