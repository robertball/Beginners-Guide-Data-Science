Ingredients:
2 cooked chicken breast halves, chopped
1/2 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
2 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Ocean Spray® Craisins®)
1/4 green apple, shredded
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 pinch salt and black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed

Directions:
Mix together the chicken and mayonnaise in a bowl, stir to coat well, then stir in the green onions, dried cranberries, apple, pecans, lime juice, salt, pepper, and dill weed. Serve immediately, or refrigerate several hours or overnight (the flavor just gets better).

Description: 
This is a great sandwich filling that they make at the diner in the hospital where I work, but I fancied it up a bit with some green onions and pecans. A great way to use up leftover chicken. Delicious!
