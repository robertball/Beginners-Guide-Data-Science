Ingredients:
8 (3/4-inch thick) salmon steaks
1 cup chicken broth
1 small onion, thickly sliced
4 sprigs fresh parsley
4 slices lemon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Sauce:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons finely chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
Rinse salmon and pat dry.
Combine chicken broth, onion, parsley, lemon, salt, and pepper in a large skillet. Bring to a boil. Add salmon to the skillet in a single layer. Bring back to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove salmon from the skillet and keep warm.
Strain cooking liquid and reserve 2 cups.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, dill, sugar, and salt. Cook until bubbling, about 1 minute. Add reserved cooking liquid. Cook, whisking constantly, until sauce begins to thicken.
Slowly stir 1/2 cup sauce into the egg yolks. Pour back into the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not boil. Stir in lemon juice. Spoon sauce over salmon. Serve remaining sauce alongside.
