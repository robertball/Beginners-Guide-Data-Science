Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds assorted tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup Pinot Grigio wine
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
3 ounces tomato paste
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant but not brown, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, wine, water, basil, tomato paste, sugar, pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cover, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes.
Remove from the heat and puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth, or blend in batches in a blender. Return to the heat, stir in Parmesan cheese, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I attempted to make spicy tomato sauce out of fresh tomatoes and this soup is the result. We think it is a winner. If you simmer this for an additional 45 minutes, not covered, you will get a thick spicy sauce. This soup tastes great frozen and reheated.
