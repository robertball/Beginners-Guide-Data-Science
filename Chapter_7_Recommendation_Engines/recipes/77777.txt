Ingredients:
1 pound scallops, rinsed and patted dry
1 cup French dressing
1/2 clove garlic, crushed

Directions:
Cut scallops into quarters, unless they are tiny bay scallops which may be left whole. Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add scallops, and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.
Drain, and place them into a jar while hot. Pour in the French dressing, and add the garlic. Screw the lid onto the jar, and shake to coat. Refrigerate until chilled to marinate. Drain and serve with toothpicks.
