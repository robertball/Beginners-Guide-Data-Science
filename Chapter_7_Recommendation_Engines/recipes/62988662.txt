Ingredients:
1-2 NAVAL ORANGES QUARTED
2 LARGE GALA APPLES QUARTED AND CHOPPED
1 CUP PACKED DARK BROWN SUGAR
1 CUP OF SALT
1 PINT OF WHISKEY (I USE JACK DANIELS)
1-2 CLOVES OF JUMBO SIZED GARLIC
1 FIVE-GALLON BUCKET
12-18 LB TURKEY
2 QUARTS OF APPLE JUICE (NON CONCENTRATE)
1 LEMON OR ¼ CUP LEMON EXTRACT
Ice (usually a bag or little less)
(You can add different herbs if you choose but I like the above and then season while roasting turkey)

Directions:
First things first prep turkey, rinse, and take out giblets (hold for gravy or dressin
now for the brine
First take a small pot and with 2 ½ cups water and 1-cup salt bring to boil STIR CONSTANTLY boil for 3 minutes.
Add this to the bucket and fill with about 1 gallon of water (depending on size of turkey)
Rinse small pot add 2 ½ cups of water and 1 cup of brown sugar, bring to boil stirring constantly. Add to bucket
Add whiskey
Make sure you keep this stirred up as you add mixtures so it doesn’t settle to bottom before you add to turkey
Now add 2 quarts apple juice
Add the lemon or lemon extract
Now I take one apple and chop each quarter in two pieces and stuff into turkey the other goes into the brine
Add the sliced oranges… I like squeezing the juice into the brine and dropping the rhines into the brine as well
Crush the garlic into a paste rub into/onto turkey (don’t worry the brine will extract most of it off the turkey)
Now if you are going to use herbs I suggest fresh herbs minced rubbed on over the garlic. The garlic will help herbs adhere to turkey and absorb into meat.
Place your masterpiece of a turkey in an awesome brine
Now you can place this into your fridge but it is very heavy so I like to take the ice and add it occasionally just to keep it fridge cold not freezer cold.
Let it set from 12 to 16 hours once again depending on the size of the turkey
At the end of this time period take out turkey pat dry with paper towels

Description: 
I mixed and matched and finally found the best way to brine a turkey. It add's flavor but not enough to overpower what you will use when you roast the turkey. It will LEAK WHEN YOU CUT IT literally... that is how juicy this bird gets'
