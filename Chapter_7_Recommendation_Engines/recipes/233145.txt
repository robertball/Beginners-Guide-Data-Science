Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 (9 inch) frozen deep dish pie crust, thawed
1/2 cup diced white onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup sour cream
4 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble. Reserve about 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in the skillet.
Cook and stir onion and garlic in reserved bacon drippings over medium heat until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place thawed pie crust in a pie dish; prick holes in the bottom and sides of crust using a fork.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Remove crust from oven and reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk half-and-half and sour cream together in a bowl; beat eggs into half-and-half mixture. Mix Swiss cheese, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into half-and-half mixture; add bacon, onion mixture, and parsley. Pour mixture into the crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, about 45 to 50 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before slicing into wedges.

Description: 
I discovered quiche Lorraine while studying French in high school. After trying many recipes over the years and being dissatisfied with each one I have put my own spin on this classic recipe that results in a crisp crust and tender custard. Serve with a side salad if desired. Bon appetite!
