Description: 
My memere makes these every Christmas. It's such a special treat. I hated them when I was younger, because the word dates just signified something gross for old people. Now that I'm older I can't get enough of them, and my daughter loves them too. It's the perfect mix of tender fruit and crunchy oatmeal, salty butter and sweet dates. You'll love them!
