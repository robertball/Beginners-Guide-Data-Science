Ingredients:
1 cup natural peanut butter
1 cup hot water
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup tamari
1/4 cup molasses
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
In a small saucepan, whisk together peanut butter and water over low heat.  Stir in vinegar, tamari, molasses, and cayenne pepper.  Heat through, but do not simmer or boil; cooking can cause the sauce to curdle.
