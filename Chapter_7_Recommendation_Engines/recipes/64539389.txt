Ingredients:
3 cups sugar
2 sticks butter, softened
1 cup peanut butter (plain or chunky)
2 Tablespoons molasses
1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract
big pinch baking powder
2 teaspoons kosher salt (1 - 1 1/2 tsp table)
3 very ripe bananas
2 1/2 cups AP flour
1 pkg chocolate chips
3/4 cup broken pretzel sticks
10 bacon strips, cooked crisp and chopped fine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F .
In a big bowl, cream the sugar, butter, peanut butter, molasses, vanilla, baking powder and salt until well blended.  Add the bananas and mix till thoroughly combined and no lumps.
Add the flour and gently mix until incorporated.
Fold in chips, pretzels and bacon.
Drop small spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart. Place in fridge to chill for 10 minutes.
Bake for 12 minutes or until golden on the outside and gooey in the middle.
Let cool on wire rack.
Cookies will be slightly carmelized on the bottom and gooey in the middle.
I made these small - about 1 1/2 - 2 inches in diameter.
