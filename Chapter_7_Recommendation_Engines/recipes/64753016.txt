Ingredients:
3 cup of powdered sugar
1/2 cup of softened butter
2 tsp of vanilla
1-2 tbsp of milk

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and butter with spoon or electric mixer on low speed. Stir in vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the milk.
Gradually beat in just enough remaining milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable. If frosting is too thick, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time. If frosting becomes too thin, beat in a small amount of powdered sugar.
