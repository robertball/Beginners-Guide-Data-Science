Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup beer
3 large onions, sliced into rings
1 cup oil for frying

Directions:
In a shallow bowl combine flour, egg, parsley, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper.  Gradually add beer, stirring, until a thick batter forms.  Add more or less beer depending on the desired consistency of the batter.
In a heavy frying pan heat oil (adjust amount, depending on the size of your pan, so that you have a couple of inches of oil) over medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, dip onions in batter and fry, turning once to brown evenly on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
Beer battered onion rings - my mother-in-law taught me this. You can actually use this batter for a lot of things, like zucchini, eggplant, jalapenos, etc.
