Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon minced onion
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
2 tablespoons butter, softened
3 tablespoons cracker crumbs, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Unroll crescent roll dough onto a work surface; make 4 rectangles by placing 2 dough triangles next to each other. Pinch perforations closed.
Mix cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, salt, black pepper, milk, and minced onion in a bowl until evenly combined; gently stir chicken into cream cheese mixture. Spoon 1/4 the chicken mixture onto each dough rectangle. Roll dough over the filling and pinch seams closed. Place onto a baking sheet. Spread about 1 1/2 teaspoons butter on each pocket and sprinkle with cracker crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and filling is hot, 20 to 25 minutes.
