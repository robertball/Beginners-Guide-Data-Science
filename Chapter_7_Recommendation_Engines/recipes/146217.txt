Ingredients:
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 teaspoon dried basil
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch ground cumin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts, basil, pepper, and cumin.  Place the chicken breasts on a flat surface, and cut from one side through the middle of the breast to within one half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out flat like an open book. Spread the chicken with the ricotta mixture, and roll up. Place the rolls in prepared baking dish, seam side down.
Bake in preheated oven until juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing and serving.

Description: 
A delicious spin on Italian cuisine, this recipe is really easy to follow and always turns out great. You can serve the chicken over your favorite pasta with your favorite sauce. My favorite sauce to serve with this dish is a creamy pesto.
