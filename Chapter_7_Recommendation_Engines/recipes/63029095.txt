Ingredients:
1/2 pound imported Swiss cheese, shredded
1/2 pound Gruyere cheese, shredded
2 Tbsp cornstarch
1 garlic clove, peeled
1 cup dry white wine
1 Tbsp  lemon juice
1 Tbsp  cherry brandy, such as kirsch
1/2 tsp dry mustard
Pinch nutmeg
Assorted dippers

Directions:
In a small bowl, coat the cheeses with cornstarch and set aside. Rub the inside of the ceramic fondue pot with the garlic, then discard.
Over medium heat, add the wine and lemon juice and bring to a gentle simmer. Gradually stir the cheese into the simmering liquid. Melting the cheese gradually encourages a smooth fondue. Once smooth, stir in cherry brandy, mustard and nutmeg.
Arrange an assortment of bite-sized dipping foods on a lazy Susan around fondue pot. Serve with chunks of French and pumpernickel breads. Some other suggestions are Granny Smith apples and blanched vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and asparagus. Spear with fondue forks or wooden skewers, dip, swirl and enjoy!
