Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
2 eggs
1 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded
2 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
3/4 cup blue cheese, crumbled
(or use a good Blue cheese dressing instead of Ranch)
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
3 green onions, chopped
1 (8 ounce) bottle Ranch-style salad dressing

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool completely, peel and chop.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.  (Pre-cooked bacon okay as substitute)
Divide shredded lettuce among individual plates.
Evenly divide and arrange chicken, eggs, tomatoes, blue cheese, bacon, avocado and green onions in a row on top of the lettuce.
Drizzle with your favorite dressing and enjoy.
