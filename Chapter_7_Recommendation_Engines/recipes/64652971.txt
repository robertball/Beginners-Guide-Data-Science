Ingredients:
1 16 oz package jumbo pasta shells
2 cups small curd cottage cheese
8 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp Italian seasoning
1 (26 oz or larger) jar high quality spaghetti sauce
1/4 cup parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook shells according to package directions.  Rinse in cool water and drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Mix together cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, eggs and seasonings.  Place mixture into a gallon size ziploc bag.  Cut off about  a dime size corner of the bag, and pipe contents into shells.
Spread a thin layer of sauce into bottom of baking pan.  Place shells, open side up, into pan, nestled closely together.  Spread remaining sauce on top, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.
Cover pan with tin foil and bake for 20 minutes.  Remove tin foil and cook an additional ten minutes or until bubbly. Let stand for a few minutes before serving.
