Ingredients:
3 eggs, separated
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (4 ounce) package Parmesan cheese, finely grated
3/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup rice flour
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until firm, but not stiff.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until creamy. Mix in egg yolks until well blended. Mix in Parmesan cheese gradually. Add sour cream and baking powder; beat until batter is smooth.
Sift rice flour over batter; fold in with a spatula. Fold in egg whites with the spatula.
Pour batter into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 38 minutes.

Description: 
Quesadilla Salvadorena is a moist, sweet, cheese pound cake. The key to this recipe is the type of cheese used, Parmesan cheese. I invented this recipe to match the pre-made quesadilla you find at the grocery stores. Buen provecho!
