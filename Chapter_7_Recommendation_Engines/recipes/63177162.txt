Ingredients:
12 medium baby bella mushrooms (each about 2 inches wide), stems chopped and reserved
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
1 tbsp. diced jarred jalapeño slices (about 5 slices)
1/4 tsp. chopped garlic
3 tbsp. precooked real crumbled bacon (like the kind by Oscar Mayer)
2 tbsp. shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese
2 tbsp. fat-free cream cheese, room temperature
1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/8 tsp. each salt and black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Place mushroom caps on the sheet, rounded sides down. Bake until tender, 12 - 14 minutes. Leave oven on.
Meanwhile, bring a skillet sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat. Add chopped mushroom stems, bell pepper, jalapeño, and garlic. Cook and stir until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and blot away excess moisture. Stir in all remaining ingredients.
Blot away excess moisture from mushroom caps. Evenly distribute cheesy veggie mixture among the mushroom caps. Bake until filling is hot, 8 - 10 minutes. Eat up!
