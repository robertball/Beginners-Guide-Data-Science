Ingredients:
1/4 c butter, melted
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses
1/3 cup condensed tomato soup
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the melted butter, sugar, and egg until smooth. Stir in the molasses and soup. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger; blend into the molasses mixture. Cover, and chill dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll dough into 2 1/2 tablespoon sizes, and roll them in the remaining white sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake for 10-12 minutes in the preheated oven, until tops spring back lightly when pressed. Cool on pan for 3 minutes, then on wire racks.

Description: 
I once suggested tomato soup cookies, and my mom challenged me to create them. Instead, I came up with these muffin tops, which have a deep and spicy flavor. Plus, they are low in fat and high in lycopene!
