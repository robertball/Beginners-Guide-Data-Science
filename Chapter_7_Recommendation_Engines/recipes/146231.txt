Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 (1 1/2-pound) beef flank steak
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 (13.75 ounce) can chicken broth
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 whole cloves

Directions:
Mix the flour and garlic powder together in a shallow dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Dip the steak in the flour mixture evenly coating both sides. Set aside. Discard remaining flour mixture.
Heat the cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place the steak in the skillet and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes for each side. Stir in the chicken broth, lemon juice, garlic, and cloves. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer until steak is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
To serve, remove steak from the skillet, and slice across the grain in thin strips. Place on serving plates, and ladle sauce over meat.

Description: 
This is one of my mother's best recipes from my childhood. Flank steak was cheap back then, so feel free to substitute chuck steak or flap meat. The ingredients are simple but very flavorful. It's excellent with buttered noodles or white beans, and a green vegetable such as broccoli or asparagus.
