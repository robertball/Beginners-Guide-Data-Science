Ingredients:
2 or 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon rosemary
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Mix flour with salt and pepper.
Dredge the chicken breasts with flour.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Cook the chicken in the hot oil until it is brown on both sides.
Add the rosemary and garlic to the pan, stirring for 1 minute.
Add the wine vinegar and cook for 3 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan.
Cover pan and turn heat to low.
Cook for approximately 30 minutes, or until chicken juices are no longer pink when cut with a knife.
While cooking, add a little water to the pan if liquid is gone.

Description: 
Wonderfully aromatic rosemary chicken that's easy to make.  We like to serve this with buttered pasta topped with parmesan cheese.
