Description: 
This recipe is something I will whip together on nights when spaghetti just won't cut it, but time is a commodity worth more than gold. There are only two in my family, but that just means plenty of yummy leftovers. Serve this chili with cheese on top and a thick slice of homemade sourdough bread and you've got a winner. The measurements are approximations since I'm more of a shake and dab type of cook, but this is generally right. This gives more kick than you might think, so be lenient with the pepper flakes if you are serving kids!
