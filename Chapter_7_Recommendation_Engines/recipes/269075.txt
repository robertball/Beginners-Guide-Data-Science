Ingredients:
1 cup lukewarm milk
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 large egg
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups bread flour, or more as needed
3/4 cup chocolate chips
3/4 cup dried cherries

Directions:
Mix milk and yeast in a small bowl with a fork until frothy, about 5 minutes. Add egg, butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup flour. Beat for about 5 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups flour; mix until dough comes together.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until dough is smooth and feels rubbery, about 10 minutes. Add additional flour if needed. Add chocolate chips and cherries; knead just until incorporated.
Cover dough and let rise in a warm, humid area until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch down dough gently. Let rest for 10 minutes. Divide dough in half; shape into loaves. Transfer loaves to a greased baking sheet and let rise again, about 1 hour more.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
My friend gave me this recipe 15 years ago and it has been a favorite ever since. We prefer sweet, as opposed to tart, dried cherries. You can also use dried cranberries.
