Ingredients:
1 bunch celery, cleaned and cut into 4 inch pieces

Directions:
Arrange the celery in a single layer on the bottom of a large skillet.  Season with salt and pepper. Dot with butter. Dissolve the bouillon cube in boiling water, and pour over the celery.
Cover pan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.
