Ingredients:
3 lbs cubed steak
1-2 tbs of margarine or shortening
flour
2-3 cans of stewed tomatoes
1 package of onion soup mix
black pepper to taste
chopped tomatoes with chilis (optional)
garlic (optional)
bag of egg (or any kind of) noodles

Directions:
melt 1-2 tbs of margarine or shortening in dutch oven
take one piece of cubed steak at a time and sprinkle both sides with a little flour. Pound out the piece of cubed steak until it is thin and cut into 2-3 pieces.
Place pieces of cubed steak into the dutch oven and quickly brown on both sides, then take out and keep warm on a plate.
When all pieces of cubed steak are browned, put them all back in the dutch oven, add your stewed tomatoes, chopped tomatoes with chilis, garlic, onion soup mix and black pepper.
simmer until meat is tender. The time will depend on how thin you pounded out the pieces of cubed steak.
Serve over a bed of hot noodles.
**If you choose to cook this in the crock pot, after all pieces of meat are browned, place in the crock pot with the other ingredients, cook on low the entire day or through the night if you prefer.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my mom gave to me that I modified a bit. Everyone loves it and it is great when you want something good but don't have a lot of time to prepair. It is also inexpensive to make and also be cooked in a crock pot rather than on the stove top.
