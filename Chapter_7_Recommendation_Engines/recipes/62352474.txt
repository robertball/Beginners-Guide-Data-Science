Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
2 lbs. spicy sausage
1 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
2 (16 ounce) can pinto beans
3 (16 ounce) can baked beans
1 green apple, peeled, grated
3/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown.  Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of drippings, crumble and set aside in a large bowl.  Cook the onion, sausage and garlic in the reserved drippings until onion is tender; drain excess grease and transfer to the bowl with the bacon.
To the bacon and onions add all the beans. Stir in apple, ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and black pepper.  Mix well and transfer to a 9x12 inch casserole dish.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour or in a crock pot on low for 6-8 hours.
