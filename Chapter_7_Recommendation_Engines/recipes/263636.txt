Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almond milk
1 1/3 cups spelt flour
2 tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon water, or more as needed

Directions:
Pour milk into a blender. Add flour, oil, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt. Blend for a few seconds until combined. Scrape flour off the sides and continue blending until smooth. Cover and refrigerate batter, 8 hours to overnight.
Blend water into the batter to restore the consistency.
Preheat oven to the lowest setting; place a plate inside.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour a portion of the batter into the middle of the ungreased skillet. Cook until pancake starts to set and darken in color, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Place on the plate in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
These vegan pancakes are amazing and sweet! And if you don't want to bother with a lot of dishes this is a good recipe because you use the blender! Plus, you don't have to get up early to make them; make the night before and store in fridge. Gently stir fruit into the batter before cooking, if desired.
