Ingredients:
3/4 cup warm water (100 to 105 degrees F/38 to 41 degrees C)
3/4 teaspoon coconut sugar
3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil (such as Kasandrino's®)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt (such as Redmond® Real Salt)
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning (optional)
2/3 cup cassava flour (such as Otto's®), or more as needed
1/4 cup arrowroot starch
3/4 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
1 tablespoon arrowroot starch, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine warm water, coconut sugar, and yeast in a large glass measuring cup; let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 4 to 6 minutes. Stir olive oil, sea salt, and Italian seasoning into yeast mixture.
Whisk cassava flour, 1/4 cup arrowroot starch, and gelatin together in a bowl; pour into the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon. Add more cassava flour, a few tablespoons at a time, if dough is too sticky. Divide dough into 4 portions and roll into balls, gently kneading each one as you form it.
Dust a piece of parchment paper with about 1/4 tablespoon arrowroot starch and place 1 dough ball on it. Dust with more arrowroot and place a second piece of parchment on top. Roll dough into a 4-inch circle. Roll it to a 5-inch circle for crisper pita chips. Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and arrowroot starch.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully cut each circle into 8 wedges. Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Flip each wedges and bake until edges are golden and chips are crisp, 5 to 8 minutes.
