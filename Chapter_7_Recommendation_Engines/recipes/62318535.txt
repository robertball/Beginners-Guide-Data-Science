Salmon Filet with Capers and Vinegar Recipe

Ingredients:
- 100gms (3 1/2 ounces) Butter, used in two lots of 50 gms.
- 2 Salmon Filets, each around 150 gms (5 1/4 ounces)
- 4 Tablespoons Sherry Vinegar; you can use other wine vinegars, but trust me, sherry vinegar is so RIGHT for this.
- 1 Tablepoon Capers, well rinsed
- A small handful of Fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Have the serving plates warm.
Melt half the butter in a shallow pan over medium heat.
When it begins to go frothy, add the salmon filets skin side down.
Cook for around 3 minutes. We want the skin golden brown and just crisp.
Turn the filets over, and make sure the heat is not too high.
Another 2 minutes and the fish will be cooked through, with the flesh just getting golden patches.
Carefully lift the filets out of the pan and onto the warmed plates.
Working quickly, empty out the fishy butter from the pan, wipe out the pan with kitchen paper (don't burn yourself!) and drop the remining butter in as you return the pan to the heat.
When the butter froths up, watch very carefully. We want a golden nutty brown colour. It is so easy to suddenly change from brown to black here, so be careful, or you will have start again.
When the butter is golden, pour in the vinegar and let it hiss and spit at you.
Toss in the capers and the parsley and warm through, shaking the pan a bit. (Hot capers can release almost overpowering strength - the bullies - we don't want that!)
Pour over the filets and serve.
