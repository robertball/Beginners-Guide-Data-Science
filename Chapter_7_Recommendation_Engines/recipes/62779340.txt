Ingredients:
12 ounces good quality bologna, sliced
12 ounces room temperature cream cheese (one and one half blocks)
½ package dry ranch salad dressing mix
1 can aerosol cheese, sharp cheddar flavor
Garnish:
1 sliced pimiento stuffed olive, a few slivers of green onion tops or few parsley leaves
Buttery flavor crackers for serving

Directions:
In a medium bowl and with a spatula combine the dry ranch dressing mix with cream cheese until well blended.
Place the first slice of bologna on a medium serving plate. Spread about a teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture evenly over the top of the bologna. Place another slice of bologna on top and repeat until all of the bologna slices have been used.
Spread the remaining cream cheese over the top and sides, as if icing a real cake. Squirt dollops of the aerosol cheese around the base of the “cake” and around the upper rim. Garnish as desired with olives, parsley or green onions.
To serve, place a very thin, sharp knife on the plate for guests to slice thin wedges. Place on top of a buttery-style cracker (Townhouse or Ritz).
Serves 10-12
