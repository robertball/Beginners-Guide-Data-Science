Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
6 tablespoons shortening
4 eggs
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F).  Grease 2 baking sheets.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, and baking powder.  Cut in the vegetable shortening  until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs until thick and light-colored.  Gradually beat the eggs into the flour mixture.  Fold in the walnuts.
On a floured surface, roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick.  Using a cookie cutter, cut into desired shapes and place 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until lightly colored.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.
