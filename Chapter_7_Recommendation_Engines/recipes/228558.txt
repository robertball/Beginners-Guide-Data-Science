Ingredients:
8 Black Mission figs, cut in half
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese, or as needed
3 slices prosciutto, trimmed of all fat and cut into strips
2 tablespoons honey, or to taste

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Arrange fig halves, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Top each fig half with goat cheese; lay prosciutto strips atop goat cheese layer.
Broil figs in the preheated oven until prosciutto is crisp and goat cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer the warm figs to a serving platter and drizzle with honey.

Description: 
When I lived in California, I couldn't wait until the farmer's markets had figs...big, juicy, amazing to eat! They are hard to find in Colorado, and are less flavorful than the ones in CA. So I came up with this little appetizer to showcase some of my favorite ingredients.
