Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup of shortening
cup of ice cold water
About 1 cup blueberries
3 tbs of sugar
2 tbs lemon juice
Pie pan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together flour and salt. Cut in shortening using a fork until they are the size of peas. Add about 4 tbs. of ice cold water to the dough. Use more or less depending on the consistency. Flour your hands and mix the dough, but not too much or the dough will be hard when baked. If you want a lattice pie top, take part of the dough and put back in the bowl for later use. On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it fits the size of your pie pan.
Grease the pan and put the dough in the dish. Trim off excess dough from the edges. In a seperate bowl, add the washed blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Stir until blueberries are coated. Pour blueberries into the pie and spread evenly. Now, if you want a lattice top, roll out the dough and using a knife, cut strips from the dough and start putting them on the pie until it looks checkered. Put into the oven for 20-30 minutes until the pie crust goldens and the blueberry juice bubbles. Enjoy with cold vanilla ice cream.

This is my favorite pie to make! My aunt taught me how to make this from scratch and the recipe never fails. Freshly picked blueberries make it taste even better.
