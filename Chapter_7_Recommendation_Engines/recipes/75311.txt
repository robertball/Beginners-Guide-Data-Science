Ingredients:
6 ears corn, husked and cleaned
1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1/2 red onion, diced
1 medium tomato, diced
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the corn in a large pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook 5 minutes, until kernels are tender but crisp. Drain, cool slightly, and use a knife to scrape kernels from the cobs.
In a large bowl, mix the corn kernels, red bell pepper, onion, tomato, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Season with pepper. Chill 15 minutes before serving.
