Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
2 teaspoons lard
1/2 cucumber - peeled, seeded, and minced
2 cups cooked rice, chilled and broken apart
1/4 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)

Directions:
Beat eggs with 1 pinch salt in a bowl until frothy.
Heat lard in a skillet over medium heat; cook eggs, stirring with a wooden spoon to break into small pieces, until set, about 5 minutes. Add cucumber; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix rice into egg mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until rice is heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with remaining salt and MSG.
