Ingredients:
3 eggs
3 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons butter
2 potatoes, cubed
1/2 cup cubed fully cooked ham
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/4 cup water, or as needed (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Beat eggs and milk in a bowl.
Melt butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir potatoes, ham, onion, and garlic in melted butter until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add water if vegetables become dry. Season with salt and pepper.
Pour egg mixture over vegetable mixture. Cook, without stirring, until eggs are slightly browned on the bottom.
Broil in the preheated oven until eggs are nearly set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over eggs and continue broiling until frittata is completely set and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Feel free to experiment with this original recipe by me. Yummy sauteed meat, potatoes, veggies, with eggs. Ingredient measures are approximate. I had to guess how much I used as I put things in as I went. Love an ingredient, ADD MORE! Don't like one much, ADD LESS! Very versatile recipe.
