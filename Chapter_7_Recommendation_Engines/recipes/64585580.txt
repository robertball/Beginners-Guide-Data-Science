Ingredients:
7 tsp canola oil, divided
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup finely chopped peeled carrot
3 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 cup water
1/3 cup uncooked quinoa
1/2 cup panko
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups canned unsalted chickpeas, rinsed and drained
2 Tbsp hot sauce
4 (1.5-oz) whole-wheat hamburger buns, toasted
4 romaine lettuce leaves
4 (1/4-inch-thick) slices tomato

Directions:
Heat saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons oil; swirl to coat. Add onion, carrot, and garlic; saute 3 minutes. Add 3/4 cup water and quinoa; bring to a boil.
Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 18 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Spoon cooked quinoa onto large plate; cool 5 minutes.
Combine quinoa mixture, panko, salt, pepper, chickpeas, and egg in food processor; pulse until chickpeas are slightly mashed and mixture comes together. Shape mixture into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties.
Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add patties; cook 3 minutes per side or until lightly browned.
Combine remaining 2 teaspoons oil and hot sauce in bowl. Place patties on bottom halves of buns; top evenly with hot sauce mixture, lettuce, tomato, and bun tops.
