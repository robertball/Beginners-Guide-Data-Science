Ingredients:
4-5 BIG rainbow carrots (about 9 inches in length)
1 tbs organic cornstarch
a big dash of each: cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, oregano, and thyme
2 tsp coconut sugar (or brown sugar)
2 tbs olive oil

Directions:
preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Cut the carrots into thin fry sticks, about 1/4? x 1/4? thick. You know what fries look like. Place them in a big bowl.
Sprinkle the corn starch over the cut carrots and give them a quick toss with your hands to coat them.
sprinkle the spices evenly over the carrots, then drizzle them with the olive oil.
Spread the carrot fries out evenly on a greased baking sheet. (I used more olive oil.) Don’t crowd them or else they will steam instead of bake.
Pop them in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, turning once half way through.
You can keep an eye on them toward the end and adjust your cooking time for softer or crunchier fries.
Eat them right away, they soften after too long out of the oven. Be warned, you will be done in 3 minutes flat, you might want to make a double batch, they are so addictive!

Description: 
The secret ingredient to crispy carrot (or sweet potato fries) is a little bit of organic corn starch! Too much and they will be pasty, too little and they won’t get as crispy. My favorite way to eat these is with a little ketchup mixed with Sriracha (a 4:1 ratio.) You can just buy a pre-made Cajun seasoning at the store (easy), or make your own by combining the spices listed.
