Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ground beef
2 cups salsa
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups shell pasta
2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add salsa, corn, and taco seasoning. Season meat sauce with salt and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
Combine the meat sauce, pasta, Colby-Jack cheese, and green onions in a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 25 minutes.
