Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons golden syrup
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine the butter, honey and golden syrup in a saucepan. Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until butter is melted and ingredients are blended. Stir in the baking soda, and remove from the heat.
Measure the flour and sugar into a mixing bowl and stir to blend. Pour the butter mixture into the bowl with the flour, and stir until evenly blended. Roll the dough into 1 inch balls, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
