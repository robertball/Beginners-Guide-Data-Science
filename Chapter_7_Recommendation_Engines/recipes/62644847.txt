Ingredients:
2 TB olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2 ribs celery, diced
1/2 sweet red pepper, diced
10 oz. fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 TB flour
1 cup low sodium chicken broth
1 box (usually 13.25 oz) whole grain rotini or other pasta
1 can cream of mushroom soup
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 cup frozen peas
2 TB grated parmesan or romano cheese

Directions:
Cook the pasta according to package directions, drain, reserving 1/2 c. liquid for the sauce.
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large frying pan or dutch oven.  Gently saute the onion, celery, and pepper until translucent.  Add the mushrooms, toss.  Sprinkle vegetable mixture with the flour, stir until flour begins to congeal and cook, add broth and stir.  The mixture will begin to thicken, reduce heat and cover.  Cook over low heat 10 minutes.
Stir in the mushroom soup, reserved pasta cooking liquid, peas and chicken.  Stir until blended.
Mix pasta and sauce together in a 2 qt. casserole dish.   Top with parmesan cheese.
Bake, covered, in 325 degree oven for 25 minutes.  Uncover the last few minutes of cooking.
