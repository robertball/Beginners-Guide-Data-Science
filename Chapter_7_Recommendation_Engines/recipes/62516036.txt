Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, chopped
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup (60 mL) balsamic vinegar
2 tsp. (10 mL) Dijon mustard
2 Tbsp. (30 mL) olive oil
1 lb. (500 g) fresh spinach, washed and spun dry, or a bag of washed baby spinach leaves
Salt and pepper
Poached eggs (optional)

Directions:
In a large skillet set over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Transfer it to paper towels to drain any excess fat. Drain all but 2 Tbsp. (30 mL) of the bacon fat from the skillet; add the onion and cook until it’s beginning to turn golden. Add the vinegar and mustard and stir until it’s well blended. Bring the mixture to a boil, remove it from the heat, and stir in the oil.
Put the spinach into a bowl and pour the warm vinaigrette on top. Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it on top. Add salt and pepper and toss to coat the greens well. Serve immediately. Serves 4.

Description: 
Spinach is fantastic wilted, and because it’s less bulky you can get more of it into you that way. Try serving this salad topped with a poached egg, so that the yolk breaks and mingles with the dressing, and crusty bread.
