Ingredients:
1 head lettuce
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese
2 tablespoons blue cheese
2 tablespoons diced carrots
1 tablespoon minced green pepper
2 tablespoons diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons diced side bacon
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon minced onion

Directions:
Wash lettuce; remove core.
With a tablespoon, remove enough of the lettuce around core to leave a cavity 2 to 3 in diameter.
Save removed lettuce for another use.
Serve with additional crisp vegetables or fruit on the side
Combine cheeses, carrot, green pepper, tomato, pepper, salt and onion, pack firmly into lettuce cavity.
Wrap lettuce head in foil or plastic wrap and chill until center is solid.
Slice lettuce into wedges (4).
Serve with dressing of your choice.
A few pieces of fresh fruit (grapes, strawberries or melon) placed on the salad plate is very nice.

Description: 
This is so easy and so pretty. It makes a nice summer lunch, just add some fruit. I used Kraft Fig Balsamic for Dinner Club but any dressing will do.
