Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1 medium red onion, chopped
2 medium carrots, cut 1/4 inch thick
1 large celery stalk, diced
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary, or 1/4 teaspoon dried
1 can (20 oz) diced tomatoes
1 large potato, peeled and diced
1 bunch kale, tough stems removed, thinly sliced
1 can (15 oz) cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
coarse salt and ground pepper
Parmesan cheese, for serving

Directions:
In a 6-quart casserole, heat olive oil over medium. Add onion, carrots, celery, rosemary, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to turn golden, about 8 minutes.
Add tomatoes, cook until some of the liquid evaporates, 2 minutes. Add potato, kale, cannellini beans, and 7 cups water; bring to a boil. Stir in green beans.
Reduce to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and serve with grated Parmesan cheeese.
