Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
1 large spoonful of light mayo
1 or 2 tbsp of your favorite oil
1 heaping 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 heaping 1/2 tsp onion powder
1 heaping 1/2 tsp parsley
1/8 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp salt
1 tbsp white vinegar

Directions:
Mix together the above ingredients using a beater. Enjoy.
Feel free to suggest modifications to the recipe.
I used potassium salt and a vegetable oil that was 80% canola, 20% extra virgin olive oil. I use hellmanns canola oil mayonnaise as well.  My goal was to make a dressing high in potassium and that has more omega 9 fatty acids and less omega 6 and tasted good.
This is version 1 of the recipe.. I may try to increase certain ingredients for a more potent dressing in future revisions.
