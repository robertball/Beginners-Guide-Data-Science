Ingredients:
Strawberry Cake:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 cup mashed fresh strawberries
1 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup milk
4 eggs
1 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped pecans
Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup fresh strawberries
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round pans.
In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and gelatin mix. Make a well in the center and pour in 1 cup mashed strawberries, oil, milk and eggs. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Fold in the coconut and pecans. Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
To make the Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting: Mash the 3/4 cup strawberries to make 1/2 cup, then drain well; set aside. In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Blend in the confectioners' sugar and drained strawberries. Beat on medium speed until the frosting lightens and is well combined. Fold in the coconut and pecans.
Frost cake between layers, on top and sides. Chill uncovered 30 minutes or until frosting sets, then cover and chill 4 to 6 hours before serving.
