Ingredients:
8 large Granny Smith apples, cored and sliced
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix the apple slices, white sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons of flour, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon together until thoroughly combined; spread out into a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a separate large bowl, mix the melted butter with nutmeg and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon; stir in the brown sugar, oats, 1 cup of flour, and mini marshmallows until thoroughly combined. Spread the marshmallow topping evenly over the apples, and gently flatten the topping to a smooth layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
This may sound a bit strange, but it is really a rich and delicious recipe. The topping forms a soft golden brown crust that is somewhat cookie-like. It compliments the tartness of the apples very well. Enjoy!
