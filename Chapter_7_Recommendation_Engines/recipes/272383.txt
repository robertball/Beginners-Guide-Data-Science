Ingredients:
1 egg
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup sourdough starter
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

Directions:
Add egg, sugar, sourdough starter, flour, and buttermilk to a bowl in the order listed. Mix thoroughly before adding baking soda; batter will be light and bubbly. Do not mix again.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are slightly dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until pancakes sound hollow when tapped with a spatula, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
