Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
2 litres water
4 peppercorns
2.5 cm piece of ginger, sliced
1 onion, quartered
3 sprigs parsley
440g can creamed corn
2 chicken stock cubes
1/2 teaspoon fresh grated ginger, extra
5 green spring onions, chopped (I think you call them scallions)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 tablespoons cornflour
2 egg whites
2 slices ham, thinly sliced
to garnish:
4 spring onions extra, chopped diagonally, Chinese style
to serve (if desired):
soy sauce

Directions:
Place chicken in a large pan, add water, peppercorns, ginger, onion and parsley.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer covered for 1 1/2 hours.  Skim to remove any scum.  Strain and reserve 6 cups stock.  Remove meat from chicken, shred finely.  You will need about 1 1/2 cups finely shredded meat for the soup, reserve the rest for another meal.
Combine chicken stock, corn, stock cubes, extra ginger, shallots and sesame oil in a large pan, bring to the boil.  Combine cornflour with 4 tablespoons cold water and add to soup, stirring until it has boiled and thickened, about a minute.
Lightly beat egg whites with 2 tablespoons of water and add to soup in a thin stream, stirring well.
Add ham and shredded chicken to soup and heat thorugh gently.
Serve garnished with spring onions and pass soy sauce separtely, for a dash of flavour (if desired).
