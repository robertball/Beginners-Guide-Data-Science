Ingredients listed per Baked Apple.
1 Large Red Delicious Apple
1 Tbsp Butter
2 Tbsp Brown Sugar
1 Tbsp Finely Shredded Coconut
1 tsp Cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees.
Scoop out the core of the apple(s), making sure that there are no seeds left. Since you are creating a well to stuff with the other ingredients, be careful that you leave the bottom intact.
In a bowl, mix the butter with the sugar, cinnamon, and coconut.
Fill the center of the apple(s) with your ingredients.
Put them on a baking dish, and place them in the oven for 30 minutes or until tender.
Remove the baked apple(s) from the dish and put them in bowls.
Drizzle any juices from the baking dish over the apples and top them with an extra sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar (optional).
Eat with a knife and fork.
Goes well with vanilla ice cream or alone.
