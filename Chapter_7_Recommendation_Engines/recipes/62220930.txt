Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup chopped walnuts, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lay wax paper on a 11x15 inch cookie sheet.
In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, and pumpkin pie spice. Stir in pumpkin puree, eggs, and lemon juice. Pour mixture into prepared pan. Spread the mixture evenly.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 minutes.
Lay a damp linen towel on the counter, sprinkle it with confectioner's sugar, and turn the cake onto the towel. Carefully roll the towel up (lengthwise) with the cake in it.  Place the cake-in-towel on a cooling rack and let it cool for 20 minutes.
Make the icing: In a medium bowl, blend cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and sugar with a wooden spoon or electric mixer.
When the cake has cooled 20 minutes, unroll it and spread icing onto it.  Immediately re-roll (not in the towel this time), and wrap it with plastic wrap.  Keep the cake refrigerated or freeze it for up to 2 weeks in aluminum foil.  Cut the cake  in slices just before serving.

Description: 
A sweetly spicy, pumpkin-flavored cake is spread with a silky rich cream cheese filling and rolled up like a pinwheel. For easy lifting, line your baking pan with parchment paper. Chill the cake to set before slicing.Modified from: Granny Kat's Pumpkin Roll
