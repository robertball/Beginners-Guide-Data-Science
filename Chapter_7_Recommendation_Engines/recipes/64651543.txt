Description: 
I was inspired to make this grilled calamari with anchovy and capers after my recent trip to Rome.  My husband and I enjoyed anchovy and capers from Tuscany to Rome and since we love fish I decided to create this perfect dish.  We enjoyed with company as a primi and all shared from the plate.  Of course, you can dip fresh bread in the sauce.

I used San Marzano tomatoes from my favorite Italian store Ingredients in Hartford, CT at D&D Market and the calamari came from my favorite fish market in Wethersfield, CT at City Fish, Wethersfield, CT.
