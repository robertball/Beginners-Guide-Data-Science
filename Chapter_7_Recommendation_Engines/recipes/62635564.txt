Ingredients:
2  cups unbleached flour
1/2  teaspoon salt
3  tablespoons corn or vegetable oil
1/2 -3/4 cup warm water
1  teaspoon sugar  (optional)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together and knead lightly. Let sit for 5-10 minutes.
Divide into medium sized pieces, a little bigger than eggs.
Flatten and fry on high heat for a few seconds per side.
They should puff up a bit and brown slightly.
Keep warm under a tea towel while making the rest.
Can be frozen for later use. Fry for a few seconds or reheat in microwave to soften and eat.

Description: 
After much fooling around, I got my recipe the way I want it. These are so much better than store brought! Very fresh tasting, quick and easy to make. Delicious with butter and a drizzle of honey for a sweet snack. (Oct.2007)
