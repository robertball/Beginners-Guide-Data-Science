Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1/3 cup coconut flour
1/3 cup powdered stevia baking blend
1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
2 teaspoons instant espresso powder (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 stick salted butter, at room temperature
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
Frosting:
8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1 stick salted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup powdered stevia baking blend
1/4 cup cocoa
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder
6 drops liquid stevia
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with cooking spray and dust with cocoa.
Whisk almond flour, coconut flour, stevia blend,  flaxseed meal, espresso powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat together eggs and butter using a large stand mixer or electric hand mixer and mixing bowl until thoroughly combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually add the almond flour mixture. Continue mixing and add 1/4 cup almond milk at a time until mixture is thick and frosting-like in consistency. Carefully spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven.
Meanwhile for the frosting, combine cream cheese, butter, stevia blend, cocoa, vanilla extract, espresso powder, liquid stevia, and salt in a large bowl using an electric mixer.
Remove cake from the oven when a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Frost cake.
