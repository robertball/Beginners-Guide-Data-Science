Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
2 pounds cubed lamb stew meat
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 cups beef stock
salt to taste
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook the lamb meat in batches until browned on all sides, using additional oil as necessary, about 3 minutes per batch. Set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in the onions; cook until tender and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir until the spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.
Return the lamb to the Dutch oven; pour in the beef stock and season with salt to taste. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the lamb is very tender, about 1 hour.
Once the lamb is very tender, remove the lid, and cook until the sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes. Stir in the yogurt and lemon juice before serving.
