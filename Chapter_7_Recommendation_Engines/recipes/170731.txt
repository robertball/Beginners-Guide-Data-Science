Ingredients:
1/3 cup tahini
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste
6 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets

Directions:
Whisk together the tahini, garlic, parsley, water, and lemon juice together in a bowl until no lumps of tahini remain. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry half of the cauliflower florets in the hot oil until they turn golden brown, about 8 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining florets. Serve immediately with the tahini sauce.
