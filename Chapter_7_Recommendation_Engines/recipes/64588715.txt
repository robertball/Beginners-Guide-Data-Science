Description: 
This is a rich, flavorful sauce for putting over Fettuccini noodles.  Everything goes in the slow cooker, cooks all day and makes the house smell delicious.  My son likes a ton of sauce over his noodles, so this fills the bill.  My husband, who doesn't say much about anything that I cook, said this is a keeper!
