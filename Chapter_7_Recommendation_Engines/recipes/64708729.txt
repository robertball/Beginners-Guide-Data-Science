Ingredients:
18 oz. cake mix: Devil’s Food, Dark Chocolate, German Chocolate, or Butter
3-1/2 oz. package instant chocolate fudge pudding mix
1/2 c. Butter, softened
4 eggs
4 tsp. Vanilla
1 c. Sour cream
1/2 c. Vegetable oil
3/4 c. Kahlua
2 T. Water
1 tsp. Cinnamon
1 to 1-1/2 c. Chocolate chips
Glaze:
1/2 c. Butter
1 c. Sugar
1/4 c. Kahlua
1/4 c. Water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and move rack to the second lowest position. Generously grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan (or I think the cooking  spray with flour in it for baking is the best option).
In large bowl combine all ingredients except the chocolate chips and beat until well blended.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Pour into prepared Bundt pan.
Bake for 45-60 minutes or until the cake tests done.
While cake is baking prepare the glaze by combining all the ingredients in a medium saucepan.
Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 2 minutes, stirring often.
Before removing cake from the pan, poke holes in the cake.
Spoon the glaze over the cake and let it soak into the cake in the pan for 4 hours.
If making 12 mini-Bundt cakes, bake for 20 minutes.
Can switch out yogurt or low fat sour cream for the sour cream: Bailey’s Irish Cream or Tia Maria for the Kahlua; and any kind of chips for the chocolate chips.
If you want a more traditional icing, omit the glaze, turn the cake out onto a plate; mix 1 c. Powdered sugar and 2-4 T. Of Kahlua together, and pour over the cake.
