Ingredients:
1 carrot, grated
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 pounds ground beef
1/2 cup ketchup
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1 cup tomato sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, saute the carrot and onion for 2 minutes, or until onion is transparent. Add garlic and saute for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
In a large bowl, combine the parsley, beef, ketchup, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, bread and eggs, mixing well. Add the carrot/onion mixture and continue mixing, but do not over mix, as this will make the meatloaf dry. Transfer mixture to a 9x13 baking dish and form into a loaf.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes.
While loaf is baking, heat the remaining tomato sauce and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Pour over loaf when done.

Description: 
Great for any occasion, and absolutely delicious. Excellent served with noodles (or mashed potatoes) and corn. Substitute white bread for wheat bread if you're looking for a healthier meal. For the fresh bread crumbs, use 6 to 8 slices bread crumbled into tiny pieces.
