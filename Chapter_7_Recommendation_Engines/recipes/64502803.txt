Ingredients:
1 15-oz can white beans, drained and rinsed
1 c mashed potatoes (p. 18)
1 carrot
1 parsnip (optional)
2 celery stalks
1 small onion
2½ tbsp poultry seasoning (to taste)
½ tsp rubbed sage
2–3 tbsp nutritional yeast
2–3 tbsp yellow miso*
¾ c instant oats (uncooked)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F
Pulse beans in a food processor or mash in a bowl with a fork so no whole beans are left, but mixture is still chunky with some bean parts. Transfer to a mixing bowl along with the mashed potatoes and set aside.
Grate, chop, or pulse vegetables in a food processor until finely minced, but do not puree. Add to mixing bowl with seasonings, nutritional yeast, and miso, stirring to combine.
Stir in oats and taste, adding additional nutritional yeast or miso if desired.
Transfer combined mixture to your loaf pan, pat down firmly, and bake for 30–40 minutes until firmer and crisp on the top (make sure it’s not still wet).
Let cool in the pan for 10–20 minutes before serving out of it (while keeping it perfectly intact).
