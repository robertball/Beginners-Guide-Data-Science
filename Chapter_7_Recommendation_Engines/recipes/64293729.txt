Ingredients:
3 - 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 tbsp vegetable oil or olive oil
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
4 tsp cornstarch
1/3 cup water
1 cup cooked white rice
1/2 tbsp (or more) sesame seeds
3 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in Crock-Pot so that they are not overlapping and lightly season both sides with salt and pepper.
In a medium bowl, combine onion, garlic, honey, ketchup, soy sauce, oil and red pepper flakes. Pour over chicken. Cook on low for 3-4 hours, or high for 2 hours.
Remove chicken to a cutting board, leaving sauce in Crock-Pot. Shred chicken into bite-sized pieces; set aside. Prepare rice according to package instructions.
In a small bowl, dissolve 4 tsp cornstarch in 1/3 cup water; add to crock pot. Stir to combine with sauce. Cover and cook sauce on high for ten more minutes, or until slightly thickened.
Add cooked rice to 4 plates, top with chicken and spoon sauce over top. Sprinkle evenly with sesame seeds and chopped onions.

My girlfriend and I made this recently. It was very easy to make, very flavourful and was enough to feed both of us with plenty of leftovers.
