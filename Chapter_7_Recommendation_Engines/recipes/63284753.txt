Ingredients:
1 medium red potato, diced
10-15 asparagus stalks
water
1/2 tsp salt
2T butter
1 cup broth (veg or chicken)
2 cups milk
1T chives, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
chives for garnish

Directions:
Cover asparagus and potatoes with water.
Bring to a boil, then simmer, covered for about 10 minutes or until potatoes break easily with a fork.
Drain and reserve cooking water
Put vegetables back in pot
Add butter and melt
Add broth, milk, and chives
Puree mixture with an immersion blender or in batches in a regular blender
Heat until almost boiling, but not quite
Add salt and pepper to taste (about 1/2 tsp more salt, then test - the potato will absorb a lot of salt)
If the soup is too thick, add the reserved vegetable cooking water until it reaches the desired consistency.  If it's too thin, you can add more potato next time.
Garnish with chives
