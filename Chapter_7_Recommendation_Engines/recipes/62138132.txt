Description: 
A variation on the classic crispy rice and marshmallow treats with peanut butter and not as much O-shaped oat cereal as the popular oat variation of that version of the recipe.  All toasted oats can be a little overwhelming.  This also has a higher ratio of cereal to other ingredients so it is somewhat more healthful.
