Ingredients:
3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 tsp dried oregano
2 lbs. thin cut chicken breasts (can also use regular chicken breasts or chicken thighs)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a large ziploc bag.  Ensure that each piece of chicken is coated in marinade.  Place in refrigerator and marinate for 30-60 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Farenheit.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Arrange marinated chicken on baking sheet and discard excess marinade.  Bake chicken for 13-15 minutes, or until juices run clear (if not using thin-cut chicken breasts, adjust time and temperature accordingly).

Description: 
Healthy and very tasty.  It is great to eat hot or cold - make extra chicken so you have leftovers! I like to serve with arugula salad and/or quinoa.
