1 C. light corn syrup
1/2 t. salt

1 t. vanilla extract

Directions:
In a deep, HEAVY saucepot, combine the sugar, 1 C of cream, the corn syrup, and salt.
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes.
Add remaining cream slowly, so that mixture does not stop boiling.
Cook an additional 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Stir in butter.
Cook slowly, stirring constantly, until mixture reaches 248 degrees F. on a candy thermometer. (Firm Ball stage)
Remove from heat.
Stir in vanilla and nuts, if desired.
Pour into a well buttered 8" square pan.
Chill until cold.
Turn candy out onto a cutting surface.
Cut into small squares.
Wrap each piece in pre-cut wax paper squares.
Wrap again, in different colored foils, for gift giving.
Store wrapped candies in a covered container in a cool, dry place.
Time does not include chilling time, cutting, or hand wrapping.
Enjoy!
