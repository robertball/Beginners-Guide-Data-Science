Ingredients:
1 link Johnsonville® Three-Cheese Italian Style Sausage (from 13.5 oz. pkg.), thinly sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice
1 (8 ounce) package baby bella or white mushrooms, thinly slices
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup white wine (pinot grigio or chardonnay)
1 (15 ounce) jar Classico® Alfredo Sauce (or Classico® Alfredo Lite)
1 cup freshly grated fontina cheese
1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 (9 ounce) packages cheese tortellini (or other variety)
1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley

Directions:
Boil water in a large pot to boil the tortellini according to package directions.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add onion. Saute the onion for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until softened. Add sliced mushrooms, crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper and continue cooking for 5 minutes, add the sausage and saute mixing all together allowing the ingredients to caramelize and brown on the edges, about 5 more minutes.
Add wine, bring to a low simmer for about 2 minutes, stirring and gently scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour in the Alfredo sauce, stir together.
As it starts to bubble add the cheeses, stir to blend until melted. Add the hot cooked tortellini and fold over gently to coat the pasta.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.
