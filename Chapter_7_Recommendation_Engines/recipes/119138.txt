Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
4 teaspoons shortening
3/4 cup ground walnuts

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar. Add vanilla. Gradually add flour; mix well.
With lightly floured hands, shape tablespoonfuls into 2-in. logs. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until edges and bottom are lightly browned. Cool for 2-3 minutes before removing to wire racks.
In a microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate chips and shortening; stir until smooth. Drizzle chocolate over half of the cookies. Dip one end of remaining cookies into chocolate, then sprinkle with walnuts.

Description: 
I first made these rich and tender cookies as a teenager and now make them for my husband and our two sons. The smiles on their faces are well worth the time and effort.                           --Michele Fenner, Girard, Pennsylvania
