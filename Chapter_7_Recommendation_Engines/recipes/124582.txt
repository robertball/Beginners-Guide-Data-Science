Description: 
This skillet dish is so easy to make on those busy days, and it's delicious, too! I got the recipe at a covered-dish luncheon at my church. I liked it so much, I asked for the recipe, and I like to share it with others.     Folks are surprised that it's so easy to make - but don't tell anyone!
