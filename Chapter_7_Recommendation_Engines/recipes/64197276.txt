Ingredients:
2 cups elbow macaroni or pasta of your choice
1 2/3 cup milk
2 Tbsp butter
2 Tbsp flour
4 oz Gruyere cheese, grated
4 oz extra-sharp Cheddar Cheese
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 cup crushed potato chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cook pasta according to package directions.  While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large saucepan.  Add the flour and whisk over low heat constantly until roux is smooth, about 2 minutes.  While still whisking, add the milk.  Continue to whisk or stir until the sauce is smooth and thickened, about 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and add grated cheeses, salt, pepper and onion powder.  Add cooked, drained pasta.  Stir well and allow to sit for a couple of minutes to allow cheese to begin melting.  Spoon into a casserole and top with crushed potato chips.  Bake for 35-40 minutes until sauce is bubbly and chips are browned slightly.

Description: 
My husband is not a big fan the generic orange mac and cheese, made from a box.  It took me a lot of experimenting to find a good balance of adult flavors to tempt his palate.  Now this is our go-to recipe for a filling winter meal.  Just add crusty french bread and a garden salad for a complete and tasty meal.
