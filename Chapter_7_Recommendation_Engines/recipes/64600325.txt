Ingredients:
2/3 cup plain Greek-style yogurt
1 garlic clove, halved
Kosher salt
2 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
10 cups fresh spinach (10 ounces)
1 tsp fresh lemon juice
4 large eggs
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
pinch of paprika
1 tsp chopped fresh oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300°. Melt 1 Tbsp butter with oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add onion; reduce heat to low. Cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and lemon juice; season with salt. Increase heat to medium-high; cook, turning frequently, until wilted, 4–5 minutes.
Remove any liquid from skillet and  make 4 deep indentations in center of spinach. Carefully break 1 egg into each hollow, taking care to keep yolks intact. Bake until egg whites are set, 10–15 minutes.
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add red pepper, paprika and a pinch of salt and cook until butter starts to foam and browned bits form at bottom of pan, 1–2 minutes. Add oregano and cook for 30 seconds longer. Remove garlic halves from yogurt; discard. Spoon yogurt over spinach and eggs. Drizzle with spiced butter.

Description: 
By flavoring spinach with melted leeks and scallions, baking eggs on top, and finishing with a dollop of yogurt and a drizzle of butter spiced with a smoky Turkish chili powder known as kirmizi biber (though crushed red pepper flakes will also work). Serve the dish in one large skillet or two small ones. It's always nice to surprise people, he says
