Description: 
These little frittatas are so quick and easy, and my husband and kids just gobble them up. Make them in a 24 cup mini-muffin tin. 

I first had these at a neighborhood breakfast, and my neighbor added fresh onions and veggies, but this is great for making on nights when there isn't much in the fridge! Honey ham is good in these, as well. They can be served hot or cold and are great as reheated leftovers.
