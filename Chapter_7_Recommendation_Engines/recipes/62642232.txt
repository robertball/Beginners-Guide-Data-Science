Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil and three kernels of corn in a large pot over medium heat.
When the three kernels pop, stir in the sugar and popcorn.
Cover, and shake the pot constantly to keep the sugar from burning.
Once the popping has slowed to once every 2 to 3 seconds, remove the pot from the heat and continue to shake for a few minutes until the popping has stopped.
Pour into a large bowl, and allow to cool, stirring  to break up large clumps.

Description: 
White sugar makes the Kettle Corn taste like popcorn balls. Use brown sugar and it will taste like caramel corn.  If you are under 12, let Mom or Dad help.Modified from: Kettle Corn
