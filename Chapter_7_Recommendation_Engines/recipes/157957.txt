Ingredients:
5 quarts chicken broth
10 cups uncooked white rice
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1 1/2 cups chopped onion, divided
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried oregano

Directions:
Place the chicken broth, rice, celery, and 1 cup of chopped onion into a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1/2 cup of onion into a large skillet along with the garlic, pork sausage, and ground beef. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the meat is brown and crumbly; pour off excess grease, then stir the meat into the cooked rice along with the thyme, parsley, and oregano. Stir well.

Description: 
This is a rice and sausage stuffing that is always a hit. No one ever tires of eating this as leftovers - it doesn't even need any turkey to go with it to make a nice snack or meal. But stuff a turkey with it, and you have an excellent alternative to traditional bread stuffings. The recipe shown here is the huge Thanksgiving-day-with-tons-of-leftovers version. You can obviously cut it down proportionately for smaller meals. The original recipe, as I received it, called for addition of a couple of cans of shucked oysters, something not to my taste, but you can add this if you wish.
