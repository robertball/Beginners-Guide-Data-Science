Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Sift together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and baking soda; set aside.
In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine, brown sugar and honey until light and fluffy. Stir in the sifted ingredients alternating with the milk and vanilla. Cover dough and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide the chilled dough iinto quarters. On a well floured surface, roll the dough out  one quarter at a time iinto a 5x15 inch rectangle. Divide into rectangles using a knife. Place rectangles ointo ungreased cookie sheets. Mark a line down the center of each one, and prick with a fork. For a cinnamon flavored cracker, sprinkle with a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
