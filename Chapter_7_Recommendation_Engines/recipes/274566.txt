Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 pinch salt
1 cup water, divided
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3 drops red food coloring, or as desired (optional)
3 cups fresh strawberries, sliced
1 (9 inch) baked pie crust
8 ounces heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Stir sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Add 3 tablespoons water and mix into a paste.
Bring remaining water to a boil in a pot. Add to sugar mixture slowly. Let mixture simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick and clear, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add lemon juice, almond extract, and red food coloring.
Let mixture cool for at least 15 minutes; fold in strawberries. Pour into the prepared pie crust. Chill until set, at least 1 hour.
Whip heavy cream in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer; add confectioners' sugar slowly until combined. Spread topping over chilled pie.
