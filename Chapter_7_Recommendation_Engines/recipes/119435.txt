Description: 
'We try to eat healthy, but that can be difficult with our busy schedules,' writes Margaret Kruse from Virginia Beach, Virginia. 'To save time, I freeze chopped onions and peppers to use in entrees like this one. And to cut back on calories and fat. I saute foods in fat-free Italian salad dressing.'
