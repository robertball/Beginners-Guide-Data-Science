Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 lb. ground beef
1 egg slightly beaten
1/4 cup ketchup
1 clove garlic, minced or 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
1/2-3/4 cup quick oats
1 small sweet yellow onion, finely diced
1 tsp. chili powder (optional)
Sauce:
1/2 bottle BBQ sauce (we like Cookies or Sweet Baby Ray's) (approx. 1.5 cups)
1/2 bottle ketchup (approx. 1.5 cups)

Directions:
Mix all meatball ingredients thoroughly. Shape into golf ball sized balls or slightly larger. Place meatballs in a greased 7x11 glass baking dish (or any oven-safe dish of similar size).
Bake at 325 for 45 minutes. I then remove from oven and drain any visible fat juices. Top with equal parts BBQ sauce and ketchup until meatballs are mostly covered.
Bake for an additional 30 minutes at 325 degrees uncovered. May test for doneness with meat thermometer.
Faster baking method: Top with sauce immediately and bake at 350 degrees for about 40-45 minutes. May test for doneness with meat thermometer.
