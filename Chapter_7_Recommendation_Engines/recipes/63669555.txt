Ingredients:
5 medium apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
5 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups sugar
4 large eggs
1 cup vegetable or canola oil
1/2 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Grease and flour a 10" tube pan.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together the 5 tablespoons of sugar with the cinnamon in a large bowl.  Add apple slices and toss to coat.
In another bowl, mix ALL cake ingredients together and beat until smooth and thoroughly blended.  Mixture will be thick.
Place half of the batter in the tube pan.  Top with half of the apple slices.  Place remaining half of the batter into pan, and neatly arrange remaining apple slices on top.
Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean.
Cool in the pan for 1 hour, then transfer to a rack to completely cool.

Description: 
I've been making this cake for over 30 years, and always get great compliments from it.  Even my sweets-hating husband likes this one.  I've been making it for my mother's birthday for years...it's her favorite.  It's a dense cake with great flavor, so if you're looking for a light, fluffy cake, this is not for you!!
