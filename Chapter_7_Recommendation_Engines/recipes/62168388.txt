Ingredients:
1 Bag Pretzels (Snyder's of Hanover Butter Snap Pretzels)
1 (13 ounce) package chocolate covered caramel candies (e.g. Rolo TM)
Pecan Pieces

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Arrange desired number of cris-cross shaped square pretzels on cookie sheet. Place chocolate covered carmel (without wrapper) on top of pretzels. Then top each with a piece of pecan.
Bake for 1-3 minutes, just enough to barely melt the chocolate. Remove from oven to cool. Gently press pecan into chocolate just enough so when it cools the treat will stay together but not be smooshed.
