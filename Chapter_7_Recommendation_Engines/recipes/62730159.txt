Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups (185 grams) toasted hazelnuts
?1 cup (250 ml) whole milk
?2 cups (500 ml) heavy cream
?3/4 cup (170g) sugar
?1/4 tsp coarse salt
?4 oz milk chocolate (at least 30% cacao solids), chopped
?5 large egg yolks?
1/8 tsp vanilla extract
For the Stracciatella: 5 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped (not chocolate chips)

Directions:
Toast the hazelnuts in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes, until fragrant and lightly toasted. Place them in a kitchen towel after roasting to remove as much of the papery skin as possible. Discard the skins. Chop the hazelnuts in a food processor or blender until finely chopped. Warm the milk with 1 cup of the cream, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Once warm, remove from heat and add the chopped toasted hazelnuts. Cover and let steep for 1-1/2 hours. Put the milk chocolate pieces in a large bowl. Heat the remaining 1 cup of cream in a medium saucepan until it begins to boil. Pour the cream over the milk chocolate pieces and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Set a mesh strainer over the top of the bowl. Pour the hazelnut-infused milk through a strainer into a medium saucepan. Squeeze the nuts with your hands to extract as much of the flavorful liquid as possible. Discard the hazelnuts. Rewarm the hazelnut-infused mixture. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm hazelnut mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.
