Ingredients:
2 cups whole spelt flour
1 cup carob powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups honey
1 cup strong brewed vanilla hazelnut tea (such as YogiÂ®)
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the spelt flour, carob powder, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl.
Stir the honey, brewed tea, cream, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Add the honey mixture into the flour mixture, and stir to thoroughly combine; pour into an 8x11-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out gummy rather than wet, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool before refrigerating overnight for best results.
