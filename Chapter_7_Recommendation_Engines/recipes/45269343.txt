Ingredients:
1 lbs. dried lentils, rinsed
3 quarts chicken broth
1 cup chopped onion
2 garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 green or red bell peppers, veined and chopped
4 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, sliced
2 cups tomato puree
Salt and pepper to taste
6 slices bacon, meaty preferred
2 ounces pimiento, chopped

Directions:
Wash the lentils in a sieve, checking for twigs and stones.  Place in a soup pot, add the chicken broth, and simmer over medium heat.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and saute the onion until softened.  Add the garlic, bell peppers, carrots, and celery.  Saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
After the lentils have simmered for 30 minutes, add the vegetable mixture and the tomato puree.  Continue to cook the soup over low heat.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a separate skillet over medium heat to render some of the fat.  When the bacon is almost crisp, drain it and add it to the soup.  Simmer the soup for thirty minutes longer.  Add the pimientos and additional salt and pepper if needed toward the end of the cooking time.  If the soup thickens too much, thin with more chicken broth
