4 ounces feta cheese, cubed, or more to taste

salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch freshly ground nutmeg (optional)

Cut off the thick stems of chard and disregard. Roughly chop chard leaves and wash. Place wet chard into a pot, cover, and cook over medium heat until chard has wilted, about 5 minutes.
