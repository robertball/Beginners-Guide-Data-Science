Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans asparagus
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives
1/2 pound fettuccini pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 large portobello mushrooms, sliced
1 (8 ounce) can peas, drained
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with water and the drained liquids of the asparagus and the olives; bring to a boil.  Cook pasta for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute mushrooms, peas, and Italian seasoning until mushrooms are tender.
In a blender or food processor, puree asparagus, black olives, tomato paste and Parmesan.  Transfer to a small saucepan, and heat through over medium-low heat.  Spoon asparagus sauce over fettuccini, and top with mushrooms and peas.
