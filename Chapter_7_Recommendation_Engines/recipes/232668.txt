Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 cup white popcorn kernels
1/2 teaspoon popcorn salt, divided
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground chipotle chile pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground ancho chile pepper

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; add 1 popcorn kernel to the hot oil. The oil is ready when the kernel pops.
Pour popcorn kernels into the hot oil; season with half the popcorn salt. Stir to coat. Cover the pot with a sheet of aluminum foil. Poke about 10 holes into the aluminum foil using a knife. Cook popcorn until all the kernels are popped, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat; sprinkle popcorn with remaining popcorn salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, chipotle chile pepper, and ancho chile pepper. Toss to evenly coat.

Description: 
Popcorn as good as the theater's, with a kick! Salty, spicy and a little smoky. All you need is a large pot or metal bowl. I use a large 2 gallon metal bowl. Omit the chili powders if you don't like it spicy.
