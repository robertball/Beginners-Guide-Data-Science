Ingredients:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting
2 cups white sugar
1 cup water
2/3 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon peppermint oil, or other flavored oil
1 teaspoon any color food coloring

Directions:
Generously coat a cookie sheet with confectioners' sugar, and set aside.
In a heavy bottomed saucepan, stir together the white sugar, water and corn syrup until sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium-high and cook to a temperature of 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads. Remove from heat, and stir in the flavored oil and food coloring.
Immediately pour the sugar mixture onto the prepared cookie sheet in a thin stream (this helps it cool). When the candy is cool enough for the outer edge to hold its shape, cut into bite size pieces with scissors. Let cool completely, then store in an airtight container.
