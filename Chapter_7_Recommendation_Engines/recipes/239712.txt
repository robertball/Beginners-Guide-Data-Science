Ingredients:
1 cup blueberries
1 cup warm water
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Mix blueberries, water, and sugar together using a whisk in a small saucepan over low heat until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and bring a gentle boil, stirring often, until syrup is thickened, about 15 minutes.
Whisk lemon juice into syrup; serve immediately or cool.

Description: 
This flavored simple syrup is very versatile and goes with so many things. I especially like to put it on top of French toast, in pancake or waffle batter, and it's very yummy in cornbread or biscuit batter. This can be made in advanced and stored and refrigerated in a glass jar.
