Ingredients:
1 medium butternut squash, diced
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 pound kale, chopped
1/4 cup vegetable broth
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place squash in a bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and garlic powder. Spread onto a rimmed baking pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat remaining oil in a large frying pan or work over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in the hot oil for 1 minute. Add kale and vegetable broth, cover, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Uncover and continue to saute kale until wilted and tender, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat and mix in gnocchi, squash, and Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a delightful late summer or fall dish. Veggies and gnocchi - how can you go wrong? It was loved by my wife and myself. It's especially good if you make your own gnocchi - we did and followed the recipe for ricotta gnocchi on this website.
