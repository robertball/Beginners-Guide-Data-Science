Ingredients:
2  limes, juiced
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
Â½ teaspoon ground cumin
8  chicken thighs

Directions:
Stir lime juice, honey, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, and cumin together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag,  add chicken, coat chicken with the marinade, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken thighs from the marinade and shake to remove excess moisture. Discard remaining marinade.
Cook the chicken thighs until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
