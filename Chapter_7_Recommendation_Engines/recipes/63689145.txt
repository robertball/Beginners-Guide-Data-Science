Ingredients:
1 bunch of Kale
1/2 red onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 carrots, julienned
Olive oil, to coat
Salt and pepper, to taste
Jalape√±o, diced, to taste

Directions:
Rip the kale into 2-4 inch pieces (like lettuce in a salad).  Add the remaining ingredients and toss.
Using aluminum foil make a cookie sheet and place on preheated grill (350F). Spray with olive oil.
Place the kale salad on the foil and toss with salad tongs. Don't worry about having a large amount of kale, it will cook down.  Grill for 6-8 mins, or to preferred texture.
