Prepared Masa
Large shrimp split 2-3 per tamale
1 tbsp chunky salsa
cilantro
1 slice of monterey jack per tamale

Directions:
Make your masa like you usually do. My filling is, I cut large or really large shrimp split sideways down the middle, I use at least 2 to 3 per tamale,put 1 tbsp chunky salsa, chopped cilentro, i slice monterey jack cheese 1 inch by 3 inch and a couple of green olives, in each one and roll them up as usual, wrapped in the corn husk and steam. After cooked I cover them with green enchilada sauce and melted cheese. The shrimp will melt in your mouth with goodness!!!
