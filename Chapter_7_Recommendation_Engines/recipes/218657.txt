Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup sifted all purpose flour
2 tablespoons sifted all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat  oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
With an electric mixer, cream together the sugar, vegetable shortening, egg, and vanilla extract in a bowl until light and fluffy. Sift 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of flour together with the baking powder and salt in a bowl, and stir the flour mixture into the creamed mixture; mix in the coconut until thoroughly combined. Drop the dough by teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned, about 10 minutes; allow cookies to cool on sheets for about 1 minute before removing to finish cooling on baking racks.
