Description: 
I created this recipe with the goal of making a more healthy apple bread. To make it more healthy, I did not want to add any extra sugar and I wanted to pack it with omega-3 fats and protein.  Do not worry, it is very lightly sweetened because most apple butter is made with added sugar.
