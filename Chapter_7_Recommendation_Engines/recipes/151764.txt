Ingredients:
3 cups PLANTERS Pecan Pieces, divided
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 (14 ounce) package KRAFT Caramels
2/3 cup whipping cream, divided
1 (8 ounce) package BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place 2 cups of the pecan pieces in food processor or blender container; cover. Process until finely ground, using pulsing action. Mix with granulated sugar and butter. Press firmly onto bottom and up side of 9-inch pie plate. Bake 12 to 15 min. or until lightly browned. Cool completely. (If crust puffs up during baking, gently press down with back of spoon.)
Microwave caramels and 1/3 cup of the whipping cream in microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2-1/2 to 3 min. or until caramels are completely melted, stirring after each min. Pour into crust. Chop remaining 1 cup pecans; sprinkle over caramel layer.
Place chocolate, remaining 1/3 cup whipping cream, the powdered sugar and vanilla in saucepan; cook on low heat just until chocolate is completely melted, stirring constantly. Pour over pie; gently spread to evenly cover top of pie. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Store leftover pie in refrigerator.
