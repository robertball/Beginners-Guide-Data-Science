Ingredients:
Fruit Filling-
5 to 7 Gala Apples (depending on size of apple, better to have too many)
1 Package of fresh Blackberries
3 TBSP Flour
1/2 Cup White Sugar
1 Lemon
Crisp Topping-
3-5 TBSP Flour
1 1/2 Cup Quick Oats
1 Stick Melted Butter
2 TBSP Brown Sugar
2 TBSP White Sugar
1/4 TSP Cinnamon
1/4 TSP Cloves
1/4 TSP Nutmeg

Directions:
Peel, core and cut apples in to 1 inch cubes
In a large mixing coat apples with flour
Add sugar, squeeze of 1 lemon and blackberries
Place apple mixture in a 9x13 glass baking dish
In a medium bowl mix dry ingredients for Crisp Topping
Add melted butter and mix until crumbly
(I like alot of oats in my crisp, however you may decrease oats and add more flour to your mixture)
Press Crisp Topping on to Fruit Filling
Bake 35-45 Minutes, WATCH the last ten minutes you only want to bake until you see juices bubbling up from the bottom of the pan. Over baking will result in mushy apples!
