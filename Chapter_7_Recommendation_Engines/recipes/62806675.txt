Ingredients:
1/2 lb ground beef
1/2 lb ground pork (I usually use 1 lb of ground beef but feel free to
experiment with the choice of meat you choose)
1 C cabbage, shredded and cooked. (I chop my cabbage up first until I
have 1 C or just over 1 C depending on how much you want) Cook until
just tender.
1 can bean sprouts, drained, rinsed and chopped finely
2 small packages of won-ton skins (12oz size.) You may also use egg
roll skins instead for a bigger egg roll.
1/3 C Celery, finely chopped
1 green onion finely chopped. I do not use the white part, just the greens.
1 tsp sesame oil
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp salt
1 T soy sauce
1/2 T cornstarch
1 beaten egg-for sealing egg rolls (set aside in a separate dish)

Directions:
Brown meat. Drain excess fat well.
Put meat in mixing bowl and chop up with a wooden spoon or anything that will make the meat very fine.
Place all ingredients EXCEPT the egg in the mixing bowl and mix well.
Once mixed, place a small amount in middle of square wonton skin or a
bigger amount if you are going to use the egg roll skins.
For wonton skins, wipe egg on two edges of skin and fold over to shape a triangle and press skins together.
For egg roll skins roll according to directions on package.
Fry in hot oil at about 360 or so. Fry just until they start to turn brown
