Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup canola or safflower oil
1 Tbsp vanilla
2 cups grated zucchini
1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 Tbsp cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 loaf pans.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, oil, vanilla, and zucchini until well blended.
In a separate large bowl, sift all of the dry ingredients and combine with a whisk.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones, a little at a time, stirring just until combined.
Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans and bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Description: 
Although zucchini in a sweet bread may sound unusual, this moist, cinnamon-scented bread is truly comforting and delicious.
