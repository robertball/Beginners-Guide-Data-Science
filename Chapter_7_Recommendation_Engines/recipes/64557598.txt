set them aside to cool
saute a couple cloves of garlic in some light light olive oil.
put the cauliflower, garlic, some salt, some pepper, parmesian cheese, and the cream cheese into the food processor
process on high until creamy (now it's garlic mashed potatoes, i mean cauliflower )
set aside
slice a zucchini length wise with a vegetable peeler (no need to peel first - just toss the first and last pieces that are all peel)
layout onto towels and pat dry (or stack them and let them sit a few minutes)
oil a 4x9 (ish) glass baking dish
layer zuccini slices to cover the bottom
layer the mashed cauliflower on top of that
add a layer of caramelized sweet onions on top of that
add a layer of cheese on top of that.
repeat layering until pan is full or ingredients run out ending with a layer of zuccini and then a bit more cheese on top of that
bake at 350 for 30 mintues.
then broil for about 2 minutes (watch it) until the cheese is perfectly browned on top.
