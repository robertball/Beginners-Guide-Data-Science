Ingredients:
3 cups flour
2 tsp. baking soda
6 tbsp. cocoa
2 cups sugar
1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. vanilla
2 tbsp. white vinegar
1/2 cup and 2 tbsp. vegetable oil
2 cups tepid water

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift dry ingredients together and stir with a whisk. Using the bottom of your one-cup measuring cup, make three large indentations/wells in the dry ingredients.
In the first well, measure in the vanilla, vinegar goes in the second well and oil in the third
Over everything, pour the water. Stir with a whisk until well blended. The batter will be runny and should contain no lumps
Pour batter into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Top with your favorite icing. Jamey thinks plain vanilla icing is best.
