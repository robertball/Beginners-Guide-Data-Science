Ingredients:
1 cup Pearl (Israeli) couscous
2 cups vegetable stock
1 tbs extra virgin olive oil
4 ripe Heirloom tomatoes, quartered
15 cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 English cucumber, cubed
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup packed fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley
1 clove of garlic, crushed
1 tbs each of fresh oregano & thyme (or 1/2 tbs dried)
1/2 cup pitted green olives
1 cup Feta cheese, crumbled
4 tbs white Balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup Extra virgin olive oil
juice of one lemon

Directions:
Heat the vegetable stock in a sauce pan.
Sautee the couscous in 1 tbs olive oil until golden.
Transfer the couscous to the hot vegetable stock and bring to a boil, then simmer until the stock is absorbed, ~15 mins. Fluff and allow to cool.
Place basil, parsley, oregano, thyme, olives, and garlic in a food processor, and pulse until the herbs are coarsely chopped.
Combine the tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and Feta with the herb mixture and couscous.
Add the Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and lemon, and toss until well mixed.
Cool and serve.
