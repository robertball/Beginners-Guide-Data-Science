Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
¼ cup water or milk
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp butter or margarine

Directions:
Combine the brown sugar and water in a tall saucepan. (A shallow pan will make it too difficult to beat without splashing).
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring all the while. Continue stirring and boiling until a drop of the mixture forms a ball when dropped in a glass of lukewarm water.
Remove from heat. Add vanilla and beat in with a fork.
Then add butter and continue beating until the mixture is light in colour and starts to solidify on the sides of the pot (at least a minute).
Pour immediately onto a greased plate or aluminum pie pan. Cut into squares when almost cooled.

Description: 
Make this when you just have to have a sweet fix. Uses stuff that you are sure to have in the cupboard. Doesn’t make too big of a batch, so there’s just enough to satisfy a few people, or to make one person feel over-indulged.
It's not the typical soft fudge that most people think of, but I believe it's called Old Fashioned Fudge and looks like Cornish Butter Tablet.
