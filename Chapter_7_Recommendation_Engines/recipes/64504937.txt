Ingredients:
1 crust for single crust pie (I use Julia Child's recipe ALWAYS)
1 or 2 plum tomatoes, cut into thin slices
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
olive oil
dash salt
1 c. freshly shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 c. finely shredded parmesan cheese
1/4 c. feta cheese, chopped very fine
1/2 c. chopped fresh basil
6 eggs
1 cup heavy cream
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Make pie crust (or use ready made) and put in 9" pie pan. Set aside.
Place sliced tomatoes in a shallow dish, sprinkle minced garlic and salt, and drizzle olive oil over all.  Set aside for at least 20 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
Mix eggs, cream, salt and pepper using KitchenAid or hand held mixer or food processor, until smooth and completely mixed.
Mix cheeses together in a small bowl, then layer cheese, then basil, then tomatoes in pie shell.  Gently pour egg mixture over all. Bake at 375Â° for 35-45 minutes until eggs are set and no longer wiggly.
