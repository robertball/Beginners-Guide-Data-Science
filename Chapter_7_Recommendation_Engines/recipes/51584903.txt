Ingredients:
4 Portobello mushrooms, stemmed, gills removed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 5-ounce can albacore tuna packed in water, drained
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper
4 thin slices Swiss cheese
4 slices tomato
1/2 cup mixed baby greens

Directions:
Preheat the broiler. Brush the mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and broil, turning once until softened and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
While the mushrooms are cooking, in a bowl, combine tuna, celery, parsley, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and remaining tablespoon oil.
Remove the mushrooms from the oven. Divide tuna mixture among mushrooms, and spread evenly in caps. Top each with a slice of cheese, and broil until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Top each mushroom with a tomato slice and 2 tablespoons greens, and serve immediately.
