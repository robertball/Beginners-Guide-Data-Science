Ingredients:
2 c ap flour
2 t baking powder
1/2 t salt
1/2 c unsalted butter
1 c granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 t vanilla
1/2 c buttermilk
2 1/2 c fresh or frozen blueberries
Crumb Topping:
6 T unsalted butter
1/4 granulated sugar
1/4 c packed brown sugar
3/4 t ground cinnamon
Pinch of salt
3/4 c ap flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line 18 muffin tins with paper liners or spray with nonstick spray.  In a mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt and whisk well.  In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and granulated sugar for 4-5 minutes or until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until the egg is incorporated before adding the next one, and then beat in the vanilla.
Add the milk, alternating with dry ingredients, in 2-3 additions.  Do not overmix.  Fold in the berries using a spatula.  To make the crumb topping, combine the butter, sugars, cinnamon, salt and flour and mix with a fork or pastry blender until crumbly.
Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tins.  Top each with a generous tablespoon of the crumb topping.  Bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of one comes out clean.  Let the muffins cool slightly in the muffin tin set on wire racks before removing.
