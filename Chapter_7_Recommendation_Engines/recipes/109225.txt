Stir together Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, liquid smoke, lemon juice, teriyaki sauce, ketchup, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Mix in the sliced venison until completely coated. Cover tightly, and marinate at least 8 hours in the refrigerator.
