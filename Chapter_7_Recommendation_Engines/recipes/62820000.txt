Ingredients:
32 oz squeeze bottle ketchup
1/2 medium sweet onion, minced finely
3-4 cloves garlic, minced finely
2/3 cup Worcestershire Sauce
Juice of one lemon
2 TBS mollasses
2 TBS Malt Vinegar
1 TBS salt
1 TBS thyme
3 TSP mustard
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
4-5 dashes Tabasco

Directions:
Combine all ingredients, cover & simmer on low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
SPICY Variation:  Omit the brown sugar and honey, increase tabasco to 2 tsp.
Hint:  As I am simmering the concoction, I soak the labels off the squeeze bottle that the ketchup came in, and then I pour the sauce back into the bottle when cooled.  Makes for an easy way to dispense the sauce.

Description: 
A favorite in our home.  Don't even think about slathering this sauce on the meat BEFORE cooking (well... go ahead if that floats your boat.. but Don't tell anyone..)
