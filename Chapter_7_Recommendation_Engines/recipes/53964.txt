Ingredients:
1 teaspoon yeast extract spread, e.g. Marmite/Vegemite
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt

4 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup cold water
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in yeast extract spread, onion powder, and salt until smooth. Gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups water so no lumps form. Bring to a boil. In a small cup, stir together 1/2 cup cold water and cornstarch. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the saucepan, and continue boiling until thickened. Cool slightly before serving.
