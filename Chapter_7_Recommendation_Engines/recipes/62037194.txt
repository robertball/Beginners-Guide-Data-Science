Ingredients:
1 bunch of green onions, chopped
1 pkg. cream cheese (room temp.)
1 pkg. chipped beef
1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce (optional)
Finely chopped pecans

Directions:
Mix all of the ingredients by hand and form into a ball.  I usually wrap it in wax paper and roll it around on the table while in the wax paper.  Roll in the chopped nuts and refrigerate.  Serve with crackers.
