Ingredients:
5 stalks celery, diced
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
5 cups crumbled cornbread
1/2 cup chopped, cooked turkey giblets
8 ounces shucked oysters
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 eggs
2 cups chicken stock

Directions:
In a skillet, saute the celery with the onions until the onions are translucent.
In a large bowl combine the crumbled cornbread, cooked celery, cooked onions, giblets, oysters, parley, basil, salt, paprika, dried sage and nutmeg. Toss well.
Beat the 2 eggs. Add the eggs and chicken stock to the stuffing mixture. Stuff stuffing in bird's cavity. Remove stuffing promptly once bird is cooked. You can also bake the stuffing separately from the bird in a large casserole dish. Bake it in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes.
