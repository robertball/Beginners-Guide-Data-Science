1 3/4 cups dark Rye Flour
1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1/8 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 1/3 cups hot water
1 Tbls sugar
3 tsp dry yeast
1 Tbl softened butter
1/4 cup molasses
1 1/2 tsp caraway seed (optional)

Directions:
In large mixer add flours, cocoa powder, salt and caraway seed.
In small bowl combine water, sugar and yeast, let sit until foamy (approx 5 minutes)then stir in butter and molasses.
Add the yeast mixture into flour mixture all at once and stir briefly by hand to combine wet and dry, then with dough hook on medium/high speed until a ball forms.  Sprinkle some additional whole wheat flour if needed during kneading to help ball stay clean from bowl.  Knead on low for 10 minutes (I use a kitchenaid mixer on speed 2) Remove from mixer, the dough will be sticky.
Place dough in oiled bowl and cover with plastic.  Let rise for approx 45 minutes until double. Form into loaf and put in oiled bread pan (For a round loaf on a stone sprinkled with cornmeal).  Let rise approximately 30-45 minutes until double.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
