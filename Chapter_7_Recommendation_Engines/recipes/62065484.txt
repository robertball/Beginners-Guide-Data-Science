Ingredients:
1 French baguette
1 package beef for fondue, thawed
1 large onion
1 cup mushrooms
1 green pepper
1 cup cheese whiz
Butter or margarine

Directions:
Slice the onion, mushrooms and green pepper.  In a large skillet, melt about 2 tablespoons of butter and cook the vegetables over medium heat until they are very soft (about 10 minutes).
While the vegetables are cooking, cut the baguette in 3 pieces.  These will become the buns.  Slice each "bun" on it's lenght 3/4 of the way through, keeping the bun in one piece.  Open up the bun and butter the inside.  Place the buns under the broiler, buttered side up, until they are lightly toasted.
Once the vegetables are very soft, add the beef, cook approx 2 minutes or until the beef is no longer pink.  Do not overcook the beef.  Add the cheese whiz.  Stir in until melted.  Spoon the filling onto each bun and press the sandwich closed.  Dig in!
