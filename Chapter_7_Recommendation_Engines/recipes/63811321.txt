Ingredients:
1 pound fresh strawberries, washed, hulled, and cut lengthwise into 1/4- to 3/8-inch wedges
1/4 cup sugar
Pinch table salt
1/2 cup strawberry jam
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)

Directions:
Toss the berries, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and let stand until the berries have released some juice and the sugar has dissolved, about 30 minutes, tossing occasionally to combine.
2. Process the jam in a food processor until smooth, about 8 seconds. Transfer the jam to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until dark and no longer frothy, about 3 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, then gently stir the warm jam into the strawberries. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or up to 12. To serve, spoon a portion of the topping over individual slices of cheesecake
