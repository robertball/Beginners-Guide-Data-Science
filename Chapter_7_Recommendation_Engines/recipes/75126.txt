Ingredients:
3 zucchini, thinly sliced or shredded
1 cup all-purpose biscuit baking mix
4 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella or Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).
In a large bowl, toss zucchini with baking mix until well coated. Add beaten eggs, melted butter, and Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. Using a large spoon or your hands, work mixture together until well blended. Add onion, garlic, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper, and mix again. Spread mixture into a 13x9 inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and top is golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
Basically a casserole-type dish that is delicious when served right out of the oven, or even at room temperature. Leftovers can be reheated in the microwave and are good the next day, too. A wonderful side with burgers off the grill or as a quick main course with the addition of cubed ham or cooked, cubed chicken.
