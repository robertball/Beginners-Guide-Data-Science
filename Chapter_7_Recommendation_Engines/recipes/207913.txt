Ingredients:
2 quarts canola oil for frying
1 egg
3 tablespoons water
1 (16 ounce) jar pizza sauce
1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl.
Combine the pizza sauce and pepperoni in a blender or food processor.  Process until pepperoni is well chopped and the sauce has thickened. Transfer sauce to a large bowl, and stir in mozzarella.
Lay out one eggroll wrapper on work surface.  Place 1 tablespoon filling at the bottom center of the wrapper, leaving 1/2 inch border on each side.  Lightly brush the wrapper edges with the egg mixture.  Fold over both sides; roll up to encase filling in wrapper.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
Deep fry pizza rolls in batches until crisp and golden brown, 5-9 minutes.

Description: 
This is just the base for a basic pepperoni pizza roll. I made this with leftover pizza toppings.  I didn't feel like making any dough so I substituted egg roll wraps.
