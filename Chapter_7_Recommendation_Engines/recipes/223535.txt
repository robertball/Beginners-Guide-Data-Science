Ingredients:
2 (19 ounce) cans chickpeas (garbanzos), drained and rinsed
1 pint small cherry tomatoes, halved
3 tablespoons finely shredded basil leaves
1/2 cup crumbled goat-milk feta cheese
2 tablespoons honey
3 large cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Toss chickpeas, tomatoes, feta cheese, and basil together in a large mixing bowl.
Put honey in a small glass bowl; heat in microwave 30 seconds. Stir garlic, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar, olive oil, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt with the honey to make a dressing; pour over the chickpea salad and toss to coat.
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate salad for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
Delicious and inexpensive, this is a breeze to whip up. You will love this sunny salad packed with seasonal tomatoes, basil, and garlic. An awesome take-along salad for work with some whole-grain pita wedges or a whole-grain bun, or a nice side for grilled chicken, pork, or fish! I heat the salad dressing (before adding the chopped garlic) in the microwave 30 seconds to ensure the honey incorporates.
