1/4 cup peanut butter
1/3 (12 ounce) jar honey
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup granola
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 cup puffed rice cereal
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped dried mixed fruit

Directions:
Melt peanut butter and honey together in a saucepan over medium heat. Dissolve brown sugar into the peanut butter mixture; bring to a simmer for 2 minutes.
Mix granola, oats, rice cereal, chocolate chips, and fruit together in a large bowl; pour peanut butter mixture over the granola mixture and fold to coat.
Grease a cake pan. Pour the granola mixture into the prepared pan and press into a flat layer. Cool at room temperature until set, about 15 minutes before cutting into bars.
