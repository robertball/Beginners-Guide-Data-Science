Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1 tablespoon candy sprinkles

Directions:
Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Stir in the corn syrup until smooth. Scrape the mixture onto a plate; cover with wax paper. Allow the clay to rest overnight at room temperature.
Roll or shape the clay; decorate with candy sprinkles.
