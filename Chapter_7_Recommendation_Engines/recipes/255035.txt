Ingredients:
1 cup water
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 egg
3 1/2 cups White Lily® All Purpose Wheat Flour, or more as needed
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
Crisco® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray

Directions:
Place water, butter, egg, 3 cups flour blend, sugar, salt and yeast in bread machine pan in order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Dough/Manual cycle. During initial mixing cycle, open lid and scrape down sides of bread pan as necessary. As dough mixes, add just enough additional flour blend to create a soft dough. When Dough/Manual cycle is complete, remove dough from bread machine pan. Place on lightly floured surface.
Coat 13 x 9-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Pat dough into rectangle. Cut with pizza cutter or serrated knife into 15 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball. Place evenly in prepared pan. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 35 to 45 minutes.
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Uncover rolls. Bake 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm or cool completely on wire rack.
