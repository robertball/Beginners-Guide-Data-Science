Ingredients:
2 tablespoons mango powder (amchur)
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound large okra
1/4 cup corn flour
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Combine mango powder, ginger, cumin, turmeric, chili powder, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon oil together in a bowl; set aside for flavors to blend for 2 hours.
Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim okra and make a slit lengthwise down the side of each okra, creating a pocket. Fill each pocket with the spice mixture.
Place corn flour in a resealable plastic bag; add filled okra and shake to coat.
Fry okra in the hot oil until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer fried okra using a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate.
