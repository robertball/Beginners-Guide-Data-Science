Ingredients:
2 1/4 pounds bone-in pork loin chops
3 tomatoes, sliced
2 onions, sliced
3/4 cup shredded Gouda cheese
1 clove garlic, crushed
salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut pork into 1/4-inch slices lengthwise, stopping 1/2-inch from the bottom, so it can fan out like a book. Stuff tomatoes, onion, and Gouda cheese in between the slices.
Combine garlic and salt in a bowl, then stir in mustard and pepper. Spread mixture all over the pork. Press pork slices firmly together and wrap in aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until nicely browned, about 30 minutes more.
