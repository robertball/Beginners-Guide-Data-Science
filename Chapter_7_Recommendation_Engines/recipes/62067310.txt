Ingredients:
1/2 loaf of pumpernickel
1/2 loaf of rye bread
1/2 loaf of white
poultry seasoning
sage
1 cup of butter melted
1 package of pine nuts
1 large red onion
10-12 strips of bacon (uncooked or microwaved for 3 minutes) diced
1 package of dried apricots
plum sauce diced
4-5 tb of sage (you're using your nose)
2-3 tb of poultry seasoning

Directions:
Cube all the bread and put in one big mixing bowl. You may end up with 2 bowls. Dice the bacon, this is crucial because it won't cook if left too big. Dice the apricots & onion. Mix all the loose ingredients together. Your seasonings add generously. You want half as much poultry seasoning as your adding sage.  (1 poultry seasoning to 2 sage) This is a smelling process. You want to be able to smell the sage after it's mixed. If the smell goes away or dies you may want to add more. You can't really over season. It puts a zing in the stuffing. Add the melted butter and mix. The melted butter keeps the stuffing from drying out. Stuff your bird and coat it once with plum sauce. (trust me; the gravy from the drippings and plum sauce is to die for)

Description: 
This stuffing, had us eating it before the turkey was cooked and fighting over it when eating leftovers. I had guests over and there wasn't a peep @ the table. While the stuffing kept disappearing really fast. It's the best stuffing I've created and I'm drooling thinking about it now.
