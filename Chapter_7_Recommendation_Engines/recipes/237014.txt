Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups vegetable broth (such as Penzy'sÂ®)
2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour vegetable broth over the onion mixture; add tomatoes, 1 tablespoon cilantro, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the tomatoes are really soft, about 15 minutes.
Pour tomato mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth and return to the saucepan.
Put pureed soup over medium heat and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Stir remaining tablespoon cilantro and the heavy cream into the soup.

Description: 
This is the best to-die-for fire-roasted tomato soup! It can be made for Italian tastes or Mexican tastes! My favorite is the Mexican! Cilantro is the best! Use basil for the cilantro if you prefer an Italian flavor.
