Ingredients:
6 (3.5 ounce) links hot Italian sausage, removed from casings
1 onion, minced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
5 (3 ounce) andouille sausages, sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 stalks celery, sliced
1 zucchini, diced
1 yellow squash, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 orange bell pepper, diced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can Great Northern beans, undrained
1 (46 fluid ounce) can spicy vegetable juice (such as V8®)
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock (such as Kitchen Secrets®)
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon garlic pepper

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir Italian sausage, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add andouille sausage; cook and stir until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir celery, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and orange bell pepper in the hot oil until slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix the sausage mixture, black beans, Great Northern beans, vegetable juice, and chicken stock into vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer. Stir in tomato paste, oregano, basil, and garlic pepper; simmer until flavors blend, about 15 minutes.
