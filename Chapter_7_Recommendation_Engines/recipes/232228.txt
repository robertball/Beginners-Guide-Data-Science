Description: 
This is so delicious and addictive! It is also very healthy. It tastes very fresh with the lime and ginger kick at the end of the drink. If you want to save the pulp, juice the carrots and tomatoes in the beginning and then remove the pulp to save for soup. You can add broth and onions and garlic to the pulp and it makes a very tasty soup in minutes!
