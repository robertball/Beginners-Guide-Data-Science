Ingredients:
Brownie Layer:
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
Cream Cheese Layer:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 eggs
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Use an electric mixer to beat the 1 egg and the butter in a large bowl.  Beat in the cake mix until all crumbs are moistened. Pat mixture into the prepared baking dish.
Beat the cream cheese, 2 eggs, and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl. Pour over cake mixture in pan.
Bake in preheated oven until light golden brown, about 1 hour.  Brownies will fully set as they cool. When cooled completely, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.
