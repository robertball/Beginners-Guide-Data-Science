Ingredients:
1 acorn squash
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
½ teaspoon kosher salt
Fresh ground pepper
10 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced
1 large Fuji apple (any sweet apple works), peeled, cored, and cubed.
3 ½ cups vegetable broth (chicken broth works, too)
Optional garnish: Toasted squash seeds and fresh sage leaves

Directions:
Cut the acorn squash in half. Remove the soft center stringy pulp and seeds. Set the seeds aside to be toasted later.
Place the squash, cut side down on a large microwavable dinner plate. Add 3 tablespoons of water to the plate and microwave for 8 minutes to soften the squash.
While the squash is steaming, melt the butter in a large pot until browned and nutty in aroma. Add the chopped onion to the pan and sauté for 5 minutes. Season with the salt and add the sage leaves. Continue to cook the onions for another minute.
Carefully scoop the acorn squash from its skin and add to the soup pot along with the chopped apples and broth.
Bring the soup to a boil and then cover the pot with a lid. Reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cook the soup for 15 minutes.
Using an immersion hand blender or food processor, puree the soup until smooth.
Season the soup with additional salt if need.
Garnish each bowl with toasted squash seeds and fresh sage.
