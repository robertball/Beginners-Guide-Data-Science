Ingredients:
QUICK HOMEMADE PIZZA DOUGH:
1 pkg quick rise yeast
1 t sugar
1 c very warm water (120 - 130 degrees)
2 1/2 c flour
1/2 c grated Romano cheese
4 T cornmeal
PIZZA:
1 T olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 t minced garlic
1 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry ALTERNATIVELY:10 ounces fresh baby spinach, washed and dry
1/4 t dill weed
1 c tomato sauce
4 - 8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
15 pitted Kalamata olives

Directions:
PIZZA DOUGH:In a small glass bowl, dissolve the yeast with the sugar in the water. Cover and let it proof (start to foam), 10 minutes.
Place proofed yeast in a medium bowl, add the salt, flour, & grated cheese to the bowl. Stir to make this a soft dough.
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead dough until it's elastic - about 8 minutes.
Shape dough into a ball, place in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.
PIZZA FILLING:While dough is resting, heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.
Once the onion becomes translucent, add the minced garlic, spinach, and dill; heat through.
BACK TO THE PIZZA DOUGH:Preheat the oven to 450*F.
Lightly grease a 15-inch pizza pan then sprinkle with the cornmeal.
Roll the dough into a circle to fit the pan, then transfer to pan or pat the dough into the pan, shaping the dough into a 1/2-inch rim at the edge of the pan.
FINISH THE PIZZA:Spread the dough with the tomato sauce.
Top with the spinach mixture.
Sprinkle with the feta and olives.
Bake 15 to 20 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven.
