Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat.  Add onions and spinach and saute until translucent, about 15 minutes.  Add the flour and nutmeg and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes.  Add the cream and milk and cook until thickened.
Squeeze as much liquid as possible from the spinach and add the spinach to the sauce.  Parmesan and the Gruyere on top.  Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.  Serve immediately.
