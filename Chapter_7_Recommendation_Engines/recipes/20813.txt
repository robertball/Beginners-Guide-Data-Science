Ingredients:
3 cups water
3 cups rolled oats
1 tablespoon salt
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons shortening
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
6 1/2 cups bread flour

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat the water, oatmeal and salt until it bubbles. Add the brown sugar and shortening; stir until melted. Remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm.
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, oats mixture and 2 cups flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until loaf tops are golden brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
