Ingredients:
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
2 dried red chile peppers, cut in half
6 fresh curry leaves
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch asafoetida powder
2 cups cubed potatoes
salt to taste
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon peanut oil
6 cups chopped fresh spinach
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a skillet; fry the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and red chile peppers in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the curry leaves, turmeric, and asafoetida powder; fry another 30 seconds. Stir the potatoes into the mixture to coat; cook until they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. Sprinkle the water over the potatoes; cover the skillet with a lid and cook until the potatoes are cooked, but still firm, about 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a separate skillet; cook the spinach in the hot oil until wilted. Sprinkle with salt; continue cooking until all the excess moisture evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir into the potato mixture. Season with the ground red pepper and cumin; stir. Cook until the spices integrate, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite dry sabjis. If you like Aloo Methi, then you'll love this dish, too. Goes great with parathas or with some plain rice and ghee.
