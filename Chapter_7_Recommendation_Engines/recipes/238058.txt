Ingredients:
6 cups diced (1/2 inch) rhubarb
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread rhubarb into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish to cover the bottom completely. Sprinkle white sugar evenly over the rhubarb.
Mix flour, brown sugar, ginger, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Blend butter into the sugar mixture with a pastry cutter until the mixture forms crumbs the size of a small pea; spread over the rhubarb.
Bake in preheated oven until the top is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool crisp before serving.
