Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 large onion, diced
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/3 cup dry sherry
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash with milk and butter. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; saute until translucent. Add ground beef; cook, breaking up lumps with a wooden spoon, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add sherry; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low.
Season the beef mixture with salt and pepper, and stir in Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle in flour and mix well until mixture is thick and clings together, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Pour beef mixture into the bottom of a casserole dish. Spread mashed potatoes evenly across the top. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter 1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Press a fork into the edges of the casserole to make a pattern.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until piping hot and cheese is melted down, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Ground beef cottage pie with sherry and a fluffy mashed potato and cheese topping. I like to serve it with honey carrots and buttered sweet corn on the side. Can be made ahead or frozen ready for another time. [Originally submitted to Allrecipes.co.uk]
