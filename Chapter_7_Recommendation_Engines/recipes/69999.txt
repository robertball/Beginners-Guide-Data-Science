Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked brown rice
6 cups water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large white onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup chunky natural peanut butter

Directions:
Place rice and water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until rice is tender and water has absorbed, about 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion, and cook until soft and golden, stirring frequently. Add garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, and season with cayenne pepper. Increase heat to medium, and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in peanut butter and heat through. The mixture will thicken. Serve over rice.
