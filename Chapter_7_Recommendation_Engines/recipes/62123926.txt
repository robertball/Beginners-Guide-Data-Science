Ingredients:
1/2 a package of rotini pasta
1 package of ground beef or extra lean ground sirloin
4 plum tomatoes
1 medium sized carrot
1 onion
1 dash of red wine
2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder
3/4 cup water
1 pinch dried rosemary
1 dash of Italian seasoning
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
4-5 tbsp ketchup
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Dice the onion, carrot, and tomatoes. Dice the carrot into very small pieces.
In a pot, bring water to a boil. Add the pasta and a pinch of salt. Continue to boil for about 8 minutes or until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Heat up the olive oil in a deep pan and add the ground beef. Break it up and cook until half-brown; add the diced onions. Add the Italian seasoning, rosemary and sugar. Cover the pan with a lid and simmer on the lowest heat setting until the onions become translucent. Add 1 tsp salt.
Wait until the "sauce" has very little juice in it and then add in the red wine. Stir well.
Add the carrots and again cover with the lid. Continue to simmer on low heat until the carrots become soft.
In a bowl, mix the chicken bouillon and 3/4 cup of water together. Stir it into the sauce. Continue to simmer on low heat for 5 minutes.
Squeeze in the ketchup and stir well. Simmer for another 5 minutes or until you like the consistency of the sauce.
