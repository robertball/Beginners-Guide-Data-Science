Cheddar Cheese Fondue Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Cup Beer
2 Cups shredded cheddar and swiss cheeses
1 Tablespoon garlic, fresh and finely chopped
Dash of mustard powder
Dash of black pepper
Dash of worcestershire sauce
2 Tablespoons of Cornstarch
For Dipping I recommend the following:
Pieces of Granny Smith Apples
Pieces of Rye and Pumpernickel Breads
Pieces of Cauliflower and Carrots

Directions:
1. Prior to making the fondue, cut up whatever dipping items you want to use and place them on a tray. The fondue will be made when you are ready to serve.
2. Cut open a fresh garlic bulb and rub it on the surface of your hot fondue pot.
3. Add beer to fondue pot and let it warm up.
4. Combine cornstarch and cheese and then add them to the warmed beer. Add spices to the pot and mix until combined. Once the flavor is as you like it dip away and enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe is like the one from the Melting Pot. I figured out how to make it at home for way less money! The taste is just as good. This recipe works best on electric fondue pots, just be careful not to burn it as some fondue pots can get too hot. If you have that problem just keep your pot on low and turn it off every once in a while.
