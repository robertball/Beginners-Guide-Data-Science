Description: 
I developed this recipe while working at a restaurant. We wanted a salad that would complement a barbecue sandwich and use up day-old baked potatoes. It keeps well and seems to taste even better after being refrigerated.                                                              --Patricia Maul                                                           Battlesville, Oklahoma
