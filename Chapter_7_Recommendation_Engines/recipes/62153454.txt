Ingredients:
1 stick butter melted and separated into two 4 tbsp servings
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh thyme
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh tarragon
1 tbsp finely chopped fresh chives
1 1/2 cups panko (Japanese) bread crumbs
1/3 cup grated romano cheese
salt to taste
pepper to taste
2 1 lb salmon fillets cut in half
Juice of a half lemon.

Directions:
preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix herbs, panko, salt, pepper and grated cheese in a bowl then spread out on a baking sheet or sheet of wax paper.
Take half of the melted butter and dip each salmon fillet into it, then coat with panko mixture, pressing fillet into the panko mixture to make sure it adheres.
Place each fillet into a large, greased baking dish.
Sprinkle a little more panko mixture onto the fish to make sure it is well breaded.
Bake in oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes or until done (don't overcook). Finish under broiler for about a 30 seconds brown the topping.
Add lemon juice to remaining butter and serve over fish.

Description: 
The recipe uses Japanese panko breadcrumbs. Regular breadcrumbs will not work nearly as well.  The 4 herbs are just a suggestion, you can use whatever fresh herbs you like. Try fresh sage, fresh oregano or whatever your favorites are.
