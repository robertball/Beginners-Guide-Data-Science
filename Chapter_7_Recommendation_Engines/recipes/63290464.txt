Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
1 envelope of unflavored gelatin
1/2 c water
1 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 cup sour cream (the reduced fat kind works well)
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups of your choice of frozen or fresh fruit--strawberries, blueberries, melon, peaches, raspberries--whatever suits your fancy...

Directions:
Blend sugar and gelatin in a saucepan.  Add water and mix well.  Let stand for 5 minutes, then, stirring constantly, bring to a rolling boil.  Remove from heat. Add heavy cream and stir to blend.
In a bowl, mix sour cream and vanilla.
Pour gelatin/cream mixture into the bowl gradually and mix until smooth.
Cover and chill until set--at least 4 hours.
To serve, put some of the cream in a bowl and put fruit on top.
