Sweet Hot Mustard Chicken Wings Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
2 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded
salt to taste
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
3 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; coat the aluminum foil with cooking spray.
Arrange the wings on the prepared baking sheet so they do not touch; season with salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crispy on top, about 20 minutes. Flip the wings with tongs and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes more.
Stir together the Dijon mustard, yellow mustard, honey, cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and hot sauce in large mixing bowl. Add the wings to the bowl and toss with a spatula to coat evenly. Allow to sit for about five minutes and toss again to re-coat. Transfer to a plate to serve.

Description: 
If you are as burned-out on the basic Buffalo-style chicken wing recipe as I am, then this recipe's for you. The hot, sweet, mustardy glaze is a very welcome change of pace fromÂ traditional style. Enjoy!
