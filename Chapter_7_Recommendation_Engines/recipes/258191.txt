Ingredients:
Filling:
1 small onion, chopped
2 1/2 pounds ground chuck
2 teaspoons monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'centÂ®)
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 head cabbage, shredded
3 1/4 cups bread flour
Dough:
1 1/4 cups milk, slightly warmed
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/4 teaspoons bread machine yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cook and stir onion in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground chuck; cook and stir until browned, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Season with monosodium glutamate, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring often, until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Bring a lightly salted pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage; reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until cabbage is just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Fold into the ground chuck mixture.
Place bread flour, milk, all-purpose flour, egg, sugar, butter, bread machine yeast, and salt in the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Run "Dough" cycle.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Cut in half; roll each piece of dough to 1/3-inch thickness. Cut each piece into 5 smaller pieces.
Place a large spoonful of ground chuck-cabbage mixture in the center of each piece of dough. Fold dough over and seal around filling.
Arrange bierocks on greased baking sheets. Cover with a clean dish towel and place in a warm, dry place to rise for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake bierocks in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe comes from a childhood memory. My mom was no Julia Childs, let me tell you, more like Bridget Jones. But when she made bierocks, they were good. I tried a lot of bierock recipes, but most of them called for frozen dough (yuck!). I use a bread machine, but that is not necessary. Mom's were good, mine are great!
