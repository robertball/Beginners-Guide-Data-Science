Description: 
This recipe was made every Christmas Eve for dinner. It will always be a favorite of mine because it truly reminds me of family and of Christmas. The most important step in this recipe is the browning; it is what determines your gravy. You must brown this meat until it is very dark, but not burned. The browner the meat, the better the gravy. Take your time, and brown on medium to medium-low heat. My father is from a small town in Bavaria called Hof, and my mother is from Gelsenkirchen, which is in northwestern Germany. My paternal oma (grandma) made this with pickles and my maternal oma without the pickles. I preferred it without, even though I love pickles.
