Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2/3 cup red wine
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
6 cloves garlic, minced
12 leaves fresh basil, cut into ribbons and chopped
8 1-inch-thick loin lamb chops
sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix tomato paste, red wine, olive oil, garlic, and basil in a small bowl to make the marinade.
Place lamb chops in a glass or ceramic container; paint both sides thoroughly with the marinade. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate.
Wipe most the marinade off the lamb, leaving a light coating. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Grill lamb until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
