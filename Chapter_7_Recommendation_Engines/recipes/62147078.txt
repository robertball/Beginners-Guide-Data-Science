Ingredients:
2 1/4 tsp. yeast (this is 1 env. yeast)
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup scalded milk
2 T butter
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 additional cup all purpose flour (or up to 1 1/2 cups)
2 T. butter, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup dark cocoa
1 tsp. cinnamon
2 T. butter, melted
1 cup powdered sugar
2 T. milk or other liquid

Directions:
Combine yeast and flour, add warm water.  Let rest until doubled in volume.
Combine milk, butter, sugar, salt and whole wheat flour. When the mixture is warm (the scalded milk has cooled down), add the yeast mixture.
Add additional all purpose flour until dough forms into a ball by leaving the sides of the bowl.  Knead 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic on floured surface.
Place dough in greased bowl.  Cover.  Let rise until doubled, 45 mins. to 1 hour.
Punch dough down, let rest 10 minutes.
Roll dough on floured surface to a 12x20" rectangle. Spread with melted butter.  Combine sugar, cocoa powder, and cinnamon; sprinkle on dough.
Roll dough up jelly roll fashion.  Shape in a circle on a parchment papered pan. Cut dough into 16 slices, cutting only 3/4 way through dough.  Twist every other piece flat to the inside of the circle, and twist the other pieces flat to the outside of the circle.  Cover with plastic wrap,let rise til doubled, about 1/2 hour.
Bake in preheated 350 oven for 20 minutes, or until golden.
Remove from cookie sheet, let cool.
Combine melted butter, powdered sugar and liquid (maraschino cherry liquid makes this into a pink glaze).  Drizzle over coffeecake.
