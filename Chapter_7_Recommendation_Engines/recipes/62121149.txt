Ingredients:
1 double-pie flaky crust
2 medium size very UNRIPE papaya (to make 2 cups shredded papaya)
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
Dash of Salt
Dash of Cinnamon
1 egg yolk, scrambled

Directions:
Peel the papayas until there is no green visible.  Slice the ends off.  Half the papayas length-wise and clean the seeds out with a spoon.
Cut the papayas into chunks.  Little by little, grate/shred them in a blender until you have no remaining papaya chunks.
Dump the shredded papaya, sugars, and salt in a medium sauce pan and cook over medium heat until the sugars dissolve.  Stir often.  Dash with cinnamon, and remove from heat.  Drain juice with strainer.
Roll out the crust and make 24 4-inch circles.
Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of the circles and enclose them making a semi-circle. Press the edges with a fork and poke the top for ventilation.
Bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet, an inch apart, at a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Then brush the tops of half-baked pastits with egg yolk and bake another 15 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy.

Description: 
-candied papaya filled in crust-  This was something my mom made daily when I was growing up.  It was the most requested Saipan, MP pastry.  Even though she didn't have the chance to pass it on to us, I used my past experience and made this Chamorro concoction.  :).
