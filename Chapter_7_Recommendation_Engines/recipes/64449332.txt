Ingredients:
8-10 Cremini Mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder
1 teaspoon Oliver Oil
1/4 cup finely diced Onion
4 oz Crabmeat
1/3 cup diced Avacado
1 teaspoon Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb Seasoning
1/2 teaspoon Seasoning Salt
1 tablespoon shredded Parmigiano/Reggiano Cheese
2 tablespoons Lemon Tahini Dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove stems and any residual loose materials from mushrooms and wash thoroughly.  Place mushrooms on a greased cookie sheet and bake for 20 minutes.  Remove mushrooms from oven and place upside down on a plate to drain and cool.
While mushrooms are cooking, place olive oil and onions in a small frying pan and saute over medium heat, stirring frequently, until onions are opaque (3-5 mins).  Set aside to cool.
Pick through crabmeat to remove any shell pieces and place clean crabmeat in a medium bowl.  Add the cooled mushrooms, avacado, Mrs. Dash, seasoning salt, and cheese and lemon tahini dressing.  Stir gently, but thoroughly, until ingredients are well combined.
Placed cooled mushrooms on a flat surface and, using a teaspoon, fill each mushroom cap with a heaping spoonful of the crab mixture.
Stuffed mushrooms can be served at room temperature or chilled.
