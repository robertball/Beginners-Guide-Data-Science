Ingredients:
10-12 large fresh jalapenos
1 pound jumbo shrimp (14-16 per pound)
1 pound of peppered bacon
8 oz whipped cream cheese
12 green olives with pimentos
2 T "Better Than Bouillon" Chicken Base (see footnote)

Directions:
Prepare the jalapenos by slitting and deseeding. Remove the bulk of the stem. Best to use plastic gloves during this stage.
If your shrimp have not come pre-cooked and shelled, prepare (steam) and shell & devein them, except for the tails.
Mince the green olives.
Combine minced olives, bouillon paste, and cream cheese in a small bowl.
Separate strips of bacon into a pile for ease of use.
After mixing the cream cheese filling, fill a piping bag with the mixture (a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off works well also).
Fill each pepper about a third full in a line lengthwise along the bottom. Use a spoon or a finger to press the filling to the bottom.
Insert a whole jumbo shrimp with the tail facing up into the back of the pepper so the tail and stem are on the same end. Cut another piece of shrimp in half and use another half shrimp to fill the tip end of the pepper.
Pipe in the rest of the pepper cavity with the filling.
Wrap in a single slice of bacon, and fasten with a toothpick through the middle. The bacon will constrict upon baking making the whole thing hold together nicely.
Bake in a preheated oven at 375 for 25-30 minutes.

Description: 
If you like bacon, shrimp, and like things spicy (in this case fresh jalapenos), this is for you.

It's great as an appetizer or a heavy hors d'oeuvre, and best of all, almost no carbs.
