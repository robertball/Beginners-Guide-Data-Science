1 pound ditalini, cooked and rinsed in cold water
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a very large soup pot, brown sausage in olive oil until cooked through.
Add garlic to the pan and saute for about 2 minutes.
Add carrots, broth and tomatoes to the pan. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 15 minutes.
Stir in cannelini and zucchini. Cover and simmer another 15 minutes or until zucchini is tender.
Add spinach and ditalini.  Heat just long enough to cook the spinach and heat the pasta.  Serve with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is my absolute favorite soup!  It is very stocky with sausage, carrots, zucchini and pasta and makes a very hearty meal.  It freezes well.
