Ingredients:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
3 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1 cup eggnog
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Combine the graham cracker crumbs, 3 tablespoons white sugar, and butter in a bowl and mix until evenly moistened; press into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Cream together the cream cheese and 1 cup sugar using an electric mixer. Add the flour and beat until smooth. Mix in the eggs with the mixer switched to low. Pour in the eggnog and vanilla; continue beating until just blended. Stop the mixer and scrape the bottom of the bowl occasionally. Pour the mixture over the crust.
Fill a shallow dish with some hot water and place on bottom rack of the oven. Put cheesecake on the middle rack of the oven. Turn oven heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Do not preheat oven.
Bake the cheesecake until the center is set, about 3 hours 15 minutes. Turn oven off. Allow cheesecake to cool in the oven, about 3 hours. Chill in refrigerator overnight.

Description: 
This is a wonderful cheesecake. The eggnog doesn't overpower the cheesecake and the cheesecake doesn't overpower the eggnog. The result is sinfully smooth and delicious!
