Ingredients:
1 lb ground meat (pork, chicken, turkey, beef)
16 oz of finely shredded white cabbage
1 bunch of green onions
2 tbsp fresh ginger
4 tbsp schezwan or teriyaki sauce
1 16 oz package egg roll wraps

Directions:
Brown meat in a large skillet, add oil of your choice as needed.  After browned, add ginger and schezwan sauce, combine.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
In a large mixing bowl combine cabbage and sliced green onions (use most of the green).  Combine meat mixture throughly.
Lay out one wrap on dry counter top, scoop 1/3 cup of mixture into the middle of the wrap.  Fold corners into the middle, the tips touching. Tightly fold the corner pointing toward you over the two touching points.  Wet the tip of the opposite corner with water and roll tightly to close the roll.  The wet tip will adhere to the outside of the roll.  Set on baking sheet (or other dry surface) while wrapping the rest of the rolls.
Heat fryer (peanut oil is best) to 350 degrees. Fry 4 to 5 rolls at one time for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.  Lay fried rolls on baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain.
Place finished rolls back on baking sheet and freeze for a few hours.  Package rolls in freezer safe bags.  to re-heat bake in 350 degree oven for 5-10 minutes.

Description: 
These can be made with any kind of meat - I usually use chicken and pork. They are more meaty than restaurant rolls, but we like them that way.  After lightly frying them, I freeze them and then reheat in the oven when needed.
