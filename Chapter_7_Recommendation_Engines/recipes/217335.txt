Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk
1 (3 ounce) package seasoned coating mix (such as SHAKE-N-BAKEÂ®)
1 pound bulk pork sausage
6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour milk into a shallow dish; empty the packet of seasoned coating into a large plastic zipper bag. Divide the pork sausage into 6 equal portions, and cover each egg completely with a layer of sausage. Roll the sausage and egg balls in the milk, and place in the plastic bag. Seal the bag, and gently shake until balls are covered with seasoned coating. Place the coated sausage and egg balls onto a rack over a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and slightly crisp, about 30 minutes.
