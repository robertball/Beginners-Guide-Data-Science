Ingredients:
FOR THE DOUGH:
1 cup water
1/4 cup butter, cut up
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon koshar salt
1 egg, room temperature
1 package rapid rise yeast
3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
FOR THE FILLING:
1/3 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon cardamom
FOR THE CARAMEL SAUCE:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup corn syrup
3/4 cup dark brown sugar

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat and stir the water and 1/4 cup butter until just warm and the butter almost melts (105 - 115 degrees F). In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, salt, egg, yeast and butter mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir in 1 3/4 cups of the flour. Then, stir in as much of the remaining 4 cups of flour as you can.
Turn the dough out onto floured surface and knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft, and elastic dough (3-5 min). Lightly oil a medium sized bowl and set aside. Shape the dough into a ball and place in the oiled bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled in size (about an hour)
Punch dough down and turn out onto floured surface. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Grease a 13x9 baking pan; set aside. Heat 1/2 c. butter, 1/4 c. corn syrup and 3/4 c. brown sugar in pan on low until melted. Pour sauce into prepared pan. In small bowl, mix 3/4 c. brown sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. cardamom. Set aside.
Roll dough into 18x10 in. rectangle. Spread with 1/3 c. butter. Sprinkle with sugar mixture. Tightly roll into log from the long side. Pinch seams to seal.
Cut dough crosswise into 12 slices. Arrange slices, cut side down in prepared pan. **Cover and let rise in warm place until nearly doubled (about 30-40 min).
Bake rolls in 350 F oven for about 30 min. or until golden brown. Invert rolls onto a jelly roll pan.
