Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup walnuts
3 Tblsp. egg white (or meringue) powder
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup plain rice flour
3 Tblsp. corn starch
1 pound shrimp (size 31 or more per lb.), peeled & deveined
1/4 cup + 2 Tblsp. mayonnaise
3 tablespoons honey
1-1/2 tablespoon canned sweetened condensed milk
vegetable oil for frying
Optional Garnish: tops of green onions, sliced

Directions:
Stir together the 1/2 c. water and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and add the walnuts. Boil for 2 minutes, then drain and place walnuts on a cookie sheet to dry.
Whip egg white powder with 1/2 water in a medium bowl until foamy. Stir in the rice flour & corn starch until it has a pasty consistency. Heat the oil in a heavy deep skillet over medium-high heat (to 350 F). Dip shrimp into the batter, and then place one at a time into the hot oil. Fry in small batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; optionally keep warm in low (toaster) oven.
Optionally fry the airdried nuts for about 5 seconds in the hot oil.
In a medium saucepan, stir together the mayonnaise, honey and sweetened condensed milk. Heat it a little. Add shrimp and toss to coat with the sauce. Serve atop rice or shredded lettuce or cabbage. Sprinkle the candied walnuts (& optional green onion) on top.
