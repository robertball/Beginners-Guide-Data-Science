Ingredients:
Cheesecake:
8 oz. of Organic Valley cream cheese / 8 oz. Organic Valley Neufchatel cheese, softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 Arrowhead Mills graham pie crust
__________________________________________________
Lemon Curd:
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
Â½ cup sugar
3 eggs
1 tablespoon finely shredded lemon zest
4 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Cheesecake:
Preheat oven to 350, beat cream cheese, sugar, eggs, vanilla, lemon juice until smooth.
Pour into crust. Bake 25 min. Cool in refrigerator for 6 hrs.
-----------------------------------------------------
Lemon Curd:
In a double-boiler, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and lemon juice until blended. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes thick (160 degrees F or 71 degrees C). This will take approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately pour through a fine strainer to remove any lumps. Cut the butter into small pieces and whisk into the mixture until the butter has melted. Add the lemon zest and let cool. The lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Cover immediately (so a skin doesn't form) and refrigerate for up to a week.
Top pie with lemon curd and whipped cream before serving.

Description: 
Cheesecake Pie with a lemon curd and whipped cream topping. I use a lemon curd recipe from epicurious for a different recipe but with slightly less sugar (this is also a great recipe): Meyer Lemon Shortcakes with Meyer Curd and Mixed Citrus.
I believe the cheesecake pie portion is a modified version of the standard cheesecake pie.
