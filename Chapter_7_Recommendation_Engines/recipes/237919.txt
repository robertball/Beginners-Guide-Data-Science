Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup shredded coconut, divided
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1/4 cup sliced almonds, divided
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
1 pinch ground allspice (optional)
2 tablespoons virgin coconut oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup unpopped popcorn
3/4 cup chocolate chips
1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil
1 tablespoon shortening
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, sifted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Melt 1 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt into melted butter; bring to a boil, stirring constantly, reduce heat to low, and simmer caramel sauce without stirring until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir 1/3 cup coconut, peanuts, 2 tablespoons almonds, vanilla extract, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice into caramel.
Heat 2 tablespoons coconut oil, 1 tablespoon butter, and vegetable oil together in a large pot over high heat. Pour popcorn into hot oil, cover the pot with a lid, and shake pot constantly over heat until all popcorn is popped, 1 to 3 minutes.
Pour caramel sauce over hot popcorn and quickly stir to coat. Turn popcorn out onto prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle 1/3 cup coconut and remaining 2 tablespoons almonds over popcorn.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Broil popcorn until coconut and popcorn are lightly toasted, about 30 seconds.
Melt chocolate chips, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, and shortening together in a saucepan until all are melted and the chocolate sauce is thin and pourable. Drizzle chocolate sauce and sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup coconut over popcorn; dust with confectioners' sugar. Lift parchment paper off of the baking sheets and transfer popcorn to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Break into palm-sized chunks and store in airtight containers.

Description: 
Coconut, almonds, and chocolate enhance classic caramel corn in this recipe. This popcorn has a rich, melt-in-your mouth, crunchy addictiveness that causes people to use such words as 'crack' and 'sinful'.
