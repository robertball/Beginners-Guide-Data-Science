Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 4 large chicken breasts)
2 16oz jars of salsa (I normally use Medium Tostitos Salsa)
1 can diced green chiles (optional)
1 tsp red pepper flakes
2 cans black beans, drained and rinsed
Shredded Mexican cheese (optional)
Sour cream (optional)
Rice, tortillas, or corn chips (optional) - I love it with Lime Tostitos!
Fresh lime juice (optional)
Avocado chunks (optional)
Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Pour half of salsa into dutch oven to coat bottom (I use an enameled cast iron dutch oven.  Lay chicken breasts on top of salsa.  Pour remaining salsa on top of chicken so it is coated.  (OPTIONAL: Add can of diced chiles.) Sprinkle red pepper flakes over chicken.
Bake at 325 degrees for approximately 1 hour 30 min.  Check that chicken is cooked through - if it isn't, continue cooking in 15 minute increments until cooked through.
Remove from oven, shred chicken with 2 forks, add black beans, and mix well.  Bake for an additional 15 minutes.
Remove from oven.  Serve on its own, or with rice/tortillas/corn chips, shredded cheese, sour cream, fresh lime juice, avocado chunks, and/or fresh chopped cilantro.
