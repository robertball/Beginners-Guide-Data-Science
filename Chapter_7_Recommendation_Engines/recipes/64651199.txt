1 teaspoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground oregano
2 teaspoons black pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder (not garlic salt)

3 tablespoons paprika
3 tablespoons poultry seasoning

Description: 
As a diabetic, I try to stay away from potatoes but it's one of my favorite comfort foods.  Using cauliflower instead of potatoes, and making a few other substitutes, turns this side dish into something I can enjoy without guilt.
