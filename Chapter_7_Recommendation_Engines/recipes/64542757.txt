Ingredients:
2 cups almond meal
2 tbsp coconut sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp sea salt + more for salting
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
6 tbsp coconut oil, melted
2 tbsp blackstrap molasses
3 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp reduced sugar maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Prepare a baking sheet with a slip mat or parchment paper
In a large bowl, mix together almond flour, coconut sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt, baking soda, baking powder
Be sure to loosen any clumps in the flour mixture, I used a fork to mix and break up fine
Then in a separate, small bowl add molasses, coconut oil, vanilla extract and maple syrup
Combine liquids with a fork just until they slightly blend, do not over mix otherwise coconut oil will harden
In the bowl with the flour mixture, create a well in the center of the flour and add liquid
With a baking spatula, fold the flour over the liquid multiple times over and over until you have a gooey dough mixture and it appears all ingredients are thoroughly blended
With a small ice cream scoop, place one tablespoon of mixture onto the baking sheet
Bake 10-12 minutes until hardened on the outside, the center may still be a bit undercooked but that is ok
Remove from the oven immediately sprinkle a bit of salt on each cookie
Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet another 2-3 minutes before removing and placing on a cooling rack to bake completely
