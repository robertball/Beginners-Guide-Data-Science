Ingredients:
1/2 yellow onion, sliced
4 pork chops
26 ounces condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/4 cup water
2 cubes beef bouillon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place sliced onion pieces on the bottom of a glass baking dish. Lay pork chops over the onions. Cover chops evenly with cream of mushroom soup. Add water and bouillon to the top, breaking up bouillon cubes to get the flavor spread out. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring the gravy once or twice, until no longer pink in the centers, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
When done right, these baked pork chops are fork-tender. Great comfort food for cold days! The cream of mushroom soup gravy is great on both the pork chops and mashed potatoes.
