Directions:
slice your bacon into small strips and chop your apple and onion. Saute' them together for about 5 minutes. add the tomato puree and flour, broth and pineapple juice from the can, stirring often for around 10 minutes on medium low. Remove from heat and add salt to taste and pineapple. Wrapping your chicken breasts with plastic wrap or parchment paper, pound out your chicken breast so that they are about 3/4 inch. This helps break the breast down to absorb more of the sauce as it cooks. place in glass baking dish and pour curry sauce over. Bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes at 350 until chicken is done. After removal from oven, garnish with the pineapple rings. Great served over white rice.
