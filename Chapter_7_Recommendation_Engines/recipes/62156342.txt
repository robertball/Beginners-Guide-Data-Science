Lemony Pork Piccata Recipe

Ingredients:
4 pork chops (cut from a boneless tenderloin)
1 T fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste
2 T sliced shallots or sweet onions
1 clove minced garlic (if using onions instead of shallots) optional
3 T unsalted butter
1/3 cup dry white wine
4 T chicken stock
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 T lemon zest
1 T capers

Directions:
1. Pound pork chops between 2 sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap until very thin (about 1/8 inch).
2. Dredge pork in the seasoned flour. Shake off any excess.
3. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When butter sizzles, add the shallots, (or onions and garlic) and pork. Do not overcrowd the pan. You may have to do 2 separate batches. Depending on the thickness of the meat, saute 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and almost cooked through. Hold in a warm oven (300 degrees) for approx 20-25 minutes, tented with foil, until completely tender. Time in oven depends on thickness-may be less.
4. When ready to serve, deglaze pan with wine and chicken stock, making sure to stir up the brown bits. Raise heat to high and simmer briskly until reduced by half. Stir in the lemon juice and serve immediately drizzled over the pork.
5. Sprinkle the pork generously with parsley, capers and lemon zest.
