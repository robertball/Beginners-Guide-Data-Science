Ingredients:
3 cups of cooked sweet potatoes (you can use canned)
1 cup white sugar
3 large eggs beaten
1/2 cup milk (I used heavy cream as I had some left over)
1/2 cup melted butter
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Topping
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/3 cup flour
1 cup roughly chopped pecans
1/3 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat over to 400 degrees.  Lightly spray a 9 x 13 pan with vegtable oil.
Using a hand mixer mix mashed sweet potatoes with sugar, eggs, milk, butter, vanilla and cinnamon until well blended.  When mixed well pour into 9 x 13 greased pan.
Prepare topping by mixing brown sugar, flour, pecans and melted butter.  When combined spread over souffle mixture in pan.
