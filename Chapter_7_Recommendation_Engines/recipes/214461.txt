Ingredients:
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or more if needed
1 small apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/4 small onion, minced
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir the tuna, olive oil, mayonnaise, apple, onion, relish, and dill together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Season with salt and pepper. You can serve immediately, though is tastes much better after being refrigerated overnight.

Description: 
I grew up eating a similar tuna salad, I have since adjusted it to be a little healthier than before. The apples make it fresh and delicious! Serve on bread of your choice with lettuce. Yum!
