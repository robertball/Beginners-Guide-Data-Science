1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3 cups water, or more as needed

Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
This is basically sweet, caramelized milk. It's so easy and so delicious. I like it better than caramel sauce on anything  you'd use caramel sauce, such as on ice cream, toast, cookies, cakes, brownies, or to pour on people.
