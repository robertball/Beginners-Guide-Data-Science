Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat or white flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste
2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins or strips
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 (12 ounce) jar quartered marinated artichoke hearts, with liquid
1/4 cup capers
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, and white and black peppers. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour and shake off excess.
Heat canola oil and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, and no longer pink on the inside; set aside.
Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve the caramelized bits. Add artichoke hearts and capers, return to a simmer, and cook until reduced by half.
Whisk butter into sauce until melted. Place cooked chicken back into pan, and simmer in the sauce for a few minutes to reheat. Serve on a platter sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley.
