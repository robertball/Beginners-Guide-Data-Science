Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
1/2 c. finely chopped yellow onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tbsp. chili powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. sea salt
2 c. homemade chicken stock
3/4 c. organic tomato paste (1 ½ six-ounce cans)

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent (4-5 minutes). Then add garlic and stir until fragrant (about 1 minute).
Add chili powder, cumin, oregano and salt. Stir using a wooden spoon, cooking for about 30 seconds.
Add chicken stock and tomato paste, continuing to stir to combine.
Bring sauce to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low and allow to gently simmer covered for 15 minutes.
Adjust the seasonings, adding more salt to taste and additional chili powder to increase heat, if desired.
If you prefer a non-chunky sauce, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much sauce as possible.
Then serve atop your favorite enchiladas.
