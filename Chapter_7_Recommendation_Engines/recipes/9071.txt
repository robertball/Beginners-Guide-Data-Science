Description: 
Eat to your heart's content the day after and/or freeze in several units. Take out of the freezer and heat in the zapper or in a double boiler. Enjoy that T-Day turkey until New Year's. Despite the name it is a really great soup that my sister's friend shared with me. This recipe is meant to use up any leftover vegetables and other ingredients; leftover green beans would make a great addition. Celery, onions, spinach and cabbage are tasty, too!
