Poblano Poppers Recipe

Ingredients:
1 tsp. butter
1 tsp. olive oil
4 oz. button mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4 scallions, chopped
2 Tbsp. fresh parsley
8 oz. light cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, to taste
6 large poblano peppers

Directions:
Preheat oven to broil. Make sure your oven rack is right under the broiler.
In a large heated pan, melt the butter and add olive oil. Add the mushrooms, garlic and scallions and saute for about 10 minutes, until the mushrooms release their liquid and dry again. Turn off the stove and add the parsley. Let the mushroom mixture cool for five minutes.
In a medium-sized bowl, combine the mushroom mixture, cheeses and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.
Prepare the poblanos by chopping off the tops. Using a small spoon, scrape out the seeds and membranes. Stuff the peppers and put on a foil-lined cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick spray.
Place the cookie sheet on the top rack and broil for 8-10 minutes, turning once halfway through broiling.

Description: 
This recipe was an accidental creation. I had leftover stuffed mushroom filling and we had a bunch of poblano peppers we needed to use after cleaning up our garden. It's now one of my family's favorite appetizers!!
