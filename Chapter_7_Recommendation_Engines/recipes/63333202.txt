Ingredients:
6 small yellow summer squash, trimmed and coarsely chopped
1 large zucchini, trimmed and coarsely chopped
2 cups vegetable stock/ chicken stock mix
1 cup yogurt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese for garnish
ground white pepper to taste
coarse sea salt to taste
2 tablespoons lemon juice, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon

Directions:
Place the summer squash, zucchini, vegetable stock, half-and-half, and tarragon into a large soup pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until nearly smooth, and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.
stir until thoroughly mixed. Stir in the lemon juice, and top with a sprinkling of cheese and tarragon to serve.
