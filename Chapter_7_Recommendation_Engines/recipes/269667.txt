Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon adobo seasoning
1 pinch ground black pepper
12  chicken drumsticks

Directions:
Line a baking dish with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
Combine mayonnaise, garlic, adobo seasoning, and pepper in a large bowl. Add drumsticks and turn to coat. Arrange drumsticks in the baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake chicken in the preheated oven, covered, until falling off the bone, about 2 hours. Uncover and continue baking until browned, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Simple and delicious, this goes alongside any pasta or potato dish. This may sound strange, but the mayonnaise turns back into oil while it's being cooked and creates a tender, yummy, fall-off-the-bone chicken. Most all of the fat is left behind in the pan, so it's really no worse than frying. Lining the pan with aluminum foil means almost no cleanup!
