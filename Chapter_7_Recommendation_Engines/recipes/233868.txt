Ingredients:
8 slices bison bacon
2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 tablespoon butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cook bison bacon over medium heat in a large skillet for 5 to 6 minutes or until crisp, turning occasionally. If necessary, drain on paper towels. Cool slightly. Cut into bite-size pieces; set aside.
Spread Brussels sprouts in a single layer in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Drizzle with oil. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until crisp-tender, stirring once or twice.
Meanwhile, for glaze, melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Cook garlic in hot butter for 30 seconds. Add balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir for 5 to 7 minutes or until sauce is thickened and reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add Brussels sprouts to skillet; stir to coat.
To serve, sprinkle bison bacon pieces over Brussels sprouts.
