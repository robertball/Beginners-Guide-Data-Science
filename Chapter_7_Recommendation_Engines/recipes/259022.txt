Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups raisins
1 (15 ounce) can unsweetened pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup oat flour
1 cup spelt flour
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 cup coconut flour
1/4 cup amaranth flour
1/4 cup brown rice flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 11x13-inch baking pan.
Place raisins in a pot, cover with water, and simmer until soft, 20 to 30 minutes.
Drain raisins and place in a blender. Add pureed pumpkin, eggs, and oil; blend everything until pureed.
Combine oat flour, spelt flour, almond meal, coconut flour, amaranth flour, brown rice flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl. Pour in pumpkin mixture and stir until well combined. Fold in pecans. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
