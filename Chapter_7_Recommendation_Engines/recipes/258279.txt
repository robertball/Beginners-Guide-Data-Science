Ingredients:
3/4 cup hazelnuts
4 (5 ounce) cans salmon, drained
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup Greek yogurt
1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped carrot
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped

3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon minced French tarragon leaves
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread hazelnuts onto a baking sheet.
Toast hazelnuts in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Rub hot hazelnuts using a clean dishtowel to remove skins. Cool for 5 minutes. Chop.
Combine hazelnuts, salmon, mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, red bell pepper, carrot, celery, hard-boiled eggs, onion, parsley, Dijon mustard, tarragon leaves, lemon juice, garlic salt, salt, and habanero pepper in a large bowl.
