Ingredients:
1 14 oz.can San Marzano tomatoes (this is extremely important).
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. onion powder
1 can tomato paste (optional)

Directions:
Pour the tomatoes into a bowl. cut the tops off the tomatoes and try to get rid of most of the seeds. Squish them with your hands or you can do a coarse blend on a food processor. If it's too watery for your taste then you can add tomato paste a little at a time to your desired consistency.
No need to cook the sauce because it cooks with the pizza.

Description: 
Authentic pizza sauce doesn't have a bunch of ingredients. It should be simple and the tomatoes should be the star. Add a little chopped basil to kick it up if you'd like.
