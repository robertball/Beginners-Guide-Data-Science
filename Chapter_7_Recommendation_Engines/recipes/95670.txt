Description: 
A blend of whole berry cranberry sauce, apple pie filling, and sliced pears.  Perfect for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Goes great with ham, turkey or chicken.  Yum!  Simple but delicious -- you'll get many compliments.  Just don't tell anyone how easy it was! This makes a lot.  You can halve it, but will end up with 1/2 a can of apple pie filling.  (Although, it probably wouldn't hurt to put in the entire can.)
