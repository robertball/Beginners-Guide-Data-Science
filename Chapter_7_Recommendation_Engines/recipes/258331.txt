Ingredients:
4 large firm pears - peeled, cored, and quartered
1/2 cup white sugar
peel of 1 orange
1 cinnamon stick
1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine

Directions:
Place pears in a saucepan. Add sugar, orange peel, and cinnamon stick. Pour in red wine to cover pears completely. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer gently until pears are soft and deep red in color, about 2 1/2 hours.
Transfer pears to a serving plate using a slotted spoon. Serve the pears warm or cold.

Description: 
A simple, but delicious recipe for poached pears in red wine. You only need a handful of ingredients. You can eat the pears as a dessert, warm or cold, but in the Netherlands we traditionally eat stewed pears as a side dish for Christmas. I prefer them cold.
