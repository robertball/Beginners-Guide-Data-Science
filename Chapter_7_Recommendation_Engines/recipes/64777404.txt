3.  On a cookie sheet, cut each slice of bread into 4 pieces.  Spread mixture evenly over each piece of bread.

Description: 
Great party appetizer that is cheesy, creamy and has a medium garlic flavor, and a family favorite of mine since I was a kid.  This recipe has never left a party with any on the plate.
