Ingredients:
3 cups sliced fresh peaches
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups self-rising flour, or as needed
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon raw sugar, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stir peaches with lemon juice in a bowl to prevent fruit from browning. Transfer to a cast iron skillet and stir in 1 1/2 cup white sugar, pecans, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Bring to a soft boil, stirring often.
Whisk self-rising flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Stir melted butter into the mixture (batter should resemble cooked oatmeal). Spoon batter over hot peach filling in the skillet; dot topping with 2 tablespoons of butter pieces and sprinkle with raw sugar.
Bake cobbler in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Homemade peach cobbler with fresh-picked peaches baked in a cast iron skillet. Serve with your favorite ice cream, (my husband loves pecan pralines and cream).  I made this recipe up because I was ready to be finished with the peaches! LOL! You can use any baking type dish you like. It was old fashioned and baked nicely in the cast iron skillet.
