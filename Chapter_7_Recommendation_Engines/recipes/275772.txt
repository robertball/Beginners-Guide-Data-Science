Ingredients:
2 green tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup plain panko bread crumbs
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Season tomato slices with salt and pepper.
Set up a breading station in 3 shallow dishes: pour flour into the first dish; stir together buttermilk and eggs in the second dish; and mix breadcrumbs, cornmeal, garlic powder, and paprika together in the third dish.
Dredge tomato slices in flour, shaking off the excess. Dip tomatoes into the egg mixture, and then into the bread crumb mixture, making sure to coat both sides.
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the fryer basket with olive oil. Place breaded tomato slices in the fryer basket, making sure they do not touch each other; cook in batches if necessary. Brush the tops of tomatoes with olive oil.
Cook for 12 minutes, then flip the tomatoes and brush again with olive oil. Cook until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes more. Remove tomatoes to a paper towel-lined rack to keep crisp. Repeat with remaining tomatoes.

Description: 
Fried green tomatoes are about as southern as you can get, comfort food at its best. An air fryer will allow you to put a healthier, but still totally delicious, version on the table.
