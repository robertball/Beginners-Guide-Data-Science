1/4 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 1/4 pounds New York strip steak, thinly sliced into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons butter
2 (10 ounce) bags frozen broccoli rice
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, or to taste (optional)

Whisk together beef broth, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, oyster sauce, cornstarch, and brown sugar in a bowl until cornstarch and sugar are dissolved.
Place sliced steak in a separate bowl and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. Stir until evenly coated.
