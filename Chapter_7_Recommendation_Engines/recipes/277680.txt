Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground marjoram
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Combine ground pork, sage, salt, crushed red pepper, marjoram, black pepper, onion powder, and thyme leaves in a large bowl; mix until evenly combined. Form mixture into 10 small patties.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook patties for 3 minutes. Flip and cook 3 minutes more or until juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (73 degrees C). Transfer patties to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess grease.
