Description: 
This is a wonderful appetizer, a bean spread with a Mexican taste. It looks very festive with the red and green toppings, and it's easy to put together. Your guests will be asking for the recipe, so keep it handy ! The two cheeses can be substituted with one 3-cup package shredded taco cheese.
