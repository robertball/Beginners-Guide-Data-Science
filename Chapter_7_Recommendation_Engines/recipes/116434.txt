Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup chopped pecans
LEMON FROSTING:
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter, melted
2 drops yellow food coloring (optional)

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar; beat in milk. Combine flour and cornstarch; gradually add to creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle.
Roll dough into 1-in. balls. Dip each ball halfway into pecans. Place nut side down 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten slightly. Bake at 350 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool. In a small bowl, combine frosting ingredients until smooth. Frost cooled cookies.

Description: 
Lemon frosting gives my delicate cream-colored butter cookies a special zest. The citrusy hint of sunshine is extra welcome in winter, and crispy pecans fill every delicious bite.
