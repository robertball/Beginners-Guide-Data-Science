Description: 
This can use leftover chicken or chicken breasts. I usually make it the day after we have roast chicken. The recipe calls for baking, but the ingredients can also be added to a slow cooker and cooked on Low for 7 hours. We serve this with cheese, tortilla chips, sour cream, salsa, black olives, and guacamole.
