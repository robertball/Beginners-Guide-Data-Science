Ingredients:
1 package English muffins (you'll need 6 English muffins)
6 slices Canadian bacon
6 eggs
6 slices American cheese
2 T butter

Directions:
Preheat a large skillet on medium heat.  Melt 2 T butter in skillet.
Crack open one egg into a small bowl.  Beat with a fork until blended.  Pour into heated skillet.  Gently pull at sides of egg to make it about the size of an English muffin.  You want your egg to be in one piece like an omelet.  If necessary, flip egg over to finish cooking.  Repeat with rest of eggs.
After eggs are cooked, assemble each muffin as follows:
Split open English muffin, place 1 slice cheese, 1 slice Canadian bacon, 1 cooked egg on one half of the muffin and top with other half.  Wrap in plastic wrap.  Repeat steps with rest of muffins.
Store all wrapped breakfast muffins in a freezer bag or freezer container.
To cook a muffin, thaw it in refrigerator over night.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Wrap muffin loosely in aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes.

Description: 
These are just as good as the breakfast sandwiches from a famous fast food restaurant.  I scramble the eggs individually but to save time you can scramble them together.  Best of all they can be frozen!
