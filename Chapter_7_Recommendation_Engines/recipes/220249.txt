Description: 
This easy-to-make casserole was a hit at my house! I used leftovers for part of it, which is always a plus, and it all went together so well. As for the pasta, we had a mix of cooked bow ties, elbows and spirals and they worked great! My 16-month-old daughter loved it, and the leftovers reheated beautifully the next day. Hope you like it as much as we did!
