Ingredients:
2 Cups Milk (any kind is fine but the less fat in the milk the longer it will take)
3 Tbsp Butter
2/3 Cup sugar
2 Tsp Vanilla (optional)

Directions:
Turn the crockpot on high
Mix milk and sugar in the crockpot.
Cook for 3 hours or until desired consitancy. Stir about every 10 minutes when it is almost done, to prevent burning on the bottom.
Add in the butter and let cool.
