Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 1/2 cups diced carrots
2 1/2 cups diced celery
2 1/2 cups diced onions
2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
1 1/2 tablespoons dried parsley, or to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste
6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon hot water

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat; add garlic and pepper. Cook and stir mixture until garlic is fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir carrots, celery, and onions into the butter, increase heat to medium, and continue to cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir crushed tomatoes, parsley, and sugar into the vegetable mixture. Reduce heat to low and cook mixture at a simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese and simmer to melt the cheese, about 5 minutes more.
Whisk cornstarch into hot water in a small bowl; add to sauce. Stir the cornstarch slurry into the sauce and cook until the sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes more.

Description: 
A delicious mix of veggies and cheese make for a surprisingly hearty and easy meal, despite all the chopping.  I'm not a vegetarian and I can eat this as a meal without missing meat one bit! Serve on thin spaghetti or capellini.
