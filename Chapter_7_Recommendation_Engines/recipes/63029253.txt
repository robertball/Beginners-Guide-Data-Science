Ingredients:
Cooked cubed chicken
Celery (sliced then diced)
Pineapple
Diced Red Onion
3 or so shakes of Poultry Seasoning
Salt & Pepper
Mayonnaise
Pecan Pieces
1 tsp mustard

Directions:
Add all the ingredients. If you want it a little sweeter, just add a little of the pineapple juice, just be sure not to make it too runny (watery). If you do use the juice, just use less mayonnaise.

Robin McCaughey Garrett
Description: 
Just remember to taste it along the way. I have used both pineapple chunks and rings. I just dice them up smaller. The poultry seasoning is in the pantry.
