Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups fiddlehead ferns
3 slices bacon
1 English cucumber, seeded and minced
Sun-Dried Tomato Dressing:
1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
3/4 cup vegetable oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the fusilli at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into drained pasta; stir to coat.
Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the fiddlehead ferns at a boil until tender, 3 to 5 minutes; drain. Rinse the fiddleheads in cold water to stop from further cooking; drain.
Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon once cool enough to handle.
Toss the pasta, fiddlehead ferns, crumbled bacon, and cucumber together in a large bowl.
Combine sun-dried tomatoes, egg yolk, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and garlic in a bowl. Stream about 1/3 of the vegetable oil into the mixture while whisking vigorously until the mixture begins to emulsify. Stream the remainder of the olive oil into the dressing while whisking; season with salt and pepper.
Pour the dressing onto the pasta mixture; stir to coat.

Description: 
A great way to use fiddlehead ferns. A very tasty late-spring salad. If you can't get fiddleheads you can always use green beans. This salad is great for a BBQ, picnic, or potluck!
