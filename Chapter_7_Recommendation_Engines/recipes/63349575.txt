Altar or Communion Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
4 c. whole wheat flour plus additional flour to knead in as necessary (I use King Arthur)
4 t. baking powder
2 t. salt
1/2 c. milk
1/2 c. oil
1/2 c. water
2/3 c. honey

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Mix liquid ingredients together in a smaller bowl.
Pour liquids into a well in the dry ingredients, and mix together thoroughly. The dough should be stiff and moist but not sticky.
Turn out onto a lightly-floured board and knead breifly, using an additional 1/2 cup flour or so.
Roll out 3/8 inch thick.
Cut into rounds of desired size (probably no larger than 6 1/2 inches in diameter). Tupperware can be used as a cookie cutter.
Place rounds on a heavy, light-colored, oiled (or use vegetable spray) cookie sheet. Score a cross on each loaf using a long, sharp, thin knife dipped in cool water. Rock knife gently while scoring.
Bake 10 to 12 minutes at 375 degrees F. (Watch carefully!) Bottoms should be very light brown.
Cool on wire rack and when cool, wrap well. Bread will keep in refrigerator up to two weeks (longer in freezer). Let come to room temperature before use. Yield will vary according to size of rounds; makes about 6 six-inch and 6 three-inch loaves. A six inch round serves about 15-20 people.

Description: 
This is the recipe baked at the Monastery of  the Society of St. John the Evangelist in Cambridge, MA. I like it because it holds together well and therefore is relatively crumb-free.
