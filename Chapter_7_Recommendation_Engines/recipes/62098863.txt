Ingredients:
5-6 lbs Standing Pork Rib Roast(you can ask the butcher to cut it off the bone and restring it, if you prefer no bone)
3/4 c. Garlic salt
4 T curry powder
3 T black pepper
1 can chicken stock

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
Place roast fat side up on a baking rack in sink.
In mixing bowl combine garlic salt, curry powder,black pepper.
Add chicken stock gradually.
Stop adding stock when this mixture forms a thick paste.
Coat fat side and ends of roast with paste using a wooden spoon to help it adhere.
Place roast on roasting rack and "seal" in the hot oven for 20 minutes.DO NOT OPEN DOOR DURING THIS PROCESS.
After 20 minutes turn the oven down to 300 degrees
It is best to cook this roast until done on meat thermometer, but with a 6 lb roast it usually takes four hours or so.
Using an elextric knife cut the roast at least 3/4 inch thick.

Description: 
This is a very easy beautiful roast. It is a standing Pork Rib Roast, which I serve cut thick like Prime Rib Roast. It is beautiful at Christmas dinner with my baked apples filled with Spicy Cranberry Cornbread Stuffing!
