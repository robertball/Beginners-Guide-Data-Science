Ingredients:
2-3 large red potatoes, diced (about 1 inch or 1/2 sizes)
1 pkg. ranch dress mix
3/4 c. sour cream
1 can cream of chicken soup

Directions:
Spray crock pot with cooking spray, this will help a lot. Combine all ingredients except potatoes in a large bowl and stir well. Add potatoes and stir til the potatoes are completely coated. Pour in crock pot, cook on low for 4-5 hours or til potatoes are tender. Stir occasionally as cream and potatoes start to stick to the sides. You may need to add a little salt and pepper but taste first before you add any.
