Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 dash hot sauce (optional)
2 cups panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dried thyme, or more to taste
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips
canola oil for frying

Directions:
Beat eggs lightly in a bowl; add hot sauce. Place panko and flour in 2 separate bowls.
Mix salt, paprika, pepper, thyme, dried basil, and garlic powder into panko.
Coat chicken strips in flour. Dip into beaten eggs, and then into panko.
Heat about 2 inches of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chicken strips in batches, until golden brown and until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
Light and crispy chicken strips or nuggets that are juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Kids love them and they are really customizable to your liking. I use whole wheat flour and canola oil for a healthier twist.
