Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts halves
1/4 cup of light garlic cream cheese
1/4 cup Frank's Red Hot sauce
2 tbsp white vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 Spanish onion cut into half rings
1 tsp of garlic powder
1/2 jalapeño cut into rings
4 slices of focaccia bread
salt & pepper to taste
2 tbsp light garlic cream cheese
2 oz of slices sharp cheddar
2 tbsp of blue cheese dressing

Directions:
In a large skillet, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and set to medium heat.
In a small skillet set heat to medium-low, add oil and the onions and cook until they caramelize and soften.
Add the chicken to the large skillet and cook until the juices run clear. Turn the heat off and shred the chicken.
Add the the Frank's Red Hot sauce, vinegar and the 1/4 cup of cream cheese and mix until creamy.
Spread a tbsp of garlic cream cheese on one slice of each pair of bread slices. Lay out the cheddar over top the cream cheese.
Spoon heaping spoonfuls of the buffalo chicken over the bread slice with cheese and until the bread is well covered. Now drizzle the blue cheese and top with onions and jalapeños.
Close the sandwich and stick in a pre-heated panini grill for 2 minutes until the cheese has melted.
