Frozen Orange Grand Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1/4 cup boiling water
1 1/3 cups orange juice
6 egg yolks
2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup orange liqueur (such as Grand MarnierÂ®)
2 cups heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Mix gelatin and cold water in a bowl until softened; stir in boiling water until gelatin is dissolved.
Beat orange juice and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until combined. Beat sugar and orange liqueur into the orange juice mixture; add gelatin mixture and stir until smooth.
Beat cream in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Carefully fold whipped cream into orange juice-gelatin mixture until just combined; pour into a glass trifle dish. Freeze until set, 8 hours to overnight. Thaw before serving.
