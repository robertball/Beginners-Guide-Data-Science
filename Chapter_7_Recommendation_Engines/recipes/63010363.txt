Ingredients:
1 box of Healthy Harvest Whole Grain Lasagna
2 jars of Prego (onion, tomato, and garlic) chunky
1 container of Ricotta cheese
3 eggs
1 bag of mozzarella cheese (shredded)
1 package of Turkey Italian Sausage (Jennie O)
1 package of turkey pepperoni (Hormel)
Italian Seasoning
Crushed Red Pepper
Parmesan Cheese
Olive oil

Directions:
Brown the meat in a skillet with a spoonful of olive oil.  Meat does not have to be thoroughly cooked, as it will be baked in the lasagna.  Season the meat with Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese.
In a bowl mix ricotta, 3 eggs and Parmesan cheese until smooth.
Noodles do not have to be boiled.  If boiling, do it according to package.
Using a deep pan, evenly spread a layer of spaghetti sauce.  A layer of pepperoni (optional) a layer of noodles (depending on size of pan, noodles may overlap) a layer of ricotta cheese mixture and you can just continue to repeat these steps making it as many layers as you'd like.  Top layer can be noodles, sauce and mozzarella cheese or sauce and mozzarella cheese.

Description: 
I LOVE lasagna!  I've tried making it as often as I can and I usually always make it differently.  My friend, a chef, gave me quick tips years ago and every since I've tried to make it easier for me to make.
