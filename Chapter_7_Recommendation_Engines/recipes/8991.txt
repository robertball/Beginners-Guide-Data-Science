Ingredients:
½ cup light mayonnaise
1 teaspoon minced garlic
½ teaspoon curry powder
½ teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon ground ginger
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups water
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
1  tomato, diced
3  green onions, chopped
skewers

Directions:
In a large, shallow dish, mix the mayonnaise, garlic, curry powder, chili powder, and ginger. Place the chicken in the mixture, and stir to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.
Preheat the grill for medium-high heat.
Discard marinade, and thread chicken pieces and mushrooms onto skewers. In a saucepan, bring the rice and water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill skewers, turning often, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear.
In a small bowl, toss together the tomato and onions. Serve the grilled chicken and mushrooms over rice. Top with the onions and tomatoes.

Description: 
These are light on curry but flavorful, and a nice change of pace when you're tired of the same old cookout fare.
