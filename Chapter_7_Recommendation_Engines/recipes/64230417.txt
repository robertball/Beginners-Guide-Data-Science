Ingredients:
2 packages Corn Bread Stuffing Mix
1 pound Pork Sausage
1/2 Onion, Chopped
1 Celery Stalk, Chopped
2 tbsp Melted Butter
Salt
Pepper
1 cup Dried Cranberries
1 cup Orange Juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Chop up the onion and the celery. In a large mixing bowl, pour the packets of stuffing in the bowl. In a smaller bowl, mix the orange juice and butter together. Set both bowls aside for now.
In a large nonstick skillet, cook sausage until brown. Add in the chopped onion and celery and continue to cook, stirring occasionally.
Back to the large bowl. Stir in the sausage mixture and mix until well combined. Add in the cranberries, salt, and pepper and mix until well combined. Pour the orange juice and butter mixture in the small bowl into the large bowl and mix until well combined.
Pour stuffing into a greased baking pan and bake for 30-35 minutes until lightly browned.
