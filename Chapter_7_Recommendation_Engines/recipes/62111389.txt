Ingredients:
4 oz. whole-wheat angel hair pasta
1 medium tomato, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed or finely diced
1/2 bunch asparagus
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 lemon
Water
Teaspoon of salt for water
salt and pepper to taste
freshly grated parmesan (optional)

Directions:
Fill a medium pot with water and put it on high heat until boiling, then add the teaspoon of salt.
While waiting for the water, hold each asparagus stalk by both ends and bend until it breaks. Discard the bottom parts and slice the remainder into 1 inch long pieces.
Put the angel hair and the asparagus pieces into the boiling water together and cook until the angel hair is fully cooked but still chewy - about 3-4 minutes. Strain.
In a skillet on medium heat, warm the olive oil and add the garlic. Sautee until the garlic is golden.
Add the tomato cubes to the skillet with a bit of salt and pepper and cook while stirring for about 1 minute, until the tomato juices mix with the garlic and oil.
Add the pasta and asparagus to the skillet. Squeeze the lemon over the pasta and stir well so that the vegetables are equally spread throughout the pasta.
Remove from heat and plate. Sprinkle grated parmesan over the dish if desired.
