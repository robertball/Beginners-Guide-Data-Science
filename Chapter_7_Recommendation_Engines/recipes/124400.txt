Ingredients:
2 medium green bell peppers
1/2 pound ground beef
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided

3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Cut tops off peppers and discard; remove seeds. Blanch peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water; set aside. In a bowl, combine beef, 1/4 cup of tomato sauce, rice, 2 tablespoons of cheese, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and egg; mix well. Stuff the peppers; place in an ungreased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over peppers. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45-60 minutes or until meat is no longer pink and peppers are tender. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; return to the oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
MY HUSBAND likes stuffed peppers, but my old recipe made too much. I devised this recipe to accommodate just the two of us. It helps to use a small-size casserole so the peppers won't tip over while baking.    For color, I serve steamed carrots with the peppers, rounding out the meal perfectly.                                               --Elaine Carpenter                                                            Horseshoe Bay, Texas
