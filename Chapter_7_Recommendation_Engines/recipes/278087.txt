Ingredients:
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 egg
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
3/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper (optional)
4 ounces fresh lump crabmeat
3 tablespoons remoulade sauce, or to taste (optional)
3 brioche slider buns (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Mix bread crumbs, mayonnaise, egg, Worcestershire, mustard, Cajun seasoning, salt, cayenne, and pepper together in a small mixing bowl. Fold in crabmeat gently.
Form into 3 equal-size crab cakes using a biscuit cutter. Place cakes on a parchment round and transfer to the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until browned, about 6 minutes more. Serve with remoulade sauce on slider buns.
