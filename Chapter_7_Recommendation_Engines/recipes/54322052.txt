Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package light cream cheese
1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained and flaked
1 green onions with tops, thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce
48 wonton wrappers

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly spray baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine cream cheese, crab, green onions, Soy sauce in a bowl. To prevent wonton skins from drying, prepare only 1 or 2 rangoon at a time. Place 1 teaspoon of filling onto the center of each wonton skin. Moisten the edges with water and fold the wonton skin diagonally to form a triangle, pressing edges to seal. Moisten one of the bottom corners. Create a crown by pulling both bottom corners together and sealing. Arrange the rangoon on the baking sheet and lightly spray with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
