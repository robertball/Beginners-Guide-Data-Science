Ingredients:
Â¼ cup butter, softened
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1  lemon, zested and halved
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1  whole chicken
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix butter, garlic, thyme, rosemary, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together in a bowl.
Loosen skin on chicken breast; rub butter mixture between skin and breast meat. Press on the skin to distribute evenly. Rub oil, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper all over; place lemon halves inside cavity. Set in a baking pan.
Roast in the preheated oven, basting after 30 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let rest before carving, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is the best chicken I have ever made. My husband liked this so much that, because I had leftover potatoes, gravy, and cornbread stuffing, I had to make another chicken.
