Ingredients:
1-3/4 c. all purpose flour
pinch of salt
1-1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 stick of butter
2 cups of cooking apples (Braeburn or Royal Gala are good), peeled, cored and finely chopped.
Nutmeg
Cinnamon
Cloves
1/2 c. sugar
1/4 c. raisins or currants (soaked in rum if you like)
1 egg, beaten
a bit of milk

Directions:
Sprinkle chopped apples with a bit nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves (all to taste).
Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl.  Rub in the butter.  Stir in the apples, sugar and raisins (or currants).  Mix to a firm dough with the beaten egg (and a bit of milk if too firm).  Turn into a greased and floured 8 inch loaf tin.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 45 to 60 minutes, until golden on top.  Serve warm with clotted cream.
