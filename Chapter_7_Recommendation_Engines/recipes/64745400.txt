Ingredients:
9 ounces purple carrots
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tsp lemon zest
1 and 1/3 cup flour
1.5 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 cup light vegetable oil
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs
1 tsp purple food coloring, optional

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 175°C. Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Set aside.
Finely grate the carrots into a large bowl. Add the brown and white sugars and the lemon zest. Toss to coat to allow the natural juices to come out. Set aside.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla. Add the flour mixture little-by-little. Mix until just combined. Fold in the carrot-sugar mixture with all the juice that has accumulated. Add the food coloring, if using.
Pour into the baking dish. Bake until cooked throughout, approximately 45 minutes.
Allow to cool before serving.
Note: If you want to frost the cake. Cool completely and add a bit of purple food coloring to your favorite cream cheese frosting.

Description: 
Carrot cake gets a makeover with purple carrots. This cake is light and moist, not too sweet, and has a rich purple color. Purple carrots taste exactly like their orange cousins but give such a beautiful presentation they’re nice for a change.
