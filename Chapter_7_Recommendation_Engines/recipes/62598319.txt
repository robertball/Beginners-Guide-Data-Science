Ingredients:
750 g  Mixta (Mixture of minced pork and beef) or Just Beef Mince (The mixture adds a richness to the flavour)
1 clove Garlic  finely chopped
1 Spring Onion (Scallion)  finely chopped
4 Tbsp Fresh Basil  Finely chopped
2 Tbsp Fresh Parsley  Finely chopped
Big Splash Worcestershire Sauce - to taste
1 Egg  lightly beaten
40 g Butter
Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper

Directions:
Apart Butter, mix all ingredients together and form into hamburger shapes.
Melt butter in frying pan and cook hamburgers on medium heat. When browned on one side turn over and cook steadily until ready.
Serve on rolls with fries, tomato sauce and side salad or anything you like – Tomatoes, Sauces/Ketchups etc
If want more healthy can grill or barbeque without using butter but in frying pan it feels devilish. Cheers
