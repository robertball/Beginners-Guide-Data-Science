Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, trimmed
1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/3 cup walnuts, chopped
2/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/2 cup low-fat mayonnaise
1 tablespoon dried tarragon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 1/2 cups diced celery
1 1/2 cups halved red seedless grapes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Arrange chicken in a glass baking dish large enough to hold it in a single layer. Pour broth around the chicken. Bake the chicken until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast registers 170°F, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board until cool enough to handle, then cut into cubes. (Discard broth or save for another use.)
Meanwhile, spread walnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly golden and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Let cool.
Stir sour cream, mayonnaise, tarragon, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add celery, grapes, the chicken and walnuts; stir to coat. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
