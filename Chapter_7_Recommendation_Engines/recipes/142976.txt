Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs
Salt and pepper to taste
1 (10 fluid ounce) bottle oyster sauce
2 teaspoons minced garlic
3/4 cup SPLENDAÂ® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place chicken thighs in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Season with salt and pepper to taste and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the oyster sauce, garlic, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and water. Mix together and taste the sauce; if it is not sweet enough, add more sweetener to taste.
After chicken has baked for 25 minutes, pour sauce over it and bake for another 20 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
