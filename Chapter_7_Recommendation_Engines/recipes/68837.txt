Ingredients:
3 gallons water, divided
2 1/2 pounds beef tripe, cut into 1-inch pieces
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 large white onion, finely chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons ground red pepper
5 de arbol chile peppers
6 japones chile peppers, seeds removed
6 cups canned white or yellow hominy, drained
1/2 white onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 limes, juiced

Directions:
In a large pot, bring 1 gallon water to a boil. Place tripe in the pot, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours. Periodically skim off fat with a spoon. Drain water, reduce heat, and pour in a fresh gallon of water. Continue to simmer tripe for 2 hours; drain.
Pour remaining 1 gallon water into the pot with tripe, and bring to a boil. Stir in garlic and 1 white onion. Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour.
Preheat the broiler.
Arrange the de arbol chile peppers on a baking sheet, and broil about 2 minutes, just until they begin to scorch. Remove from heat, slit lengthwise, and remove seeds. In a blender or food processor, blend the de arbol chile peppers and japones chile peppers until very finely chopped. Mix into the pot, and continue cooking 2 hours over low heat.
Mix the hominy into the pot. Continue cooking 1 hour. Serve with remaining onion, cilantro, and lime juice.

Description: 
Inexpensive to make, and fully authentic, this menudo will have your Latin lovers swooning! This recipe uses a combination of chiles to deliver its trademark red color, and packs a mildly spicy punch. And it is really quite easy to make - my husband absolutely devoured it the first time I made it.
