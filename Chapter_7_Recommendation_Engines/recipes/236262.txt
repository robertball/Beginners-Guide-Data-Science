Ingredients:
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or as needed
2 pounds baby carrots
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup coconut flour
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, at room temperature

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish with 1 teaspoon coconut oil or cooking spray.
Place carrots into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until very tender, about 45 minutes. Drain and transfer carrots to a food processor. Add 1/2 cup coconut oil, coconut flour, lemon juice, vanilla extract, honey, nutmeg, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt to food processor; blend until smooth.
Blend eggs, adding 1 at a time and processing after each addition, into carrot mixture. Spoon carrot mixture into the prepared casserole dish, allowing room to rise.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes.
