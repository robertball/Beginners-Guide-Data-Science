Ingredients:
9 eggs
3/4 cup half & half (heavy whipping cream works too)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp pepper (to taste)
2 Tbsp flour (not necessary)
1 Tbsp bacon grease (or butter)
1 red bell pepper
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 cup ham steak (cut into little cubes)
3/4 cup shredded cheese (can use more/less to preference)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 F
Chop bell pepper
Melt butter/bacon grease in pan
Lightly cook bell pepper so soft/not raw & set aside
Chop spinach, set aside
Chop green onion, set aside
Chop Ham, set aside
In a large bowl, mix eggs, half & half, salt, nutmeg, pepper, and flour if you choose. A hand mixer makes them fluffier... I think lol
Spray muffin tin generously- the egg will stick
Fill tin no more than 1/2 way full with egg mixture - should make at least 15 (I used a 1/4 measuring cup to spoon in rather than try pouring)
Put a generous pinch of spinach in each cup until it’s divided up evenly. Then a small pinch of the green onions, and some of the bell peppers, a decent amount of ham (which should weigh down the veggies), and finally top with a little shredded cheese.
Use spoon to push the cheese/toppings down into the egg - the tin should be no more than 3/4 of the way full
Bake in oven for 25 minutes. They will puff up, but fall back down after you take them out (although I’m not sure if that’s true if you use the flour!)
Remove from tins to cool a bit and enjoy!
Note they can be freezed and microwaved for a quick morning  meal

Description: 
These freezable crustless quiche are like their mini counterparts, but those are too small for a normal person so I like to make them in a normal muffin tin!  They’re kind of like a portable omelette.! Also, they go fast so I recommend doubling (or tripling!) so you can actually freeze some for later.
