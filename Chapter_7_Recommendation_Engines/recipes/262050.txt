Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups arepas flour (such as P.A.N.Â®)
1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 tablespoon honey
vegetable oil
1 (6 ounce) package cooked chicken, shredded, or to taste
1/2 (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, sliced, or to taste
1/2 avocado, sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Bring milk to a simmer in a pot. Remove from heat and stir in butter.
Combine arepas flour, grated Monterey Jack cheese, kosher salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the hot milk mixture and honey; stir until combined. Let mixture sit until milk is absorbed enough for a soft dough to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Dough will continue to stiffen.
Form dough into 12 balls about 2 inches in diameter. Flatten between palms into 3 1/2- to 4-inch arepa patties about 1/3-inch thick.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry 3 to 4 arepas at a time until lightly golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Slice each arepa in half crosswise and stuff a portion of chicken, sliced Monterey Jack cheese, and avocado between the halves.
