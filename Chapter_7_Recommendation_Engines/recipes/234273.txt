Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup margarine
1 (6 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix
8 slices deli turkey breast
1 (12 ounce) jar turkey gravy

Directions:
Bring water and margarine to a boil in a saucepan; stir in stuffing mix. Cover and remove from heat. Let stand until stuffing is softened, about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
Spoon about 1/2 cup stuffing over each slice of turkey. Roll turkey around stuffing and arrange rolls in a microwave-safe dish, seam-side down. Pour gravy over rolls.
Heat in a microwave on high until gravy is bubbly, about 5 minutes.
