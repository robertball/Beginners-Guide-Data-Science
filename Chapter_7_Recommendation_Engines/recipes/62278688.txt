Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 chicken breasts, halved into 4 ounce pieces and pounded to 1/4-inch thickness
4 tablespoons flour
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (you can use traditional paprika if you don't have the smoked)
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup vermouth or dry white wine
1/2 cup chicken broth (I use my own and it really makes a flavor difference)
1/4 cup capers, drained
1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, without oil, drained and halved

Directions:
Put flour, lemon zest and smoked paprika in a sealable plastic bag. Add chicken breast pieces, seal and shake to coat.
Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chicken, shaking off excess flour mixture, and saute, about 2 minutes per side, until golden brown on both sides.
Add juice, vermouth and broth. Simmer for about 5 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and sauce thickens. Add artichokes and capers and simmer for an additional minute. Plate the chicken and top with a little sauce, including some capers and artichokes.

Description: 
A good bite of lemon, paired with the piquant of the capers. I served the chicken on a bed of sauteed spinach and garlic with a mushroom-pea risotto. The lemon sauce was wonderful with the spinach. You won't be able to tell my lightened up version from those higher in fat and calories. The piccata has 246 calories with 3 grams of fat and 9 grams of fiber.
