Description: 
This recipe is one my father taught me. It is the simplest homemade marinade! Just 5 common ingredients! When used overnight, the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic make flank, skirt and sirloin steaks flavorful and, most importantly, tender for the grill! For more flavor, add Kosher salt and cracked black pepper to your steak while it cooks. Red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar may be substituted for the red wine.
