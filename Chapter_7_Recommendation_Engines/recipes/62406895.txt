Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil
1/2 yellow onion, minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch fresh spinach, trimmed of stems
2 cups Greek yogurt
2 cups sour cream
1/2 cup finely crumbled feta cheese
1/3 cup chopped dill
2 tbsp onion powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Wash the spinach and cut off the stems. Cut the leaves into 1/2 inch ribbons. Mince the onion and garlic.
Over medium high heat, heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan. When oil is hot, add the onion and garlic at once. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft.
Add the chopped spinach and stir until wilted (about 1 minute).
Remove pan from heat. Strain excess liquid from the mixture using a strainer or by pressing it against one side of the pan and pouring the liquid out. Allow the mixture to cool completely.
In a medium mixing bowl, blend the yogurt, sour cream, and crumbled feta cheese until completely combined.
After the spinach mixture is completely cool, stir it into the yogurt mixture.
Add chopped dill, onion powder, oregano and mix well. Add lemon juice, if desired.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Refrigerate the dip or use immediately. Serve with toasted baguette slices or crackers. Enjoy!
