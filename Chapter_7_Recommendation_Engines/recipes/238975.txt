Ingredients:
Fruit:
2 cups fresh blackberries
1 cup white sugar
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Cobbler Batter:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, cut into small chunks
1/2 cup milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil an 8-inch square or 8-inch round baking dish.
Combine blackberries and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan. Whisk warm water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; stir into blackberries. Bring blackberry mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until berries break down and thicken, 5 to 10 minutes.
Whisk flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry cutter or your hands until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into flour-butter mixture until a smooth, thick batter forms.
Pour berry mixture into the prepared baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of batter over the berries.
Bake in the preheated oven until a firm and golden crust forms, 30 to 40 minutes.

I've never found a whole wheat cobbler that I truly enjoy, so I set out to make my own. The results were better than I expected.
