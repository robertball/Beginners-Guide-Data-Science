Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1/2 large orange bell pepper, diced
1/2 yellow onion
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons ancho chile powder
1 cube vegetable bouillon (such as The Organic Gourmetâ„¢)

Directions:
Combine stewed tomatoes, water, brown rice, orange bell pepper, onion, oil, ancho chile powder, and vegetable bouillon in a saucepan over low heat. Cover and stir occasionally. Simmer until rice is cooked and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Thanks to a strong vegetable bouillon cube infusion, this recipe makes the house smell almost like it has chicken in it, but is, of course, vegetarian.

 Meat eaters think I have fallen off the wagon when they smell this and start looking for the chicken bouillon box. If the dish is too runny at 45 minutes, uncover and continue to simmer.
