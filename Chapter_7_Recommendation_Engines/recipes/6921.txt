Ingredients:
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups mashed bananas
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
2 1/3 cups baking mix
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Generously grease the bottom of a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.
Measure oil, bananas, vanilla, eggs, baking mix, sugar, and nuts into a large bowl.  Beat vigorously with a spoon for about 30 seconds.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 to 65 minutes.  Cool for 5 minutes in the pan.  Loosen sides of loaf from the pan.  Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
