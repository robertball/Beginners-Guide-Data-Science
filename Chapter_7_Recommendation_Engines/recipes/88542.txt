Ingredients:
1 cup dry macaroni
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 (11 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, drained
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese, cubed

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
