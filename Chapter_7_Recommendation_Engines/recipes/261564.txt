Ingredients:
2 small eggplants, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
6 cloves garlic, crushed and peeled
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spread eggplants and garlic cloves on a rimmed baking sheet. Brush with 1/2 cup olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until soft, about 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil while eggplants and garlic are roasting. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Place eggplants and garlic in a food processor; process into a smooth paste. Stir paste into the onions in the skillet. Stir in tomatoes. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Toss hot penne and basil into the sauce and mix together.

Description: 
If you like eggplant, you should try this! The sauce for this pasta is made by roasting eggplant and garlic in the oven, then making a paste from it after it's soft. Make sure you find the perfect eggplant, otherwise it could leave you with a bitter recipe. It turned out great for me!
