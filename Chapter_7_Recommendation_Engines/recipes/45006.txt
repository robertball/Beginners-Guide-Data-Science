Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup oat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the confectioners' sugar and butter until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the all-purpose flour, oat flour, and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Cover the dough, and chill for about 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 7 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges begin to brown. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. When cool, eat plain, or frost with your favorite cookie frosting.
