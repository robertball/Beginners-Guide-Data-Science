Ingredients:
Veggie Burgers:
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1 carrot
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
6 small green onions, chopped
1/4 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
1/4 cup peas
1/4 cup corn kernels
2 tablespoons olive oil
Tahini Sauce:
1/2 cup plain yogurt
3 tablespoons tahini
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 teaspoon hot Madras curry powder

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Process carrot in food processor until roughly chopped; add quinoa, garbanzo beans, green onions, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, and cumin. Pulse quinoa mixture until just mixed; transfer to a bowl.
Stir peas and corn into the quinoa mixture; refrigerate until mixture comes together, about 15 minutes. Form quinoa mixture into patties.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry patties until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Stir yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, cilantro, and curry powder together in a bowl. Serve burgers with tahini sauce.
