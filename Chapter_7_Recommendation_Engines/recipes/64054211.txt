Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs with skin, 6 cloves garlic chopped, flour to coat chicken, garlic salt and pepper to taste, 1 large onion chopped, 2 cups white rice uncooked, enough olive oil to fry chicken, and 4 cups chicken broth or chicken bouillon mixed with 4 cups of water.

Directions:
Salt and pepper chicken and coat with flour. Cook chicken pieces in olive oil until browned and almost done, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from pan. In about 2 Tbsp of drippings, brown the rice, garlic and onion (we love garlic and onion in our family, so the more, the better!) When rice is browned and onion tender, add chicken pieces and broth or bouillon mixture. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes or until chicken is completely done and rice has cooked and thickened into sauce. Enjoy.

Description: 
This is my absolute favorite chicken dish, taught to me by my grandmother when I wasn't more than a young girl. Is absolutely delicious if your a hard core garlic and onion lover like me and my family.
