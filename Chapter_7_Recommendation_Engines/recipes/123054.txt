Description: 
'This crisp, fresh-tasting slaw keeps in the fridge for several days,' notes Deborah Moore-Dedenbach from Big Bay, Michigan. It's a bargain, too, at 13 cents a serving. 'We live about an hour from the nearest major city, so shopping trips can be few and far between. I often buy cabbage rather than lettuce for salads, because it stores longer,' Deborah says.
