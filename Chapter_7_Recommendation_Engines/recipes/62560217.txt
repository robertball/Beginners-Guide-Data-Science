Ingredients:
Enough cooked carrots to make a presentable side dish.
Salt and pepper, to taste.
Any light colored Jam, Jelly, Preserve, Conserve or Marmalade.

Directions:
Peel and slice carrots or use baby carrots, using enough to accompolish your side dish.
Put carrots into a pan and cover with water and cook until carrots are fork tender.
Drain carrots and then return carrots to pan and place pan on burner.
Add enough Jam, Jelly, Preserves, Conserve, or Marmalade.
Stir gently, don't use a metal spoon, it will cut up the carrots, and blend with carrots making sure all carrots are coated.
Return to heat and heat thoroughly.
Season with salt and pepper if you want, but I don't. I like the fresh carrot flavor.
