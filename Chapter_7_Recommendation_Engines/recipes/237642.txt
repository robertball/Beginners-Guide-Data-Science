Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup quinoa
2 tablespoons pesto
1 roma tomatoes, diced
2 ounces crumbled feta cheese
4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled (optional)

Directions:
Bring broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a bowl and fluff with a fork.
Stir pesto, tomatoes, feta cheese, and bacon into the quinoa.

Description: 
I love pesto, and quinoa is so good for you. So why not mix them and all the amazingness! Bacon is not necessary; chicken would work, or you could go with no meat at all. Serve hot or cold.
