Ingredients:
6 skinless, bone-in chicken breast halves
2 skinless chicken drumsticks
4 skinless chicken thighs
2 tablespoons browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®)
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt to taste
2 teaspoons paprika, or to taste
8 yellow onions, thinly sliced and separated into rings

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Place chicken breast halves, drumsticks, and thighs in a large bowl (see Cook's Note). Add browning sauce and olive oil, tossing to coat. Season with salt and paprika to taste.
Arrange chicken pieces in one layer on the bottom of a roasting pan. Top with sliced onions. Cover and bake for 5 hours, basting with pan juices every hour. The onions will release some liquid; if mixture looks dried out, add a small amount of water.
Transfer chicken and onions to a platter and serve with extra pan juices as gravy.

Description: 
'Gedempte' is Yiddish for 'well-cooked.' This is a baked onion chicken recipe from my great grandmother. It basically falls off the bone. The onions become very brown and tender during cooking.
