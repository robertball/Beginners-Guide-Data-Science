Ingredients:
12 tbsp. unsalted butter
1 package confectioners' sugar
0.50 c. heavy cream
1 tbsp. pure vanilla extract
pinch of salt

Directions:
In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until nut-brown in color, about 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour butter into a bowl, leaving any burned sediment behind; let cool.
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add confectioners' sugar, vanilla, salt, and butter. With the mixer on low, slowly add cream; beat until smooth. If frosting seems too thick, stir another tablespoon cream into the mixture.
