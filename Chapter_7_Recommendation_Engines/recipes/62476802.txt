Ingredients:
1 cup Vegan chocolate chips (melted)
3/4 cup organic raisins
1 tbsp. organic vanilla extract
2 tbsp. Organic Chia seeds
1 lemon (juice only)
1/2 - 1 cup raw walnuts (chopped)

Directions:
Melt chocolate chips in a saucepan on low.  In small food processor or blender mix raisins, vanilla, chia seeds and lemon juice.  Process until smooth. Pour in melted chocolate and mix well.  Stir in walnuts and pour into small (very small 6" x 7" container). I used a small glass pyrex dish and used 3/4 of the dish by smoothing it to the size I liked. Also, smooth top of fudge so it looks perfect.  Place in freezer and watch carefully for fudge to firm up, but not get too firm.  Slice into squares, put in container and place back in freezer. ENJOY!
