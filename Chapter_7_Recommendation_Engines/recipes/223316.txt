Description: 
I adapted a potato muffin recipe to create these savory muffins that helped use up my overflowing stock of vegetables from my garden! You could add any kind of fresh herb if you like, but they are very flavorful on their own. Serve a couple as a main dish with a side salad, or use as a veggie side to a meat dish. Yummy!
