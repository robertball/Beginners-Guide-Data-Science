Ingredients:
2 cups(240g)whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking soda
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 cup(60g) brown sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce (or oil)
1 cup milk
1 T. vanilla

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Next add brown sugar and mix well, breaking up the brown sugar into pea sized pieces. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the applesauce, milk and vanilla. Mix thoroughly. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the milk, egg mixture; mix until just combined. Do not overmix. Adjust your batter at this point to your liking- more milk, looser batter.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium to medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/8 - 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.

Description: 
This is my version of a great recipe that I found in my Mom's recipe book. It actually came from my grandmother Momo around WW2. My only real change was substituting applesauce for the oil. Feel free to try either way.Modified from: Good Old Fashioned Pancakes
