Ingredients:
1 1/4 Cup Flour
1/2 teaspoon Baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 Cup Butter, softened
2/3 Cup Packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon Vanilla
1 Egg
1 Cup Quick cooking rolled oats
1 Cup Shredded zucchini
1/2 Cup Raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350º.
In a medium bowl whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon and ground gloves; and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl beat butter and brown sugar until creamy.  Add the egg and vanilla beat very well.
Add flour and oats to batter, mix well.
Wring zucchini in a clean towel to remove the excess moisture and add the zucchini and raisins to the batter and mix well.
Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls 2” apart onto a greased cookie sheet.
Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the bottom edges turn golden brown.

Description: 
In my efforts to use the abundance of zucchini in my garden I concocted this little cookie.  I prefer my oatmeal cookies to have a little jazz, so if you are not a fan of ground cloves they can be omitted.  It's a not too sweet cake-like cookie that is perfect with your cup of coffee or tea.
