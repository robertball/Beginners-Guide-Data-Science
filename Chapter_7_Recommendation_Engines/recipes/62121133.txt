Ingredients:
1 pint of applesauce
1 large can of sliced peaches
1 large can of sliced pears
1 large can of pineapple chunks
1 large can of mandarin oranges
1 large can of fruit cocktail (or tropical fruit cocktail)
1 large can of cherry pie filling
1/3 cup of brown sugar
1 tsp of cinnamon
1/2 cup of walnut halves (NOT chopped walnuts)

Directions:
2-3 hours before serving, layer in a crock pot and heat:
applesauce
peaches (drained)
pears (drained)
pineapple (drained)
fruit cocktail (drained)
cherry pie filling
Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on top of the fruit mixture
Sprinkle with the Walnut halves.
(I have made this in a casserole dish also, if you're serving it right away. If serving at a pot luck it's nice to have it in a crock pot.)
