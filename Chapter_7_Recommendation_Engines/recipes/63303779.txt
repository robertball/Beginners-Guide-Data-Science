Ingredients:
1 loaf french bread, sliced and lightly toasted
3 oz. Prosciutto
1 lb. Mozzarella slices
1 pt. Cherry tomatoes
2 lg. Portabello mushrooms, sliced
fresh basil leaves
butter
garlic infused olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut one pint of cherry or grape tomatoes in half.  Place in skillet with 1 1/2 tbs. of butter and 1 1/2 tbs. of garlic infused olive oil.  Saute for 20-30 minutes.  Press on the tomatoes with a spatula during cooking to help reduce them.  Once cooked, they should resemble jelly.  If needed, drain excess juice.
Slice two large portabello mushrooms, saute in olive oil, or garlic infused olive oil until tender, about 10 min.
Butter and lightly toast one side of bread slices.
Place toasted side of bread up, on baking sheet.  Place a couple of portabello slices and a slice of mozzarella on crostini, spread on tomato garlic jelly.
Place prosciutto on top.  Place baking sheet in 400Â° oven just long enough for cheese to start melting.
Remove from oven and sprinkle with chopped fresh basil.
