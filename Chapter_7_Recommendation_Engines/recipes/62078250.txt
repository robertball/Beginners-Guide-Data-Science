Image:

Ingredients:
1 (18.25 oz) box yellow or butter cake mix
1 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 (15 oz) can sweet potatoes, drained and mashed
1/3 cup canola oil
3 eggs
1 cup water
GLAZE:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 Tb butter or margarine
2 Tb milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease or spray a 9x13" pan (or a Bundt pan).
In bowl of electric mixer, combine cake mix, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Add the mashed sweet potatoes, oil, eggs and water, and beat until smooth and no lumps.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.  Bake about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean (Bundt pan takes a little longer, maybe 40-45 mins).  FOR GLAZE:  Melt the butter and combine with the milk and powdered sugar - whisk until smooth and no lumps.  While still warm, poke holes in cake and spread glaze over the top.
NOTE:  I doubled the cake and glaze recipes for a 12x18 inch sheet cake pan (baked cake 30-35 mins).

Description: 
Came up with this quick and easy mix version of sweet potato cake one day when I didn't have time to make my favorite from-scratch recipe.  The glaze goes very well with it, although a creamcheese frosting would go well, too.  Got many compliments and requests for the recipe.  A good one for the holidays!
