Ingredients:
16 ounces lean ground beef
4 ounces ground pork
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 egg
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine beef, pork, Italian seasoning, salt, garlic, egg, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs in a large bowl. Mix well until evenly combined. Form into 16 equally-sized meatballs using an ice cream scoop and place on a baking sheet.
Place 1/2 of the meatballs in the basket of the air fryer and cook 8 minutes. Shake the basket and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer to a serving plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining meatballs.

Description: 
After cooking meatballs in the air fryer, I will never bake them in the oven again. The insides stay nice and tender while the outsides get a slight crisp on them. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and freeze for later use. I have included those directions in the notes. Dip meatballs in marinara, if desired.
