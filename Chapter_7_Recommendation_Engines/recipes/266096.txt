8 cups water, divided
1 cup sweet rice
1 (15 ounce) can coconut milk

Combine 6 cups water and rice in a large bowl and soak 8 hours to overnight.
Drain rice and rinse with fresh water. Combine 2 cups water and rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer cooked rice to a bowl.
