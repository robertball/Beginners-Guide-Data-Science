Ingredients:
1 10-inch pie crust, unbaked
1 cup white sugar
1 cup milk
3/4 cup shredded coconut
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 large eggs, separated
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 lemon, zested
1 1/2 cups whipped cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate.
Mix sugar, milk, coconut, butter, lemon juice, egg yolks, flour, and lemon zest together in a bowl. Beat egg whites in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold lemon mixture into egg whites; pour into pie crust. Loosely cover the crust with aluminum foil to prevent browning.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes more. Cool pie to room temperature, at least 30 minutes; top with whipped cream.

Description: 
A surprise in the first slice, with layers of custard, cake, and whipped cream. My husband has coconut allergies, so if I make it for him I leave the coconut out.
