Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 cup margarine, melted
3/4 cup white sugar
3 egg, beaten
4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
7 1/2 cups bread flour
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons poppy seeds (optional)
2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, blend together warm water, melted margarine, sugar, and 3 beaten eggs
In a large bowl, mix together yeast, salt, and 7 cups of the flour. Gradually stir in liquid ingredients, and mix until dough holds together.
Knead dough on a floured surface with remaining flour until smooth.
Split the dough into 2 large pieces. Split the 2 large pieces into 3 pieces each. Roll each third into a rope 3/4 inch thick and braid 3 strands together. Repeat. Place shaped dough onto greased cookie sheets. Brush dough with remaining beaten egg.  Add poppy or sesame seeds, if desired. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
Bake in a preheated 325 degree F(165 degrees C) oven for 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Made with quick-rise yeast, this is a sweeter, richer challah that lends itself especially well to Rosh Hashanah or other holiday uses. It is  quicker and easier than a standard double-rise recipe, so it's great for those afternoons when you're in a challah of a hurry. Challah was meant to be torn and not sliced. B'tayevon!
