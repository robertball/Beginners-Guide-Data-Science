Ingredients:
Seasoning Mixture:
2/3 cup sea salt
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
Aioli:
2 egg yolks
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh dill
3/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup olive oil
Pickled Red Onions:
1 pound red onions, sliced into half moons
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Burgers:
6 brioche buns, halved
2 pounds ground beef
9 ounces crumbled goat cheese (chevre)
12 slices heirloom tomatoes
3 cups arugula

Directions:
Combine sea salt, porcini mushrooms, thyme, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a food processor; blend until thoroughly mixed. Pour seasoning mixture into a bowl.
Combine egg yolks, lemon juice, garlic, and dill in the food processor; blend, pouring in canola oil and olive oil in a steady stream until aioli is thick and smooth.
Combine sliced onions, red wine vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper in an airtight container. Let marinate, at least 15 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Spread buns on grill and toast until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a serving platter. Spread some aioli over each half.
Shape ground beef into 6 large patties. Sprinkle seasoning mixture generously over both sides.
Increase grill heat to high. Grill patties until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 4 minutes per side.
Place 1 cooked patty on the bottom of each toasted bun. Top each with 3 tablespoons goat cheese, 2 tomato slices, 1 heaping tablespoon pickled red onions, and 1/2 cup arugula. Cover with top half of the bun.

Description: 
L'il Woody's executive chef Cory Alfano said he was inspired by the fresh flavors of summer when he created this burger served as a weekly special at the beloved Seattle restaurant: Imagine a nice summer Pacific Northwest day and wanting to grill some burgers with friends. Super easy, just go down to your local farmers market and pick up some fresh ingredients from local purveyors to make an amazingly light but meaty late-afternoon grilled burger. Heirloom tomatoes, arugula, red onions, local cheese, and grass-fed beef make this 'Farmers Market Burger' a sure thing.
