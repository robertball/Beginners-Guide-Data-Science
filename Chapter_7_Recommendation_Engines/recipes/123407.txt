Description: 
This fresh-tasting sauce, chock-full of blueberries, tastes great served over pancakes, French toast, waffles or even ice cream. Whether you use fresh or frozen blueberries, the flavor is fantastic...and with only four ingredients, it cooks up in a flash.                                    --Ellen Benninger                                                          Stoneboro, Pennsylvania
