Ingredients:
1 cup celery, diced (about 2-3 stalks)
1 cup onion, diced (about 1 large, white or yellow)
2-3 cloves garlic (minced)
2 green bell peppers (diced)
1 jalapeno pepper (minced)
2 (14.5 ounce) cans of diced tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can of light kidney beans (rinsed and drained)
1 (16 ounce) can of dark kidney beans (rinsed and drained)
1 lb ground turkey breast
1 cup beer (lager)
2-3 Tbsp chili powder
1 Tbsp dried cumin
2 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp Tobasco sauce
2-3 Tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large dutch oven or pot. Saute onion, celery, garlic, and both peppers about 5 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften.  Remove vegetables and set aside.
After lightly seasoning the meat with a little salt and pepper, brown the ground turkey in the same pot.
Return vegetables to pot.  Add the diced tomatoes (with liquid) and both cans of rinsed beans.
Stir in the chili powder, cumin, salt, sugar, worcestershire sauce and Tobasco sauce.
Add beer and heat to a boil.
Turn down heat and simmer for about 1-2 hours, until ingredients are tender and flavors are all melded.
Season with salt and pepper, and serve with crusty bread.  Garnished with cheddar cheese and/or sour cream if desired.

Description: 
After making pot after pot of various chili recipes (vegetarian, 3 bean, beef, chicken and turkey), I decided to create my own chili, using ideas and techniques from the many different recipes I've encountered.  This healthy and hearty chili takes the best of the best and is perfect served with crusty bread on a cool fall evening.
