Ingredients:
4 pkgs beef ramen soup
4 green onions
1 c. shredded cabbage/carrots (bagged cole slaw veggies)
4 tsp minced garlic
1/4 c. soy sauce
3 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp water
4 tbsp oil

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to boil.  Add noodles and boil for just 1-2 minutes (they will cook more later and you don't want them mushy), save 1 seasoning packet for later. Drain and rinse noodles lightly with cold water, tossing lightly to let heat escape, set aside.  Chop green onions and have garlic ready.  In a small bowl mix soy sauce, water, sugar, garlic and 1 seasoning packet, set aside.  Heat wok till almost smoking, then add oil.  When oil is very hot add dry, cooled noodles and toss to coat with oil.  Add cabbage mix.  Cook noodles till slightly crispy, tossing often, approx. 5-7 min. Add soy sauce mixture and green onions, tossing to mix well, cook another 3-4 minutes.  Serve hot!
