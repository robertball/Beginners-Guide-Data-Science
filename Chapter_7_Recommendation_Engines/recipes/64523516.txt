Ingredients:
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
Dash salt
1/3 cup cold butter, cubed
3 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Topping:
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon canola oil
2/3 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup ground almonds
1/3 cup ground hazelnuts
1/4 cup baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon cardamom
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/4 tea
1/4 cup finely chopped candied lemon peel
1/4 cup finely chopped candied orange peel
Glaze:
6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1/4 cup butter, cubed

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Combine water and vanilla extract; gradually add to crumb mixture, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/16-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. round cookie cutter.  Place on un-greased baking sheets.  Bake at 325 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until set.  Remove from pans to wire racks to cool
For topping, in a small bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg and oil.  Combine the oats, flour, nuts, cocoa, baking powder and spices; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.  Fold in candied peels
Drop a rounded tablespoonful of topping on each cookie; gently press down.  Place 2 in. apart on un-greased baking sheets.  Bake at 325 degrees for 13-16 minutes or until set. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool
In a microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate and butter; stir until smooth.  Dip each cookie halfway in chocolate; allow excess to drip off.  Place on waxed paper; let stand until set; store in airtight containers. Yield: about 1-1/2 dozen
