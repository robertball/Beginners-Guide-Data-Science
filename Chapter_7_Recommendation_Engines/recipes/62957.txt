Description: 
This is a salsa with vibrant colors and even more vibrant flavors! It utilizes authentic ingredients that are all adjustable to suit individual tastes! If fresh cactus is not available, canned cactus may be substituted. The final mixture will be a variegated red and green and will be quite wet. This is a delicious and spicy salsa that, when bottled, makes a nice gift!
