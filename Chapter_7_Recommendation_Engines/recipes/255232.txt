2 cups white rice
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
salt to taste
2 cups boiling water

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add rice, garlic powder, and salt. Pour in boiling water to cover rice by about 1 inch; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
