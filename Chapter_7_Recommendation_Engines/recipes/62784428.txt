Ingredients:
2 large cucumbers - peeled
2 jalapenos  chopped
1 large tomato  seeded
2 ears fresh white corn  husked
1 green bell pepper  seeded
2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
1/2 Tbsp red pepper flakes
2 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp sugar
1/2 bunch cilantro

Directions:
Prep all the vegetables, by peeling the cucumber and removing the seeds, rough chopping the peppers and tomato, seeding the tomato (to remove extra juice) and cutting the corn off of the cob.
Put all veggies and cilantro in your food processor and chop until a good salsa size.
Combine all ingredients in a covered bowl, shake to mix well.
Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Serve cold with your favorite chips!

Description: 
We love this with an over abundance of fresh vegetables from the garden. It's spicy, yet cool and refreshing. To lessen the spice, seed the jalapenos or eliminate them according to your tastes. This never lasts long at my house and is requested often!
