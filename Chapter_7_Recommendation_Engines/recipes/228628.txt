Ingredients:
1 pound smoked sausage, finely diced
6 tablespoons chopped onion
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
2 cups half-and-half
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (8 ounce) can sauerkraut, undrained

Directions:
Cook and stir smoked sausage and onion in a large saucepan over low heat until lightly browned, about 15 minutes; stir in flour to coat the sausage and onion. Gradually stir in milk, followed by half-and-half. Raise heat to medium, and simmer the soup until thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in thyme. Mix sauerkraut and its juice into the soup and cook just until sauerkraut is heated through, 1 to 2 more minutes.
