Ingredients:
1 C Ham-chopped
1 C Onion-chopped
2 cloves Garlic-minced
1 Tbsp Oil
3 C Rice cooked in chicken broth(I use 2 bags of Success rice in pouches, so it actually ends up as 4 cups cooked)
16 oz Can Blackeyed peas-rinsed and drained(1 1/2 C frozen)
1 tsp Pepper sauce
1/4 tsp Pepper
1/4 tsp Salt
2 slices Bacon
4 C Cabbage-shredded

Directions:
Cook rice in broth, drain. In large skillet, saute half of the onions and all the garlic in oil. Add ham, stir in rice, peas, pepper sauce, s&p. Cook until heated through and set aside. Cook bacon, set aside, add cabbage into pan with rest of onion and cook until tender crisp. Spoon onto large platter, rice mixture on top of cabbage, and crumble bacon on top. Or do like I do and mix it all together.
