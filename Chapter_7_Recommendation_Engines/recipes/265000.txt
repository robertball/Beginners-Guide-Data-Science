Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups skinless dried fava beans
2 slices bread
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
3 onions, minced
1 head garlic, separated into cloves and peeled
4 tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
2 sprigs parsley
1 sprig fresh mint
1 cup water
2 pounds red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered
1 pound frozen peas
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 ounces butter, softened, or more to taste

Directions:
Place fava beans in a pot and cover with cold water. Soak 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Toast bread in a toaster and allow to cool until dry and hard. Crumble or chop bread into a bowl.
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over low heat. Add drained beans, bread crumbs, onion, garlic cloves, tomatoes, parsley, and mint. Add water and simmer, covered, about 15 minutes.
Add potatoes to the Dutch oven and continue to simmer another 15 minutes, adding a bit more water if necessary. Add peas, mix well, and simmer until beans are tender, about 15 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove parsley and mint sprigs and stir in butter.

Description: 
This is a favorite in different parts of Catalunya during Quaresma (Lent) among the Roman Catholics. Traditionally a meat dish that is easily adapted to fish or vegetables, estofat de Quaresma translates to Lenten Stew created for the pre-Easter period in which the faithful abstain from meat. My grandmother used a hint of fresh rosemary for a more aromatic scent that tempted the palate.
