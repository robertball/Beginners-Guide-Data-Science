Ingredients:
3/4 cup all purpose flour
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/3 cup tightly packed brown sugar
generous 1/4 cup (can substitute semi-sweet chocolate chips)
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste (may substitute vanilla extract)
1 1/4 cups hot water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350.
In a large casserole dish or a square baking pan, stir together the flour, granulated sugar, 1/4 cup of the cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.  Mix in the milk and vegetable oil until the batter is evenly spread in the dish.
Scatter the brown sugar and cocoa powder over the top of the batter.  Scatter the chocolate chunks evenly on top of that.
Combine the vanilla and hot water, then pour over the cake mixture.  Do not mix.  Place in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out mostly clean, with some "sauce" at the bottom.

Description: 
A warm chocolate cake that creates its own sauce.  The best part?  The entire dessert is mixed in the pan it bakes in!  I like my chocolate on the dark side, but feel free to increase the sugars if you prefer more of a milk chocolate flavor.  Either way, the baking process is very forgiving for this recipe.
