Ingredients:
4 Zucchini
1 teaspoon Salt
1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning
4 medium boneless chicken breast
pinch of salt
pinch of pepper
1 cup marinara sauce
4 slices Mozzarella Cheese

Directions:
Using a spiralizer, shred the zucchini into pasta-sized threads and place in a colander. Sprinkle salt and Italian Seasoning onto the zucchini and toss to cover. Let the zucchini sit over a bowl to drain while you prepare the chicken.
Cover each chicken breast with plastic wrap and pound to 1/4' to 1/2" thickness. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
Either in a saucepan or in the microwave, heat the marinara sauce.
Coat a nonstick saute pan with nonstick spray. Saute the chicken breast at medium-high heat until browned and cooked through. Place onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Turn oven broiler on.
Dump zucchini into saute pan and cook on medium-high heat until they are the consistency of al dente pasta.
A few minutes before the zucchini are done, spoon a little marinara sauce onto each chicken breast and cover in a slice of mozzarella cheese. Place in oven until the cheese in melted.
Once the zucchini are done and the cheese is melted, plate the dish. Place a serving of zucchini on the plate with a piece of chicken placed on top. Spoon a small amount of marinara sauce onto the top of the chicken. Finish off with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese, to taste.
