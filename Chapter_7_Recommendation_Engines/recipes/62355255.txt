Ingredients:
5 apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
3/4 cup maple syrup
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 pinch salt
3/4 tsp ground Cinnamon
3/4 tsp ground Nutmeg
1/2 cup butter, softened
(rum raisin ice cream)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place apples in a buttered 8x8 inch baking dish.  In a separate bowl, mix together flour, oats, spices, sugar, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle mixture evenly over apples.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, until topping is golden brown. Remove from oven, fracture the topping and top with syrup, allowing it to infuse the dish. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with ice cream topping.
