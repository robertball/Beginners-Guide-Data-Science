Ingredients:
CAKE
1 box	yellow cake mix
4 large	eggs
1 c	sour cream
3/4 c	vegetable oil
FILLING
1 c	brown sugar
3 tsp	cinnamon
chopped pecans-optional
GLAZE
3 c	powdered sugar
1/2 c	milk
2 tsp	vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°. In a large bowl combine cake mix, eggs, oil and sour cream. Stir until moistened. Now mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Batter will be thick.
2 Grease AND flour a 9x13 cake pan. Pour enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan.
3 Mix filling ingredients then sprinkle over cake batter evenly.
4 Pour the rest of the cake batter over the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and bake at 325° for 45 minutes. Remember oven temps vary so if you feel it is done before the 45 minutes, test it first and if so, pull it out of the oven. I would say check it at 40 minutes if you are concerned your oven temp runs hot.
5 While the cake is still hot, poke holes in it. Mix the glaze then pour evenly over the hot cake. Enjoy!
6 ***You may add nuts of your choice to brown sugar mixture. Pecans are heavenly in this recipe.***

Description: 
I HAVE FOUND IN THE LAST 2 CAKES
I'VE MADE THAT NOT POKING HOLES IN
IT WORKS JUST AS WELL. THE GLAZE
TENDS TO GO A LOT FURTHER THAT WAY
TOO BECAUSE THERE'S NO HOLES FOR IT
TO FALL DOWN INTO. IT TRULY IS JUST
PERSONAL CHOICE.
