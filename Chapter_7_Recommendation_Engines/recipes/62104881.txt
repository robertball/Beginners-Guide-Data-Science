Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons roasted garlic
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 pound crumbled feta
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup half-and-half (optional)

Directions:
Place roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, and white pepper into a blender; puree until smooth. Add feta and cream cheese, and puree until smooth.
With blender running, slowly pour in olive oil until incorporated and thickened. Stir in half-and-half if needed to achieve a dip consistency. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

Description: 
This is a lovely spread for vegetables and bread. You may wish to reduce the lemon juice to taste, but it is supposed to be a tangy spread. Some feta cheeses are terribly salty, you may wish to rinse them a bit before using.
