Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 cup crunchy peanut butter
1/4 cup applesauce
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
4 egg whites
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat butter, peanut butter, applesauce, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs and beat until smooth.
Sift together flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl; stir into peanut butter batter. Put batter in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern.
Bake in preheated oven until cookies begin to brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I love peanut butter cookies but they are always a little greasy. I came up with this healthier version and it's a little less greasy. I love it!
