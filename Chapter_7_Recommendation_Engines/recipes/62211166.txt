Julia Child's potatoes Recipe

Ingredients:
Julia Child might be the answer. She made a gratin in The Way to Cook that is simple and luxurious. Place half & half (or half & half and whole milk for a "lighter version") in a large, deep saucepan over the medium-low heat. Add a few bay leaves, a pinch or two nutmeg, and smashed cloves of garlic or sliced shallots, along with salt to taste.

Directions:
Peel and slice (1/4-inch thick) waxy potatoes, such as yukon gold or white bliss, and drop them, as you slice them, into the pot. Simmer gently until the potatoes are barely tender. Use a slotted spoon to remove the potatoes and place in a buttered casserole. The dish can be made ahead to this point, covered and refrigerated.
The cream mixture will be thickened slightly by the starch from the potatoes (the reason you place them directly in the pot and do not rinse them); if it isn't as thick a slightly reduced cream, simmer until the mixture thickens up.
To bake: Heat the oven to 400. Strain the cream mixture (check for salt and add pepper), and pour over the potatoes to just cover. Sprinkle the top lightly with gruyere or parmesan if you like and bake until hot, bubbly and slightly golden on top.
