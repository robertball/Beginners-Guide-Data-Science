Ingredients:
1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup self-rising flour
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a large baking stone in the oven to preheat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until slightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.
Mix sausage, spinach, Cheddar cheese, flour, egg, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until well combined.
Form mixture into balls and place on the preheated baking stone.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool slightly before enjoying.
