Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup Goya Tomato Sauce
6 Goya Spanish Olives Stuffed with Minced Pimientos, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons Goya Sofrito
1 packet Sazon Goya with Coriander and Annatto
1 teaspoon Goya Minced Garlic
1/2 teaspoon Goya Dried Oregano
Goya Ground Black Pepper, to taste
1 (14 ounce) package Goya Discos (yellow or white), thawed
Goya Corn Oil, for frying

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in tomato sauce, olives, Sofrito, Sazon, garlic, oregano and black pepper. Lower heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.
On a lightly floured work surface, using a rolling pin, roll out discos until 1/2-inch larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tbsp. meat mixture into middle, fold in half to form a half moon; moisten edges with water and pinch to seal closed, or seal with a fork.
Fill a deep saucepan with oil to a depth of 2 1/2-inches. Heat oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking (350 degrees F on deep-fry thermometer). Cook Empanadas in batches until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 - 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
