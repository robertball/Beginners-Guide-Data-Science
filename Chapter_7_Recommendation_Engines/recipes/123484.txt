Ingredients:
4 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups frozen peas
3 medium carrots, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups biscuit/baking mix
1 1/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
Paprika

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine chicken, broth, peas, carrots, soup, salt and pepper; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, combine biscuit mix, milk, garlic powder and celery seed (mixture will be thin). Pour hot chicken mixture into eight greased ovenproof 10-oz. custard cups or casseroles. Immediately spoon 1/4 cup of biscuit mixture evenly on top of each. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until topping is golden brown.

Description: 
I created a new title for my mom's pot pie recipe while trying to come up with a clever menu for our Presidents' Day Party. An old political slogan came to mind that fit the theme and my main dish just fine! It's chock-full of chicken and vegetables. -Mary Beth de Ribeaux, Gaithersburg, Maryland
