Ingredients:
3 cups mashed sweet potatoes
2 cups cooked butternut squash
4 eggs
1/2 cup condensed milk
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust
1 (10 ounce) package mini marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mash together the sweet potatoes and squash in a bowl. Fold the eggs, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice into the potato mixture. Pour the mixture into the pie crust.
Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; arrange marshmallows on top of pie. Bake until a knife inserted into the center of the pie comes out clean, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
This pie has a custard-like filling. I love the unique taste.  I usually don't measure anything, so I say play with the spices until it tastes right!
