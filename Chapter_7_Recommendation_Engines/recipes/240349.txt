Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup cornstarch, or more as needed
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 large pomegranate, peeled and seeds separated
1/2 cup turbinado sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 egg
1/2 cup almond milk
1/2 cup softened butter
2 tablespoons vinegar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar, for sprinkling (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Stir pomegranate seeds, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until seeds are coated with sugar.
Beat egg in a bowl; stir in almond milk, butter, vinegar, and vanilla. Pour egg mixture into pomegranate mixture and stir to combine. Stir egg and pomegranate mixture into flour mixture to make a soft dough.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. If dough is too sticky, sprinkle with a bit of cornstarch. Roll or pat dough into a 3/4-inch thick round; cut into wedges and transfer to a baking sheet. Sprinkle dough with 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Crunchy tender scones with a sweet/tart flavor. I've have successfully substituted whole wheat pastry flour, soy milk, and vanilla paste. When I use a dark baking sheet or a glass baking dish, I reduce the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C).
