Ingredients:
1 pound dry ziti pasta
1 onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound lean italian sausage or lean ground beef or turkey
2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
1/4 teaspoon (or to taste) crushed & dried (pizza) pepper
8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
1 1/2 cups sour cream
8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain. Toss the hot & drained pasta with the sour cream until well combined.
In a large skillet, brown the sausage with garlic and onion over medium heat. Add spaghetti sauce and crushed peppers and simmer 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Combine the pasta with the sausage and spaghetti sauce mixture. Stir in 8 oz of mozzarella. Pour mixture into pan. Top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheeses are melted.
