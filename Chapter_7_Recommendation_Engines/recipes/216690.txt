Ingredients:
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced fat condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can skim milk
1 1/4 cups cubed mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons pressurized canned cheese spread (such as Cheez WhizÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried parsley
5 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
7 large russet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
sea salt to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the onion, green pepper, mushroom soup, milk, mozzarella cheese, cheese spread, celery seed, paprika, and parsley until thoroughly combined. Pour 1/4 of the sauce into the bottom of a slow cooker. Spread the potatoes over the sauce; pour the remaining sauce over the potatoes. Place chicken breasts into the slow cooker, sprinkle with a pinch or 2 of sea salt, and push the chicken down into the sauce mixture.
Cook on low for 6 hours, then set cooker to high and cook until chicken and potatoes are very tender, 4 additional hours. During the last hour of cooking, mix cornstarch with water, and stir into the sauce to thicken.
