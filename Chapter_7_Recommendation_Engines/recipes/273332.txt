Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
4 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry mustard
3 1/2 cups milk
1 (8 ounce) package sharp white Cheddar cheese (such as Cracker Barrel), shredded
1/2 (8 ounce) package processed cheese (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed
1 cup bread crumbs, or as needed
1 pinch paprika, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, for 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Stir in flour, salt, and dry mustard and mix well. Return to heat; pour in milk, stirring constantly until mixture is simmering, thick, and smooth. Add white Cheddar cheese and processed cheese; stir occasionally until melted.
Pour cooked macaroni into a large baking dish, followed by sauce. Stir to combine. Top with bread crumbs. Sprinkle with paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread crumbs are golden brown and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
