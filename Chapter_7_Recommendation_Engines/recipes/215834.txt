Description: 
I make pumpkintinis every fall and the recipe calls for maple liqueur. Well, you'd think that would be easy to find but it has been near impossible! My friend and I found 4 bottles in our state. So I decided to do some research and this is what I found and YUMMY....it's perfecto! Try a little in your coffee or your baked beans, experiment. It is delicious!
