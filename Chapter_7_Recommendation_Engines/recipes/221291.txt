Ingredients:

1/4 cup hot salsa
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1/4 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/4 teaspoons hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1/2 cup mayonnaise

Directions:
Scoop avocado meat into a bowl and mash with a fork. Stir salsa, garlic powder, chili powder, and hot pepper sauce into mashed avocados.
Spread mayonnaise over guacamole. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; chill in refrigerator for about 1 hour. Stir mayonnaise into guacamole just before serving.

Description: 
This is almost easier than making it with a mix and a lot tastier! The best part is that you can make it with ingredients already in the fridge. I would suggest making a double batch though, because this is a crowd pleaser. This is also great with lime salsa.
