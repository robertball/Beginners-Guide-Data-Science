Ingredients:
1 medium yellow onion, peeled and thinly sliced
1 medium carrot, peeled and julienned
6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
2 cups sliced bok choy
4 cups Vegetable Stock or low-sodium vegetable stock
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
Zest and juice of 1 lime
1 serrano chile, stemmed and sliced into thin rounds (for less heat, remove the seeds)
6 ounces brown rice noodles, cooked according to package directions, drained, and kept warm
1 cup mung bean sprouts
½ cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Place the onion, carrot, and mushrooms in a medium pot and sauté for 7 to 8 minutes. Add water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time to keep the vegetables from sticking to the pan.
Add the garlic, ginger, bok choy, vegetable stock, soy sauce, lime zest and juice, and serrano chile. Bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes.
To serve, divide the noodles between four individual bowls. Pour the broth over the ingredients and garnish with the mung bean sprouts and cilantro.
