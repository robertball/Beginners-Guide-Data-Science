Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 yellow onion, diced small
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 stalks celery, diced small
1 large carrot, diced
1 quart reduced-sodium butternut squash soup
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons ras el hanout, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
1 cup frozen peas, rinsed and drained
1/3 cup raisins

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a deep pot over medium heat.
Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned on both sides, but still slightly underdone in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side; remove to a cutting board to cool.
Stir onion into the oil in the pot; saute until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Stir celery and carrot into the onion mixture; saute together until until the celery and carrot begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the pot, and sweat the vegetable mixture until softened completely, about 10 minutes.
Pour butternut squash soup and chicken broth into the pot; stir and bring to a simmer. Season the soup mixture with ras el hanout, cinnamon, salt, and pepper; stir. Replace cover to the pot and cook mixture at a simmer for 40 minutes.
Cut the partially cooked chicken breasts into chunks; add to the soup mixture along with any juices that have collected on the cutting board. Stir peas and raisins into the soup mixture; simmer until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more.
