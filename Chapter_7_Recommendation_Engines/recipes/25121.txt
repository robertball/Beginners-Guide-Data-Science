In 3 quart microwaveable bowl, combine the sugar, butter and evaporated milk. Cook on high power for 2 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the mixture comes to a rapid boil.

Description: 
My grandmother had made no-bake cookies so much, she was never seen looking at the recipe. This recipe was obtained from a local nursing home and is so easy my 9 year old makes them and the flavor is changeable to your taste. I generally make 2 batches so that we don't have to store half a can of evaporated milk. Our favorite flavors are made with chocolate fudge or butterscotch pudding.
