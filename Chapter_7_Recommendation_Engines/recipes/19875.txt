Ingredients:
20 pods snow peas
1 (8 ounce) container herb and garlic flavored cream cheese, softened
1 bunch spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried

Directions:
Remove string from pods and trim off the blossom end. Make a small slit on flat side of pod.  Soak pods in ice water for about 1 1/2 hours.  Drain and dry pods.
Put cream cheese in a pastry bag and pipe enough cheese into pods until full.  Arrange pods on a platter lined with spinach or lettuce. Garnish each pod with a bit of cream cheese studded with the appropriate number of peas, depending on how many the mother-to-be is expecting.
