Ingredients:
6 hard boiled eggs (or as many as you want)
3 Tbsp mayonnaise
2 Tbsp dijon mustard
1/3 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 tsp cilantro (I used dried, fresh can be used)
2 Tbsp diced red onion
Ground cayenne pepper to taste
Garlic powder to taste
Ground black pepper to taste
Sliced black olives for garnish
1 Tbsp cholula for garnish (or to taste)

Directions:
Hard boil the eggs. For the correct timing and method, I used this link:
Let the eggs cool down, then peel them. After they are peeled, cut each one in half and carefully scoop the yolk into a mixing bowl.
Add mustard, mayo, cilantro, cayenne, garlic powder, black pepper and mix into a custard-like paste.
Mix in 2/3 of the grated cheddar and diced onion.
Once the filling has the taste you want, scoop about 1.5 Tbsp into each eggwhite half. I use a fork for this, as it is easier to get the filling off of than a spoon.
After filling each eggwhite half, top with remaining cheddar and olive slices. Then drizzle a few drops of cholula onto each egg.
