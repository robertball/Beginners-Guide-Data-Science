Description: 
We love this dish at our house, and whenever I take it to a potluck, it disappears just as quickly as it does at home. This pleasing recipe was given to me by my sister-in-law from Louisiana. I've made some changes in the ingredients, but the snappy Cajun flavor is still there. It's easy to increase for any number of guests.
