Description: 
Mama did not always feel like cooking right away; here was a little snack to hold us over. Easy to do, with few ingredients already in your fridge and cabinets. Best served with RitzÂ® crackers, but you can spread on your favorite slice of bread and make a sandwich, if you prefer. Refrigerate when finished.
