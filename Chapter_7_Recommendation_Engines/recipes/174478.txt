Description: 
My two friends and I went to Salem, MA last year and had a ball. We went to a restaurant and had a 'pumpkintini'.  Ever since, I've been experimenting with different ingredients and finally found a mixture that is OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you like pumpkin pie, you will LOVE this delicious beverage recipe.
