Ingredients:
3/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (1 1/2-pound) beef flank steak

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients; add flank steak.  Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill.  Drain and discard marinade.  Grill steak, covered, over medium heat 6-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).  Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
'I use this great marinade not just for beef, but for everything I grill-from pork chops to chicken,' notes Sue Sauer of Deer River, Minnesota.  'The marinade's main ingredient-orange juice- is both low in calories and a good tenderizer.'
