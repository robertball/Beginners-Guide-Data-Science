Description: 
This is an extremely quick pie recipe when you find out you need to have a pie for dinner but don't have all day to make it.  If you don't want to bother making the crust, you can purchase one.  I find sprinkling it with cinnamon and ginger, and baking at 350 for 2 minutes adds a nice flavor.
