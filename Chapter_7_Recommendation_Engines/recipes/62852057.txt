1 cup all-purpose flour (about 4 1/2 ounces)
1 cup semolina flour (about 6 1/4 ounces)
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons extravirgin olive oil
2 large eggs Sauce:
2 bacon slices, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces
4 cups thinly sliced onion
1 tablespoon extravirgin olive oil
4 garlic cloves, crushed
1/2 cup water
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained (such as San Marzano)
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Remaining ingredients:
6 quarts water

1/2 cup (2 ounces) finely chopped fresh mozzarella cheese
6 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
To prepare pasta, lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flours in a food processor; process 30 seconds. Combine 1/3 cup water, 2 tablespoons oil, and eggs in a bowl, stirring well with a whisk. With processor running, slowly pour water mixture through food chute, processing just until dough forms a ball. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead lightly 5 times. Shape dough into a disk. Dust dough lightly with flour; wrap in plastic wrap. Let stand 30 minutes.
Divide dough into 6 equal portions. Working with 1 portion at a time (cover remaining dough to prevent drying), press dough portion into a flat narrow rectangle. Roll the dough into a 20 x 4–inch rectangle, dusting with flour, if necessary (turning dough over occasionally and dusting surface with flour). Lay pasta sheet flat; cover. Repeat procedure with remaining dough portions to form 6 sheets.
sauce:cook bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Add onion, 1 tablespoon oil, and garlic to drippings in pan; sauté 5 minutes or until browned, stirring frequently. Add 1/2 cup water and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until slightly thick, stirring occasionally.
Bring 6 quarts water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Slowly lower 1 pasta sheet into boiling water; cook 1 1/2 minutes or until done. Carefully remove pasta from water with a slotted spoon; lay pasta flat on a jelly-roll pan covered with a damp towel; cover. Repeat procedure with remaining pasta sheets.
