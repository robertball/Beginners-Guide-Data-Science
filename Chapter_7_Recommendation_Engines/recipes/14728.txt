Ingredients:
8 pork chops
2 quarts water
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons shortening
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup hot water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place pork chops in an oven-safe pan, pour in 2 quarts water and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Remove pork from broth and set aside and keep warm.
Cut the shortening in the flour and 1 teaspoon salt until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add hot water until it forms ball. Place dough on a floured surface and roll out to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 2 inch squares.
Place pan full of broth on medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Drop biscuits in and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Serve spooned over cooked pork chops.
