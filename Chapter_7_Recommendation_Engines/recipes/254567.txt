Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 pounds potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1-inch cubes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound bacon
1 1/2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, divided
1 onion, minced
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 bunch chives, diced, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Season potatoes with salt and pepper and spread in the baking pan.
Roast potatoes in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble into smaller pieces.
Combine 3/4 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, onion, sour cream, mayonnaise, and most of the chives in a large bowl. Stir in potatoes and crumbled bacon. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and chives.
Refrigerate salad before serving, 4 hours to overnight.
