Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, skin removed and cut into pieces
3  onions, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  bay leaf
2 cloves crushed garlic
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon paprika
3 tablespoons curry powder
½ teaspoon white sugar
½  lemon, juiced
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 pinch salt
¼ cup olive oil
water to cover

Directions:
Fry the onions in olive oil until browned. Add the cinnamon and the bay leaf. Continue stirring and add the ginger, paprika, curry powder, sugar, salt, and garlic. Continue stirring for 2 minutes.  Mixture will become much like a paste.
Add chicken pieces and tomato. Add enough water to just cover the chicken.  Simmer until chicken is done, about 20 minutes.
Just before serving, add the lemon juice and the cayenne pepper.  Simmer for 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This is a very old family recipe.  It's everybody's favorite.  Curry should be cooked slowly for a long time to get the best flavor.  I often cook it the day before for even better flavor.  Serve over rice.
