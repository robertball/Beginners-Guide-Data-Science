Ingredients:
olive-oil cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) tube prepared polenta, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds
1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1 cup sliced onion
1 cup sliced red bell pepper
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup cubed zucchini
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray. Arrange the polenta slices on the sheet and spray them lightly with cooking spray. Broil until lightly browned about 5 minutes; turn and broil other side for 5 minutes. Keep warm.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage, breaking it up as it browns. When sausage has lost any pink color, add the onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, and Italian seasoning. Cook until vegetables are crisp tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the spaghetti sauce and cook until heated through and just starting to simmer.
To serve, spoon the sauce on slices of polenta. Top with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
Refrigerated polenta with a stove top sauce. We prefer the flavored polenta and spicy Italian sausage and also use spicy Italian seasoning to give it some more kick, but you can also use the regular sausage and Italian seasoning.  This will serve 4 to 6 people.
