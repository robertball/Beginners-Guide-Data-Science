Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening

Directions:
Cook flour and milk over low heat until thick.
Cream together sugar, butter and shortening until smooth.  (Sounds greasy, but it is good and mixes in.)
When the flour mixture is cool add a small amount to the sugar mixture and beat. Continue to add small amounts of the flour and milk mixture to the sugar mixture until it is all mixed in.  Whip until it is has the texture of whipped cream.  This is best when it is made a few hours or the day before. Enjoy!!
