Ingredients:
1 large red grapefruit
6 large mint leaves
1/2 sprig fresh dill
1/2 tsp Chinese rice white vinegar
1.5 tbsp avocado oil
1/4 tsp course ground black pepper
1 large ripe avocado
1/4 cup Belgian endive, sliced thin
1/8 tsp hibiscus salt (optional)
2 tsp fresh minced jalapeno (optional)

Directions:
Peel the grapefruit. Separate the sections, peeling away the white pith and the white membrane from each section leaving clean segments. Add to a bowl. Set aside.
Put one segment of peeled grapefruit, mint leaves, dill (fronds only), vinegar, and oil in a mini blender. Pulse a few times to create a vinaigrette.
Peel and seed the avocado. Cut it into one inch pieces. Add to the grapefruit. Add the sliced Belgian endive. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad and toss to coat. Let rest in the refrigerator for an hour. Top with course ground black pepper, hibiscus salt, and minced jalapeno before serving.
Cook's Note: If you don’t have Chinese vinegar, use another low acid vinegar. If you don’t have avocado, simply use any very light,neutral flavored vegetable oil
