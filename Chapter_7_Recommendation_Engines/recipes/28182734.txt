Ingredients:
4 C Flour
1/2 t Salt
1 Pkg. Dry Yeast
1/2 C Sugar
3 Sticks Butter
3 Egg Yolks
1 C Sour Cream
1 t Vanilla
Filling:
5 Egg Whites
1 & 1/2 C Granulated Sugar
1 & 1/2 C Walnuts Ground Fine
1 & 1/2 C Pecans Ground Fine
2 t Vanilla
1 lb. Confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Sift flour and salt in large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over flour. Cut in butter until mealy. In a small bowl beat together egg yolks, sour cream, sugar and vanilla. Make a well in the flour and pour in liquid mixture. Knead until smooth. Cover and refrigerate at least one hour (best overnight). Make the filling beating the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold in sugar, nuts and vanilla, set aside. After one hour, enough time for dough to be good and cold, form it into a ball and flatten until it resembles a very thick pizza dough using plenty of confectioners sugar' to keep from sticking. Cut into 8 triangles. Roll the triangles into balls, wrap with cellophane and return to fridge until ready to use. Again, using plenty of confectioners' sugar to keep from sticking, roll each ball, one at a time into a thin 10 to 12 inch round, like a thin pie crust. Cut into 10 triangles and fill each with 1 teaspoon nut filling. Roll into crescents and place on an un-greased cookie sheet close together. Bake at 375*F for 15 to 18 minutes. Remove and place on cooling rack. Immediately sift plenty of confectioners' sugar over top of cookies.
