Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
1 c. raw almonds
1 c. raw cashews
1/2 lb. mushrooms, chopped
1 large clove garlic, chopped
1 can pinto beans
1 small can black olives
1 cup cooked brown rice
1/4 cup ground flaxseed
Dash worcestershire sauce
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vegetarian Better than Bouillon (do not add water)
1 cup parmesan cheese

Directions:
Chop first 8 ingredients in food processor.  I do it in batches so it doesn't get too mushy.  Then mix in the remaining ingredients by hand.  Refrigerate for about an hour.  Form into patties and place on nonstick cooking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes, turning once.  At this point you can brown in a fry pan, throw on the grill to brown, or freeze to use later.

Description: 
After trying many different recipes for a healthier, non soy veggie burger I came up with this.  It's really versatile and you can use any combination of nuts and beans.
