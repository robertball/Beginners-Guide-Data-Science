Ingredients:
8 oz blue crab meat
¼ C minced green pepper
¼ C minced red onion
1 small peach, peeled, stone removed, (small dice) (the peach should still be a little hard, not too ripe/ juicy)
¼ tsp Old Bay seafood seasoning
1 TBSP minced fresh basil (or cilantro)
1 lime, zested and juiced so you get: 1 tsp lime juice, and ½ tsp grated lime zest
1-2 TBSP mayonnaise
1-3 TBSP bread crumbs
1-2 TBSP Olive oil

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
Use the olive oil to grease a cookie sheet.
Mix crab together with all ingredients except mayonnaise and bread crumbs. Peaches are juicy, so adjust your mayonnaise to account for how wet your mixture is – you want it to be moist, but the mayo is a binder only. Add breadcrumbs, 1 TBSP at a time, just until the mixture will hold together in a ball.
Form small, one to one and a half inch diameter, bite sized balls of the crab mix and place on the greased cookie sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Let cool on the sheet for 5 minutes before using a spatula to remove to another plate. Serve right away.

Description: 
Being from the Chesapeake Bay area, I eat crabs all summer long, but buying fresh peaches from a road side stand is what really means summer to me. I came up with this as way to put two of my favorite summer flavors together. You can use either fresh basil or cilantro in this recipe, but fresh is the key!
