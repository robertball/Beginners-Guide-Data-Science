Ingredients:
10 oz. pkg. frozen chopped spinach
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1/2 stick butter, melted
1/2 cup grated Parmesan
1 cup finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup bottled Blue Cheese dressing
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
8.5 oz. box corn muffin mix

Directions:
Microwave spinach & thoroughly drain excess water.
Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap & refrigerate several hours (or overnight).  NOTE: Batter will be sticky & very difficult to scoop out if not thoroughly chilled.
To cook, preheat over to 325 degrees.
Scoop mixture into small balls, using small melon baller or 1/2 teaspoons onto ungreased non-stick cookie sheet.
Bake at 325 for 10 minutes.  Remove to wire racks to cool.  (Store refrigerated in air-tight container)
