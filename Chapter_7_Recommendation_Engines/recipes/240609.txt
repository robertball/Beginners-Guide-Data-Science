Ingredients:
1 cup boysenberry syrup
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Stir boysenberry syrup and Dijon mustard together in a bowl until glaze is well-combined.
Place ham, cut-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Generously brush about 1/2 of the glaze over the ham and cover ham loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until almost completely heated through, about 3 hours. Remove and discard aluminum foil, brush ham with remaining glaze, and continue baking until ham is completely heated through, 25 to 30 minutes more.

Description: 
I was tired of using the cola ham glaze that I had made so many times in the past, so I created this glaze on a ham we made during Thanksgiving. This ham was so popular that I am making the same exact ham for Easter.
