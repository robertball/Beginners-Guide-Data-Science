Ingredients:
cans of biscuits
oil
confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Take the can biscuits and make a hole in the center of each biscuit (like the top of a medicine bottle, small glass, etc.). Set aside.
Heat cooking oil in the skillet or pot. When hot, place several donuts/holes in the pot, turning frequently, as they cook fast.
Place hot donuts/holes on paper towels to soak up some of the oil. While still hot, dip the donuts/holes in confectioner's sugar which has been mixed with a little bit of water to make an icing consistency. Place on place for serving.
