Ingredients:
2 pounds Hamburger
4.2 ounce pkg Roast Beef Gravy
8 ounce pkg Cream Cheese
8 ounces Sour Cream
1 Can Cream of Mushroom Soup
1 Cup Milk
Pepper seasoned to your liking
1/2 Cup Onion
12 ounce pkg Bow Tie Pasta or Rotini Pasta
4 cups of water

Directions:
Set crockpot on high setting. Place hamburger, gravy, cream cheese, sour cream, cream of mushroom, milk, pepper and onion in crockpot. Cook on high for 2 hours, lower temperature to low and cook an additional 4 hours. Place bow tie pasta in crockpot with stroganoff add water as needed adding a 1/2 cup to cup at a time as needed, cook an additional 30-45 minutes. Turn crockpot off let set for 20 minutes to thicken up before serving.
Alternative cooking directions for stovetop : In a large pot crumble hamburger meat and fry until brown and juices run clear. Drain grease and put hamburger back in pan. Add onion, pepper, and cream of mushroom soup to hamburger mix well; add cream cheese to mixture until well blended than add sour cream until well blended also. Add roast beef gravy, milk, water, pasta; cover and cook over medium to high heat for 45 minutes add additional water if needed. Remove lid, lower heat to simmer for additional 25 mins. This method may be a preference for those that prefer a stroganoff without a heavy sauce since this method provides less of one. Rotini pasta works well making it this way.
