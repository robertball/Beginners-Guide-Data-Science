Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
3/4 cup rolled oats (optional)
4 large ripe bananas
1 cup turbinado sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup canola oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with liners.
Sift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Stir in walnuts and oats.
Combine bananas, sugar, almond milk, canola oil, vanilla extract, and vinegar in a separate bowl. Blend together until smooth. Add to the flour mixture. Stir until just combined.
Drop batter into the muffin cups, filling each completely full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 23 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
