Description: 
Banana Mud Ice Cream does not taste like it is healthy! It is a good alternative to chocolate ice cream. There is no sugar added but still delicious. Must like bananas. The riper the banana, the naturally sweeter but also stronger the banana taste. My friend prefers almost green banana ice cream. I prefer riper and sweeter. You can put frozen banana only (no other ingredients at all) in a mini food processor by itself. That is a 1 ingredient treat. All the ingredients besides banana are optional. This recipe is one my husband loves. He doesn't like the simple versions.
