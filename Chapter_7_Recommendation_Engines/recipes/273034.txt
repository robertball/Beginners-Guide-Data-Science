Ingredients:
3 pounds first-cut brisket (or flat-cut), trimmed of fat
4 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
For the Braising Liquid:
2 tablespoons butter
1 large yellow onion, sliced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
4 cloves garlic, sliced
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1 cup apple juice

Directions:
Season both sides of the brisket generously with salt, pepper, and cayenne. For best results, place brisket over an aluminum foil "rack" set over a plate and refrigerate, uncovered, 8 to 12 hours.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, rosemary, and apple juice. Increase heat to high and boil until liquid is reduced by about half, about 3 minutes.
Transfer half of the apple-onion mixture into a baking dish. Place brisket fat-side up on top; cover with remaining apple-onion mixture. Cover baking dish tightly with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) and bake until fork-tender, about 2 hours 15 minutes.  Check for doneness after 2 hours.
Transfer brisket to a plate and tent with foil.
Pour the onions and braising liquid into a large measuring cup or bowl. Skim some fat off the top. Puree with a stick blender to create a gravy.
Slice brisket across the grain and serve with the gravy.

Description: 
For a brisket recipe, this is considered very fast. The convention of cooking it low and slow often results in dried-out meat that never reaches the proper internal temperature. Instead of waiting all day and risking such disappointment, we dial up the temperature slightly and bake it in about half the time to ensure it's both tender and moist. Garnish with chives if desired.
