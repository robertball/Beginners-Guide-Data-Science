Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
oil for frying
1 eggplant, cut into 1/8-inch slices

Directions:
Shake flour, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag.
Pour oil into a large iron skillet over medium heat. Coat a handful eggplant slices with the flour mixture. Add to the hot oil; cook until crisp and light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove slices carefully and move to a plate or cooling rack; cover with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining eggplant slices.
