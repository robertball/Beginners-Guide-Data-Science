Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1 cup mashed ripe papaya
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup diced crystallized ginger
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 5x7-inch loaf pans.
Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs; beat until lightly fluffy. Beat in bananas, papaya, raisins, walnuts, and crystallized ginger until batter is smooth.
Sift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Mix gradually into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I was trying to use up some papaya and ripe bananas and found a papaya bread recipe that I could easily modify. I loved the idea of adding ginger to give it a bit of a bite. It turned out amazing and I've had several requests for the recipe already! Enjoy. Serve at room temperature or warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
