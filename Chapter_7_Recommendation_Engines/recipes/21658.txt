Ingredients:
1 pound sage flavored ground breakfast sausage
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce
2 packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 cups warm buttermilk (105 to 115 degrees F/43 to 46 degrees C)
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon salt
1 cup shortening
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
To make the gravy:  Crumble sausage in skillet and cook over medium-low heat.  Add onion and cook until tender; drain. Stir in flour, a little at a time, for about 6 minutes or until bubbly and golden.   Stir in milk, nutmeg, poultry seasoning, salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and cook until thick.
To make biscuits:  Dissolve yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.  Stir in buttermilk and set aside.  In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt.  Cut in shortening with pastry blender until looks like coarse meal.  Stir in yeast-buttermilk mix and mix well.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 3 to 4 times.  Roll out flat to 1/2 inch and cut with 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter.  Place on lightly greased baking sheet and cover.  Let rise in warm place 1 1/2 hrs.
Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden.  Remove from oven and brush tops with melted butter.
