Ingredients:
4 fully-cooked turkey breakfast sausage patties
4 eggs
4 tablespoons milk
Salt and pepper
2 teaspoons butter
2 slices American cheese, halved
Ketchup
Pickles

Directions:
Heat sausage according to package directions; keep warm.
Beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper in bowl until blended.
Heat butter in nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot.  Pour in egg mixture. As eggs begin to set, gently pull the eggs across the pan with an inverted turner, forming large soft curds.
Continue cooking--pulling, lifting and folding eggs--until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains. Do not stir constantly.  Remove from heat.
Place sausage patties on microwave-safe plate. Top evenly with eggs, then  with cheese. Microwave on High a few seconds, just to melt cheese. Top with ketchup and pickles. Serve immediately.
