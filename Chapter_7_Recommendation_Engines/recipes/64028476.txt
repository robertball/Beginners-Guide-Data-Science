Ingredients:
Juice from 1 large lime (2-3 tablespoons)
1 1/2 tsp. curry powder
2 tsp. vegetable or olive oil
1 lb. chicken tenders
Salt and pepper to taste
Lime wedges for garnish
Salsa:
1 1/2 cups diced pineapple
1/3 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 avocado, diced
1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice
3 Tbsp. chopped cilantro
Pinch of salt
Sauce:
3 Tbsp. sweet chili sauce
1 Tbsp. honey
1 1/2 tsp. soy sauce
1 Tbsp. warm water

Directions:
Place lime juice, curry powder, and oil in a zip-top bag and shake lightly to combine. Add chicken tenders and marinate at least 30 minutes, and up to 4 hours. Preheat grill or indoor grill pan to medium-high heat and lightly oil grill grates. Remove chicken from marinade and sprinkle both sides lightly with salt and pepper. Grill chicken about 3 minutes on each side, or until internal temperature registers 165 degrees F.
For the salsa: Combine all salsa ingredients and gently toss to combine. Refrigerate until ready to use.
For the sauce: Combine sweet chili sauce, honey, soy sauce, and warm water and whisk with a fork until smooth.
To serve, plate grilled chicken tenders, top with salsa, and drizzle with sauce. Serve with lime wedges if desired.
