2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
3/8 cup heavy cream

Remove stems from mushrooms. Arrange caps in the baking dish. Finely chop stems.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and mix in onion and garlic. Cook 5 minutes, or until tender, then mix in bacon, spinach, chopped mushroom stems and heavy cream. Bring cream to a boil. Remove from heat and mix in Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.
