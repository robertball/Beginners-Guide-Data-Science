Spinach, fresh, 1 cup, chopped
Cream Cheese, 3 tbsp
Mozzarella Cheese, part skim milk, 1 oz, shredded

Directions:
Pound out chicken breast(s) to about 1/4 in. thickness. Mix together cream cheese, shredded mozzarella, chopped spinach, 1/2 the pepper & chives. Spread cheese mixture onto chicken. Roll so that cheese mixture is inside of chicken and not easy for mixture to ooze out. Sprinkle on remaining pepper & some of your favorite herbs/seasonings.
