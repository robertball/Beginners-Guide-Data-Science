Ingredients:
3 zucchini, cut in half lengthwise
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 egg
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Scrape the seeds and some of the meat from each zucchini and transfer to a bowl; add 3/4 of the Mexican cheese blend, corn, egg, salt, and pepper and mix well. Spoon corn mixture into the hollowed-out zucchini shells and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over each stuffed zucchini and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
