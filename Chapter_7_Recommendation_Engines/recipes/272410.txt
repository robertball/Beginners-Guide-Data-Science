Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 sticks butter at room temperature
3 cups light brown sugar
3 large eggs
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x13-inch baking pans with cooking spray.
Whisk together 3 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Toss chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon flour in another medium bowl until lightly coated.
Beat butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, vanilla, and almond extract; mix well. Gradually add flour mixture, mixing on low speed. Fold in chocolate chips.
Divide batter evenly between the 2 prepared pans. Spread thinly with the back of a metal spoon; bars will rise when baking.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 22 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into squares.
