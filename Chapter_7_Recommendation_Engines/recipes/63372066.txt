Ingredients:
2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 Tbsp honey
1 T tomato paste
1/4 to 1/2 tsp red Chile flakes (to taste)
1 tsp olive or coconut oil
1 medium shallot, finely diced
1 bunch Swiss chard, sliced into 1-inch pieces, stems and leaves separated
Sea salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, honey, tomato paste, and Chile flakes.  Set aside.
Heat a large 10-12 inch saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add oil and shallot and saute for 1 minute, until translucent.  Add chard stems to pan and saut√© for about 1 minute.  Add chard leaves, stir and continue to cook for another 2 minutes.  Season with salt and black pepper and pour mixture into a bowl.
Return pan to heat and pour tomato paste mixture into pan.  (Be careful; Vinegar will boil immediately, resulting in strong fumes.  Keep your face away from the pan.)  Stir well and allow liquid to reduce for about 30 to 60 seconds so that is thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat.
Place chard onto a serving platter and drizzle with sauce.  Serve immediately.

We love Swiss chard!  This recipe is delicious AND healthy.  I like to make it with the rainbow-colored Swiss chard when I can find it.
