Ingredients:
1 recipe whole wheat pastry for a double crust
¼ cup butter
1  onion, thinly sliced
1  carrot, sliced thin
1  turnip, peeled and diced
1 large potato, peeled and diced
¼ pound mushrooms, chopped
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon yeast extract spread
¼ cup milk
1  egg
¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1  egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Divide pastry dough into four equal portions and roll each one out in a square shape. Set pastry aside to rest.
Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add butter or margarine and allow to melt. Add onion and saute for 5 minutes, until translucent and beginning to brown. Add carrot, turnip, potato, mushrooms, and water. Lower heat and cover skillet. Allow mixture to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast extract in milk. Whisk in 1 egg. Stir this mixture into cooked vegetables. Continue to stir until mixture thickens. Add cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to cool.
Place 1/4 of filling on one half of each pastry square. Fold pastry diagonally and seal edges. Brush tops of pastry with beaten egg.
Place pasties on a baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until pastry is golden brown.
