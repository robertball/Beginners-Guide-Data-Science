Description: 
This is a recipe that I came up with by combining ideas from different recipes. This is a rich and hearty beef vegetable soup that can easily be modified to taste, and the veggies can be varied. Leftover beef roast greatly reduces the cook time. This recipe is for a large quantity so that dinner portions can be frozen for use later.
