Description: 
The Indian-flavored main course uses one basic spice rub. Half is rubbed on the lamb chops, and the other half is mixed with yogurt to marinate the chicken. If you want the chicken, lamb and sausage to come off the grill at the same time, stagger them, starting with the chicken, then the lamb and finally the pre-steamed sausages, which simply need to be browned. Grill in batches for a larger crowd, cooking all the drumsticks, then all the sausages and finally the chops. The drumsticks are fine at room temperature, but the sausage and chops should be at least warm.
