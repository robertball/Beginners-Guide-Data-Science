Ingredients:
1 lb. (16 ounces) Dried Black Eyed Peas
2 or 3 Smoked Ham Hocks
1 Carton Chicken Stock (64 oz)
Water
1 cup diced carrots
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced celery
2 bay leaves
2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon pepper
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Wash, sort and drain peas. Place in a stock pot or soup pan. Add chicken stock and enough water to cover 4-6 inches above peas.
Bring water to a rolling boil, then turn down heat to a simmer. Add Ham Hocks, Bay leaves and 1/2 teaspoon pepper
While beans are simmering, sauté carrots in oil for about 2 minutes, then add celery and onions. Sauté until tender and onions are translucent; about 3 or 4 more minutes.
Add sautéed vegetables to beans and bring back to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer and continue cooking until peas are done. Approximately 45 min to 1 hour.

Description: 
On New Year's Day, it is our family's tradition to eat Black Eyed Peas for Good Luck in the upcoming year. This is an old recipe my mother used to prepare and it's still just as good today as it was when my Mama fixed it.
