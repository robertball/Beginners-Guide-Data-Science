Ingredients:
4 pounds beef brisket
4 cups water
1 (15 ounce) can coconut milk
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon red curry paste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 bay leaves
1 onion, cut into large chunks
2 stalks celery, cut into large chunks
2 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
1/2 small head cabbage, cored and cut into large chunks

Directions:
Place brisket, fat-side up, in the bottom of a Dutch oven. Stir in water, coconut milk, tomato paste, fish sauce, red curry paste, coriander, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that accumulates.
Stir in onion, celery, and carrots. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 3 hours, turning once.
Stir in potatoes and cabbage; cook until potatoes are tender and cabbage is soft and sweet, about 35 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate; thinly slice across the grain. Ladle potato cabbage mixture into bowls and top with sliced beef.

Description: 
I was craving corned beef and cabbage recently, but the thought of doing the same old New England boiled dinner had me yawning. I tried to think of some new, interesting braising liquid, and that's when I remembered I've never had something stewed in coconut milk that I didn't like. The coconut milk gave the broth a subtle sweetness and richness that I was really happy with.
