Ingredients:
For the spiced pepitas:
1/2 cup hulled, raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
2 teaspoons olive oil
1-1/2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
For the dressing:
1/3 cup fresh lime juice (about 3 limes)
2 teaspoons finely minced chipotles in adobo sauce
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
For the salad (everything “chopped,” should be cut into about 1/4 to 1/2-inch dice):
4 cups packed, roughly chopped arugula or mixed baby greens (or a combination of both)
1/2 cup roughly chopped, cilantro leaves
1-1/2 cups chopped jicama
1-1/2 cups chopped tomato, seeds removed
1-1/2 cups chopped, ripe avocado
1 cup chopped roasted, peeled and seeded poblano chili peppers (about 2 medium-sized peppers  learn how to roast them here)
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup grated Manchego cheese

Directions:
To make the pepitas: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with foil.  In a small mixing bowl, combine the pepitas with the oil and honey. Once they are well-coated, add the spices and salt and stir to blend.  Spread the pepitas on the foil-lined baking sheet and roast them in the preheated oven until they begin to brown and are very aromatic, about 5 minutes.  Set aside.
To make the dressing: In a small mixing bowl, combine the lime juice with the chiptoles, honey, cumin, and salt.  Gradually whisk in the oil and set aside.
For the salad: In a large mixing or serving bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the cheese.  Just before serving, add the cheese, spiced pepitas and the dressing.  Toss to combine.
