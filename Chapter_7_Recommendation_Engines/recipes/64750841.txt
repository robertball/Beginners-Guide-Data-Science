Ingredients:
Large seedless watermelon
750 mL bottle white tequila
750 mL orange liquor
fresh squeezed lime juice,  as needed

Directions:
Wash the outside of your watermelon and place it on a plate so that it doesn't roll. (You may need to slice off some of the rind to make a flat spot.)
Trace lids from tequila and orange liquor bottles on either side of melon. Then cut out with a sharp knife.
Insert bottles into melon and do not disturb for 48 hours.
Remove bottles, cut into slices, and drizzle with lime juice, as desired.
