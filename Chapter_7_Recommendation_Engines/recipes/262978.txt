Ingredients:
2 cups mashed potatoes
1 egg
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs, or as needed
1 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Combine mashed potatoes, egg, and pepper in a bowl and mix well together.
Pour bread crumbs into a small bowl. Shape potato mixture into 3-inch patties with wet hands and dip in bread crumbs so they are evenly coated.
Heat oil and butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook potato cakes on both sides until they are heated through and browned, about 4 minutes per side.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for leftover mashed potatoes. I never liked reheated mashed potatoes, but if you fry them in a pan as a potato pancake, they taste delicious. You might need to adjust the ingredients depending on how much mashed potatoes you have left over.
