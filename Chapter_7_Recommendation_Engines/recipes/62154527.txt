Description: 
Easiest quiche ever.
I like to add steamed broccoli on top of the quiche once it is done; gives it a little extra flavor without having to add broccoli into the mix. My boyfriend isn't a vegie person but will eat a little bit of broccoli only if it's steamed, so putting it on top makes us both happy and actually adds a nice texture balance.
