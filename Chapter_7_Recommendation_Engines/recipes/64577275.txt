Real Hot Chocolate Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk or half & half
2 cups semisweet or dark chocolate chips
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 to 3 tablespoons whipped cream (garnish - optional)
1 teaspoon chocolate flakes (garnish - optional)

Directions:
Add milk to a medium saucepan and over medium heat warm it until almost boiling.
Reduce heat to medium-low and add all the other ingredients, the chocolate chips last.  Stir constantly for even heating until the chocolate melts and combines, which should be in 5 to 10 minutes. Remember that chocolate can be temperamental so be careful not to use more heat than required to melt it.  Excess or uneven heating may cause the chocolate to become grainy or impart an undesirable "burned" flavor to it.
Pour into 8 ounce mugs to serve.  Garnish with whipped cream and/or chocolate flakes if desired.
Milk chocolate chips can be substituted in which case the sugar should be omitted.
