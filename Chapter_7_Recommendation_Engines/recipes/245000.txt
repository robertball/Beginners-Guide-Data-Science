Ingredients:
Cake:
2 eggs, separated
1/2 cup white sugar, divided
1/4 cup milk
1 dash vanilla extract
1/2 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
Tres Leches:
1 (6 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 dash vanilla extract, or to taste
Frosting:
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup cold heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat eggs and 1/3 cup white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until pale and fluffy; mix in milk and 1 dash vanilla extract. Whisk cake flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture.
Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar to egg whites mixture and beat until mixture is glossy and firm. Fold egg whites mixture into flour mixture until batter is just mixed. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly.
Mix evaporated milk, 1/2 cup cream, sweetened condensed milk, and 1 dash vanilla extract together in a bowl. Prick holes into the cupcakes and spoon 4 to 5 spoonfuls milk mixture over each cupcake.
Beat cream cheese, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Add 1/4 cup cold cream and beat until stiff peaks form. Spread frosting onto each cupcake.
