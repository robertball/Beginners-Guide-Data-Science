Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl combine eggs with 1/4 cup sugar and beat until thick and lemon-colored. Add the oil.  Combine separately 1-1/2 cups of the flour, the baking powder and the salt.  Gradually add this to the egg mixture and beat well.
Turn dough out onto a floured board (use remaining 1/2 cup flour) and knead thoroughly until dough is smooth.
Shape dough into sixteen balls.  Roll each one into a circle about 5 inches in diameter.  Let stand uncovered on waxed paper for about 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep fry pan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry circles until golden brown, turning once.  Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Store airtight.
