Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
3/4 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, butter, sugar and salt. Stir in enough flour to form a stiff dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down. Divide in half. Press each into a greased 9-in. pie plate.
In a small bowl, combine melted butter and seasonings; brush over dough. Sprinkle with cheese. Prick dough several times with a fork. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Store in the refrigerator.

I work full-time and don't get to spend as much time in the kitchen as I'd like. So I often make an entire meal from scratch on Sunday. This tantalizing bread is usually on the menu.
