Ingredients:
8 cups water
6 potatoes, cubed
1 yellow onion
1 tablespoon butter
1 bay leaf
2 teaspoons dried parsley
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup half-and-half cream

Directions:
Quarter the onion and separate the layers.
Boil 8 cups water with the potato, onion, butter, bay leaf, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
When the potatoes are done, mix the flour, eggs, and about 1 teaspoon salt in a separate bowl. Add water until it is a thick dough.
Spoon or cut noodles into soup--I tilt the bowl over the soup and use a butter knife to cut strips as it pours.
After noodles are fluffy, pour in the cream. Heat and serve. This soup is even better the next day!

Description: 
My oma used to make this soup when they first came to Canada and had no money--it's been passed down to me, and it's a favourite of everyone I've made it for!
