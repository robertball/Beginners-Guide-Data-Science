Spinach Canederli Recipe

Ingredients:
3/4 pound day old white bread, diced.
2/3 cup (150 ml) warm milk
1 1/3 pounds (600 g) fresh spinach
1 sweet onion (large Spanish or Vidalia work well)
3 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic
2 small eggs
4 tablespoons flour
Salt
Ground black pepper

Directions:
Finely chop the bread and put it in a bowl.
Stir in the milk and then let the mixture rest covered.
In the meantime, wash the spinach well. Remove the roots and coarse stalks.
Then, heat the spinach in a pot with just the water remaining on the leaves until it wilts, then drain it, squeeze it dry, and mince it.
Peel and finely dice the onion. Melt the butter and saut√© the onion until it is translucent. Crush and add the garlic, then the spinach, and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes to drive off excess moisture.
Remove the spinach mixture from the heat and let cool.
When the spinach mixture is room temperature, lightly whisk the eggs and incorporate them, together into the bread, and salt and pepper to taste.  Let the mixture sit for a half hour longer.
Set a pot of lightly salted water to boil.
While the water is boiling, wet your hands and shape the mixture into 8-10 canederli. They should look like small 3-4 inch logs, or round patty shaped.  Then lightly dredge them in flour.
Next, gently place them in the boiling water and simmer them until they float.   Then remove them from the water into a serving bowl/platter with a little melted butter, flakes of Parmigiano, and, if you like, freshly diced ripe tomatoes.
