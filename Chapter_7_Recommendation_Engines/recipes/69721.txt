Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup water
1 egg, beaten
4 slices day-old bread, torn into small pieces
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons seasoning salt
1/2 cup ketchup
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
6 slices lemon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish or a dish of similar size.
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, lemon juice, water, egg, bread, onion and seasoning salt until well blended. Shape into 6 individual loaves - I like to make large balls. Place them in the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven while you prepare the topping. In a small bowl, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard powder, allspice and cloves. Spoon the sauce over the loaves, then top each one with a slice of lemon. Return to the oven, and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until cooked through.
