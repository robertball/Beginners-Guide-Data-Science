Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup honey
1 cup chopped pitted dates
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 oranges, zested and juiced
3 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and shredded
1 cup chopped seedless green grapes
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups, or line with papers.
Mix the water, honey, dates, and baking soda together in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the dates are soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. When cool, pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, and combine with orange juice and zest, shredded apples, grapes, cinnamon, and walnuts; stir to combine. Mix in the flour, and spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake until set and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
These amazing muffins have no eggs, yeast, or white sugar in them and are pretty low fat. They are very moist and I always get compliments whenever I make them. Plus they make an awesome breakfast! Can be served with cottage cheese mixed with honey.
