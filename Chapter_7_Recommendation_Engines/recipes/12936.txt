Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 1/4 cups sliced carrots
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups chicken broth
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 (16 ounce) package frozen shoepeg corn
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot.  Add onion, carrot, and garlic; saute 5 minutes.  Stir in broth, sugar, corn, beans, tomatoes, and chilies; bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours.
This soup can also be prepared in a crock pot.  Combine everything in the pot, and cook on HIGH for the first hour.  Turn the temperature down to LOW, and cook 7 more hours.

Description: 
Simple to prepare! Throw it in your crock pot in the morning, and it will be done when you get home from work!  I use fat-free, low-sodium chicken broth, and no-salt-added diced tomatoes.
