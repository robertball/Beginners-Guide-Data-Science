Description: 
The original recipe (also from this site Skillet Pork Chops with Potatoes and Onions) was to be prepared entirely on the skillet.  I wanted to finish off in the oven for tenderness.  Pork chops and potatoes cook up perfectly! I also switched to a beef broth rather than bouillon, water and lemon.Modified from: Skillet Pork Chops with Potatoes and Onion
