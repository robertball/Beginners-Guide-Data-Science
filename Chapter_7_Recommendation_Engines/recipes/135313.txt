Ingredients:
1/2 pound frozen whole okra
1 serrano pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Fill a large pot with water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the frozen okra and return to a boil. Cook the okra uncovered, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, but do not rinse. Trim the stems off the okra.
Place the trimmed okra, chile pepper, garlic, lemon juice, and salt into a food processor. Process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Season to taste.

Description: 
This is a very typical dish found throughout West Africa, and accompanies rice and peanut sauce, among other dishes. It looks extremely unappealing, as the correct consistency is that of green slime, but the taste grows on you. Use a small amount (1/4 cup) to mix with a serving of rice and peanut sauce.
