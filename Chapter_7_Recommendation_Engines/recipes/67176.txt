2 cups cranberries
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 eggs, beaten

1/2 cup margarine, melted
1/4 cup shortening, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 9 inch glass pie plate.
Spread cranberries over the bottom of the buttered pie plate. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of  sugar and pecans over the berries. In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs and remaining sugar until well blended. Stir in flour, margarine and shortening, beating well after each addition. Pour over the cranberries.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the filling is set, and the top is lightly browned.

Description: 
A wonderful pie!  The tartness of the cranberries evens out with the sweetness of the sugar! This also makes a beautiful presentation!  Good for Thanksgiving and Christmas, along with any other time of the year because it is so simple to make!
