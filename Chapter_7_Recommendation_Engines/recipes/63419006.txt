Ingredients:
8 ounces flour
8 ounces water
2 leaves organic red cabbage

Directions:
1. In a quart measuring cup or other container, put in equal weights of flour and water, about 8 or 10 ounces of each.  Stir it and and put a leaf or two of organic red cabbage. Carri covers it, I leave mine open hoping to lure more unsuspecting gas producing microflora.
2. Let it sit overnight, then add another addition of flour and water, same amounts as before.  You should have an active starter after another night.  Carri recommends 12 hours between feedings.  Also, if conditions are too hot or too cold, this may affect your starter.  If you don't have a bubbly starter after 48 hours, give it another day
