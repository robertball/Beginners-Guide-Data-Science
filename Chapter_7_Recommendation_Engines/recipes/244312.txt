Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 (2 inch) piece fresh turmeric root, peeled and grated
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/3 cup water, divided

Directions:
Combine coconut oil, turmeric root, ginger root, and black pepper in a saucepan; add 1/2 of the water. Cook and stir mixture over medium until small bubbles form around the edges, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring continually and adding small amounts of the remaining water, until mixture forms a paste, 5 to 8 minutes.
Transfer paste to a glass container and cool to room temperature. Cover container tightly with a lid and refrigerate.

Description: 
This homemade paste made of fresh turmeric root, ginger, coconut oil, and pepper comes together quickly. Use it fresh in soups, sautes, and even on sandwiches. Add to any dish where you want some added flavor! Or use it as a base for curry pastes. It can be refrigerated to be used within 3 days or frozen in ice trays to be used later. I hope you enjoy it.
