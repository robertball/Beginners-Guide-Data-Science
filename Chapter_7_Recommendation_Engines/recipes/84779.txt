Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
6 pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1 cup beef consomme
1/2 cup water
1 onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the flour in a shallow dish. Season pork chops with salt and pepper, and press in the flour to lightly coat. Place chops in the skillet, and lightly brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
In a large baking dish, mix the rice, consomme, and water. Arrange onion slices over the rice. Top with pork chops.
Bake in the preheated oven 1 1/2 hours, or until rice is tender and pork is done.
