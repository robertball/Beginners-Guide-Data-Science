Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) package butterscotch chips
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes)
2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 32 squares)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large microwave-safe bowl, heat the chips and butter on high for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until chips are melted, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth.  Add the cracker crumbs; set aside 2/3 cup.  Press the remaining crumb mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan.
In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth.  Add the milk, egg and vanilla; mix well.  Stir in pecans.  Pour over the crust.  Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.  Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack.  Store in the refrigerator.
