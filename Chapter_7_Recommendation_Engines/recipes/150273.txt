Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper, to taste
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons pimentos, chopped
1 teaspoon grated onion
jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 slices bread (your choice)
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced

Directions:
Place bacon into a skillet over medium heat, and cook until crisp. Remove, and drain on paper towels.
Place the cream cheese in a bowl, and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, garlic powder, pimentos, onion, jalapeno, and cayenne pepper until well blended.
Spread two bread slices with the cream cheese mixture. Top each slice with avocado and bacon, divided evenly. Top with two remaining bread slices to make a sandwich. Cut each sandwich in half to serve.

Description: 
After tasting this sandwich in a tiny 'lunch-only' restaurant in my hometown (population 903), I had to try to imitate it. My husband loves this sandwich!
