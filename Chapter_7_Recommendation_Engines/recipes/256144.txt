Ingredients:
6 English muffins, split in half
PAM® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray
1/2 pound Odom's Tennessee Pride® Mild Country Sausage, thawed if frozen
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped fresh button mushrooms
8 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat broiler. Place English muffin halves on baking sheet; set aside. Spray large skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium-high heat. Add sausage, onion, bell pepper and mushrooms; cook 5 minutes or until sausage is crumbled and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Drain. Remove from skillet and keep warm.
Reduce heat to medium. Add eggs to same skillet; sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Cook without stirring until edges and bottom begin to set. Gently turn to scramble; continue cooking until set.
Broil English muffin halves 2 minutes or until toasted. Top halves evenly with sausage mixture, scrambled eggs and cheese. Broil 3 minutes more or until cheese melts. Serve immediately.
