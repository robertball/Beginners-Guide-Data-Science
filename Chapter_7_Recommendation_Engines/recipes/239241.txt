Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons coconut milk
3 tablespoons honey
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup sifted coconut flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease or line muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk eggs, butter, coconut milk, honey, salt, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Mix coconut flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
