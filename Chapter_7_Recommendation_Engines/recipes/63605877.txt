Ingredients:
1 lb elk ground
.5 pounds ground beef
2 red onions, chopped
4 Anaheim green chiles, chopped with seeds
2 Serrano chilies, chopped with seeds
.5 pound of bacon, chopped raw
3 small cans of V8
1 big can of crushed tomatoes (30 oz)
3 cans of diced tomatoes and green chilies 15oz
2 cans navy beans
2 cans pinto beans
12oz of dark beer

Directions:
Brown elk and beef, drain and set aside.  Brown chopped bacon, set aside once crisp (or however you like it), in drippings cook onions until transparent, then add chilies and cook until "awake" (smells like chile).
Add all cooked and canned to big soup pot and simmer for 2 hours or so.  I added salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic to taste. I left the pot uncovered, so it reduced a little bit over the hours of cooking.
It freezes well in ziplock bags, so I bagged about 8 cups for future.

Description: 
I throw this together one day and it turned out great - very much like Wendy's chili.  Great way to use that ground elk with NO gamey taste
