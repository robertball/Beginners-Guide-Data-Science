Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package tri-color rotini pasta
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons hot water
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 large tomato, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup finely diced sweet onion
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse with cold water to cool.
Whisk sugar, salt, and hot water in a large salad bowl until sugar has dissolved. Stir vinegar, vegetable oil,  and oregano into sugar mixture to make a dressing. Mix tomato, red bell pepper, and onion in the dressing. Gently fold rotini into dressing and vegetables, mix in Cheddar cheese, and season with black pepper.

Description: 
A small drive-in dairy bar in our town which has been closed for some time used to make this...my kids missed it. I remembered they had the ingredients posted to a board in the drive-in for some reason, so I worked on trying to get it the way they prepared it. It's finally right and I thought I would share it. We like this at room temperature, but it certainly can be refrigerated.
