Ingredients:
1 pound sliced bacon
1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese, room temperature
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup strawberry preserves

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix bacon, Cheddar cheese, green onions and mayonnaise. Adjust the amount of mayonnaise as needed, using just enough to make the mixture stick together.
Mold the mixture into a ball. Spread ball with strawberry preserves. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.
