Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO)
2 large onions, chopped
8 garlic cloves, minced
2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and chopped
1 tablespoon coriander
1/2 tablespoon cumin
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 16-ounce jar good quality roasted tomatillo salsa (such as Desert Pepper Trading Company or Frontera brand)
2 quarts chicken stock
1 28-ounce can hominy, drained and rinsed
1 13.5-ounce bag of yellow or white corn tortilla chips
1 store-bought rotisserie chicken, skin removed, meat removed from the bones and chopped
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
Juice of 2 limes
3/4 cup sour cream, for garnish
1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Place a large pot over medium heat, add EVOO.
Add the onions, garlic and jalapeño, and season with coriander, cumin, salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Cook until softened, about 8-10 minutes.
Add the tomatillo salsa, chicken stock and hominy to the pot and bring to a bubble.
While the mixture is coming to a bubble, place the tortilla chips (reserving a handful for garnish) in a food processor and pulse to grind, or in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin or empty wine bottle. You should have about 2 cups of ground chips. Add the ground chips to the mixture and cook for 10 minutes.
When ready to serve, add the chopped chicken to the pot along with 1/2 to 3/4 cup of cilantro and the lime juice, and cook 2-3 more minutes, until the chicken is heated through.
To serve, ladle the tortilla chicken stew into a bowl and garnish with some of the reserved tortilla chips, a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese.
