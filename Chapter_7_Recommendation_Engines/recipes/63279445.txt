Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes, unpeeled
5 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 cups half and half
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Place the potatoes and 1 tablespoon of salt in a 4-quartsaucepan with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer covered for 25 to 35 minutes, until the potatoes are completely tender. Drain.
In a small saucepan, heat the half-and-half and butter.
Put the potatoes into a large bowl and mix them for a few seconds on low speed with a hand mixer to break them up.
Slowly add 3/4 of the hot cream and butter mixture to the potatoes, mixing on the lowest speed (the last quarter of the cream and butter should be folded in by hand). Fold in the sour cream and remaining salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

I started making these for Thanksgiving one year and we loved them so much, they've made their way into our meals at least a dozen times a year!
