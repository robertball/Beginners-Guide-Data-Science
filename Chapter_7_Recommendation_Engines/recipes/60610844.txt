Ingredients:
1 pound dry ziti pasta
2 (24 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
1 (16 ounce) package large Italian sausages
1 (16 ounce) package of shredded Italian cheese blend (mozzarella, provolone, parmesan)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain. Slice sausages into small chunks.
In a large skillet, brown Italian sausages over medium heat. Add spaghetti sauce, and simmer 15 minutes. Add cooked ziti to the sauce. Stir to combine.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer as follows: 1/2 of the ziti mixture into the dish, top with half of the shredded cheese. Cover with remaining ziti and top with the remaining cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheeses are melted.

Description: 
I revised this recipe to make it easier and simpler to make.  Use jars of pasta sauce that have onions and garlic already in the sauce.  Pick up a bag of Italian cheese blend that has provolone, mozzarella, and Parmesan already shredded together eliminating the need to purchase 3 kinds of cheese.  I used large Italian sausage links and cut them into chunks creating little mini meatballs.  These recipe cost me less than $10.00 to make.Modified from: Baked Ziti I
