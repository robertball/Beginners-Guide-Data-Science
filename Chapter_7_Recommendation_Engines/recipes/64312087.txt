Ingredients:
1 garlic clove, minced
2 teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon olive oil
juice of 1/2 lemon
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
lemon wedges for garnish

Directions:
In a bowl combine all ingredients except the chicken.
Place chicken breasts between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until they are a uniform thickness. This ensures that they will cook evenly.
Place chicken in a glass dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken. Turn the chicken to coat. Marinate for 2 hours.
After two hours, remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the remaining marinade.
Cook the chicken in a skillet 3-4 minutes on each side or until cooked through. Serve with lemon wedges
Enjoy!
