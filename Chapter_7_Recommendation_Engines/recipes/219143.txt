Ingredients:
All-purpose flour
1 sheet Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry, thawed
6 ounces kielbasa, diced
2 tablespoons orange marmalade or your favorite jam
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
Chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Sprinkle the flour on the work surface.  Unfold the pastry sheet on the work surface.  Roll the pastry sheet into a 10x15-inch rectangle.  Cut the pastry sheet into 24 (2 1/2-inch) squares.  Press the pastry squares into 24 (1 3/4-inch) mini muffin-pan cups.
Stir the kielbasa, marmalade and mustard in a medium bowl.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon kielbasa mixture into each pastry cup.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown.  Sprinkle the pastries with the parsley before serving.
