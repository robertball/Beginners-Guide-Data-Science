Description: 
Here is a recipe that uses only fundamental ingredients.  Every other recipe I have found for Taco Seasoning has Chili Powder in it, which is a mix itself that has many of the same ingredients as Taco Seasoning, but in different proportions.  This recipe takes Chili Powder out but puts its ingredients and proportions back in.  Now you have full knowledge and control of all of the ingredients.  Adjust the red pepper to your heat preference.
