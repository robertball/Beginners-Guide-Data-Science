Ingredients:
* 1 whole fryer chicken, 2 to 3 1/2 pounds
* salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 2 Tablespoons Dijon mustard
* 1 Tablespoon celery seed
* 6 ribs celery, diced
* 1 sweet red onion, diced
* 1 small bunch fresh flat leaf, parsley finely chopped
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* hamburger buns

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees f. Rub the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Place the chicken in a shallow roasting pan and roast until cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. Test for doneness by twisting the drumstick, as it will release at the joint when done. Pour off any accumulated pan juices and reserve. Place the chicken and the reserved pan juices in the refrigerator to chill.
When the chicken is completely chilled, remove the meat from the bones and place in a mixing bowl. Melt the reserved juices in the microwave, then pour over the chicken and toss so that all of the juices can be re-absorbed.
Add the lemon juice and Dijon mustard and toss again to coat the meat. Add the celery seed, celery, onion, and parsley. Toss with just enough mayonnaise to moisten the salad. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve as a chicken salad sandwich.
