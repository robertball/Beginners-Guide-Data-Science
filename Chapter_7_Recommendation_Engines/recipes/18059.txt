Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine rice and seasoning packages, water, soup, sour cream, crushed garlic, minced garlic and broccoli. Mix well.

Description: 
Chicken leg quarters baked with rice in a creamy broccoli mixture. I dislike most convenience food recipes, but I feel that this one's a winner, as it's not only fast but healthy too!
