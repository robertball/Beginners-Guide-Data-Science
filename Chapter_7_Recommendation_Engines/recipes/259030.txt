Ingredients:
3 eggs, at room temperature
3 slices bacon
2 bunches kale
1/4 cup balsamic vinaigrette dressing, or more to taste
1/3 cup halved Muscat grapes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup toasted pumpkin seeds
2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add eggs. Remove from heat; let stand for 15 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool, about 5 minutes. Drain and chop.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-low heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Blot with paper towels to remove grease. Chop into small pieces.
Remove thick stems from kale. Chop leaves into thin, ribbon-like pieces. Place in a large bowl, pour in balsamic vinaigrette, and toss until evenly coated. Add eggs, bacon, Muscat grapes, parsley, salt, and pepper; toss well. Add 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds and Parmesan cheese; toss well.
