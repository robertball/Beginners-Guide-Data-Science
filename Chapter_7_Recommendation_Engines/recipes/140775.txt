Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups rolled oats
3/4 cup golden flax seeds
2/3 cup brewers' yeast
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup brown rice flour
2 cups oat flour
2 tablespoons organic raw sugar
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.
Combine oats, flax seeds, brewer's yeast, cheese, rice flour, oat bran flour and sugar in a large bowl.  Whisk together chicken broth and eggs; mix with oat mixture to make a fairly stiff dough.
Roll dough into 1 inch balls, then flatten into discs. (Or, roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/4 or 3/8 inch thick and cut into 1-inch x 1 1/2-inch rectangles.)  Place on cookie sheets 3/4 inch apart.
Bake until dry and the edges turn a light golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.  Cool before serving.

Description: 
We had an Aussie Mix with terrible skin allergies. They were so bad that we had to put her on shots. Finally, a groomer in Austin, Texas suggested eliminating corn from my dog's diet. Since we have had difficulty finding corn-free treats,  I developed this recipe. Both our dogs love them!
