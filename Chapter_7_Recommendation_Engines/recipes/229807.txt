Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons grated onion
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups sour cream
8 ounces coarsely shredded Swiss cheese
2 cups corn flakes, crushed
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add green beans, cover, and steam until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir 2 tablespoons butter, flour, onion, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan over medium heat; gradually stir in sour cream. Cook and stir mixture until hot, thickened, and smooth, about 10 minutes. Add steamed green beans to the cream mixture. Pour green bean-cream mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish; sprinkle with Swiss cheese.
Mix corn flakes and 2 tablespoons butter in a bowl until well coated; sprinkle over Swiss cheese layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and topping is browned, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
When I make this special-occasion veggie dish, I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe. Fresh steamed green beans provide a contrast to decadent melted Swiss cheese and crunchy topping. A family holiday favorite throughout my extended family. You can prepare ahead of time, leaving 4 to 5 minutes to steam the green beans and add other ingredients. Put into oven right before serving dinner (we usually put it in while carving the turkey).
