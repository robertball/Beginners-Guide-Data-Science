Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 pound seedless grapes

Directions:
Combine sugar and water in a saucepan; simmer over medium heat until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir Chinese five-spice powder into sugar mixture.
Pierce each grape all the way through using a fork. Add grapes and sugar mixture to a resealable bag; refrigerate, turning every few hours, until grapes are marinated, about 24 hours.
