Ingredients:
3 tablespoons peanut oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 lbs. boneless pork chops, diced into bite size pieces
1 cup cooked rice, preferably several days old, the drier the better
1 teaspoon fish sauce
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 green onion, chopped
1/2 small white onion, chopped
3 or 4 dried Thai chili peppers
10 grape tomatoes, sliced
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1 cup mung bean sprouts
1 egg, beaten
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 lime

Directions:
Important:  Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready next to the stove, as you will be working very quickly.
Heat a wok over high heat until extremely hot.
Add peanut oil and minced garlic, immediately followed by diced pork.  Stir constantly to keep garlic from burning.  Keep stirring until pork is cooked, about five minutes.  (Check to ensure pork is no longer pink in the middle before proceeding.)
Add rice and stir.
Stir in soy sauce and fish sauce. Keep stirring for about 30 seconds or so.
Add white onion, tomato, cilantro, chili peppers and bean sprouts, and keep stirring.
Push the entire mixture up the sides, leaving a bare spot in the middle.  Pour in the beaten egg, and scramble until cooked.  Once it's cooked, stir everything in the wok together to distribute the scrambled egg.
Sprinkle the green onions and white pepper on top.  Stir to combine, then turn off the heat.
Squeeze lime juice over the mixture.  Stir to combine, and serve.
NOTE:  I recommend removing the dried chili peppers, as they are EXTREMELY hot if eaten.
