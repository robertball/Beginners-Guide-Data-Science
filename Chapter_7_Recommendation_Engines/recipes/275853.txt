Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg white, beaten until frothy
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
Sauce:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated skim milk
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Combine pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Fold in egg white carefully, using a rubber spatula. Fold in whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup at a time, and mix until a soft dough forms. Mix in the all-purpose flour until incorporated into the dough. Make sure you don't overmix or gnocchi will be tough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into several 1-inch wide "snakes." Cut each snake into 1-inch pieces.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, about 3 minutes.
While gnocchi are cooking, combine evaporated milk and Parmesan cheese in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently with a wire whisk to prevent cheese from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Simmer until sauce reduces slightly, about 3 minutes.
Drain gnocchi and spoon into shallow bowls. Top with sauce and garnish with chopped parsley.
