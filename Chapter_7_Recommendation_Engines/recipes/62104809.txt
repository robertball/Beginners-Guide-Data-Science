Description: 
This is an Irish way to deal with the leftover Corned Beef after the American Corned Beef and Cabbage feast. My Husband considers this a Wonderful Part of the Corned Beef cycle. I use red potatoes with skins on, substitute Ham for the corned beef, and Leeks for the green onions. Depends on what's in the fridge.
