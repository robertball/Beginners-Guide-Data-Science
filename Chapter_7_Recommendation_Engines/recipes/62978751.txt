Ingredients:
2 8oz cream cheese (don’t use low fat on this recipe) at room temperature
1/3 c. Mayo (again, if you use light mayo, I will hunt you down and it won’t be pretty) Must be BEST FOODS!
½ c. grated parmesan
1 Tbsp of Oregano
2 teaspoons of garlic POWDER….must be powder!!
1 ½ c. chopped walnuts

Directions:
Mix all but walnuts (duh) together and taste.  You might want to add a little more garlic or oregano (or maybe not).  Roll into ball.  Put nuts on plate (that’s what he said) and roll ball in nuts.  Wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hrs. Taste best after 12 hrs in the fridge.
