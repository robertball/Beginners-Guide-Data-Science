Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 ½ cups long-grain brown rice
1 pound firm tofu
¼ cup unsweetened pineapple juice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons real maple syrup
2 tablespoons tamari
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
2 ¼ teaspoons arrowroot powder
2 ½ teaspoons grated fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1  onion, thinly sliced
1  carrots, sliced diagonally
4 ounces fresh green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths
1 large chopped red bell pepper
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
1  zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 cup pineapple chunks

Directions:
In a medium saucepan bring 2 cups of the water to a boil over high heat. Add the rice, reduce the heat, and simmer until the rice is tender and water is absorbed, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm.
Remove excess water from the tofu, and then cut it into 1/2-inch cubes.
In a small bowl, whisk the pineapple juice, lemon juice, ketchup, maple syrup, tamari, sesame oil, arrowroot, and ginger together.
In a wok or large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, carrot, green beans, bell pepper, mushrooms, and zucchini and stir-fry until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the pineapple juice mixture, tofu and pineapple. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Spoon the veggies and sauce over the brown rice and serve.
