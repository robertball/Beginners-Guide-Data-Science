Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons boiling water
12 ounces semisweet chocolate chunks
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Sift flour, cocoa, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl.
Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add brown sugar and beat until combined. Add molasses and beat until combined.
Dissolve baking soda in boiling water in a small bowl.
Beat half of the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Add baking soda mixture and beat until combined. Add remaining flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chunks.
Turn dough onto plastic wrap and pat out to about 1-inch thickness. Cover completely in plastic wrap and place dough in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
Roll chilled dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and place back in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Roll balls in sugar and place about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the surface of the cookies crack, 10 to 12 minutes.
