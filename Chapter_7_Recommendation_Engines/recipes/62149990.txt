Ingredients:
1 4 lb Flat Cut Corned Beef Brisket
1/4 cup French's yellow mustard
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 head of cabbage

Directions:
Put the brisket with the seasoning packet (comes in the package) into a dutch oven and cover with water. Make sure you include the juices from the package as well. Bring to a boil then simmer for 2 1/2 hours with the pot lid half on. Line a jelly roll pan with foil. Place brisket on foil, fat side UP. Add several ladles of corned beef broth onto the pan. (this is a what they call a "wet bath" for the brisket in the oven). Combine 1 part mustard and 3 parts brown sugar in a bowl. I used 1/4 cup of mustard and 3/4 cups of brown sugar. Dress the brisket with half of the glaze. Place brisket in pre-heated oven, 275, for 2 1/2 hours. Reglaze after the first hour and add more ladles of broth if pan goes dry. Before you pull the brisket out, turn up the temp to BROIL for about 2-4 minutes or so to caramelize the top of the brisket. Just don't let it burn, because it will with the sugar and all of the fat. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.  Quarter cabbage and simmer in the liquid you boiled the corned beef in.  About 30-60 mins till cabbage is tender.
