Description: 
The ham, cheddar and mushrooms are the perfect combination for this breakfast hit. This strata has been made by my family for five generations. My oldest son is now about to make it 6 generations. I will pass the baton to him on this holiday season.Modified from: 5TH GENERATION HAM & CHEDDAR STRAT
