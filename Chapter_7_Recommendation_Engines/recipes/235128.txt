Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 pound ground beef
1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato soup
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain macaroni and return to pot.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir tomato soup and tomato sauce into the beef; pour into pot with macaroni and stir. Transfer macaroni mixture to a 1.5-quart baking dish; top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Noodles in a mild tomato sauce with ground beef and cheese, an easy weeknight meal that's also great left over. I sometimes add frozen or thawed peas to sneak in some veggies. You can really use any kind of pasta.
