Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups butter (5 sticks)softened
1 1/4 cups icing sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon oil
2 1/2 tsps vanilla
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
1 cup cinnamon hearts, chopped finely, I use my mini chopper to pulse, you don't want a powder
5 to 5 1/4 cups all purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Beat butter in a large bowl using a hand mixer until fluffy.
Stir in icing sugar, cinnamon oil, vanilla, baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon hearts, using a wooden spoon or spatula.
Add flour 1 cup at a time until dough comes together, I use my hands as I find it easier to work with and you won't add too much flour.
Transfer dough to the jelly roll pan and using your hands push the dough into the corners then flattened until even.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until corners are just turning a light brown.
Cool on a rack for 10 minutes, lift out of pan using sides of parchment paper, cut into 2 inch squares.
Store in a Tupperware container at room temperature or freeze.
