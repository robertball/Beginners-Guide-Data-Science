Description: 
Hamia was my wife's 96 year old Korean Grandmother.  Her food was the essence of comfort and security. It bound our family and brought forth joy. When my wife and I started dating, whenever Hamia heard I was coming to the house she would make these wontons just for me. Her memory lives on in my love for her and in these recipes.
