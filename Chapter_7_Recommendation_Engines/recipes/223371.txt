Ingredients:
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 large eggplant, sliced into 1-inch thick rounds
1/4 teaspoon Asian fish sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon dried basil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Sprinkle garlic salt over both sides of eggplant slices; let sit for 30 minutes to release water.
Place eggplant slices in a large dish; drizzle with fish sauce. Add basil, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil; stir to evenly coat. Marinate for about 15 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove eggplant from marinade and arrange on preheated grill; cook until tender, occasionally basting with marinade, about 5 minutes per side.
