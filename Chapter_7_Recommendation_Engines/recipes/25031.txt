Ingredients:
1 cup corn syrup
3/4 cup peanut butter
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups quick-cooking oats
1 3/4 cups unsalted peanuts

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the corn syrup, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Continue to boil for 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, oats and peanuts. Turn onto a well greased 10x15 inch  jellyroll pan or any cookie sheet with 1 inch sides. When cool enough to touch, grease your hands and pat the mixture down flat in the pan.
Refrigerate overnight. Let stand for 20 minutes before cutting into squares.
