Ingredients:
1 cup of butter (do not change!)softened
1 cup of sugar
1/2 cup of almond meal/flour (minced very finely)
1 egg (slightly beaten)
1/2 tsp of almond extract
2 cups of flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Place desired cookie molds on cookie sheets and spray with non-stick baking spray; set aside.
Cream butter and sugar till light and fluffy.
Slightly beat the egg; add egg, almond, almond extract to butter mixture.
Add flour at at time to batter, fully blending each time, scraping down the sides.
Chill batter for at one hour to over night.
When ready, take some dough (accordingly to size of molds) make it into small rounds.
Press dough into molds-go slighly under the lip of molds as these will puff up.
Poke holes with fork into the dough to airate the cookies.
Bake 9-12 minutes depending on size of molds; the smaller they are, the faster the bake-the larger they are, the longer it takes. Do not overbake!!  They will be still white (not golden through out but edges can be slightly gold) and be done!!
Cool almost completely; and invert them upsidedown to eject them from molds.

Description: 
This is an old Eastern European recipe of these delicate but rich almond cookies that you use German, Swedish molds.  In my family, we make these at holiday times, nick-named Old Fashioned cookies, passed down from generation to generation.  I use antique cookie molds.  Depending the size of the cookie molds will also depend on your yield of cookies..
