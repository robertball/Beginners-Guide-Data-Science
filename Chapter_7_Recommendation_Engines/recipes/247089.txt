Ingredients:
1/2 vanilla bean
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons superfine sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Split vanilla bean lengthwise with the tip of a sharp knife. Holding the pod open, scrape seeds from each half using the flat side of the knife. Transfer seeds to a large bowl; discard pod.
Pour heavy cream over vanilla seeds. Add sugar and vanilla extract. Whip with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until serving.

Description: 
This is a sweeter version of whipped cream. It is smooth and satiny. My family loves it on pancakes, chocolate mousse, and just about anything that needs a sweet touch. Enjoy, from my family to yours.
