Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsifted all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 ounces (1 stick) melted butter
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 cups rice crispies
2 cups mini marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat the oven the 350Â°
Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt and set aside.
Beat together the butter, sugar, and vanilla, and then the eggs, one at a time.  Now stir in the sifted dry ingredients.
Spread smoothly in a greased 9x13 inch pan.  Bake for about 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
While baking, melt the peanut butter, chocolate chips in the microwave.  Stir in the rise crispies until mixed thoroughly. (hint: to make spreading easier, microwave again after mixing in the crispies)
Once the bottom is done, cover the top evenly with marshmallows.  Put it back in the oven for 2 more minutes.
Pour the chocolate mixture evenly over the marshmallows.  Let cool and harden before cutting into squares.
