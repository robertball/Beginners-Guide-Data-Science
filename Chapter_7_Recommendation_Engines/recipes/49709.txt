Description: 
This is an unusual kind of gravy with sliced wieners that is served over mashed potatoes. The first time I had this was at my sister-in-laws over twenty years ago. I've changed the ingredients just a bit, but since then it's been among our family's favorite. Now our daughter Jenny prepares it for her family.
