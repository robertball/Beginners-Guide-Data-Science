Ingredients:
Recipe adapted from South Your Mouth
1 pound chicken tenderloins
2 tablespoons Chicken Scratch, divided (recipe noted section)
Buttermilk (enough to cover tenders)
1/4 cup hot sauce
1 cup Domata Gluten Free flour
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
Vegetable oil

Directions:
Season chicken with 1 tablespoon Chicken Scratch; set aside.
Whisk buttermilk and hot sauce.  Place chicken n a shallow bowl; Cover with buttermilk mixture.  Refrigerate for 1 - 24 hours.
Combine remaining 1 tablespoon Chicken Scratch, flour, black pepper and dry mustard in a shallow bowl; set aside.
Roll chicken in flour mixture. Place chicken on a baking sheet or plate lined with wax paper and refrigerate until ready to use.  Allowing them to rest a few minutes will help the breading stick to the chicken tenders.
Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet until temperature reaches 335-340 degrees. Fry the chicken until golden brown and crispy, turning once (about 5 minutes) then drain on cooling rack or paper towels.

Description: 
Keith really liked this chicken. It is mildly spicy and the buttermilk soak makes it very tender.   I used Domata Gluten Free  for rolling chicken.
