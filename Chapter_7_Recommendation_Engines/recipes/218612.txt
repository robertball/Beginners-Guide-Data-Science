Ingredients:
Marinade:
3 cups Mexican lager (such as Negraâ„¢ Modelo)
3/4 cup coarsely chopped white onion
3/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup minced garlic
1 tablespoon hot salsa
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
4 pounds beef tenderloin, cut into 1-inch cubes, or more as needed
1 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups coarsely chopped red onion
2 green bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces
12 white mushrooms
12 cherry tomatoes
(12-inch) skewers, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes

Directions:
Combine lager, white onion, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salsa, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix together until marinade is well blended. Add beef carefully. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 6 hours to overnight.
Thread the marinated beef, pineapple chunks, red onion chunks, green bell pepper pieces, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes alternately through skewers. Place shish kebabs on a baking sheet or jelly roll pan.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill shish kebabs until beef is firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 minutes per side.
