Ingredients:
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 (20 ounce) cans crushed pineapple, drained with juice reserved
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 egg yolks
pastry for a (10 inch) double crust pie

Directions:
Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup of the reserved pineapple juice. Combine the drained pineapple, sugar, salt, egg yolks, cornstarch mixture, and 1 cup of the reserved pineapple juice in a large saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat just until the mixture has thickened slightly and turned shiny. Do not boil. Remove from heat, and cool 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Line a 10-inch pie plate with half of the pastry. Pour the cooled pineapple mixture into the crust. Top with second crust, and seal and crimp the edge. Use a fork to poke holes in the top crust in a few places.
Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool before serving.
