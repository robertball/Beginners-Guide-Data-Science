Ingredients:
2/3 cup ground pecans
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets.
Combine all ingredients in a skillet, stirring over medium heat until blended. Keep mixture warm. (Mixture will be thin).
Drop by teaspoonfuls about 3 inches apart on a well-greased cookie sheet.  (No more than four or six cookies per sheet). Bake for five minutes then cool on the cookie sheet for one minute.
Quickly remove each cookie with spatula and curl around handle of wooden spoon.  If cookies get too brittle to curl, return to oven for a minute to soften.  To keep crisp, store airtight.
