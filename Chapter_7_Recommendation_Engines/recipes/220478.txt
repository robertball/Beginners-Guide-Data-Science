Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans), thawed
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cubes shrimp bouillon
2 1/2 cups water
2 small limes, juiced
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
1/2 cup coconut milk
3/4 cup shredded coconut, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Spread thawed edamame in a roasting pan and drizzle with sesame oil and olive oil; sprinkle with sesame seeds, chili powder, garam masala, salt, and black pepper. Toss to combine and spread out evenly.
Roast edamame in the preheated oven until slightly browned in spots, about 20 minutes. Stir edamame after 10 minutes, then after 5 more minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
Place shrimp bouillon cubes, water, and lime juice in a large saucepan and bring to a boil.
Stir in jasmine rice, cover saucepan, and simmer over low heat until liquid has absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.
Remove from heat and stir in coconut milk, roasted edamame, and toasted coconut. Season to taste with salt and black pepper if desired.
