Ingredients:
1 cup almond butter
Â¾ cup coconut sugar
1 tablespoon molasses
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons cacao nibs
1/2 ounce good quality dark chocolate
Flake salt, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a large cookie sheet with parchment.
In a large bowl, beat together almond butter and coconut sugar with an electric mixer.
Add molasses, egg, vanilla, cocoa powder, sea salt and baking soda and continue beating for 30 seconds or until combined.
Mix in cacao nibs and drop, by spoonfuls, onto parchment-lined baking sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt dark chocolate and stir until smooth.
When cookies are removed from oven, allow to cool on baking sheet - they will be very crumbly while warm.
Drizzle each with a bit of chocolate and top with another sprinkle of cacao nibs and a pinch of flake salt.

Description: 
These grain-freen naturally sweetened cookies have it all - they're chewy, sweet-and-salty, and have a crunch from the raw cacao nibs.
