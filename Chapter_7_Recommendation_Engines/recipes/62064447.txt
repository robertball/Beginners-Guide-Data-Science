Description: 
This is one of my families favorite desserts. I have doubled the crumble part of it to make a layer on the bottom as well as on the top so that it can be cut up and served as squares. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't love this recipe. You can substitute any fruit for apples. A mixture of apple with pears or peaches is great, and for christmas you can make it with apples and cranberries. If using mixed berries, omit the lemon and spice mixture and just coat with a little sugar.
