Ingredients:
2 whole boneless chicken breasts, split
1/4 lb sliced deli ham
Cheddar cheese
4 strips raw bacon
2-3 c plain bread crumbs

Directions:
Lightly pound the chicken breast to about 1/4 inch thickness.  Top with 1-2 slices of deli ham and chunk of cheddar about 1/4 inch thick and less than the width of the chicken.  Roll up, tucking in sides as much as you can and wrap roll tightly with 1 strip of bacon.  Gently roll in milk and then bread crumbs.  Place in greased 9x13 pan.  Repeat for additional breasts.  Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.
