Ingredients:
Athenian Sauce:
1 large green bell pepper, diced
1 medium ripe tomato, diced
1 medium yellow onion, diced
4 ounces Greek extra-virgin olive oil
4 ounces pitted kalamata olives, sliced
2 ounces lemon juice
1 green onion, chopped
1 tablespoon capers
1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
Fish:
2 ounces Greek extra-virgin olive oil
4 (10 ounce) fillets red snapper
2 ounces Greek seasoning
1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, or as needed

Directions:
Combine green bell pepper, tomato, onion, olive oil, olives, lemon juice, green onion, capers, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper in a heavy pan over medium-high heat. Saute until all ingredients are slightly wilted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Heat olive oil in a heavy pan over medium heat. Add snapper fillets to hot oil. Sprinkle Greek seasoning on top and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn fish over and cook on the other side for 2 more minutes. Turn fish back to the original side and finish cooking until fish is tender and flakes easily with a fork, another 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour still-hot Athenian sauce over fish just before serving. Sprinkle about 2 ounces feta cheese and 1 tablespoon of parsley over each portion.
