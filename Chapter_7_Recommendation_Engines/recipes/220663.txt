Ingredients:
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
2 cloves garlic, chopped (optional)
1 (14 ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained

Directions:
Combine lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and garlic in a sealable plastic container.
Seal the container and shake to emulsify the mixture.
Remove the lid and add artichoke hearts. Reseal the lid and continue shaking the container until the artichoke hearts are completely coated.

Description: 
Store-bought marinated artichokes are too expensive and are consumed faster than the time it takes to open the jar. I created this recipe with simple ingredients that are already found in the kitchen. It's delicious by itself, but feel free to experiment and even make your own artichoke salad. It's not like the real deal...it's better! Enjoy immediately or chill the marinated artichokes for at least an hour before serving.
