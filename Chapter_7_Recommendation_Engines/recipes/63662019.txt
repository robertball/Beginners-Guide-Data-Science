Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups almond flour
3 T splenda
2 cups low-fat plain yogurt
2 egg whites, lightly beaten
1 T canola oil.

Directions:
Preheat a non-stick griddle to 375 degrees F (185 degrees C). Lightly grease the cooking surface with PAM
Sift  baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a mixing bowl. Mix the almond flour and splenda into the  mixture until just blended. Stir the yogurt, egg whites together in a separate bowl; add to the flour mixture, stirring only until just incorporated. If batter is too thick add some egg whites and stir.
Pour about 1/3 cup of the batter onto your preheated cooking surface, leaving space for the pancakes to expand. Cook until dry around the edges and bubbles have formed over the top, 2 to 3 minutes; turn and continue cooking until done in the middle and golden brown, another 1 to 2 minutes.
