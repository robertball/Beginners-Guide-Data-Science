Ingredients:
5 fresh lemons
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
40 drops stevia (or other sweetener, to taste)
3 cups crushed ice
1 cup cold water

Directions:
Squeeze juice from lemons into blender.
Add baking soda into blender and blend very briefly on lowest setting. Mixture will fizz and rise in blender.
Add stevia (or other sweetener) into blender along with crushed ice and cold water. Blend well until extremely smooth. Note: blending for too short a time will yield a 'rocky' smoothie with ice chips that are too big to fit through straws.
Mixture will be VERY thick. Add more cold water to taste for more liquidy slushes.
Pour into individual glasses and serve with straws immediately.

Description: 
When fresh lemons are growing aplenty or are on sale, stock up on them and make these refreshing fizzy slushes. The added baking soda takes the sting out of the lemons, making this an easy-to-drink cool beverage.
