1/2 cup sugar

Arrange the beets in a glass or ceramic bowl; pour the hot vinegar mixture over the beets. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours. Drain and serve.

Description: 
I'm told no good Dane or Swede considers a meal complete without these tangy treats. They add gorgeous color to any table. If you want to use fresh beets, peel and cook them. They can be served sliced or diced. Otherwise, just open a can like I do. Serve with slices of hard-boiled eggs.
