Ingredients:
(Per Steak)
5 cloves of garlic (diced or chopped fine)
1/4 t salt
1/4 t freshly ground black pepper
1/4 t white pepper
1/4 t red pepper flakes
1 T of salted butter

Directions:
Dry Age a full 14-16 lb “choice” Rib-eye slab (available at Costco).  Uncover the meat and place on a wire rack above a cookie sheet and put in the fridge for 21 days.  Maintain temp of 35-37 Deg F.  At 21 days a thin jerky like shell will cover the exterior of the meat.  Use a sharp knife to remove the thin 1/8”-1/4” shell and discard it.
Cut the rib-eye slab (against the grain) into 1 1/4" thick steaks.  One slab should make 12-13 steaks.  Trim any excess fat from the edge of steaks but leave a medium to thin layer along steaks edge for flavor.
Season first side of each steak evenly with 2 ½ minced garlic cloves, 1/8 t of salt, 1/8 t freshly ground black pepper, 1/8 t white pepper, and 1/8 t red pepper flakes. Lightly press the seasoning into the steak so the ingredients don't fall off while handling steak.  Equally season second side of steak.  Use any spilt seasoning to season the edges of the steak.
Pre-heat a large frying pan (aluminum is preferred) on the stove at high heat.  Add 1 T of butter.
Once the butter has melted and starts to slightly brown then quickly add the steak.  Let first side of the steak cook undisturbed for 2 minutes, then quickly turn the steak with tongs or spatula and let the second side cook for 2 minutes.  (Important: Only turn steak 1 time, do no not poke holes in the steak or you will lose its flavor, USE A TIMER for perfect cooking).  Quickly remove the pan from the open flame and cover the pan with a lid.  The steak will continue to cook in the covered pan; For medium rare let it sit for 1 minute.  For Medium let it sit two minutes.  This is for a 1 ¼” thick steak so if your steak is thinner or thicker than this then adjust this sitting time accordingly.  Remove from pan and let it stand for 2-3 min. Serve and enj
