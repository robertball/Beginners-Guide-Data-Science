Ingredients:
1/2 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste, divided
2 zucchini
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, zested, or to taste
1/2 cup fresh spinach (optional)
1/4 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon capers, drained

Directions:
Season shrimp lightly with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp; cook until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl.
Cut zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer fitted with the large shredding blade. Chop up into slightly shorter pieces.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini noodles, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook and stir until slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add lemon zest, spinach, and chicken broth. Cook until liquid reduces by 1/4, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and capers. Cook until shrimp is warmed through, about 1 minute more. Drizzle the remaining olive oil on top.

Description: 
We just love our zucchini pasta at home. I go every Sunday to our farmers market and stock up! Today I even had some leftover fresh spinach from the week and decided to add it in as well. You can omit, but if you have spinach or any other leftover veggies, go ahead and add them in! Enjoy.
