Ingredients:
1 lb chicken breast, cut into 1in cubes
1/3 lb broccoli florets
1/3 lb cauliflower florets
1/3 lb carrots diced
1/2 cup peas
1/2 cup green beans
1 can of cream of chicken soup
1 can of broccoli cheddar soup
1 pkg stove top stuffing
1 tblsp basil, divided
1 tblsp garlic powder, divided
1/2 tblsp rosemary, divided
1/4 tblsp chili powder, divided
1 tsp thyme
2 cups water
2 tblsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Put water and oil in a medium saucepan.  Add half of all spices, except thyme.  Add cubed chicken and all veggies.  Bring to a boil.
In a 9" x 16" baking dish, pour both cans of soups and remaining spices.  Mix thoroughly. Once the chicken is cooked all the way through, about ten minutes, scoop out all ingredients and add to baking dish, leaving the water in the sauce pan.  Mix stuffing into the water and put aside.
Mix all the ingredients in the baking dish and level out.  Once the stuffing is fully hydrated (about two minutes), add that to the top of the dish and spread evenly.
Place baking dish in the oven for about 25 minutes or until the stuffing is beginning to darken and is crispy.
Enjoy!
