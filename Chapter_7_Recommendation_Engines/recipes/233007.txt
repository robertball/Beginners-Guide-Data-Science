Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds ground pork
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
1 tablespoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoons fennel seed
2 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon anise seed
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Mix pork, maple syrup, sage, salt, fennel seed, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and anise seed in a large bowl until evenly blended. Shape pork into small patties.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry patties in batches until pork is browned and no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
Homemade breakfast sausage made with ground pork and seasonings. Great cooked in crumbles for biscuits and gravy, or in patties for breakfast sandwiches or eggs benedict. I like to premake a large batch and freeze the patties, then just take out a few the night before.
