Description: 
This is a spicy baked spagetti that resembles mexican food much more then italian.  I threw it together because I had to make dinner and this was the hodge-podge of ingredients I had lying around.  Both my 18 month old and 3 year old had seconds and my husband told me to write down the recipe.
