2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat brown sugar, white sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour and salt; mix well. Stir in apples and walnuts. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar.
