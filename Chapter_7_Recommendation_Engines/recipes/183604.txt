Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork (for a healthier lasagna, substitute beef for pork or turkey)
1 small onion, chopped
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste
1 (24 ounce) jar Newman's Own Marinara with Mushrooms Sauce
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Boil lasagna noodles per box directions.
Meanwhile, saute ground beef and/or pork until lightly browned; drain grease from pan. In separate pan, saute onion and garlic in olive oil; add carrots and celery.
When finished, combine meat, vegetables, and 1 jar of Newman's Own Marinara with Mushrooms Pasta Sauce (Newman's Own Garlic Red and Green Pepper is also terrific in this recipe either added or to be used rather than the Mushrooms sauce).
Line baking pan with one layer of noodles; spread meat and veggie mixture; add another layer of noodles and add ricotta cheese (you can also mix the ricotta with a jar of Newman's Own Bombalina sauce for a great twist); place last layer of noodles and spread a thin layer of meat, sauce, and veggie mix; top with grated parmesan cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.
