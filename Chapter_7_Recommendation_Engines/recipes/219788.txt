Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cups sliced peaches, drained and chopped
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup coconut milk
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
1 cup peach yogurt
5 tablespoons vanilla yogurt
5 fresh mint leaves

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook the peaches in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir the brown sugar and vegetable broth with the peaches; continue cooking until the sugar dissolves, 10 to 15 minutes; remove from heat and allow to cool.
Stir the coconut milk and chopped mint through the peach mixture.
Pour the soup into a blender, cover, and puree until smooth. Pour the pureed soup into a large bowl, stir the peach yogurt thoroughly into the soup, and refrigerate until completely chilled. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon vanilla yogurt and a fresh mint leaf to serve.
