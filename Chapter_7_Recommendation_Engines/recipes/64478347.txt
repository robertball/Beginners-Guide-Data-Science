Ingredients:
1 cup of chestnut flour
1 cup of milk or milk substitute
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
2 medium eggs
extra oil for the pan

Directions:
Add the 2 eggs, oil and milk (or milk substitute) to a medium bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined.
Sprinkle in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, mixing well each time making sure no lumps remain. The batter will be very liquid.
Whisk vigorously when all the flour has been added. Pour through a fine strainer to eliminate any lumps.
Heat an 8-inch crepe pan over med-high heat. When hot, pour a scant 1/4 cup of the batter onto the pan and swirl it around to cover the entire surface. Heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges have browned and are loosened easily by a thin spatula.
Flip the crepe and cook another 2 minutes until cooked completely. Remove from the pan onto a plate and continue with the rest of the batter.
Serve or use immediately or allow to cool and refrigerate until needed. Cooked crepes will stay fresh in the fridge for 2 days. the batter can be refrigerated up to 24 hours.

Description: 
Chestnut flour makes very unique crepes that happen to be both gluten and wheat free. The smoky, nutty flavour of the chestnut flour compliments both savoury and sweet fillings. Try them stuffed with warm gorgonzola and walnuts of with vanilla ice cream and roasted hazelnuts! Delicious!
