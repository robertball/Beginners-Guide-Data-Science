Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh or frozen cranberries
1 1/4 cups sugar, divided
3 cups all-purpose flour
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup milk
1 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel

Directions:
In a bowl, toss cranberries with 1/4 cup sugar; set aside. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and remaining sugar. Cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine eggs and milk; stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Fold in pecans, lemon peel and cranberries. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until muffins test done.

When you want a little something extra for breakfast, serve these muffins - you'll get requests for seconds. I store them in the freezer and reheat them when we want them. -Suzanne McKinley, Lyons, Georgia
