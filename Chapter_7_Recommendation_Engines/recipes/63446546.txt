Ingredients:
3 3oz packages of ramen style beef or chicken flavored noodles with seasoning packets
Enough boiling water to just cover the ramen (too much boiling water will turn this into soup).
1 4oz or less for desired heat, can diced jalapenos, drained (Not pickled)
2 cups (divided use) sharp cheddar cheese (such as Sargento's Off The Block Shredded Extra Sharp Cheddar®) or Mexican blend (such as Sargento's Reduced Fat Shredded 4 Cheese Mexican Blend®)
3 oz of a non vinegar based hot sauce (such as Pico Pica®, Cholula® or Tapatio®)
1 cup mayonnaise
1 12.5 oz can chicken breast, drained and separated
Saltine or snack crackers

Directions:
Before opening packages of ramen, break the noodles into small pieces.
Place broken ramen and seasoning packets into a mixing bowl. Pour just enough boiling water in the bowl to cover the ramen. Cover and let set for 5 minutes.
Uncover ramen and stir. While the ramen is still warm place 1 cup of the cheese, jalapenos, hot sauce, mayonnaise, and chicken into the bowl and mix all ingredients thoroughly.
Place in refrigerator for 1 hour or until chilled. (This can also be served warm).
Serve on saltine or snack crackers and garnish with remaining cheese.
