Ingredients:
1/4 tsp pepper
2 tbs sugar
1 cup Bisquick
1/4 cup grated cheese (or to taste)
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups zucchini/squash, grated and excess liquid squeezed out.
2 tbs oil

Directions:
Mix together the pepper, sugar, Bisquick and cheese in a bowl. If the zucchini is very wet you need to remove the excess liquid before adding it to the Bisquick mix. Place grated zucchini in a clean dish towel. Roll the zucchini up in the towel and over a bowl, squeeze out excess liquid from the zucchini. Mix in the eggs and the drained squash until all ingredients are incorporated. If the mixture is too dry, add zucchini liquid by the tablespoon until the batter is the consistency of a thick fritter batter.
Place the 2tbs of oil in a heated pan, heated to medium heat.  Drop mixture into the oil by the tablespoon full.  Brown on one side then turn over onto the other side, cook until browned.
Serve hot or at room temperature.  You may also serve these with some marinara sauce or sour cream or another favorite dip.  We just like them plain!

Description: 
These zucchini squash patties are a favorite of my families.  As Pennsylvanian backyard gardeners, we have an abundance of zucchini every year and coming up with new ways to use it has become a challenge!  This is my Mother's recipe and is requested by many family and friends once they have tasted them!
