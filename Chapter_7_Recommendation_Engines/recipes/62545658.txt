My Favorite Frosting Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine milk and flour.  Continually whisk the milk/flour mixture over low/med heat until it's really thick (but don't burn the bottom). It should be difficult to whisk by the time it's done. It must COOL COMPLETELY. (I usually do this step right after I put the cake in the oven).
(Note:  BUTTER PREFERRED (stick margarine may do (but butter tastes better) - NEVER use tub margarine-it'll never whip up and will turn out slimy). Butter must be ROOM TEMPERATURE (with a slight give when squeezed gently - leave out about 1 hour))
I use my Kitchenaid Mixer.  Beat the butter/sugar at least 4 min.
Add vanilla, beat 2 min.
Add 1/2 TOTALLY COOLED milk/flour paste, beat 4 min.
Add other 1/2 and beat 4 min. Makes enough to fill and frost 2 layer cake, about 3 1/2 cups.
