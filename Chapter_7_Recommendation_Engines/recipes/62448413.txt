Ingredients:
5 - 6 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons (.25 ounce)active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup honey or sugar
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon butter (to brush on top of the loaves)

Directions:
Add first 6 ingredients, in order shown, to the bowl of Kitchen Aid mixer, (keep yeast and salt on opposite sides of the bowl) and combine on #1 setting until all combined.  Increase speed to #2 setting until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.  Turn out onto floured surface and knead until a nice semi-smooth dough has formed; this may take an additional 1/2 to 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Or you can knead in the KA for 10 minutes, until smooth. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.  Cover,and let rise in a warm place until doubled.
Punch down, and divide into 2 loaves. Shape into oblong forms and place in greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans. Allow each to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes; do not overbake.  Remove from pans to cool on cooling rack. Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine when done to prevent crust from getting hard.
