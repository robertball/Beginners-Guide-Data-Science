Ingredients:
2 pounds chili meat or coarsely ground hamburger
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup beer
1 8oz. can tomato sauce
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium green pepper, chopped
5-6 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
4 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
4-5 fresh jalapeno peppers, chopped (remove seeds)
Cayenne pepper, to taste
1 or 2 cans of red kidney beans or pinto beans, drained.

Directions:
In a large skillet, brown the chili meat in 1/4 cup oil.  If you are using regular hamburger instead of chili meat, you should be able to brown it without any additional oil.
Transfer the meat to a large kettle, leaving the liquid in the skillet.  Add beer (or water) and tomato sauce to the meat, and bring it to a simmer over low heat.
Saute onion, green pepper and garlic in the remaining 1/4 cup oil and the liquid left in the skillet.  Add the remaining dry ingredients and chopped jalapenos.  Simmer for about 30 minutes, and then add it to the meat in the kettle.
Simmer for about 2 hours.  Dip off any grease that settles on top.  Add more beer or water as needed.  Add 1 or 2 cans of red kidney beans or pinto beans, or an equivalent amount of cooked, dry pinto beans, during the last 15 minutes of cooking, if desired.
