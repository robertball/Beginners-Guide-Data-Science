1-1/2 pound ground beef (or ground turkey works great, too)
2 links Linguisa (portuguese) sausage, cut into bite size chunks
3 cans Tomato soup, undiluted
2 cans red Kidney Beans (1 can drained, 1 can with liquid)
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced (or you can use 1 tbs garlic powder)
1 tbs salt
3 tbs black pepper
2 tbs cumin

Directions:
Pour into the crock pot (or large pot or dutch oven) the beans, the soup and the seasonings
In a large skillet brown the ground beef until done then add to the pot
In same skillet, using the ground beef drippings, saute the onion and garlic
Using a slotted spoon add the onions and garlic to the pot, reserving some of the fat
In the same skillet, brown the chunks of sausage.  Drain on a paper towel, add to the pot
Stir all ingredients together and set the crock pot for high (to eat in 2-3 hours) or on low (to eat in 4-5 hours).  Stir occasionally and season to taste, adding more salt or pepper or spice it up and add some tobacco or red pepper flakes.

Description: 
Growing up we called this Portuguese Beans.  But my man thinks it's chili so that's what I call it now.  Super easy, not spicy and inexpensive to make.  I make it in a crock pot but it can go into a large pot and cook on the stove.  We eat it over rice and put shredded cheese on top.  It lasts for days in the fridge, that is if you have any leftovers.
