Ingredients:
4 cups water
8 cubes chicken bouillon
3 tablespoons cornstarch
4 teaspoons white sugar
1 ⅓ tablespoons oyster sauce
4 teaspoons soy sauce
½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed
1 cup all-purpose flour
1  egg
¼ cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
½ cup cashew halves
¼ cup chopped green onion
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
To Make Sauce: Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; dissolve bouillon cubes in boiling water. Remove 1 cup of this broth and mix with cornstarch in a small bowl, then return mixture to saucepan and let thicken. Stir in sugar, oyster sauce and soy sauce; cover, remove from heat and set aside.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
To Make Chicken Nuggets: In a shallow dish or bowl, flour cubed chicken well and let stand in flour for 15 minutes. In a small bowl, beat egg, milk, salt and pepper together. Remove chicken from flour, dip in egg mixture, roll in flour again and deep fry in a large skillet or deep fryer until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
Place prepared chicken nuggets on a platter; heat sauce over low heat to heat through, then pour over chicken. Sprinkle cashew halves and green onion on top and serve.

Description: 
This variation is famous in Springfield, Missouri, and may be the only way it is prepared there. When I'm not there, I can't find this dish prepared this way anywhere else.
