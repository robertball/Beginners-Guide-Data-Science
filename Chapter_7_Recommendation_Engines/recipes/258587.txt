Ingredients:
5 large green plantains, coarsely chopped
1 (8 ounce) can organic tomato sauce
1 small bunch cilantro, chopped, or to taste
2 tablespoons homemade sofrito
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste, divided
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
1/2 cup vegetable broth, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a 1-quart pot with water; boil plantains with a pinch of salt until easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.
Mash plantains with tomato sauce, cilantro, sofrito, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, and sazon in a mortar or glass bowl. Incorporate the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and enough vegetable broth to ensure that mofongo sticks together but is dry enough to easily slip out of a container. Season with salt and pepper.
Serve mofongo on top of the remaining 5 tablespoons vegetable broth in a bowl.

Description: 
Mofongo is a fried plantain-based dish from Puerto Rico. It is typically made with fried green plantains mashed together in a pilon (which consists of a wooden mortar and pestle), with broth, garlic, olive oil, and pork cracklings or bits of bacon. 
This version is completely vegan. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it!
