Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
3 large carrots, shredded
1/4 head cabbage, shredded
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, cut into 1/2 inch dice
3 cups cooked white rice
soy sauce to taste
3 eggs

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onions; cook until soft and translucent. Stir in carrots, cabbage, and garlic; cook until garlic begins to brown. Stir in kielbasa; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes
Crumble rice with hands to break up clumps. Then stir rice into skillet. Heat through, then stir in soy sauce. Beat 1 egg, and mix thoroughly into rice. One at a time, beat and stir the remaining 2 eggs into the rice. Cover, reduce the heat to medium low, and cook 10 minutes, stirring often.

Description: 
A bit of Polish mixed with an old Filipino favorite. A terrific way to use up left-over rice. Definitely a favorite at my apartment! Be sure to use rice that is cooked the previous day. Fresh rice will ruin this recipe and make it mushy. Add more veggies for variety.
