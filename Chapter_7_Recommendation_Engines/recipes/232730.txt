Ingredients:
5 carrots, chopped
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 small yellow squash, thinly sliced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 pound farfalle (bow tie) pasta
3 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup light cream
1/4 cup tomato sauce
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
15 cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix carrots, broccoli, onion, zucchini, and yellow squash in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Toss to evenly coat vegetables. Spread coated vegetables on 2 baking sheets.
Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir and continue roasting until tender, about 10 more minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain and return farfalle to pot.
Heat butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir garlic in the melted butter until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Pour chicken stock into garlic mixture; bring to a boil. Add light cream; reduce heat and simmer. Stir tomato sauce and Parmesan cheese into sauce.
Combine sauce, roasted vegetables, and cherry tomatoes with farfalle; toss well.
