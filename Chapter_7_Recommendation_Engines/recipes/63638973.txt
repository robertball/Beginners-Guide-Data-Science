Ingredients:
2 cups cane sugar
2 cups water(1 cup for thick syrup)
1/4 vanilla bean

Directions:
Break off about 1/4 of a vanilla bean. I microwave it in 2 tsp of water for 30 seconds to soften it up. (optional)  Separately-In a medium sauce pan mix 2 cups-sugar and either 1 or 2 cups of water. Then spilt the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape seeds into the sauce pan, put the rest of the bean in the pan. Stirring frequently, Let the mixture come to a boil. Let it boil for 2 or3 minutes. Turn off the stove top and let it cool before storing.You can stor it with or without the bean but don't eat the vanilla bean.   When it cools down keep it in the refrigerator.
