Description: 
The real Pina Colada was invented in the Hotel Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico during the decade of the 1950's. The inventor was a bartender who entered a world competition, and won for this drink. He did not patent the recipe for which reason I am able to make some modifications for your delight.
