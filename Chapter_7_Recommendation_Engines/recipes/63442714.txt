Ingredients:
1/2 cup Whole White Wheat flour for coating
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter
8 tablespoons olive oil
2 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup Marsala wine
1/2 cup cooking sherry
1 can of artichoke hearts (drained)

Directions:
In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper and oregano. Coat chicken pieces in flour mixture.
In a large skillet, melt butter in oil over medium heat. Place 4 chicken thighs in the pan, and lightly brown.  Turn over chicken pieces, and add half the mushrooms and artichokes. Pour in half the wine and sherry.  Cover skillet; simmer chicken 10 minutes, turning once, until no longer pink and juices run clear.  Remove from pan, then repeat for the remaining four pieces.

Description: 
This recipe calls for thighs (dark meat) instead of breasts (white meat), like most chicken Marsala recipes, because I prefer that myself, but either can be used.  Also, the artichokes give it an extra bit of tang.Modified from: Chicken Marsala
