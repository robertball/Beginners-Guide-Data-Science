Description: 
A friend of mine sent this recipe to me when I got my first apartment, because she knows how much I hate cooking!  It's really easy -- even I can make it -- and tastes great.  I'm not sure where she found the recipe, but it included the note 'Good source of protein, vitamin A, B group vitamins, calcium.'
