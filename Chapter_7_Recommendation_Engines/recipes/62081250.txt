1 cup or crushed ice
1 half cup of Pina Colada mix
4 oz. Rum (opt.)

Directions:
Pour Ice, Pina Colada mix, and rum (if wanted) into a blender and mix it for 10 minutes (alternating between ice crush, frappe, and mix) or until smooth (with no icey chunks) pour even amounts into glasses (you can strech it out more than  servings but it is best to keep it at 4) then try to get 4 oz of drpepper (about half a can) into each of the four glasses
