Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 egg, beaten
3/4 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)
1 (16 ounce) jar Ragu® Cheesy! Classic Alfredo Sauce
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 medium tomato, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Dip chicken in egg, then bread crumbs combined with paprika, coating well.
Arrange chicken in 13 x 9-inch baking dish. Bake uncovered 20 minutes.
Pour 1 cup Classic Alfredo Sauce over chicken; top with cheese, then tomato. Bake an additional 10 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Serve with remaining Sauce, heated, and sprinkle, if desired, with grated Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
For extra crunch, try using panko breadcrumbs -- which are Japanese-style breadcrumbs with a coarser and crunchier texture. Just mix with a little dried Italian seasoning and continue with the recipe.
