Ingredients:
1/2 onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, pressed
2 tablespoons butter
1 5-inch stem of fresh rosemary
2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 heaping tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup light sour cream
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons dried rosemary

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, heat butter over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic and cook just until soft. Add rosemary sprig and potatoes, cook for 3 minutes.
Add flour and stir well. Add chicken broth (just enough to cover the potatoes - you might not need all 3 cups) and cook for 12-15 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
Remove from heat. Remove rosemary. Use a potato master or hand mixer and blend until desired consistency (I like mine a little chunky). Add more chicken broth if it's too thick.
Stir in sour cream, salt and pepper. Garnish with dried rosemary if desired.
