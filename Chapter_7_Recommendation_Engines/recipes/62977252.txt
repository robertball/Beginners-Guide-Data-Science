Ingredients:
1 pomegranate
2 large ripe Fuyu persimmons, mangoes, or papayas
5 cups mesclun, arugula, baby arugula, or mixed salad greens
6 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions (3)
1 recipe Pine Nut-Persimmon Vinaigrette
4 medium blood and/or navel oranges, peeled and thinly sliced*

Directions:
Score an "X" into the top of the pomegranate.
Break apart into quarters. Working in a bowl of cool water, immerse each quarter; use your fingers to loosen the seeds from the white membrane. Discard peel and membrane. Drain the seeds; set aside.
Cut each persimmon in half; remove core. Slice into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick slices.
In a large bowl combine mesclun and green onions. Drizzle 1/2 cup of the Pine Nut-Persimmon Vinaigrette over musclun; toss to coat.
To serve, arrange mesclun mixture on six chilled salad plates. Arrange persimmons and oranges on top of greens, tucking a few in and under leaves. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds. Pass the remaining Pine Nut-Persimmon Vinaigrette.

Description: 
If desired, substitute two pink or red grapefruit for the oranges or use a combination of oranges and grapefruit. Or use 2 to 3 cups bottled sectioned citrus fruit in place of the oranges. Drain the fruit before adding it to the salad.
