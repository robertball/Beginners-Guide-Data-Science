Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cored and cut into florets
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 boneless pork chops
1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder, or to taste
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 cup roughly-chopped mushrooms
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped, or more to taste
1/2 cup carrot, diced
1/4 fresh poblano chile pepper, diced, or to taste
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons chopped green onion

Directions:
Pulse cauliflower in a food processor until it resembles rice.
Heat sesame oil a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops with five-spice powder; cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork chops to a cutting board to rest.
Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, red pepper flakes, and ginger together in a bowl.
Return wok to medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, carrot, and poblano chile until tender, about 4 minutes. Cut pork chops into cubes.
Push mushroom mixture to one side of wok. Add eggs; cook and stir until scrambled, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir mushroom mixture and eggs together in wok. Stir in cauliflower and soy sauce mixture; add pork cubes. Cook until cauliflower is tender, 3 to 4 minutes more. Garnish with green onions.

Description: 
This is a slightly more spicy (zingy?) take on the paleo-style cauliflower fried rice with pork. You could use any protein. Adjust the poblano chile to mild it down or heat it up as desired.
