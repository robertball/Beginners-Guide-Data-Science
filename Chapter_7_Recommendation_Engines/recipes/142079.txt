Ingredients:
3 pods black cardamom
1  cinnamon stick
1 medium red onion
1 (3 1/2) pound chicken, split in half lengthwise
1 teaspoon dried cilantro
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon salt
2 cups long grain white rice
3 cups milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the chicken, cardamom pods, cinnamon, and whole red onion into a large Dutch oven. Fill with enough water to cover the chicken, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat; boil for 20 minutes. Reserve 4 cups of the resulting chicken stock in a large saucepan.
Remove the chicken and onion from the Dutch oven and place in a roasting pan. Season the chicken with the dried cilantro, black pepper, and salt; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until the chicken becomes golden brown.
Meanwhile, pour the rice in with the reserved chicken stock. Bring the rice to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. once it reaches a boil, cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to low, simmer covered for 15 minutes. Stir the milk into the rice and bring the heat back up to medium-low; cook uncovered until no liquid remains. Serve the rice topped with the chicken and onion.
