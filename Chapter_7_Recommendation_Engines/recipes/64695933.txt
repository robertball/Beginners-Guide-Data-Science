Title:
Fiesta Pretzels by Tammy Recipe

Ingredients:
3/4c oil (vegetable or canola)
12-15oz bag of pretzels (rods are the best but I break them into shorter pieces)
1 pkg  ranch seasoning mix
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp cayenne

Directions:
Add pretzels to zipper bag. Mix together oil and seasoning and pour over pretzels. Let pretzels “marinate” 30-60 minutes to soak up oil and seasonings, turning bag frequently. Place on cookie sheet in single layer, bake at 250 for 30-45 minutes, turning every 15 minutes. Let cool and store in airtight container.
HINTS:
They’re pretty salty already, but you can use garlic salt instead of powder, or use 1/2 tsp each. Or I’ll sprinkle on garlic salt after I spread them on the sheet.
Similar recipes called for a full cup of oil, some used 2 bags of pretzels.  If I were to use 2 packages of pretzels, I’d use two zip bags and 2 cookie sheets for bakingso they wouldn’t be crowded.
Most did not marinate the pretzels, but that made a big difference so I’ll always do that.
WARNING: they are very addicting!
