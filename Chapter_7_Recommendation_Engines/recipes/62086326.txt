Ingredients:
2 cans bean dip or 1 large can refried beans
2 medium avocadoes
1-2 tsp chopped garlic or dried minced garlic
juice of one lime
2 cups sour cream
1 envelope taco seasoning
2 tomatoes, chopped
1-2 cans cheddar chip dip (regular or jalapeno)
1-2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 can medium black olives, sliced
3-4 green onions chopped
cilantro

Directions:
The amounts on this recipe vary for a reason...depending on the pretty container you choose to display your dip will depend on the amounts.  I have this one bowl I only use for this dip for, so I have my recipe down to a science.   Pick a clear bowl/decorative dish, I've noticed that other recipes have said a flat dish but it doesn't show off all the colors this way;  try it for a  even more beautiful display.
first layer- bean dip (if using refried beans, I jazz mine up with a little cumin) spread out on bottom
second layer -  on beans, place chopped ripe avocadoes, drizzle lime juice all over avocadoes, sprinkle with dried garlic, garlic salt or fresh garlic (your preference)
third layer- mix taco seasoning envelope with the 2 cups sour cream.  Carefully spread on avocadoes.
fourth layer - on sour cream, place chopped tomatoes.  Salsa is over seasoned for this dish.  It will over power and kill all the delicate levels of flavor.
fifth and sixth layer-  when i first used this recipe it called for one can cheese dip, it wasn't enough.  I started using two.  But once in a pinch I when i had only one can cheese dip, I used the shredded cheese to fill the holes.  I liked this new addition.  So add shreddd cheese for sixth layer
seventh layer- place sliced olives all over cheese layer.
eighth layer-  place sliced green onions all over black olives
eighth layer-  add cilantro* for garnish
*If you are ones of those people who LOVE cilantro.  You may want to do this....
seventh layer green onions, eighth layer black olives, ninth layer chopped cilantro
NOW you are saying UM, I thought this was a 12 layer dip.  OH YES... 9 visible layers.  But 12 layers of flavor, I promise you.  Now a company makes those heavy duty tortilla chips...FINALLY I have been waiting !!!
