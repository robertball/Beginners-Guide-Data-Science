Ingredients:
32 oz. (one box) Vegetable Stock
One Yellow Bell Pepper
32 oz. (one box) Chicken Broth
One Handful of Baby Carrots
One Small Head of Broccoli
One Can of Corn off the Cob
One Tomato
4 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 tsp Thyme
One Red Onion
Six Slices of Bacon (optional ingredient)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375ºF.
Bring vegetable stock to a boil in one pot and chicken broth in the other.
Cut the pepper in half, place it in the baking dish, and bake it for 15 minutes.
Chop the tomato and the red onion into small pieces and sauté them in olive oil for 10 minutes.
Chop the broccoli and carrots up into small pieces and add them to the chicken broth, along with the corn. Stir them around with a wooden spoon.
When the pepper is done, take it out of the oven and chop it into small pieces, and add it to the vegetable stock (not the chicken broth). When the vegetables are done in the chicken broth, strain them and put them in the vegetable stock.
When the sauté is done, put these veggies into the vegetable stock as well.
Add thyme and heat through.
Fry and chop bacon into small pieces in the second frying pan if you are using it, add it to the soup, and serve it.
