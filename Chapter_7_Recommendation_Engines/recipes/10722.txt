Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup buttermilk
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together vegetable oil (yes, 1 1/2 cups of vegetable oil), sugar and eggs.  Mix in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, buttermilk, salt and vanilla.
Pour teaspoon-sized amounts of batter onto cookie sheets, leaving plenty of room in between.  These cookies will puff up and get large.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.
