Ingredients:
3/4 cup whole wheat pancake mix
2 tbs ground flax seed
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 cup rolled oats
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup olive oil
1 mashed banana
1/4 cup egg beaters or 1 egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup chocolate chips
1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Combine the pancake mix, flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and oats in a bowl. Set aside.
With an electric mixer, blend brown sugar, olive oil, mashed banana, egg, and vanilla. Get this nice and smooth, then add it to the dry mixture and blend.
Add the chocolate chips and nuts to the bowl and stir.
Refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour so the mixture can thicken.
Spoon out tablespoon size dough balls at least an inch apart. I recommend using a silpat on the pan so they don't stick. Bake for about 12 minutes.
Remove the cookies and enjoy.
