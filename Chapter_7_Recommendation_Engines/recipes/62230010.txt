Description: 
Lovely tart apples are sliced up and arranged in a baking dish with lemon juice and water. Sprinkled on top is a delicious crumble topping made of oats, brown sugar, a bit of flour, butter, and chopped walnuts. And then the crisp is baked until the apples are tender and the top lightly browned.Modified from: Nutty Apple Crisp
