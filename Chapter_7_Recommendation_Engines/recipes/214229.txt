Ingredients:
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
1 bunch fresh spinach, rinsed and dried
1 pint strawberries, sliced
4 ounces crumbled goat cheese
1 (5 ounce) package candied pecans (such as Emerald(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Pecan Pie Glazed Pecans)
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing

Directions:
Place the chicken breast meat into a skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinaigrette over medium heat; cook and stir until the chicken is browned, no longer pink in the center, and the juice has nearly evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a bowl and let cool.
Place the spinach into a salad bowl; scatter the strawberries, goat cheese, and candied pecans over the spinach. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinaigrette over the salad and top with the chicken. Serve slightly warm or chilled.
