Ingredients:
1 (1 pound 1.5 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker® sugar cookie mix
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 egg
3/4 cup dark chocolate chips
2 (14 ounce) bags caramels, unwrapped
1/3 cup whipping cream
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly spray 48 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.
Make dough as directed on cookie pouch. Shape dough into 48 (1-inch) balls. Press 1 ball into bottom of each muffin cup, pressing up sides to fill cups.
Bake 8 to 9 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Meanwhile, in 3-quart saucepan, heat caramels and cream over medium heat, stirring frequently, until melted. Reduce heat to low.
Remove pans from oven; gently press end of wooden spoon into bottoms and against sides of cookie cups to flatten, being careful not to make holes in dough.
Bake 2 to 3 minutes longer or until edges are light golden brown. Immediately spoon 1/2 teaspoon (about 4) chocolate chips into each cookie cup.
Spoon about 1 tablespoon caramel mixture into each cookie cup. Immediately top with chopped pecans. Cool 5 minutes; remove from pans with narrow spatula.
