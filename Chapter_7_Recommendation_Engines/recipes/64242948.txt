Ingredients:
3/4 cup Butter-flavored shortening
1 1/4 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 egg
1 3/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 to 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped pecans, (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375F.  Combine Butter Flavor Crisco, brown sugar, milk and vanilla in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed of electric mixer until creamy.  Beat egg into creamed mixture.
Combine flour, salt and baking soda and mix into creamed mixture until just blended.  Stir in chocolate chips and pecan pieces.  (NOTE:  If nuts are omitted, use 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips)
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls (about 2 measuring tablespoons) of dough 3 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheet.
Bake at 375F for 8 to 10 minutes for chewy cookies (cookies will appear moist - DO NOT OVERBAKE). or 11 to 13 minutes for crisp cookies.  Cool on baking sheet 2 minutes.  Remove to foil on counter top until completely cool.
*****NOTE:  OK.  There are a few things I do to make this recipe even more special.
1)  I ALWAYS use Pampered Chef Stoneware to bake my cookies.  It makes all of the difference in the world for texture. (Of course I add 1 to 2 minutes to the first batch baking time.  Subsequent batches are at the times/temps listed.)
2)  I like using Parchment Paper on my stones.  It keep the clean up to a bare minimum.
3)  I ALWAYS use the best ingredients:  Ghiradelli chocolate (if available), real Land O Lakes Butter, C & H Sugar, etc.
4) In this recipe I use 1/2 cup MILK chocolate chips, 1/2 cup Semi-Sweet or Double Chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup White (or sometimes Butterscotch) chocolate chips.
5) In this recipe I split the nuts into two types 1/2 cup slivered almonds and 1/2 cup medium sized pecan pieces.
6) Last but not least, when they say put the cookies on FOIL to cool?  They mean it!  It makes all the difference between a perfect cookie and a SOGGY one!
