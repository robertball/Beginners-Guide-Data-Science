Ingredients:
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons margarine, melted
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 9x13 inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine Parmesan cheese, dry bread crumbs, oregano, parsley, paprika, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts into melted margarine, then coat with bread crumb mixture. Place in prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
