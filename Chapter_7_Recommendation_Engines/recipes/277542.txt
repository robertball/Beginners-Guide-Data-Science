Ingredients:
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, sliced, or more to taste
4 cups chicken broth
1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves removed and chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup raw cashews
1 tablespoon tahini
1/4 avocado

Directions:
Place cauliflower florets into a bowl of lightly salted water and soak for 20 minutes.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil in the preheated oven until brown on top, 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add broth, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Let simmer until cauliflower is ready.
Stir cauliflower into the broth with cashews and tahini. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and let simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Add avocado and blend using an immersion blender. Serve.
