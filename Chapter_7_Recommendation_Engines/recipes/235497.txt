Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon dried chives
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
Pinch freshly ground black pepper
4 strips bacon, diced
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup grated yellow-fleshed potato
1/2 cup diced leek (white and light green only)

Directions:
In a large measuring cup, whisk eggs, water, chives, garlic powder, onion powder, rosemary, and black pepper; set aside.
Fry diced bacon over medium high heat in a 10-inch (25 cm) non-stick skillet until crisp. Remove and place onto paper towel lined plate to drain. Wipe skillet and return to medium heat. Add butter to skillet and cook grated potato, stirring for 5 minutes. Stir in leeks and cooked bacon; cook, stirring for 5 minutes or until vegetables start to become golden. Pour egg mixture over bacon mixture and as egg begins to set, use a spatula to gently push cooked portions to the centre. Tilt pan to allow uncooked eggs to flow into empty spaces. When eggs are almost set, fold omelette in half and cook for 1 minute or until golden brown. Cut into thirds to serve.
