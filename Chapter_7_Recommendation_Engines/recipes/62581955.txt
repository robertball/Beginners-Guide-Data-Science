Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pie crust
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar
1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups half and half
1 14 oz. can artichoke hearts, drained well
8 oz. roasted red and yellow peppers, chopped
4 scallions, greens and whites, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
pepper and salt to taste

Directions:
Pre-bake the pie crust in a deep dish pie plate for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and allow to cool a few minutes.
Whisk together eggs and half and half.
Chop artichokes, peppers, and scallions.  Add to egg mixture and season to taste.
Spread shredded cheese into pre-baked crust.  Pour egg mixture on top and distribute evenly.
Bake at 350 for 50-60 minutes or until middle is set.  (I use a crust guard for the first 40 minutes and remove it for the last 20.)
Remove from oven and allow to sit 10 minutes or so before cutting.
