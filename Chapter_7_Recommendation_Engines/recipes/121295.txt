Ingredients:
2 cups 1% buttermilk
1 cup Grape-Nuts cereal
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the buttermilk and cereal; let stand for 10 minutes. Add egg. Combine the dry ingredients; stir into cereal mixture just until moistened. Spoon into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
Grape-Nuts cereal gives these fast-to-fix loaves their nutty flavor and chewy texture. 'The bread is a family favorite because it's so unusual,' writes Melissa Walworth of Boise, Idaho. 'Warm slices are delicious with butter,' she adds.
