Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 tsp grated lime zest
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tbsp honey
2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
1/2 tsp ground ginger
4 cups shredded romaine
4 cups fresh baby spinach leaves
2 kiwi fruit, peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and thinly sliced
1/2 cup canned sliced water chestnuts, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/4 cup sliced scallions
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place almonds on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, be sure to turn them over so they don't burn. Let cool and set aside.
Grill chicken over medium heat just until juices run clear. Set aside and allow to cool. Cut chicken into slices and save any juices that have collected on the plate.
In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, honey, lime juice, lime zest, ginger and liquids from the cooked chicken. Wisk ingredients together.
Place chicken in a bowl and pour 1/3 of the mixture onto the chicken. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 1-2 hours.
On four plates evenly distribute the romaine and fresh spinach. Line the outside of the plates with the oranges, kiwi and water chestnuts.
Place the chicken in the center of the plates and sprinkle with the scallions and roasted almonds.
Drizzle the plates with the remaining dressing (including what was left from the bowl the chicken was marinating in).
