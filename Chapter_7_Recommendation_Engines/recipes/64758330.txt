https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 cup sugar
3/4 cup margarine (I use Blue Bonnet)
6 oz evaporated milk
2 cup peanut butter (18 oz)
7 oz marshmallow fluff
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Line a 9 by 13 pan with foil & lightly spray with cooking spray.  Set aside.
In a 5 quart pot, combine butter, sugar & milk over medium high heat.  Stir constantly till the mixture reaches a boil.  Continue stirring, reduce heat to medium & boil for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat & quickly stir in peanut butter till smooth.  Add the marshmallow fluff & vanilla & stir till fluff is completely incorporated & all is smooth.  Spread evenly into the prepared pan.   Allow to cool completely before removing from pan using the foil & cutting.
*I measure the peanut butter on a plate and remove the fluff from the jar to a plate.  This makes it really quick to get it into the boiled mixture.  And I measure the vanilla in a little cup to speed things along.
** I cut the 9 by 13 into 6 pieces & then cut each half pound block into 16 bites.

Description: 
Using margarine in this recipe results in a creamy, softer fudge than when I use butter.
