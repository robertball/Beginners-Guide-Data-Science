Ingredients:
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
3 tablespoons wheat germ
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
4 cups bread flour
1 1/2 cups sourdough starter
3 tablespoons margarine, softened
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon cornmeal

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bread machine using the Manual cycle.  That's usually two mix cycles of approximately 15 to 20 minutes with the rise cycle between them of about an hour.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Form the dough into a single round loaf. Place the loaf on a baking stone or baking sheet which has been lightly oiled and sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover loaf and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool on a wire rack.
