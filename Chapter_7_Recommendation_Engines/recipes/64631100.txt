Ingredients:
1 cup of real butter ... softened
1/2 cup of powdered sugar
2 cups of all-purpose flour

Directions:
oven 350 degrees  baking time 16-18 minutes
makes 4 dozen small cookies
start by mixing the butter and sugar together with a beater in a bowl ... easy creamy
then using the mixer add the first cup of flower on low setting
then using a spatula or wooden spoon ... stir in the other cup of flour bit by bit
it will all unstick from the edge of the bowl and make a perfect dough
i use a cookie form pan to make my hearts ... i roll a small bit into a ball then push it into the forms one at a time ... and skimming off the extra top part with a knife ...
easy way to get the cookies out of the form ... placing a baking cooling rack over the cookies then flip over ... tap the back side of each cookie form with a spoon or the heavy end of a knife ... they will pop right out (my cookie form is no-stick)
also ... i melted a bit of chocolate chips and used a brush to paint on the melted chocolate then slightly dip them in candy pearls ...
have fun!!
