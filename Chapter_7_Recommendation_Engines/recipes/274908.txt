Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 (8 ounce) package kale, chopped
1 refrigerated pizza dough
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 (5 ounce) crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a pizza stone in the oven to preheat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil. Add kale in batches until all is cooked through and dark green, about 15 minutes. Set aside.
Roll dough out to desired thickness. Place dough onto a pizza peel and add kale, garlic, and goat cheese, in that order. Carefully place pizza onto the preheated pizza stone.
Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese and crust is slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
