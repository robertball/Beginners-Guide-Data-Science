Description: 
I was asked to take a salad to a backyard get-together and didn't want to just take the same old thing, so I came up with this recipe, which combines features of several different salads I've had in the past. Look for my recipes for balsamic vinaigrette and creamy orange soy dressings on this site. Both are excellent with this salad.
