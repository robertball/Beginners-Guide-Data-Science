Description: 
Melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness is the only way to describe this sweet and flavorful grilled pork tenderloin. Marinating at least overnight with just a few ingredients makes this an easy meal. It is my college daughter's favorite entree and I know to make it whenever she comes home. I like to serve with softened polenta or mashed potatoes and green beans. Great on sandwiches as well.
