Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 cups mashed ripe bananas
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 (1 ounce) squares white baking chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 cup flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine butter and sugar; mix well. Add eggs and extracts; beat on high speed until thickened. Stir in bananas. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to banana mixture. Fold in the chocolate, coconut and pecans. Transfer to two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 70-75 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
White chocolate is the wonderfully different addition to this tropical-tasting bread. The moist slices are so scrumptious, they disappear as soon as I serve them.
