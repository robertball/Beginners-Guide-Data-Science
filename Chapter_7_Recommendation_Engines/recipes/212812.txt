Ingredients:
1 quart vegetable oil
15 slices white bread, cut into 2-inch squares
4 cups whole milk
2 cups white sugar
4 cardamom pods
4 whole cloves
2 cinnamon sticks
1 pinch saffron
1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry the bread squares in the oil until crispy and brown; remove to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Stir the milk and sugar together in a saucepan; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Add the cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon sticks, and saffron; simmer together for 15 minutes. Remove and discard the whole spices. Set the mixture aside to cool to room temperature.
Arrange the bread in a flat-bottomed serving dish. Gently pour the milk mixture over the bread until all pieces are covered. Chill in refrigerator 2 to 3 hours. Garnish with the almonds to serve.
