Ingredients:
2 refridgerated pizza crusts
1 package frozen steak sandwich meat (enough to make 7 sanwiches)
1 cup mozzerella cheese
steak sandwich sauce (or other favorite sauce)
diced bell peppers, onions (optional)

Directions:
prepare steak, sauce, as normal.
roll dough on to pizza pans
slice dough into 2 inch sections (lengthwise) you may slice in half again to make smaller portions for kids.
*an alternate idea is to roll out 1 crust and spread steak on top.  Place a second crust on top, seal edges and cut in sections with a pizza cutter.
place steak ingredients by tablespoons on top of dough.
sprinkle desired amount of cheese on top
fold dough up over the top of steak and press shut at seams.
bake according to pizza crust directions.
