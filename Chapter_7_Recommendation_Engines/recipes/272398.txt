Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat
½ cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ cup flour
1  egg, beaten
avocado oil cooking spray

Directions:
Place chicken thighs, 1 at a time, between 2 sheets of parchment paper and flatten with a mallet.
Combine bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl and beaten egg in a third shallow bowl. Dip chicken thighs first in flour, then in beaten egg, and finally coat with bread crumb mixture.
Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place breaded thighs in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; work in batches if necessary. Mist with avocado oil and cook for 6 minutes. Flip each thigh, mist with oil, and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
I find chicken thighs to be more flavorful than chicken breasts, and this schnitzel is a perfect example. Not only is it delicious, it is also cooked in the air fryer, making it lower in calories, oil free, and grease free.
