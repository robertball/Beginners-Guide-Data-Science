Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 teaspoon minced orange zest
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
2 tablespoons instant coffee granules
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Gently stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, salt, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and orange zest in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, sour cream, milk, and eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed in a separate large mixing bowl until blended.
Gently stir flour mixture into the liquid ingredients just until batter is moistened and smooth. Dissolve coffee granules in water in a small bowl and stir coffee mixture into the batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Modified from a recipe in a coffeehouse series mystery. You may add a frosting or glaze, but these are sweet enough on their own.
