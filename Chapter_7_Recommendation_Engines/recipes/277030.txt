Ingredients:
Cake:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
3 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups diced apples
1 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup dried cranberries
Glaze:
1 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.
Place flour, white sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in apple, pecans, and cranberries until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside.
Combine brown sugar, butter, and milk in a small saucepan. Bring mixture to a rolling boil over high heat; continue to boil, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla extract and salt.
Pour glaze over the hot cake. Let cake sit in the pan to cool and for glaze to set, about 2 hours.
Remove cake from the pan. Place onto a plate, top-up; the glaze may puddle around the bottom edge of the cake. Serve when completely cool.
