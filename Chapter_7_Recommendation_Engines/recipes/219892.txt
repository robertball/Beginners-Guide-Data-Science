Description: 
A nice switch from the Mexican layer dip. Super easy and very versatile! You can switch this recipe up in many ways to adapt it to your taste, this is just how we like it best. Add more or less of anything you like personally. Roasted red pepper on top is also good. Serve with pita chips.
