Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
About 1 1/2 tablespoons nut oil (I used lemon olive oil)
1/2 cup steel-cut oatmeal
2 tablespoons flax seed meal
1 large or 2 small ripe bananas, sliced 1/4" thick
About 1 1/2 tablespoons honey, divided
2 tablespoons chopped toasted pecans

Directions:
Boil 2 1/2 cups water in a saucepan; stir in salt and 1/2 tablespoon oil, then oats.
Cook, stirring, until oats start to thicken and look creamy, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until oats are thick and very creamy, about 20-25 minutes.
Stir in flax seed meal.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a nonstick frying pan over medium heat; add bananas and cook until translucent at edges, about 3 minutes.
Flip, drizzle with 1 tablespoon honey and cook until soft and lightly browned, about 1 minute more.
Stir 1/2 tablespoon honey into oatmeal and pour into two bowls.
Stir in more oil and some nuts.
Top with bananas and more pecans.
