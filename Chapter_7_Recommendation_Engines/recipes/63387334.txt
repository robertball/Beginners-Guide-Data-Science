1/2 lb chicken breast (or beef strips), sliced
1/2 onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, diced or mashed
2 T oil
2 limes (or lemons) squeeze for juice
1 t chili powder
1/4 t ground cumin
1/2 t salt
1/2 t pepper
6 large flour tortillas

Directions:
Toss meat and ingred together and marinate for at least 1/2 hour (the longer the better).  To cook, layer the chicken and larger pieces of veg on a broiler pan and place in broiler for a few minutes or until chicken is done.  discard juices.  The meat also can be grilled over the barbeque, or pan fried.  If pan frying, add all of the veg and juices to the pan with the meat.
TIME SAVER:  Prepare the meat and marinade in bulk (but do not cook) and freeze in meal size pouches.
