Ingredients:
2 cups bias-sliced carrots and/or fresh green or wax beans, cut into 2-inch pieces
4 cups broccoli florets, sweet pepper strips, halved and sliced zucchini or yellow summer squash, and/or fresh asparagus, cut into 2-inch pieces
12 ounces dried fettuccine, linguine, vermicelli or spaghetti
1 small onion, cut into thin wedges
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups reduced fat milk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 ounces prosciutto, cut into thin strips
2 tablespoons snipped fresh basil

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook carrots and/or beans in a small amount of boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Add the broccoli, sweet pepper, zucchini or yellow summer squash, and/or asparagus. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and cook 3 minutes more or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Drain.
Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or large pot cook pasta according to package directions. Drain; return to Dutch oven. Add the vegetable mixture to the Dutch oven and keep warm while preparing sauce.
For sauce, in a medium saucepan, cook onion and garlic in hot butter over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes or until tender. In a medium bowl using a whisk, stir together LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, flour, salt, and black pepper. Add to onion mixture in saucepan. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.
