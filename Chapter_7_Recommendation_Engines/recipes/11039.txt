1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
Cream butter and sugars together until fluffy. Add eggs and blend well. Stir in salt, baking soda and flour. Blend until the flour is incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips.
Use a melon baler sized ice cream scoop to scoop out chunks of dough. Place onto greased or parchment lined cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool cookies on a rack and place on a serving platter. Enjoy!

Description: 
I cook for a college fraternity with 56 members. The guys love these cookies. I work in large batches, obviously, and use a 5 quart mixer bowl for these. You can easily half this recipe for smaller batches.
