Ingredients:
1 cup roasted butternut squash (see "how to" below)
1 tbsp butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 cup Campbell's First Stock Cream Stock
1 tbsp flour
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1/2 tbsp lemon juice
Sea salt (or other coarse salt) and pepper to taste
1 450g box short pasta (I used rotini)
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup parmesan cheese

Directions:
How to roast Butternut Squash: Peel and chop squash (carefully!). Place in large casserole dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Toss with olive oil and sea salt and roast for approx. 40-45 minutes in pre-heated 425F oven. If you don't have time to roast a squash, simply pick up pre-packaged ready for the microwave squash (my grocery store keeps them in the same cooler as the pre-packaged salads and refrigerated salad dressings).
Cook pasta according to package directions.
In saucepan melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic and saute approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
Add in cream stock and flour and whisk until combined.
Add in mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper, whisk until combined.
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add squash and cheese sauce (careful it's hot!) to blender or food processor and blend until smooth.
Place sauce back in pan, add cooked and drained pasta and stir until coated (Note: you can stop here and just enjoy as is or you can make the crunchy top as follows).
Pour into casserole dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray and top with parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.
Bake in preheated 350F oven for 15-20 minutes until top is brown and sauce is bubbly.
