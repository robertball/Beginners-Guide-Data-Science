Description: 
A very easy and delicious frozen dessert, it's inspired by the ice cream pie that Friendly's used to sell.  It had been my husband's favorite treat and he was disappointed when they stopped selling it.  I made this version as a birthday surprise and now it's a traditional birthday request in our house!
