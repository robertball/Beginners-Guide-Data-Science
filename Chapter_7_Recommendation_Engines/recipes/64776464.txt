Ingredients:
1 cup brown lentils
3/4 cup raw buckwheat groats
1 small onion
1 small carrot
1 tbsp olive oil
4.5 cups low sodium vegetable broth, divided
2 bay leaves
9 ounces fresh baby spinach
3 tbsp evoo

Directions:
Soak the lentils in water for one hour. Grate the onion and carrot with the large teeth of a grater. Drain the lentils and set aside.
Heat the oil in a dutch oven or heavy bottomed stew pot. Add shredded onion and carrot. Sauté until soft. Add lentils and bay leaves and stir to coat. Add 3 cups low sodium vegetable broth and stir. Bring to a boil. Leave at at slow boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer and add the buckwheat. Simmer until the lentils are cooked, soft but not mushy, and the buckwheat is cooked through (about 25 minutes). Add more broth if needed. Once the lentils and buckwheat are cooked, remove from the heat source and fold in the fresh spinach until wilted. Remove the bay leaves. Serve hot with 1/2 tbsp evoo on top of each portion.

Description: 
Lentils and buckwheat simmer to make a hearty stew. This is a typical ‘zuppa’ for a Winter evening in Italy. Serve with crusty bread topped with a bit of extra virgin olive oil. Typical to most Italian food, this is healthy and delicious; naturally low sodium, vegan, gluten free, and low fat.
