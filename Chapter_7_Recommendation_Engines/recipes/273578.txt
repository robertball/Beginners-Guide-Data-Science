Ingredients:
1 thick-skinned potato
3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1 egg
1 slice bacon, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Poke potato with a knife to allow air to escape while cooking. Wrap potato in a damp paper towel. Cook in a microwave oven until tender, 4 to 6 minutes per side, depending on size.
Cut off top of cooked potato lengthwise. Scoop out flesh, leaving about 1/2-inch worth of 'crust.' Sprinkle lining of potato with 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese. Break egg into potato and top with bacon, remaining Cheddar cheese, and chives.
Bake in the preheated oven until egg is set and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes.
