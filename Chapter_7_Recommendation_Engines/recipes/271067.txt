Ingredients:
12 ounces sweetened condensed milk
1 cup lime juice
3/4 cup water
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger tequila, or more to taste
12 small paper cups
12 ice pop sticks
4 limes, each cut into 3 discs
1/4 cup margarita salt, or as needed

Directions:
Mix condensed milk, lime juice, water, and tequila together in a bowl or pitcher. Fill 12 small paper cups nearly full with the mixture, leaving 1/2 inch between the liquid and the lip of each cup.
Spear each ice pop stick through the middle of a lime disc so the discs sit evenly in the middle of the sticks. Place one speared ice pop stick into each filled paper cup so the stick is submerged and the lime slice is sitting on top of the liquid.
Place cups into the freezer for 8 hours to overnight. Rip and peel paper cups off of the ice pops. Pour margarita salt into a shallow bowl and dip ice pops in margarita salt before serving.

This boozy popsicleÂ® recipe is so fun to share and tasty to enjoy, especially because of the smoothness added by using condensed milk! Add a bit of other juices, such as guava, orange, or grapefruit juice, for variation!
