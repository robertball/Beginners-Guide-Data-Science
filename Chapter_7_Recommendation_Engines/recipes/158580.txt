Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3 pound) whole chicken
salt and pepper to taste
2 lemons
1 onion, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon crushed garlic

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then fry in the hot oil until browned on all sides.
Meanwhile, chop one of the lemons into chunks and place into a slow cooker along with the onion, thyme, white wine and garlic. Cut the remaining lemon into quarters and stuff into the cavity of the chicken. Place the chicken into the slow cooker breast side down on top of the onion and lemon mixture. Cover and cook on Low for 6 hours, or for 3 hours on High. Chicken is done when the legs move easily in their sockets and the internal temperature of the breast has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
I couldn't find a slow cooker recipe for chicken that was quite right at the time, so I made one up, and it has been a hit!  Browning the chicken first avoids the strange pale chicken common to slow cooked chickens.
