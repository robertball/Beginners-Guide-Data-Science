Description: 
A euphoric paradise of tropical fruits,banana pudding, pound cake,shortcake and coconut, layered with dreamy cool whip and topped with fresh fruit to create a refreshing, cool summer dream that wont weigh you down on a hot day. Start the day before by making the pudding and draining the fruit chunks. You may also choose to make your own cake rather than the store bought packages if you've the time and enjoy the effort. If you do, make the cake a day ahead of time. Trifle, no matter what kind, is always a holiday favorite in my family, adjusting the flavors to the seasons.
