Ingredients:
3 lbs. small new red potatoes
4 hard boiled eggs
1 tbsp. white wine vinegar
2 scallions, chopped
1/4 cup red bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup dill pickle, chopped (about 2 small pickles)
1 1/2 tbsp. dijon mustard
1/2 cup light sour cream
1/2 cup salad dressing or light mayonnaise
2 tbsp. fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp. fresh chives, snipped
1/2 tsp. dried dill weed
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in large pot and cover with water.  Bring to boil and boil for 10 minutes or until just tender.  Drain and rinse in cold water until cool enough to handle (I like to peel half of them and leave the peels on the other half.)
Cut into 1" chunks and place in large bowl; sprinkle with white wine vinegar.
Add scallions, red pepper, pickle.  Season with salt & pepper.
Add dijon mustard, sour cream, salad dressing/mayo and stir til potatoes are coated.
Stir in parsley, chives, dill.
Peel and coarsely chop boiled eggs and gently stir into salad.
Season with additional salt & pepper if desired.
