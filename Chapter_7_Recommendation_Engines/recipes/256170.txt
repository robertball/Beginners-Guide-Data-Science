Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
4 ribs celery, diced
1/2 (16 ounce) package baby carrots, diced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, or to taste
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
black pepper to taste
3 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
4 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams, undrained
2 (8 ounce) bottles clam juice
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole potatoes, drained and diced
1 dash Worcestershire sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, carrots, basil, garlic, and black pepper until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer 1/2 of the vegetable mixture to a food processor.
Stir 2 cans stewed tomatoes into the pot. Drain the remaining can of stewed tomatoes and add to the food processor. Blend vegetable-tomato mixture until smooth. Stir pureed mixture into pot with vegetables.
