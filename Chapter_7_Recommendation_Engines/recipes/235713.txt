1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground thyme

½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Rub seasoning mixture over the entire chicken to evenly season. Put rubbed chicken into a large resealable plastic bag; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Remove chicken from bag and cook in slow cooker on Low until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 4 to 8 hours.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
