Ingredients:
48 large unpeeled shrimp (about 2 pounds)
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons bottled minced garlic (about 12 cloves)
2 tablespoons steak sauce
2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
cooking spray

Directions:
Peel shrimp, leaving tails intact. Combine lemon juice, wine, garlic, steak sauce, and pepper in a large zip-top plastic bag; seal, and shake to blend. Add shrimp; seal. Marinate in refrigerator 20 minutes, turning bag once.
Prepare grill.
Remove shrimp from bag, discarding marinade. Thread 8 shrimp onto each of 6 (12-inch) skewers. Place kebabs on a grill rack coated with cooking spray, and grill 2 minutes on each side or until shrimp are done.
