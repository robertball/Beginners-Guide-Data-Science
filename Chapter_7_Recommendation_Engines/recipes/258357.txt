Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 1/2 tablespoons dried minced onion
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice
1 (8 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
2 teaspoons dried parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Combine minced onion, seafood seasoning, oregano, basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms to coat with onion mixture. Add clams with juice. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Toss clam sauce with pasta in a large bowl. Top with dried parsley.
