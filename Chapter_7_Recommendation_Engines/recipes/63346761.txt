Ingredients:
3/4 c. mayonnaise
grated rind from 1 lime
2 tsp. fresh lime juice
1/2 tsp. rice vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp. sweet chili sauce
2 tsp. sugar
3 Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro
1/4 medium red onion, finely diced (more to taste)
4-5 cups shredded green cabbage

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the mayo with the lime rind, lime juice, rice vinegar, garlic, sweet chili sauce and sugar until well blended.
Stir in the cilantro and onion. Add the cabbage a cup at a time, stirring well. Keep adding cabbage until the mixture reaches a non-soupy but adequately dressed consistency. (You can always add more cabbage, but you can't take it out.)

Description: 
This recipe is very flexible, meaning that I rarely remember to put all of the same ingredients/proportions in twice and it still tastes great.
