Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, diced
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (14.5 oz) can coconut milk
salt and black pepper to taste
1 tsp curry powder
(1 cup sour cream)
(1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste)

Directions:
Roast squash at 400F for 1 hour or until soft.
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, ginger, and jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the butternut squash and chicken broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.
Stir in the coconut milk, curry powder, salt and pepper. Cook and stir 5 minutes more.  You can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with sour cream and thyme to serve.
