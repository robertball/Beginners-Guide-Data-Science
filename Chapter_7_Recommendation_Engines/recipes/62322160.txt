Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter (softened)
1/2 cup milk
extra butter (optional)

Directions:
Mix flour & salt together, add butter and mix with a pastry blender (or fork) until crumbly.
Stir in milk; use your hands to create a dough.
Roll out to desired thichness. I like just a little thicker then 1/4 inch.
Use a pizza cutter to make sandwich sized pieces, poke holes in all pieces with a fork.
Bake at 350* for about 30 minutes or until just starting to turn gloden brown.
Rub butter over while still hot and if you want to slice for sandwiches, do so while it is warm.
