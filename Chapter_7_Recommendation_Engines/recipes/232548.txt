Description: 
I had never had chicken corn soup until I moved to south central Pennsylvania. It is often found at local fairs and festivals and is now my favorite comfort food. This is a quick and easy version that shaves quite a bit of time and effort from the traditional method but tastes pretty close to the real thing.
