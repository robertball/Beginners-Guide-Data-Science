Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 (3.5 ounce) links mild Italian sausage, diced
1 large green bell pepper, diced
1 large onion, diced
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 (16 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough
2 tablespoons garlic butter, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage, green bell pepper, onion, water, salt, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cook and stir until onions and green pepper are soft and sausage is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Drain excess oil. Add mozzarella and Cheddar cheese on top and allow to melt.
Dust a work surface with flour. Roll out pizza dough into a thin layer. Cut into 8 equal squares. Stir sausage-cheese mixture to combine. Spoon onto each square, leaving about 1/3 of the dough clear. Pull excess dough over the filling to form a roll; pinch shut. Arrange rolls on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Brush garlic butter over the tops.

I like this recipe because it's different than a calzone or pizza roll. It's easy to make and delicious!
