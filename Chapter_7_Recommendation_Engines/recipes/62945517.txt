Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine condensed milk and peppermint
extract. Beat in enough confectioners' sugar, a little at a time,
to form a stiff dough that is no longer sticky.
Form into 1 inch balls, then place on waxed paper and flatten with
fingers to form patties. Let patties dry at room temperature two
hours, turning once.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate with
shortening, stirring often.
Remove from heat. Dip patties, one at a time, into chocolate by
laying them on the tines of a fork and lowering the fork into the
liquid. Let cool on waxed paper until set.
