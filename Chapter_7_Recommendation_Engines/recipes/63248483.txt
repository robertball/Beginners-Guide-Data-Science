Ingredients:
1 package thinly sliced deli meat - roast beef, chicken, or turkey
SAUCE:
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 medium roma tomato, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced jalapeño pepper (from a jar)
1 tablespoon minced cilantro
1 carton (8 oz) sour cream
SANDWICHES:
1 medium green pepper, cut into strips
1 onion, cut into thin wedges
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, softened
8 slices firm sourdough or Italian bread, 1/2 inch thick
1 medium ripe avocado, peeled and thinly sliced
8 slices deli-style Pepper Jack cheese

Directions:
Combine all of the sauce ingredients and set aside (1 diced onion, 1 diced tomato, minced jalapeño pepper, minced cilantro, 8oz sour cream).
In a small pan, cook the pepper and onions for the sandwiches (not the sauce) in hot olive oil until tender.  Remove from pan and set aside.
Butter one side of each slice of bread.  Place four slices of bread, buttered side down, on work surface.  Top each slice with 2 slices of cheese, 2 slices of the deli meat, some peppers and onions, some avocado, and about 2 tablespoons of sauce.
Top with remaining bread, butter side up.  Grill on panini press (or in a pan at medium heat) for approximately 4 minutes, or until the bread turns golden brown, flipping once.  Serve immediately.
