Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 pints half-and-half
1 teaspoon dried parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) can oysters
2 dashes Louisiana-style hot sauce

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until it begins to foam.
Cook and stir the celery, onion, and red bell pepper in the hot butter until soft, about 10 minutes.
Stir the half-and-half and parsley through the vegetable mixture; season with salt and black pepper.
Continue cooking until the mixture just begins to boil; add the oysters and any liquid from the can to the stew along with Louisiana-style hot sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the oysters begin to curl, 10 to 15 minutes more.
Remove the saucepan from heat and allow the stew to sit 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Oyster Stew has always traditionally been served by my mother and her Hollingsworth family roots from Georgia every Christmas Eve. The colors of red and green are very Christmas-like. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
