Ingredients:
1 ripe mango, peeled and pitted
3 ripe bananas
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 lime, juiced
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
3 large eggs
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 teaspoon lime juice, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Blend mango, bananas, brown sugar, and juice of 1/2 lime in a blender until smooth.
Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl. Mix butter, eggs, and  mango-banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Whisk confectioners' sugar, water, and 1 teaspoon lime juice together until glaze is smooth and thick; spoon onto cooled muffins.
