1 teaspoon orange extract

Pour milk into a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until starting to bubble, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add white chocolate. Cook, stirring continuously, until chocolate is fully melted, about 15 minutes. Add orange extract; cook and stir until incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat.

Description: 
This is a very favorite winter drink of mine. Sometimes, in my family, we will make this in the middle of summer when we're craving something sweet and comforting. It's got a gentle, yet smooth, taste to it and is sure to please anyone who loves white chocolate and orange. For myself, I make a soy milk version of this since I cannot handle dairy and I love it. Serve immediately and top with orange zest, marshmallows, or whipped cream if you wish.
