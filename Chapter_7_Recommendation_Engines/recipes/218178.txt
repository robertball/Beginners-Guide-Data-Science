Description: 
Super easy and absolutely great version of the longer and original recipe for this soup that my grandmother brought from Russia. On a hot summer day, a bowl of this soup is an energizing lift.  Add a piece of of rye or pumpernickel bread served on the side to complete the Russian experience.
