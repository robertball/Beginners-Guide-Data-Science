Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) cans water-packed artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 cup butter, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese, divided
1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
1/8 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
In a skillet, saute the artichokes and garlic in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Transfer to a greased 1-qt. baking dish.
In a saucepan, melt the remaining butter. Stir in flour, salt and pepper until smooth.  Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir a small amount of hot mixture into egg; return all to pan, stirring constantly. Stir in 1/4 cup cheese until melted.
Pour over artichokes; sprinkle with remaining cheese. Combine crumbs and paprika; sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
