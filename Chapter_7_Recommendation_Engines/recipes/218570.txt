Description: 
This is my son's favorite summer treat to make either in the ice cream freezer or into popsicles. If you use frozen strawberries in a blender, you can turn the recipe into a smoothie. Great way to use up leftover buttermilk. When I made it the first few times, I hid the buttermilk so he wouldn't know what was in it!
