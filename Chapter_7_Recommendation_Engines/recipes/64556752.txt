Ingredients:
3-4 carrots, sliced
3 stalks celery, sliced
1/2 large white onion, chopped
8-10 medium sized shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1/2 bunch chard, chopped
6 cloves garlic, halved
Salt & pepper to taste
2 bay leaves
2 Tablespoons tamari soy sauce
1 Tablespoon Better Than Boullion Vegetable Base
8 oz. extra firm tofu, cubed (optional)
2 potatoes, chopped (optional)
8 oz. cooked fusili pasta (optional)
Grapeseed oil or other cooking oil

Directions:
Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat.
Add the cooking oil. When oil is hot add the onions, carrots, celery, and potatoes if using. Saute 2-3 mins.
Add the shiitake mushrooms. Continue to cook until onions are translucent, stirring frequently.
Add the chard and garlic. Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste.
Cook until chard is wilted, then add water to the pot until all veggies are covered. Add more water to emphasize the broth, less to make the soup more hearty.
Add bay leaves and more salt to taste. Bring heat up to high until boiling, then lower heat to simmer for 35 mins.
While soup is simmering, cook pasta in a separate pot according to package directions (if using).
After 35 mins, add cubed tofu (if using), 1 Tbsp of the Better Than Boullion, and 2 Tbsp tamari. Stir to combine, and simmer for another 10 mins. Taste and add salt if necessary.
Turn off the heat, add pasta (if using) to each serving bowl, ladle soup over, and serve!
