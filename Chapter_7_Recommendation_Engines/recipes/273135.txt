Ingredients:
1 cooking spray
2 tablespoons salt
1 large head cauliflower, cut into small florets
2 cups low-fat cottage cheese
2 cups low-fat sour cream
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup green onions, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup chopped blanched almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking dish with cooking spray.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season with 2 tablespoons salt. Add cauliflower and cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well and place between several layers of paper towels to dry. Transfer cauliflower to a large mixing bowl and set aside.
Combine, cottage cheese, sour cream, butter, green onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir cheese mixture into the bowl with the cooked cauliflower and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Spoon Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with an oven-proof lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a small skillet over medium heat and add almonds. Cook, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Sprinkle almonds on top of cheesy cauliflower bake and return to the oven for 10 minutes more.
