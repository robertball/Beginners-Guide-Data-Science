Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 cups white sugar
4 large eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole milk
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups fresh blueberries washed and picked through removing stems.
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Grease a 10-inch tube pan and line with parchment paper.
In a sauce pan, over medium heat, place the blueberries, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla extract.
Cook until berries are softened and juices form.  Gently smash berries leaving some in larger pieces.  Cook until juices thicken and they coat the back of a spoon thickly.  About 5 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes.
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add sugar and mix well.
Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.
Gradually mix flour, milk, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt into butter mixture until batter comes together.
Pour 1/3 batter into the prepared pan batter into the prepared pan. Spoon 1/3 of the blueberry mixture over batter.  Repeat two more times ending with blueberries on top.  Swirl gently with a knife.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
