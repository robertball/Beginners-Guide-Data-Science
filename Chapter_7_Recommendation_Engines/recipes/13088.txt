2 pounds meaty beef soup bones
2 quarts water

In a large kettle, combine soup bones, water, and peppercorns. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat comes easily off the bones.
Remove bones. Strain broth; chill.
Skim off fat. Remove meat from bones; dice and return to broth along with carrots, turnips, celery, onion, and barley. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer about 1 hour or until vegetables and barley are tender.
