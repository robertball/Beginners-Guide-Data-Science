Ingredients:
olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tsp sambal
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp brown sugar
1/8 tsp ground cloves
Pinch of Italian seasoning (alternative: Oregano)
Dash of Paprika
16 oz Can of diced tomatoes (drained)

Directions:
heat olive oil in a sauce pan.
Add onions and sauté until onions are clear.
Add garlic, and continue to sauté for 2 minutes.
Add sambal,and sauté for 2 more minutes.
Add tomatoes and bring to boil. (If you don't drain the Can, your sauce will be too thin. Spooning out the tomatoes is also a way to do it).
Add remaining ingredients. Stir, and let simmer at medium heat for 1 minute. Allow to cool, and serve.
