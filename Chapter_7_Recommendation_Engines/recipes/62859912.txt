Ingredients:
4 large seitan chicken breasts
Kosher salt to taste
freshley ground black pepper
nonstick cooking spray
3 medium vegan bacon
1 clove garlic, minced
2 medium fresh jalapenos, minced
1 16oz refried black beans
1 14.5oz low-sodium 99% fat-free vegan "chicken" broth
1 bottle light beer (Corona Light)
1 cup shredded romaine lettuce
1 cup chopped roma tomatoes
4 6-inch ezekiel tortillas

Directions:
Dust the seitan with kosher salt and pepper.  Place on a preheated grill and cook until done.  Chop, and set aside.
Lightly coat a medium skillet with nonstick cooking spray.  Lightly brown the vegan "bacon".  Add the garlic and jalapenos, and saute until the garlic is soft and fragant, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the beans, then slowly add the broth, stirring until smooth.  Use half the can of broth, as the beer will bring the beans to the desired consistency.  Slowly stir in the beer.  Spoon chopped chicken into 4 tortillas.  Serve the beans next to the tacos, shredded romaine, and tomatoes.
