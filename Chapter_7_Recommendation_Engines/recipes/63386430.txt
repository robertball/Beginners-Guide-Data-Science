Ingredients:
1 3-5lbs pork shoulder roasted and pulled
2 onions, chopped
3-4 celery sticks, chopped
1  head of garlic, roasted and chopped
4-5 green peppers, seeds removed & roasted
4-5 Anaheim peppers, seeds removed & roasted
3 Sweet Banana peppers, seeds removed & roasted
3 Jalapenos, seeds removed & roasted
2.5lbs Tomatillos, washed
1 Tbsp Oregano
2 tsp Coriander, ground
2 tsp Cumin
1 bunch Cilantro, chopped
2-3cups Chicken stock
1 can Coconut milk
Dash Cinnamon & Nutmeg
Salt/pepper, to taste
¼-½ cup Olive oil

Directions:
1.	Cut the end off the garlic head, drizzle with olive oil and place in oven to roast.
2.	Roast all peppers and tomatillos in oven or BBQ. Let steam in covered bowl or sealed plastic bag for 10 min and then remove skins. Rest.
3.	In a stock pot, cook olive oil, onions, celery and cook until the onions start to glisten (sweat). Add the pulled pork, chopped roasted garlic head, chopped cilantro and all the spices. Add half of the chicken stock and simmer.
4.	After the skins are removed from the roasted peppers and tomatillos, add to blender or food processor to create a green mixture. Add this mixture to the pot with the coconut milk. Bring to slow boil then simmer.
5.	Allow the mixture to cook down, adding more chicken stock until it is all consumed or it has reached the consistency desired. It’s recommended to let chili simmer 1-2hrs for best results.
6.	Enjoy with a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips or use as taco filling.
