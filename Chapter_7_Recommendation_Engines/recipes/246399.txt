Ingredients:
1/2 cup cold butter, divided
1 1/3 cups buttermilk
2 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 1 tablespoon butter in two 10-inch cast iron skillets.
Place skillets in the preheated oven to heat up and melt butter, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix buttermilk and eggs together in a small bowl.
Combine flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt in a large bowl. Rub in remaining 6 tablespoons butter with your fingers until mixture is crumbly. Gently stir in buttermilk mixture until dough just starts to come together.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut dough into 24 biscuits.
Remove skillets from the oven. Arrange 12 biscuits side-by-side in each, their edges touching.
Return skillets to the oven and bake until biscuits are puffed and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Experimentation and a need for more biscuits per batch led me to what we think are the best biscuits anywhere! For optimum flavor, these must be baked in hot, buttered cast iron skillets. They are great for breakfast with gravy or jellies. Also excellent with beef stew for dinner. My husband likes the leftover biscuits even better. He breaks them open on a plate and smothers them with molasses.
