Description: 
The story with the recipe is:
These messy wonders were made before going to a Van Morrison concert. Like my favorite musician, they have a lovely bassline, slightly rumbling, with green herbal accents that could be wildly construed as Irish if you need that kind of excuse. If music be the food of love, it tastes like these. Serve them broiled, fried or grilled, with sauteed mushrooms, onions, melted Jarlsberg and olive tapenade on crusty grilled slabs of garlicky bread.
