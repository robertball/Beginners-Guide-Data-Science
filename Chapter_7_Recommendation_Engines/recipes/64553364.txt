Ingredients:
1 cup crumbled cauliflower
1 cup kale, removed from ribs & shredded
1 1/2 tsp grated parmasean
6 large egg whites
2 large eggs
1 tbsp milk
1/2 tsp thyme
1/4 tsp garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add cauliflower crumbles to the skillet with 1/4 cup water.
Cover the skillet to cook the cauliflower until it softens, about 8 minutes.
While the cauliflower is cooking, mix eggs, milk, salt and pepper with a hand mixer until fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add kale, garlic powder and thyme to the skillet stirring to combine with the cauliflower.
Once the kale has wilted, removed the vegetables from the skillet and add them to the egg mixture.
Spray the skillet with nonstick cooking spray and add the eggs and vegetables back into the skillet, sprinkle with parmesan, cover and cook until the edges are set, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile heat the broiler to high. After 5 minutes, remove the cover and place the skillet in the oven for 8 minutes until the top of the frittata is cooked.
