Ingredients:
3-4 lb boneless sirloin tip or beef rump roast
Worcestershire Sauce (lots)
1 packet Brown Gravy Mix
8 sandwich rolls

Directions:
Place roast in roasting pan on a piece of heavy alumumium foil, large enough to wrap meat in. Douse (at least 1/2 bottle for me) roast with worcestershire sauce; seal meat in foil. Bake in preheated ove at 350 for 4-5 hours on middle rack. Remove roast from oven;Allow it to sit a few minutes before slicing it up. Save meat juices and put in a saucepan; add seasoning packet. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer according to pkg. directions. Warm sandwich rolls. Serve thin slices of roast in sandwich rolls with bowls of juice for dipping.

This is an easy recipe that fills the house with a wonderful smell! I like to melt Provolone cheese on these sandwiches, maybe you would too.
