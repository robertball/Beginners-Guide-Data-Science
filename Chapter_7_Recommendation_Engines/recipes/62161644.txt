Ingredients:
3 c. all-purpose flour
4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 c. sugar (or sweetener)
1 tsp. salt
2/3 c. chilled butter
1 egg
1 1/4 c. milk
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients together.
Cut cold butter into dry ingredients until crumbly.
In a separate bowl, beat egg, milk and vanilla.
Add wet to dry and stir to combine (do not over-mix).
Pour into 9-inch round pan (springform works well).
If possible, let mixture rest for 15 minutes to activate baking powder.
Bake 20-25 minutes until lightly browned and knife inserted in center comes out clean.
Slice and serve with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.
