Ingredients:
3 - 8oz. packages of mushrooms
1 package sausage
8 slices of regular bacon (not thick)
(shortcut:  use the pre-cooked/shredded bacon in the salad dressing section)
1 package of cream cheese, softened
2 slices of whole wheat bread
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
2 Tbsp. of butter
Olive Oil
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Wash mushrooms and remove stems - set stems aside.  Use a spoon to scoop out the mushroom gills to make as much room for stuffing as possible.  Place mushrooms in an oven safe dish and drizzle with olive oil.  Swish around in dish to cover the mushrooms evenly, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Put bread in food processor and make fine crumbs.  Melt butter in microwave, and toss over the breadcrumbs.
Cook and crumble sausage until well done.  The smaller the pieces, the better.  Add to breadcrumbs.
Cook bacon until crispy, and then chop in the food processor.  Add to breadcrumb mixture.
Add mushroom stems to food processor and finely chop.  Add to breadcrumb mixture.
Add the parmesan cheese to the mixture and mix thoroughly.
Add the cream cheese to the mixture and mix thoroughly.
Using your hands, roll mixture into small balls and stuff into mushrooms.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30-40 minutes.
