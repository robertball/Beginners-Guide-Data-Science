Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 1/4 cups apple butter
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8x4x2-inch loaf pan.
Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl.
Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Add the egg and apple butter; continue beating until smooth. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the raisins and walnuts; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
