Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 pound Brussels sprouts
2 teaspoons prepared Dijon-style mustard
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
Dissolve cornstarch in 1/4 cup water, and set aside.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring chicken broth to a boil. Add Brussels sprouts, and cook until tender. Strain, reserving chicken broth, and place Brussels sprouts in a warm serving dish.
Return chicken broth to stove, stir in mustard and lemon juice, and return to boil. Add cornstarch mixture. Cook and stir until thickened. Pour over Brussels sprouts to serve.

Description: 
The Brussels sprouts are cooked in chicken broth and therefore do not have the bitter aftertaste they have when cooked in water. My children love this recipe.
