Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can lite luncheon meat (such as Spam速)
cooking spray
1/2 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix, or more to taste
2 tablespoons water, or more as needed
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
8 ounces shredded lettuce
8 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
2 (2.25 ounce) cans sliced olives, drained
1 small tomato, diced
1 small onion, diced

Directions:
Shred luncheon meat onto a large plate using a cheese grater.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add shredded luncheon meat; cook and stir until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in taco seasoning and water. Cook and stir until luncheon meat is evenly seasoned and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low to keep warm.
Spray another skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet and cook until heated through, about 30 seconds per side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Top warm tortillas with luncheon meat, lettuce, Cheddar cheese, olives, tomato, and onion.

Description: 
Yes, this dish is made with Spam速. I use the low-sodium Spam速. This dish is quick, easy and delicious. I also made Mexican Rice as a side dish to go with the tacos. You can also top your tacos with sour cream, guacamole, or salsa.
