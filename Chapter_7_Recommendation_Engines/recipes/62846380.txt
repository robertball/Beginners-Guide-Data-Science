Ingredients:
Loaf of cheese topped bread (Asiago usually)
Butter
Feta cheese
Thin-sliced baby or lacy swiss
Sea salt

Directions:
Slice bread into half-an-inch pieces (however many pieces you want) and butter them lightly but evenly across the inner surface on both sides. Then add a small sliver of butter to a pan and toast the bread, over medium-high heat, to a light brown. Now top the bread with two slices of the swiss-just enough to cover the bread, so you may have to break or cut the slices smaller-and sprinkle a good layer of feta over it. Turn your toaster on broil and toast until swiss is melted onto bread. Take out and lightly crack sea salt over top.
