Ingredients:
1 cup light vanilla yogurt (I use Dannon's Light and Fit)
1 cup heavy cream (could use half and half)
1/2 cup skim milk
1 cup frozen sweet cherries (could use more, to taste)
1/2 cup sugar
3-4 T sour cherry juice concentrate (available in the produce section at most groceries; add more or less to taste, this gives the sour punch and a lot of great, dark color)
2 t almond extract
pinch of salt

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in blender.
Blend until frozen cherries are small chunks, sugar is integrated and color is uniform
Process in ice cream maker as directed by manufacturer--usually 20 to 25 minutes, or until mixture has increased in volume, has creamy texture and is somewhat firm.
Chill at least 2 hours, until firm.
Enjoy!

Delicious combination of cherry flavors!  A favorite with kids (who love the sour zing), it is made with yogurt, real fruit and some cream!
