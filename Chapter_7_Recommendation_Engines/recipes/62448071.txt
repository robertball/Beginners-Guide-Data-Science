Ingredients:
4	boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Salt & pepper
4	slices (1/2 oz. each) prosciutto ham
4	slices (1/2 oz. each) smoked provolone, Mozzarella or any smoked cheese
1	cup spinach leaves, chopped, or  ¼ to 1/3 cup frozen thawed, and squeezed dry.
4	tablespoons flour, divided
1	tablespoon olive oil
1	tablespoon butter
1	cup chicken broth
1	tablespoon heavy cream

Directions:
1.	Slice chicken breasts horizontally, stopping about ½ inch from long side of each breast.  Open breasts like books; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper inside and out.  Lay 1 slice prosciutto, 1 slice provolone and ¼ cup spinach in each chicken breast.  Fold closed.
2. 	 Spread 3 tablespoons flour on a plate; season flour.  Holding chicken breast closed, dredge both sides in flour; shake off excess.  Repeat with remaining breasts.
3.	Heat oil and butters in large skillet over medium heat.  Place chicken in skillet; cook about 4 minutes per side or until browned.  Turn skillet down to medium low, cover and cook until chicken is just done.
4.	 Remove chicken to a serving dish and cover to keep warm.
5.	Meanwhile, combine chicken broth and cream in small bowl.  Whisk in remaining tablespoon flour.  Pour broth mixture into skillet; cook, stirring, until sauce thickens (about 3 minutes). Spoon sauce onto serving plate; top with chicken breasts.
