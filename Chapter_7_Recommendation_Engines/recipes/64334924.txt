Ingredients:
2 Firm Pears (Bartlett or Anjou)
1/2 cup Apple Juice
1/2 cup Water
1 Tbsp Honey
16 oz Plain Greek Yogurt
4 Tbsp Maple Syrup
1/2 cup Granola

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
Cut the pears in half lengthwise, and remove cores with a spoon. Place in an 8x8-inch baking pan, cut-sides down.
Pour apple juice and water over pears, and drizzle with honey. Cover pan loosely with foil and bake about 35 minutes or until tender.
When pears are done, pour the leftover baking liquid into a small saucepan and reduce over medium heat until about 1/4 cup of syrup remains; set aside to cool.
Open the container of Greek yogurt and stir in the maple syrup. Divide yogurt into four bowls. Place a half of the warm pear in each bowl, cut side up. Top with granola and drizzle with syrup you set aside.
