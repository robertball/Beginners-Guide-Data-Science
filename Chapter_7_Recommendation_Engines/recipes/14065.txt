Ingredients:
3 carrots, sliced
1 large zucchini, sliced
1 large yellow squash, sliced
1 red onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 cup spaghetti sauce
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch garlic salt
ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (18 ounce) package prepared polenta

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Saute carrots, zucchini, squash, onion and bell pepper in a large saucepan with a small amount of olive oil.  Season with garlic salt and pepper. Saute vegetables for approximately 5 minutes and pour in spaghetti sauce.  Stir, cover and simmer until vegetables are slightly tender.
Slice polenta into 1/2 inch circles and season with garlic salt and pepper. Heat enough oil in a medium skillet so as to completely cover the entire bottom of the pan. Pan fry seasoned polenta in hot oil, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from oil and layer the slices in a large casserole dish. Spoon the vegetable mixture over the polenta and then sprinkle with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Bake casserole for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Fresh summer vegetables paired with creamy polenta baked in an Italian sauce and topped with cheese -- delicioso!  I recommend serving it with crusty garlic bread.
