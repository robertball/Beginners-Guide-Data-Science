Ingredients:
2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can chocolate-flavored sweetened condensed milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons crushed peppermint candies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with foil baking cups.
Combine chocolate wafer crumbs and butter in a medium bowl; divide mixture evenly among the prepared muffin cups, pressing firmly to form crusts.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 6 minutes. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Keep oven on.
Beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Beat in sweetened condensed milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract into a smooth filling. Divide filling evenly over the cooled crusts.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Remove foil baking cups gently.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Drizzle melted chocolate over cheesecake bites and sprinkle with peppermint candies. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
