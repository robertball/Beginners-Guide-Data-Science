Ingredients:
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
Salt and pepper to taste
Garlic powder or Mexican garlic seasoning
1 and 1/2 cups cooked long grain white rice
1 can black beans
1 can white corn kernels
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
3/4 cup Iceburg or Romaine lettuce, chopped
1/3 jar store bought salsa (chipotle works nicely for this)
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Season chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic seasoning; grill on indoor or outdoor grill (George Foreman grill is best) until cooked through; cut into strips or bite-sized chunks. Also warm up the black beans and white corn on the stovetop while chicken is cooking.
Create an assembly line and split the ingredients in layers on two plates in the following order: warm rice, black beans, white corn, chicken. Top the warm ingredients with the cheese, then lettuce, then salsa, and finally the sour cream. Grab a fork and dig in!

Description: 
I love to eat at places like Qdoba and Chipotle, so I went home and created my own chicken burrito - minus the tortilla! This is very easy for a weeknight meal and is very filling and healthy; the recipe can easily be increased for more people.
