Ingredients:
Crust:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg white, whisked until frothy
Filling:
2 cups coconut-flavored Greek yogurt
2 eggs
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons coconut extract
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
Mix flaked coconut, sugar, and flour together in a bowl. Mix in egg white until crust holds together. Press crust into the bottom of the greased pan.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until pale, about 18 minutes. Let cool.
Blend coconut yogurt, eggs, sugar, and coconut extract together in a bowl until smooth. Mix in cornstarch and salt. Pour filling over cooled crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges start pulling away from the pan and center jiggles slightly when shaken, about 35 minutes. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
Chill cheesecake in the refrigerator until firm, about 3 hours.

Description: 
I love cheesecake, but sometimes feel guilty about eating it... or even thinking about it. So I decided to replace the cream cheese with Greek yogurt and went with coconut because it's one of my favorite flavors. This one doesn't make me feel as guilty to eat. I top mine with drizzles of dark chocolate and toasted coconut shavings.
