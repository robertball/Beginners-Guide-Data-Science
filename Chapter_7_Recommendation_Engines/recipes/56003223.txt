Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 peeled and deveined large shrimp (21 to 25 per lb)
6 mushrooms, stems removed
flat parsley leaves
2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cook the mushroom caps upside down at 350F for 10 minutes. Dry and remove.
Heat the butter and garlic in a skillet over medium heat until the butter begins to bubble. Coarsely chop the shrimps. Stir in the shrimp, and cook until they just turn pink, about 3 minutes. Place some shrimp into each mushroom cap, and place into a small baking dish. Spoon the garlic butter into the mushroom caps, and sprinkle each with a pinch of mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are tender and the cheese is golden and bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.
