Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch paprika, or to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
3 pounds chuck roast
1/4 cup butter
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed beef consomme
1 cup water
1 1/2 (1 ounce) envelopes dry onion soup mix
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 carrots, chopped, or to taste
1/4 onion, chopped, or to taste
3 mushrooms, sliced, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Whisk flour, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a bowl. Dredge roast through the flour mixture to evenly coat.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat; brown roast in the melted butter, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer roast to an oven bag and put into a 13x9-inch casserole dish.
Whisk beef consomme, water, onion soup mix, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; pour into the oven bag over the roast. Cut 6 small slits in the top of the oven bag for ventilation.
Bake roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour 45 minutes; add carrots, onion, and mushrooms to the oven bag and bake until vegetables are tender and roast is cooked through, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
