Ingredients:
1 package of 5 Basil Garlic Sausages
1 tblsp Minced Garlic
1/2 pound Penne Pasta Olive oil
3/4 cup Plain yogurt
Green Beans (amount to your liking)
Salt & Pepper

Directions:
Start with boiling some water in a saucepan and toss in the pasta of your choice (about a half pound or so if you like more) (follow the directions on your package)
Slice the desired amount of green beans (my mom always said sliced diagonally made them taste better)
In a large skillet drizzle about 2 tablespoons or a bit more of olive oil and add the minced garlic. Heat it over medium heat.
Add the green beans to the oil and garlic
Stir the beans and also the pasta on occasion
Slice the sausage in about 1/2 inch slices ... this is out you make easy peasy sausage meatballs
Stir the sausage into the bean mixture and keep over medium heat and stirring
The sausage mixture only takes about 10 minutes or so to cook all the way through
Spoon the plain yogurt into the sausage mixture and keep mixing.
Turn down the heat a bit ...
Drain the pasta ... and spoon into the sausage skillet
Add a bit of salt & pepper to taste if you like
Stir all together over low heat a bit ...
And Serve!!
Sprinkle a bit of fresh seasoning of choice on the top if you like ... or a bit of grated cheese
Enjoy!!
