Ingredients:
4 zucchini, halved
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced

1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
sea salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a shallow baking dish.
Scoop out the flesh of the zucchini; chop the flesh and set aside.  Place the shells in the prepared dish.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute onions for 5 minutes, then add garlic and saute 2 minutes more.  Stir in chopped zucchini and mushrooms; saute 5 minutes.  Stir in coriander, cumin, chickpeas, lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper.  Spoon mixture into zucchini shells.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until zucchini are tender.

Description: 
A great vegetable dish that can be used as a centerpiece or as a side. Can be lovely when served with tomato based sauce and a green vegetable, or I have even had them with traditional roasted vegetables at Christmas.
