Ingredients:
4 cups green (under ripe) mangoes - peeled, seeded, and diced
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup serrano peppers, finely chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 tablespoon black pepper
2 tablespoons molasses
1 small cinnamon stick
4 whole cloves
1 cup water
1 cup cider vinegar

Directions:
Place the mango, raisins, serrano peppers, garlic, ginger, lemon zest, black pepper, molasses, cinnamon, and cloves into a large saucepan. Pour in the water and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered until a jam-like consistency is attained, about 30 minutes. Stir frequently while cooking. Once thickened, cool, and store in the refrigerator. The chutney may also be frozen.
