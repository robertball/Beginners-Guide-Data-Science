Description: 
There are a lot of ways to cook deer innards and having deer heart seared at a high heat in a cast iron skillet is one way. Trimming the heart and removing the little tendons and then soaking in salt water for a bit before cooking is the first thing. We like serving it for breakfast with hash browns made from dehydrated ingredients, dark rye toast, and served with eggs sunny side up.
