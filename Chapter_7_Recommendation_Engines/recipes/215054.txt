Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 pounds fresh blackberries
1/2 cup semi-dry fruity red wine, such as Sangiovese

Directions:
Heat the sugar and water together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until the sugar is dissolved completely, making a simple syrup. Set aside to cool.
Puree the blackberries in a blender or food processor; strain through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any seeds or pulp. Whisk the strained blackberry juice, the cooled simple syrup, and the red wine together in a bowl; chill in refrigerator until cold.
Freeze in the freezer canister of an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions

Description: 
A refreshing twist on a blackberry sorbet. Due to the 1/2 cup wine, this sorbet will not freeze hard.  Serve out of the freezer as soon as possible.
