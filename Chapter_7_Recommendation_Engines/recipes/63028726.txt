Ingredients:
9x12" lavash flatbread
olive oil spray
3 tbsp marinara sauce
2 oz reduced fat shredded mozzarella
pinch dried oregano
2 tbsp fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450Â°. If you have a pizza stone, heat it as well.
Spray lavash lightly with oil then top with sauce. Too much sauce will make the bread soggy so don't over-do it.
Top with cheese and oregano, then bake until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
Remove from the oven and cut into 4 pieces. Top with fresh basil and eat immediately.
