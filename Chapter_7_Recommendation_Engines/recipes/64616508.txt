Instructions
CRUST: Combine the crushed graham crackers, sugar, cinnamon and melted butter in a cake pan. Once the ingredients are mixed well, gently pat them down to form the crust.
CREAM CHEESE FILLING: In a mixing bowl, combine cool whip, cream cheese and powdered sugar until mixed well and fluffy. Pour the filling on top of the crust. Gently spread it out to make the next layer.
STRAWBERRY LAYER: In a pan, combine the Danish dessert package with the water. Cook on a medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and changes color. Add the strawberries and stir until completely blended. Let cool for about 5 to 10 minutes before gently adding this to the top of the cream cheese layer. Gently spread it out and cover the cream cheese layer.
Put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to set up.
Notes
You can use frozen strawberries, but make sure you drain them before adding them to the Danish dessert.
