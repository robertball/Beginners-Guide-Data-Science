Ingredients:
5 cups fresh apricots, pitted and sliced
3 cups water
3 cups white sugar
6 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Combine apricots, water, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and butter and margarine in a large pot. Cook over medium low heat till apricots are thoroughly cooked.  You may need to adjust the water or sugar, depending on the tartness and the amount of cooking.  The apricots need to be very sweet and very juicy.
Cut the tortillas into 1 inch strips.
Add tortilla strips to the apricots a few at a time.  Cook about 20 minutes on very low heat.
This cobbler can also be made in a 3 quart casserole dish, and baked in the oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I have made chicken and dumplins with tortillas for some time, but had not thought of using them in sweets until I decided I had better empty the freezer of apricots before this years crop gets ready.  I had about 6 tortillas left that day from the chicken so gave it a try.  Have also used thick plum pulp and everyone raved about the dumplins.  This is a great way to use up some of the fruit or juice we have left from last years canning or freezing.  It is so easy to do, and best of all, no mess. Fresh, frozen or canned apricots may be used for this recipe.
