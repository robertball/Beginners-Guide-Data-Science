Ingredients:
2 cups Swiss chard, or more to taste
8 ounces ground turkey
1 (8 ounce) package bulk pork breakfast sausage (such as Bob EvansÂ®)
1 medium sweet potato, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Remove stems from Swiss chard. Chop stems and leaves, keeping in separate bowls.
Place turkey and sausage into the bottom of a cold, heavy-bottomed pan and break up slightly using a utensil. Heat over medium-high heat and cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn off heat, transfer meat to a large bowl using a slotted spoon, and leave fat in the pan.
Return pan back to the stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sweet potato and cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add chard stems and cook for 3 minutes more.
Add garlic, turmeric, sea salt, and cinnamon to the pan; stir to combine. Cook until sweet potatoes are just soft, about 5 minutes. Add chard leaves and apple cider vinegar. Continue cooking until greens have wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, mix in cooked meat, and serve warm.
