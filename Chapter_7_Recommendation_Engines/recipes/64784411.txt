Ingredients:
1ea 14 oz can of tomatos
5-6 cloves garlic
1-2 tea minced ginger
1 tea turmeric
1/2 tea cayenne pepper
1 tea smoked paprika
1 tea kosher salt
1 tea garam masala

4 oz heavy cream
1 tea Garam Masala
1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
1. Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and the extra 1 tea of garam masala.  Mix the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce.
2.  Close the cooker and set for 10 minutes on high pressure and let release pressure naturally for 10 minutes.  After that, release all remaining pressure.
3.  Open up the pot and remove the chicken and set aside.
4.  Blend together all the ingredients (use immersion blender if you have one)
5.  Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.  Let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and cream.  This will help thicken the sauce.
