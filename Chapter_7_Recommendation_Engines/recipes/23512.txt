Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup skim milk
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 egg yolks, well beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
2 egg whites

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl; stir in milk, lemon juice, egg yolks, and lemon zest until smooth.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold egg whites into flour mixture; pour into a 1-quart baking dish.
Set baking dish in a baking pan. Pour water into baking pan to make a 1-inch deep water bath around baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle, about 50 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

Description: 
A light lemon dessert! Delicious! I usually double the recipe and bake it in ramekins. My mother used to make this and it has been a favorite with our family or anyone we serve it to.
