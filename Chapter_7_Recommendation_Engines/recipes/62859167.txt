Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, diced
1 medium red bell pepper, diced
1 small fresh hot chili pepper, seeded and minced
1 16 ounce can diced tomatoes
1 16 ounce can crushed tomatoes
2 16ounce cans red or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
2 teaspoon chili powder, to taste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, optional
8-10 ounces spaghetti
Diced riped tomatoes
Chopped onion
Grated cheddar-style nondairy cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or steep-sided stir fry pan.  Add the onion and saute over medium heat until translucent, then add the green and red bell peppers and continue to saute until the onion is golden.
Stir in the remaining ingredients except the spaghetti and garnishes and bring to a simmer.
Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti until al dente, drain.
For each serving, place a small amount of spaghetti in a wide shallow serving bowl and top with some of the chili.  Top with tomato, onion and vegan cheese, if desired.
