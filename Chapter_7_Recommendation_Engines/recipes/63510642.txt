Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 Tsp fish sauce
1 Tsp Soy Sauce
Ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Preheat your Sous Vide vessel/oven to 185 degrees farenheit. If you don't have a Sous Vide oven you can easily make this dish with a dutch oven filled with water and a digital thermometer. You'll just have to work a little bit more with alternating heat and ice water to keep your water temp as close to 185 as possible.
2. Chop cauliflower into roughly 2 inch chunks and combine in a bowl with remaining ingredients. Toss to coat.
3. Vacuum seal in a sous vide bag.
4. Cook in water bath at 185 degrees for 40 minutes and serve.

Description: 
With so many great asian dishes (check out Chef John's carmel chicken for example) on this site we are always looking for interesting side dishes to pair with them. This simply invented sous vide side proved to be a a great accompaniment. My family fights over who gets to finish it.
