Ingredients:
3 pounds ground beef
3 eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half crosswise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix ground beef, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, bread crumbs, garlic, onion powder, salt, black pepper, oregano, and basil in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Form meat mix into 2-inch meatballs.
Wrap half a bacon slice around a meatball; turn the meatball around 45 degrees and wrap a second half-slice of bacon around the meatball so the meat is enclosed by bacon. Repeat, forming 12 meatballs and wrapping each one in 2 half-slices of bacon. Place wrapped meatballs onto the prepared baking sheet with seam sides down.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink inside and bacon is crisp, about 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Pour off excess grease.
