Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) thick salmon fillets
1 (6 ounce) can lump crabmeat, divided
4 slices smoked Gouda cheese
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 lemons, juiced - divided
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill
1 (2 ounce) jar capers in brine, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim the salmon fillets, if necessary, to remove thin portion; with a very sharp knife, cut the fillets horizontally through the center but leave one end uncut so the fillet opens like a book. Place 1/4 of the lump crabmeat onto each opened fillet, and top crab with a slice of smoked Gouda; close the fillets. Place each fillet into a single-serving baking dish. Mix the melted butter and juice of 1 lemon in a small bowl, and drizzle the lemon butter over all the salmon fillets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is opaque and flakes easily, 30 minutes or as needed.
In a bowl, mix the juice of the 2nd lemon with sour cream and dill; spoon sour cream mixture over each baked fillet, and sprinkle liberally with capers. Serve immediately.

Description: 
(By Cookie Lover with my edits).  Salmon fillets stuffed with smoked Gouda cheese and lump crabmeat are baked and served with a lemony dill-sour cream sauce. The presentation of each elegant fillet, baked in its own serving dish, adds to the specialness.Modified from: Glenn's Blowing Rock Salmon
