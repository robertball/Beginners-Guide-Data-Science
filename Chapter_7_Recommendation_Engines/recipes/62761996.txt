Ingredients:
3 - 4 lbs skirt steak
One whole bunch of parsley - chopped fine
a whole head of garlic chopped fine (ok this is the way it came to me but I think something enlarged in the translation so I'm working on that.
1/2 cup of soy sauce (I prefer Kikkoman)
1/2 cup of olive oil.

Directions:
Mix parsley, garlic, soy sauce and olive oil into large sealable plastic bag.
Place steaks in bag and swish
Soak overnight if possible or at least a few hours.
I prefer everything cooked on the grill but you can also pan fry these and they are awesome.
More refinement to come

Description: 
Skirt steak is a very tasty although not so tender cut of mest.  But if you know how to cook it, it's a delight.  And if you can find it, also very reasonably priced.  This recipe is so easy that it's hard believe how good it is.  Now we're going to start this the way the recipe was taught to me and they way I cook, no real stringent measures, but I'll try to work it down to something more reasonable as I can
