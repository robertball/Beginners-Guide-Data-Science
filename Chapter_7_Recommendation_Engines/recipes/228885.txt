Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 envelopes Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons Spice Islands® Italian Herb Seasoning
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup Mazola® Vegetable Plus! Oil
2 eggs
8 ounces shredded cheese blend (Cheddar Jack, Cheddar mozzarella, etc.)
6 slices cooked bacon, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Combine 1-1/2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, Italian herb seasoning, salt and garlic in a large mixer bowl. Heat water and oil until very warm (120 degrees  to 130 degrees F); gradually add to flour mixture. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in 1 cup cheese and remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Spread batter on greased 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan or rimmed baking sheet with at least 1-inch sides. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; top with bacon. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until done. Cover loosely with foil during last 5 to 10 minutes of baking if cheese begins to overbrown. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack. Serve as strips or squares, or slice and use for sandwiches.
