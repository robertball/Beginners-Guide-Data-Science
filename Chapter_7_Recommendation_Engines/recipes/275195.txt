Ingredients:
1 cup loosely packed rosemary leaves
9 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons chicken broth
1 shallot, peeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
3 pounds pork tenderloin
4 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
4 medium potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
4 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch chunks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine rosemary, garlic, balsamic vinegar, chicken broth, shallot, olive oil, pepper, and salt in a food processor. Blend until slightly chunky.
Rub all sides of tenderloin with 1/2 to 3/4 of the mixture. Place tenderloin into the bottom of a roasting pan.
Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven, for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine remainder of the rosemary mixture with parsnips, carrots, potatoes, and celery in a large bowl.
Add vegetable mixture to the roasting pan with tenderloin. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Transfer back to the oven and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the tenderloin reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour.
Remove tenderloin from the roasting pan and let rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, return vegetables to the oven and continue to cook until easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
I loved the combination of herbs and spices that acted as both a wet rub for the pork and seasoning for the potatoes and vegetables--sweetness from the balsamic vinegar and parsnips, earthiness from the rosemary and carrots, and a little tang from the garlic.
