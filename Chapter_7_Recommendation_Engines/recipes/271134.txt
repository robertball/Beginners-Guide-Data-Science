Ingredients:
1/4 pound dried white navy beans (optional)
1 leftover ham bone
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, diced
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 cup chopped carrots
1 1/2 pounds dried yellow split peas, rinsed and drained
1 cup chopped leftover ham
salt to taste

Directions:
Soak white navy beans in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight. Rinse thoroughly.
Place ham bone in a large pot with water to just cover. Bring to a boil and cook for at least 4 hours. Add onion, garlic, and pepper and simmer 1 hour more.
Remove ham bone; strip any meat from the bone and return it to the pot. Add chopped leftover ham, soaked and rinsed navy beans, split peas, and carrots and bring soup to a simmer. Cook until peas begin to break down, about 1 hour. Season with salt.
