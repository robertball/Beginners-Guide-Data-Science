Ingredients:
1 cup xylitol or Sucanat (It’s 100% sugar-free if you use xylitol. This technique works with regular sugar too, or evaporated cane juice or even brown sugar. So if you find yourself in the middle of baking something and you run out of powdered sugar, just make your own!)
optional 1-2 tsp arrowroot or cornstarch, to prevent clumping when stored

Directions:
Whir the ingredients in a blender. (I used a Vita-Mix.) It’ll smoke a little, but that’s ok. You should have powdered sugar in a matter of seconds!
