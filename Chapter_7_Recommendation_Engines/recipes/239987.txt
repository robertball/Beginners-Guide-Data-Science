Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 (14.5 ounce) package corn chips

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; add chocolate chips and cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted, 5 to 10 minutes.
Dip corn chips in the melted chocolate mixture until evenly coated and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate coated chips until chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Purchased this at a store that sold it as a seasonal item but due to it being unpopular, they stop selling them. I thought they were delicious and really wanted to try it out. The perfect salty sweet snack that's really quick to make.
