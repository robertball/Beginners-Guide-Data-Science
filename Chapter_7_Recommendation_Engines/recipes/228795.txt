Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups sifted whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 large egg
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 10 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Whisk 1 1/2 cups sifted whole wheat flour with baking soda, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a large bowl. Mix together mashed bananas, 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter, egg, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Gently fold banana mixture into dry ingredients just until moistened; do not overmix. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
Mix dark brown sugar with 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl, stirring until combined; mash 1 tablespoon unsalted butter into the mixture with a fork until streusel topping resembles crumbs. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
These moist muffins were created in my kitchen while trying to bake with whole wheat flour, which has more fiber than all-purpose flour.
