Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups teriyaki sauce, divided
6  pineapple rings
½ cup butter, melted
¾ cup packed brown sugar
¾ cup soy sauce
¾ cup unsweetened pineapple juice
6 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Place the chicken breast halves in a dish with the 1 1/2 cups of teriyaki sauce. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken breasts on grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 8 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. Brush with the remaining teriyaki sauce during the last 5 minutes. When almost done, place one pineapple ring on top of each breast, and brush with melted butter.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix the brown sugar, soy sauce, pineapple juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved. Serve with chicken for dipping!
