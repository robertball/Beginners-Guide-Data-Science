Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 pinch salt
Topping:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease an 11x14-inch baking dish.
Mix flour, pineapple, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, eggs, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl; pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
Combine 1 cup sugar, evaporated milk, and margarine together in a saucepan; bring to a boil for 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat and stir pecans and vanilla extract into sugar mixture.
Pierce the top of the cake with a toothpick and spread pecan topping over cake.

Great for a Mardi Gras-themed dinner party! I was a member of the Barksdale AFB Officers' Wive's gourmet club. This cake was made for one of our luncheons. Guaranteed Cajun!
