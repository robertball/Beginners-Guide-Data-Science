Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 teaspoons sesame oil
½ teaspoon dried rosemary
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried thyme
½ teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2  shallots, chopped
½ cup white Zinfandel wine

Directions:
Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Combine the sesame oil, rosemary, basil, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and mix well. Pour the herb mixture over the chicken breasts; cover and marinate 20 minutes.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts in the skillet and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Melt the butter in the skillet, and add the shallots. Cook the shallots until softened and browned, about 5-8 minutes.
Increase the heat to medium-high, and stir the wine into the chicken-shallot mixture. Cook all ingredients for 5 minutes longer, allowing the wine to reduce. Check the chicken for doneness: it is cooked when the juices run clear when pierced with a fork.

Description: 
Everybody loves this simple and delicious chicken. If you don't have white Zinfandel available, you can use another wine, whiskey, bourbon, or even balsamic vinegar. This recipe is very versatile!
