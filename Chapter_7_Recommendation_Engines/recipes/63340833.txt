Ingredients:
1 pound pasta (I use campanelle or penne)
1 pound Italian Sausage
1 can (15 oz.) pumpkin puree

1/2 onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, diced
1/2 cup half and half
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Brown sausage in large skillet on medium-high
While sausage is browning, cook pasta al dente in boiling water in a large pot
Add onion and garlic to browned sausage, stir, cook 3-4 minutes
Add pumpkin, chicken broth, half and half, sour cream, and spices
Stir well, cook 4-5 minutes until creamy
Pour sauce over cooked, drained pasta. Cook on medium-high for 4-5 minutes until heated through, stirring often.
Top with your favorite cheese and spices after plating. I use parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning

Description: 
This a great way to use pumpkin in your cooking rather than your baking. The flavor of the pumpkin doesn't come out very strong and if you didn't know what was in it, you probably wouldn't even realize it was pumpkin. But it makes a great creamy pasta sauce with a different type of flavor.
