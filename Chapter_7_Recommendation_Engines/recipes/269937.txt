Ingredients:
2 quarts beef stock
1 quart chicken stock
1/4 cup lime juice
1 medium onion, sliced
1/2 bunch cilantro, stems discarded
1 cup chopped fresh basil
2 ounces lemongrass paste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch ground white pepper, or to taste
1 pound T-bone steak, sliced lengthwise into 1 1/2-inch strips
1 pound shelled shrimp
1 pound dried rice noodles
1 pound bean sprouts, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine beef stock, chicken stock, lime juice, onion, cilantro, basil, lemongrass paste, red pepper flakes, cumin, garam masala, ginger, and white pepper in a stockpot. Add steak and shrimp; simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
While soup is cooking, prepare noodles about 30 minutes into the process. Bring a separate pot of water to a boil and add noodles. Boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain, rinse, and add to the soup. Stir in bean sprouts and season with salt.

Description: 
My friend Jessica has for years taunted me with her recipe for 'ghetto pho,' so called because of her love for cheap ingredients. A proper pho takes days to make, mostly because of the traditional French approach to making beef stock.
