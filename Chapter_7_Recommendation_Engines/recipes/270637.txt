Ingredients:
12 eggs
1/3 cup mayonnaise, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon coconut aminos (soy-free seasoning sauce)
1 tablespoon grated ginger
1 teaspoon nori furikake
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch nori furikake

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool in a bowl of ice water, about 5 minutes, and peel.
Cut boiled eggs in half using a sharp knife. Remove yolks and place in a large mixing bowl. Add mayonnaise, garlic, coconut aminos, 1 teaspoon nori furikake, salt, and pepper. Mix together until no lumps remain.
Use a spoon to fill each egg half with yolk mixture. Garnish with a sprinkling of nori furikake.
Serve right away or refrigerate 1 to 2 days.
