Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package dried rice noodles
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
1/2 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate
1/4 cup peanut oil
1 clove garlic, minced
4 eggs
1 tablespoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste (optional)
1 head lettuce, chopped, or as needed
2 tablespoons flaxseed oil
1/2 cup fresh bean sprouts, or to taste (optional)
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup chopped peanuts
1/2 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Place noodles in a bowl with enough hot water to cover; soak noodles until soft, about 10 minutes. Strain.
Combine sugar, water, lime juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, and tamarind in a large saucepan over medium heat. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; stir just until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add eggs; cook and stir until almost set, 2 to 3 minutes. Add strained noodles to egg mixture; stir in 1/2 of the sauce. Continue to cook and stir noodle mixture until hot, adding additional sauce as desired, 2 to 3 minutes more. Sprinkle paprika and chili powder over the noodles.
Layer lettuce on a serving dish or in individual bowls; drizzle with flaxseed oil. Place noodle mixture on lettuce; garnish with bean sprouts, green onion, cilantro, and peanuts. Serve with lime wedges.
