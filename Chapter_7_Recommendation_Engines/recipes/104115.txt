Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3/4 cup julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil
3 tablespoons oil reserved from sun-dried tomatoes
4 (3 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut into thirds
1 1/2 teaspoons Morton Lite SaltÂ® Mixture, divided
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup finely diced shallots
1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup dry vermouth*
2 (7 ounce) boxes uncooked spinach tortellini with cheese filling
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
In small bowl, combine garlic and reserved tomato oil. Brush chicken with half of oil mixture, then season with 1/2 teaspoon Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour to marinate.
In a large skillet, heat remaining garlic/oil mixture and add shallots. Saute over medium heat until shallots are soft and translucent; add chicken. Stir and cook until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Add mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, vermouth and remaining 1 teaspoon Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture. Saute chicken/vegetable mixture until mushrooms are crisp-tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Prepare tortellini according to package directions; substituting Morton Lite Salt(R) Mixture for salt. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid and drain. Gently toss tortellini and reserved cooking liquid with chicken mixture. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
