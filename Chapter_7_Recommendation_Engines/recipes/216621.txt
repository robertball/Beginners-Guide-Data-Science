Hummus from Scratch Recipe

Ingredients:
3/4 cup dry garbanzo beans
1/4 cup dried soybeans
1 bay leaf
1 onion, quartered
1 cup vegetable broth
3 cups water
2 cloves cloves garlic, crushed
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
black pepper to taste
1/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Rinse the garbanzos and soybeans, and place them in a pressure cooker along with the bay leaf and onion. Add vegetable broth and enough water to cover the beans by 1 inch (or follow the manufacturer's instructions for the minimum amount of liquid required).
Seal the lid and bring the pressure up to high; reduce the heat to low and cook, maintaining high pressure, for 1 hour. Allow the pressure to drop naturally.
Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Place the beans in the bowl of a food processor. Add the garlic, lemon juice, soy sauce, black pepper, and tahini; process until smooth. (You may add some of the cooking liquid for a thinner consistency.) Scoop the mixture into a bowl, and mix in the parsley.

Description: 
This is a great recipe made from dried garbanzo beans and soy beans. I cook my beans in a pressure cooker for an hour in a half water, half stock solution, but the old 'soak the beans overnight and simmer for two hours' method would also work.
