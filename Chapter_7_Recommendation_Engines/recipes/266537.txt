Ingredients:
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
4 cups baby spinach
1 nectarine, pitted and sliced
1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted
2 tablespoons thinly sliced red onion
2 tablespoons thinly sliced red bell pepper
1 (8.8 ounce) package halloumi cheese, sliced into 1/2-inch strips

Directions:
Whisk vinegar, olive oil, honey, mustard, salt, pepper, and basil together in a medium bowl. Set vinaigrette aside.
Toss 1/2 of the vinaigrette together with spinach, nectarine, almonds, red onion, and bell pepper in a large bowl.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add strips of halloumi and let cook until the undersides are golden brown and all liquid has been released and evaporates, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is golden brown, about 1 minute more.
Plate servings of salad, top with warm halloumi slices, and serve with remaining vinaigrette.
