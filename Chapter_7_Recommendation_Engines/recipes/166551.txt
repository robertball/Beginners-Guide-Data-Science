Ingredients:
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 (2 ounce) can anchovy fillets, minced
1 pound large sea scallops
1 large red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 large orange bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 red onion, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon minced lime zest
1 1/2 teaspoons minced lemon zest
1 pinch kosher salt and pepper to taste
8 sprigs fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Heat the olive oil and minced anchovies in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring as the oil heats to dissolve the anchovies. Once the anchovies are sizzling, add the sea scallops, and cook without moving the scallops for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, toss red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, red onion, garlic, lime zest, and lemon zest in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle pepper mixture onto the scallops and continue cooking until scallops have browned, about 2 minutes more. Turn scallops, stir the pepper mixture, and continue cooking until the scallops have browned on the other side, 4 to 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley sprigs to serve.
