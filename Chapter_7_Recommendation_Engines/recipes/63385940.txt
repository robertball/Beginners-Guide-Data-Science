Ingredients:
2 teaspoons canola oil
1 1/4 cups regular rolled oats
1/8 cup flax meal
1 teaspoon cinnamon
Pinch of salt
1/4 cup apple juice
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon brown sugar, optional when adding dried fruit

Directions:
1.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly grease baking sheet with canola oil (you may also use cooking-oil spray or line baking sheet with nonstick foil). In a medium bowl, combine the oats, flax meal, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well. In a small bowl combine the apple juice, maple syrup, honey, and optional brown sugar. Mix well.
2.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until the mixture is fully combined and moist. Spread the mixture on the greased baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
3.
Remove from the oven and stir, breaking the large chunks into smaller pieces. Bake for an additional 8 minutes or until crisp. Remove from oven and allow to cool. While still warm, stir to break up any remaining chunks. When completely cool, store the granola in an airtight container
