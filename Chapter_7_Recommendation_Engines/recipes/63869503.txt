Ingredients:
1 lbs. ground pork
2 lbs. ground beef
1 tbsp chopped chives
1 tbsp chopped thyme
1 tbsp chopped parsley
3 large eggs
1 1/3 cups finely ground Panko bread crumbs
2/3 cup whole milk
2 tbsp kosher salt
1 tbsp ground black pepper
olive oil
2 stalks celery, finely diced (about 2 stalks)
2 cups onion, finely chopped (about 2 medium onions)
3/4 cup olive oil
2 cups chicken or beef stock
10 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tbsp salted butter, room temperature

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (not convection bake)
Place Panko in food processor or blender and blend until it is a fine powder.
Place the pork, beef, chives, thyme, parsley, eggs, Panko, milk, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.
Heat a medium saute pan over medium-high heat and add tbsp olive oil.  When the oil is hot, add the celery and onion and cook, stirring, until softened (about 5-7 minutes).  Remove celery and onions from pan and let it cool.  When cool, add to meat mixture in bowl.
With clean hands, mix everything in the bowl.
Place meat mixture into two greased loaf pans.  Bake for 1-1.5 hours, or until a meat thermometer indicates an internal temperature of 155 to 160 degrees.  Remove meatloaf from oven and let it cool for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, for the sauce, combine oil and garlic in a pan and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until garlic is lightly browned.  Do not burn garlic or it will be bitter.  Remove the garlic from the oil and set aside (can save the oil for vinaigrettes).
Combine the chicken stock, butter, and cooked garlic in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook at a full boil for 35-40 minutes, until slightly thickened.  Mast the garlic with a fork.  Season with salt and pepper if desired.
Serve slice of meatloaf with teaspoon of sauce drizzled on it.
