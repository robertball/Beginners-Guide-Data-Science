Description: 
I was going to make Mozzarella Puffs, by Arreinia Grubb for my daughter's graduation party. Then I had a burst of inspiration, and wondered what would happen if I combined that recipe with bellepepper's Onion & Garlic Biscuit Flat Bread. I did a trial run, which I took to work - and my co-workers loved it! It was a compliment when Nancy was surpised to find out I'd actually made these yummy little cheese-filled bread puffs (=
