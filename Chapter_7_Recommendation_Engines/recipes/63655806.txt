Ingredients:
OREO COOKIE MINI CHEESECAKES
42 Oreos, 30 left whole and 12 coarsely chopped
2 pounds (32 ounces) cream cheese, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup sour cream
pinch of salt

Directions:
.Preheat oven to 275Â°. Line standard muffin pans with liners. Place 1 whole cookie in the bottom of each liner.
2.Beat cream cheese at medium speed using an electric mixer. Gradually add the sugar, beating until combined. Beat in vanilla.
3.Drizzle in eggs, a bit at a time. Beat in sour cream and salt. Stir in chopped cookies by hand.
4.Divide batter evenly among cookie-lined cups, filling each almost to the top. Bake, rotating pan halfway through, until filling is set, about 22 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Refrigerate at least 4 hours (or up to overnight). Remove from tins just before serving. Best served really cold! You can garnish with fresh whipped cream and crumbled Oreos if desired.
