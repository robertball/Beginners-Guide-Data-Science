Ingredients:
5 ounces mozzarella cheese
4 thick (wide) slices prosciutto
salt
freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
4 tablespoons olive oil
Mixed salad leaves

Directions:
Open cheese, drain and cut into four even chunks.
Wrap each chunk in a slice of prosciutto and secure with wooden cocktail sticks / toothpicks.
Heat olive oil in non-stick pan until very hot.
Season wrapped mozzarella and fry in oil until prosciutto is crisp and brown and cheese is starting to melt.
Arrange salad leaves on plate and top with mozzarella wraps.
Pour balsamic vinegar into pan to deglaze and scrape up any brown bits.
Pour over mozzarella and leaves.
Serve with either sweet chutney or preserves.
