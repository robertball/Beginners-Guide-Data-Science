Ingredients:
2 large tortillas (burrito size)
8 oz pre-cooked diced chicken
1 1/2 cups packaged cole slaw or bok choy
1/2 cup diced red pepper
1/2 cup diced yellow onion
1/4 cup cashew halves
1/3 cup ginger-sesame sauce or dressing
4 TBSP. prepared Thai peanut dressing/sauce (I use Tamori Peanut dressing found in my local grocery store in the salad dressing aisle)
1 Tbsp. Sesame oil
1 cup cooked Jasmine Rice

Directions:
Cook Jasmine rice according to package directions.  Meanwhile, in large skillet or wok heat seasme oil on high until hot.  Add red pepper, onion, cole slaw, and pre-cooked chicken to heated wok and stir fry for 2 or 3 minutes or until veggies are crisp/tender.  Reduce heat and add ginger-sesame sauce and cashews and continue stir frying to mix all flavors together an additional 2 minutes or so.  Remove from heat.  Warm tortillas in paper towel in microwave for 30 seconds until soft and pliant.  In each tortilla place 1/2 of the cooked rice spreading across the bottom half of the tortilla, then add 1/2 of the stir fried ginger-sesame slaw over that and drizzle each with 2 Tbsp. of the prepared Thai peanut dressing/sauce.  Roll up each burrito style starting at the bottom and folding the sides in as you go.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
A wrap that I created after trying something similar at a local Fresh City restaurant.  It's a taste of Thai wrapped up in a tortilla - chicken, stir fried ginger-sesame veggies, cashews, jasmine rice and peanut sauce.
