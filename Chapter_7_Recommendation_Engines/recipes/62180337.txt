Description: 
I started out following two different cookbook recipes for barbecue sauce when I was married over 20 years ago. After years of tweaking, I've finally gotten the recipe that works for me - and it's nothing at all like the originals! This sauce is meant to be used on ribs before grilling or baking or mixed with shredded pork or chicken for a sandwich to remember!
