Description: 
My husband's mom (sitta, Arabic for grandma) makes this soup, and the kids and we love it!  Very much a comfort food.  You really can't miss with measuring, less water more stew-like, more water soup-like . . . just add or subtract where you like! The kids eat theirs with parmesan cheese over the top. Enjoy!
