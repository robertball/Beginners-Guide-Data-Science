Ingredients:
1 cup butter flavored shortening
1 egg
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Mix together the shortening, egg, and confectioners' sugar.  Stir in vanilla, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda and flour.  Mix well.
Roll dough into 1 inch in diameter balls.   Place on cookie sheet.  Press down with a glass bottom dipped in sugar.  ( I have also used cookie stamps dipped into sugar.)
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes or just until edges are turning golden.  Let cool slightly before removing from the cookie sheet.

I love this recipe.  My mom made these when I was young.  They are light, crispy and seem to melt in your mouth.  Yum!
