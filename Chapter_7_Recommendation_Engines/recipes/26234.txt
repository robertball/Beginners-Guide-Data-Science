Ingredients:
4 eggs, separated
1 pound confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon anise oil
4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, whip egg whites until stiff. Beat in the yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the confectioners' sugar, baking powder and anise oil. Mix in the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each, until dough is fairly stiff. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness. Flour a springerle rolling pin and carefully roll it over the dough, leaving the imprints. Cut cookies along the lines of the design and place them 1 inch apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Let cookies stand overnight in a cool place to dry.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the bottoms are  lightly browned.

Description: 
My great-grandmother Schneider always baked these German cookies for the Christmas holidays. These cookies have a distinctive flavor that comes from anise oil. A springerle rolling pin is best, but one can use cookie presses. They are best if made about two weeks in advance and then stored in an airtight container before eating.
