Ingredients:
½ large onion or 1 entire small onion, thinly sliced
3 Tablespoons olive oil
6 sweet Italian sausages, casing removed
pinch of sale
1 pound frozen peas
8 oz of sliced button mushrooms
1 ½ - 2 cups of water
½ lb bow-tie pasta
1 teaspoon salt
Freshly Parmigiano Regiano cheese, grated, if desired

Directions:
1)	Over medium heat, place your onion and olive oil in a large pan and start simmering them together for a few minutes, until the onion takes on a fragrant smell.
2)	Add the sausages and salt and with a wooden spoon, break them down until they resemble ground meat. Cook for 5 minutes. (Sausage is pretty salty so you only need a pinch here)
3)	Add the peas and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.
4)	Add the mushrooms and water and cook all of the ingredients for an additional 20 minutes.  Lower the heat if the broth is drying up too quickly.
5)	Halfway through the cooking process, start cooking your bow-ties according to instructions but cook for 1-2 minutes less than the box indicates, about 9 minutes for bow-ties.
6)	Drain the bow ties and add it to the peas and sausage and cook everything together for a few minutes, until all the ingredients are well blended.
7)	Remove from the heat and place in serving bowl. If you wish, add freshly grated parmigiano cheese and a drizzle more olive oil, if it looks like it needs it. Enjoy as a first course or side dish.
