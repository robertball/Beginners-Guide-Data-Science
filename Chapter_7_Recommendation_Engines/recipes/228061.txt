Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
4 (1 inch) cubes salt pork
3 ribs celery, diced
1 Spanish onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
5 potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch cubes
5 cups clam juice
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon celery salt
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 pounds fresh clams, shelled and chopped
5 dashes Worcestershire sauce
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
salt and ground black pepper to taste
10 sprigs fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Melt butter in a stockpot over medium-high heat; cook and stir salt pork, celery, onion, and garlic in melted butter until softened, about 7 minutes. Add potatoes, clam juice, tarragon, celery salt, and bay leaves to the stockpot. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and place a cover on the pot. Cook at a simmer until potatoes are tender, about 35 minutes.
Stir clams into the soup and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce, heavy cream, dill, salt, and pepper; stir and cook another 7 minutes. Remove the pot from heat. Remove and discard bay leaves. Garnish with parsley to serve.
