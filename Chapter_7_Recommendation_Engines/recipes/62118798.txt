Teens LOVE this sandwich!
May substitute different cheeses, such as swiss or grated parmesan.  Turkey and pastrami are wonderful twists, as well!  Don't like ranch dressing?  Try Thousand Island instead!  Remove the dressing all together and use turkey with whole berry cranberry sauce..  The possibilities are endless!  Have fun!
