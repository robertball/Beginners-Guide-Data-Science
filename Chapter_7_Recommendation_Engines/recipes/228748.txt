Ingredients:
1 cup plain yogurt
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup feta cheese, crumbled
¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Mix yogurt, garlic, oregano, and black pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken to yogurt marinade, coating all sides. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from yogurt marinade; place on preheated grill. Cook for 6 minutes; flip and sprinkle with feta cheese. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 4 to 6 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with fresh parsley.
