Ingredients:
1 mango - peeled and diced
1/4 cup chopped red onion
1 serrano chile, minced
1/2 cup cilantro leaves, chopped
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon garlic pepper seasoning
4 fresh tilapia fillets

Directions:
For the mango salsa, combine the mango, red onion, serrano chile, cilantro, lime juice and salt in a glass bowl. Set aside.
For the tilapia rub, mix together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, curry powder and garlic pepper in a small bowl. Rub this mixture onto both sides of the fish fillets.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the fish for about 3 minutes on each side or until it flakes easily with a fork.
Serve with the mango salsa.
