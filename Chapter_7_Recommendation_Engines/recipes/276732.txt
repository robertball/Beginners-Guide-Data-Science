Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, or more to taste
1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 cup grated Romano cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season chicken with Cajun seasoning.
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the grill, wrap in foil, and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Melt butter into cream in a saucepan over medium-low heat, 2 to 3 minutes. Add Romano and Parmesan cheeses; stir in a figure-eight motion until cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir nutmeg into Alfredo sauce.
Place pasta and chicken into a serving dish. Drizzle with Alfredo sauce and garnish with parsley.
