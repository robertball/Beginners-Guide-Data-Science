Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Chinese 5 spice
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 quart oil for frying
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons water
1 1 lb package of cole slaw mix
8 (7 inch square) egg roll wrappers
2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Season pork with ginger, 5 spice  and garlic powder and mix thoroughly. Heat mixture in a medium skillet, stirring, until pork is cooked through and no longer pink. Set aside.
In another large skillet heat oil to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) or medium high heat. While oil is heating, combine flour and water in a bowl until they form a paste. In a separate bowl combine the cole slaw mix, soy sauce and reserved pork mixture. Mix all together.
Lay out one egg roll skin with a corner pointed toward you. Place  about a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the cabbage, carrot and pork mixture on  egg roll paper and fold corner up over the mixture. Fold left and right corners toward the center and continue to roll. Brush a bit of the flour paste on the final corner to help seal the egg roll.
Place egg rolls into heated oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels or rack. Put on serving plate and top with sesame seeds if desired.
