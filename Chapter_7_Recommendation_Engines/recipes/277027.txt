Description: 
They say that these Swedish chocolate balls, known as chokladbollar, are the first thing a Swedish child learns to make, and for good reason; they're easy to do, there's no baking required, and mixing the dough together makes for a fun activity. They sure beat snacking on a candy bar during the afternoon slump, as the fats and whole grain keep you satisfied much longer, while the coffee and cocoa provide the perfect pick-me-up.
