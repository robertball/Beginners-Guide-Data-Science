Ingredients:
2 Packages Active Baker's Yeast
1 Cup Warm Water
1 Cup Boiling Water
1 Cup Shortening
3/4 Cup Sugar
1 Teaspoon Salt
2 Whole Eggs (Beaten)
8 Cups Flour (All-Purpose)

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine boiling water, shortening, sugar, and salt. Allow to stand 3-4 minutes or until shortening is melted and sugar is dissolved.
Add 2 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough ( do not knead ).
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Turn dough onto a floured surface. Pinch off a piece and form a 2" ball. Repeat with remaining dough.
Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 350Â° for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
