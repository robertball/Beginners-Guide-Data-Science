Ingredients:
4 pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 small sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced
3 small apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Season pork chops on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and cook pork chops until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate and set aside.
Pour broth into the same skillet over medium heat and loosen brown bits that have stuck to the bottom. Add sweet potatoes to skillet. Layer apple slices on top. Place pork chops on top of apples and cover skillet. Remove from heat.
Place covered skillet in the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove lid and cook until pork is no longer pink in the center and sweet potatoes and apples are soft, about 10 minutes more.
