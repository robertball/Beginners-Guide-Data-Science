Ingredients:
3/4 c bulgar (cracked wheat)
Water
1 c whole wheat flour
1/2 c sugar
2 tsp salt
2 pkgs active dry yeast
About 5 c all-purpose flour
Butter
1 egg

Directions:
In small heat tolerant dish pour  3/4 c boiling water over bulgar.
Cover and let soak until water is absorbed, stirring occassionally. Set aside to cool.
In large bowl combine whole wheat flour, sugar, salt, yeast and 1 1/4 c flour.
In  1 quart saucepan over low heat, heat 2 c water and 1/2 c butter until very warm (120-130 degrees F. Butter does not need to melt completely).
With mixer at low speed gradually beat liquid into dry ingredients just until blended.
Increase speed to medium; beat two minutes, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula.
Gradually beat in room temperature egg and additinal 1 -2 flour  to make a thick sticky dough; continue beating  2 minutes, scraping bowl often.
With wooden spoon, stir cooled bulgar + 1 1/2c flour together to coat bulgar. Gradually add to dough.
Add just enough flour so dough begins to pull away from sides of bowl and starts to form a ball like mixture (dough will still be sticky and soft).
Turn dough onto well floured surface; cover with clean towel to let rest for 5-15 minutes.
Knead until dough is smooth and elastic; about 10 minutes, working in flour - just enough to keep dough from sticking to kneading surface.
Shape dough into a ball and place in greased large bowl, turning dough over so that top is greased.
Cover bowl with towel and let rise in a warm place away from draft, until doubled , about 2 1/2 hrs.  (Can cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight to rise).
Punch down dough.
Cut into 30 equal pieces; shape into balls and place in greased 15 1/2" x 10 1/2" open roasting pan.
Cover with towel; let rise in warm place until doubled; about 1 1/2 hrs.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Bake rolls 20 minutes until deep golden.  Remove from oven.
Melt 2 tbsp butter.  Brush over rolls
