Description: 
With rotisserie chickens so readily available, it's easy to buy a pre-roasted bird and pull the meat off the bones for use in recipes that would otherwise likely be too complicated for a weeknight meal. A little shredding and chopping is all it takes to serve up this delicious Thai-flavored chicken salad.
