How to make a whole cabbage with ham in a slow cooker (video)Jess ValentineContributing Writer Play VideoPrint this recipeCabbage and ham is a classic combination of flavors. The tender, sweet cabbage paired with the saltiness of the ham is a marriage meant to last forever. In the recipe below, we cook the whole head of cabbage on a bed of ham in the slow cooker.It takes only 10 minutes to prep, and in three hours you'll have the perfect side dish, or you can eat it as the main course, as I often do. The ham is mixed with onions and garlic. As the cabbage slowly cooks, it releases its natural juices, and the ham slowly simmers and makes a sort of sauce. The fresh lemon juice brightens the whole dish, while the butter adds just the right amount of nuttiness.ADVERTISEMENT COOKTOP COVESLOW COOKER WHOLE CABBAGE WITH HAM4 10 MINUTES 3 HOURS  3 HOURS, 10 MINUTES2 cups small-diced ham1 medium onion, small diced4 cloves garlic, minced1 tablespoon lemon juice teaspoon pepper1 head cabbage3 tablespoons softened butter teaspoon saltIn a 6-quart slow cooker, add ham, onion, garlic, lemon juice and pepper.
