Description: 
The idea of removing pesky bones before your bird makes its grand Thanksgiving entrance is worth considering. Not only do you get an impressive looking roast to wow the table, but carving is significantly easier. If you're worried about losing flavor, don't. This tastes virtually identical. Stuff with your favorite stuffing.
