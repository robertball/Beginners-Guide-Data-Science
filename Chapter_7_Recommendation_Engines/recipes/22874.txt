Ingredients:
3 eggs, room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons orange extract
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, whip eggs and sugar until light. Mix in the orange extract and oil. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the egg mixture along with the walnuts. Form dough into 4 logs and place them 3 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet; flatten slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and cool completely. Remove to a cutting board and slice each log into 1 inch wide diagonal slices with a serrated knife. Return the slices to the baking sheet, cut side down.
Return the slices to the oven and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until toasted.
