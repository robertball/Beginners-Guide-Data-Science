Ingredients:
2 lbs lean ground turkey
1 cup Italian bread crumbs
1 egg
Seasoning salt to taste (garlic & herb)
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp soy sauce
3 shakes of Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Mix all ingredients into a large bowl and form into medium patties just over an inch thick.
Cook in skillet on medium heat (use a VERY small amount of olive oil so they dont dry out but also don't get too soggy) until 160F internal temp. You can also sear them in a skillet first to get them started, then grill on a charcoal grill (heavy oiled grate) to finish it off for that extra flavor.
Do not just stick them on the grill - THEY WILL FALL THROUGH THE GRATE.
Melt swiss cheese on top when they are just about done, serve on a whole grain roll with lettuce, tomato and mayo and enjoy.
