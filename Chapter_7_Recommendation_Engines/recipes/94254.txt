Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 (7 ounce) cans lobster meat, diced
1 medium onion, diced
2 large stalks celery, diced
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
1/8 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1/8 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 bay leaf
1/8 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup cream sherry
1 quart heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.  Stir in the lobster, onion, celery, carrot, thyme, parsley, peppercorns, seasoned salt, bay leaf, and lemon juice.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat to soften the vegetables, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the flour and tomato paste; cook for another 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Pour in sherry and cook for a minute or two to cook off the alcohol.
Pour in the heavy cream, and bring to a simmer.  Reduce heat to low, simmer until the sauce has thickened, and will coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer, and discard the solids.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
