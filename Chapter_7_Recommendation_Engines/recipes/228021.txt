Description: 
An easy way to make individual instant oatmeal packets for a fast and hearty breakfast. The kids love to help! Add raisins, honey, or fruit as toppings if you like! My family of 7 will triple the recipe and put all the filled baggies into a gallon size resealable for storage. All the kids have to do in the morning is add water and any extra toppings and then microwave.
