Ingredients:
2 lbs chicken wings
1/3 cup flour
½ cup hot sauce
6 TBSPN unsalted butter
¼ tspn cayenne pepper
½ tspn garlic powder
½ TBSPN red wine vinegar
½ TBSPN worcestershire sauce
½ TBSPN honey
½ tspn salt and more for seasoning
Celery & carrots

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Pat chicken completely dry after cleaning then season chicken with salt. Dredge chicken with flour and lightly coat.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with non stick cooking oil.  Place wings in oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.
While wings are baking, melt butter in a medium sauce pan on a medium heat.  Add hot sauce, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, red wine vinegar, worcestershire sauce and honey and mix.   Let sauce simmer on low heat until wings are done.  Place wings in a large mixing bowl and pour buffalo sauce over them and toss until evenly coated. Slice carrots and celery and serve with blue cheese dressing on the side.
