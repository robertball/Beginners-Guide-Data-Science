1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 pound sweet potatoes, or more to taste, cut into cubes
6 ounces butternut squash cubes, or more to taste
1/4 cup thinly sliced yellow onion
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste

Directions:
Stir chicken broth, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, onion, ginger, garlic, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper together in a large pot. Bring to boil and cook over medium-high heat for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low and cook until squash and potatoes are soft and soup flavors have blended, about 3 hours.
Blend soup using an immersion blender, or in batches in a food processor, until smooth.
