gallon jug of pre-mixed margaritas for a party.

Needed are two fifths of tequila and measure out six cups (you should be left with about two ounces), and you'll need to buy one fifth of triple sec and measure out 2½ cups (this should leave you with about an ounce).Modified from: “gallon of margaritas” by Jeffery Morgenthaler
