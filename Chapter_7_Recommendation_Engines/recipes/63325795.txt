Ingredients:
2 whole chicken breasts, split
Salt and pepper
1/4 cup flour
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 green or red bell pepper, chopped
1 cup tomato sauce
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 tsp. oregano
rice, for serving

Directions:
Season the chicken with salt and pepper and dredge with flour. In a skillet, heat the oil and saute the onion, garlic and green pepper for 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables, set aside and brown the chicken breasts in the oil remaining in the pan. Return the vegetables to the pot and pour in the tomato sauce, broth and oregano. Cover the pan and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare enough rice for your family, to serve with the chicken.

Description: 
Quick and braised? Yes, it's possible, as you'll see in this weekday chicken supper that takes about as long to cook as the rice that you'll serve it with.--from Family Fun Magazine
