Description: 
This creamy sundried tomato pesto  will remind you of the tastes of Italy.  Its dimensions of flavor will transport your whole household to the finest Italian restaurant (at a fraction of the cost I might add).  This pasta boasts layered flavors of sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, fresh basil, fresh parsley, garlic, shallots and spices with the crunch of sauteed bell peppers and squash, fire roasted tomatoes and smooth al dente pasta all bathed in a luscious creamy sauce.   Now the ingredient list is long for this sauce, but I promise it comes together very easily.
