2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup oat bran
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 cup grated carrot
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/3 cup honey
3 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 lemons, zested

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 muffin tins.
Mix flour, oat bran, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl; form a large well in the center of the mixture. Add zucchini, papaya, carrot, applesauce, honey, eggs, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon juice to the well; stir to combine batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins, filling each 2/3 full.
