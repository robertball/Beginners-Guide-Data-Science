1 scant litre of filtered water

Thoroughly wash the mint and basil.
Add the mint, basil, and lime wheels to a litre sealable pitcher.
Pour the water into the pitcher.  Secure the seal and refrigerate for 24 hours.
The infusion is ready after 24 hours and can be topped up with fresh water for another 24 hours.
If left unopened, the water can last up to 1 week in the fridge. If you allow to infuse for this long though, the remains should be discarded.
