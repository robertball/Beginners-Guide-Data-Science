Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper (optional)
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons creme fraiche, divided

Directions:
Beat eggs in a bowl with an electric mixer until thick and frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in parsley, black pepper, salt, and white pepper.
Melt butter and olive oil together in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; reduce heat to low. Cook and stir egg mixture in hot butter and oil until eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Stir in 1 tablespoon creme fraiche; cook and stir until eggs are set, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and garnish with remaining creme fraiche.

Description: 
This is a wonderful, slightly creamy egg dish. The chopped parsley gives it tons of great color! If you can't find creme fraiche in your grocery store, just combine 1 tablespoon of buttermilk with 1 cup heavy whipping cream. Stir together and pour into a jar. Very lightly screw the lid on and let sit for 5 to 8 hours. This it can be refrigerated for 10 to 14 days.
