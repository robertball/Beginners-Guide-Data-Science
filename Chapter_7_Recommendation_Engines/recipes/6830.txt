Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 eggs
5/8 cup vegetable oil, divided
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 bananas, mashed
1 cup chopped strawberries
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease and flour loaf pan.
In a large bowl combine flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside.
In a medium bowl blend together with an electric mixer the oil, sugar, eggs and banana until well combined.
Add banana mix to the flour mix. Add the strawberries. Mix with a spoon until combined. Do not overmix.
Pour the mix into the loaf pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the loaf is well browned.  Note: Blueberries or chocolate chips are great in place of the strawberries.
