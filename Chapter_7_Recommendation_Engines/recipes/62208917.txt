Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1/4 tsp. salt
1 tsp vanilla
3 cups cornflakes
1 cup coconut
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
Beat egg whites until stiff. Slowly add sugar, salt and vanilla to egg whites and beat until mixed through. Stir in the rest of the ingredients. Drop by spoonful onto a well greased cookie sheet. I use parchment paper sprayed with Pam for easy removal. Cool completely before removing from pan as they will fall apart if too warm. Use a metal spatula.

Description: 
I grew up with Grandma making these special cookies. They are gluten free, fairly low fat and super delicious and easy! I couldn't find them anywhere on Allrecipes so decided to submit. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family does. Love you Grandma!
