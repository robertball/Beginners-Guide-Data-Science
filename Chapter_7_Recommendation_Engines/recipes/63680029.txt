Ingredients:
2 Tbs. unsalted butter
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups ketchup
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup steak sauce
2 Tbs. cider vinegar
1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
5 tsp. ancho chili powder

Directions:
In a small heatproof bowl, combine the ancho chili and boiling water. Let stand until the chili has softened, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 Tbs. of the liquid.
In a food processor or blender, combine the ancho chili, the reserved liquid, the olive oil and salt. Process until a thick, smooth paste forms. Place the paste and the chicken pieces in the barrel of a vacuum marinator and marinate for 30 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Let stand in the sealed marinator for 20 minutes more before grilling. If necessary, marinate the chicken in batches.
Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ketchup, water, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, vinegar, brown sugar and chili powder. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover partially and simmer until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
