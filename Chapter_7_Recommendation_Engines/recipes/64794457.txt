Ingredients:
3 c. Dry Pinto Beans
6 c. Water (to start; more as needed throughout cook time)
1/4 c. Corn Oil
2 tsp. Garlic Powder or Granulated Garlic
3 tsp. Salt

Directions:
Sort & rinse your beans. Place in a large pot or Dutch oven, and fill with water (about twice as much water as beans). Cover with pot lid.
Heat on high, bringing the beans to a boil.  Reduce to a medium-high, to maintain a healthy (but not full) boil for 2 hours. During this time, keep an eye on your water level, so you don't lose too much. Add water, as needed, to keep the water level sufficient. Keep water level around 2/3 of the way "full" in your pot.
After 2 hours, your beans will be in a brown, soupy broth. Don't worry about this. The juice/liquid is going to continue to cook down.
Add 3 tsp. salt; 2 tsp. Garlic Powder; stir. Here you can taste a bit of the broth to check for saltiness; adding additional salt, if desired. Add 1/4 c. Corn Oil.
Reduce heat, and simmer your beans for about 1.5 hours, or until they begin to want to stick. Be sure to stir occasionally during this time. Your beans will be in a thick, creamy sauce by now.
Remove from heat, and mash the beans until they are the consistency you enjoy.
Cook's Notes:
* Add water, as needed, throughout the cooking process.
* If storing for next day, (or leftovers), the beans will get thick. If is fine to use a bit of water or milk to loosen them up, if you find the need to.
