Ingredients:
PANNA COTTA:
1 (.25 ounce) package plain gelatin
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
1/4 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1/4 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
CARAMEL:
1 cup Sugar In The Raw®
4 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine gelatin with 3 tablespoons cool water and let sit for 5 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, combine cream, pumpkin, sugar, stevia, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Bring just to a simmer, take off heat, and whisk in vanilla and gelatin.
Divide panna cotta mixture between 6 small cups or glasses using 1/2 cup mixture per serving. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
For the caramel, combine sugar and 1/3 cup water in a large saucepan and stir constantly over medium-low heat until sugar is completely dissolved. Increase heat to medium and cook until syrup is a very dark amber color.
Take pan off heat and stir in butter, cream, and salt until smooth. Let cool to room temperature.
Serve panna cotta topped with caramel and sprinkled with pecans. Cover and refrigerate any leftover caramel.
