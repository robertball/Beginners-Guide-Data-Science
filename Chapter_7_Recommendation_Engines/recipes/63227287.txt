Ingredients:
Ingredients
1 cup warm water
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cilantro
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Add ingredients in the order shown and turn machine on dough cycle.
When finished, let the dough rest from 5 to 30 minutes. The longer it rests, the thicker the crust.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. Spray a large pizza pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place dough on pan and add your choice of pizza toppings.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.
