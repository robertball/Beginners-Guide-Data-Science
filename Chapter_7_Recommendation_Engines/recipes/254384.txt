Ingredients:
3 large peaches, peeled and pitted
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle caffeinated citrus-flavored soda (such as Mountain DewÂ®)
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut peaches into 16 crescent-shaped slices.
Unroll crescent roll dough on a flat work surface and separate into 16 triangles. Place a peach slice at the base of each triangle and roll up to enclose in the dough. Arrange turnovers in a baking pan.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Pour evenly over the turnovers in the baking pan. Pour citrus-flavored soda over the turnovers. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until turnovers are golden brown and liquid is bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe originally uses apples, but with peach season in full swing here in the Ozarks, these sweet little tangy fruits made the perfect turnovers. Add a dash of cinnamon and pair with homemade vanilla ice cream and your friends and family will be begging for more.
