Ingredients:
3 cups flour, self rising
1 cup cornstarch
3 tablespoons seasoned salt
2 tablespoons paprika
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 package Italian Salad Dressing Mix
1 package Onion Soup Mix
1 package Spaghetti Sauce Mix
3 tablespoons sugar
3 cups corn flakes, crush slightly
2 eggs, well beaten
1/4 cup cold water
4 pounds chicken, cut up

Directions:
Combine first 9 ingredients in large bowl.
Put the cornflakes into another bowl.
Put eggs and water in a 3rd bowl.
Put enough corn oil into a heavy roomy skillet to fill it 1" deep.  Get it HOT!
Grease a 9X12X2 baking pan.  Set it aside.  Preheat oven to 350ยบ.
Dip chicken pieces 1 piece at a time as follows:
1-Into dry coating mix.  2-Into egg and water mix.  3-Into corn flakes.  4-Briskly but briefly back into dry mix.  5-Drop into hot oil, skin-side-down and brown 3 to 4 minutes on medium high.  Turn and brown other of each piece.  Don't crowd pieces during frying.
Place in prepared pan in single layer, skin-side-up.  Seal in foil, on 3 sides only, leaving 1 side loose for steam to escape.
Bake for 35-40 minutes removing foil to test tenderness of chicken.  Allow to bake uncovered 5 minutes longer to crisp the coating.
