Ingredients:
2 tablespoons active dry yeast
2 pinches white sugar
1/2 cup warm water
6 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 cups hot water
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Dissolve yeast and 2 pinches white sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
Mix 4 cups flour, hot water, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; pour yeast mixture into the flour mixture and mix. Add remaining flour, one cup at a time, mixing well between additions. Continue to work the mixture until you have a dough; divide dough into 2 halves. Divide each half into 12 long bread sticks and arrange onto prepared baking sheets.
Pour melted butter and sprinkle Parmesan cheese and garlic powder over the breadsticks.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 13 minutes.
