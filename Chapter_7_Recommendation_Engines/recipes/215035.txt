Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 teaspoon dried savory
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
1/2 cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
1 lemon, zest grated
1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 tomato, seeded and chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and stir in the savory, parsley, red pepper flakes, and chicken bouillon granules until the granules dissolve. Pour in the couscous, stir to combine, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Cover and remove from heat. Let cool. Drain off any excess liquid remaining.
Place the cooled couscous in a salad bowl, and lightly combine with lemon zest, almonds, celery, onion, tomato, and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before refrigerating until cold, at least 1 hour.
