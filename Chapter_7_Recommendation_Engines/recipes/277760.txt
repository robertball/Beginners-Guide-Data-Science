Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups water
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup coconut oil, softened
2 tablespoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix flour, water, peanut butter, coconut oil, and baking powder together in a large bowl until blended.
Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to approximately 3/8-inch thick. Cut into squares or use cookie cutters to make fun shapes. Place treats 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
