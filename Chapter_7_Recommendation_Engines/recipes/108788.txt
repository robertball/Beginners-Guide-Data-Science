Ingredients:
6 potatoes, sliced
1/4 cup diced onion
2 tablespoons cold margarine
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire.
Cut 2 lengths of heavy duty foil approximately 18 inches square, placing one on top of the other for strength.  Spray top one with non-stick spray. Spread potatoes on foil leaving plenty of room to fold up later. Scatter the onion over potatoes; slice the margarine over the potatoes; layer the Parmesan, mozzarella, and Cheddar cheeses over the potatoes; season with salt and pepper. Bring opposite edges of foil together and seal.
Place the packet directly onto your campfire and cook until the potatoes are soft, about 35 minutes.
