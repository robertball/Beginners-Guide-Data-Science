Ingredients:
Bourbon Glaze
1 1/2 cup of hot coffee
¼ cup of maple syrup
3 tablespoons of dark brown sugar (packed)
½ teaspoon instant espresso powder
1/3 cup bourbon
2 tablespoons of butter
salt and pepper
Sweet Potato:
5 lbs of sweet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1 ½” cubes
4 eggs
4 tablespoons of butter, chilled cut into ¼” cube
½ cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Stir coffee, maple syrup, sugar, and espresso powder in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring mixture to boil and cook until reduced by half 6-7 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and add bourbon and butter.  Return pan to heat and reduce heat to medium, simmer for 40-45 minutes, until mixture is thick.  This will thicken as it cools.
Set aside.
Directions for Sweet Potato:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter a 13 x 9” baking dish.
In a stockpot add sweet potatoes and enough water to cover and boil cooking about 12 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork.
Drain  and return to pan, mashing sweet potatoes until smooth.  (An immersion blender or a regular blender is a great way to mash potatoes.
Once mashed add eggs and glaze stirring until evenly                                                                                                                                  blended.
