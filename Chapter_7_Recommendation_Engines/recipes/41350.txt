Ingredients:
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine
1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 2-inch strips
1/4 cup browning sauce
1 1/3 cups reduced-sodium beef broth, divided
1 cup white wine or additional reduced-sodium beef broth

2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup (8 ounces) fat-free sour cream
6 cups cooked no-yolk noodles

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, saute mushrooms and onion in butter until tender. Remove and set aside. In the same skillet, cook the chicken with browning sauce until browned. Add 1 cup broth, wine or additional broth, ketchup, garlic and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
Combine flour and remaining 1/3 cup broth until smooth; stir into chicken mixture. Add reserved mushroom mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Reduce heat to low. Stir in sour cream; heat through (do not boil). Serve over noodles.
