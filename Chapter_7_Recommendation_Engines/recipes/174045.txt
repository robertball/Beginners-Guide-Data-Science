Ingredients:
1/2 cup coarsely chopped sweet onion
1/4 cup coarsely chopped garlic
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
3 cups fresh corn kernels, roughly mashed
1 cup chopped fresh chives
1/2 cup frozen peas
1/4 cup white rice flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup chopped raw shrimp (optional)
3 tablespoons thinly sliced red chile pepper (optional)
4 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Combine the onion, garlic, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and sweetened condensed milk in the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse 4 to 5 times, until the mixture forms a smooth paste.
Scoop the spice paste into a large bowl, and stir in the corn, chives, peas, rice flour, all-purpose flour, egg, water, shrimp, and red chile pepper. Mix together to form a thick batter.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drop batter about 1/4 cup at a time into the hot oil, and fry 2 to 3 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove the fritters from the hot oil, and drain on paper towels.
