Ingredients:
Pie Crust
2 cups Robin Hood® Original All Purpose Flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup Crisco® All Vegetable Shortening
1 egg
2 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon white vinegar
Filling
3 egg yolks
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1 (300 ml) can Eagle Brand® Regular or Low Fat Sweetened Condensed Milk
1/2 cup lemon juice
Meringue
3 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Pastry: Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl. Cut room temperature shortening into flour with pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is uniform and shortening resembles large peas. Beat egg, water and vinegar together. Pour all liquid evenly over flour mixture. Stir with fork until all of the mixture is moistened.  Divide dough in half and shape each into a ball. Flatten each into a circle about 4" (10 cm). Wrap and chill 15 minutes for easier rolling. If not using the second ball of dough wrap well in plastic wrap and place in freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month.
Roll dough on lightly floured board to 1/8" thick (0.3 cm). Transfer to 9" (23 cm) pie plate. Flute edges. Line with foil and pie weights. Chill for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and pie weights and continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes longer, until golden. Cool completely prior to filling.
Reduce oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).
Filling: Beat yolks in a large mixing bowl. Whisk in lemon zest, sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice. Pour into cooled baked crust. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven.
Increase oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy; gradually add sugar beating until stiff peaks form but not dry. Spread meringue on top of hot pie, carefully sealing to edge of crust.
Return to oven and bake for 10 minutes or until meringue is golden brown. Cool, chill before serving if desirable.
