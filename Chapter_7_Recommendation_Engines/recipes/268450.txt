Ingredients:
4 cups chopped Granny Smith apples
2 cups fresh cranberries
2 cups white sugar
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
2 fluid ounces brandy, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup white sugar, or to taste
3/4 cup butter, cut into pats

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly grease a shallow, 2- to 3-quart baking pan.
Combine apples, cranberries, 2 cups white sugar, and brown sugar in the prepared baking pan. Drizzle brandy over the mixture.
Combine rolled oats, flour, almonds, walnuts, and 1/4 white sugar in a bowl and toss together. Sprinkle mixture evenly over apples in the baking pan to keep it from burning and allow it to cook evenly. Place pats of butter on top to help with the browning process and give flavor.
Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes. Turn baking pan around in the oven to ensure the crumble cooks evenly. Continue baking until lightly browned, 15 to 30 minutes more.
