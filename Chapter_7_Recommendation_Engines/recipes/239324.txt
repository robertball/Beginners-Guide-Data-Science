Ingredients:
6 Red Delicious apples - peeled, cored, and cut into cubes
4 Asian pears - peeled, cored, and cut into cubes
1/2 cup apple cider
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir apples, Asian pears, and apple cider together in the skillet until the fruit is mushy, about 10 minutes.
Smash the apples and pears with the back of a wooden spoon until no large chunks remain; continue cooking until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes more.
Stir sugar and cinnamon into the sauce; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely, 5 to 7 minutes more.
