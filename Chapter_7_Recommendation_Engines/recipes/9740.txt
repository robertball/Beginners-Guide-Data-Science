Ingredients:
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup almonds
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 330 degrees F.  Grease cookie sheets.
Cream together butter or margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.  Stir in eggs and vanilla.
Sift together flour and salt and add to butter mixture.  Stir well.
Chop almonds to very fine pieces and stir into mixture.
Drop by teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets about 5 inches apart.  Bake for 8 minutes, or until edges begin to brown.
As soon as cookies are cool enough to handle, roll each one around the handle of a wooden spoon or pencil.  If cookies become too brittle, reheat for a few seconds.
