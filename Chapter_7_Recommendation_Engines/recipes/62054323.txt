https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb. whole, small, flat onions
3/4 cup walnuts or pecans
1-2 tbs. honey
1-2 tbs. butter
very small bunch fresh Italian sage or any other sweet, fresh herb such as tarragon or maggioram (if desired)
black pepper (if desired)
salt to taste

Directions:
Boil the onions in lightly salted water for 15-20 minutes, or just until cooked through. Poke them with a knife; if they're soft in the middle, they're done.
While the onions are cooking, toast the walnuts under a 375 degree oven for 5-8 minutes, or until fairly warm.
Drain the onions.
Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Toss in the sage. As the sage wilts, add the walnuts and the onions. Stir lightly for about 1-2 minutes until the onions and walnuts have been dressed in the butter and start to sizzle. Drizzle on just enough honey to coat, and stir for one more minute. Salt to taste.
