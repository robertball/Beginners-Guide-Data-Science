Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1 bunch green onions, chopped, or to taste
2 egg whites
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or to taste
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon ground dried chipotle pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Avocado Sour Cream Spread:
1 ripe avocado
1/2 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Combine ground chicken, green onions, egg whites, cilantro, jalapenos, 1 1/2 tablespoons sour cream, chipotle pepper, salt, and pepper in large bowl. Mix until sticky and difficult to handle.
Shape ground chicken mixture into patties. Combine bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Coat patties lightly with seasoned bread crumbs.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Mash avocado and 1/2 cup sour cream together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Spread over chicken patties.

Description: 
Threw them together on a busy day and they were so good I wanted to share. Recommended to be topped with iceberg lettuce, thin sliced tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, and hot salsa, or better yet, hot picante.
