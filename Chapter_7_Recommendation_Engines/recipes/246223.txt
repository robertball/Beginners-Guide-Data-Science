Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 dried bay leaf
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
6 potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
4 cups chicken broth
3 cups water
1 cup chopped canned tomatoes with juice
2 teaspoons garlic and herb seasoning (such as SpikeÂ®)
1 (10 ounce) package chopped frozen spinach

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and bay leaf; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, curry powder, turmeric, and coriander; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir potatoes, chicken broth, water, canned tomatoes, and seasoning into the pot; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are mostly cooked through, about 15 minutes. Add spinach; stir well to combine. Mash some of potatoes to thicken soup. Continue cooking until potatoes are soft, about 10 minutes more.
