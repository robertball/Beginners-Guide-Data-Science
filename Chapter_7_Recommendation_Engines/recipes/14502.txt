1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 large clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Stir soy sauce, rice wine, ginger, and garlic together in a shallow dish. Place tuna in the marinade, and turn to coat. Cover dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Remove tuna from marinade and discard remaining liquid. Brush both sides of steaks with oil.
Cook tuna on the preheated grill until cooked through, 3 to 6 minutes per side.

Description: 
Delicious right off the grill! Take care not to overcook the steaks, as tuna can quickly become quite dry.
