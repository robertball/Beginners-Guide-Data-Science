2 tablespoons dried rosemary
2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Spread the mixed nuts into a single layer on the lined baking sheet.

Description: 
This is a great upscale version of the same ol' bar nuts that you get served at every bar. This is a great party food. You can make these ahead of time. Just spread back out on wax paper until they are cooled and place back in to mixed nut jar.
