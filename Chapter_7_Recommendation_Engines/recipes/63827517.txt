Ingredients:
1 lb shrimp (31-40/lb, raw, unpeeled, deveined)
1/2 cup white wine
2 cloves garlic - finely chopped
300 g linguine pasta
3 tbsp lemon juice and rind
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp whipping cream
100 g Parmesan cheese - grated
1 tbsp Italian parsley - finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Prep the shrimp by placing it in cold water. Remove the shell while leaving the tail on.
Melt the butter and add the garlic and shrimp, saute for 3-4 minutes, add the lemon rind, cream, wine, 1/2 of the parsley and salt to taste.  Saute another minute, remove from heat and set aside.
Cook pasta "al dente", drain but retain 1/2 cup of the water which the pasta was cooked in.  Place the pasta back in the cooking pan on medium heat and add the sauce, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese and the pasta water if the mixture is too dry.  Toss until all the liquid is absorbed.
Transfer into a serving platter, top with remaining Parmesan cheese, sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with the remaining lemon rind.
