Ingredients:
3 (6 inch) corn tortillas
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup fresh poblano chile pepper, seeded and minced
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons margarine
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/8 cup cooked and chopped chicken
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup fresh poblano chile pepper, seeded and chopped
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into strips and toasted for garnish

Directions:
Cut the corn tortillas into ninths, place into a food processor and chop until fine. Add the flour, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper. Blend until tortillas become the consistency of cornmeal. Set aside.
In a large pot over medium heat, combine the oil, onion, 1/2 cup poblano chile peppers and garlic and saute for 5 minutes, or until onions are translucent. Add the butter or margarine and allow it to melt. Add the ground tortilla mixture to the pot and stir well with a wire whip to form a roux. (Note: Do not let it burn.)
While stirring, slowly add the chicken stock. Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the pot. Add the half-and-half, bring to a slow simmer and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. (Note: Do not let soup come to a hard boil.)
Turn off heat and allow soup to cool slightly. Stir in the chicken before serving. Top each serving with the cheese, poblano chile peppers and tortilla strips for garnish.
