Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
5 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water

Directions:
In large bowl, combine flour, eggs and salt.  Add water a little at a time to form a soft dough.
Boil 2 quarts of water in a large pot.  Squeeze dough out into the water using noodle or fruit press or by pressing through a colander with large holes.  When noodles float to the top of the water, they are done (3 to 4 minutes).  Serve as a side or main dish.
