Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas
4 pods fresh jackfruit
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut

Directions:
Blend bananas, jackfruit pods, and cream in a blender until jackfruit is mostly chopped into small pieces.
Combine coconut milk and sugar together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir the banana mixture into the coconut milk mixture. Stir vanilla extract and sea salt into coconut milk mixture.
Pour 1/2 of the coconut milk-banana mixture into a blender. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend until smooth. Pour blended mixture into a long rectangular pan or glass tray. Repeat blending the remaining coconut-banana mixture until smooth; pour into the pan. Stir flaked coconut into pureed coconut-banana mixture. Cover pan with a lid or aluminum foil and place in the freezer, stirring 1 time every hour, for 5 hours.
