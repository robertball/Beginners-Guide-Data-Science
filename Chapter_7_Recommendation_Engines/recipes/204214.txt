Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup flat leaf parsley
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, whole
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
6 slices Wonder® Classic White Sandwich Bread, crusts removed
1/4 cup margarine or butter, melted
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Place beans, parsley, lemon juice, whole garlic cloves and oregano in a food processor.
While the food processor is running, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Set bean dip aside.
Slice each slice of bread into thirds.  Place bread strips on a baking sheet. Add 1 minced garlic clove to melted butter and brush on bread.  Bake for 5 to 6 minutes.  Turn bread sticks and brush with butter.  Sprinkle bread sticks evenly with Parmesan.  Bake 5 to 7 additional minutes or until toasted.
Serve warm bread sticks with bean dip.

Wonder® bread
Description: 
You can feel good about serving this appetizer. Because now, just two slices of Wonder Classic White Sandwich Bread have as much calcium as an eight ounce glass of milk. And that means, these garlic sticks are not only good, they're good for you, too.
