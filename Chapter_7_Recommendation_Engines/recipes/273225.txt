Ingredients:
3 small ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup natural peanut butter
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
3 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups rolled oats
3/4 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Whisk together bananas, vegetable oil, peanut butter, applesauce, soy milk, brown sugar, eggs, ginger, and almond extract in a large bowl.
Stir whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into the bowl with the banana mixture. Fold in oats and sesame seeds. Scrape the bowl using a rubber spatula to thoroughly combine.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 4 or 5 cookie sheets, or bake in batches.
Use a small cookie scoop or spoon to drop tablespoon-sized mounds of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes.
