Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
4 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup regular grits, uncooked
1 egg, well beaten
1 1/2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or more to taste
1 pinch paprika, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Bring water and salt to a boil in a pot over high heat. Add grits, reduce heat to low, and let simmer until tender, about 30 minutes.
Pour grits into a large mixing bowl. Add beaten egg slowly, followed by 1 1/4 cups Cheddar cheese, milk, Worcestershire sauce, butter, pepper, garlic powder, and hot sauce. Mix thoroughly and pour into the prepared dish. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese on top and sprinkle lightly with paprika for coloring. Cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until thickened and cheese is melted, about 1 hour, uncovering the last 10 minutes to let a crust form on top.

Description: 
A Southern tradition, creamy cheese grits with a zip of spice makes for a perfect side dish to barbecue, or for a holiday get together. They were always on the table at my mother-in-law's house. A real family tradition.
