Description: 
So why is this meatloaf evil?? Because you can't ever have just one slice... I dare you! After cooking for 30 years I finally have a meatloaf I enjoy serving. I've cooked meatloaves for years - always trying a different tweak here or there, and none has turned out finer than this one! Great meatloaf to make meatloaf sandwiches the following day for lunches too with a little ketchup and mayonnaise!
