Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated crusty French loaf dough
6 ounces thinly sliced deli ham
6 green onions, sliced
8 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Unroll dough on a greased baking sheet. Place ham over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges; sprinkle evenly with onions, bacon and cheese. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Pinch seams to seal and tuck ends under. Place seam side down on baking sheet.
With a sharp knife, cut several 1/4-in.-deep slits on top of loaf. Bake at 350 degrees F for 26-30 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm.

Description: 
This pretty swirled sandwich loaf from Pat Raport of Gainesville, Florida is fast, easy and versatile. 'Fill it with anything your family likes,' she suggests. 'Try sliced pepperoni and provolone cheese, or anchovies and ripe olives if you're feeling adventurous.'
