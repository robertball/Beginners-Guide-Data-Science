Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped (reserve marinade)
1 bunch green onions, chopped
9 eggs, beaten
1 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, grated
14 saltine crackers, crumbled
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved marinade from the artichoke hearts in a large skillet. Cook and stir green onions in hot marinade until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir cooked green onions, eggs, Cheddar cheese, saltine crackers, parsley, garlic, hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is puffy and no longer moist, about 40 minutes; cool slightly before cutting into squares.

Description: 
This rich, delicious, and easy-to-make appetizer can be served warm or cool. I sometimes use grated low-fat cheese and find that it is just as tasty and less greasy. Dried parsley works, too.
