Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried white navy beans
1 (16 ounce) package 12-bean soup mix
2 tablespoons butter, or to taste
2 large onions, chopped
4 carrots, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
4 smoked ham hocks, or more to taste
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
2 (6 ounce) cans chopped green chiles
2 tablespoons chicken soup base
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
water to cover

Directions:
Rinse navy beans and 12-bean mix thoroughly and set aside.
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; saute onions, carrots, and celery until onions are clear and soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix bean mixture, ham hocks, tomatoes, beer, green chiles, chicken soup base, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; add enough water to fill the pot. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are soft, 6 to 8 hours.

Description: 
The great thing about beans are the endless variations. After years of experimenting, I've settled on this recipe, which is loaded with flavor. I like to put mine in the refrigerator overnight, then scrape the fat off the top before reheating. Serve with a good, crusty bread.
