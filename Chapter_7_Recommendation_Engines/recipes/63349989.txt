Ingredients:
CAKE:
1 cup honey
1 ½ cups sugar
½ cup vegetable oil
1 Tbsp. jam, any kind
3 large eggs
4 cups flour
1 Tbsp. baking powder
¼ tsp. baking soda
½ cup coffee or tea
1 tsp. cinnamon
½ tsp. ground cloves
CHOCOLATE GLAZE:
¼ cup cocoa
½ cup sugar
1 tsp. flour
3 ½ Tbsp water
¼ lb. margarine
1 Tbsps Brandy

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly grease two 8" x 3" loaf pans.
Mix together the honey, sugar, oil, jam, eggs, flour, baking powder, soda, coffee (may be made
from instant), cinnamon, cloves and orange rind.
Spread batter evenly into the two bread pans.  Bake 1 hour at 325® or until knife comes out clean. Don’t over bake.  Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.
Glaze: Mix cocoa, sugar, flour and water in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly.  Cook and stir until mixture is smooth and thick, about 8 minutes.
Add in the margarine and brandy.  Beat with a spoon or whisk to thicken as it cools.
Spread over top of cooled honey cakes.  Note: wait till glaze is fully cool or even stick in the fridge for a bit - the glaze is much easier to spread when cooled (unless you like that runny drippy look!)

Description: 
This is my mother's traditional honey cake, made every year for the Jewish new year Rosh HaShanah. We eat honey cake in order to have a sweet new year.  I LOVE the glaze for this especially - the cake is a little dry - best served with tea - but I could eat the glaze with a spoon!
