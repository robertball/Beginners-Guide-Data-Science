Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon ground coriander, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground cumin, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground red chile pepper, or to taste
salt to taste
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup chana dal
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
Breading:
2 eggs
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon ground red chile pepper, or to taste
salt to taste
1/4 cup bread crumbs, or as needed (optional)
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Heat a stockpot over medium heat; add ground beef. Stir in garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon ground red chile, and salt to taste. Add water and dal; simmer until meat is fully cooked and all water has evaporated, 30 to 35 minutes.
Blend beef and dal mixture together using an immersion blender in the stockpot. Add 1/2 cup cilantro; blend to combine. Roll spoonfuls of beef and dal mixture into into walnut-sized balls; shape into smooth flat patties.
Whisk eggs, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon ground red chile, and salt to taste together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each patty into egg mixture, then roll in bread crumbs.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in a single layer until golden brown and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes per side.
