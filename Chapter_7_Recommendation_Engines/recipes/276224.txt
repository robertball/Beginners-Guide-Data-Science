Ingredients:
Meatballs:
3/4 cup plain bread crumbs
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 large onion, grated
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons minced garlic (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
3 pounds 85% lean ground beef
Gravy:
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons minced onion
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups beef broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 dash cayenne pepper
1 dash white pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a jelly roll pan.
Combine bread crumbs, milk, eggs, onion, ginger, salt, nutmeg, garlic, and black pepper in a mixing bowl. Let stand until bread crumbs absorb milk, about 5 minutes. Stir until just mixed and add ground beef. Mix until well blended. Shape mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place on the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 18 minutes. Set meatballs aside.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in flour and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Slowly add broth; cook and stir gravy until smooth and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Blend in cream, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.
Gently stir cooked meatballs into gravy and heat through, but do not boil, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Both of my parents are Norwegian. Growing up, my mom used to make these meatballs. Later in life, my dad took over the meal prep, and he became a great cook.  My mom did a good job, but my dad perfected the recipe. I think of him every time I make them now.
