Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cut into 1/2"-3/4" pieces
1 large onion, diced
1 poblano pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 oz) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 oz) can navy beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 oz) can great northern beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 oz) can large butter beans, drained and rinsed
3/4 cup barbecue sauce
1/2 cup molasses
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until brown and crispy, stirring often.  Drain.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients including bacon.  Stir to combine.
Transfer bean mixture to either a greased 9x13 baking dish or the crock of a slow cooker.
If baking, heat oven to 375 degrees F and bake, covered, for 1 hour.
If using slow cooker, cook for 4-6 hours on low, then switch to high, and cook uncovered for 1 more hour to thicken sauce.
