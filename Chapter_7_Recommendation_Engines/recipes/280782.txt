Description: 
We are building a better bacon dog by using 2 smaller hot dogs instead of 1 larger one, which we will merge together using the latest bacon-binding technology. Other than some potato chips, I think potato salad is the ultimate hot dog side dish, so go ahead and serve this up with some.
