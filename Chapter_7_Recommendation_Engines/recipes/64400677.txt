Ingredients:
1/2  cup cornflour or polenta. (the original recipe says cornmeal)
1 1/4 cups of water
1 to 2 tsp of lemon juice
1/2 tsp salt (I used salt herbs. )

Directions:
Place the cornflour or polenta in a pan with 1 cup of water. Cook until mixture is thick and smooth. Stir continuously to avoid lumps. Pour mixture in food processor or blender. I used a blender. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of water and 1 tsp of lemon and the salt. Blend or process until it reaches a smooth consistency. If you need to add more water you can. Taste, and if you prefer add another teaspoon of lemon juice. Store in a container and refrigerate. It should thicken once it has been in the fridge.
