Ingredients:
1 (1/2 pound) sirloin steak, cut into bite size strips
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 sweet onion, chopped
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1 zucchini, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup steak sauce

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate.
Place the steak strips on a piece of foil large enough to hold the meat and some vegetables. Layer with the red, green and yellow peppers, chopped onion, cherry tomatoes and chopped zucchini. Dot with butter, and drizzle with steak sauce. Fold edges of foil to seal the packet well.
Grill over medium high heat for 45 to 60 minutes. About halfway through cooking, flip the packet, being careful not to puncture it. (Note: Be careful when opening foil packet as the steam that escapes will be very hot.)
