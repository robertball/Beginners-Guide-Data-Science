Ingredients:
2 cups diced thick-cut applewood-smoked bacon
1 medium onion, chopped
3 large white potatoes, scrubbed and chopped into 1/2-inch cubes
2 (15 ounce) cans cream-style corn
1 (11 ounce) can sweet corn, drained
2 cups water
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups half-and-half
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Stir in onion and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until bacon and onion are evenly browned, about 5 minutes more. Drain bacon grease, leaving only 2 to 3 tablespoons in the skillet.
Stir in potatoes to bacon-onion mixture. Cover, reduce heat to low and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Transfer mixture to a medium-sized pot. Add cream-style corn, sweet corn, and water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Warm half-and-half gently in a small pan over medium-low heat just until bubbles begin to appear. Remove from heat and mix into stew until desired consistency is reached. Garnish with parsley.
