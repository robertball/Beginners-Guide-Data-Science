Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pie crust
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3 eggs, separated
1/2 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate.
Mix sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl; pour into pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
Five minutes before pie is done, beat egg whites and cream of tartar together in a bowl using an electric mixer on high speed until foamy. Slowly add sugar to egg white mixture and continue beating until meringue forms stiff peaks, about 5 minutes.
Remove pie from oven and increase temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread meringue onto warm pie, making sure meringue goes all the way to the edges creating a seal. Using the back of a spoon, dab the meringue and pull up, creating peaks across the pie.
Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature for 1 hour and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This is my mother's lemon meringue pie recipe and it is one of my all time favorite desserts. You can add a bit more lemon zest if you want it to be more tart! Don't let pie cool before putting on meringue.
