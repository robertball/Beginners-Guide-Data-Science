Ingredients:
1 bunch rocket (arugula) leaves
1 large tomato, cut into cubes
7 ounces halloumi cheese, sliced
1 pita bread round, split
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1/2 teaspoon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine rocket leaves and tomato in a large bowl.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; arrange halloumi cheese slices on top.
Broil halloumi cheese in the preheated oven, until light brown, about 3 minutes. Flip slices and broil on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Cut into cubes; add to the bowl.
Toast pita bread until golden. Cool until crisp, about 5 minutes. Break into small pieces; add to the bowl.
Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, sesame seeds, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Pour into the large bowl; toss salad to combine.
