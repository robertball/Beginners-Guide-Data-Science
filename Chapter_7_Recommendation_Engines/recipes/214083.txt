Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups water
2 cups whole milk
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup whole milk
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Bring the rice, butter, and water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Whisk together 2 cups of milk, flour, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in a bowl, and pour the milk mixture over the cooked rice. Stir to combine, and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Stir in 1 cup whole milk, the cream, raisins, and cinnamon until thoroughly mixed, and allow to cool for a few minutes. Serve warm or cold.

Often called Arroz con Leche, this is a sweet custard-like pudding. I haven't had a single person not love this traditional Mexican rice pudding. You might want to double the recipe!
