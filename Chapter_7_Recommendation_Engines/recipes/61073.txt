Description: 
This is pure eastern North Carolina BBQ Sauce at its best.  Primarily used for saucing up that perfect pig at the family and friends pig pickin', this recipe can be used for other bbq favorites.  With a twist of honey, this sauce is awesome on bbq chicken and pork chops as well.  Enjoy!!
