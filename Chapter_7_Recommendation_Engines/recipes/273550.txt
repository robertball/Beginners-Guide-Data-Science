Ingredients:
3/4 cup milk
3 chai tea bags, or more to taste
Cake:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Frosting:
1/2 cup butter
3 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
Warm 3/4 cup milk in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly to make sure it does not burn, until piping hot but not boiling. Add chai tea bags; set aside and steep for 10 minutes.
Beat sugar and butter together in a medium bowl  using an electric mixer until creamy. Beat eggs in 1 at a time. Stir in vanilla extract.
Combine flour, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and mix well. Stir in 1/2 cup chai mixture until batter is smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cupcakes cool to room temperature before transferring to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Blend together butter and 2 cups confectioners' sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Add remaining chai mixture and gradually add remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar while continuously mixing. Blend until frosting is smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Place frosting into a piping bag, snip off tip of bag with scissors, and pipe onto cooled cupcakes.
