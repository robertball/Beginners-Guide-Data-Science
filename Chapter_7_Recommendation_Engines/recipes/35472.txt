Ingredients:
1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped jalapeno pepper
3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/3 (6 fluid ounce) container liquid pectin
1 sprig fresh mint (optional)

Directions:
Sterilize jars and lids by immersing in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.
In a saucepan, combine the raspberries, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers with the sugar and cider vinegar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and boil rapidly for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes.
Stir in the liquid pectin, and run the mixture through a strainer to remove bits of peppers. Pour the strained liquid into sterilized jars, and seal. Store in a cool dark place. Refrigerate after opening.
