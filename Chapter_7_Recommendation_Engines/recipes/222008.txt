Description: 
Ratatouille a la Braselton, GA. I know some reviewers will cry 'False! This is nothing like ratatouille!' but pfft, because I took the premise of ratatouille, switched it up, and renamed it. Scoop it up on some crusty French bread and you'll be instantly transported to the thrilling town of Braselton.
