Description: 
'I adapted the original recipe for this flavorful soup so I could make it in the slow cooker,' writes Lydia Kroese from Minnetonka, Minnesota. 'It's ideal for staff luncheons at the school where I work, since we don't have easy access to a stove or oven.'Modified from: Hearty Pasta Tomato Soup
