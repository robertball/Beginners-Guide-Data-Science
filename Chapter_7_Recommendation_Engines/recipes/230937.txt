Ingredients:
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup KRAFT Lite Zesty Italian Dressing
4 ounces PHILADELPHIA Neufchatel cheese, cubed
2 tablespoons flour
1/2 cup fat-free reduced-sodium chicken broth
3 cups frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, green beans), thawed, drained
1/2 (15 ounce) package ready-to-use refrigerated pie crust

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Cook chicken in dressing in large skillet on medium heat 2 min. Add Neufchatel; cook and stir 3 to 5 min. or until melted. Stir in flour until well blended. Add broth and vegetables; stir. Simmer 5 min.
Pour into 10-inch deep-dish pie plate; cover with pie crust. Seal and flute edge. Cut slits in crust to permit steam to escape.
Bake 30 min. or until golden brown.

Philadelphia
Description: 
A flaky crust surrenders to a warm veggie-and-chicken mixture infused with a savory sauce. Even better, this makeover is smarter than the classic version. Dig deep.
