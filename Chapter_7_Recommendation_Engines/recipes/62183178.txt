Ingredients:
4 (1 1/4 inch thick) pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
Tbsp minced garlic
Old Bay seasoning
1 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup milk
chopped onion
canned or fresh mushrooms
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season pork chops with salt and pepper to taste. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the pork chops in the butter for about 5 minutes per side.
In a separate medium bowl, combine the milk and soup. Place the pork chops in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour the soup mixture over the chops.
MY TIPS:
I used 6 boneless chops that I seasoned with Old Bay and salt and pepper. I cut up a small onion, 1/2 of a small can of mushrooms and 1 Tbsp of minced garlic. I sauteed that mixture and the chops in a little olive oil until they were brown on both sides. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and mixed that with 2/3 cup of milk, the sauteed garlic, onions and mushrooms. Then bake as directed.
