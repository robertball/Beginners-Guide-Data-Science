Description: 
This is my very own recipe for the best vanilla cupcakes that you will ever have. If you want to double this recipe just use 5 whole eggs instead of 4 eggs plus 2 egg yolks to make your life easier. You can frost these cupcakes with any flavor of frosting you wish like vanilla, chocolate, lemon, strawberry, and lots more.
