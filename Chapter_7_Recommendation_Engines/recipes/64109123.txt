Ingredients:
1 rotisserie chicken, shredded
1 round queso fresco
1can vegetarian refried beans
12 small home style flour tortilla shells
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 bottle green salsa
Sour cream

Directions:
Shred chicken into a large bowl.  Take 1/2 of the queso fresco and crumble into the chicken.  Add basil and cumin, then mix.  Heat refried beans in a small saucepan on stove.  Heat tortillas separately in a microwave for 8 seconds so rolling the tortilla is easier.  Take a spoon of refried beans and spread it on the tortilla.  Add chicken mixture.  Fold into burrito shape and place in an oil sprayed baking dish. Continue with rest of mixture until all chimichangas are filled and ready.  Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Spray chimichangas with cooking spray and bake for 7 minutes until crispy and brown.  Serve while warm with green salsa, more queso fresco crumbles and sour cream.
