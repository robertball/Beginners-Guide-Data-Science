Ingredients:
1 18 oz box Yellow Cake Mix
1 tsp Cinnamon
1 15 oz can solid pack Pumpkin (not pre-seasoned pie filling, use plain pumpkin)
2 Eggs
1 tbsp Milk
1 tsp Vanilla Extract
1 3/4 cup Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets (I use a thin amount of shortening.)
Using a wire whisk, thoroughly blend cake mix and cinnamon, breaking up any lumps in the cake mix. Add pumpkin, eggs, milk and vanilla.  Switching to a spoon, stir until well mixed and all ingredients are completely combined.  Add the chocolate chips and evenly distribute through the dough.
Drop generously rounded tbsp approx. 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake 13-15 minutes according to your oven and cookie size. Cookies will begin to brown a little on the edges, be plump and bounce back to the touch when done.
Cool 2 minutes on cookie sheet and transfer to wax paper, aluminum foil or counter when done.
I prefer to eat them chilled but they are excellent warm from the oven or room temperature as well.

Description: 
As a child, every year for Christmas my Big Nana gave me a pair of homemade mittens with quarters in them and a plate of pumpkin chip cookies. I always ate the cookies cold from the fridge. I looked forward to them every year and this recipe tastes just like the ones I remember.
