Ingredients:
3 egg whites
3/4 cup white sugar
2 1/2 cups shredded coconut, divided
1/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat egg whites and sugar in large bowl until soft and creamy, about 2 minutes. Stir 2 cups shredded coconut and gluten-free flour slowly into the mixture until combined into a dough.
Shape dough into walnut-size balls. Roll in the remaining shredded coconut and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
These traditional Italian soft cookies are a hit at any get-together.  I've made them gluten free but you can use the same amount of all-purpose wheat flour instead of gluten-free flour. There are many variations of this cookie in Italy. Some people add chocolate chips and some drizzle dark chocolate over them once cooled.
