Ingredients:
10 ounces (2 cups) all-purpose flour
10.5 ounces (1.5 cups) sugar
pinch of salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 sticks (1 cup) butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 eggs
1 cup marmalade, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325Â°F and grease a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine first six ingredients and mix until combined. Add eggs one at a time and 1/3 cup marmalade and mix until a thick batter is formed.
Pour batter into greased loaf pan, and bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
Once the cake is cool enough to handle, place remaining 2/3 cup marmalade in a small sauce pan and heat over medium low heat until it begins to liquefy. Place wire rack with cake on it over a baking sheet and drizzle with marmalade. Serve this cake sprinkled with powdered sugar, with an extra dollop of marmalade and a mug of strong black tea.

Description: 
Using marmalade in the batter of this pound cake, as well as a glaze, contributes a little of that bitter flavor to the traditional sugary pound cake, giving what can be a classically simple soft, sweet cake more dimension. This cake can be made without a standing mixer, but be sure to use very soft butter if you are going to attempt it.
