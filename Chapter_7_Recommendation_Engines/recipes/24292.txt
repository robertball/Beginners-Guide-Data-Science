Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup white sugar
1 orange, juiced and zested
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 egg, beaten
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup cranberries, quartered
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a loaf pan.
In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar.
In a 1-cup (or larger) measuring cup combine juice and zest of the orange, butter and enough boiling water to reach 3/4 cup.  Stir into flour mixture.  Fold in egg, walnuts and cranberries.  Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the icing combine confectioners' sugar, butter, orange juice and milk; add more milk if necessary so that the icing is thin and slightly runny.  Drizzle over bread; allow icing to set before slicing.

This is a wonderful treat during the holidays!  It just tastes 'Christmasy' and is a must with a cup of coffee or hot tea!  I received it from a friend from the Northeast.
