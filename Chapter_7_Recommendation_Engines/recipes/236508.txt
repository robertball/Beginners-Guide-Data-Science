Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more if needed
1  onion, minced
1 head garlic, minced, or to taste
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into cubes
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (such as Embasa(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), chopped, adobo sauce reserved, or to taste
2  tomatoes, diced
1 bunch fresh cilantro (leaves only), chopped

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into saucepan; add chicken. Place a lid on the saucepan and cook until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
Put chopped chipotle peppers in a bowl with about half the reserved adobo sauce; stir. Mix tomatoes and cilantro together in a separate bowl.
Stir chipotle mixture into the broth mixture a spoonful at a time, stirring and tasting between each addition, until the level of spiciness is to your liking. Remove saucepan from heat and stir tomatoes with cilantro into the soup.

Spicy, hearty chicken soup. I enjoy mine with some slices of sourdough bread to dip in the soup.
