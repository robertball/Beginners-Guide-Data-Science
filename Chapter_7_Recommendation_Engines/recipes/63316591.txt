Bruschetta ~ the less messy version Recipe

Ingredients:
10-12 roma tomatoes (one package at sams)
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
2-3 Tbs crushed garlic (I use the jar stuff)
5 - 15 fresh basil leaves slivered
1 TBS dried Italian seasoning
2 tsp garlic salt
sliced motz.  (this I also get at Sams ~ I prefer the non sliced kind so I choose how thick I want the slices)
bagel chips
Optional: 2 TBS Balsamic Vinegar

Directions:
In a small sauce pan add oil to about a 1/2" to 1" deep.  (This is how I actually measure is eye balling while pouring)
Add the garlic and cook on low for about 15 - 20 min to roast it.  (it's done when it turns a light brown color.  Over roasting will make the garlic hard little chunks.  Try to avoid this.)
Let cool
While roasting:
Slice the romas about a 1/2" thick.
Put in gallon zipper baggie.
Once the roasted garlic oil is at room temp, add seasonings minus the garlic salt.  (Salt breaks down tomatoes so best to leave for right before serving)
Once thoroughly mixed, add to the zipper bag.  Let sit over night.  (They won't have nearly the flavor you like if you eat right away)
When you are ready to serve
lay out the bagel chips
(drizzle balsamic if you like)
add the tomatoes.
Sprinkle with garlic salt.
top with motz slices (I like 1/4")
