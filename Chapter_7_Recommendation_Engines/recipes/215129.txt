Ingredients:
1 cup soy milk
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup quick cooking oats
1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 cup unpeeled chopped plums
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/4 cup plain soy yogurt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons raw sugar
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix soy milk with lemon juice in a small bowl, and allow to stand for 10 minutes. Mix together the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix together the soured soy milk, plums, 1/2 cup walnuts, soy yogurt, and vegetable oil, and pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture. Stir until just moistened, and place the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Mix together raw sugar, 2 tablespoons of walnuts, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon in a bowl, and sprinkle over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
