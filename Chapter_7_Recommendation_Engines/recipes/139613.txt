Ingredients:
1 cup dried figs
1 cup boiling water
1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
1/2 cup olive oil
4 pounds baby artichokes, halved and chokes removed
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1/2 cup Spanish Marcona almonds
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Place figs in a bowl and cover with the boiling water. Allow the figs to plump for 5 minutes, then remove. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of saffron threads into the remaining liquid, and allow to steep for 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add artichokes, and toss until coated with oil. Pour in saffron water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the artichokes are tender, about 8 minutes.
Uncover the artichokes and increase heat to medium-high. Add the figs, almonds, vinegar, and paprika. Cook and stir until all of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat, recover, and allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving.
