Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup margarine
1 cup milk
2 cups water
2 cups brown sugar
1/4 cup margarine
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Sift the flour and baking powder together in a small bowl. Beat the egg, sugar, and 1/4 cup margarine together in a large bowl. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk to the egg mixture, stirring just to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared dish.
Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan; stir the brown sugar, 1/4 cup margarine, and vanilla extract into the water and return to a boil for 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until the center is set, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
A classic French-Canadian sweet. Along with rice pudding and gelatin, this is one of the most commonly offered desserts in diners. Contrary to the usual recipe, this one uses milk for a more cake-like texture.
