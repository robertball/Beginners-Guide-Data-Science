Ingredients:
1 ¼ cups whole-wheat flour
¼ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, unsalted, cut into small pieces and chilled
2 Tbsp shortening, cut into small pieces and chilled
3 tablespoon honey
1 ½ teaspoons molasses
2 tablespoons vanilla vodka chilled
~2 tablespoons ice water

Directions:
Combine all the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food processor. Cut in the shortening/oil until the texture is dry and crumbly.
In a small bowl, mix the honey, molasses, vodka and water. With a fork mix the liquid with the dry ingredients 1 tablespoon at a time until just combined.
On a floured surface, roll the dough out thin (1/8” thickness or thinner) and cut with cookie cutters. Or you can do the traditional graham cracker shape. If you do this cut them into rectangles and poke each cracker with a fork. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or a silpat. If desired sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
Chill on pan in freezer for 10 minutes while oven is preheating to 350.
Bake for 15 minutes or until they are golden brown and crisp. Once crackers are completely cooled, store them in an air tight container.
