Ingredients:
12 oz. Pasta (Penne is recommended)
One Small Can (4 oz.) of Tomato Paste
One Large Can (28 oz.) of Pureed Tomatoes
One Small Onion, chopped
One Clove of Garlic, minced
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 tsp Balsamic Vinegar
1 tsp Dried Basil
3 tsp Dried Oregano
1 Tbsp Chopped, Fresh Parsley (flat leaf)
Three Artichoke Hearts, chopped
¼ Cup Grated Mozzarella Cheese
Six Black Olives, chopped (optional)
One Handful of Baby Carrots
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Chop the onion and mince the garlic, then sauté in olive oil (in a saucepan) until they are golden-brown.
Add tomato paste and pureed tomatoes into the saucepan, as well as balsamic vinegar, basil, and oregano. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Chop and add artichoke hearts, and cook for another 10 minutes.
Heat up baby carrots in a pot of water, then add pasta once the water is boiling. Cook as the package directs.
Strain the penne and carrots and place them in a bowl or pot. Top with sauce and mix well.
Sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese on top, along with olives (if desired) and parsley, and serve!
