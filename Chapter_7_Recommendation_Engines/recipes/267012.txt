Description: 
Spanakopita is a Cypriot spinach pie and essentially spinach pie from scratch. I've learned how to make it from my mother-in-law, and I am constantly asked by friends and family for the recipe whenever someone new tries it. It takes some time to make, but please don't be discouraged - once you've tried it, you will not regret.
