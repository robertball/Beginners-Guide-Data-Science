Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
2 T honey (heaping)
2 cups bread flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
3 T vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tsp kosher salt
1 T butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and honey.  Add 2 cups flour, and stir to combine.  Let set for 30 minutes, or until big and bubbly.
Mix in 1 1/2 Tablespoons melted butter, salt, gluten, and remaining wheat flour.  Mix in KA on 2 until all flour is well incorporated and pulls away from side of bowl - it should be somewhat still sticky to touch.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.  Cover with a dishtowel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled, apx 1 hour.
Punch down, and place in greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, and allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes; do not overbake.  Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine when done to prevent crust from getting hard.
