Ingredients:
1/2 cup REAL mayonnaise (olive oil mayo is nice)
1/2 cup milk (not skim!)
1 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 green onions, thinly sliced
1-2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1/4 tsp celery seed (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl whisk mayonnaise, milk, and sugar. At this point it may have small lumps. That's okay.
Whisk in vinegar. It should smooth out and thicken slightly. It should be about the consistency of whipping cream. If it doesn't thicken add an extra splash of vinegar.
Stir in celery, onion, salt and pepper and celery seed if using.
Dressing will coat approx 4-5 cups shredded vegetables. It can also be used for cold, cooked potatoes which have been cubed.
This coleslaw is amazing served with your favorite pulled pork recipe!

Description: 
This tangy, slightly sweet dressing was originally for potato salad, but my family decided they liked it better for coleslaw! Try using different vinegars for a slightly different flavor. It's easy to half or double.
