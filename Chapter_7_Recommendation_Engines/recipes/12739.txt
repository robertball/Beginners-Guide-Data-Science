Description: 
I have tried this recipe with several varieties of white fish and it is always wonderful. This recipe also works without the flour for those of you who have allergies to wheat. I run a fish market and have shared this recipe with many people and they always come back with rave reviews. Serve with your favorite tartar sauce and chips (French fries)!
