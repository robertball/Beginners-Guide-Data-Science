Description: 
This makes a good vegan broth that can be used in recipes that call for beef broth (such as French onion soup). I've had it for a while, and am unsure about the origin of it and how close or distant my version is from the original recipe. Also, as with any broth, you don't have to follow the recipe exactly. Fill the pot up and just be more liberal with the ingredients! Freeze whatever you don't need, or refrigerate for a few days.
