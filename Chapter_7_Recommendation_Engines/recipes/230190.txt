Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) bone-in ham
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup whole cloves
1 quart peach nectar
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings, juice drained and reserved
1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, juice drained and reserved

Directions:
Place ham into a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer ham for 1 to 2 hours. Cut away and discard any rind and visible fat.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Score the ham in a diamond pattern and place into a roasting pan. Stir Dijon mustard and brown sugar in a bowl until thoroughly combined; brush mustard mixture onto the ham. Press a whole clove into the center of each scored diamond shape. Pour peach nectar into the roasting pan. Combine pineapple and maraschino liquid in a small bowl.
Bake ham in the preheated oven for 3 hours, basting frequently with the pineapple juice mixture and peach nectar.
Arrange pineapple rings over the ham and secure with toothpicks. Secure a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring with a toothpick.
Bake ham until browned, tender, and fragrant, 1 to 2 more hours, basting ham and fruit frequently with pineapple juice mixture and pan juices.

Description: 
This is my mother's recipe. I have given it a twist by changing the juice flavor; peach is my favorite! I use 2 liters of juice (either peach, pineapple, or passion fruit). I change it every year. It's so good, everyone who has tasted it offers to pay me to cook theirs.
