Ingredients:
1 block cream cheese, softened by hand or mixer
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cup whipped cream from tub
16-20 oz. can crushed pineapple, very well drained
16-20 oz. can pineapple tidbits or chunks, drained
1 graham cracker crust (smaller for a thick pie, 2 extra servings size crust for a thinner pie)

Directions:
Slowly add sugar to cream cheese until well incorporated. Fold in whipped cream a little at a time. Now fold in crushed pineapple. Pour into crust. Top with tidbits or chunks. Let rest in the refrigerator at least 4 hours, but overnight is best. Garnish edge of pie with canned whipped cream if you'd like. Cut and serve.
***Note: you can use a mixer to incorporate the sugar and whipped cream for a slightly smoother pie, but give it overnight to set in the refrigerator.
