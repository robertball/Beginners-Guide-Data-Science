Ingredients:
3 cups sugar
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup light corn syrup
3 T. butter
1 12" sprig rosemary
1 1/2 tsp. lime juice
1 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Bring sugar, sour cream, corn syrup and butter together in a heavy sauce pan over low heat, stirring to combine ingredients.
When butter melts, add rosemary.
Bring to a boil. (Once boiling, be careful not to touch the sides of the pan with the spoon.) Cook to softball stage. (when a few drops of liquid fudge put in ice water are mold-able into a ball)
Remove from heat. Take out rosemary and set aside. (this is the garnish.)
Stir in lime juice and white chocolate chips until chocolate chips are dissolved.
Pour mixture into buttered 8x8 pan.
Place candied rosemary in decorative patterns over fudge, then cut into squares when cool.
This is best if stored in the fridge, but fine at room temperature.
