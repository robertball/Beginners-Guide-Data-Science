Ingredients:
1 ⅔ cups whole milk
¼ teaspoon sea salt
⅓ cup dry farina cereal (such as Cream of Wheat®)
2 tablespoons peanut butter chips (such as Reese's®), divided

Directions:
Bring milk and salt just to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in farina gradually; return to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low; simmer until cereal thickens, about 2 1/2 minutes.
Remove cereal from heat; cool for 3 minutes. Pour cereal into 2 bowls; stir 1 tablespoon peanut butter chips into each bowl.

Description: 
I love Reese's® peanut butter chips and peanut butter in general. I wanted to create a fun recipe that combines my lust for sweets with my practical need to eat healthy food. This recipe is great for kids who are picky 
eaters, or brunch hosts who want to add whimsy to the orange juice mimosas and sausage.
