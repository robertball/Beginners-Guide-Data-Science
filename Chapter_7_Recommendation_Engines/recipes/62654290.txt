In separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. Gradually mix into butter mixture on low speed. Batter will be thick.
Fold in chopped apples and add nuts. Spoon batter into a buttered 9 x 13 pan and smooth out.

Combine the butter w/the brown sugar and flour mixing well, till it's in pea sized bits. Toss the cinnamon and oats together and incorporate into the butter mixture. Sprinkle over the cake.
Bake @ 350 for 45 minutes, or until cake pulls slightly away from edge of pan. Cut. Serve with Hot Buttered Rum Sauce.
To make Hot Buttered Rum Sauce: In medium saucepan, heat sugars, butter, & cream until sugar dissolves and mixture starts to boil. Remove from heat and add the rum. Stir to combine.
