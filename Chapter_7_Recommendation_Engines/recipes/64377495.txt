Ingredients:
1 cup applesauce
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup water
1/2 c cashew, mixed to cream
2 T cocoa powder
2 T sugar
1 tsp agar
1/2 cup peanut butter powder

Directions:
Line a 9x9 inch square pan.
Put applesauce in large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar and vanilla. Mix in the oats. Cook over low heat 2 to 3 minutes, or until ingredients are well blended.  Press half of mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Reserve the other half for topping.
Meanwhile, mix cocoa, sugar into cashew cream and peanut butter powder and agar in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Let mixture cool for a while until it begins to thicken. Pour the chocolate mixture over the crust in the pan, and spread evenly with a knife or the back of a spoon.
Crumble the remaining oat mixture over the chocolate layer, pressing in gently. Cover, and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours or overnight. Bring to room temperature before cutting into bars.
