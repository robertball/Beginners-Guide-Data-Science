Description: 
This is my mom's corn pie. We grew up eating this and loving it in the heart of Amish country. It is a very hearty dish, and easy to make.  Give this one a try before you decide you won't like it. Corn takes on a whole different flavor made this way. Some people add cooked chicken to the pie as well.
