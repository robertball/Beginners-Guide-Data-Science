Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a shallow casserole dish.
Arrange cored apples in the casserole dish. Fill cores with marzipan, raisins, and hazelnuts; apples should be overflowing. Place 1 teaspoon butter over each apple.

Description: 
Had these baked apples, or bratäpfeln, while in Germany. My aunt taught me how to make them, but her instructions were: 'A little bit of this and a little bit of that.' Serve with a cold vanilla sauce or soft pudding.
