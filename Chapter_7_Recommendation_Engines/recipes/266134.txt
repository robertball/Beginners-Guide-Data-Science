Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
1 egg
6 tablespoons warm water
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine sifted flour and butter in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly. Add egg and pulse until just combined.
Dissolve salt in warm water. Add gradually to the food processor and pulse until a soft dough ball forms. Turn ball into a bowl and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
Dust a work surface with flour and knead dough for 1 minute. Roll out thinly and cut into discs. Freeze discs for later use or use right away for your favorite sweet or savory empanadas.
