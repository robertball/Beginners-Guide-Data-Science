Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package moist yellow cake mix
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
1 cup fruit preserves, any flavor

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, mix together the cake mix and flour. Stir in the eggs and water to form a stiff dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 3 inch round circles and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Place a teaspoon of filling into the center of each cookie and pinch the sides to form three corners. Moisten with water if necessary.
Bake for 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool for 1 minute on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a great recipe to use when you're short on time but don't want to deprive your family of that famous Jewish fruit-filled cookie around Purim time. Versions of this recipe have circulated around the Colorado Springs Jewish community for years. At a Purim carnival one year, I asked for someone's copy of the recipe.
