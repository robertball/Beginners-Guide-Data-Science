Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
Your Favorite Pizza crust (you can buy store made or I like this recipe because it’s simple, quick, and quite good)
1/3 cup Brown Sugar
1/2 cup Rolled Oats
2 tablespoons Softened Butter
1/4 cup Flour
Mini Marshmallows
Semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Prepare crust as you normally would.
In a medium sized bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, and butter with a fork until you have corn meal consistency.  Mix in the rolled oats.
Sprinkle this mixture across your pizza crust
Liberally sprinkle marshmallows and chocolate chips onto crust
Bake pizza crust as directed. *Note, if you’re crust cooking time is longer than 10 minutes, you’ll want to wait and add the marshmallows when there is just about 10 minutes left for the pizza to cook.  That prevents them from getting to toasty*
YUM!

Perfect treat for when my nephew's over!  He says they're even better than doughnuts, and it's hard to beat those for that lil' guy!
