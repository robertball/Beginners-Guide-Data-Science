Mix sugar, cream cheese and butter.
Add sugar mixture to pudding; fold in cool whip.

I like to let it cool for atleast a half hour if I have time.
Let's it all meld together and it tastes better cool.

This tastes sooo good! It's very easy to make and also kid friendly. Try using different flavored puddings. Yummy! I also like to do more layers, just makes it more interesting. Use different types of oreos as well.
