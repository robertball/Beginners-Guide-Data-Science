Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas
1 cup pitted dates (optional)
1/2 cup almond butter
1/2 cup coconut flour
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup palm shortening
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Puree bananas and dates in a food processor until smooth. Add almond butter, coconut flour, coconut oil, palm shortening, cocoa powder, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt. Pulse to make a thick batter, scraping sides to fully incorporate ingredients.
Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full. Toss chocolate chips and walnuts together in a small bowl, then sprinkle on top of each muffin, pressing them gently into tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes.
