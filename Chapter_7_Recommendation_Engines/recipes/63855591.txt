Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh Brussels sprouts, halved
2 Tbsp olive oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup half-n-half
6 strips bacon, cooked and crumbled
3 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1/8 tsp white pepper
Dash salt

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with non-stick spray and set aside.
Combine brussels sprouts and olive oil in a large zip close bag and shake to coat. Add the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the bag and shake to coat.
Spread in an even layer on the baking sheet and bake for 15 to 17 minutes until the cheese is melted and the brussels sprouts are lightly browned. Sprinkle bacon over and serve.

Description: 
Even family members who avoided veggies before will love this dish. Make sure you space  vegetables out on the baking sheet. If you overcrowd your veggies they will STEAM, rather than ROAST and you wonâ€™t be happy with the end results.
