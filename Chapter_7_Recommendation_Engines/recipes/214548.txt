Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup sliced yellow onion
2 red potatoes, cubed
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth
1 cup water
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pound firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch chunks
8 ounces langostino or shrimp

Directions:
Heat the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onion, and potato; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute.
Pour in the vegetable broth and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine heavy cream, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and sea salt in a small bowl. Pour 1/2 cup of hot broth into the cream mixture; stir. Whisk in the flour.  Stir the cream mixture into the soup and bring to a boil. Add the fish and shellfish, cover and simmer until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
This summer in Fort Bragg, my husband went on a fishing charter and came back to the campground with a lot of fresh caught Cod.  We came up with this recipe, which was inspired by a pan roast dish we once had in a restaurant.  This dish is very versatile, delicious, and light! Serve with crunchy bread (whole wheat for extra fiber!), lemon wedges, or Tabasco sauce for an extra kick.
