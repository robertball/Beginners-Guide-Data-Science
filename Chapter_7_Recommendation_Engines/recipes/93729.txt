2 cups shredded lettuce
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (low-fat optional)
1 large tomato, chopped
1 bell pepper, seeded, grilled and julienne

Directions:
Marinade: In a shallow nonmetallic dish combine oil, cilantro, lime peel, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, and salt and pepper. Add chicken to marinade, turning to coat. Cover and chill about 1-3 hours.
Chicken:  Drain chicken, reserving marinade. Grill chicken on an uncovered grill directly over medium heat for 5 minutes. Turn chicken and brush with marinade; grill for 7-10 minutes more or until chicken is tender and no longer pink. Wrap flour tortillas in foil and heat on grill or in oven during the last 5 minutes of cooking chicken.
