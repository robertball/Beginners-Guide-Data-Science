Ingredients:
1/3 cup of honey
1 1/4 cups of warm water
2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2/3 cup olive oil
2 eggs
5 - 6 cups unbleached flour
Glaze:
1/4 cup milk
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1 egg white
1 Tablespoon sugar or honey

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the honey in the warm water.  Slowly stir in the yeast.  Set aside for 15 minutes to proof.  Mixture should look fluffy.
Add the salt, oil, and eggs and mix.  Add the flour one cup at a time.  Add enough flour so that the dough is not a huge sticky mess, but be careful not to add too much.  Dough should be slightly tacky.  Knead dough for about ten minutes.  Set in a well oiled bowl and place bowl in a moist, draft free area.  Let rise until double--about 90 minutes.
Cut the dough into two equal parts.  Cut each of these into two parts for a total of four parts.  Make each piece into a long, thin rope.
To braid the challah, flour hands and ropes well.  Starting on the outside left, take the rope and slide it under the next two ropes.  Then wrap it over the braid to the left.  Then go to the outside right, and slide that rope under the middle two, and over the rope to its right.  Continue this under 2 and over one process until the whole loaf is braided.  Let rise in warm place for another hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Glaze challah with the milk glaze.  Let bake for about 30 minutes.  Baking times may vary.  The paler the bread the tastier it will be.
