Ingredients:
4 (3/4 inch-thick) pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 large shallot, chopped
1/2 cup freshly squeezed tangerine juice
1/2 cup Marsala wine
1 orange, zested
1 tablespoon cold butter

Directions:
Season pork chops generously with salt and black pepper; dust lightly with flour. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add olive oil to the hot skillet. Brown pork chops in the hot oil, about 5 minutes per side.
Reduce heat to medium and scatter shallot around chops. Continue to cook meat, flipping once, until chops are fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent shallots from burning. Remove chops and keep warm.
Raise heat to medium-high. Pour tangerine juice and Marsala wine into skillet; bring to a boil. Cook until juice and wine reduce to a glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Return pork chops to skillet and sprinkle with orange zest; add butter to skillet. Flip chops in glaze until coated.
