Ingredients:
PEBRE SAUCE
1/2 cup finely chopped sweet onion, such as Vidalia or Walla Walla
1 medium-large tomato, seeded and diced
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons minced jalapeño, or serrano pepper
2 tablespoons red-wine or cider vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
STEAK
3/4 teaspoon paprika
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
2 8- to 10-ounce New York strip (top loin) steaks, trimmed
2 teaspoons canola oil
2 avocados, pitted and peeled

Directions:
To prepare Pebre Sauce: Place onion in a medium bowl, cover with ice water and let soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Drain. Combine the onion, tomato, cilantro, jalapeño (or serrano), vinegar, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.
Preheat oven to 325°F.
To prepare steak: Mix paprika, cumin, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture evenly over both sides of steaks.
Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet, such as cast iron, over medium-high. Add the steaks and cook just until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast the steaks 5 to 7 minutes for medium-rare, depending on thickness. Transfer to a clean cutting board. Tent with foil and let rest for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mash avocados with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.
Carve the steak into thin slices. Serve with the avocado and Pebre Sauce.

Description: 
This recipe was inspired by the popular Chilean sandwich, called a churrasco, that features a thin sandwich steak, mashed avocado and a type of salsa called Pebre. We found it flavorful and refreshing on a warm summer evening.
