1/3 cup thinly sliced fresh basil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and garlic in a large microwave-safe bowl; heat on high until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add chicken broth and heat on high until simmering, about 4 minutes. Gradually stir in couscous. Cover and let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.
