Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups cranberries (or 2 bags)
6 cups all purpose flour
3 cups sugar
4 1/2 tsp baking powder
3 tsp salt
3 eggs beaten
2 1/4 cups orange juice
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
6 Tbsp Crisco shortening
3 Tbsp orange zest
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts

Directions:
Chop cranberries in food processor, 1 bag at a time, not too fine.
Sift next four ingredients into large kitchen aid mixing bowl.
Next beat eggs with a little orange juice in blender, then add baking soda and remainder of juice and mix together.
Next cut in crisco to the dry ingredients until it looks like cornmeal.  Then add orange zest.
Carefully pour in oj and egg mixture.
Mix, but not too much.
Finally add cranberries and chopped walnuts.
Mix until incorporated.
Preheat oven to 350.
Grease and flour 3 8x4 loaf pans, or two loaf pans and 3 small tins.
Cook for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry.  The smaller loafs will cook quicker, check at around 40 mins.
These can be frozen after they have cooled.  I promise they will go quick when you put them out.
Try them with oj or eggnog and chocolate turkeys - it's the breakfast of champions!!!
