Ingredients:
3 cups filtered water
1/4 cup dried red hibiscus flowers
1/8 cup dried white hibiscus flowers
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice
1 Tbsp fresh mint, chopped
1/3 cup fresh pomegranate seeds

Directions:
Heat water to a low boil. Add hibiscus flowers and sugar, stir until the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool and strain. Add the grapefruit juice and chopped mint. Mix well. Refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours. Add the chilled mixture to an ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add the pomegranate seeds five minutes before the granita has reached the soft ice cream stage.
If you don’t have an ice cream maker, put the mixture into a freezer safe container and stir every hour. Remember to scrape down the sides when you mix the granita. When the granita is firm, but still soft, add the pomegranate seeds and mix well.

Description: 
Tart and tangy with a hint of sweetness, this granita is perfect after a meal or even as a refresher in the afternoon. I made up this recipe when trying to find ways to introduce blood pressure lowering hibiscus flowers to our diets.
