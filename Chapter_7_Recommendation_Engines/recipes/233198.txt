Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups cornmeal
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded pepperjack cheese
1/2 cup minced onion
1/2 cup minced red bell pepper
2 cups milk
1/2 cup canola oil
1 (14.75 ounce) can sweet cream-style corn
1 (4 ounce) can canned diced green chiles
1/2 cup HERDEZ® Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce
Non-stick cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place a 9x13 casserole dish in the oven to heat up while you mix up the batter.
Mix together the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Stir in the Cheddar cheese, pepper Jack cheese, onion, and red bell pepper.
Add the milk, oil, corn, green chile peppers, and Mexican cooking sauce. Stir well.
Carefully remove the hot baking dish from the oven and spray it with non-stick cooking spray. Immediately pour the batter into the hot baking dish, and put it back in the oven.
Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This cornbread is so moist I eat it with a fork rather than picking it up. It has a slight kick, but for more spice add more chile cooking sauce or a jalapeno pepper. Serve it with chili, vegetable soup, or beef stew. But it also makes a great bedtime snack with a glass of milk!
