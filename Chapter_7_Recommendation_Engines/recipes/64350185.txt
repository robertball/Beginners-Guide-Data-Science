Ingredients:
Heavy cream (avoid ultra-pasteurized)

Directions:
Fill a jar halfway with heavy cream. Then, screw the lid on firmly (a canning jar works well for this purpose).
Start shaking the jar back and forth. After several minutes, the cream will thicken and turn into whipped cream. Keep shaking until the whipped cream is replaced with a yellow glob (butter) and a separate liquid (buttermilk).
Pour the buttermilk out of the jar, and use it in any recipe that calls for buttermilk.
