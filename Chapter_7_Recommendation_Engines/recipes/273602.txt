Ingredients:
4 large ripe bananas
1 egg
1/3 cup coconut oil
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon pure vanilla
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2/3 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with coconut oil or line cups with paper liners.
Use a fork to mash bananas in a bowl. Blend in egg, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla. Stir whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl, making a well in the center. Pour banana mixture into the well and stir until batter is just combined; fold in unsweetened coconut and chocolate chips.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
