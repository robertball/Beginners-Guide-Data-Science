Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
6 whole allspice berries
6 whole cloves
1 cinnamon stick
1 pod whole star anise
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 cup bourbon whiskey
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup orange juice
1/3 cup ketchup

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook garlic and ginger for about 2 minutes. Add allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and star anise; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add maple syrup, bourbon, and brown sugar to the saucepan.
Cook and stir mixture until reduced and thickened to a glaze consistency, about 5 minutes. Whisk orange juice and ketchup into glaze until smooth. Strain glaze to remove spices.

Description: 
This was one of the best glazes I've ever put on a ham. It is quite sweet, but if that is your thing, then this is your thing!
