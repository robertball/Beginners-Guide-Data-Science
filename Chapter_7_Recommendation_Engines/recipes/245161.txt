Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 jalapeno pepper - seeded, membranes discarded, and pepper chopped
1 1/2 pounds pepperjack cheese, cut into cubes
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans evaporated milk
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter together in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir red bell pepper and jalapeno pepper into  onion mixture; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and mix pepperjack cheese and spinach into onion mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and mixture is thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly pour enough evaporated milk into cheese mixture, stirring constantly, until desired consistency is reached; season with salt. Continue to cook and stir over low heat until warmed through, at least 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Styled after a similar appetizer at The Blue Moose in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, this is a very addicting creamy appetizer that goes well with tortilla chips. It has a little kick, but not enough to make your eyes water. Of course, for the heat lovers, you can kick it up a notch if desired. This has become an instant family-favorite and one of my most requested appetizers.
