Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 pound brussel sprouts
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Heat oil in a fry pan until hot but not smoking.  Saute brussel sprouts quickly until they start to show color.
Add balsamic vinegar (enough to cover the bottom of the pan about 1/4 inch deep).   Allow the sprouts to boil in the vinegar until the sprouts begin to caramelize.
Cover and bake in a hot oven for about 15 minutes until vinegar turns to glaze.
Season with salt and serve.
