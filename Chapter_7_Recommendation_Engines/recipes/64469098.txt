Ingredients:
1 bag of marshmallows, minus 2-3 sacrificial tastings to appease the GISHWHES overlords
1 stick of butter
A 14-16oz box of cereal of your choice (Dinomite prefers Fruity Pebbles, but he won't bite if you pick something else)
1 Tsp of vanilla
$1.99 plus local sales tax

Directions:
Try to find a clean pot to cook in,  kids never do the dishes...
Cut up butter into small cubes, place in pan on medium heat
Wander off and forget what you are doing
Notice butter is boiling and starting to turn brown. Quickly turn heat down and toss in remaining marshmallows.
Wonder how many calories are going to be in resulting treats; decide you don't care.
Once marshmallows are melted, add all the cereal. Start mixing it in, realize it's way too hard. Go in search of some poor sucker to stir for you.
Before you find someone, notice that Supernatural is on. Sit down to watch Sam and Dean do their thang.
Smell burning. Go to kitchen to investigate...
All the cereal is burned and dried out, and your pan is ruined. Luckily you didn't burn the house down. Throw the whole thing in the trash, once it has cooled to room temperature of course.
Realize you suck at cooking and just drive to the corner store and buy a candy bar. Congratulate yourself on coming up with a delicious treat that requires no time, ingredients, or clean up!
