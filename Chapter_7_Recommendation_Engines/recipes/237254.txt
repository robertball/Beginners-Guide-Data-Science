Description: 
I hope to try this on smoked pork ribs. This spice blend offers delightful possibilities. Steep it in tea. Sprinkle it on toast or oatmeal. Fold it into softened butter and spread it on a muffin. Stir it into sugar and sprinkle it on your favorite sugar cookie just before baking. Add a teaspoon to vinaigrette to spice up salads with fresh greens and seasonal fruits.
