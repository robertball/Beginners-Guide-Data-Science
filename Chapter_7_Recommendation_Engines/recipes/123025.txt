Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 eggs
2 cups chopped dates
2 cups chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine cake mix and brown sugar. Add butter and eggs; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Combine dates and walnuts; stir into batter (the batter will be stiff).
Spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  Run a knife around sides of pan to loosen; cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
You'll need just six ingredients, including a convenient boxed cake mix, to bake up these chewy bars chock-full of walnuts and dates. They are my husband's favorite snack, and he loves to take them to work. I often whip up a batch for bake sales or to share with my co-workers at our local car dealership.
