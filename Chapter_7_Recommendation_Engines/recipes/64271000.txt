Ingredients:
4 cups cold water
2 cups fat free low sodium chicken broth
1 Tbsp whole black peppercorns
5 garlic cloves, crushed
2 skinless boneless chicken breast halves
1 celery stalk, coarsely chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 jalape√±o pepper, halved
1/2 medium onion, cut into wedges
1 (7 oz) can salsa verde
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup chopped seeded tomato
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp ground red pepper
4 oz low fat cream cheese, softened
12 (6-inch) corn tortillas
1/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Combine first 9 ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook 25-30 minutes or until chicken is done. Remove chicken from pan using a slotted spoon; let stand 10 minutes. Shred the chicken, and set aside. Drain cooking liquid through a sieve over a Bowl; reserve cooking liquid. Discard solids.
Combine reserved cooking liquid and salsa verde in a saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups (about 30 minutes). Reduce heat to low; stir in whipping cream. Place pan over low heat.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add tomato and next 5 ingredients (through cream cheese) to chicken; toss. Dip each tortilla in sauce mixture for ten seconds. Fill each tortilla with about 1/4 cup chicken mixture; roll up. Arrange filled tortillas, seam side down, in an 11X 7 inch glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray. Spoon sauce over tortillas; top evenly with cheddar cheese.
Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes or until lightly browned.
