Ingredients:
1  pork tenderloin
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, divided
½ small onion
¼ cup chopped mushrooms
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon steak seasoning
1 small chorizo sausage, thinly sliced, slices cut in half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut pork tenderloin down the center lengthwise nearly all the way through, leaving the two sides attached; sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce.
Stir onion, mushrooms, and garlic together in a bowl. Distribute mushroom mixture evenly along center of pork; sprinkle with remaining Worcestershire sauce and steak seasoning. Lay chorizo slices evenly along mushroom stuffing.
Pierce tenderloin with 4 or 5 skewers crosswise through both edges; wrap butcher's twine around skewers, as if lacing shoelaces, and pull tenderloin closed around stuffing. Tie ends of twine together; place tenderloin in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink at the center, and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of the pork reads at least 145 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 30 minutes. Remove string and skewers; cut into 2-inch thick medallions to serve.

Description: 
This is a mouth-watering recipe for pork tenderloin. I invented the recipe myself because I thought the ingredients would go well together and they do. I serve it with a fresh green salad and fried rice.
