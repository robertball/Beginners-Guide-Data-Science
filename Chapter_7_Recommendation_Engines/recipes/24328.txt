Ingredients:
4 eggs
3 (15 ounce) cans asparagus, drained
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup

4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel and slice.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
In the prepared dish layer 1 1/2 cans of asparagus, 1 can mushroom soup, 2 eggs and 1 cup of crushed crackers.  Repeat layers with remaining ingredients.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.  Remove cover and top with grated cheese.  Cover and bake an additional 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
This is a recipe my mother always made on special occasions--it was the only casserole dish my father would eat.  My husband had never eaten asparagus until we married 25 years ago and now always requests this dish when asked what he would like on special occasions.  It is so easy and so delicious!
