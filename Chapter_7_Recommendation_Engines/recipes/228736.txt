Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
3 cups old-fashioned oats
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; stir to combine. Sift flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into butter-sugar mixture until thick and free of clumps. Gradually stir oats, 1 cup at a time, into batter until evenly mixed. Fold in chocolate chips.
Scoop 1 to 2 tablespoons batter and drop onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining batter, keeping about 2 inches between each scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, 9 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet before removing, 30 minutes.
