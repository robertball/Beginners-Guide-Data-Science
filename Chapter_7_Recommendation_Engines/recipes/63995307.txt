Ingredients:
Sweet and Spicy Rub:
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 pound salmon fillet or Steel Head Trout
2 teaspoons MazolaÂ® Corn Oil
Orange Salsa:
2 cups orange sections, Cara Cara or Blood oranges
1/3 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 jalapeno pepper, diced - optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Combine paprika, onion and garlic powder, salt, oregano, thyme, black pepper, cayenne pepper and brown sugar in a small bowl.
Cut salmon into 4 portions and brush with oil.  Distribute the rub over the salmon generously coating all surfaces. Place salmon on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until fish flakes easily.
Coarsely chop oranges into bite size pieces.  Combine all salsa ingredients and serve with salmon.  Salsa can be made ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve.

Description: 
I prefer Steel Head Trout to salmon but either fish works well to create this easy, healthy, delicious dinner.
Moist with a sweet but savory rub that is perfectly complemented by the fresh fruit salsa.Modified from: Sweet and Spicy Salmon with Grapefruit Salsa
