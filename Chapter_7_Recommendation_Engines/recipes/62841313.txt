Ingredients:
1.5 pounds ground turkey
1.5 pounds ground venison
.25-.50 cup seasoned bread crumbs
.25 cup finely diced onion (option 1)
1-2 TBL. onion powder or onion bits (option 2)
1 egg, lightly beaten OR .5 cup egg substitute
.25 cup chopped fresh parsley OR Italian seasoning
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced (or more)
2 TBL. Worcestershire AND/OR soy sauce (optional)
1 teaspoon salt (less if using soy sauce)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Other Options:  cajun seasoning, hot sauce, replace bread crumbs with panko or flax seed meal, liquid smoke, a bit of dijon mustard, Montreal steak seasoning, cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix ground turkey, venison, seasoned bread crumbs, onion, egg, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper. Form into 12 patties, with an indentation in the center of each.
Several reviewers suggested putting the patties on a sheet of waxed paper and putting into the freezer for about 10 minutes.  Said it helps retain shape and moisture.
Cook the patties in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning once, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C).  Can also be cooked on Foreman grill or outdoor grill.
