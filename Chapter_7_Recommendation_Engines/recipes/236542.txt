Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3/4 white onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pound frozen shrimp, thawed
2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 teaspoon red chile paste, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) package wide rice noodles
hot water to cover
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1/4 cup Greek-style yogurt, or to taste
1/4 cup chopped peanuts, or to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat; saute onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes until garlic is slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp begin to firm, about 5 minutes.
Stir tomatoes, peanut butter, and red chile paste into shrimp mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
Divide noodles among serving plates; top with shrimp sauce. Garnish each serving with cilantro, yogurt, and peanuts.
