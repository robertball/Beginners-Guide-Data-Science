Ingredients:
1 pkg ranch powder (2-3 tablespoons)
2 (8oz) pkgs cream cheese
1.5 cups sour cream

Directions:
The ranch powder, depending on the brand, comes in different strengths so I usually just sort of add things until it tastes right. I usually use it for chip or vegetable dip. Great on crackers!
