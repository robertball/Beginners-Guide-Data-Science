Ingredients:
1 cup chicken stock
1 cup bulgur wheat
1 pint grape tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup finely diced green pepper (apx 1/2 small green pepper)
1/4 cup finely diced red onion (apx 1/2 small red onion)
1 large red chile, seeded , cored and diced (reserve seeds for dressing)
15.5 oz can black beans
15.5 oz can corn
1/3 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 Tbsp lime zest (apx 2 limes)
1/3 cup lime juice (apx 3 limes)
1/2 Tbsp fresh garlic (apx 1-2 cloves, see cooking tip above)
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp salt
1 Tbsp white wine vinegar
2 Tbsp honey
1/2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Seeds from red chile (the more, the spicier)
1 large avocado, diced (coat with lime juice)
Tostitos rolls, break in half and sprinkle on top
Optional: Add 1-2 jalapenos with seeds to increase spice factor

Directions:
Bring the chicken stock to a boil on high in a medium saucepan.  Remove from heat and add bulgur wheat.  Stir to mix well, then cover and set aside.  Allow to sit for 30minutes.
Chop, slice and dice the veggies (tomatoes, green pepper, onion, chile) and throw them in a medium salad bowl, or if you plan on saving some for later in the week, it's easiest to put it directly in a large bowl of your food storage container of choice.
Add dressing ingredients to a bowl except oil, add slowly at the end whisking until combined.
Allow bulgur wheat to cool, then add it to the veggies and toss to combine.  Pour on the dressing and toss to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour.  Add avocado, toss to combine. Top with chips.  Ole!!
