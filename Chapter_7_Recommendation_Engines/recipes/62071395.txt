Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup all-purpose flour, warm water, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tbsp olive or other vegetable oil, olive oil for frying

Directions:
Sift together the flour and salt into a large bowl. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add the 2 tbsp of oil, and enough warm water to make a soft dough that is elastic but not sticky. If the dough becomes too sticky, add more flour. Knead the dough with your hands on a floured surface until it is smooth. Divide the dough into 10 parts, or less if you want to make really big breads. Roll each part of dough into a ball. Using a floured rolling pin, roll each ball into a tortilla shape. They should be very thin. Rub a little bit of oil into a frying pan and heat on the stove. when the pan starts smoking, put a chapati in it. It shouldn't take to long to cook one side, check the underside and it should be white with light brown spots. Turn over and cook the other side. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls. Serve with Indian curry, main dishes, or even use to make sandwich wraps. Enjoy!
