Description: 
A co-worker couldn't decide on her favorite for her birthday treat, brownies or chocolate chip cookies, so she said I should just pick one. On the way home I thought this up and couldn't find it on Allrecipes so I created it. These go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.
