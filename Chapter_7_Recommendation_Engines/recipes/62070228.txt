Description: 
These sweet and tangy ribs are sure to please!  A good friend gave this recipie to me after she had us over to her house one evening.  This versatile sauce can also be used on chicken thighs, wings, or legs.  Make sure to have plenty of napkins on hand when you serve these because they are finger-lickin good!
