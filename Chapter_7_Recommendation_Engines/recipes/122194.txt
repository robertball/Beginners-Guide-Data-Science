Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 broiler/fryer chicken (3 to 4 pounds), cut up
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green pepper
1 cup thinly sliced celery
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (16 ounce) package frozen corn, thawed

Directions:
Place flour in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat. In a large skillet, brown the chicken in oil; transfer to an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish.
Drain skillet, reserving 2 tablespoons drippings. In the drippings, saute onion, green pepper and celery until tender. In a bowl, combine the ketchup, water, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper; add to vegetables. Bring to a boil. Pour over the chicken.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with corn. Bake 18-20 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear and corn is tender.
