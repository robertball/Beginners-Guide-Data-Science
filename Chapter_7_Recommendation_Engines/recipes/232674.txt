Ingredients:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 eggs
1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (such as Better Batter®)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl. Add pumpkin, eggs, buttermilk, and maple syrup; beat into the sugar mixture. Stir flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and cloves together in a separate bowl; blend into the pumpkin mixture. Fold raisins into the resulting batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I have to eat gluten free. My husband doesn't have to but he does. When I make the food homemade it is so much like what we have always known that it isn't a hardship. This is a lovely, moist pumpkin raisin bread. I use Better Batter® Gluten-Free all-purpose flour. I measure by weight and that has made all the difference! I refuse to use bean flour mixes; who wants bean flavor in their sweets? Let it cool completely or it will not hold together. Once it is cooled you can slice and serve. Enjoy!
