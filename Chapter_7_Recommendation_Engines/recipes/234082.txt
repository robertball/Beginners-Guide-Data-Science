Ingredients:
¾ cup butter
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1  white onion, diced
1  green bell pepper, diced
⅔ cup all-purpose flour
6 cups milk
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef consomme
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package provolone cheese, diced
¾ pound sliced roast beef, chopped

Directions:
Melt butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper in the hot pot until tender, about 5 minutes. Add flour and continue to cook and stir until flour is golden, about 5 minutes more.
Gradually whisk milk into vegetable mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add beef consomme; season soup with salt and pepper. Slowly stir provolone cheese into soup until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in roast beef.
