Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breast
1 lb. lump crab meat
(2) 1/4 tsp dry mustard
(2) 1/2 tsp worchestire
(2) tsp dried parsley
(white wine optional)
salt and pepper to taste
6 saltine crackers (or handful of breadcrumbs)
(2) 1 egg, beaten
2 tbs. mayo
1/2 c mayo
Old Bay to taste
juice of 1 lemon

Directions:
Marinade chicken with lemon juice, Old Bay, 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 tsp worchestire, 1 tsp parsley and white wine.  (I have also substituted the lemon juice and white wine for 1/4 cup Lemon flavored white cooking wine.)  While marinading in fridge, preheat oven to 350 and prep the crab imperial.
Crab Imperial:  combine 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 tsp worchestire, 2 tsp parsley, Old Bay to taste, cracker crumbs, beaten egg and 2 tbs. mayo.  When mixed well, add crab.  Do not over stir the meat so as not to break up the lump pieces.  In a separate bowl, mix a beaten egg and 1/2 cup mayo...set aside.
Pull chicken from fridge, sear both sides in skillet with juices.  Remove from pan, top with crab imperial, then pour some of the mayo/egg mixture on top of the crab.  Bake in oven for 15-20 mins, until crab is golden brown.
