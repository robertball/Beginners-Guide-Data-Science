Ingredients:
To make the lentils
1 cup dry green lentils (193 g, do not use red lentils, too mushy)
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
Lentil batter remaining ingredients
1/2 heaping cup finely chopped white onion (80 g)
1 packed tablespoon minced fresh garlic (4 cloves, depending on size)
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 cup water (for cooking the veggies in)
1 cup barbecue sauce, separated plus extra for serving (see Spicy BBQ Sauce for Lentil Loaf)
1/2 cup medium grind coarse cornmeal, not corn flour (I used Bob's Red Mill, do not sub this, or the texture could result in a dry or mushy loaf)
3 tablespoons ground flaxseed
1/4-1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili spice (gives a hefty kick of heat, so ONLY use 1/4 tsp if sensitive)
1/2 cup corn (can or frozen, just drain any excess water, I used frozen)
My 5 minute homemade barbecue sauce (Makes 1 1/2 cups, plenty for the loaf and for dipping!)
1/2 cup tomato paste, not sauce
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon chili powder (use LESS if you are sensitive to spicy)
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon yellow wet mustard
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons dark balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons unsulphured regular molasses

Directions:
BBQ Sauce: add all of the ingredients to a small bowl and whisk really well until emulsified and thickened. Set aside or store in the fridge the night before making the loaf.
For the lentils, rinse them off and add them with 2 cups water and 1/2 tsp salt to a pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover, turn to simmer and cook for 35-40 minutes. The water should be all evaporated basically. Turn off the heat and return the lid and let it sit for just 10 minutes.
While the lentils are cooking, cook the onions and garlic, boil water then immediately turn to simmer for about 5 minutes or until the water has completely evaporated. You don't want any remaining water so the loaf doesn't turn mushy. Turn off the heat.
Puree about 1/2 of the lentil mixture. You do not want to puree all of it, or it will make the loaf mushy, got it? Just eyeball about half of it, leaving the other half full lentils. Add them to a large bowl.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a 9x5 loaf pan with parchment paper hanging slightly over the sides for easy removal later.
Add the onion/garlic mixture to the lentils. Add  3/4 cup of the bbq sauce to the lentil mixture. Add the chipotle spice and pinch of salt and stir well.* Add the cornmeal and flaxseed and stir until it becomes really thick and sticky. Gently stir in the corn.
Pour the batter in the loaf pan and spread out evenly. Let it sit for about 20 minutes before baking, so the cornmeal soaks up some liquid. Spread 1/4 cup of the barbecue sauce all over the top evenly. Bake for 55-60 minutes or until firm and a toothpick basically comes out clean. I baked mine for a full 60 minutes to ensure it was done.**
