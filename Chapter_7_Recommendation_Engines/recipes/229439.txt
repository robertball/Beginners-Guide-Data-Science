Ingredients:
2 cups Minute(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Brown <sup>&reg;</sup>ice, uncooked
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, divided
1 (20 ounce) package ground turkey or chicken
¾ cup green onions, thinly sliced, divided
½ cup teriyaki sauce, divided
1  egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons orange marmalade

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare rice according to package directions.
Drain 1/2 cup crushed pineapple for meatballs. Reserve remaining pineapple and juice for sauce.
Combine ground turkey or chicken, cooked rice, 1/2 cup pineapple, 1/2 cup green onions, 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce, egg, ginger and nutmeg in large bowl. Mix well.
Scoop mixture and gently roll into desired meatball size (we suggest about the size of a golf ball); place meatballs on aluminum foil-lined baking sheet with sides. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until meatballs are done.
While meatballs are baking, to make sauce, combine remaining pineapple and juice, remaining 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce and orange marmalade in medium saucepan; heat to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup green onions.
Top cooked meatballs with sauce.
