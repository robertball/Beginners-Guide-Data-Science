Ingredients:
6 green apples
1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries
2 1/4 cups water
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Core the apples, and remove the peel from the top third of each one. Place them in a baking dish, and fill the core holes with as many cranberries as you can fit.
Meanwhile, stir together the water, brown sugar and honey in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar and honey if necessary. Once it comes to a boil, pour the mixture over the apples.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, basting with the juices every 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.
