Ingredients:
- 300 gms (10 1/2 ounces) Sugar (less if the pineapple is very sweet)
- 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) water
- 200 gms (7 ounces) pineapple chunks, no skin, no core, roughly chopped
- 3 Passion fruit
- 1 Tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 egg white
- 100 ml (0.4 cups) cold water

Directions:
In a pan, dissolve the sugar in the 300 ml (1 1/4 cups) of water and bring to the boil (see Footnotes). As soon as it comes to the boil, remove from heat, take out any extras you might have added, and allow to cool.
Drop the roughly chopped pineapple into a blender.
Halve the passion fruit and drip into the blender through a sieve. You are allowed to press the passion fruit through the sieve. Retain one or two spoons of the seeds, but discard the rest. Put the retained seeds into the blender.
Add the lemon juice to the blender, and then add all the cooled syrup. Blend thoroughly.
In  a bowl large enough to mix everything in, beat the egg white until soft peaks are formed. Gently fold in the blended mixture and then the 100 ml cold water.
If you have an ice cream machine, then churn the mixture in that - otherwise pour the mixture into a freezer box, or boxes, leaving the lid off, and freeze in the freezer, mixing it up and scraping the edges particularly, every 20 or 30 minutes until fully set.
