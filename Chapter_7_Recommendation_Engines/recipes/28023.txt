Ingredients:
¾ cup distilled white vinegar
¼ cup barbeque sauce
¼ cup soy sauce
½ cup brown sugar
2  tomatoes, diced
1  green bell pepper, diced
2 cups chopped fresh mushrooms
1 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces

Directions:
In a large stockpot or dutch oven, over medium heat, combine the vinegar, barbeque sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar. Stir in the tomatoes, green pepper, and mushrooms. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then add the chicken. Continue to simmer until chicken is tender and pulls from the bone easily, about 30 minutes.
When chicken is cooked through, remove it from the pot and tear the meat off of the bones into bite sized pieces. Discard bones and return the chicken to the pot and heat through. Serve hot over rice.
