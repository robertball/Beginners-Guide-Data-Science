Ingredients:
4 sheets phyllo dough
4 teaspoons butter, melted
32 helix snails, without shells
2 cups heavy whipping cream
4 egg yolks
4 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/4 cup dry white wine
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a cupcake pan with non-stick cooking spray.
Place the phyllo dough on a flat surface and brush each sheet with the melted butter. Layer the sheets on top of one another and cut the pile into fours. Push each piece of dough into a cupcake pan, forming cups with the dough.
Bake the phyllo cups for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden.
Drain the snails and rinse them with running water until the liquid runs clear. In a small bowl, mix together the heavy cream and egg yolks.
Melt butter in a saute pan; add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add snails and white wine. Saute for a couple of minutes. Pour in the heavy cream mixture. Bring to a boil and season with the salt and pepper. The sauce will thicken while cooling.
Remove the phyllo cups from the muffin tins. Place a phyllo cup on a plate or bowl and put 8 snails in the cup and flowing out of the cup. Pour the cream sauce around the cup.
