Ingredients:
6 large russet baking potatoes
2 tablespoons canola oil
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Toppings:
6 tablespoons sour cream
6 tablespoons green onions, chopped
6 tablespoons grated sharp Cheddar cheese
6 tablespoons diced cooked bacon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Toss potatoes with oil in a large bowl until well coated. Add garlic salt, chili powder, and pepper and continue to toss until spices are evenly distributed.
Place potatoes directly on the center rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted in the center of a potato offers little resistance, about 40 minutes more.
Slice each baked potato lengthwise down the center, add sour cream, green onions, Cheddar cheese, and bacon. Serve piping hot.

Description: 
This is a nice spin on a loaded classic favorite. When the baked potato skin gets left uneaten, then most of the nutrients get tossed. Flavor it up a bit. You'll love it!
