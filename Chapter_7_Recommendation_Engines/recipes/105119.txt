Ingredients:
Nonstick olive oil cooking spray
8 1/2-inch-thick slices French bread or other firm-texture bread
1 1/2 cups refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed
2 tablespoons canned diced green chili peppers
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
2 slices Canadian-style bacon, cut into thin strips
2 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Lightly coat a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with cooking spray. Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with French bread slices, cutting to fit.
In a medium bowl, combine egg product, chili peppers, and black pepper. Pour egg mixture evenly over bread.  Sprinkle with Canadian-style bacon or ham.  Top with tomato slices and cheese. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
Bake, uncovered, in a 350  degrees F oven about 25 minutes or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Before serving, sprinkle with cilantro.
