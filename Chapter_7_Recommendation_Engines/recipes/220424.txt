Ingredients:
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup oyster sauce
2 tablespoons tamarind pulp
1 (12 ounce) package dried rice noodles
cold water, as needed
1/2 cup peanut oil
4 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
12 ounces chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch strips
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts
1 1/2 teaspoons dried ground Asian radish
1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh chives
2 cups fresh bean sprouts
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Whisk together rice wine vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, oyster sauce, and tamarind pulp in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes; remove from heat and set aside.
Place rice noodles in a large bowl and pour enough cold water to cover noodles. Allow to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs and garlic in hot oil until eggs are softly cooked, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir chicken and noodles into eggs and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes.
Pour rice wine vinegar sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt into the noodle mixture.
Stir peanuts, ground radish, and chili powder into noodle mixture; cook until peanuts soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Add more sugar or chili powder if desired.
Remove from heat and toss chives with noodle mixture. Top with bean sprouts and garnish with lime wedges.

Description: 
This is a famous dish popularized in Thailand. Although the recipe varies from cook to cook and region to region, this is a good attempt at recreating what I ate from Thai-owned hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Okinawa, Japan. Key to the flavor are the sugar levels, unsalted peanuts, peanut oil, and either oyster or fish sauce.
