Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed, divided
1 pound ground turkey, or more to taste
5 baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
3/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (8 ounce) can cream-style corn

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and 1 clove garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground turkey; cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour off and discard any excess fat.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes and cover. Boil until tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and let sit in pot, covered, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk, butter, salt, and remaining 1 clove garlic; mash.
Combine whole kernel corn and cream-style corn in a small bowl.
Layer ground turkey mixture evenly in a 2-quart casserole dish. Layer corn mixture on top. Add mashed potatoes, pushing downward and spreading to fill the casserole dish evenly.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven, about 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake until top is browned, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
This ground turkey shepherd's pie is an easy recipe with basic main ingredients - turkey, corn, and potatoes. Although simple to prepare, it is large on taste and has always been a favorite. It also freezes and re-heats well, so I often make a few batches at a time. The potatoes can be cooked in chicken or beef broth for added flavor. Enjoy!
