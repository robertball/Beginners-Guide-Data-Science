2 cups 		basmati rice
2 Tbsp. 	oil
1 		cinnamon stick
6 		whole cloves
2 		bay leaves
1 cup 		finely sliced onion
1 cup 		frozen peas

Directions:
Rinse rice well, cover and soak at least 15 minutes.  Heat oil over med-high heat.  Add cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves.  Sauté until cloves puff up, about 1 minute.  Add onion and sauté until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.  Drain rice and stir into onions.  Add peas and mix well.  Add 3.5 cups cold water and salt.  Cover and bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to as low as possible and cook, covered, for 25 minutes without peeking.  Remove from heat and set lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape.  Let rest 5 minutes.  Discard cinnamon stick, cloves and bay leaves.  Fluff with fork.
