Ingredients:
3 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon ground flax seed
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup oats
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup raw sugar
1/2 cup coconut sugar
1/2 cup coconut oil
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup vegan chocolate chips (optional)
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper.
Mix water and ground flax seed together in a bowl, creating a "flaxegg"; set aside until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Combine whole wheat flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Beat raw sugar, coconut sugar, and coconut oil together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; add pumpkin puree, flaxegg, and vanilla extract and mix well.
Pour pumpkin mixture into flour mixture and stir just until dough is combined; fold in chocolate chips and pecans. Scoop dough onto the prepared baking sheet using a small ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned around the edges, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
