Ingredients:
1/4 cup raw cashews
1 ripe banana
1 cup ice cubes
3 ounces extra-firm tofu, pressed to remove water
1/3 cup cacao powder
2 Medjool dates, pitted
3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon soy milk, or more as needed
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/3 cup crushed peanuts

Directions:
Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water. Soak for 1 to 3 hours. Drain.
Combine soaked cashews, banana, ice cubes, tofu, cacao powder, dates, peanut butter, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon soy milk, and salt in a blender. Process until smooth. Add an additional teaspoon of soy milk only if needed, in order to keep the mixture as thick as possible.
Pour into a bowl and sprinkle with crushed peanuts.
