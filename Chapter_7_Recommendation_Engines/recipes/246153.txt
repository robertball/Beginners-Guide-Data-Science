Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
1 tablespoon honey
1  lemon, juiced
3 tablespoons Indonesian sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)
2 tablespoons honey
2 heads bok choy, ends trimmed
1 bunch broccolini, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
3 ounces snow peas, ends and strings removed
2 large tomatoes, sliced
1 large mango - peeled, seeded, and sliced
1 large Hass avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced
1  bell pepper, sliced
1 bunch mint

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add chicken and 1 tablespoon honey. Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Cover and remove from heat.
Place lemon juice, soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons honey in a small bowl; whisk dressing until well combined.
Rinse bok choy, broccolini, and snow peas together in a strainer. Transfer to a microwave-safe bowl; cook in the microwave until lightly steamed, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large salad bowl; add tomatoes, mango, avocado, bell pepper, and chicken. Pour in dressing and toss well to coat. Serve with mint.
