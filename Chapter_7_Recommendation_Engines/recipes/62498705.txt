Ingredients:
2.5-3 lbs ground pork, ground chuck or ground turkey (don’t use ground beef)
1 tablespoon garlic powder (or 2 fresh minced)
1 tablespoon onion powder
¾ teaspoon ground fennel seed (better if ground fresh from seed)
2 teaspoons paprika (1 tbs for medium)
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes	(1 tbs for medium)
1 tablespoon freshly cracked black or white pepper
1 tablespoon salt
1 1/4 tablespoons dried parsley (2 ½ tbs fresh chopped Italian parsley)
1/8 teaspoon oregano
1 tablespoon basil
1/8 teaspoon thyme
¼ teaspoon brown sugar
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Directions:
Put meat in mixing bowl to warm up a bit while you prepare dry ingredients (makes it easier to mix). Push meat down into bowl in order to evenly cover with ingredients. Mix all dry ingredients in a small mixing bowl. Place all wet ingredients directly in meat bowl. Mix thoroughly until you see that ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout meat.
If wanting to use fresh I recommend covering and storing in the fridge for at least 12 hours before cooking. Roll into log and wrap with plastic wrap, or store in freezer safe container (I always wrap first and then put into a freezer bag or plastic container to help prevent freezer burn. For easy patties pull log out of freezer and thaw. You can use a finely serrated knife to cut right through wrapping into ¼ to ½ inch slices, or use same as you would ground chuck as meat product. I use it for patties, spaghetti meat, meatballs, etc.
