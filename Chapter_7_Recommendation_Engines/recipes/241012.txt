Ingredients:
2 Haas avocados - peeled, pitted, and cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 lime, juiced, divided
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cups chopped leafy green lettuce, or more to taste
1/4 cup very thinly sliced red onion

Directions:
Toss avocado slices with 1/2 of the lime juice in a bowl.
Mash 3 avocado slices with a fork in a bowl. Whisk mashed avocado slices, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy.
Pour lettuce into a large salad bowl. Arrange avocado slices over lettuce and sprinkle red onion over the top. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve salad with dressing on the side.

Description: 
Not only are avocados delicious, they are one of the best vegetables out there. Low in cholesterol and sodium, a good source of dietary fiber, high in Vitamin C, Vitamin K and folate, and they are moderately anti-inflammatory. I like to serve the dressing on the side to keep portion sizes in check. With this salad, since the avocados are already slightly marinated in lime juice, you really don't need much more than a couple tablespoons of the vinaigrette to add the zing necessary to bring this salad alive. Enjoy with my low calorie-biscuits and you have a very satisfying and waist-trimming meal!
