Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups boiling water
1/2 cup raisins
2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup Butter Flavor CRISCO® Shortening
4 eggs
1 (16 ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 teaspoon salt
Orange Glaze:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 teaspoon grated orange peel
4 teaspoons orange juice
Chopped walnuts

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 10-inch (12-cup) Bundt pan with Butter Flavor CRISCO(R). Flour lightly.
Pour boiling water over raisins in colander. Drain. Press lightly to remove excess water.
Combine granulated sugar, melted CRISCO(R) Shortening, pumpkin and eggs in large bowl. Beat at medium-high speed of electric mixer 5 minutes.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, salt and cloves in medium bowl. Add to pumpkin mixture, 1 cup at a time, beating at low speed after each addition until blended. Stir in raisins with spoon. Pour into pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 to 50 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 15-20 minutes before removing from pan. Place cake, top side up, on wire rack. Cool completely. Place cake on serving plate.
Combine confectioners' sugar, orange peel and orange juice in small bowl. Stir with spoon to blend. Spoon over top of cake, letting excess glaze run down side. Sprinkle with chopped nuts before glaze hardens.
