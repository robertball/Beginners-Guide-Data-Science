Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
4 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/4 tsp ground cloves
1 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp ground ginger
2 eggs
2 cups milk
1 cup maple syrup
2 tbsp vegetable oil

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients.  In another bowl, combine the eggs, milk, syrup and oil.  Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened (batter will be thin).  Pour into two greased 9x5x3 loaf pans.  Bake at 325 for 60-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans onto wire racks.

Description: 
Enjoy the old-fashioned appeal of gingerbread in a loaf with this recipe originally from Holland. This moist, spicy bread smells wonderful while baking, and slices go well with cream cheese.  Makes a great holiday gift and freezes well too!
