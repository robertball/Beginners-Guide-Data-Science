Ingredients:
For the seitan dough:
1 cup of vital wheat gluten (I use Hodgeson Mill found in Walmart's flour aisle)
3 Tbsp of nutritional yeast
1/2 cup of vegetable broth
1/4 cup of liquid aminos (I use Braggs)
1 Tbsp oilve oil
1/2 Tbsp minced garlic
**************************************************
For the broth to cook the seitan in:
4 cups of vegetable broth and 4 cups of water
1/4 cup of tamari

Directions:
Mix all of the seitan dough ingredients together and once it forms a ball, put the spoon away and squash it around really well with your hands to "knead" it. It should be almost rubbery. Form it into a ball allow it to rest while you make up the pot of broth, water, and tamari to cook your seitan patties. Once you have the big saucepot of broth going, divide your seitan dough into three equal pieces and squeeze/pat/press/stretch the dough into three patties no thicker than your average "hamburger" patty. Set those aside to wait until the broth is boiling.
Once the broth is boiling, drop the patties in carefully and cover to return the liquid to a boil. Watch it carefully until it does, you don't want the patties to stick to the bottom, or each other, and you don't want it to cook at a boil for too long or the seitan ends up with a weird "kitchen sponge" texture rather than a "meat" texture.
When the broth has returned to a boil, turn down the heat to s gentle simmer and leave the cover ajar (or vent it) so the steam can escape and it simmers nicely and evenly. You will let the patties simmer in the broth bath for about an hour, turning occasionally with a large mesh or slotted ladle, and then remove the pot from the heat, leave the cover off, and let the patties cool for 15 minutes in the broth.
You can now either slice and use your seitan (makes about 1 lb) or you can store it in an airtight container covered with the broth you cooked the patties in. Do NOT discard the broth though! It makes a SUPER rich soup base!
