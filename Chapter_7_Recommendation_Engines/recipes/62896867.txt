Description: 
German Spaetzle, When I was in Germany back in 1976 I went to a restaurant and ordered a dish that cam with Spaetzle. I loved it so much I went to the store and bought a Spaetzle press. I have now had that same press for over 35 years and is my go to noodle for use as a side. I normaly serve it with gravy or butter. You can also Add meat to it, and top with a gravy for a complete dish.
