Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup skim milk
3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon
4 slices whole wheat bread, light -- cubed
2 small apples -- peeled, cored, and diced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons margarine

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Spray two 5 x 3" loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs; blend with milk, 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon. Add the bread cubes and the apples, stirring gently; let stand until the bread absorbs all the liquid, 2-3 minutes.
To make the topping, in a small bowl, combine with a fork the flour, the remaining 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, the margarine and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon.
Divide the bread mixture between the loaf pans; sprinkle with the topping. Bake until golden brown, 35-40 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm.
