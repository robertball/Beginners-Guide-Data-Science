Ingredients:
25 toothpicks
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes (not oil-packed)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or amount to taste
1 pinch salt
25 fresh jalapeno peppers
1 pound thinly sliced bacon

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate. Soak toothpicks 20 minutes in water.
Place the cream cheese in a bowl, and mix in the garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and salt until evenly blended.
Make one slit from end to end in the side of each jalapeno pepper, and scoop out the seeds. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the center of each pepper. Wrap 1 piece of bacon around each pepper, and secure with a toothpick.
Place the peppers onto the preheated grill, and cook until peppers begin to soften, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
My husband and his friends love to munch on these when they get together to watch basketball or football. Warning!!! These are NOT for the taster who's mild at heart!! You can also bake the peppers in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes; broil 1 to 2 minutes to crisp the bacon. Red or yellow bell peppers cam be substituted to lower the heat.
