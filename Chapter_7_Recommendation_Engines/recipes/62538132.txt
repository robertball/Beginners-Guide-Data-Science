Ingredients:
2 cups diced celery, with leaves
6 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup minced onion
1/2 cup butter
2 bag of bread cubes
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 teaspoon sage
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 teaspoon poultry seasoning

Directions:
Melt butter in saucepan. Saute onion and celery in melted butter until soft, but not brown. Place bread cubes into large mixing bowl. Add salt, pepper, sage, and thyme. Add onion, celery and broth. Combine thoroughly. If still too dry, add more chicken broth. Should be very very moist but not so much broth that it is not soaked up by the bread cubes. Makes enough to stuff a 10 to 15 pound turkey but I spread in a greased 9x13 pan cover with foil and refrigerate over night.   Remove foil bake at 350 for 35 to 40 min.
