Ingredients:
Salmon:
2 cups Chablis or other dry white wine
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon chicken-flavored bouillon granules
6 peppercorns
4 sprigs fresh dillweed
2 bay leaves
1 rib celery, chopped
1 small lemon, sliced
6 (4 ounce) fillets salmon, 1/2 inch thick
Cucumber-Dill Sauce:
1/3 cup peeled, seeded, and finely chopped cucumber
1/3 cup fat-free sour cream
1/3 cup fat-free plain yogurt
2 teaspoons chopped fresh dillweed
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
Fresh dillweed sprigs (optional)

Directions:
To make the salmon: Combine the wine, water, bouillon, peppercorns, dillweed, bay leaves, celery, and lemon in a skillet. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the salmon to the mixture in the skillet and cook for 10 minutes or until the fish flakes easily.
Transfer the salmon to a platter, using a slotted spoon. Cover, and chill thoroughly. Discard the liquid mixture remaining in the skillet.
To make the cucumber-dill sauce: In a medium bowl, mix together the cucumber, sour cream, yogurt, dillweed, and mustard.
To serve, place the fillets on individual serving plates. Spoon the sauce evenly over the fillets. Garnish with fresh dillweed sprigs, if using.
