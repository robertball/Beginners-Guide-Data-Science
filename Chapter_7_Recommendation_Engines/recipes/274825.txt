Ingredients:
2 (14.75 ounce) cans salmon
1/2 red bell pepper, minced
1/4 cup minced sweet onion
3/4 cup bread crumbs
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon dried mustard powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Place a colander on top of a bowl; add salmon to the colander and separate fish a bit to allow it to drain. Let stand until well drained, about 10 minutes. Discard juice and transfer salmon to a large bowl.
Mix bell pepper and onion into the salmon. Add bread crumbs, eggs, soy sauce, Sriracha, ginger, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, mustard powder, and garlic powder; mix to combine. Form into 5 patties. Place patties on a cookie sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator, 1 hour to overnight.
Heat vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Gently place burgers into the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook, turning just once, until well browned, 7 to 9 minutes per side. Place cooked burgers on a serving platter.
