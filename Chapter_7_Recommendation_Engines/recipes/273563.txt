Ingredients:
3/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/2 cup chopped scallions
1/4 cup ketchup
1 1/2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
1 pound beef flank steak, trimmed of excess fat

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, scallions, ketchup, sesame oil, and garlic in a large resealable plastic bag. Add flank steak, seal, and refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove steak from bag, and discard marinade. Grill steak 6 minutes on each side for medium rare or until desired degree of doneness. Remove from grill. Tent with foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut diagonally across the grain into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices.

Description: 
This is a very easy, wonderful solution for flank steak. It is a salty, savory sauce that combines tenderness with flavor. Great for teenage boys and large gatherings. So easy that I prepare in morning and grill when I get home from work! Do not substitute the sesame oil, it is essential for the flavor.
