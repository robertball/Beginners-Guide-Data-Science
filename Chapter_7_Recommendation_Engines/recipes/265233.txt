Description: 
I love making these Chinese pineapple buns (bolo bao). They're my favorite treat. Being Chinese, my parents would always go to the Chinese bakery during the weekend and buy these to eat for breakfast or for a snack. Now that I learned how to make these myself, it has saved a lot of money.
