10 Large Marshmallows
about 4-5 baby Carrots
about 1/2 cup peanut butter / chocolate chips

First clean baby carrots and then slice them lengthwise in quarters or thinner slices, depending of the baby carrot. Also peel and slice apple into thin slices (if you like apple peel you can leave it on). Now take large marshmallow and put two carrot pieces on the side, sort of like arms.
