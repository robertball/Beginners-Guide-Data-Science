Ingredients:
4 pounds chicken pieces
1 cup bourbon
2 TB fresh lemon juice
salt
1 cup flour seasoned with 1 tsp salt
1/2 cup melted margarine
1/2 tsp ground white pepper
1/4 tsp ground marjoram
Lemon slices for garnish

Directions:
Preheat over to 425.  Toss together chicken, bourbon, lemon juice and pinch of salt.  Marinate for at least two hours.  Remove the chicken from the marinade and toss each piece in the seasoned flour to coat well.  Pour the marinade in a large, shallow baking dish and arrange the chicken in one layer on top of it.
Drizzle with the melted butter and sprinkle with pepper and marjoram and bake for 45 minutes to an hour or until brown and crispy.  Garnish with lemon slices and serve with mashed potatoes.
