Ingredients:
This healthy chicken recipe is a great alternative to frying.
What you will need:
2 tsp olive oil
2 (up to 3) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 large tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup creamy caesar dressing
1/4 tsp Tabasco or other hot sauce
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Preparation
Heat oil in a wide frying pan set over medium-high heat. When hot, add chicken.
Cook until lightly browned, turning once, from 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add tomatoes, dressing and Tabasco.
Stir, then cover and simmer, turning chicken once, until chicken is springy and juices run clear, from 10 to 12 minutes.
Stir in basil, salt and pepper to taste.
Serve with a side of couscous, fresh steamed green beans, or other fresh veggies of your choice.

Here is the recipe I told you about last night.  I didn't use that much Basil because it seemed like a lot for two pieces of chicken.
