Ingredients:
4-5 strips bacon
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups rice, uncooked
1 large can (about 2 cups) Black-eyed peas, with juices
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
1 tsp black pepper
Hot sauce (Tabasco or other) to taste

Directions:
Fry bacon in skillet until brown and crisp.
Chop fried bacon slices, and set aside.
Pour off bacon grease and retain 2 Tbs for later step.
In the film of bacon grease in the skillet, saute chopped onions until trasnparent and slightly golden on edges.  Remove from grease and set aside.
In a stock pot, add all ingredients, including onions and bacon, and the 2 Tbs of bacon grease.
Bring mixture to a boil, stirring.  Once it boils, turn heat to low, cover the pot and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until liquids are absorbed and rice is tender.  Do NOT stir during the simmering.  Opening the pot will release heat and steam and interfere with the rice cooking properly.
Once the rice is tender, remove the pot from the heat, stir well and remove to serving dish.
Garnish with parsley if desired.
Serve with hot sauce on the side, if desired.

Description: 
Southerners love legumes and rice.  This is a classic way to serve Black-eyed Peas and rice.  The superstition, in many Southern areas, is that eating Black-eyed Peas on New Years Day brings good luck for the coming year.This is about the only way I will eat Black-eyed peas!
