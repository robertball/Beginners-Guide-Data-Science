Ingredients:
½ cup fresh lime juice
1 ½ tablespoons fish sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1  red grapefruit, peeled and sectioned
2 cups shelled cooked tiny shrimp, thawed if frozen
2 cups shredded precooked chicken breast meat
1 ½ cups shredded coconut meat, unsweetened
6  shallots, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon chopped red chile pepper
½ cup fresh mint leaves
1 ½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 head iceberg lettuce, shredded

Directions:
Make the dressing by whisking together the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and garlic in a bowl.
Toss together the sectioned grapefruit, shrimp, chicken breast, coconut, shallots, chile pepper, mint, and cilantro in a large bowl. Drizzle approximately 3/4 of the dressing into the grapefruit mixture and toss to combine. Combine the remaining dressing with the shredded lettuce in a separate bowl shortly before serving.
Arrange the lettuce on a large platter. Layer the grapefruit mixture on top of the lettuce.

Description: 
This is my combination of 'Thai Yam Som-O' and a marinated-shrimp and coconut salad I had at Bellagio's. If pomelo is available in your area, use it in place of the grapefruit.
