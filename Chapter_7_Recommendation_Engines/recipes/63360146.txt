Ingredients:
1 package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Trader Joe's Island Soyaki Sauce
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons curry powder

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter and sauté chicken breast tenders until they are browned.  Turn and sauté the other side.
In a small bowl, mix the remaining ingredients together.  Turn heat down to low and pour the sauce over the chicken in the skillet.
Stir until the sauce thickens and gives the chicken a glaze.

Description: 
Inspired by my first trip to Trader Joe's, and by other AR peeps, I have created an easy but elegant gourmet chicken recipe using some of Trader Joe's unique ingredients.   Pair this dish with roasted vegetables and risotto and you would have an excellent gourmet meal for Valentine's Day or a romantic dinner.  Serve it any time you want to impress your guests or loved ones.
