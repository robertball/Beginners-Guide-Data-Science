Ingredients:
1 lb. skinless sea bass, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
1/2-1 cup lime juice
1/2 small red onion, diced
1 large jalapeno, stemmed and finely chopped
1/4 cup small Manzanillo olives (stuffed with pimento), finely chopped
1 large ripe tomato, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4 inch pieces
1/3 large jicama, peeled and chopped into 1/4 inch pieces
1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro
Salt
3 tbsp orange juice
Tortilla chips, for serving

Directions:
Cook the fish in the juice: In a large stainless steel or glass bowl, combine the fish and lime juice. The fish should be covered in the lime juice - little bits peeking out from the top is fine. Cover and refrigerate for 2 1/2 hours (for medium doneness).
Take the fish out of the refrigerator and tip off the lime juice.
Flavor the ceviche: In a bowl, combine the chopped red onion, jalapeno, Mananillos, tomato and jicama. Mix well.
Place the fresh chopped cilantro into the bowl along with the salt and orange juice. Mix well to combine again.
Place into a serving bowl with the tortilla chips and enjoy!
The ceviche can be refrigerated for an hour before serving.

Description: 
This citrus marinated and cooked seafood appetizer is so delicious with its crisp and refreshing flavor. All the different colors (very Mexican) come together beautifully! I liked serving the ceviche with blue corn tortilla chips.
