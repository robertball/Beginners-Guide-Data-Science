Ingredients:
2 eggs, room temperature
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups shredded carrots
1/2 cup drained crushed pineapple
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Beat eggs, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl. Mix in oil and vanilla extract. Fold in carrots, pineapple, and coconut.
Mix flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger together in another bowl. Add to the carrot mixture and mix until evenly moist. Transfer batter to the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
My friends and family love them. They are so moist! They go great with my dairy-free cream cheese frosting. After they cool, top with frosting and shredded coconut.
