Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
1 Tbsp. Vanilla
Snow, about a gallon

Directions:
Cook the sugar, eggs & milk in a pan over LOW heat, stirring almost continuously until it thickens and you can coat the back of the spoon w/ the mixture. Set aside to cool.
Once cooled to room tempature add the vanilla. Put in fridge until enough snow accumulates. :)
Give each child a bowl of snow, realizing that it will lose 1/2 of it's volume. Add a good sized dollop of custard to each bowl and let the kids mix until desired consistency. You may have to add more snow or custard.
Eat immediately!!!
