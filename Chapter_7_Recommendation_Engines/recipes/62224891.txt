Ingredients:
4 thin chicken breasts (about 1 lb)
1/2 c flour
1/2 cup whole grain bread crumbs
2 tsp rubbed sage
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper
1 egg, beaten
1/8 c olive oil

Directions:
Mix together the flour, bread crumbs, sage, coriander, nutmeg, and fresh pepper and spread onto a plate.
Beat the egg in a low, wide bowl (big enough to dip the chicken breasts).
Coat each chicken breast in a thin layer of egg and dredge in the flour mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat until shiny but not smoking.
Place the coated chicken breasts into the pan and fry about 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through.

Description: 
I made this using both real chicken for my boyfriend and a vegetarian chicken cutlet for myself. It has a lot of flavor while staying reasonably healthy, which I love!
