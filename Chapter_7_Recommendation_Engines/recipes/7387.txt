Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
6 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
2 cups whipped cream
1 fresh pineapple, peeled and cored
12 maraschino cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Sift the cake flour and baking powder together.
Separate the eggs, put the egg yolks into a large bowl and the egg whites into a small bowl. With an electric mixer beat the egg yolks until thick and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in 3/4 cup of the white sugar. Add the lemon juice and pineapple juice. Add the sifted cake flour mixture gradually while continually beating. Beat only until just blended (about 1 1/2 minutes).
With an electric mixer beat the egg whites with the salt until moist peaks form (about 1 minute). Gradually beat in 3/4 cup of the white sugar (about 50 seconds).
Fold the beaten egg whites into the batter and mix only until blended. Pour batter into an ungreased 10 inch tube pan. With a knife or spatula gently cut through batter going round in a circular motion six times to release any air bubbles.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 1 hour or until golden brown and firm to the touch. Invert pan on rack to cool. Once cake is cool loosen sides with a spatula and remove from pan. Frost cake with whipped cream and garnish with wedges of pineapple and maraschino cherries.
