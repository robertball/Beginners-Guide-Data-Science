Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
1 cucumber - peeled, seeded, and diced
1 tomato, diced
1 cup cooked small shrimp
1 cup Italian salad dressing
1 cup mayonnaise, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
Transfer warm macaroni into a large salad bowl and gently mix in celery, onion, cucumber, tomato, shrimp, and Italian salad dressing; refrigerate at least 1 hour (up to overnight for best flavor). Gently fold mayonnaise into salad and serve.

Description: 
My mom threw this together for a family gathering one year at the last minute, and it is now the single most requested dish at every gathering...family or not! Wonderful shrimp and pasta salad that satisfies the carb crave and is healthier than some of the other options we have these days. Great for backyard barbecue with friends or a quiet dinner inside with family. Serve chilled. Add vinegar for an extra tang! Feel free to add olives, peppers, or whatever veggies you love. This recipe is very flexible and forgiving.
