1 pound pork sausage
5 cups cabbage, shredded
1 cup onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Roll out dough to 1/4 inch in thickness, then cut into 5 inch squares.
In a large skillet, cook beef and sausage over medium heat until browned; make sure there is no remaining pink color.
Stir in cabbage, onions and salt with meat. Saute for about 20 minutes. Turn down heat to warm.
Fill each dough square with a tablespoon of meat filling. Seal dough by bringing the four corners up and then overlapping them. Place pastry upside down on a baking sheet; brush each roll with melted butter.
Allow rolls to rise for 1 hour and then bake at 350ยบ  for 25 minutes.
