Ingredients:
4 duck breast halves
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
4 firm apples, sliced
1 cup Calvados (apple brandy)

Directions:
Place duck breasts skin-side down in a nonstick skillet over high heat; cook for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
Melt butter in a separate skillet over high heat. Add apples; cook and stir until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; pour in Calvados. Cook and stir over low heat, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until alcohol evaporates, about 1 minute.
Serve duck breasts with Calvados sauce.

Description: 
Succulent duck breasts, butter, apples and calvados - just four ingredients make up this fabulous dish. I just made this recipe tonight and it was so good... I had my husband's seal of approval who could not wait to eat it while I was taking the picture. The sweet and sour taste is very nice. I think I'll do it again for Christmas.
