Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups grated carrots

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.
Beat the oil and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the oil mixture before adding the next.
Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; beat into the wet mixture. Fold grated carrots through the batter, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
