Ingredients:
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 pound cabbage
For the Dressing:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon coarse-grain mustard
1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Halve and quarter the head of cabbage and cut out the core. Slice across into 1/2-inch ribbons. Place cabbage in a bowl and sprinkle in salt. Massage cabbage until it begins to soften, about 1 minute. Let rest for 10 minutes, tossing occasionally. Transfer cabbage to a colander and rinse well under cold water. Let drain thoroughly.
Mix mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, grain mustard, honey, cayenne pepper, and vinegar together in a large bowl.
Squeeze cabbage as dry as possible and add to the dressing. Mix until thoroughly combined. Cover top in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Toss and taste before serving.

Description: 
I enjoy a wide variety of coleslaws, but this mustard slaw may be my fave. The combo of hot and sweet has a proven track record for pleasing palates. Salting and massaging your cabbage first (aka 'cassage') will help draw out water, which sweetens up the flavor, as well as produce a flexible, yet still crunchy texture, which I think is lacking in many other 'chop and mix' recipes. Garnished here with chives and chive blossoms.
