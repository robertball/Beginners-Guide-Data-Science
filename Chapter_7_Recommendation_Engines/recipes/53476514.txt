7 ounces basil pesto
30 ounces ricotta cheese (substituted cottage cheese)

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In large skillet over medium heat, saute onion in the olive oil until tender.  Add spinach and stir. Remove from heat and stir in the pesto. In a large bowl mix ricotta cheese, egg, salt, pepper and nutmeg.
