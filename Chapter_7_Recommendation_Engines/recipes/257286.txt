Ingredients:
1 vanilla bean
1 teaspoon Urfa biber (Turkish chile pepper)
6 cups milk
1 cinnamon stick
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup whipped cream, or to taste
1 tablespoon grated bittersweet chocolate

Directions:
Split vanilla bean lengthwise with the tip of a sharp knife. Place Urfa biber in a tea infuser.
Combine vanilla bean, Urfa biber, milk, and cinnamon stick in a pot.
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until milk is steaming and small bubbles appear, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove Urfa biber. Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate and sugar; stir until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Remove cinnamon stick and vanilla bean.
Pour into cups and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with bittersweet chocolate.
