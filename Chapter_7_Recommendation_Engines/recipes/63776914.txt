Ingredients:
Ingredients for the Meatballs
• 1 pound ground beef
• 1/2 pound ground pork (you can use all ground beef)
• 1 cup shredded cauliflower
• 1/4 cup shredded zucchini
• 2 teaspoons sea salt
• 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
• 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
• 2 tablespoons chopped onion (I used frozen)
• 2 tablespoon olive oil
Ingredients for the Soup
• 2 large cloves garlic (2-3 tablespoons)
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1/4 cup chopped onion (I used frozen)
• 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes (San Marzano)
• 3 cups low sodium chicken broth
• 2 tablespoons tomato paste (I used from a tube)
• 1 teaspoon sea salt
• 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
• 1 bay leaf
• 1 medium cabbage, core removed (4 cups)
• 1/2 lemon juiced, about 2 teaspoons

Directions:
Take out your large cast iron pan. I love to use my Le Creuset Oval French Oven
For the meatballs: In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, cauliflower/zucchini, salt, pepper, cumin and onions. Form into 1-inch balls. Heat your soup pot and add in olive oil. Sauté until all sides are brown. About 7 minutes. Remove any excess grease.
For the soup: If you need an extra olive oil add it now if not: Add the onions and sweat until translucent then add in garlic about 3 minutes. Next add in crushed tomatoes, chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add in tomato pasta and stir with a spoon to mix into liquid. Add salt and pepper. Cover and lower to medium and cook for about 10 minutes.
Take cabbage and remove core and inner white part. Cut into thin slices and add to the pot. Cover and set temperature to a medium/low for 20 minutes.
Add in lemon juice and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
Enjoy with your favorite garnishes or toppings!

Description: 
Here we go again with my one-pot meals. I love stuffed cabbage and have all the ingredients to make one but with the snow we are getting in Connecticut I decided to make soup. This Paleo recipes is delicious and I hope you try and enjoy my un-stuffed cabbage soup.
I only used about 1/4 head of cauliflower and 1/2 of a zucchini. Shredded through my food processor and the measurement was 1 1/4 cup total. That amount seemed perfect for 1 1/2 pounds of meat. If you use more then add more of the cauliflower/zucchini mixture.
