Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
cooking spray
2 ½ cups chopped, cooked chicken
2 (10 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (7 ounce) container pesto
¾ cup chopped, drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) jar diced pimento peppers
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 3 1/2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.
Drain pasta and place in a large bowl. Add cooked chicken, cream of chicken soup, artichoke hearts, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and pimento peppers; mix to combine. Spoon pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.
