Description: 
I have many rhubarb plants and can only pass off so much to family and friends.  Once I tried these rich gooey bars, I just had to have the recipe so I could use up that extra produce and pawn that off to family and friends.. The shortbread-like crust and rhubarb and custard layers inspire people to find rhubarb they can use to fix a batch for themselves.
