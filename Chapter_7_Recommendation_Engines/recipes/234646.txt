Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 (30 ounce) can pumpkin pie filling (such as Libby'sÂ®)
3 cups white sugar, or more to taste
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
4 large eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 330 degrees F (166 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk pumpkin pie filling, sugar, oil, water, and eggs together in a separate bowl until just mixed. Stir flour mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into pumpkin mixture until batter is just combined. Fill muffin cups with batter just below the brims.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool muffins on a wire rack.

Description: 
I made this recipe this fall when I was craving something seasonal. After trying other recipes that just lacked that homey pumpkin-pie taste, I decided to make my own. 

It makes about 24 large muffins or 6 muffins and a loaf. Even though they last well in the refrigerator, you may want to halve the recipe for individuals or small families. Add some cream cheese frosting and they'd make great cupcakes.
