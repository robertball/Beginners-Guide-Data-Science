Ingredients:
1.5 tbsp salted butter
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
1 container sliced fresh mushrooms, chopped (or minced in food processor if you're like me and don't like the texture of mushrooms!)
1 tbsp soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
1 tbsp dijon mustard
1-1.5 cups low sodium chicken broth
Olive oil
1 lb ground turkey
salt
pepper
1-1.5 cups sour cream
1 lemon
fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped (for garnish)
noodles or zoodles

Directions:
In a large skillet, melt butter.  Add garlic and onion and saute for about 2 min.  Add mushrooms and saute for another 8-10 minutes.  Remove from skillet and put into a bowl.  Add soy sauce, dijon mustard, 1 cup of  chicken broth to bowl, salt, and pepper.
Mix well.  Set aside.
In skillet, heat up a tbsp of olive oil.  Brown the turkey meat - don't overcook, as it will cook more in a few minutes.  Once turkey is browned, add mushroom mixture.  Simmer for about 7 minutes, or until sauce starts to reduce and thicken.
Stir in sour cream.  Let it simmer for a little longer if it needs to thicken.
Serve over noodles or zoodles.  Garnish with parsley and lemon juice.
