Ingredients:
CAKE ROLL:
3 eggs
1 cup sugar
2/3 cup pumpkin
1 tsp lemon juice
3/4 cup flour
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup chopped nuts
1/3 cup powdered sugar
FILLING:
8 ounces cream cheese
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
2 cups powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.   Grease 12x18 jelly roll pan.
Beat 3 eggs at high speed for about 3 minutes.  Gradually beat in sugar.  Stir in pumpkin, lemon juice, flour and spices.   Spread on a large jelly roll pan.  Top with chopped nuts.
Bake for 15 minutes.  If top feels sticky, either leave in the oven a little longer or turn on the broiler.    Turn out onto a cloth sprinkled with powdered sugar.   Roll up in cloth and let cool until slightly warm but not cold.
While the cake cools, beat together all ingredients for the filling.
Unroll cake, spread with filling and re-roll without the cloth.
Wrap in wax paper or foil until ready to serve.
To freeze, wrap in wax paper AND foil.
