Ingredients:
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 28 ounce can whole plum tomatoes - drained
1/4 large red onion
4 to 8 fresh jalapenos seeded
4 cloves garlic
1/4 cup cilantro
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Use blender or Ninja
Add all ingredients
Pulse until well blended
(Since all jalapenos don't have the same heat, I start with 4, blend, let rest for a half our or so and taste.  Add more as needed to get to desired heat.  Since it is a blended salsa, it doesn't change the consistency when blended more.)

Description: 
This is a fresh blended  salsa with lots of flavor.  You can adjust it to your heat preference by using more or less Jalapenos.  This is a staple at all of our summer parties.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
