Ingredients:
1 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
1 cup white grape juice
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup chopped green onions
1/3 cup sesame seeds, toasted
2 tablespoons ground mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons pepper
8 cloves garlic, minced
12 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first nine ingredients. Remove 1/2 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Add chicken to the bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 6-8 hours.
Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 6 minutes. Turn and cook 6-8 minutes longer or until met juices run clear, basting occasionally with the reserved marinade.

Description: 
Chicken gets a lovely treatment from a soy marinade and basting sauce in this recipe from Catherine Allan of Twin Falls, Idaho. 'The flavor you get from grilling really says summer,' she notes. Enjoy some chicken for dinner and use the extra in the two recipes that follow.
