Ingredients:
12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
4 cups whole milk
4 large eggs
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups granulated white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 French baguette, cut into cubes*
1 cup raisins

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla.
In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cocoa. Add to the milk mixture and whisk. Add the bread, raisins, and chocolate chips. Mix well.
Refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes, until the bread has absorbed most of the liquid. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish. Mix the bread pudding once more to evenly distribute the chips and raisins. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 1 hour, or until set. Serve the pudding warm, or refrigerate and serve chilled.
