Ingredients:
4 heads baby bok choy
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons capers
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 dash fresh lemon juice, or to taste

Directions:
Separate the leaves from the stems of the bok choy. Cut the stems into bite-sized chunks and shred the leaves.
Heat the olive oil in large skillet over medium heat.
Cook the bok choy stems in the oil until slightly tender, about 3 minutes; add the water and leaves and cook until the water evaporates, about 10 minutes more. Stir in the capers, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir 1 minute more. Sprinkle the vinegar and lemon juice over the bok choy and remove from heat; serve immediately.
