Ingredients:
Vegetable oil, for frying
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 cup broccoli florets
1 medium carrot, cut in matchsticks
1 red pepper, cut into strips
1 cup vegetable broth
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons red chili flakes
1 teaspoon chili powder
5 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces spaghetti noodles
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Heat veggie oil & sesame oil in a wok over medium heat. Add broccoli and carrot and cook for 10 minutes, until slightly tender. Add red pepper and reduce heat a little.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until tender according to package directions. Drain.
While spaghetti is cooking, measure out sauce ingredients in a 2-cup measuring cup (don't worry about stirring). Add to wok and stir.
Add pasta and stir until peanut butter is melted and noodles are covered with sauce. Stir in green onion just before serving.
