Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups cold fat free milk
1 pkg. (4 serving size) JELL-O Vanilla Flavor Fat Free Sugar Free Instant Reduced Calorie Pudding & Pie Filling
1 cup thawed COOL WHIP LITE Whipped Topping
2 cups raspberries
2 tablespoons powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in medium bowl with electric mixer on high speed 5 min. or until soft peaks form. Gradually add granulated sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating on high speed until stiff peaks form.
Spoon onto baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Using large spoon, make 10-inch circle of meringue, indenting slightly in the center of the circle to form a 'crust.' Bake 1-1/2 hours. Cool.
Pour milk into large bowl. Add dry pudding mix. Beat with wire whisk 2 min. or until well blended. Gently stir in whipped topping. Refrigerate 15 min. or until slightly thickened. Place meringue on serving plate. Spoon pudding mixture over meringue, leaving a border of meringue showing around edge. Spoon raspberries over pudding; sprinkle with powdered sugar.
