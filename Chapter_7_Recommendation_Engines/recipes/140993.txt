Ingredients:
2 heads garlic, unpeeled
5 bay leaves
2 (3 ounce) packages dry crab boil
1 tablespoon liquid shrimp and crab boil seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
3 large oranges, halved
3 large lemons, halved
2 large whole artichokes
15 red potatoes, washed
30 pieces baby corn
2 large onions, sliced
2 (16 ounce) packages mushrooms, cleaned
1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
2 (16 ounce) packages smoked sausage, cut into 1/2 inch slices
50 live crawfish, rinsed

Directions:
Fill a very large pot about 1/3 full with water. Add the garlic, bay leaves, dry and liquid crab boil seasonings, salt, pepper, oranges, lemons, artichokes, and potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.
Stir in the corn, onions, mushrooms, and green beans; cook 15 minutes more. Stir in the sausage; cook 5 minutes more. Add the crawfish, return mixture to boil, then simmer until the crawfish shells turn bright red and the tails pull out easily, about 5 minutes. Test for doneness by peeling a crawfish. Be sure not to overcook, or crawfish will become tough.
Drain well. Serve crawfish hot, Louisiana-style, spread over a picnic table covered with newspapers.
