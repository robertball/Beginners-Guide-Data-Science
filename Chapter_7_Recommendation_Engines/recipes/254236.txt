Ingredients:
Dipping Sauce:
2 shallots, minced
1 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup sake
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon diced ginger root
Batter:
1 cup rice flour
1 cup seltzer water
1 egg yolk
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 cup rice flour
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Mix shallots, soy sauce, sake, hot pepper sauce, cilantro, and ginger together in a bowl; let sit, about 2 hours.
Mix 1 cup rice flour, seltzer water, and egg yolk together in a bowl.
Split shrimp down the center, cutting almost but not completely through, and open flat. Pat with paper towel to dry; dust with 1/2 cup rice flour. Dip shrimp in batter until thoroughly covered.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook shrimp in small batches in oil until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Remove shrimp from oil and place on paper towel to absorb excess oil. Serves dipping sauce alongside the shrimp.
