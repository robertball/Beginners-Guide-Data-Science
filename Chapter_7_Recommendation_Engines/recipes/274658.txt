Description: 
This is my favorite rub to use when I smoke meats. I threw it together to use on smoked pork butt, but it also works really well on chicken and ribs. Apply liberally to meat and let sit overnight for best flavor. The brown sugar helps make a nice bark. Makes enough to cover two 8-pound pork butts or 6 racks of ribs.
