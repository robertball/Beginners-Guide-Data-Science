Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 bay leaves
2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup cilantro-not chopped

Directions:
Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. Coat pork with the spice mixture. Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.  Place cilantro in broth.
Cover and cook on Low, about 10 hours. Turn the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, separate into chunks, and place in a pre-heated 400 degree oven with some of its liquid for about 20 minutes. This will crisp it up and it will be like the fried carnitas you get in a restaurant.

Description: 
This low carb recipe is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and burritos. This filling is also great combined with your favorite barbecue sauce and served on buns. The last step is important to crisp the meat to make it more authenticModified from: Slow Cooker Carnitas
