Italian Tofu Meatballs Recipe

Ingredients:
1 14oz block of extra firm tofu
1 large egg
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 medium onion chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic (can be fresh or powder)
2 tablespoons Italian herb mix (basil, marjoram, rosemary, oregano, thyme) fresh or dry
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire or soy sauce
1/4 cup olive oil for drizzling

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400F
Place tofu between weighted plates or cookie sheets for 15 minutes to drain excess water. After, squeeze tofu over plate to get as much extra water out as possible (it's easier to break into small pieces and squeeze).
In a bowl combine all ingredients except olive oil and blend thoroughly with hands. There should not be any large pieces of tofu and the mixture should have an even color.
On a foil lined baking sheet, drizzle a small amount of olive oil to prevent sticking. This also helps crisp the bottoms. Using a measuring tablespoon form balls and arrange in rows on cookie sheet. Drizzle the tops with olive oil.
Bake for 25-30 minutes until brown and firm to the touch.

Description: 
They're the same as Italian meatballs but with tofu. I had to go through many recipes and cobble pieces together to get something that tasted normal. Olive oil helps them crisp in the oven.
