Description: 
This is an absolutely delicious sauce that is very versatile. We usually use it with Chinese steamed dumplings or pot stickers, but you can use it for sushi, egg rolls, vegetables, or even steak, chicken or shrimp.  I searched for a long time for a recipe that tastes like the one our favorite Chinese restaurant has. This is the result of tweaking several different recipes and it's even better!  This dipping sauce ROCKS and it's hands down the best dipping sauce I've ever had! You wonâ€™t be disappointed
