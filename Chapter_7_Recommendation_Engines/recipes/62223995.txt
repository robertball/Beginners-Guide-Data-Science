Ingredients:
2 TBS light sour cream
2 TBS minced fresh basil
1 TBS light cream cheese
1 clove garlic, minced
16 cherry tomatoes, halved

Directions:
Mix together sour cream, basil, cream cheese and garlic.
Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise.
Put cream mixture into a resealable plastic bag and snip of a tiny corner of the bag or a small frosting bag with a snall point.
Pipe cream mixture onto cut sides of tomatoes.
If you prefer you can just use a spoon and carefully place a snall amount of cream mixture on each tomato half. You may have to use a spoon or a larger point if you have added ingredients that will not go through the pipping point.

Description: 
I love the recipes I get from my subscription to Diabetic Living magazine. Here is one for little appetizer stuffed tomato halves. It just taste so great and leaves the door open to personalize the filling for the tomatoes. And being red, they look very festive.
