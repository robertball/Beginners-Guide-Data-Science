Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 (28 ounce) can plum tomatoes with juice, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggplant; cook, stirring constantly, until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice; cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
Pour sauce over pasta.
