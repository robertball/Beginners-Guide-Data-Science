Ingredients:
8 ounces portobello mushrooms, cleaned and stems cut
1 yellow onion, cut into wedges
1 zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch diagonal slices
1 yellow squash, sliced diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 orange bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/3 cup teriyaki baste and glaze
1 clove minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine mushrooms, onion, zucchini, yellow squash, and bell peppers in a large bowl. Add teriyaki, garlic, and ground pepper. Toss to thoroughly coat vegetables with the sauce; be gentle with the onion to keep it intact.
Place vegetables on the grill and cook, turning once, until vegetables begin to soften, 5 to 10 minutes.
