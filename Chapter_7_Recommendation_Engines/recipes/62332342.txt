Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons ketchup
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 (6-8 oz each) thick cut boneless pork loin chops

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first 10 ingredients; mix well. Pour half of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate 4 to 8 hours, turning occasionally. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Pre-heat grill to medium. Drain and discard marinade from meat.
Grill for about 8-10 minutes (depends upon thickness of the chops) on each side, basting with reserved marinade until juices run clear or a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees.
Let stand for 5 minutes. Serve with any remaining marinade if desired.
