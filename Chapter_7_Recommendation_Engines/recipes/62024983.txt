Ingredients:
3 chicken breast halves, cooked
6 oz. Philly cream cheese
12 oz. cheddar/jack cheese, shredded (divided)
1 1/2 cups picante sauce or salsa (divided)
12 corn tortillas, softened in hot oil
sour cream and avocado slices to garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Shred the cooked chicken breasts with two forks.  In a medium microwaveable bowl soften cream cheese on high 25 seconds; stir, then 25 more seconds on high until very creamy consistency.  Remove from microwave.  Add shredded chicken, 1/2 of the shredded cheese, and 1/2 cup picante sauce.  Stir until combined.  Spoon about 1/4 amount of chicken mixture down center of each tortilla.  Roll up and place, seam-side down in a greased 9x12 baking dish.  Cover with rest of picante sauce and rest of cheese.  Bake  350 degrees for 20-25 min.  Serve with sour cream and avocado slices.
