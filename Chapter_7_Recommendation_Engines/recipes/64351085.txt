Ingredients:
4 c. masa harina
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt 3 and 3/4 c. warm water or broth

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients together until moistened. Use or cover airtight and chill up to 2 hours. Follow directions for making tamales in a Mexican cookbook– this makes about 14 tamales and you’ll need 30 large cornhusks (about 3 oz.). (For each tamale you need a husk that makes an 8×10 rectangle.) Use about 1/3 c. masa for each. Use about 1/3 c. filling for each. Steam the tamales for 40-50 minutes. Serve with beans and salsa.
