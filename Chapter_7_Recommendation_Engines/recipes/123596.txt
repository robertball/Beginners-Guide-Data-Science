Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
3 tablespoons dried minced onion
3 tablespoons prepared mustard
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  Add milk, onion, mustard, oil, sugar, salt and 4 cups flour; beat until smooth.  Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down; divide into 24 pieces  Flatten each piece into a 3-in. circle.  Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.

Description: 
I'm an avid bread baker and was thrilled to find this recipe. It makes delectably different rolls that are a hit wherever I take them. The onion and mustard flavors go so well with ham or hamburgers and are special enough to serve alongside an elaborate main dish. -Melodie Shumaker, Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania
