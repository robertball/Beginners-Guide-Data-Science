Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 large fresh tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
6 eggs
4 pita bread rounds

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped tomatoes and garlic, stirring occasionally, until liquid has cooked out of the tomatoes. Carefully break eggs over tomatoes without breaking yolks. Lightly season with salt, reduce heat, and cover.
Simmer covered for 20 minutes, or until yolks are fully cooked. Adjust seasoning with salt as needed. Serve with pita pockets.

Description: 
An Arabic dish consisting of eggs, garlic and tomatoes. Taught to me by my ex-husband who is from Jordan.  DELICIOUS!  (I am guessing on the spelling of the title...)
