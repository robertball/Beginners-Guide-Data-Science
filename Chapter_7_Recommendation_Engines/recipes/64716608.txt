Ingredients:
2 bunches kale
4 ½ tbsp olive oil
1 shallot
1 lemon, juiced
Salt and pepper, to taste

Rinse the kale and pat dry.
Lay the leaves flat and remove the ribs and stems using a sharp knife.
Stack a few kale leaves on top of each other and slice crosswise into pieces about 1/2" wide.
Place the kale in a large bowl and set aside.
Peel and dice the shallot. Place in a small bowl.
Add the juice of 1 lemon to the shallot. (Be sure to remove the seeds.)
Add a few grinds of black pepper (about 5 twists on a grinder) and a pinch of salt.v
Slowly whisk the olive oil into the shallot mixture.
Pour the vinaigrette over the kale and lightly toss until the kale is well coated.
Add in some other goodies, if desired. (Toasted pine nuts, almonds, ricotta salata cheese, grated parmesan and dried cranberries are all great choices.)
Serve and enjoy alongside your favorite main dish.
