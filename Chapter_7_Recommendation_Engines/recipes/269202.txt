Ingredients:
1 teaspoon canola oil
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno, chopped
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup coconut milk, or more to taste
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
2 carrots, chopped
1 medium potato, peeled and chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 cup cauliflower florets, broken into bite size pieces

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and jalapeno peppers and cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in coriander, garam masala, cumin, paprika, and salt; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour tomato sauce into the pan and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes.
Add coconut milk and maple syrup and heat until warm. Taste sauce, adding more coconut milk or spices needed.
Add carrots, potato, bell pepper, and cauliflower florets to sauce; toss well to coat. Cover, and simmer until vegetables are crisp, but fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.
