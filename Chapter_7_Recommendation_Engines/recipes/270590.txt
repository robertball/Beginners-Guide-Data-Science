Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
1  onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, chopped
6 cups chicken stock
2 pounds whole skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed, or more to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced celery
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon adobo sauce from canned chipotles, or to taste (optional)
2  limes, juiced
1 (12 ounce) package tortilla strips
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
¼ cup sour cream, or as desired
1  avocado, diced, or to taste
1  fresh jalapeno pepper, sliced
2 tablespoons hot sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add oil, onion, and garlic. Saute until onion is soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add stock, chicken, beans, tomatoes, chiles, carrots, celery, salt, cumin, chili powder, oregano, and adobo sauce. Stir well. Close and lock the lid. Choose manual high pressure and set the timer for 17 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Remove chicken and shred using 2 forks. Return chicken to the pot. Season with lime juice and adjust salt, if necessary.
Ladle soup into bowls and top with tortilla strips, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, avocado, jalapeno pepper, and hot sauce.
