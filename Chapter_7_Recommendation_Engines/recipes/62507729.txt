Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/4 cup butter
1 (6.25 ounce) box stuffing mix
2 cups chopped apples
1/4 cup chopped celery
6 (1 1/4 inch) thick pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
6 slices bacon
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet saute onion in butter or margarine until tender. Remove from heat.
Add the stuffing mix, apples, and celery. Mix all together.
Cut a large pocket in the side of each pork chop; season inside and out with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon apple mixture loosely into pockets.
Wrap one slice of bacon around each pork chop and secure with a tooth pick.
In skillet, heat oil to medium high and brown chops on both sides. Place browned chops in an ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 20 minutes longer or until juices run clear.
