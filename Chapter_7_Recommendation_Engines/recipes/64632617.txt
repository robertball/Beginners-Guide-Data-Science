Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 cups all-purpose flour
2½ cups white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups grated carrots
2 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
2 cups raisins
2 egg
4 egg whites
1 cup apple butter
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
1/4 cup toasted wheat germ

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 °F. Coat 36 muffin cups or 100 mini-muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, egg whites, apple butter, oil and vanilla.
In a large bowl, stir together flours, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in carrots, apples and raisins. Stir in apple butter mixture until just moistened. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
In a small bowl, combine walnuts and wheat germ; sprinkle over the muffin tops.
Bake at 375 °F for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and spring back when lightly pressed
