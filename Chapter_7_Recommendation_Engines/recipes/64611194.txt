Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons honey
4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets (I used 4 7-oz fillets and there was still plenty of sauce)
Chopped green onion, for garnish
FOR THE SRIRACHA CREAM SAUCE
1/2 cup mayonnaise (I actually cut this back to 1/3 cup and it was plenty)
2-3 tablespoons Sriracha*
1 1/2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water; set aside.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, add soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic powder, honey and 1 cup water; bring to a simmer. Stir in cornstarch mixture until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes; let cool to room temperature.
In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine teriyaki marinade and salmon filets; marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat a glass baking dish with nonstick spray.
Place salmon filets along with the marinade into the prepared baking dish and bake until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 13-20 minutes, depending on size of filets.
While salmon is cooking, whisk together mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons Sriracha and condensed milk in a small bowl to make the Sriracha Cream Sauce; set aside.
When salmon has finished cooking, serve with Sriracha Cream Sauce drizzled on it.  Garnish with chopped green onions.

Description: 
Easy and really delicious! It is good even without the cream sauce as just teriyaki salmon.  Adapted from damndelicious.net/2012/05/30/teriyaki-salmon-with-sriracha-cream-sauce/.  Great with some jasmine rice with diced green onion tossed in it.
