Ingredients:
2 cups apple cider
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup whiskey (such as Jack Daniel's®)
3 tablespoons whiskey (such as Jack Daniel's®)
4 thick center-cut pork chops

Directions:
Stir apple cider, honey, cider vinegar, and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to low, stirring often, until the mixture reduces to 2/3 cup, about 20 minutes.
Simmer 1/3 cup whiskey in a separate small saucepan over medium-low heat until steam no longer smells of alcohol, about 10 minutes; stir into the apple cider mixture. Reduce this mixture to 1/2 cup, forming an apple cider glaze and cool.
Stir 3 tablespoons whiskey into apple cider glaze.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place pork chops into a baking dish; brush with the apple cider glaze.
Bake chops in the preheated oven, basting them often with glaze, until tender, about 1 hour. If desired, bring any remaining glaze to a boil in a saucepan and drizzle over chops to serve.

Description: 
I put this glaze on pork chops and stuff them with an apple cranberry stuffing. You can double it and make it a ham glaze also.
