Ingredients:
1 cup White Beech Mushroom
1 cup Brown Beech Mushroom
1 cup King Oyster Mushroom--cut into thin slices
1 cup oyster mushroom--tear into small pieces
1 cup shitake mushroom--cut into bite size pieces
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon corn starch--mix with 1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon white pepper powder
2 tablespoon red bell pepper--diced finely
2 tablespoon green onion--cut into thin slices

Directions:
Put a clay pot in the oven, and turn it to 375 degree. (Remember to put the clay pot in there first, so it will heat slowly and not crack)
Rinse all mushrooms and set aside to drain.
Heat up the vegetable oil in a wok until you can feel the heat above it, then put all the mushrooms in it. Keep stirring them until the volume is reduced (about 3 to 5 minutes). Then add the salt, and chicken stock. Turn up the stove until it boils, then turn off the stove.
Transfer the mushrooms to the clay pot.
Turn the oven to 300 degree, and bake the clay pot for 10 minutes.
Add the corn starch water to the clay pot, stir everything evenly, then cover and bake it in the 375 degree oven for another 10 minutes.
Add the white pepper powder, green onion and red bell pepper to the stew.
Return the clay pot to the 375 degree oven for another 5 minutes, then you are ready to serve.
