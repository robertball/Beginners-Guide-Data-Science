Directions:
Place lamb chops in a shallow baking dish or resealable. Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary, honey, mustard, oregano, salt and pepper and pour over chops. Toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat grill. Grill chops over a medium high heat for about 5 minutes per side on until browned to desired doneness. I like mine medium rare.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe tonight. I'm sure there is something similar out there. I don't really care for the sweet cherry or mint chops. ENJOY!
