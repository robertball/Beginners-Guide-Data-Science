Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs peeled and deveined shrimp
2 eggs, beaten with 1 TB water
1 cup flour
1 TBS paprika
1 tsp each salt and black pepper
1 tsp each dried oregano, thyme, marjoram, garlic powder and onion powder
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1 cup italian style bread crumbs
2 TBS parmesan cheese
1 32oz jar roasted red pepper and garlic tomato sauce
1 cup shredded mozarella cheese
2 cups canola oil

Directions:
Pour canola oil in pot to depth of about 3 inches and heat to 350 degrees.
Combine all spices and put 1 tbs in a small bowl with the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and mix the remaining spices in a bowl with the flour.
First flour the shrimp, then dip in the egg wash and then in the bread crumbs. Let sit on a plate while you bread all of the shrimp before you start cooking.
Fry all the shrimp until they start to float an are a nice golden brown. This will go very fast, about 1 minute. DO NOT OVERCOOK! Drain well and put on a papertowel lined plate to soak up any remaining oil.
After all the shrimp are cooked, pour the tomato sauce in an 8 x 8 casserole dish and top with the fried shrimp, dipping them to coat with the sauce. Top with the mozzarella cheese and broil for 3-4 minutes or until the cheese is starting to brown nicely.
