Description: 
The kids requested to have THE special pound cake for the long weekend. It is a recipe given to my mother from her friend in Australia. It is too delicious not to share it! I sometimes use egg substitute instead of eggs, and it turns out just as great. Pound cakes in the U.S. usually bakes in a Bundt cake pan, but this ones bakes in a loaf cake pan, comes out just like the ones from the market.
