Ingredients:
2-3 jalape√±o chiles
1 Thai chile, sliced
3-4 garlic cloves, unpeeled
1 15-ounce can fire roasted diced tomatoes in juice
1/2 cup (loosely packed) chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons fresh lime or lemon juice
Kosher salt to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can Mexican-style stewed tomatoes, drained, juices reserved
1/2 small red onion, roughly chopped
3 green onions, thinly sliced
2 medium plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped
2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon ground cumin
ground pepper to taste

Directions:
In a small ungreased skillet over medium heat, roast the chiles and garlic, turning regularly, until they are soft and blotchy brown, about 15 minutes.  Cool until handleable, then pull the stems off the chiles, remove seeds, and roughly chop.  Peel the skin off the garlic.  Scoop into a food processor and pulse until quite finely chopped.
Add tomatoes, green onion, and red onion. Re-cover and pulse until you have a coarse puree.  Scrape into a serving dish.
Stir in the cilantro, cumin, lime, and vinegar.  Taste and season with salt.  Add reserved stewed tomato juices until you achieve the desired consistency.
Refrigerate for at least a few hours before serving; gets better after a day or two in the fridge.
