12oz jar roasted red peppers and yellow peppers
1/4 cup mixed country olives
1/4 cup Italian parsley

Cook penne as package directs. While it is cooking, cut peppers into strips, pit olives, and chop parsley.
Swirl olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic. Cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
Add peppers and saute 1-2 minutes just to heat through. Before draining pasta, ladle off and reserve 1/4 cup cooking water.
Drain pasta, return to pot and add peppers, olives, parsley, capers and reserved water. Toss to mix and coat. Pour into a serving bowl and serve with shaved cheese.
