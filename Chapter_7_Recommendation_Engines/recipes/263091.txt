Ingredients:
1/2 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1/2 (8 ounce) container herbed cream cheese
7 ounces sliced smoked salmon
1 sprig fresh dill, finely chopped, or to taste

Directions:
Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll puff pastry and roll out to a rectangle. Spread a thin layer of herbed cream cheese over the puff pastry. Cover with smoked salmon slices and sprinkle with dill, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll puff pastry up tightly like a jelly roll and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Slice puff pastry roll into 1/4-inch-thick slices and lay on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until lightly browned and puffed up, 20 to 25 minutes.
