2 eggs
1/4 tsp. salt
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla

1/4 cup butter
3 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
3 Tablespoons milk/buttermilk

Grease a 9 x 13 inch baking pan; set aside. In a medium saucepan combine 1 cup butter, 1/3 cup cocoa and 1 cup water.  Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.  With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat chocolate mixture into the flour and salt until well blended. Add eggs, sour cream and vanilla. Beat one minute (batter will be thin).  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.  While cake is still warm, prepare frosting.
Frosting:  In small saucepan combine butter, cocoa, milk and vanilla.  Bring to a boil. Remove from heat, add powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth.  Using the round handle end of a wooden spoon, poke holes about 2 inches apart all across the cake. Pour warm frosting mixture over cake making sure the frosting goes into the holes.  Cool.
