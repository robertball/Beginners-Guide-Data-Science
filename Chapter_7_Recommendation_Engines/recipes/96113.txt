Ingredients:
1 (6 pound) 12-rib crown roast of pork
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup orange marmalade
1/2 cup pomegranate juice
2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger root
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the roast in a roasting pan; season with salt and pepper. Place roast in preheated oven.
In a small saucepan, combine pomegranate juice, ginger, lime juice, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer, stir in marmalade, and remove from heat. Set this glaze aside.
When the roast has been cooking for 1 hour and 20 minutes, brush roast with approximately 1/3 of the glaze. Roast 10 minutes more, brush with 1/3 more of the glaze.  Roast 10 minutes more, brush with remaining glaze. Continue roasting until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from oven, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Tender pork richly glazed with the sparkling taste of ginger and pomegranate juice. I recommend ginger marmalade if you can find it. Serve with apple sauce or gravy made from the juices in the pan.
