Ingredients:
3/4 cup of cold butter, I use stick butter and cut it into one inch pats.
2 1/2 cups of sugar.
2/3 cup of evaporated milk
12 oz chocolate chips.  I use 1/2 semi, 1/2 milk.
7 oz marshmallow creme
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Line a 9x9 pan with foil, extended up and over the sides.
In a large mixing bowl put the marshmallow creme, the chocolate chips and vanilla and any nuts.
In a heavy pan bring the milk and sugar to a boil, once the boil starts begin to add pats of butter, stirring slowly and do not scrape down the sides of the pot.  Once all butter is added allow the slurry to come to a SLOW rolling boil and continue to slowly stir. Do this for 8 mintues.
Turn heat off, and dump the slurry into the bowl of chips, etc....fold all together and incorporate until the color is uniform.  Put the fudge into your 9x9 pan and smooth the top out.  I allow mine to cool to room temp and then eitehr into the fridge or freezer, well covered and you can take it out of the pan.  Allow to come to room temp before you cut into squares.  This freezes well.

Description: 
I spent a long time trying to make the perfect fudge.  This recipe is a combo of a few I found and it makes fudge just the way we like it.  You can use any type of chip you want to mix up the flavors and, of course, add in nuts or whatever!
