Description: 
Our family makes these waffles for a gluten-free breakfast that tastes great, too! These waffles taste delicious with fruit inside them, too! Try substituting blueberries for chocolate chips; they're still delicious! Spread some butter, then add a dollop of maple syrup, and the kids will never know these aren't the regular pancakes you make every Saturday morning!
