Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 leek, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
8 kumquats, thinly sliced
salt to taste
1 cup quinoa
2 cups chicken stock

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir leek, garlic, and kumquats until brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt.
Cook and stir quinoa into kumquat mixture until quinoa is toasted, about 1 minute; add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa has absorbed the chicken stock, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This quinoa dish goes extremely well with fish. I bake the fish with kumquats as well. Try it with multi-colored quinoa.
