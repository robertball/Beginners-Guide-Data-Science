Ingredients:
2-1/2 to 3 pound chicken, cut up
1 large onion, chopped
3 Tablespoons butter
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 small can tomato sauce
2 cups boiling water
1 cup raw rice
pinch of sugar

Directions:
In a large pot or Dutch Oven, melt butter and brown chicken; remove chicken and set aside.  Add the chopped onion to the drippings and cook until golden and translucent.  Return the chicken to the pot and continue to brown with the onions.  Mix the tomato sauce with a little hot water and add to the chicken.  Add seasonings and simmer covered until the chicken is tender.  Add boiling water and rice and continue to cook for another 20 minutes or until rice is done.  (I like to remove the chicken when adding the rice and water and then combine the two later, before serving.)
