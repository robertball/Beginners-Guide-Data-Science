Ingredients:
1 russet potato
¾ cup imitation sour cream
1/3 cup olive oil
2 medium-large cloves roasted garlic*

1-1¼ teaspoons garlic salt
4-6 tablespoons unsweetened almond milk

Directions:
Peel and cut potato into 1? pieces. Place in a medium-size pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook potatoes for 15 minutes or until they are easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and rinse with cold water. Place in a deep bowl and blend with sour cream, olive oil, garlic, dill and garlic salt until thoroughly combined and creamy. Add almond milk 2 tablespoons at a time until desired consistency is reached, then beat for another minute or until light and fluffy.

Description: 
Before going vegan, I’d always enjoy this delicious dip called Patata served at one of the local Lebanese / Mediterranean restaurants. Unfortunately it wasn’t until recently that I found out they put sour cream in it. So, needless to say I veganized it so that I can enjoy it once again! Patata is delicious with pita bread, crackers and vegetables. It’s also tasty on greek-inspired sandwiches and wraps.
