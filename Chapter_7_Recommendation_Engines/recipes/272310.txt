Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury® Grands™ Juniors)
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package shredded pepper Jack cheese
1/4 cup drained pickled diced jalapenos, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Cut each biscuit into quarters and dip half into the melted butter. Place in the prepared pan. Top with 1/2 of the pepper Jack cheese, 2 tablespoons jalapenos, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. Dip the remaining biscuit pieces in butter and place in the pan; top with remaining cheese, jalapenos, and garlic powder.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge to loosen; remove from the pan. Serve warm.
