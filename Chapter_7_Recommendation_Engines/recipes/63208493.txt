Ingredients:
4 Avocados (skinned & pitted)
2 cloves of fresh garlic
1 tablespoon of lime juice
1/2 cup of red onion
2-4 habenero  peppers (depending on spiciness)
1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
4 sprigs of cilantro (more or less to taste)
1 half of a large tomato

Directions:
Combine all ingredients into a food processor except the tomato.  Ingriedients should go into the food processor chopped up (rough diced).   Process in the food processor until smooth and thoroughly blended you may have to scrape the sides a couple of times and re blend so it is not chunky, (unless that is how you like it!)  Take tomato and De-seed, then finely dice and mix into guacamole by hand...unless you want the entire guacamole to be smooth then mix in the tomatoes with the rest of the ingredients in the beginning.
