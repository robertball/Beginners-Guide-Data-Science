Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 strips maple-flavored bacon, chopped
1 large white onion, chopped
2 red pears - peeled, seeded, and chopped
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
3 cups Swanson® Chicken Broth
sour cream for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place squash in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the squash in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.
Roast squash in prepared oven for 20 minutes; turn. Continue roasting until softened, 10 to 20 minutes more.
Place the chopped bacon into a heavy pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve the bacon drippings.
Place the pot over medium heat; add the onion, pears, garlic, rosemary, and thyme and cook in the bacon drippings until onions and pears are soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the roasted squash and cook another 5 minutes. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chipotle pepper; simmer on medium-low until ingredients are very soft and flavors have combined, about 10 minutes.
Puree the soup in a blender or food processor in small batches.
Ladle soup into serving bowls and garnish with crumbled bacon and a generous dollop of sour cream. Enjoy!
