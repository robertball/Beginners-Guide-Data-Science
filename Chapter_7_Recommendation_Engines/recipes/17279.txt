Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 egg
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in egg, buttermilk and oil until mixture is smooth.
Pour the batter by spoonfuls into the hot pan, forming 5 inch circles. When the edges appear to harden, flip the pancakes. Cook on both sides until golden brown. Serve hot.

These are just like the ones you eat at a certain national pancake chain. They're simple but delicious. Buttermilk pancakes are definitely the best!
