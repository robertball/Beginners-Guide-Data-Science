Ingredients:
6 pork steaks (1//2 to 3/4 inch thick)
Olive oil
Salt
Greshly ground black pepper
Garlic powder
Chili powder
At least 1 (12-oz.) can beer
At least 1 (24-oz.) bottle barbecue sauce (Maull's prefered)

Directions:
Place pork steaks on tray. Rub generously on both sides with olive oil. Season each steak with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle liberally with equal amounts of garlic powder and chili powder to taste. If it looks like too much, it's probably right.
Brown pork steaks on grill (low heat) about 45 minutes, or until almost done. Tranfer to Dutch oven.
Combine beer and barbecue sauce; pour mixture over steaks. (Mixture should cover steaks. If more is needed, the ratio should still be 1 part beer to 2 parts barbecue sauce.) Place cover on Dutch oven; set on grill over very low heat. Cook approximately 1 hour, or until pork steaks are tender but not falling apart.
