Ingredients:
4 lbs pork ribs
3/4 c brown sugar
1 tsp hickory smoke salt
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp red pepper
2 c BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's)

Directions:
Peel off membrane from bony side of ribs.
Mix together sugar and spices to make rub, apply rub to all sides of ribs and return to fridge for 2 -24 hours.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Lay each rib slab, meaty side down, on two sheets of tin foil, shiny side out, and also cover with two sheets of foil, shiny side out. Crimp foil up tightly to avoid leakage as much as possible.
Place on baking sheet and cook for 2-2 1/2 hours or until tender. We've also cooked these at 250 degrees for 3-3 1/2 hours.
Remove from oven, remove from foil and place on grill (medium temp). Brush on BBQ sauce and cook a few minutes until sauce is cooked on and bubbly. Turn ribs over and repeat.
