Ingredients:
3 pounds ripe autumn-olives, rinsed and dried
1 cup water
2 pounds sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
In a large saucepan crush the berries very lightly with a wooden spoon or potato masher.
Add the water and bring to a simmer.
Cook, stirring, until berries are just soft enough to press in batches through a strainer or food mill to remove the seeds.
Return the pulp to a clean saucepan over medium heat.
Add the sugar, stirring to dissolve.
Keep at a simmer and skim off any foam that forms at the sides and in the middle.
Add the lemon juice.
When the jam reaches gel point* turn off the heat.
When fully cooled, pour into sterilized glass jars.
*Gel point test: Dip a large metal spoon sideways onto the jam. When two drops of liquid meet towards the middle, setting point has been reached.
