Ingredients:
6 cups chicken stock
1/4 cup butter
8 tablespoons all-purpose flour
12 ounces Brie cheese
3/8 cup white wine
2 ounces julienned carrots
1/4 cup chopped celery
2 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in sauce pan over low heat. Add flour and mix well, cooking until it just starts to turn golden.
Add stock and whip vigorously, bring to boil and reduce to simmer. Skim the butter and flour and other impurities that rise to the top and continue to simmer until the veloute is reduced to 2/3 its original quantity and the sauce is the consistency of heavy cream.
Strain through fine sieve.
Return veloute to sauce pan over low heat and add brie cheese, cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the cheese has melted. Add wine and vegetables and simmer lightly until the vegetables are al dente. Heat heavy cream over low heat and add to soup. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with fresh chives or scallion.

Description: 
The flavor of this soup can vary depending on the degree of ripeness of the brie cheese. If you put your brie cheese out at room temperature for 3 to 9 hours, this will intensify the brie flavor in your soup.
