Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Stir coconut milk, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan. Spoon a few tablespoons of the coconut milk mixture into a small bowl and stir cornstarch into the mixture to dissolve; pour into the mixture in the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring constantly; cook until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes.
Pour the coconut milk mixture into molds, cover each with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold and firm, 3 hours to 2 days.
Run a thin knife around the edges of the mold and invert onto a plate to remove putting. Garnish tops with cinnamon.
