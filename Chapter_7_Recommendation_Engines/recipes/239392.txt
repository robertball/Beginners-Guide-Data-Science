Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/2 onion, sliced, or to taste
3 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced
3 cloves garlic, peeled, or more to taste
1 head cauliflower, chopped
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock, or as needed
2 tablespoons yellow curry powder
1 tablespoon butter
4 dashes hot sauce (such as TapatioÂ®), or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrots, red bell pepper, and garlic until tender and softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cauliflower to vegetable mixture and pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Cook soup until cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes.
Remove pot from heat and blend soup using a hand blender until smooth.
Place pot over low heat and add curry powder, butter, hot sauce, salt, and pepper to soup; simmer until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
I found a really good basic cauliflower soup recipe and modified it. This soup is easy, healthy, and so good! It's really good with a little bit of butter or sour cream as a garnish.
