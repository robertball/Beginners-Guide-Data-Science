Ingredients:
3/4 cup dry brown lentils
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package gourmet mushroom blend, roughly chopped
1 cup matchstick-cut carrots, plus more for garnish
2 cloves garlic, minced, divided
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon peanut butter
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
1 tablespoon Thai red chile paste
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 teaspoon sesame oil
6 large Bibb lettuce leaves

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in lentils. Reduce heat; simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and spray with cooking spray. Add mushrooms, carrots, and 1 clove garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Whisk honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, peanut butter, sriracha sauce, chile paste, ginger, sesame seeds, and sesame oil together in a bowl until sauce is well blended.
Stir lentils and sauce into the mushroom mixture in the skillet until filling is combined and sauce is absorbed.
Arrange lettuce leaves on a plate. Place a spoonful of the filling in each leaf.
