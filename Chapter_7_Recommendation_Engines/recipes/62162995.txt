Ingredients:
4 Hard boiled egg
Hot Sauce of choice (we love Cholula)

Directions:
EGG BOILING:
PLACE eggs in saucepan large enough to hold them in single layer.
ADD cold water to cover eggs by 1 inch. HEAT over high heat just to boiling.
REMOVE from burner.
COVER pan.
LET EGGS STAND in hot water about 15 minutes for large eggs (12 minutes for medium eggs; 18 minutes for extra large).
DRAIN immediately and place them in cold water with ice cubes to quickly chill and stop the cooking process.
LET EGGS STAND in ice water for approximately 15 minutes.
EGG PREP:
To peel the hard-cooked eggs: Gently tap egg on countertop until shell is finely crackled all over.
Roll egg between hands to loosen shell.
Starting peeling at large end, holding egg under cold running water to help ease the shell off.
Then take a parring knife and gently crest the yolk ball exposing the top.
To loosen the yolk ball, gently roll the egg between the palm of your hands.
Then pour in the Hot Sauce, rolling the egg again in the palm of your hands to saturate the interior.
