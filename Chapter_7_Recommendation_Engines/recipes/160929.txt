Ingredients:
1 untreated cedar plank
2 1/2 pounds boneless salmon fillet
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/2 teaspoon lime zest
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
6 lemon wedges

Directions:
Soak the cedar plank in water for 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Place the cedar plank across the grate of the grill as it preheats.
Season the salmon fillet with salt and pepper, and place onto the hot cedar plank skin-side down. Close the lid on the grill, and whisk together the maple syrup, soy sauce, butter, lime juice, and lime zest. Baste the salmon with the glaze, and continue cooking until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes total. Serve the salmon garnished with chopped fresh chives and lemon wedges.

Description: 
A fabulous sweet and salty glaze is basted on salmon as it grills on cedar planks.  The quick and easy glaze can be used on chicken and pork as well.  Good quality, grade B, pure maple syrup makes all the difference.
