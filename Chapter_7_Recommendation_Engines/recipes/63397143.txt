Ingredients:
8 garlic cloves, minced
6 T. EVOO
24 oz. potatoes cut into wedges
3 T. cornstarch
1/2 T. coarse sea salt
1/2 T. black pepper
1/2 t. garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 440 degrees F
Combine garlic and onion in a large bowl, warming it until the garlic is fragrant.
Transfer 5 T. of the oil (leaving the garlic in the bowl) to the baking sheet, coating it well.
Add the potatoes to the bowl with the garlic mixture and toss to coat. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and microwave until the potatoes are translucent around the edges, 3-6 minutes, shaking the bowl to redistribute the potatoes.
Combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl; sprinkle over the hot potatoes and toss to coat.
Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheet and bake, turning once, until deep golden brown and crispy, about 40 minutes.
Serve with ketchup, mayo, ranch, or sour cream.
