24hr or More Tri-Tip Marinade (Minimum 6hrs) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 cup lemon juice (Prefer Fresh Squeezed)
1 cup soybean oil (I regularly use EVOO)
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup black pepper
1/2 cup garlic salt (recommended: Lawry's)
1/2 cup chopped garlic
1/2 cup chopped dried onions
2 (4-pound) tri-tips, trimmed

Directions:
To make the marinade, mix all of the ingredients except for the beef in a large mixing bowl. Place the trimmed and tenderized tri-tips in a plastic container and pour the marinade over. Let stand in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours.
Heat grill to medium temperature.
Place tri-tips on grill at a 45 degree angle to establish grill marks and cook about 35 minutes, or until cooked to desired doneness. Remove the tri-tips from the grill and let rest about 2 to 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with your favorite side dishes.

Description: 
Found this recipe and just had to add it to my Recipe box as a go to! Made two Tri-Tips with the first one marinade for about 4 to 5 hours and the other closer to 30 hours.  Night and day difference and will always allow for at least 1 to 2 days before using this marinade in the future.  Everyone loved both however with a consistent nod to the 30 hour marinade.
