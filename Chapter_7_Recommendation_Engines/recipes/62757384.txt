Ingredients:
1 c besan
1 c water
1 T ginger paste
2 hot green chilies, chopped
1/8 tsp ground red pepper
1 tsp cumin seed
1/2 tsp salt
2 T light sesame oil
oil for frying

Directions:
Whisk the besan into the water to make a smooth, lump-free batter.  (may also use a food processor or blender)
Add all other ingredients except the oil
Heat a nonstick fry pan over medium heat until very hot - lightly oil using a pastry brush - you want a light film of oil.
Immediately pour on about 1/4c of the batter.  Tilt the pan around to spread the thin batter out evenly (do it fast before it sets)
Cook until the bottom is browned, a couple of minutes.
Flip, pour a little oil around the edges and cook the other side for about 45 secs
Remove and serve immediately if possible, or keep warm in a pie plate in a very low oven
Serve with chutney, sambar, or rasam
