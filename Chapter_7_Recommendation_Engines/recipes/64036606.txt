Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 (16 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 onions, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1.5 tsp of Cumin

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Combine ground beef, kidney beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low for 10 hours, or High for 4 hours.
Garnish each serving with Cheddar cheese.
