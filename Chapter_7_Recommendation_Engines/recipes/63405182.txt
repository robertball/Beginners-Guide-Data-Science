Ingredients:
2 cubes butter
2 cubes Imperial margarine
2 cups sugar
2 cups raw whole almonds
2 cups finely chopped walnuts, divided
8-10 oz of grated good quality milk chocolate, divided

Directions:
Sprinkle half of the walnuts to cover the bottom of an 11x17 baking dish.  Sprinkle half of the grated milk chocolate over the walnuts and set aside.
In a large heavy pot, melt together the butter, margarine, sugar and almonds over medium heat.  Bring to a boil stirring constantly, and then boil and stir until the mixture reaches 315 on a candy thermometer (around 15 minutes).  Pour over the walnut/chocolate in the dish and spread quickly.  Sprinkle the remaining grated chocolate over and then sprinkle the remaining walnuts.  Shake to distribute evenly and allow to cool, then refrigerate overnight.  Break into pieces and serve!
