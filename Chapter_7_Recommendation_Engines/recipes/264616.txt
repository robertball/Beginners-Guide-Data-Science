Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds cubed beef stew meat
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons Hungarian paprika, or to taste
3 large carrots, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
9 mushrooms, quartered
1 clove garlic, pressed
1/3 cup ketchup
1 1/4 cups beef broth

Directions:
Combine beef, flour, and paprika in a plastic container with a lid. Close the lid and shake vigorously so meat is covered with flour and paprika.
Place meat on the bottom of the slow cooker. Add carrots, bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Pour ketchup and beef broth on top.
Cook on Low until meat is tender and cooked through, about 8 hours, stirring occasionally if possible.

Description: 
Goulash is perfect for the slow cooker - I usually prepare all the ingredients the night before and then throw everything in the slow cooker the next morning. Serve with pasta or rice.
