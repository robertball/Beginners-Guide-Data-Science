Directions:
Two  2-1/2 to 3 lbs. broiling chicken, halved
Rao’s Homemade Lemon Chicken Marinade
1/4 cup chopped parsley
To attain maximum heat, preheat broiler for at least 15 minutes before using. Broil chicken halves, turning once, for about 30 minutes or until skin is golden-brown and juices run clear when bird is pierced with a fork. Remove chicken from broiler, leaving broiler on. Using a very sharp knife, cut each half into 6 pieces (leg, thigh, wing, 3 small breast pieces). Place chicken on a baking sheet with sides, of a size that can fit into a broiler. Pour Rao’s Homemade Lemon Chicken Marinade over the chicken and toss to coat well. If necessary, divide sauce in half and do this in two batches. Return to broiler and broil for 3 minutes. Turn each piece and broil for an additional minute.
