Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons butter, divided
2 (12 inch) flour tortillas
6 ounces Brie cheese, rind removed and cheese thinly sliced
1 sweet-tart apple, such as Fugi or Gala, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Melt 3/4 teaspoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat, tilting the skillet to evenly spread butter. Place 1 tortilla in the melted butter. Cover tortilla with Brie cheese slices and apple slices; sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Place the remaining tortilla over the filling.
Cook quesadilla until bottom tortilla is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread the remaining 3/4 teaspoon butter on top tortilla; carefully flip quesadilla and cook until bottom tortilla is browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 more minutes. Slice quesadilla into quarters.
