Ingredients:
6 medium sweet potatoes
1 tsp coarse sea salt (I just used a few pinches of regular salt)
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp ancho chili powder (I just used regular chili powder)
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
3 cups cooked shredded pork (I used one of the vacuum-sealed bags from a package of Carnitas from Costco - prepared it first according to the package's directions)
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 cup frozen yellow corn
2 tbsp fresh lime juice (or 1 tsp TrueLime powder)
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese
Cilantro for garnish (optional)
Diced avocado for garnish (optional)
Lime juice for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Pierce each sweet potato 5x with a fork.  Bake for 60 minutes, or until soft.  Let cool so you can handle them.
Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out the insides into a bowl.  Leave a little bit of the potato around the skin, otherwise the skin will rip and fall apart.
Add the spices to the sweet potatoes and mix well.  Add pork, bell pepper, corn, and lime juice and mix well.
Scoop the sweet potato mixture back into the skins.  Bake for 15 minutes.
Remove from oven and sprinkle cheese on potatoes.  Bake for another 5-10 minutes, or until cheese is starting to brown and bubble.
Garnish with chopped cilantro, avocado, and lime juice.
