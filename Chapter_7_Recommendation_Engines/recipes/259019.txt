Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup white sugar
¾ cup butter
¼ cup orange juice
2 tablespoons grated orange zest
3 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuits (10 biscuits per can)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with 2 tablespoons butter.
Combine sugar, 3/4 cup butter, orange juice, and orange zest in a saucepan; warm over low heat until sugar is dissolved and butter is melted, about 5 minutes.
Separate biscuits; cut in half. Layer half in the bottom of the prepared tube pan. Pour half of the orange juice mixture over the biscuits. Repeat both steps.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
