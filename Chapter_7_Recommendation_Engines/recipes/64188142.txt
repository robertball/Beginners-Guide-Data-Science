2/3 cup chicken broth

1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup orange marmalade
1 head garlic

Directions:
In the bottom of slow cooker, add chicken broth, 4 orange quarters and onion.
In a small mixing bowl, stir together butter, chopped rosemary, salt, pepper and marmalade.
Salt and pepper the chicken and the cavity.  Place rosemary springs, garlic and remaining orange quarters inside the cavity.
Using your fingers, loosen the skin from the meat.  Place half of butter mixture underneath the skin.  Rub remaining butter mixture on the outside of the chicken.
Place chicken on top of orange quarters.  Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, or until juices run clear.
