Ingredients:
2 T. vegetable oil
4 pork chops (1/2" thick), trimmed
2 T. flour
1/2 t. seasoned salt (optional)
1/3 c. grated parmesan cheese
1/2 t. salt
1/4 t. pepper
1 bag Yukon Gold mini potatoes, halved
2 medium onion, sliced thin
4 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, sauteed in butter (optional)
3 cubes beef bouillon (I used beef base concentrate)
3/4 c. hot water
1 T. lemon juice

Directions:
Heat oil in electric skillet.
Coat chops in flour & seasoned salt.
Brown chops about 4 minutes on each side.
In a small bowl, combine parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.
Sprinkle about half of the cheese mixture over the chops.
Layer chops with potato halves, sauteed mushrooms, and sliced onions.  Top with remaining cheese topping.
Dissolve the beef bouillon cubes or concentrated base in water.  Add lemon juice.
Pour over the chops and vegetables.
Cover skillet, and reduce heat.  Simmer 40 minutes, until potatoes are tender and chops have reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees.
