Ingredients:
Ingredients:?
1/3 cup reduced-fat buttermilk?
1/8 tsp. paprika
12 oz. raw boneless skinless lean chicken breast tenders (about 10 pieces)?
1/3 cup Fiber One bran cereal (original)?
1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs (like the kind by Progresso)?
1 tbsp. dry onion soup mix
Optional: salt, to taste

Directions:
Directions:
In a large sealable container or plastic bag, combine buttermilk with paprika and mix well. Add chicken and coat completely. Seal and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Prepare a large baking sheet by spraying it with nonstick spray. Set aside.
Using a blender or food processor, grind Fiber One cereal to a breadcrumb-like consistency. Pour crumbs into a large bowl. Add panko breadcrumbs and onion soup mix. If you like, add a dash or two of salt. Mix thoroughly.
One at a time, remove each piece of chicken from container/bag, give it a shake (to get rid of excess buttermilk), coat it evenly with the crumb mixture, and lay it flat on the baking sheet.
Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Flip carefully (tongs work well!), and then bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until outsides are crispy and chicken is cooked through. CRUNCH time!

Description: 
Fried chicken is a true country classic, and buttermilk fried chicken's even better. Either way, it's far too fatty for us. But good news! We've made it over using lean chicken, lightened-up buttermilk, and our signature faux-fry method with some extra-special additions.
