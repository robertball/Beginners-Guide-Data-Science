Ingredients:
1/4 C. raw cashews (soaked in water for several hours and then drained IF you don’t have a high powered blender)
1 C. hot water
2  T. + 1 t. tapioca starch
1 T. extra virgin olive oil (optional)
1 small garlic clove, minced
3/4  t. sea salt
1 t. fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Blend all ingredients together in a high speed blender until completely smooth, about 1 minute.
Pour into a small saucepan and cook, stirring constantly over medium high heat. After a couple of minutes the mixture will start to look weird, like it’s curdling or separating. This is totally normal, reduce heat to medium and KEEP stirring so you don’t burn the cheese to the bottom of the pot. Keep cooking and stirring til really thick (about 2-3 more minutes) and the mixture becomes like a cohesive mass of melted dairy cheese and stretches.
Remove from heat and let cool a bit while you assemble the pizzas.
