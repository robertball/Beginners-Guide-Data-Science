Ingredients:
4 oz. goat cheese
1 tbsp. chives, chopped
2 tsp. lemon juice
pepper to taste
flour for dusting
1 sheet puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
Mash the goat cheese with the chives, lemon, and pepper.
Flour your surface.
Unfold the pastry sheet and dust a bit more flour on.
Cut the dough into 9 squares.
Put equal amounts of goat cheese mix on each square.
Dip your finger in water and wet the edges of each square.
Fold the pastry over to form a triangle.
Press the edges closed with a fork.
Arrange the turnovers on a lightly greased baking sheet (I use Pam).
Bake at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes until puffed and golden.

Description: 
These turnovers combine a devine flavor combination.  They look tough to put together, but they are really not. Assemble them a few hours ahead of time then refrigerate. When the girls come over for book club, pop them in and watch them get devoured. I ate five of them for dinner last night.
