Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup milk
food coloring
chocolate sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 4 in mini cake pans.
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder, add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Finally stir in the milk until batter is smooth. Pour or spoon batter into the prepared pans. Add 2-4 drops food coloring and swirl through cake, but do not mix thoroughly.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cake is done when it springs back to the touch.
Cut cake in half and add generous amount of chocolate sauce to bottom half then replace with top half and frost with your children's favorite topping.

Description: 
This cake is very simple. I love to make it for my kids, mini size, and with a secret color surprise. They love to guess what color is inside. I frost chocolate to make it a little more fun.Modified from: Simple White Cake
