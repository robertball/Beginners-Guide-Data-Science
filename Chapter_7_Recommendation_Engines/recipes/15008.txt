Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
3/4 cup vegetable oil
5 eggs
2 tablespoons anise seed
6 tablespoons anise extract
1 cup chopped almonds
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix, oil, eggs, anise seeds, almonds, and anise extract. Mix well after each addition. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick comes out clean.
Cut down the middle of the pan, then cut each half into 1/2 inch slices. Place slices on their side onto the jellyroll pan and return to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until toasted. Cool and dust with confectioners' sugar.
