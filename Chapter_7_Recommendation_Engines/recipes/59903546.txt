Shape into 40 balls and place each into an ungreased mini muffin pan.  If you do not have mini muffin pans place balls on baking sheets

Description: 
For the recipe I swapped out the butter for shortening, and reduced the sugar, brown sugar, and flour.  Now  days they seem to make the mini peanut butter cups in seasonal wrappers for every holiday, pick up a bag or two after the holiday is over when they are discounted and throw a bag in the freezer.  Use store brand or sale priced baking goods as well for extra savings.Modified from: Peanut Butter Cup Cookies
