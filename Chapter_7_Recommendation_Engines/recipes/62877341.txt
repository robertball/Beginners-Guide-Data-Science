Ingredients:
1 pint of shucked oysters
1 box of cracker meal (Dixie Lily brand here)
salt to taste
Crisco for frying

Directions:
Pour oysters into a strainer over the sink or a bowl to drain
While oysters are draining, place cast iron skillet over medium heat and add enough Crisco to be 1/2" deep when melted.
When oysters have drained, salt liberally or to taste
When oil is hot (~350Â°F), roll each oyster in cracker meal and add to frying pan.
Cook oysters until golden brown on first side and then turn and brown second side.  Don't try to put too many in the pan at once!
Remove with slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate.  Serve immediately while warm.
