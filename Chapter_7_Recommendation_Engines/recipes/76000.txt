Ingredients:
peanut or corn oil for frying
3/4 cup self-rising flour
1/2 cup self-rising cornmeal mix
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 egg
1/2 cup buttermilk
cinnamon (optional)
sugar (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal mix, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat the egg together with the buttermilk. Gradually add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a fork or whisk until only slightly lumpy. Be careful not to overmix.
Carefully drop batter by the rounded teaspoonful into hot oil, and fry until golden brown. Drain and cool on a paper towel-lined plate. Roll balls in a small amount of cinnamon mixed with sugar, if desired, or just enjoy plain!

Description: 
These are my rendition of a sweet hush puppy. They are quick and easy to make and are great for breakfast or with coffee. I like them plain, but they are yummy rolled in cinnamon and sugar, too.
