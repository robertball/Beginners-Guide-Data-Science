Ingredients:
Non-stick cooking spray
1 12oz can evaporated milk
2.5 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup peanut butter
Optional:  1 cup white chocolate chips and any flavor extract of your choice.

Directions:
Spray 9 inch pan or casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray.  In large, heavy-bottomed pot, stir evaporated milk and sugar until evenly mixed.  Boil over medium-high heat on stovetop for approximately 5-7 minutes, stirring constantly.  Test with candy thermometer until mixture reaches 234 degrees Farenheit, or "soft-ball" forms when a teaspoon of mixture is dropped into a bowl filled with cold water. Remove pot from heat.  Quickly add butter, vanilla, and peanut butter.  Stir mixture well; it may "set up" quickly, making mixing difficult.  Pour fudge mixture into prepared pan, and let cool to cut.  To make other flavors, replace peanut butter with white chocolate chips and any flavor extract of your choice.
