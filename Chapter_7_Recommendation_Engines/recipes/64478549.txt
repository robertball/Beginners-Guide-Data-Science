Best Easy Breakfast Potatoes Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
4 Yukon Gold Potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes or pieces.
3 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup steak seasoning

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 500 degrees.
Line two baking sheets with foil.
Put the potatoes in a large bowl. Add the oil and steak seasoning and toss. Each potato bit should have a thin coat of oil and be well-seasoned. Add more oil/seasoning as necessary.
Place the potatoes on the baking sheets with tongs, leaving room between each piece (this will help them cook faster and crisp up).
Place baking sheets in oven.
After 5 minutes, remove sheets from oven, close oven door, and toss potatoes.
After 5 more minutes, remove sheets from oven and test for doneness (a sharp knife will slide in and out of the potato with minimal resistance). If not done, toss and return to oven for a few more minutes.
