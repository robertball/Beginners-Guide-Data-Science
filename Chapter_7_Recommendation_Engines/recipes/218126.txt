Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 bone-in chicken breast halves with skin
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Rub olive oil over each chicken breast, then season both sides with salt and black pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down on a broiling pan.
Broil in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then flip the chicken breast skin-side up. Continue broiling the chicken until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes more.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and allow meat to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
