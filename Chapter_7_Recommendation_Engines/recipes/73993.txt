Ingredients:
6 medium red potatoes, cubed
½ cup butter, melted and divided
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 ½ cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
½ cup salsa
1  lime, cut into wedges (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).  Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil.
Toss potatoes with about 1 tablespoon of melted butter until coated. Arrange in a single layer in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove pan from oven, and push potatoes out to the sides of the dish. Place the chicken breast halves in the dish. Stir together the remaining butter and lime juice. Brush onto chicken. Return to the oven.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear. In a small bowl, toss together the cheese, cilantro and salsa. Sprinkle over the chicken and potatoes. Return to the oven for a few minutes, until the cheese is melted. Serve with lime wedges.
