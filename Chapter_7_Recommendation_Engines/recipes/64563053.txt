Ingredients:
3 lbs potatoes
1/2 C butter
1/4 C sour cream
1/4 C half-and-half
2 tsp salt, or to taste
1 tsp black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Peel potatoes and roughly chop into chunks of similar size.  Bring a large pot with enough water to cover the potatoes to a rolling boil and carefully add the potatoes to the water.  Allow to boil for 15-20 minutes or until potato chunks can easily be mashed with a fork.
Drain potatoes and transfer hot potatoes to a large bowl.  Add butter to bowl and use potato masher to mash into potatoes as it melts.  Add sour cream, half and half, salt, and pepper and continue to mash to desired consistency.
