Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups grated zucchini
1 1/2 over-ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup applesauce
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine zucchini, bananas, applesauce, brown sugar, oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, baking soda, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, salt, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to zucchini mixture while continuously stirring until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups about 3/4-full.
Mix white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
