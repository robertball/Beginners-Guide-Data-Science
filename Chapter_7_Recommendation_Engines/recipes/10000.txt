Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups milk
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine flour, white sugar, cocoa powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and baking powder.  Stir in 1 1/2 cups milk, eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and shortening. Mix until smooth using an electric mixer. Drop batter by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Leave space, and only use a teaspoon; these spread.
Bake in preheated oven for 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from pan immediately, and cool on wire rack.
To make the filling, combine the butter, confectioners' sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, marshmallow creme, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and 1 tablespoon milk in a medium bowl. Beat with mixer until fluffy. Spread filling on one cookie, and top with another sandwich style.

Description: 
Excellent frozen. I have played with this over the years, and come up with several variations. At the holidays, I have added 1 teaspoon peppermint extract to the filling in lieu of the vanilla, and have also used crushed peppermint candy in the filling. I have also dipped them in chocolate, and coated them in confectioners' sugar.
