Ingredients:
1 - 1.5 lb ground beef1 pkg (16 oz) Spaghetti noodles1 Tbsp Olive Oil1 Medium onion, or 1/2 large onion diced2 (14 oz) jars spaghetti sauce, or 3.5 cups of your favorite sauce1/2 cup Ricotta cheese4 Tbsp fresh Parsley - minced or 4 tsp dried flakes3 eggs3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese1 cups mozzerella cheese1 can (2.25 oz) sliced black olives1 tsp salt1/4 tsp ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.Grease a 10 inch springform pan or similar sized pie pan, or 9x13x3 inch cake pan and set aside.In a large skillet brown the beef.  Add the onions for the last 2 or 3 minutes so they become translucent.  Drain the beef and onion mixture.While beef and onions are cooking, boil water in a large pot, add the olive oil to the water to help keep the noodles from sticking together.  Boil the noodles for half the recommended time, do not fully cook or they will be overcooked in the oven.  Drain the noodles.In a large mixing bowl mix together the ricotta cheese, 2 cups spaghetti sauce, olives, eggs,  1/2 of the parsley, 1/2 cup parmesan, salt, and peper.  Add the beef and onion mixture and stir it in thoroughly.  Add the cooked spaghetti noodles and toss so they're evenly coated and mixed in the sauce.Pour the spaghetti mix into the pie or cake pan.  Top with the mozzerella cheese, remaining parmesan and remaining parsley.Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until the cheese starts bubbling and turns golden brown.  Heat the remaining sauce to use with breadsticks or similar side.
