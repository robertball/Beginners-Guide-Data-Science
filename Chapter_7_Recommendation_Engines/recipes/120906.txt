Ingredients:
1 medium onion, cut into chunks
2 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup water
2 pounds beef sirloin tip roast, cut into 1/4 inch thick slices
CUCUMBER SAUCE:
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks
4 garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cider vinegar
1/3 cup olive or vegetable oil
2 cups sour cream
8 pita breads, warmed and halved
thinly sliced onion
Chopped tomato

Directions:
In a blender or food processor, place the onion, garlic, sugar, mustard, ginger, pepper and cayenne; cover and process until onion is finely chopped. Add soy sauce and water; process until blended. Place the beef in a large resealable plastic bag. Add marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 1-2 hours.
For sauce, combine the cucumber, garlic and salt in a blender or food processor; cover and process until cucumber is chopped. Add vinegar and oil; process until blended. Transfer to a boil; stir in sour cream. Refrigerate until serving.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill beef, covered, over medium-hot heat until meat reaches desired doneness. Place beef in pita halves. Top with cucumber sauce, sliced onion and chopped tomato. Refrigerate any remaining sauce.

Description: 
A spicy marinade adds zip to these grilled beef slices tucked inside pita bread. Friends from Greece gave us their recipe for the cucumber sauce, which provides a cool contrast to the hot beef. I never have to worry about leftovers when I serve these sandwiches.                                                              --Lee Rademaker                                                              Hayfork, California
