Ingredients:
3 pounds potatoes, peeled
butter-flavored cooking spray
1/4 cup butter, or more if needed
1/4 cup milk, or more as needed
salt and pepper to taste
4 ounces sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/4 pound bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Place peeled potatoes in a large pot of water and bring to a boil. Boil until fork tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 3-quart casserole dish with butter spray.
Mash cooked potatoes using a potato masher in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup milk, salt, and pepper to taste. Depending on consistency, add more butter or milk. Stir in sour cream and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese; mix well. Transfer mixture to prepared casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Top with remaining Cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, and chives. Bake until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.
