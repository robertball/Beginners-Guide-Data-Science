Ingredients:
1 ½ cups plain fat-free yogurt
⅔ cup sweetened coconut flakes
⅔ cup panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)
½ cup finely chopped pecans
1 ½ pounds chicken breast, cut in 1-inch wide strips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Put yogurt in a small bowl, and set aside.  In a shallow pie plate, combine coconut, panko and pecans.
Dip chicken strips in yogurt to cover, then roll in panko mixture.  Place strips on an oil-sprayed baking sheet.  Spray top of chicken.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350, and bake 15 more minutes.  Check that coating browns but does not burn.  If desired, broil 2 minutes for an even crunchier top.
