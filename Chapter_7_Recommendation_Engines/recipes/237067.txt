Ingredients:
3 tablespoons salted butter
1 large sweet onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
4 cups chopped yellow potatoes
1 cup whole milk
1 cup half-and-half
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons curry powder
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 1/2 cups frozen peas
1 sheet frozen puff pastry

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir sweet onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in hot butter until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.
Stir carrots into the onion mixture; continue cooking and stirring until the carrot is slightly softened, about 5 minutes more. Add potatoes; stir.
Mix milk, half-and-half, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, coriander, cumin, curry powder, garam masala, and ginger together in a bowl until the spices are dissolved into the liquid; pour over the vegetable mixture in the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil. Stir peas into the boiling mixture; cook until peas are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour contents of pot into a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Cut frozen puff pasty lengthwise into 3 even pieces; arrange atop the vegetable mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until the pastry is puffed and golden brown and the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.
