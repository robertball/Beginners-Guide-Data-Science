Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 cup diced yellow onions
2/3 cup flour
6 cups hot chicken stock
4 cups diced, peeled baked potatoes
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon red pepper sauce
1 1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup diced green onions, white part only
additional chopped bacon
grated cheese for garnish
chopped parsley for garnish

Directions:
Fry bacon until crisp. Chop bacon and reserve drippings. Cook onions in remaining drippings over medium-high heat until transparent, about 3 minutes. Add flour, stirring to prevent lumps. Cook 3 - 5 minutes until mix just begins to run golden. Add chicken stock gradually, whisking to prevent lumps, until liquid thickens. Reduce heat to simmer and add potatoes, cream, chopped bacon, parsley, garlic, basil, salt, pepper sauce and black pepper. Simmer 10 minutes; DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL. Add grated cheese and green onions.
Heat until cheese melts smoothly. Garnish each serving as desired with chopped bacon, grated cheese and chopped parsley.
