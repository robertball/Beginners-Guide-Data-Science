Ingredients:
1/2 cauliflower
1 egg
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/8 tsp. black pepper
1/8 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. yellow onion, minced
1 tsp. coconut oil

Directions:
Grate the cauliflower head on a cheese grater to create cauliflower shreds or â€œrice."
Combine the shredded cauliflower with minced onion, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and stir to combine.
Heat 1 tsp. coconut oil over medium-high heat.
Add half the cauliflower mixture to the pan and gently press down with a spatula to flatten, working to keep the hash brown together as much as possible.
Cook for 1 minute after the edges start to turn golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.
Carefully flip over and cook an additional 3-4 minutes to let the edges brown and the cauliflower and onion cook through.
