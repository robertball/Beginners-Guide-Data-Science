Ingredients:
6 boneless, chicken breast halves, cut into 1" pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
2 T butter, melted
6 fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup carrots, cut into 1/2" dice
1/2 cup frozen green peas, defrosted
1/4 cup frozen corn, defrosted
1 stalk celery, diced
1 cup chicken broth
1/3 C white wine
1/4 t each - parsley, chives, dry mustard, garlic powder, chervil leaves, white pepper and freshly ground black pepper
1 T Worcestershire Sauce
1 Bay Leaf
1 T plus 1 t cornstarch
2 T water
1 (10 3/4 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1/2 C sour cream
2 ounces shredded Swiss Cheese
2 ounces shredded Cheddar Cheese
2 T grated Parmesan Cheese
Purchased pastry for double-crust Pie (I use Pillsbury)

Directions:
Saute chicken and onion in butter in a large skillet for 5 minutes.  Add sliced mushrooms and following ingredients, up to and including the bay leaf.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.
Let pie sit 10 minutes before serving.
Combine cornstarch with water in small bowl.  Stir into chicken mixture and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture comes to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in soup, sour cream and cheeses.
Place prepared pastry crust into a 2 1/2 quart shallow casserole.  Pour in chicken filling and top with remaining prepared pastry crust.  Trim edges of pastry and seal.  Pierce crust with fork in several places.
Bake at 400 for 30 to 40 minutes, or until lightly browned.
