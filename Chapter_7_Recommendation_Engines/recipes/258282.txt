Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package squid ink linguine
2 cups white wine
1 leek, chopped
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 green onions, chopped
1 shallot, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
6 large fresh scallops, or more to taste
12 New Zealand green-lipped mussels, cleaned
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 lemon, sliced, divided
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 baguette, sliced and toasted

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Combine white wine, leek, butter, green onions, shallot, and garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until leek and shallot soften, 2 to 4 minutes.
Stir scallops, mussels, salt, and pepper into the pot. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallops are opaque and mussels open, 2 to 4 minutes. Squeeze in juice from 2 lemon slices. Remove from heat; stir in heavy cream.
Divide linguine between serving bowls. Scoop scallop and mussels on top. Serve with remaining lemon slices and toasted baguette.

Description: 
This is an easy and very flavorful recipe using white wine, scallops, mussels, and lemon. Great for an appetizer without the pasta or meal with it. Made it for the first time and we practically licked the pot clean! Goes great with a good white wine.
