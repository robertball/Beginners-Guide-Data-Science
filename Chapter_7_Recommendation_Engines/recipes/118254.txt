Description: 
Tami Christman of Soda Springs, Idaho needs just four common pantry staples to put together this versatile mix. 'I use it in recipes that call for store-bought baking mix,' she says. It's the key to the lightly browned biscuits as well as to the chunky dumpling soup in the recipes that follow.
