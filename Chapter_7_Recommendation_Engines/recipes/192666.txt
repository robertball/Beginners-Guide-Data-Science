1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced thin

1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 pinch brown sugar (optional)

Directions:
Melt the butter with the olive oil in a shallow skillet over medium heat; cook the onion in the butter and oil until translucent. Season with salt, pepper, basil, paprika, tarragon, and brown sugar. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until the onions have softened and caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
