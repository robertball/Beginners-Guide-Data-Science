Ingredients:
1 tsp Garlic Powder
1/4 tsp Ground Mustard
1/2 tsp Hot Sauce (I prefer Cholula Original Hot Sauce)
1 tsp Worcestershire Sauce
1 Tbsp Steak Sauce
1 1/8 cups of Shredded Swiss Cheese
1 1/8 cups of Shredded White Extra-Sharp Cheddar Cheese
2 Tbsp Fresh Parmesan cheese (shredded or grated)
1 1/2 Tbsp Corn Starch
1/2 bottle of Guinness Beer (5 1/2 ozs.)
Fresh ground Pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Mix the shredded cheeses and cornstarch in a bowl and set aside.
Combine garlic powder, Ground mustard, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, and Guinness Beer in the fondue pot.
Heat the mixture over medium heat and add the cheese mixture (about a 1/2 cup at a time) until melted at desired thickness and all used (try not to boil).
Add ground fresh ground pepper to taste.
Serve with bread (we like Rye and assorted crusty breads), veggies and meats of all kinds(we like green peppers, grape tomatoes, carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, celery, ham, and salami).
Enjoy
