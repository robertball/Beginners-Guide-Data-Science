Ingredients:
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce
1 cup stir-fry sauce
8 (6 ounce) fillets whitefish
2 cups dry potato flakes
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons seasoning salt
2 tablespoons ancho chile seasoning
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 quart oil for frying

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the teriyaki sauce and stir-fry sauce. Place the whitefish fillets in the mixture, and marinate for about 15 minutes.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
In a shallow bowl, mix the dry potato flakes, flour, seasoning salt, ancho chile seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place each marinated fish fillet into the mixture to evenly coat.
Fry the fish in the heated oil, 1 or 2 fillets at a time, until golden brown and easily flaked with a fork, about 5 minutes.
