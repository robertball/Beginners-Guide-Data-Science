Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup flaxseed meal
1/3 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1/3 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 bananas, mashed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix whole wheat flour, brown sugar, flaxseed meal, oats, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
Combine eggs, butter, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter milk, and vanilla extract in another bowl. Stir in flour mixture. Add bananas; mix until batter is well-combined. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool, about 25 minutes.
