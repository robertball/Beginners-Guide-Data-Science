Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1/3 cup white sugar
Filling:
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened to room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs
Topping:
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/3 cup white sugar, or more to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch, or more to taste
1/2 cup cold water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl. Press crust mixture into the bottom of a pie plate.
Whip together cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar in a large bowl. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Spread filling over crust in the pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is almost set and slightly jiggly, about 45 minutes. Allow cheesecake to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Combine blueberries and 1/3 cup sugar in a saucepan over low heat. Stir cornstarch and cold water together in a small bowl until dissolved. Stir cornstarch mixture into blueberries in the saucepan. Bring to a low boil, about 5 minutes and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Pour blueberry topping over cheesecake before serving.
