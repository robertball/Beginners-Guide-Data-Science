Ingredients:
SCONES:
1 1/3C flour
1/2tsp baking soda
1/4tsp baking powder
1/4tsp salt
1TBSP sugar
1/2 stick butter
2 1/2 TBSP orange zest
1 1/2TBSP vinegar
6TBSP orange juice
1 medium egg, beaten
a SPLASH of milk
additional sugar
GLAZE:
1/2C + 2TBSP confectioners sugar
4tsp orange juice
1TBSP orange zest

Directions:
Heat oven to 425
SCONES:
Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and sugar together.
Cube butter and cut into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter, add orange zest.
Make a well in the flour mixture and combine vinegar and orange juice and beaten egg at once.
Stir mixture until all dry ingredients are moistened.
Turn onto a floured surface (dough will be sticky) and knead gently about 10 times.
Pat dough into about a 6x8 rectangle.
Cut dough into 4 squares then cut each square diagonally into 8 triangles.
Brush tops of scones with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar.
Bake at 425 on a greased cookie sheet (I put aluminum foil on a cookie sheet and spray that so I have less dishes).
Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown
GLAZE:
While scones are baking mix the confectioners sugar and orange juice until smooth.  Once you have the correct consistency (should be able to coat the back of a spoon and drip slowly) add the orange zest and mix.
Once the scones are done baking you can either drizzle the glaze on the scones or I actually hold the scones upside down and dunk them into the glaze so the tops are fully coated.  Let sit for 5 minutes then enjoy!

Description: 
Found this recipe online and tweaked it a little to make it more orangey as that was the ONLY complaint I got from the original recipe.  VERY EASY!!
