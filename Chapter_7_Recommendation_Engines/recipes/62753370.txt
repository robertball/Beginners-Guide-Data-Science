Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
¾ tsp baking soda
½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp kosher salt
1 cup sugar
½ cup canola oil
2 large eggs
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
½ cup buttermilk
3 medium bananas, mashed
½ cup walnuts, finely chopped/minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. In a small bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
In a medium bowl, beat together the sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla until well combined. Alternately add the dry ingredients and buttermilk in three additions. Gently stir in bananas and nuts.
Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Bake for 45-55 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the bread cool in a pan for 5 minutes. Carefully turn out the loaf to finish cooling on a wire rack.
