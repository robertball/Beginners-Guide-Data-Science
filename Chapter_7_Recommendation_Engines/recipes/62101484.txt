Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 tablespoons of oil or melted butter
Approx. 1 1/3rd cup of skim or 1% Milk
1 cup of all purpose flour (do not use cake flour!)
1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt
Topping:(optional)
cinnamon
icing sugar
maple syrup/honey
Jam

Directions:
Mix it all well by hand or with a mixer.
Put butter or oil in medium skillet.
Turn it to MEDIUM and pour about 1/2 a cup of batter in the middle of the pan.
The batter should be runny, so immediately you can turn the skillet so it runs to the sides. It takes no more than about 25 seconds before you turn the crepe to the other side. This side takes even less time.
Voila.... You have your Dutch pancake! Add a little sugar, honey or jam.
