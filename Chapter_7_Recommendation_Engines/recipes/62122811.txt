Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless beef or pork ribs
1 cup BBQ sauce
1/3 cup beef stock
Salt and Pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat.
Add ribs. Sprinkle salt and pepper over ribs. Cook ribs until all sides are light brown, but raw in the center (about 3-5 minutes.)
Once ribs are done, place them in a crockpot on high heat. Take the pan that you cooked the ribs in, and pour in the beef stock to deglaze. Pour the beef stock over ribs in slow cooker.
Pour bbq sauce over ribs, and let cook in the crockpot for about 3 hours, until they fall apart.

Description: 
Ribs that are first seared in a pan, then slow cooked in a crockpot. After they thoroughly cook, they fall apart. Also, you can make this recipe with other kinds of beef too (like stew meat peices.) They are truly delicious!!
