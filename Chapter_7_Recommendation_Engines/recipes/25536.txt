1 quart oil for deep frying
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained and flaked

1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoons water chestnuts, drained and chopped

Directions:
In a large, heavy sauce pan heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, crabmeat, garlic powder, paprika and water chestnuts.
Place approximately 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the center of wonton wrappers. Moisten wrapper edges with water, fold over the mixture and pinch to seal.
