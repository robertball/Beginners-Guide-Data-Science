Ingredients:
8 ounces crabmeat
4 ounces uncooked linguine pasta
2 eggs, beaten
3 green onions, finely chopped
1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lime zest
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in boiling water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and cut into 1 inch pieces.
In a mixing bowl, combine crab, noodles, eggs, green onion, bread crumbs, cilantro, olive oil and salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.
On wax paper, divide mixture into 6 equal piles; form each pile into a patty. Make sure noodles are incorporated and are not sticking out.
In a medium skillet, heat vegetable oil and cook patties over medium heat for 3 minutes on each side until golden. Drain on paper towels. Serve with cilantro-lime mayonnaise.
For the cilantro-lime mayonnaise, mix mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon cilantro, lime zest and lime juice in a small mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly. Chill until ready to serve.
