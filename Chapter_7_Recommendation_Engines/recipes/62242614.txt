Ingredients:
* water
* 1 package Trader Joe's Chopped Harvest Medley (butternut squash, yams, turnips...)
* 1 package Trader Joe's fresh sliced bell peppers
* 1 large red onion, chopped
* 3 heirloom tomatoes, chopped
* 1 bay leaf
* olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary
* 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/8 teaspoon onion salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon coriander
* 2 teaspoons dried parsley
* 1 (15 ounce) can black-eyed peas
* salt and cracked black pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour the Harvest Medley into a dutch oven and add enough water to cover.  Turn the burner on high.
Add the rest of the veggies and the bay leaf (not the black-eyed peas or the garlic), and boil until soft, about 20-25 minutes.
In the mean time, heat oil in a pan and add the spices, including the fresh garlic.  Cook for a couple of minutes, then stir in the black-eyed peas.  Heat through.
Pour the contents of the dutch oven into a food processor and blend until smooth, or to desired consistency.
Return the veggie blend to the dutch oven.  Stir in the black-eyed peas mixture.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve hot.

Description: 
A smooth and hearty vegan soup with full flavor.  Recipe adapted from Sweet and Spicy Soup with Black Eyed Peas and Sweet Potato.  (It is easier to make, and not as hot- so my toddler could help make it, and enjoy eating it too.)  Serves 4 hungry adults.
