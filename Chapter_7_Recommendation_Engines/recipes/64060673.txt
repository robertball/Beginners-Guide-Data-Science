Ingredients:
1 box of fudge cake mix
1 package of oreo cookies
1 package of chocolate pudding
24 cupcake liners
Frosting
cookies coarsely chopped
can of cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix packaged cake mix according to directions plus add package of chocolate pudding(do not bake). Line cupcake tins with liner, place a regular size Oreo cookie in the bottom of each liner. Take 1/2 of remaining cookies and chop coarsely and add to cake mix. Fill the cupcake tins. Bake for 15 minutes (or according to box directions).
Chop remaining regular-sized Oreos very fine (I put the cookies in the food processor instead of trying to chop them up super fine and it worked out really well). Add to frosting. After cupcakes have cooled frost.
