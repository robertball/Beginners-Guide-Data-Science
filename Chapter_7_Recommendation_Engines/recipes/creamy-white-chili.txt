Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (15.5 ounce) cans great Northern beans, rinsed and drained

2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup sour cream
½ cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, onion, and garlic into the hot oil until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix Great Northern beans, chicken broth, green chiles, salt, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into chicken mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 30 minutes.
Remove chili from heat; stir in sour cream and whipping cream until incorporated.
