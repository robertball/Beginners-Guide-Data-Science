Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) beef tenderloin steaks, about 1 1/2-inch thick
Goya Adobo with Pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season beef with adobo on both sides. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks to pan and cook until well browned and medium rare, flipping once, about 6 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate; cover with foil to keep warm.
Lower heat to medium. Add garlic to skillet and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add parsley and cook 30 seconds more.
Divide steaks evenly among serving dishes. Top steaks evenly with garlic mixture.
