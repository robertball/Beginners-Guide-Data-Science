Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 pound ground pork
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
2 teaspoons black pepper
1 tablespoon hot paprika (optional)
1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg (optional)
1 egg white
1/3 cup red wine
olive oil for brushing

Directions:
Place beef, pork, parsley, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Season with seasoned salt, pepper, paprika, and nutmeg. Add egg white and red wine; mix thoroughly until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate.
Roll the meat mixture into sticks about 1 inch thick by 3 inches long, using less than 1/4 cup of the mixture per stick. Brush the cevapcici lightly with olive oil.
Cook on preheated grill until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, about 12 minutes.

Description: 
This cevapcici (pronounced 'che-vap-chee-chee') recipe is from my husband's family who live in Trieste, Italy. I've added hot Hungarian paprika and nutmeg to mine, to make them spicier. These are great for summertime BBQ plain or brushed with your favorite BBQ sauce. Great for entertaining, as an appetizer served with tzatziki sauce.
