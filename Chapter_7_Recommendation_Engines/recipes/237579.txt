Ingredients:
Meatloaf:
1 onion, finely chopped
1 cup finely chopped mushroom
3/4 cup milk
2/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
Glaze:
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Mix onion, mushroom, milk, bread crumbs, eggs, and salt together in a large bowl. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to onion mixture; stir. Shape the beef mixture into a round loaf and place into a 5-quart slow cooker.
Cook on Low until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Whisk ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl; spoon over the meatloaf.
Continue cooking glazed meatloaf until the glaze is warmed, about 15 minutes.
Remove meatloaf to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
