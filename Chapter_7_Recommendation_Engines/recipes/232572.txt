Ingredients:
3 small turkey drumsticks
1/4 cup salt
water to cover
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Put turkey drumsticks in a large bowl with enough water to cover. Stir salt into water to dissolve.
Brine drumsticks in refrigerator for 2 hours; drain. Rinse drumsticks with clean water and pat dry.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush butter over drumsticks to coat; season with black pepper.
Pour chicken broth into a roasting pan. Lay turkey legs into the broth. Place a lid on the roasting pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
