Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef brisket
1 pound ground short rib
4 slices American cheese
8 slices precooked bacon
4 homemade buns
Lettuce
Tomato, sliced
Pickles
Ketchup
1 1/2 tablespoons madras curry powder
1 1/2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix curry powder, cayenne, 1/2 tablespoon cracked black pepper and 1 1/2 tablespoons sea salt until combined; set aside.
Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium high heat.
In a large mixing bowl, mix brisket and short rib until blended; season with salt and pepper. Separate into four balls and flatten into 3/4-inch thick patties. Season both sides of each patty with spice mixture.
Place patties on hot grill or grill pan, cooking for approximately three minutes per side for medium-rare, four minutes per side for medium; top burgers with 2 slices bacon and cover with cheese during the last minute of cooking. Grill buns, turning over once with tongs, until toasted. Cover the burger with the top bun.
Layer bottom bun with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and red onion before adding the burger and top bun from the grill. Serve immediately.
Serve ketchup and extra pickles on the side for those who want it.
