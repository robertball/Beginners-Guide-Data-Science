Description: 
THIS IS a perfect main dish when you're cooking for two. I've even used these hens as a stand-in for turkey on Thanksgiving Day when the group was not large.    I found this recipe among my mother's collection. She was always searching newspapers and magazines for new cooking ideas.        --Geraldine Grisdale                                                          Mt. Pleasant, Michigan
