Ingredients:
1/2 cup shredded habanero-flavored Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1/3 cup mayonnaise, or as needed
1/3 cup sour cream, or as needed
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 tablespoons canned diced jalapeno peppers
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, cooked, well drained
toothpicks
8 slices jalapeno bacon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine habanero-flavored Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, feta cheese, and diced jalapenos in a bowl; set aside.
Spread out a layer of plastic wrap and place chicken breasts on top. Dribble a few drops of water on the chicken to ensure even pounding. Cover with another layer of plastic wrap and pound chicken breasts to about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thickness.
Spread cheese mixture onto each chicken breast, add a thin layer of spinach, roll up, and secure with toothpicks.
Microwave bacon for 1 minute, then wrap around stuffed breasts. Set in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and turn on the oven's broiler.
Broil chicken, turning often, until bacon is crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Not your ordinary spinach-stuffed chicken breasts. I used some mayonnaise and some sour cream, and whatever I had on hand.
