Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup diced dried apples
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk
5 tablespoons powdered eggs
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 3/4 cups water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine whole wheat flour, dried apples, dry milk, powdered eggs, and baking powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake until well combined. Pour water and vegetable oil into small lidded containers.
Pour water over the whole wheat flour mixture when you're on the trail. Mix just until combined.
Heat a cast iron skillet over a camp stove. Grease with oil. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Tasty breakfast while backpacking. Light to carry and much more satisfying than a pack of instant oatmeal. Serve with yogurt, maple syrup, or brown sugar.
