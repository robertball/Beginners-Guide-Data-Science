Description: 
Holidays are so much easier since I started making this slow cooker chicken and dressing.  Making the dressing in the slow cooker frees up the ovens for other dishes on holidays. Sometimes I add the chicken; sometimes I don't.  I often assemble it weeks in advance and freeze it; then I let it thaw in the refrigerator before putting it in the slow cooker.
