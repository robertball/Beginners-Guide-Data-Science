Description: 
I developed this recipe as a last-minute alternative to traditional cold bean salad.  It's not overly spicy, and it went over well with both kids and adults.  For those who love curry, this is an easy way to add a perked-up vegetable to a summertime menu. Lemon juice can be used in place of rice vinegar. Can be served immediately or refrigerated to blend flavors. For faster preparation, substitute dried versions of any of the flavorings (adjusting the amounts).
