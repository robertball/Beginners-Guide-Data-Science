4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
Salt and pepper to taste
6 ounces grape tomatoes, halved

Heat the oil in a fry pan over medium-high heat. Place salmon in the pan flesh-side down and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn over to the other side and cook for approximately 3 minutes. Add in tomato halves around salmon and continue cooking for 2 minutes, or until salmon is cooked to your preference.
Remove the salmon from the pan and place on a platter. Add white wine to the pan and cook for 45 seconds with the tomatoes. Add in dill and stir. Serve the sauteed tomatoes over the salmon. Pass the lemon wedges at the table.
