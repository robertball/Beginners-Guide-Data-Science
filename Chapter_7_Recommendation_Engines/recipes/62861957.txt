Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed

2 bell peppers, chopped
2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes

1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts

Directions:
Put all ingredients except chicken into a large slow cooker and stir.  Put the chicken pieces on top and press down with a spoon until they're covered.  Cook on LOW for 6-7 hours.  Scoop out the chicken and shred with two forks.  Return chicken to the slow cooker, stir it into the chili and cook on LOW for 1/2 hour.  (Optional: Serve with your choice of shredded cheese and sour cream.)

Description: 
An incredibly easy and satisfying slow cooker recipe.  If you don't have fresh peppers, you can use frozen, pre-chopped ones from the grocery store and there is essentially no prep.  This is how I make/prefer it, but it can be easily modified; add onions, corn, diced jalapenos, fresh tomatoes from your garden, different types of beans, etc..  Use your imagination ... and a large slow cooker as this makes a lot!
