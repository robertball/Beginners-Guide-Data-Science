Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package dry fettuccine pasta
4 slices bacon, chopped
1 tablespoon bacon drippings
olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 small onion, chopped
14 ounces frozen shelled and deveined medium shrimp - thawed and patted dry
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
ground black pepper to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
4 cups baby spinach leaves
1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Brown the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes; stir occasionally. Drain all but 1 tablespoon of the drippings; pour the olive oil into the skillet. Stir in garlic and onion, and cook until the onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp, and cook just until pink and opaque, 2 to 3 more minutes. Mix in Italian seasoning, black pepper, and diced tomatoes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
With a spoon, move the shrimp to the outside of the skillet. Place the spinach in the center of the skillet, cover, and cook until just wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir the spinach into the shrimp. Mix in the tomato paste if you prefer a thicker sauce. Serve over cooked fettuccine.
