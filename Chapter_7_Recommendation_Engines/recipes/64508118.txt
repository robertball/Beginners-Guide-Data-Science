Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves
12 ounces tomatoes -- sliced
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 green peppers -- seeded and thinly sliced
2 tablespoons paprika
1 small red chili -- (optional)
2 tablespoons tomato puree
3 tablespoons chopped parsley
4 tablespoons lemon juice
4 6-ounce cutlets of whiting or cod
Salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix together the garlic, cumin, paprika, chili, tomato puree, parsley and lemon juice. Spread this mixture over the fish, cover and chill for about 30 minutes to let the flavor penetrate the fish.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Arrange half of the tomatoes and peppers in a baking dish. Cover with the fish, in one layer, then arrange the remaining tomatoes and peppers on top. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for about 45 minutes, until the fish is tender.
