Description: 
A complimentary blend of flavors resulting in a creamy Tex Mex filling for hollowed out peppers.  There is a bit of spice, but it is not overpowering, so play with the quantities to suit your palate.  Ground turkey or ground chicken can also be substituted in place of the chorizo sausage.  This mixture can also be used as burrito or quesadilla filling.
