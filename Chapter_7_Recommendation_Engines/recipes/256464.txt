Ingredients:
Pie Crust:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon sea salt, divided
1 cup unsalted butter, well chilled and cut into cubes
1/2 cup ice water
Filling:
1 3/4 pounds fresh cherries, stemmed and pitted (or frozen cherries, partially thawed)
1/2 cup Stevia In The Raw®
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons 2% milk
1 tablespoon Stevia In The Raw® (optional)

Directions:
In a food processor, pulse flour and salt to combine. Add butter and pulse until the size of small peas. Add 6 tablespoons water and pulse 15 times. (If dough is still dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough just comes together.)
Divide dough in half, shape into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
In a large bowl, combine cherries, stevia, cornstarch, and lemon juice.
On a lightly floured surface, roll half the dough into a 12-inch circle.
Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan, pressing gently into the corners. Trim edges so the dough hangs 1/4 inch over the sides. Refrigerate.
Roll out the rest of the dough as above, and cut into 3/4-inch wide strips.
On a lightly floured cookie sheet, place half the dough strips 1/2-inch apart, then weave the remaining strips through them in a perpendicular, alternating over, under pattern.
Remove crust from refrigerator and pour filling into it.
Slide lattice off the cookie sheet directly on top of the pie.
Trim lattice strips, leaving a 1/4-inch overhang.
Tuck ends of the strips under the edge of the bottom crust, then crimp the edge.
Brush top of the pie with milk and sprinkle with Sugar In The Raw, if desired.
Bake 30 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees F and bake until the juices are thick and bubbling, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Cool on a rack.
