Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Add butter gradually and beat until smooth. Beat into the egg yolk mixture.
Beat egg whites and salt together in another bowl until stiff peaks form. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar over and beat for 2 minutes more. Stir egg whites slowly into chocolate bowl. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours; overnight is best.
