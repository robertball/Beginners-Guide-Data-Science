Description: 
This cookie is so flaky and rich!  I like it because it's not too sweet.  My cousin Lynda gave me this recipe and I've been making it for years. This year I tried another 5 star cream cheese recipe I found on line and my family was very disppointed.  From now I'm going to stick with this one.  Very easy to make too.
