Ingredients:
olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
6 small carrots, peeled and sliced lengthwise
1/2 yellow onion, sliced into rings
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon maple syrup
Filling:
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 large zucchini, sliced lengthwise
12 grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise
2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with olive oil.
Pat tofu slices dry with a paper towel and lay on the prepared baking sheet. Lay carrots next to tofu and add onion. Sprinkle salt and pepper over tofu. Drizzle maple syrup over carrots.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Drain 1/2 the liquid from the chickpeas. Mash chickpeas in a large bowl with the remaining liquid, lemon juice, sea salt, and cumin to make the filling.
Turn over the baked tofu, carrots, and onion. Add zucchini and tomatoes. Continue baking until vegetables are tender but not mushy, 5 to 10 minutes more.
Arrange 1/3 the tofu on a serving plate. Top with some zucchini and a spoonful of chickpea filling. Add carrots and onion. Repeat layers, finishing with tofu on top. Sprinkle basil on top. Repeat with remaining tofu, vegetables, filling, and basil.

Description: 
An elegant, savory, and surprisingly easy way to prepare a vegan tofu dinner. I was served a similar dish at a very high-end restaurant, and decided to create my own version. Decorate with extra tomatoes and parsley and drizzle balsamic reduction on top (see footnote).
