Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups peeled, seeded, and shredded cucumber
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 5x9-inch loaf pans with cooking spray.
Place shredded cucumbers into a colander and let drain for about 30 minutes.
Stir eggs, vegetable oil, sugar, vanilla extract, drained cucumber, and pecans together in a large bowl. Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves in a separate bowl. Stir dry ingredients into the cucumber mixture until batter is thoroughly combined. Spoon batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake loaves in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let loaves cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing from pans to finish cooling on wire racks.
