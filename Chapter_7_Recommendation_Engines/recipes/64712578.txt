Ingredients:
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
pinch salt
pinch ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon maple syrup, or to taste
1 tablespoon peanut butter, or to taste
1 piece of cooked bacon, crumbled
1/2 banana, sliced

Directions:
1. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 1 tbsp milk. Set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, bring 1 cup milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg to a boil, stirring often. Mix in rolled oats and cook about 5 minutes, or until thickened.
3. Slowly pour beaten egg mixture into oats, stirring constantly. Continue to cook over medium-low heat until egg is fully cooked and oatmeal is very thick and creamy, about 5 minutes. (If oatmeal becomes too thick at this point, add additional milk until desired consistency is reached.)
4. Pour oatmeal into a heat safe bowl, and mix in maple syrup and peanut butter. Top with extra peanut butter (optional), banana slices, and crumbled bacon. Serve warm.
Note: This can be prepared the night before. Make the oatmeal as normal (leaving off banana and bacon until ready to eat), pour it into a heat safe container, and keep stored in the fridge. When ready to eat, microwave oatmeal until warm (extra milk may be needed, as oatmeal thickens substantially overnight), then top with cooked bacon and banana slices.

Description: 
Adding an egg to your regular oatmeal not only ups the protein content, but also makes for an extremely thick and creamy bowl of oatmeal. Mixing in peanut butter, banana, and bacon just makes it even better.
