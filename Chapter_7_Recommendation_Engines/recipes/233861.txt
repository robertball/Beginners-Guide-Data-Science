Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) bison flank steak
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (6 ounce) package fresh baby spinach
1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup chopped pitted kalamata olives

Directions:
Score bison flank steak on both sides by making shallow cuts at 1-inch intervals diagonally across the steak in a diamond pattern. Place bison flank steak between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, pound bison flank steak lightly into a 8x10-inch rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Discard plastic wrap. Place bison flank steak in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow bowl. For marinade, combine the 3 tablespoons oil, the lemon juice, the 2 cloves minced garlic, and the oregano in a medium bowl. Pour marinade over bison flank steak. Seal bag; turn to coat bison flank steak. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours, turning bag occasionally
For filling, heat the 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Cook the 2 cloves garlic in hot oil for 1 minute. Add spinach; cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes or until spinach begins to wilt. Drain spinach in a colander, pressing out any excess liquid with the back of a spoon. Coarsely chop spinach. Stir in feta cheese and kalamata olives; set aside.
Drain bison flank steak; discard marinade. Spread filling mixture evenly over bison flank steak to within 1 inch of edges. Starting from long edge, roll up bison flank steak into a spiral, making sure the ends stay tucked in. Using heavy 100-percent-cotton kitchen string, tie bison roll at 1-inch intervals. Place bison roll on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Insert an oven-going meat thermometer into the center of the bison roll.
Roast, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes or until internal temperature registers 135 degrees F. Cover with foil; let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Slice bison roll into 3/4-inch-thick slices.
