1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

Toss apples and lemon juice together in a bowl. Mix in candy bar pieces. Fold whipped topping into the salad. Dust cinnamon on top. Keep chilled until ready to serve.

Description: 
Only 4 to 5 ingredients. Only takes 5 to 10 minutes to make. You can also make it with sugar-free whipped topping and sugar-free candy bars (great for diabetics). I like to use a combination of red, green, and golden apples in the summer mostly because the different colors are pretty. I also use just red and green apples for a Christmas dessert. You can use any combination of your favorite apples.
