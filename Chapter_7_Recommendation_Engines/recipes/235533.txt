Ingredients:
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 Granny Smith apple, sliced into 1/16-inch thick rounds
1 red apple (such as Paula), sliced into 1/16-inch thick rounds
fleur de sel (sea salt) to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 170 degrees F (77 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly oil the paper.
Stir lime juice, water, and sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Soak apple slices in lime juice mixture to combine flavors, 2 to 5 minutes. Drain and discard liquid.
Arrange apple slices in a single layer about 1/8-inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle with Fleur de Sel.
Bake apples in the preheated oven until dried and crisp, about 4 hours. Cool completely before carefully peeling from the parchment.
