Wendy's Frosty Recipe

Ingredients:
1 CUP Nonfat (skim) milk
2 TBSP Sugar-Free, Fat Free Vanilla Pudding Mix
1 TSP Vanilla Extract
1 TSP Unsweetened Cocoa
1/2 TBSP Splenda (2-3 small packets)
2 TBL Cool-Whip Free (optional)
7 Ice Cubes

Directions:
Place all in a blender that chops ice well. Blend until all is well mixed and all of the ice is chopped up. Mixture should be nice and thick. I like to pour the drink in a Starbucks cup or some other attractive-looking container!
This recipe makes almost 20 ounces, which I personally think is too much for one serving. I highly suggest dividing this recipe in half or share the full recipe version with someone special.
