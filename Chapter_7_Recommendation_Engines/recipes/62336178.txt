Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
½ cup diced onions
1 tablespoon minced fresh flat leaf parsley
1 cup diced mushrooms (button or cremini)
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 cup sour cream
2 cans (14-1/2 oz each) French-sliced green beans, drained
Topping:
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers
4 tablespoon melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium sauté or fry pan large enough to hold all the ingredients.  Add the diced onions, minced parsley, and diced mushrooms and sauté slowly, without boiling until onions are translucent and mushrooms are giving off their juice, stirring as needed.
Add flour, salt, pepper, and lemon juice; cook for a couple of minutes so flour isn’t raw.  Add sour cream, stir to combine, then add green beans and stir again until combined.
Put mixture in 10x6” or 9” square baking dish.  Top with grated cheese.  Mix crushed crackers and melted butter together with a fork, then distribute evenly over the top.  Heat through in preheated oven until bubbly and brown, around 20-30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe has been in my family for as long as I can remember.  We only got to have it at holidays.

Now, I use it for a special go-to side dish all year long - made from scratch but so easy there's no reason not to.
