1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons Baileys Irish cream
2 teaspoons Irish whiskey
not quite 1 cup milk
1 egg
8 tablespoons melted butter or margarine

Directions:
grease muffin-tin (paper liners stick to much to finished product)
Preheat oven to 375.
In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
Stir well.
In a 1-cup measure, mix Baileys and whiskey.
Add enough milk to measure 1 cup.
Whisk egg in a bowl with whiskey-milk mixture.
Whisk in melted butter.
Gently stir liquid into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Spoon into muffin tin.
Bake at 375 for 20 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.

Description: 
The best place to shop for ingredients is at the liqueur mart.
If you want to try a slight variation, try leaving out the whiskey and milk and just adding a cup of Baileys instead, it's really good.
