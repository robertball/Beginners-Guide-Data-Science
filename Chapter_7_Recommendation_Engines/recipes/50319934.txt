Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup shortening (I use butter flavored)
1 1/4 cups sugar
3 eggs
1 cup buttermilk (or 7 oz whole milk for a more open texture cake)
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Put everything in a bowl and mix slow first to combine and then at medium speed for 2 min. However, I sometimes do the traditional creaming of the butter + shortening, then add the sugar, then the eggs, the milk and flavoring and finally the flour.
Pour into greased and floured cake pan(s). You can do one tall cake or two 8" layers.
Bake at 350 F until done.
For a special touch, I make a syrup of water, sugar, fresh squeezed lime juice and brandy or rum and pour it hot over the cooled cake. It's in my recipe box as 'Brandy Syrup'.
If making layers, spread your filling of choice between them. I specially like guava jelly.

Description: 
I've had this recipe for 25 years and it's my standard cake. For variety, I just add other flavor extracts (almond, lemon or lime, coconut, brandy or any combination thereof)
