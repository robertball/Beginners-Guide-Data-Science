Ingredients:
4 ears of corn
2 cups of water

Directions:
Shuck the corn and remove the silk.
Pour the water into the pot and insert the steamer basket.
Stack the corn like a pound key.
Put the lid on the pot and close the vent.
Press the meat/stew option and adjust the time to 2 minutes.
Use the quick release method when the timer goes off and serve immediately.

Description: 
This method probably isn't any faster than the tradition method of boiling corn but I can put everything in the pot and walk away, a bonus when I'm preparing several other dishes.
