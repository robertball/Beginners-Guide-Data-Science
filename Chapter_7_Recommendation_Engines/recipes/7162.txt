Ingredients:
2 cups Herman Sourdough Starter
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup raisins
1 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup margarine, softened
1/2 cup margarine
1/4 cup milk
1 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Bring Herman Starter to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour one 9x13 inch baking pan.
Stir together Herman Starter, oil and beaten eggs.
Stir together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt and white sugar. Stir in nuts and raisins. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and stir well. Pour into the prepared pan and sprinkle with the topping.
To Make Topping: Combine the 1 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in 1/4 cup softened butter, until the mixture resembles very coarse crumbs.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes. While still hot pour glaze over the top and serve.
To Make Glaze: In a small saucepan, melt 1/2 cup butter or margarine. Stir in the milk and 1 cup brown sugar. Bring to a boil and let boil for 3 minutes. Immediately pour over hot cake.
