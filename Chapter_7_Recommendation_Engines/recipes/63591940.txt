Description: 
I had been trying out a lot of vegan recipes and my boyfriend and I both agreed that this was by far the best and most simple of everything we tried!  The nutritional yeast really adds a creaminess to the soup and all the different chunky textures and flavors of the spices are amazing.  I would definitely recommend adding the garnishes (cilantro and tortilla chips for sure!)
