Ingredients:
6- Garlic cloves, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons good, extra virgin olive oil
1- large yellow onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh chopped basil
3 tablespoons chopped, curly parsley
3 tablespoons chopped flat leaf Italian parsley
1 tablespoon chopped oregano
1- 1 lb. can whole peeled tomatoes
1- 6 oz can tomato paste
2- 5oz cans tomato sauce UNSALTED
3/4 GOOD red wine, I use Cabernet.
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and onion.Saute until translucent and aromatic. Add 1 TSP of kosher salt. In a food processor or blender (which I prefer) combine tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, basil, oregano, tomato sauce, black papper, kosher salt, and sauteed onion and garlic mixture. Blend on medium speed until it is smooth. Over low heat, simmer marinara for at least 1 hour. Add red wine and simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes and serve!
I serve this with pretty much every pasta dish.

Description: 
My grandmother made this recipe for 50 years. The only changes I have made are the canned plum tomatoes and the use of a blender/food processor. It's a family recipe from the old country, Castagnole Monferrato. GUSTARE!
