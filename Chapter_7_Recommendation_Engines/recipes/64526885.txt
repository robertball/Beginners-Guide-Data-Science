Ingredients:
2 turkey legs (approx 1.75lbs)
2 tbsp ghee/bacon fat/coconut oil
1 tsp whole coriander
1/2 tsp whole cloves
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp ancho chili pepper
1/8 tsp garlic
1/8 tsp smoked paprika

Directions:
First you’ll want to take all of your dry ingredients and add them into your mortar and pestle and crush into a fine powder.
While you’re working on that, preheat the oven to 350ºF.
After you’ve mixed the ingredients, heat your fat and brush it on all sides of the legs as well as the inside of the baking dish you’re using.  Then cover legs with the dry rub.
Bake for 90 minutes, and enjoy how the house starts to smell.
When you’ve wrapped that up, let them sit for around 5 minutes to cool, and dig in.  Silverware is optional.
