Description: 
My step-daughter, being incredibly picky, wanted an apple pie for her graduation, but no crust. So I thought cobbler or crisp, but every recipe had something in the topping she didn't like (oatmeal, granola, nuts, etc.), but she still wanted a crunchy topping.  My brainstorm after reading recipes was a combination of the base of several apple crisp toppings, but with crispy rice to give it that crunch.  However, it turned out sort of like an cobbler topping, so it is Sarah's Apple Crispler.
