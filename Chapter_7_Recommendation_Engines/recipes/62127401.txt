4 eggs
1/4 tsp salt
Finely grated zest of one lemon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Melt one cup of butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Gradually stir in sugar. Blend well.

In a separate bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Fold into egg mixture. Add milk and fold until batter is well combined.
