Ingredients:
4 cups canned sliced peaches with juice
1 cup frozen blueberries
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch glass baking dish.
Pour peaches into the prepared dish, and sprinkle the blueberries over the peaches. In a bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, and baking powder until thoroughly combined. With a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture to make a crumble, and spread the crumble mixture over the fruit.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow to cool; filling will thicken as it cools.

Description: 
The easiest dessert that everybody loves.  I got the idea from my mom and she got it from my grandma. The thing I changed is, I don't use a cake mix. I use items from my pantry, and I add blueberries.
