2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 pound beef stew meat
1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth
1/2 cup water

1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
salt to taste
2 serrano chile peppers, seeded and chopped

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook beef until evenly brown. Pour off excess fat. Stir in tomato paste, beef broth and water. Season with garlic, chili powder, cumin, black pepper, salt and serrano peppers. Reduce heat, and simmer for 8 to 12 hours.
Dissolve cornstarch in a small amount of water, and stir into simmering stew until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
A Mexican beef stew smothered in a semi-spicy gravy. Simple to make, but tastes wonderful.  Serve with mashed potatoes, rice, and/or homemade tortillas. Cooking time may be cut, but the meat will be less tender.
