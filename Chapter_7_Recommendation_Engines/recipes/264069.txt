Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons butter
1/2 pound asparagus, trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces
8 eggs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
7 tablespoons milk
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter in a 9-inch nonstick pan over medium heat and cook asparagus, stirring occasionally, until soft but still firm to the bite, 10 to 15 minutes.
Beat eggs in a bowl until frothy. Stir in Parmesan cheese and milk; season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture over asparagus and cook until eggs are set, 10 to 15 minutes.
Invert frittata onto a plate and garnish with parsley.

Description: 
I love making a frittata whenever I want a quick meal. I always have eggs in the fridge and you can use a variety of vegetables. I like asparagus the best, though. This is also a KETO-friendly recipe.
