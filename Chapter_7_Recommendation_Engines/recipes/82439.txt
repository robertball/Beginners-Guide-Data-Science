Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon brown sugar
5 tablespoons olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
Stir Fry:
4 boneless pork loin chops, cut into bite sized pieces
5 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon hot chile paste
5 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into strips
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup blanched slivered almonds
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together rice wine vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Stir in pork pieces, cover, and leave at room temperature for 1/2 hour.
Heat a large wok over medium heat. Toast almonds in hot, dry wok until golden brown and fragrant.
Heat vegetable oil in wok over medium-high heat. Stir in marinated pork pieces, ginger, and chile paste. (Discard remaining marinade.) Mix in teriyaki sauce, and increase heat to high; cook, stirring constantly, until pork is white. Stir in peppers, and continue to stir fry until most of the liquid has evaporated. Top with toasted almond slivers and fresh mint.

Description: 
A very easy, spicy stir fry!  Adjust spice to your particular taste! Best with marinade, but in a pinch, it's not necessary! Can be chicken, beef whatever meat or cut of meat you have on hand! Enjoy with basmati or sticky rice.
