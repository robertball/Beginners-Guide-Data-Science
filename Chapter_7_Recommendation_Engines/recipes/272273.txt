Ingredients:
1 pound white fish fillets, such as cod or tilapia
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pat fish dry with paper towels and cut into 1x3-inch sticks.
Place flour in a shallow dish. Beat egg in a separate shallow dish. Combine panko, Parmesan cheese, parsley, paprika, and pepper in a third shallow dish.
Coat each fish stick in flour, then dip in beaten egg, and finally coat in seasoned panko mixture.
Spray the basket of the air fryer with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange 1/2 the sticks in the basket, making sure none are touching. Spray the top of each stick with cooking spray.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes. Flip fish sticks and cook an additional 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining fish sticks.

Description: 
Homemade fish sticks that are perfectly crisp on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside. This was my first attempt at making them in an air fryer, and the results were quite impressive. Dip in tarter or cocktail sauce.
