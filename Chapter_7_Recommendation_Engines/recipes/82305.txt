Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup water
1 cup dry grits
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, sliced into 1/2 inch pieces
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup diced onion
1 cup raspberry preserves

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the water and milk. Bring to boil, then stir in the grits, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until thick, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cheese, and remove from the heat.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until browned. Stir in the preserves, and simmer until sausage and mushrooms are coated and sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Serve over cheese grits.
