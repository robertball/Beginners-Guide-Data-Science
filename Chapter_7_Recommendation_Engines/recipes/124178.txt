Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - julienned
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 medium green pepper, julienned
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons soy sauce
6 cups torn fresh spinach
1 cup cherry tomato halves

Directions:
Drain pineapple, reserving 3 tablespoons juice in a small bowl; set pineapple aside. (Discard remaining juice or save for another use.) In a skillet or wok, stir-fry chicken in oil for 5 minutes or until no longer pink. Add green pepper; stir-fry for 2-4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, add brown sugar and cornstarch to pineapple juice; mix well. Stir in ketchup, vinegar and soy sauce until smooth; add to skillet and cook until thickened. On a large serving platter, arrange spinach, pineapple and tomatoes. Top with chicken and green pepper; serve immediately.
