Description: 
I have made baked macaroni and cheese since I was little. I stumbled upon this recipe through experimentation and then modified until I love it! I even brought this to a party with a bunch of people from around the US, and no one could believe it was so easy to make! It tastes exactly the same! Not only is it super easy to make, the clean-up is quick!
