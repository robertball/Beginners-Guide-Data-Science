1/4 cup soy sauce
Dash of Black Pepper
4 ounces dried thin Chinese noodles
8 cups Fresh Spinach, stemmed and coarsely chopped

Directions:
Combine the vegetable stock, soy sauce, and pepper in a large pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
Add the noodles, spinach, corn, and green onions. When the soup returns to a boil, cover and cook, keeping the liquid at a boil, until the noodles are al dente and the spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. As the noodles cook, stir occasionally with a fork to separate.
