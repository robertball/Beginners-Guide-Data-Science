Ingredients:
1 cup skin-on, split black lentils (urad dal)
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 onion, chopped
4 green chile peppers, cut into large chunks
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 cup water
salt to taste
1 large tomato, chopped
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place the lentils into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak 4 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse.
Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed sauce pan over medium heat; cook the onion, green chile peppers, garlic, and ginger in the hot oil until the onions are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir the lentils into the onion mixture with 1 cup water; season with salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir the tomato, garam masala, and turmeric into the mixture. Cook until the lentils are cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Garnish with the cilantro to serve.

Description: 
This is a very comforting dal for a cold day. Urad dal is stickier and heavier than other dals, so this is a thick-style dal. Serve with fresh phulkas with some chopped onion, tomato, and cucumber (kheera) salad on the side for crunch.
