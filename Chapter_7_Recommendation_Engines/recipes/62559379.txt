Ingredients:
2 Cups Rolled Oats
2 Cups Milk (I use vanilla unsweetened almond milk)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup dried cranberries
-you can add nuts to this recipe too! Or dried cherries or raisins.
- for a sweeter version add honey, agave, maple syrup, or splenda if you like.

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl, add to baking dish sprayed w/cooking spray. Bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes uncovered. To re-heat this I pop a slice in the microwave for 30 seconds then stick it in my toaster oven to get it crispy
