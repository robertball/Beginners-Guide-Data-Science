Ingredients:
1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon vinegar, balsamic
1/2 large shallot(s) minced
1/2 teaspoon mustard, Dijon
salt to taste
pepper, black ground to taste
1 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
6 ounce(s) asparagus
2 1/2 cup(s) lettuce, mixed greens

Directions:
Heat a grill or grill pan to medium. In a small ungreased skillet, toast the pumpkin seeds over medium heat until they look lightly browned and puffed up a bit, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape onto a plate to stop the cooking.
In a cup, combine the lemon juice, vinegar, shallot, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk in the oil until well blended.
Place the asparagus in a shallow bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and turn the spears to coat. Grill the asparagus, turning often, until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes, depending on thickness.
Transfer to a cutting board and cut on the diagonal into 1" pieces. In a large bowl, toss the asparagus and greens with the remaining dressing. Divide the salad among 4 plates and sprinkle each serving evenly with pumpkin seeds.
