Ingredients:
For the Schnitzel:
4 boneless pork chops (1 pound total)
1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs
1 teaspoon paprika
4 tablespoon neutral oil
For the Sauce:
3/4 cup chicken stock
2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Lay the cutlets one at a time on a cutting board under a sheet of plastic wrap. Pound them gently and evenly until very thin, ideally 1/8-inch thick. Trim any fat from the edges, and cut small slits to prevent curling.
Mix flour, salt, and pepper in one bowl, egg and milk in a second bowl, and paprika and bread crumbs in a third. Whisk the egg and milk well.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until some breadcrumb dropped into the oil sputters.
Dredge the cutlets in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs and cook, at most two simultaneously, for three minutes on one side and four on the second, cooked through. Remove to a warm oven to keep warm until all the cutlets are cooked.
Turn the heat to low and add the chicken stock, scraping up any brown bits in the pan.
While it reduces slightly, mix together the dill, salt, and sour cream. Pour some of the chicken stock into the bowl and whisk quickly until incorporated, then pour the contents of the bowl into the skillet. Heat gently until just warm and thickened. Season to taste, and serve with the cutlets.
