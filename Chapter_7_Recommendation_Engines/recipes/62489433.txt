Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Butter
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp. vanilla
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking powder
1 Tbsp. pumpkin pie spice
3 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Cream together butter and sugar.
Add eggs and vanilla.
Sift together and add dry ingredients.
Mix thoroughly and add your favorite season nuts if you wish. I happened to have had some caramelized sugar I had previously made and I crushed this up and added to the top of some of the cookies just before baking.
Chill for a couple of hours if you wish.
Drop small spoonfuls onto cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  Put some sugar in a small bowl. Take a glass, moisten the bottom, and place in sugar: gently flatten each drop of cookie dough with the sugared glass bottom.
Bake for 5-7 minutes.

Description: 
If a home made pumpkin pie and a soft sugar cookie had little cookies of their own...well, let these speak for themselves.
