Ingredients:
3 onions, sliced thin
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 TBsp Sugar
1 # of Brussel Sprouts, cleaned, trimmed and halved
1 tsp of fresh thyme
salt and pepper to taste
4 cups of chicken stock
1/2 cup sour cream
1-2 dashes of hot pepper sauce (I like Franks)

Directions:
1.Put the onions into a pan with the olive oil, cover and sweat over a gentle heat for about 30-40 minutes until the onions are very tender and soft.
2.Sprinkle with sugar and cook, uncovered, for another 10-15 minutes until the onions are light brown in color.
3.Add the sprouts and thyme and stir around.
4.Pour in the stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer for about ten minutes until the sprouts are just tender.
5.Cool slightly, then blend to smooth consistency with stick blender or blender. If using a blender, do it in 2 batches.
6.Reheat gently if necessary and adjust seasoning.
7.Serve hot with a spoonful of sour cream in each bowl and a few dashes of hot sauce.
