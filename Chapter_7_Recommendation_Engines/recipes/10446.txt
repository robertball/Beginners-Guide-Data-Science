Ingredients:
3/4 cup shortening
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1/2 cup light molasses
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Cream together shortening and brown sugar.  Stir in egg and molasses and mix well. Fold in dry ingredients and stir.  Cover and chill until firm (1 - 2 hours).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll dough into small balls (I use a small melon baller to help with this) and roll in white sugar.  Place on lightly greased cookie sheets.
Bake 9 - 10 minutes.  Leave on cookie sheet one minute until set.
