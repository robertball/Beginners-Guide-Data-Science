Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 - 2 tablespoons Sauterne white wine
Garlic Salt to taste
Black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Melt the butter in a skillet large enough to toss your vegetable of choice.  Cook on low/medium heat just until butter begins to brown.  Be careful not to burn.  Once the butter begins to brown it will take no time for it to burn.  It will have a nice nutty smell.  At this point add your favorite white wine and garlic salt with pepper if desired.  Add your cooked vegetable of choice and toss.
