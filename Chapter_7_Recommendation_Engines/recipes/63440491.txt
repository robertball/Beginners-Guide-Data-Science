Ingredients:
1 pound bay scallops
2 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter
2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic
¼ cup finely-chopped fresh onion
½ cup white wine

Directions:
Rinse scallops and pat dry with paper towels.
In a non-stick skillet on medium-high, cook clarified butter, garlic, and onions for about two minutes, stirring continuously. Add scallops. Increase heat to high. Moving constantly, pan-sear scallops, tossing for about 2-3 minutes, making sure all sides get slightly golden brown. Transfer scallops to serving plates as soon as scallops are opaque throughout (or close to).
Add wine to drippings in pan. Cook for one to two minutes, mixing continuously. Scrape sauce in pan, mixing it well, and pour over scallops just before serving.
