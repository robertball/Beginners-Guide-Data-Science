Description: 
This spicy green sauce is as full of flavor as it is of color. Use it raw as a dip with falafel, vegetables, sandwiches and wraps. Add a fresh dollop to soups, rice, pasta, or egg dishes for an extra spicy boost of flavor. It also works wonderfully as a marinade on meat or fish. Covered with a thin layer of olive oil, it will keep up to two weeks in the refrigerator. It's also vegan, gluten-free, low sugar, and low sodium, making it perfect for almost any diet.
