Ingredients:
1 cup softened butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon peppermint extract
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
48 white chocolate kisses with candy cane stripes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix in flour, baking soda, and salt. Shape dough into 1-inch balls and place on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 9 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and press a white chocolate kiss in the center of each cookie. Immediately place the baking sheets in the freezer so the candy does not melt. Remove after 15 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough.

Description: 
I made this for my family and they all love it! The most important thing is to stick the cookies in the freezer right after putting the kisses on so that they don't melt into a puddle of chocolate. I learned the hard way! Sprinkle the dough before baking with crushed candy, if you like.
