Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) bar German sweet chocolate
1/2 cup water
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups sugar
4 eggs, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
COCONUT-PECAN FROSTING
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup sugar
3 egg yolks, lightly beaten
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a saucepan over low heat, stir chocolate and water until chocolate is melted. Cool. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add chocolate mixture and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add alternately with buttermilk to creamed mixture. In another mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Line a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan with waxed paper. Grease and flour the paper. Spread batter evenly in pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes; invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Remove waxed paper. For frosting, combine milk, sugar, egg yolks, butter and vanilla in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in coconut and pecans. Beat until frosting is cool and reaches desired spreading consistency. Place cake on a serving platter; spread frosting over top and sides.

Description: 
This moist, flavorful cake was the traditional birthday cake at our house when I was growing up. Everyone requested it. I especially like the sweet coconut-pecan frosting.                           --Lisa Andis, Morristown, Indiana
