Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 pound hot Italian sausage
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 bell peppers, diced
3 Anaheim chile peppers, diced
1 large onion, diced
2 jalapeno peppers, minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 (15 ounce) cans chili beans
4 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
3 (15 ounce) cans dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon crushed black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat a very large skillet over medium heat. Add beef and sausage; cook and stir until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and transfer to a large pot.
Heat olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add bell peppers, Anaheim chile peppers, onion, jalapeno peppers, and garlic; cook and stir until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir into beef mixture.
Stir chili beans, diced tomatoes, kidney beans, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, salt, cayenne, black pepper, and cinnamon into the beef and peppers mixture. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low and cover; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 3 hours.
