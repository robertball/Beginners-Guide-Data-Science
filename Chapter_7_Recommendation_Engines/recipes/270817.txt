Ingredients:
2 cups chopped cauliflower
1 cup diced yellow potatoes
1 1/4 cups chickpea flour (besan)
3/4 cup water
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon salt
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 serving cooking spray

Directions:
Combine cauliflower, potatoes, chickpea flour, water, red onion, salt, garlic, curry powder, coriander, cayenne, and cumin in a large bowl. Set aside to rest for 10 minutes.
Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Spoon 2 tablespoons of cauliflower mixture into the basket and flatten. Repeat this as many times as your basket space allows without the pakoras touching. Mist the top of each pakora with non-stick spray.
Cook for 8 minutes. Flip and cook 8 additional minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter.

All the things you love about pakoras but without the guilt by air frying instead of deep frying. Don't forget the yogurt dipping sauce!
