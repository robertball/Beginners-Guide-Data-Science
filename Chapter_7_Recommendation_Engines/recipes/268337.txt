Ingredients:
1 pound celery root, peeled and quartered
3 cups vegetable broth
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 pinch salt to taste
1 pinch ground white pepper to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
Croutons:
2 slices Italian bread, cubed
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer, add celery root pieces, and simmer until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain.
Place celery root in a blender and process until smooth. Transfer puree to a pot, add vegetable broth, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add cream and cook until hot, but don't boil. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and toast bread cubes until dry and lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with chopped parsley and croutons.

Description: 
Celery soup is one of my favorite soups. This version is very thick; if you like a thinner soup, you can add some milk in the end.
