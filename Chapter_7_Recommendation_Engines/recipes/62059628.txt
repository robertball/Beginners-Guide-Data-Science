Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup of cooked rice
2 cups of shredded cheese
1 1/2-2 chicken breasts, shredded
3/4 cup fresh broccoli, chopped
3/4 cup chopped mushrooms
1 can of cream of mushroom soup (cream of celery or chicken works, too)
1 can of water chesnuts, drained and chopped
salt and pepper to taste
cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
Boil rice (I cook mine in one cup water, one cup chicken broth).
While rice is cooking, shred boiled chicken breasts and place in large casserole dish.  Add rice and other ingredients; stir well, then spread the top so it's even.  Bake at 375 for 30-45 minutes or until nicely browned and bubbly.
Note:  I make this dish without chicken (and chicken broth) for my vegetarian friends.  Just add more veggies.
