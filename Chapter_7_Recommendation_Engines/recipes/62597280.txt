Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cans diced tomatoes
1 tbsp fresh basil chiffonade
6 eggs
1/4 cup parmisan cheese, shredded
olive oil
salt and pepper
1 loaf Italian bread

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400F. Slice loaf on the diagonal into 1 inch thick slices and arrange on a baking sheet. Drizzle w/ olive oil and season w/ salt and pepper. Bake for 15 min and set aside. Leave oven on.
While crustini is baking heat more olive oil in an oven proof skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute just until fragrant, about 3-4 min. Add the tomatoes and season w/ salt and pepper.  Simmer, stirring frequently until crustini is done cooking.
Make 6 wells in the tomatoes and crack an egg into each well. Do Not stir or scramble. Sprinkle the parmisan cheese and basil chiffonade over the top.  Move skillet to preheated oven. Bake until whites are just set and yolk is still runny, about 6 min.
To serve: use a large spoon to scoop an egg on top of each crustini then spoon any remaining tomatoes over the top. DIG IN!!!
