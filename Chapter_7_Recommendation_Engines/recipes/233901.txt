1 1/2 tablespoons pickle relish

4 leaves lettuce (optional)
4 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Mix tuna, mayonnaise, pickle relish, onion, celery, lemon juice, and garlic salt together in a bowl. Lay 1 lettuce leaf on each tortilla. Spoon tuna mixture in a line across the middle of each tortilla. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling in a burrito-style.

Description: 
A super fun and easy way to serve the usual tuna fish. Just wrap in a tortilla! My kids have been loving these for years, as I did when I was a kid. Awesome for lunch boxes, just wrap in plastic wrap or foil. The kids love calling them 'Tor-tunas'!
