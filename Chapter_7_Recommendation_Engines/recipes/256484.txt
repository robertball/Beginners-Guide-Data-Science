Ingredients:
1 cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
1 cup unsalted butter, sliced
2 cups white sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2/3 cup sour cream
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
Frosting:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
3 tablespoons Irish cream liqueur, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
Pour stout beer into a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 1 cup sliced butter; heat until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in white sugar and cocoa powder until dissolved. Remove from heat.
Mix sour cream, eggs, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract together in a bowl. Stir into beer mixture. Whisk flour and baking soda into the beer mixture until batter is smooth; pour into the greased pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake; cool to room temperature on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. Remove ring and transfer cake to a serving platter.
Beat 1/2 cup butter and cream cheese together in a bowl. Add vanilla extract. Mix in confectioners' slowly until icing is smooth. Add Irish cream liqueur 1 tablespoon at a time to thin frosting to a spreading consistency. Spread frosting over cooled cake.
