Ingredients:
1 pound fat-trimmed pork loin
2 (8 ounce) onions
1 (8 ounce) sweet potato
2 carrots
1/2 pound banana or hubbard squash
2 parsnips
1 clove garlic
1 (8 ounce) red bell pepper
2 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1 (10 ounce) package petite frozen peas
Salt and pepper
1 bunch Cilantro sprigs, rinsed, or thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
Rinse pork and pat dry. Cut into 3/4-inch chunks.
In a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, stir pork often until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel onions and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Peel the sweet potato, carrots, squash, and parsnips; cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Peel and mince or press garlic. Rinse bell pepper; stem, seed, and cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips.
To pan, add onions, sweet potato, carrots, squash, parsnips, garlic, and 1 cup broth. Cover pan and cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; add a few  tablespoons of water if mixture begins sticking to pan.
Add 1 more cup broth, along with the bell pepper, tomato sauce, lime juice, and cayenne to taste. Return to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until meat and vegetables are tender when pierced, about 12 to 15 minutes longer. If stew sticks to pan or gets thicker than desired, add more broth as needed.
Add peas and stir occasionally until hot, about 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into soup bowls and garnish with cilantro.
