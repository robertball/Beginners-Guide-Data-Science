Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 2 quart casserole dish with cooking spray.
In a large pot of salted water, boil noodles until al dente. Drain well.
In a medium saucepan, combine flour, butter, and salt. Stir until butter is melted and ingredients are combined evenly. Add milk, and whisk until the sauce thickens (usually it is at the proper consistency by the time it begins to boil). Add cheese to mixture,  and whisk until cheese is melted and mixture is well blended. Stir in tuna, peas, and noodles. Spread evenly in prepared dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.

Description: 
Rod said it was too dry, so maybe try 20 minutes bake time, rather than the original 30.  I put some bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on top before baking.  Also used mild cheddar rather than sharp, and put in extra for a cheesier flavor.  Rod ate two helpings and ate ate one bowl, and we polished off half the casserole lickity split.Modified from: Tuna Noodle Casserole I
