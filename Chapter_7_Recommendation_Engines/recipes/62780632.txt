Description: 
The main ingredient in this tasty sauce is grapefruit juice.  Don't worry, the bitterness disappears when you reduce the sauce, leaving only a sweet tang.  Don't be afraid to try it!  You won't be sorry - once I got this recipe from a friend, I began making double batches to keep in the refrigerator!  It goes wonderfully with pork, chicken or seafood and is also delicious as a dipping sauce.
