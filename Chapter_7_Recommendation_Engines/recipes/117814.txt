Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/8 teaspoons paprika, divided
3 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup tomato paste
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon reduced-sodium chicken bouillon crystals
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 1/2 pounds chicken tenderloins

Directions:
In a small saucepan, saute onion and 1/8 teaspoon paprika in 1 teaspoon oil until tender. Stir in the water, tomato paste, bay leaf, bouillon and Italian seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, oregano and remaining paprika. Add chicken; seal bag and shake to coat.
In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook half of the chicken in 1 teaspoon oil for 2-3 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm; repeat with remaining chicken and oil. Remove bay leaf from sauce. Serve over chicken.

My friend made this meal for my husband and I after our first child was born. I trimmed it down, and now it's low in fat and carbohydrates. When shopping for chicken tenderloins, remember that some companies label the product chicken tenders. -Beth Ann Stein of Richmond, Indiana
