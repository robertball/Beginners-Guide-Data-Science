Description: 
This is very good. Original recipe calls for large can of whole drained tomatoes but since I didn't have this I used a large can of pureed tomatoes which I had to cooked for about 30 minutes to reduce the liquid. It was better the next day because more of the liquid from the cooked zucchini was absorbed.
