Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 (15 ounce) can navy beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon butter
2 3/4 tablespoons whole wheat bread crumbs
1/2 (8 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
2 3/4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 1/4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss tomatoes, garlic, oil, vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a 9x13-inch metal baking pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until tomatoes are shriveled, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, stir in navy beans, and return to the oven to heat through, about 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Toast bread crumbs in the hot butter, stirring often, until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Set aside.
At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Add tomato mixture, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and parsley, tossing to coat. Serve sprinkled with bread crumbs and remaining Parmesan cheese.
