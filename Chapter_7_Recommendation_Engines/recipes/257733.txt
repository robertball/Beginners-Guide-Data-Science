Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup purple yam powder, or more to taste
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or grease lightly.
Mix sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla extract, salt, baking powder, purple yam powder, and flour, in this order, in a large bowl until dough is well blended. Drop tablespoons of dough onto the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies look firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool for at least 5 minutes before gently transferring to a wire rack.

Description: 
A simple recipe for purple yam cookies. These taste awesome! They're very soft and cake-like in texture. These are dome-shaped once they bake. You can flatten them as desired.

This is a flexible recipe. You can add a teaspoon (or more) of baking soda instead of baking powder if you want a thinner cookie. I think you can top these with some white chocolate chips after baking.
