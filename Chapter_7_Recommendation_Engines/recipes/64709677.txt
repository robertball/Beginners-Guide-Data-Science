Ingredients:
1 lbs 93% lean ground turkey
1 medium zucchini, shredded (about 1 cup)
1 medium onion, shredded (about 3/4 cup)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp vegetable oil
2 slices multi-grain bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/4 cup milk
2 large eggs
2 tbsps grated Parmesan cheese
1 tbsp fresh chopped parsley
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tbsp olive oil
1/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 9x13 pan.
2. In a medium saucepan, saute zucchini and onion in 1 tbsp vegetable oil over medium-high heat until softened, about 8 minutes. Add in minced garlic and cook an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow mixture to cool to room temperature.
3. In a small bowl, combine cubed bread with milk. Allow bread to soak until the milk is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Remove bread from bowl and gently squeeze to remove excess milk. Place bread in a food processor, and pulse 2-4 times until mixture forms fine crumbs resembling wet sand. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, combine ground turkey with sauteed zucchini mixture, bread crumbs, oregano, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add in Parmesan, parsley, and eggs, and mix thoroughly.
5. Using a large cookie or ice cream scoop, form meat mixture into 12 large meatballs.
6. Place 1/3 cup all-purpose flour in a shallow dish. Dredge meatballs in flour, and place 1-inch apart in prepared pan. Drizzle 1 tbsp olive oil over meatballs.
7. Cook in preheated oven until meatballs are lightly browned on top, and no longer pink in the center (or reach internal temperature of 160 degrees), about 30-38 minutes.

Description: 
Turkey meatballs with zucchini baked right in. We make them into large meatballs because they are basically a meal in and of themselves, but feel free to make them into smaller sizes! Also great with pesto and tomatoes!
