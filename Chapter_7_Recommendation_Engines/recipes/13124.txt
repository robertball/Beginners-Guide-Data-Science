Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless pork loin, cubed
8 ounces fried pork skins
2 pig's feet
1 tablespoon salt
2 (15 ounce) cans white hominy, drained
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tablespoons chopped onion
4 dried hot red chile pepper pods, seeded and diced

Directions:
Place meat, pork rinds, and pork shanks in a large kettle and add about 5 quarts of water or enough to cover meat. Add approximately 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about 1 1/2 hours.
Remove excess grease and set aside. Reserve liquid.
Wash the posole very carefully until the water is clear so as to remove lime from kernels. Put in large kettle and cover with water. Boil until posole has popped.
Mix meat, posole, rind, and shanks or pigs' feet. Add oregano, garlic, onion, and chile pods. Let simmer for about 1/2 hour.

Description: 
This Mexican pork stew can be served without the pork rinds and pigs' feet, if desired, but it will not be authentic. Posole may be served as a main dish with tortillas or crackers. Posole can be found in the meat section if it is available in your area. If not available, hominy can be substituted in the same quantities but no rinsing or pre-cooking is needed. Add red chili sauce and leave the seeds in the peppers for a hotter/spicier taste. You can also add one can of tomatoes to enhance the flavor of the stew.
