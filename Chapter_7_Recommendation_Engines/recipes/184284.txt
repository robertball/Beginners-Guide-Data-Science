Ingredients:
1/2 pound Chinese wheat noodles or whole-wheat spaghetti
1/3 cup Newman's Own Lighten Up Low Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing
1/4 cup Thai-style sweet chili sauce
3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 medium orange, zested and juiced
1 teaspoon hot chili oil, or to taste (sriracha may be substituted)
2 cups shredded chicken
2 cups broccoli coleslaw mix
1 hothouse (seedless) cucumber, cut in 1/2-inch dice
1 small red bell pepper, cut in 1/4-inch dice
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper
Garnish:
Crisp, curly lettuce leaves
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Directions:
Bring 4-quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat; add pasta and cook until al dente stage is reached. Drain pasta; rinse with cold water and return to pan.
Place salad dressing, chili sauce, peanut butter, orange juice and zest in a small bowl; whisk to combine. Stir in 1 teaspoon chili oil. Taste. If more heat is desired, add additional chili oil, a teaspoon at a time, until seasoned to taste - exercise caution as chili oil is very hot.
Pour sauce over noodles. Add chicken, broccoli slaw, cucumbers, bell pepper, and 1/2 cup cilantro; toss to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste. Line a platter with lettuce leaves, top with noodles and garnish with reserved 2 tablespoons cilantro and chopped peanuts. Serve at room temperature.
