Ingredients:
2 lbs red bliss potatoes
2 T unsalted butter
2 T milk
salt
celery salt
water

Directions:
Cut the potatoes into quarters.  Place in a pot and pour water in until the potatoes are covered.
Boil until a fork slides easily into the potatoes.
Drain the water and mash the potatoes.  Add the butter and milk.  Adjust the measurements if needed; if it's dry add more milk and if it's not creamy enough add more butter.
Continue to mash, adding the seasonings to taste.  Stop mashing when there are no clumps of potato left and everything is thoroughly blended.
