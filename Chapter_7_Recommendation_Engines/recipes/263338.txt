Description: 
An easy vegetarian curry which can be tweaked to suit your personal tastes regarding spice and heat. I used green peppers, but you can experiment with other types of vegetables like cauliflower, red pepper, okra, etc., as desired! Serve with basmati rice and sprinkle with fresh cilantro if you like.
