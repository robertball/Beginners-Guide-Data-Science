Ingredients:
1 3-oz package of Cream Cheese
1 Egg Yolk
1 ¼ C. Flour
½ C. Quick-Cooking Rolled Oats
¼ Cup Packed Brown Sugar
1 T Baking Powder
1 t Ground Cinnamon
¼ t salt
1 beaten egg
¾ C. Milk
3 T cooking oil
½ cup dried fruit bits
1 egg white
1 T water
3 T  sugar

Directions:
In small mixer bowl beat together cream cheese and egg yolk; set aside. Line or grease 10 muffin cups. Set Aside. In a medium bowl combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Make a well in center, in a small mixing bowl combine the whole egg, milk, and oil.  Add all at once to flour mixture. Stir until just moistened (batter should be lumpy!) Gently fold in the fruit bits, spoon half the batter into prepared muffin cups. Spoon about ½ tablespoon of the cream cheese  mixture into each cup, and fill up the cups with remaining batter. Fill cups to about ¾ way full. Bake 15-18 minutes at 400 degrees until golden. Remove from pans, cool slightly. In a clean small mixing bowl beat together egg white and water with a fork until well blended. Brush mixture over the tops of the muffins and sprinkle with sugar.

Description: 
Deliciously hearty and moist muffins with dots of whatever fruit you choose! The suprise is some cream cheese filling in the center.
This is a recipe from my Grandmother that she shared with me on a lovely weekend we spent together. She said the recipe was origonally from their local newspaper, the Marysville Advocate- which is a tiny little blip on the map, in Kansas.
