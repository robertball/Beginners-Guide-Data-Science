Ingredients:
3 avocados - peeled, pitted and diced
1/2 onion, minced
2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 clove garlic, pressed
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons lime juice
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt and black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak

Directions:
Place the avocados, onion, tomato, garlic, and cilantro into a mixing bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon cumin, 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, lime juice, and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir gently until evenly combined; set aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Combine the kosher salt, 2 tablespoons cumin, 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, ground black pepper, coriander, chili powder, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside.
Dry the flank steak with paper towels, and rub the spice mixture onto both sides. Cook on the preheated grill until the flank steak starts to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove the steak from the grill, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest 5 minutes before slicing against the grain. Arrange onto a platter, and top with salsa to serve.

A spicy chili-flavored rub is used to add depth and complexity to grilled flank steak. Top with cool and creamy avocado salsa, roll up in a warm corn tortilla, and you have a wonderful summer meal. Serve with a leafy green salad and cilantro-lime rice to round out the menu.
