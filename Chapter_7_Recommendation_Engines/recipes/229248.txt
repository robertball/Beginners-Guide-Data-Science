Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup tomato-vegetable juice cocktail
2 tablespoons sherry wine (optional)
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
4 potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (8 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1 cup diced carrots
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushroom pieces and stems, drained
1 teaspoon dried celery flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat with onion and garlic until the meat is completely browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Stir cream of mushroom soup, vegetable broth, vegetable juice cocktail, sherry, and Worcestershire sauce together in a slow cooker. Add beef mixture; stir in potatoes, corn, peas, carrots, mushroom pieces, celery flakes, salt, black pepper, marjoram, and thyme. Set cooker to Low, cover, and cook until vegetables are tender and sauce has thickened, about 8 hours. If preferred, set cooker on High and cook 4 hours.

Description: 
Incorporating ideas from other reviewers, I adapted the skillet version to a slow cooker version when we needed a meal to be ready when we got home. We loved this over hot biscuits. The ultimate comfort food with veggies included! Don't let the spices scare you and don't skimp on them. Their presence makes this a totally delicious meal!
