Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 cup milk
2 tsp. baking powder
2 tsp. salt
2 quarts of vegetable oil for deep frying

Directions:
Sift together flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, butter and blend thoroughly.
Turn onto a floured surface and knead until a smooth dough is formed, about 5 minutes. Add flour as needed so dough does not stick to surface.
Roll dough very thin and cut into long strips, about 6" x 2-1/2" Make a lengthwise cut in the center of each strip.
Heat oil in a cast iron skillet to 375°F - 400°F. Carefully place a few strips of dough at a time in oil and fry until golden brown on each side. Remove and place on paper towels to soak up excess oil.
Serve immediately with fresh watermelon slices.
