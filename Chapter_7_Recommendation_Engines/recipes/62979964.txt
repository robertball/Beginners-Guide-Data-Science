Ingredients:
3 cups flour
½ teaspoon salt
1 ¼ cups shortening
1 egg beaten
2 teaspoons vinegar
2 Tablespoons ice water

Directions:
Measure flour and salt into your food processor bowl and pulse. Add chunks of shortening& pulse a few times to make a pea sized meal .Do not overwork the dough.
Beat together the egg, vinegar and ice water and chill briefly. Pour liquid ingredients into dry ingredients. Pulse until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Do not overwork the dough. Divide the dough in half. Put each half in a quart or gallon ziplock bag and roll out to fill the bag. Seal the bag and store in the refrigerator or freezer until ready for use. Pull the suckers out and roll on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Each recipe makes two nine inch singles or a double crust pie.
