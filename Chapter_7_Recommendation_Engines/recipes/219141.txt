Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust pastry
1 cup golden syrup
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup bread crumbs

2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the pie crust pastry evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate.
Mix the syrup, cream, bread crumbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a bowl; pour into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
Any Harry Potter fan knows what this is. I finally procured the recipe from an British friend of mine. I know I can now find 'Lyle's Golden Syrup' in the grocery store along with the pancake syrups. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
