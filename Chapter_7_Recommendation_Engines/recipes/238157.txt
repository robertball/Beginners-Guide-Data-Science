Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as desired
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup blueberries
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Process oats in a blender or food processor until the consistency of flour. Combine ground oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
Whisk eggs, honey, almond milk, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir oat mixture into egg mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in blueberries.
Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I'm trying to eat less flour, but I also insist that my meals be tasty. After trying dozens of other people's recipes, I took ideas from all of them to create this. It's probably the most delicious thing I've ever had! By substituting out the eggs, it's easy to turn this into a vegan meal as well. Try a bite before topping with syrup, it's decadently yummy as-is! I make 'silver dollar' pancakes to take as snacks to potlucks.
