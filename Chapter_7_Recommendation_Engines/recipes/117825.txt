Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound broiler-fryer chicken
1 1/2 teaspoons salt-free lemon-pepper seasoning
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 medium lemon, halved
2 fresh rosemary sprigs

Directions:
Loosen skin around chicken breast, leg and thigh. Combine the seasonings; rub half under skin. Cut half of the lemon into quarters and place in the cavity along with rosemary sprigs. Skewer openings; tie drumsticks together with kitchen string.
Place chicken breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Squeeze the remaining lemon over chicken; rub with remaining spice mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until chicken juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F (cover loosely with foil if browning too quickly). Cover and let stand for 15 minutes. Remove and discard skin, and discard lemon and herbs from cavity before carving.
