Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 pounds boneless, skinless turkey breast, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 cups chopped onions
1/2 tablespoon garlic, minced
3 (4 ounce) cans diced green chiles
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 (25 ounce) containers white hominy, drained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, drained
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute turkey, onions, and garlic in the butter until turkey is no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
While turkey is cooking, combine chile peppers, cumin, oregano, salt, and cayenne in a slow cooker set to Low. Stir in hominy and 1 can black-eyed peas. Mash the other can of black-eyed peas with a fork and stir into the slow cooker along with the chicken broth. Stir in sauteed turkey and onions.
Cook on Low until flavors combine, about 4 hours. Add cilantro just before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of a posole dish we used to serve at a Mexican restaurant I worked at. It is requested on a fairly regular basis here at the homestead and never disappoints!
