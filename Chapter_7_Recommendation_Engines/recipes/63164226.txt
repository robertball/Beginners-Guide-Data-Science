Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons black, brown, or yellow mustard seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 small onion, minced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 Fresno chile or red jalapeño, cut into thin rings, seeded if desired
2 cups cups long-grain white rice
4 2x1-inch strips lemon peel (yellow part only) plus 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 cup roasted cashews

Directions:
Heat oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and turmeric and cook, shaking pan, until mustard seeds pop, 1–2 minutes. Add onion, garlic, and chile and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 7 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat. Add lemon peel, salt, and 3 cups water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 20–25 minutes.
Stir in lemon juice. Cover and let stand off heat for 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and stir in cashews.
