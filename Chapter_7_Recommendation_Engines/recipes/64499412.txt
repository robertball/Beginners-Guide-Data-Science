Ingredients:
Salt
7 ounces uncooked pearl barley, (equivalent to about 3 cups cooked barley)
3  sun-dried tomatoes
2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
3 ounces olives, pitted and halved
5 ounces tomatoes, halved or quartered
1 cucumber, diced
2 Tbsp capers
Fresh thyme
Fresh mint
Fresh basil
Extra-virgin olive oil (if needed).

Directions:
Over medium heat, bring a pot of water to a boil. When the water boils, add some salt and the uncooked barley. Simmer on low-medium heat for 20 minutes or until tender. When the barley is cooked, rinse with cold water under the faucet and drain well. Set aside.
Place the sun-dried tomatoes and extra-virgin olive oil in a blender and cream mixture.
In a small bowl, soak the capers in water for about 10 minutes. Drain, then squeeze the capers lightly to get rid of excess liquid. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix the barley, sun-dried tomato cream.
Add the olives, tomatoes, cucumber, capers, thyme, mint and basil. Add more extra-virgin olive oil if salad is too thick.

Description: 
The Mediterranean diet of southern Italy, Greece, Spain and Morocco is appreciated for its nutritional aspects. It is primarily based on high consumption of olive oil, vegetables, unrefined cereals, legumes, fish and minimal consumption of meat. This is great as a side dish or a light lunch. It can also be made with lentils.
