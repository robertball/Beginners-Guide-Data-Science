Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 ounces reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, cubed
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 25 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Blend cauliflower, yogurt, chicken broth, and olive oil in a blender until smooth; pour cauliflower mixture into a saucepan over medium heat. Stir Cheddar cheese, nutritional yeast, mustard powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg into cauliflower mixture; cook and stir until cheese sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni; toss to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese and panko crumbs together in a bowl; sprinkle over macaroni. Bake until Parmesan cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Cauliflower and nutritional yeast add protein and vitamins while blending the cauliflower, Greek yogurt, low-fat sharp Cheddar, and chicken stock create a creamy texture. The sharp Cheddar plus spices maintain a nice cheesy taste. It's better than you might think.
