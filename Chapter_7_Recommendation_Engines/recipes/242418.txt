Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup quinoa
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
1  onion, chopped
1  green bell pepper, chopped
1  jalapeno pepper, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 ½ cups salsa
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 teaspoons garlic salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
¼ cup sour cream (optional)
¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a separate large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix quinoa, chicken, black beans, salsa, tomato paste, garlic salt, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, and oregano into onion mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until casserole is heated through and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Top casserole with sour cream and Cheddar cheese.
