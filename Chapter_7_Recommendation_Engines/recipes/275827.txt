Ingredients:
aluminum foil
cooking spray
1 kohlrabi bulb, peeled and diced
1/2 onion, sliced
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pound frozen okra, thawed
4 tablespoons cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup sunflower seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Combine kohlrabi, onion, paprika, and garlic powder in a bowl; mix well. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and stir to combine.
Place okra into a separate bowl and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil; mix well. Toss in cornmeal, salt, and pepper.
Spread okra mixture onto on one half of the prepared baking sheet and kohlrabi-onion mixture onto the other half.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Stir okra and kohlrabi mixtures, keeping them on separate sides of the baking sheet. Bake until okra is crispy and kohlrabi is brown and tender, 20 to 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven and mix okra and kohlrabi together. Mix in sunflower seeds.
