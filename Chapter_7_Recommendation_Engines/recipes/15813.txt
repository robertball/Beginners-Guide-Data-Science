Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can ranch-style beans
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup chopped onion
6 thick slices bacon, cooked and cubed

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium high heat, combine the beans, tomato sauce, chicken stock and onions. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
Using a potato masher, carefully mash some of the beans in the soup to make it a little thicker, if desired. Add the bacon and serve.

Description: 
This is similar to many canned versions of a bean and bacon soup, only using some fresh ingredients. It goes well with freshly baked corn bread.
