Description: 
This is one of my first original recipes I created (made several years ago, if other recipes existed I was not aware of them), and has been a hit among family and friends so I wanted to share it with the public. I typically try to serve it warm, but room temperature is good as well. Many say it tastes similar to traditional baklava but is much easier to make.
