Description: 
My husband actually calls these 'mini egg white pizzas,' because they puff up a lot in the oven, then deflate while cooling--and end up looking like little pizzas! No matter what you call them, they taste pretty good, and make for an easy grab-and-go snack! Extras may be frozen, and reheated before serving.
