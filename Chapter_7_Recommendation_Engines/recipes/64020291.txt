Ingredients:
5 pounds carrots
4 leeks
4 tablespoons butter
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel carrots and cut into thin slices. Trim leeks; discard tough greens. Cut the leeks into quarters lengthwise and then cut quarters crosswise into thin slices. Rinse leeks well and drain. Cook carrots in a little water over medium-high heat until tender, about 15 minutes. While carrots are cooking, melt butter in a large pot and add leeks; saute until leeks are soft, about 10 minutes. Add carrots, salt, and pepper.  Cook until heated through and serve.
