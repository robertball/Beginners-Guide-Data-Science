Ingredients:
1 large bag (32 oz) frozen chopped broccoli
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
6 1/2 cups water
2 lb. sharp cheddar cheese
10 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the broccoli, celery, onion, ham and water in a crockpot. Cook on low for 6-8 hours.
Add american cheese, a few slices at a time.  Stir well to incorporate.
Warm milk in the microwave.  In a saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a whisk, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Add to soup.  Mix thoroughly. Serve immediately.
