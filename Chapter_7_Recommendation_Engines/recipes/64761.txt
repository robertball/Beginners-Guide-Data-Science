Description: 
For Blackened fish or chicken (great on any type of fish, especially on denser types of fish). The nice thing about this recipe is that the dish doesn't taste burnt even though you can get a nice blackened look. The sugar and the thyme caramelize and give it a wonderful flavor. All my friends love it.
