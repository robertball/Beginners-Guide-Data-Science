Ingredients:
For the sauce:
1 cup thick cream or sour cream
1 cup tomato pure
1/4 small onion, minced
1 medium garlic clove minced
1 stick butter
1/4 cup of shimp stock
1 chipotles in adobo (1 1/2 chiles if you like spice)
For the tortas:
4 birotes or French style baguettes
1/3 lb pound thick cream or sour cream
2 lb medium-size shrimp
Salt and pepper to taste
1/3 stick butter
1/2 stick of celery
Garnish:
red onion in julienne
juice of 1 key lime
1 avocado

Directions:
Boil the shrimp in water with celery and pepper. When cooked, drain and set aside, reserving the stock. Sautee the shrimp in butter with a dash of shrimp stock.
In a small bowl, cover the onion in julienne with the lime juice. Reserve for garnish.
In the blender, add cream, chipotles, and tomato paste and blend well. Heat the butter in a sauce pan and add the minced onion and garlic. When the onion is transparent, add the blended cream and chipotles and cook, stirring, until thick.
Open a bollilo or baguette and spread the inner surface with cream. Place some of the cooked shrimp inside it and drench in the sauce. Garnish with onion and avocado. Makes 4 sandwiches.
