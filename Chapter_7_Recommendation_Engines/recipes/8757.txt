Ingredients:
¼ cup milk
¼ cup bread crumbs
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 tablespoons butter
½ cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (4 ounce) jar sliced pimento peppers, drained
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
¼ cup chopped fresh basil
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place milk and breadcrumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dip chicken in the milk, then coat with breadcrumbs. In a skillet over medium heat, fry chicken in butter or margarine, on both sides, until the juices run clear. Remove from skillet and keep warm.
Add the broth to the skillet; bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir to loosen browned bits from pan. Stir in the cream and pimentos; boil and stir for one minute. Reduce heat; add the Parmesan cheese, basil and black pepper. Simmer and stir until heated through. To serve, pour the sauce over the chicken.
