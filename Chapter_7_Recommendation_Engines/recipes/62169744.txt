Ingredients:
1½ cups whole milk
1 cup sugar
¼ cup ghee
3 tablespoons sooji rava (semolina)
½ teaspoon cardamom (elaichi) powder
¼ cup cashewnuts

Directions:
Heat ghee in a heavy bottomed pan. Fry cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside.
Add the milk, sugar, and semolina to the remaining ghee in the pan. Bring to a boil and cook on low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture becomes very thick. This should take 30 – 45 minutes. Add cardamom powder and mix.
Pour the mithai into a greased rimmed plate. Chop the cashewnuts and sprinkle on top. Score the mithai into squares and cut when cooled. Or if you are in a hurry, scoop out with a spoon and serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a very easy, but a bit time consuming sweet. It is like sooji halwa except that the liquid is milk (paalu). My children love this sweet.
