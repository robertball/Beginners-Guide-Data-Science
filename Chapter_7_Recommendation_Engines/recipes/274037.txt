Ingredients:
1 pound beef tri-tip steak, cut into bite-size pieces
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained
1 red bell pepper, cubed
1 zucchini, sliced
1/2 red onion, chopped
16 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini)
3 thick slices rosemary peasant-style bread, cubed
8 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon fresh basil, cut into strips

Directions:
Preheat a charcoal grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread beef, artichoke hearts, bell pepper, zucchini, onion, mozzarella, and bread onto skewers, placing cheese and bread close together towards the ends.
Mix vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl and drizzle over kabobs.
Grill kabobs, turning frequently, until vegetables are crisp-tender and beef is firm and hot in the center, about 10 minutes.
Sprinkle fresh basil on top of the kabobs.
