Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and scored
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup milk
2 1/2 cups processed cheese (such as VelveetaÂ®), diced

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cook the sprouts for 10 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook the mixture until it turns a slight tan color, about 1 minute; whisk in the milk. Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the processed cheese until the cheese has melted and the sauce is thick and smooth. Transfer the Brussels sprouts into the sauce, stirring to coat.

Description: 
This is the ONLY way I can get my husband and kids to eat Brussels sprouts, and everybody that tries this dish LOVES it! Mouth-watering creamy cheesy sauce slathered over Brussels sprouts so soft your teeth slide through them. You may need to double this recipe to have enough! I always make the sauce while sprouts are cooking, to save time and have it all ready at about the same time.
