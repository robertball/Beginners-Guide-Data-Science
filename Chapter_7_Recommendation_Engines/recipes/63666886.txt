Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 quart cold chicken stock
1/3 cup heavy cream
salt and ground white pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour until fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes.
Gradually whisk in cold stock. Reduce heat to low. Bring gravy to a simmer, and cook and stir until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir in heavy cream, and season with salt, white pepper, and cayenne pepper.
