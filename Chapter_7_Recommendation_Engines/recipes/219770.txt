Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 tablespoon bacon drippings
2 cups diced onion (1/2-inch dice)
2 cups diced potato (1/2-inch dice)
2 cups diced turnip (1/2-inch dice)
4 sprigs fresh thyme
water, to cover
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup torn kale leaves
1 cup heavy cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until the fat begins to render, about 4 minutes; remove from heat, and drain most of the rendered bacon drippings, reserving about 1 tablespoon in the skillet.
Return the pan with the bacon and reserved drippings to medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the bacon and fat until translucent, about 4 minutes more. Stir the potato and turnip into the bacon mixture; cook and stir until the potato and turnip pieces are warmed, about 2 minutes.
Add the thyme to the saucepan with enough water to cover the vegetable mixture; bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a brisk simmer until the potato and turnip are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat butter in a small skillet. Cook and stir the kale leaves until they wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the kale and the cream into the simmering soup; allow to simmer together another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove thyme sprigs before serving.

Description: 
Creamy and savory, there are NEVER leftovers when I make this dish. A great way to incorporate turnips into your diet! If soup becomes too thick, thin with  broth, water, or cream.
