Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can asparagus tips, drained
2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained and flaked
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1 cup diced firm tofu
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 clove garlic, crushed

Directions:
In a slow cooker, combine the asparagus, crabmeat, fish sauce, spinach, tofu, oregano and garlic. Fill with enough water to cover by about 2 inches. Cover, and cook on High for 45 minutes, or until you smell the aroma and the spinach has cooked down dramatically.

Description: 
The broth is wonderful, and the soup has a nice healthy flavor. This soup is an assortment of wonderfully interesting flavors that work well together. Surprisingly. I saw a similar recipe on line somewhere (not here) and I took the base and left out the exotic things (I can't identify or get) and then expounded on it.Modified from: Crabmeat and Asparagus Soup
