Description: 
This baked omelette is quick, easy and a great summer dish. Scamorza cheese is an Italian cheese similar to mozzarella, that's harder and has more flavor. You can use mozzarella or a semi-hard cheese instead. This omelette would go well with a side dish like cherry tomato and anchovy salad.
