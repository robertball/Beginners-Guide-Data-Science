Ingredients:
2 boxes (8.5 oz each) Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp cayenne (red pepper)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder (not garlic salt)
2 Tbsp onion powder (not onion salt)
3 eggs
1 - 5 oz can evaporated milk (not condensed milk)
1 - 14.75 oz can cream style corn

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the corn muffin mix, black pepper, cayenne, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix together until blended. Add eggs and milk. Mix until moistened. Add corn and mix until well blended. Let batter stand while oil heats.
Heat oil to 375 to 400 degrees. Drop batter from a teaspoonful, slightly above oil (not from up high), gently so that it is a blob, not a stream. The consistency of the batter should be like cornbread batter, not thicker, or else the hush puppies will be too dry. Fry until deep golden brown. These will brown very well. If they are not done enough, you can put them in the microwave for 30 seconds to finish them. Make the next batch a little browner. Salt lightly, if desired, and serve.

Description: 
I don't normally like hush puppies. They are generally too dry, too dense, and too bland for my taste. After tasting some in a restaurant that I actually liked, I decided to come up with a recipe of my own. This one deliberately uses stuff right out of the pantry so that it can be whipped up quickly and served fast.
