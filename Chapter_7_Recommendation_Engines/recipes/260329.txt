Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups Bruce'sÂ® Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes in Syrup, drained
2 large eggs, beaten well
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 white onion, grated
3 russet potatoes, peeled, grated
Peanut oil, for frying

Directions:
In a large bowl (using a hand beater) whip the Bruce's Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes until creamy.
Add the eggs, parsley, flour, salt, pepper and onion; stir well to combine.
Press all the excess moisture out of the grated Russet potatoes and add to sweet potato mixture. Stir ingredients to blend well.
Heat peanut oil to 375 degrees F in an electric skillet (or a heavy skillet over medium-high heat).
Pour in 1/3 cup potato mixture at a time, flattening each with the back of a wooden spoon. Fry until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
Serve with sour cream and applesauce on the side.
