Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon shortening, melted
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water
coarse salt, or to taste

Directions:
Stir yeast into 1 cup warm water in a large bowl; beat in flour, sugar, shortening, and salt to make a dough. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes.
Place dough into a greased bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and divide into 12 equal-size pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 18 to 20 inches long.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Shape each rope of dough into a pretzel on the prepared baking sheet; let pretzels rest for 5 minutes. Beat egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and brush yolk mixture over each pretzel; sprinkle each with coarse salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until pretzels are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
