Ingredients:
1 baguette, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon good-quality extra-virgin olive oil
1 pinch kosher salt
1 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons real maple syrup
1 lemon, zested
1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
2 fresh peaches
5 thin slices prosciutto, or more if needed
6 leaves basil, cut chiffonade style
2 tablespoons maple syrup, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place baguette slices on a baking sheet and brush the tops with olive oil. Sprinkle with 1 pinch kosher salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.
Meanwhile, stir together ricotta, lemon zest, maple syrup, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl. Place in the refrigerator.
Preheat a panini grill to 420 degrees F (215 degrees C).
Rinse peaches in cold water, remove pits, and slice into 1/2-inch wedges.
Place 1/2 of the prosciutto slices on one side of the preheated grill and 1/2 of the peach wedges on the other side. Close the grill and cook for 30 seconds. Carefully transfer the peach wedges to a baking sheet (peaches are delicate when sliced so make sure they don't turn too soft). Transfer proscuitto to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining peaches and prosciutto.
Chop prosciutto coarsely. Spread 1/2 teaspoon of the ricotta mixture onto each baguette slice and sprinkle generously with prosciutto. Top each baguette with 2 to 3 peach slices. Sprinkle with basil and drizzle with maple syrup.
