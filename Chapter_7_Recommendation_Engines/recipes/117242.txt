Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 pounds bay scallops
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons butter
1 (4.5 ounce) jar sliced mushrooms, drained
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 1/4 cups shredded Asiago cheese
TOPPING:
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, milk, cream, wine, mustard, salt and pepper until smooth; set aside. In a large skillet, saute scallops and onion in butter until scallops are opaque. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add milk mixture to the skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
Drain scallops. Add the scallops, mushrooms and tarragon to the sauce; heat through. Stir in Asiago cheese until melted.
Divide scallop mixture among four 10-oz. baking dishes. Combine the topping ingredients; sprinkle over scallop mixture. Broil 6 in. from the heat for 1-2 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
Since scallops will continue to release their cooked juices, drain this liquid before returning scallops to the pan so that your sauce is thicker.
