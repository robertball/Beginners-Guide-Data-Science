Ingredients:
4 trout, cleaned and head removed
salt and pepper to taste
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 medium green bell pepper, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)

Directions:
Place each trout on a piece of aluminum foil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stuff the cavity with 1 tablespoon of butter, green pepper and garlic if using.
Roll the trout tightly in the foil, forming packets.  Use some additional foil to secure each packet of fish to a metal toasting rod for use as a handle when removing fish from the coals.
Cover the fish packets in the red hot, smoldering coals of your campfire and cook until the fish is done, 7 to 10 minutes, depending on the heat of the fire.

Description: 
My dad taught me how to prepare the trout we caught fresh on camping trips when I was a kid.  I always loved the buttery flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture!
