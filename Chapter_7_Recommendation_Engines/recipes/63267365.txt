Ingredients:
30 Strawberries
30 Blueberries
1 Container of Nutella
1 Container of Whipped Cream
1 Box of Mini Graham Crackers

Directions:
Cut a small portion from the bottom of each strawberry, so that the strawberry is able to stand upright on a plate.
Using a knife, cut a circle around the stem of the strawberry, hollowing out the strawberry.
Put one tablespoon of whipped cream or Nutella (or both!) inside of each strawberry.
Place one mini graham cracker on top of the whipped cream or Nutella-filled strawberry.
Place one blueberry on top of the whipped cream or Nutella-filled strawberry.
Serve immediately. (If you are waiting to serve this dish, add the graham crackers just before serving.)
