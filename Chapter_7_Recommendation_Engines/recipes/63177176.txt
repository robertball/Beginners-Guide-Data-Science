Ingredients:
4 1/4 cups canned tomato sauce
1 cup canned diced tomatoes with green chiles
1/2 cup jarred jalapeño slices, drained and chopped
1 1/2 tbsp. chili powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
2 tsp. crushed garlic
1 3/4 cups peeled and chopped carrots
1 1/2 cups chopped onions (1 - 2 onions)
1 1/2 cups chopped portabella mushrooms
1 large red bell pepper, stem removed, seeded, chopped
1 large green bell pepper, stem removed, seeded, chopped
1 cup canned sweet corn kernels, drained
3/4 cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed
3/4 cup canned red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
Optional: salt

Directions:
In a large pot over low heat on the stove, combine tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with green chiles, jalapeños, chili powder, and cumin. Stir well.
Once mixture is hot, add garlic and carrots. Stir and continue to cook for about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large skillet to medium heat on the stove. Add onions, mushrooms, peppers, 1/2 cup water and, if you like, a few dashes of salt. Stirring occasionally, cook until veggies have just slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon to drain any excess water, transfer veggies from the skillet to the large pot. Add corn, beans, and Worcestershire sauce to the pot as well. Mix thoroughly.
Cook over low heat for about 2 hours, stirring every 20 minutes or so, until all veggies are tender.
Serve it up!
