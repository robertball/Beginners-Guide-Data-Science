1/2 teaspoon salt

8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
2 tomatoes, diced
1 cucumber, sliced
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 head lettuce, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced

Directions:
Prepare spread: mash diced avocado, mayonnaise, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper in a bowl with a fork until well blended.
Assemble wraps: spread tortillas with a layer of avocado spread.  Place diced tomatoes, cucumber slices, bell pepper strips, lettuce, and mozzarella cheese slices onto each wrap, leaving about 2 inches of space at the bottom. Fold bottoms up. Roll tortillas over vegetables firmly to enclose fillings.
