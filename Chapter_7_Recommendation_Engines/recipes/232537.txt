Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups milk
1 tablespoon vinegar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest (optional)
1 1/2 cups rice flour
1 cup cornmeal
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup blueberries
1 tablespoon raw sugar, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Stir milk and vinegar together in a small bowl; set aside to sour for 3 to 5 minutes.
Beat white sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Add eggs, egg yolk, soured milk, and lemon zest; beat until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Mix rice flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; slowly stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until just mixed. Gently fold in blueberries. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Sprinkle each muffin with raw sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
After I was diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity, I played around with various recipes so that I could not only eat food that worked with my system, but also enjoy it. I love this blueberry muffin almost as much as the original, all-purpose flour version, and the rest of my family can enjoy it too without feeling like it's a sacrifice. I generally use brown rice flour, but white rice flour may yield a fluffier muffin. I personally like the texture the cornmeal adds, but for a more traditional muffin, feel free to do all rice flour (maybe half brown, half white).
