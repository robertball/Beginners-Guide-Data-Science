2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a bread pan.
Mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and cloves in a large bowl.
Beat egg and milk together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture and stir to moisten dry ingredients evenly. Pour mixture into a bread pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
