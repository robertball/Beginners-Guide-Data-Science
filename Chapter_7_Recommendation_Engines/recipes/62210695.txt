Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces
5 teaspoons Creole Seasoning, divided
1 Chipotle pepper in adobo
1 large red onion, roughly diced
1 green bell pepper, roughly diced
1 yellow bell pepper, roughly diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small lime, juiced
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 14-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
3 cups cooked brown rice

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in large skillet (I used cast iron, but non-stick will work), add chicken and about half the Creole seasoning. Saute until just cooked. Set chicken aside, keep leavings in the pan.
Add remaining oil, onions, peppers, garlic and lime juice. Saute until the onions are just translucent.
Add stock, chipotle, remaining Creole seasoning, chicken, tomatoes and beans. Reduce heat to medium and cook uncovered until sauce thickens and reduces by about 1/3. Serve over rice.
