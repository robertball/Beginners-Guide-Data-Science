Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup butter
2 1/2 cups white sugar
5 eggs
2 teaspoons almond extract
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 cups cake flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.
Cream shortening, butter and sugar until light and fluffy (for best results use an electric mixer). This will take a while. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in almond extract.
Combine baking powder and flour. Stir into creamed mixture alternately with the milk, starting and ending with flour. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
