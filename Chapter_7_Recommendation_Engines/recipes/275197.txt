Description: 
I made this one morning before work and when I came home and served it, all I had were slack-jawed full-bellied friends. Served on fresh buns, with a side salad made of spinach, strawberries, and red onions with a poppy seed dressing. All I can say is yum! But be warned, you will be full.
