Ingredients:
1 tablespoon garlic powder, or to taste
1-1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
1-1/2 teaspoons paprika
3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin
1-1/2 cups oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.
Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
