Ingredients:
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons fresh rosemary
4 pork chops
2 carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 leeks, chopped
1 large zucchini, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
5 small tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1 cup vegetable broth
1 cinnamon stick
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/3 cup olive oil
4 fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Grind together salt, garlic powder and rosemary; rub onto chop. In a skillet, lightly brown in as little oil as possible; set aside.
Saute carrots, onion, green pepper, leeks, zucchini and garlic.  Stir very little until they begin to caramelize or burn slightly.  Layer half the vegetable mixture, including the tomatoes, in the bottom of a dutch oven or large saucepan.  Arrange the chops on top and then pour the rest of the vegetable mixture on top.
Heat the vegetable stock in the saute pan and stir to loosen bits of food on the bottom.  Pour over the vegetable and pork chops.
Add cinnamon stick, allspice, olive oil and basil.  Simmer for 20 minutes.
