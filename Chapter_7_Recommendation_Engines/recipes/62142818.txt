Ingredients:
1 Boston Butt
1 tbsp liquid smoke
1/2 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce
1 tbsp of garlic powder
1 tbsp celery salt
2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Rub the celery salt, black pepper, and the garlic powder on all sides of the roast, and place it in the slow cooker.
Pour the BBQ sauce and liquid smoke on top of the roast.
Put a lid on it and turn the cooker to low for 8 hours, or high for 4 hours.( 8 hours is best )
Afterwhich you remove the roast and shred using two forks.
Return it to the crock pot and add more BBQ sauce if you like.
Cook another 30 minutes on high.
If you like a little browning like me, just pop it in the oven and broil it a bit, instead.
