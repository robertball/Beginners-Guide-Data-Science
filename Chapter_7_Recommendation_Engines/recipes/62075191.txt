Ingredients:
4 Chicken Breasts
1 small can chipotle chilies in Adobo
1 small onion chopped
2 cloves of garlic
2 limes
1 teaspoon ground cumin (Optional)
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano (Optional)
1 teaspoon salt or to taste
3 Tablespoon Olive Oil
1/8 cup of water
1 bunch of cilantro

Directions:
Combine onion, garlic, olive oil, salt, juice of one lime, and 1 to 5 chipotle chiles w/sauce from can and spices if using in food processor or blender and process till smooth. If marinade is too thick you can add water till you have a nice consistency.  Also put aside a small amount to use as additional salsa when done.  It will be quite hot so watch out! Butterfly chicken breasts by slicing up the middle but not all the way through so that they are still attached and can be opened on grill.  This allows them to cook quicker and allows marinade to penetrate easier. Combine in a storage bag with marinade and let sit for 1/2 hour up to one hour.
Make sure grill is preheated.  Remove chicken from marinade and discard marinade.  Place chicken breasts open on grill and grill each side for about 8 minutes careful not to overcook.  Chop cilantro while chicken is grilling.  Remove chicken from grill and squeeze fresh lime juice and garnish with chopped cilantro.  Serve with remaining salsa.
