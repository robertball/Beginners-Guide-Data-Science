Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 can refrigerated pizza dough
1 cup chunky salsa
1-2 chipolte peppers in sauce
1 pound ground chuck
1 package taco seasoning
2/3 cup water
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Chop chipoltes finely, then add to salsa.
Brown meat over medium heat, remove any water or grease, then add seasoning and 2/3 c water.
Cook this until the meat is coated and the sauce is almost completely gone.
Spray a large cooking sheet and spread dough out to about 15"x10".
Spread salsa mixture over dough.
Sprinkle about 1/2-3/4 cup of cheese over salsa.
Spoon meat mixture over cheese.
Top with remaining cheese.
Bake in oven 13-15 minutes.
(The type of salsa--hot, medium or mild and the amount of chipoltes used makes the difference of how spicy this pizza comes out!)
