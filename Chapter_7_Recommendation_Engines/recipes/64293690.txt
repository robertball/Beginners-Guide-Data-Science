Ingredients:
2 ½ lbs halibut fillet
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tbsp sweet chili sauce
1 ½ cups wasabi - chopped roughly by hand or in a food processor  wasabi peas are available packaged or bulk - wasabi cashew are excellent as well

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F.
Mix the mayonnaise and the sweet chili sauce together in a small bowl. Put the halibut pieces, evenly spaced, on to a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Spread mayonnaise mixture evenly on to the top of each piece of halibut. Press wasabi peas firmly into the mayonnaise and sweet chili coating on the halibut.
Bake in 400°F for about 15-20 minutes, until halibut starts to flake and peas start to brown slightly.
Serve right away
Halibut will continue to cook a bit after it has been taken out of the oven, so be sure to take it out just when it’s starting to look opaque and flaky. The mayonnaise topping on this fish definitely helps retain the moisture, but accurate timing is still critical. Make sure your table is set, and the rest of the meal is ready to go. The fish should come right out of the oven and on to the plates.

This recipe was given to me by a friend who raved about its unique combination of ingredients that results in a wonderfully flavoured dish that is not spicy!  Kids like this. Salmon may be substituted for the halibut.
