Ingredients:
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1 tablespoon oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 1/2 cups Swanson® Chicken Broth
1/2 cup farro, rinsed
4 cups cauliflower florets
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Toast the almonds in a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Remove the almonds from the skillet and set aside.
Heat the oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and garam masala and cook for 2 minutes or until the onion is tender-crisp, stirring occasionally.
Stir the broth and farro in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for 10 minutes. Stir the cauliflower and chickpeas in the skillet. Cover and cook for 5-10 minutes or until the farro is just tender and the cauliflower is tender-crisp.
Stir in the orange zest and season to taste. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and the parsley.
