Ingredients:
1/3 cup shortening
1 egg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup milk
TOPPING:
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat shortening and egg. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. Stir into egg mixture alternately with milk (batter will be stiff). Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups about two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until muffins test done. For topping combine sugar and cinnamon. When puffs are removed from the oven, immediately roll each in butter and then into cinnamon-sugar. Serve hot.
