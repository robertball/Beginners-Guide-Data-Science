Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups ground pecans
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup white sugar
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Stir together ground nuts, cinnamon, and sugar.  Mix in melted butter.
Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch, deep-dish style, pie pan.  Chill the unbaked crust in the refrigerator for about 30 to 45 minutes.
Place pie crust on a cookie sheet, and position on the middle rack of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.  WATCH it carefully, as nut crusts burn easily; they DON'T have to turn black to taste burnt!   Cool completely before filling.
