Ingredients:
2 small skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
8 ounces tikka masala sauce
2 large pieces of naan bread
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1 cup freshly grated Irish white Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Dust chicken with cayenne until there is a light coating on both pieces.
Heat oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces in the hot pan until slightly charred and no longer pink in the centers, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Ladle tikka sauce evenly over both pieces of naan. Place chicken, onion, and cilantro evenly onto each pizza and top each with white Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and toasted, about 10 minutes, checking often to prevent burning. Serve.

Description: 
Although I believe you should make everything from scratch, this may be an excuse to be lazy. This is a quick way to eat Indian food and it's presented in an exciting fusion-cuisine sort of way, which I just love.
