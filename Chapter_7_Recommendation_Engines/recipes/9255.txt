Ingredients:
4 cups coconut milk
6 tablespoons white sugar
8 egg yolks
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
8 tablespoons dark rum
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Combine the coconut milk and the sugar in a saucepan and scald over medium heat.
Beat the egg yolks with the vanilla. Beat in 1/2 cup of the scalded mixture into the egg yolks. Then whisk all the egg yolk mixture into the scalded mixture. Stirring mixture constantly, cook over low heat until mixture reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. DO NOT BOIL.
Strain the eggnog into a bowl. Stir in the rum and let cool to room temperature. Place plastic wrap on the surface and refrigerate until well chilled. Once chilled serve with nutmeg sprinkled on top.
