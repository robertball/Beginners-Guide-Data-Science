Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
Minced zest of 1 lemon
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tbsp minced garlic
2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper
8 chicken drumsticks

Directions:
Combine oil, zest, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, parsley, salt, black pepper, and pepper flakes.
Reserve 2 tbsp of the marinade, toss drumsticks with remaining marinade to coat, and let stand 30 minutes.
Preheat grill to medium and brush grate with olive oil.
Remove drumsticks from marinade and reserve for basting.  Grill drumsticks, covered, for 2 minutes.  Flip and brush with marinade; grill 2 minutes more.  Continue flipping and basting every 2 minutes until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 175, about 10 minutes more.
Transfer drumsticks to a bowl, toss with reserved 2 tbsp of marinade, and let rest 3-4 minutes.
