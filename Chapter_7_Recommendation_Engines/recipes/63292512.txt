Ingredients:
4 medium size red potatoes (peeled and cubed)
1/4 c. chopped onion
salt & pepper (to your liking)
sprinkle of garlic powder
1/8 tsp.thyme leaves
1/8 tsp. dill weed
1/2 Tbsp. minced dry onion
1/2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 Tbsp. butter
Pam cooking spray
Tin Foil (2 pieces per pack;double wrapped)

Directions:
TIP: Heat grill to medium heat (I use a charcoal grill, once coals are red and very hot I close all bottom vents and completely cover the grill for 3 minutes before placing potato packs on) Once potato packs are on, I barely prop the lid to let in a little air flow. I turn the potato packs every ten minutes for 50 minutes.
Peel your potatoes and cut into cubes. Place cut cubes into mixing bowl. Add chopped onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, thyme, dill, minced onion, and olive oil. Toss well.
Spray tin foil with Pam cooking spray and place about half of your seasoned cubed potatoes onto foil. Dot with 1/2 Tbsp. butter. Wrap foil around potatoes. Use second piece of tin foil to prevent burning and this also helps carmelize the onions to a perfect golden brown color. Repeat for second half of seasoned potatoes.
Place potato packs on 'medium' hot grill, in center. (Follow directions above to have the perfect charcoal grill temperature) Turn packs every 10 minutes to prevent burning. Packets should be done after 50 minutes.
