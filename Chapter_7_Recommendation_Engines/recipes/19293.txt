Ingredients:
1  skinless, boneless chicken breast half
1  onion, chopped
½ cup cubed Cheddar cheese
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
3  eggs
1 cup water
1  egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Lightly grease a large skillet and cook chicken until no longer pink; remove and reserve.
In a food processor, add onion to puree, then add cheese to puree. Add chicken and puree a final time.
In a large bowl, add flour and make a well in the center. Add eggs and mix well; add water and adjust with flour and water as needed. Dough should be elastic, but not sticky.
In a small bowl, beat 1 egg and add one tablespoon of water. On a floured surface, roll out dough until it is 1/4 inch thick or almost paper thin. Cut out 2 inch circles and brush with egg and water mixture. Place 1 teaspoon of stuffing in the middle of the circle and fold over. Seal the half moon by crimping the edge.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add half moons and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until al dente; drain and serve.
