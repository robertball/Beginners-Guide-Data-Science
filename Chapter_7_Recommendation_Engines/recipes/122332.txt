Ingredients:
5 pounds boneless fully cooked ham
1/4 cup honey, warmed
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup prepared horseradish
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Cut ham into 1/4-in. slices and tie with kitchen string. Place ham on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Combine honey and cloves; drizzle over ham. Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F and ham is heated through, basting often with drippings.
Meanwhile, combine the brown sugar, horseradish and lemon juice. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Baste ham with brown sugar sauce, allowing sauce to drip down between the slices. Bake, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes.

Description: 
When my husband and I first tasted this delicious ham, we were surprised to learn that the sauce included horseradish. That secret ingredient definitely is the key to its tangy taste. I serve it for Easter and Christmas.
