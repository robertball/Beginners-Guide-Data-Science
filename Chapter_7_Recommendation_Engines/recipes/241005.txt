Ingredients:
Vinaigrette:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Salad:
7 ounces shelled edamame
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can lima beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1/4 cup shredded fresh basil
4 ounces feta cheese
10 cherry tomatoes, halved, or more to taste
1 pinch sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine olive oil, rice vinegar, sherry vinegar, mustard, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a jar. Place a lid on the jar and shake until dressing is well-combined. Let sit at room temperature until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
Place edamame in a saucepan and cover with water; cook over medium-high heat until water just begins to boil and edamame is tender yet still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Stir black beans, lima beans, edamame, onion, basil, feta cheese, and tomatoes together in a large bowl. Pour dressing over the top and toss to coat. Season with sea salt and black pepper and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
My family of 4 goes through a double batch of this salad and vinaigrette in 2 days. We love it! You can use kidney, garbanzo, or pinto beans in place of lima beans, if desired. You can use pear or grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, if desired.
