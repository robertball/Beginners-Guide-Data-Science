Ingredients:
coarse-grain brown mustard as desired
8 slices country style French Bread
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1 pound thinly sliced roast turkey
8 slices tomato
8 slices Swiss cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Place 4 slices of the bread into the skillet with the butter side down and mustard side up. On each slice of bread, layer 1/4 of the sliced turkey, then 2 slices of tomato, and top with 2 slices of Swiss cheese. Place remaining slices of bread over the top with the butter side up. When the bottoms of the sandwiches are golden brown, flip over, and cook until golden on the other side.
