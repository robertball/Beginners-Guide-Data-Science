Ingredients:
2 cups butter flavored shortening
1 1/3 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
5 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. When cookies have cooled, turn them over and look at the bottom to see the "brown rim".
