3 gold potatoes
3 sweet potatoes

Directions:
Peel and chop the potatoes.  Place in a stock pot and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and cook until soft, about 12 minutes.  Drain.
While potatoes are cooking, heat oil over medium heat in a small skillet.  Add garlic and saute until light brown, about 3 minutes.
Mash potatoes with a mixer or potato ricer.
Add oil and garlic mixture and spices.  Mix until blended.

Description: 
I was tired of how sweet potato dishes tended to be add sugar, and thus be far, far too sweet.  This dish keeps the natural sweetness of the potatoes and adds intriguing depth and heat with Moroccan spices.
