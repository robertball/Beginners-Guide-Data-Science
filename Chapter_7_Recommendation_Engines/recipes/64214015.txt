Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 (20 ounce) package ground turkey
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2 Tbsp grated onion
2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp sage
1/2 to 1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1 pinch of red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with the olive oil, and place it in the oven while preheating.
In a medium bowl, mix together the spices and bread crumbs.  Add the egg and mix well.  Add the ground turkey and mix using your hands. Using an ice cream scoop if possible, form the meat into golf ball sized meatballs. Place about 1 inch apart in the hot baking dish. Press down to flatten the bottom just slightly.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then turn them over, and continue baking for about 5 more minutes, or until somewhat crispy on the outside. Serve with pasta and sauce or however you'd like.
