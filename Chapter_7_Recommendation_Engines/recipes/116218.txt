Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Dash pepper
1 pound lump crabmeat, cartilage removed
4 (1 inch thick) slices French bread, crust removed
RED PEPPER SAUCE:
1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons minced shallots
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 tablespoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
Lemon wedges

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first seven ingredients; stir in crab. In a food processor or blender, process bread slices, a few at a time, until fine crumbs form (total volume should be 2-1/2 cups). Add 1 cup to the crab mixture; mix well.
Shape 1/4 cupfuls of crab mixture into patties. Coat both sides of patties with remaining bread crumbs, pressing to adhere. Place on a baking sheet; cover and refrigerate for up to 6 hours.
Meanwhile, for sauce, in a blender of food processor, combine the red pepper, onions, mustard, mayonnaise, shallots, parsley, honey, lemon juice, salt and pepper; cover and process until finely chopped. Refrigerate until serving.
In a large skillet, melt half of butter and half of oil. Place half of the crab cakes in skillet. Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes on each side or until lightly browned (carefully turn the delicate cakes over). Repeat with remaining butter, oil and crab cakes. Serve with sauce and lemon wedges.
