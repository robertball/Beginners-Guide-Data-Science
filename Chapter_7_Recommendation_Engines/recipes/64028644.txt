Ingredients:
2 Haas Avocados
1/2 cup slivered almonds, finely chopped
1 Tbsp of butter (or olive or grapeseed oil)
Salt to taste (sea salt works well)

Directions:
Cut Avocados into halves, then slice and place on separate appetizer plates.
Use a chopper to finely chop almonds, but not till they're dust!
Heat oil in pan until warm/hot.  If I use butter I wait until it starts to bubble.
Add chopped almonds and cook until brown. Stir constantly.  They can go from brown to burnt quickly.
When browned, pour onto a paper towel and let dry/cool until touchable.
Place on top of almonds in even amounts.
Top with salt to taste

Description: 
Super fast!  I think this makes a nice energy boost after a workout, but I often serve it when friends are dropping by as a quick appetizer.
