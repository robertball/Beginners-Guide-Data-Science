Ingredients:
3 Cups Uncooked White rice
6 Cups Water
1.5 Lbs Bratwurst Sausages (Not Just the ground meat)
1 14.5 oz can BAVARIAN style sauerkraut
1 Medium onion thinly sliced in half rings
1/4 Cup Olive oil
1 tsp Minced Garlic
2 tsp Fennel seed
1 tsp Black Pepper
1 TBS Chicken Soup Base (paste)
1/4 Cup Raisins

Directions:
In a large pot, heat oil on medium high heat. Add skinned bratwurst, break apart into various sized ground pieces and fry until brown. Add onions and garlic. Stir until onions are soft. Then add fennel and entire can of kraut with juice. Fry for 2 minutes while stirring. Add white rice and soup base and stir-fry until rice is nicely colored and soup base is incorporated, about 2 minutes. Then add the water, raisins and black pepper. Stir well. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes while stirring. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for approx 30 minutes or until rice is soft and almost no water is left at the bottom of the center of the pot when you move the rice to peek. Serve hot. Enjoy.
Alternate forms of rice cooking work just as well. Like boiling until almost all of the water is even with the top of the rice mixture (no more floating rice), then remove from heat, cover and let sit for 15 minutes.
