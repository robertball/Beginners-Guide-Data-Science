Ingredients:
1 dz med-large jalapenos, cut in half deseeded, deveined.
4oz Herbed Goats cheese
4oz cream cheese
3 oz fine shredded cheddar cheese
2.5 Tbs honey
6 pieces bacon fried crisp. Broken up
Few drops olive oil

Directions:
Heat oven to 350
In a bowl mix cheeses, and honey
I like to rub a little olive oil on the jalapenos and mark on the grill. But you can simply rub a little on each 1/2.
Fill halves with cheese mixture top with a piece or two of bacon, place on baking sheet.
Place in oven for 5-8 min, to warm through and begin melting.
