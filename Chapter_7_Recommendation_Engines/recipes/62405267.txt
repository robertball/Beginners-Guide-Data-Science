Title:
Turkey Sausage Beer Stew Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 tbsp of butter
1 onion diced
1 tbsp of minced garlic
1 package of 6 turkey sausages sliced thin diagonally
2 tbsp strawberry preserve
1 12 oz beer
2 cups H2O
6 potatoes cut in small chunks
1 chicken bouillon cube
2 celery stalks chopped thinly

Directions:
Melt the butter in a deep frying pan. Saute the diced onions and garlic. I cheated and used minced garlic from a jar.
Once the onions and garlic are done, add the turkey sausage. Fry the sausage on medium for about 5-10 minutes. Once cooked through, add the strawberry preserve and mix it in. I left in all the butter and drippings for flavor.
Once it is mixed together, add the beer (I used Bud Lite), water, potatoes, celery, and bouillon cube. Boil. Once it starts boiling, turn heat down to medium, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Serve in bowls with bread on side.
Slow cooker variation...repeat the first 2 steps. Then throw everything into a slow cooker on low for 7 hours.

Description: 
This was one of those what do I have in the fridge meals. I made a quick stew using turkey sausage and some veggies in the fridge. This is a good base, so feel free to play with it.
