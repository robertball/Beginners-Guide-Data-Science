Ingredients:
6 pounds tomatillos, husked
6 small serrano peppers, tops removed
6 cloves garlic
1 1/2 large onions
1/4-1/2 bunch cilantro
1 Tbsp. salt
4 cups chicken broth
1 tsp. cumin
1/2 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Put tomatillos and peppers in a large stockpot.  Cover with water and boil until they are an army green color (roughly 15-20 minutes).  Drain.  Put in a blender with the garlic and onions.  Puree until smooth.  (You may have to do this in batches).  Put the puree in a large pot and add the remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil and boil down for about 45 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool.  Put into quart size freezer bags.  When using, add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup sour cream to the sauce to make it creamy.  Delicious!
To make enchiladas just roll cooked and shredded chicken inside corn tortillas.  Spread the bottom of a 9x13 pan with 1/4 of the sauce.  Place rolled tortillas on top of the sauce.  Smother with remaining sauce.  Add grated cheese and cilantro on top.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
This sauce is an excellent companion in chicken or beef enchiladas.  I make a large batch from the huge tomatillo harvest I get, and then freeze it into quart size freezer bags to use during the year.  There are never any leftovers when enchiladas are made with this sauce!
