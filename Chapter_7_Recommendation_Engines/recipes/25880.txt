Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1 egg
1 2/3 cups HERSHEYÂ®'S Cinnamon Chips, divided
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup ground pecans
1 1/2 teaspoons shortening

Directions:
Beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add corn syrup and egg; mix well.
Place 1 cup cinnamon chips in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at HIGH 1 minute; stir. If necessary, microwave at HIGH an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, just until chips are melted when stirred. Stir melted chips into butter mixture.
Stir together flour, baking soda and salt; add to cinnamon chips mixture, beating just until blended. Cover; refrigerate dough about 1 hour or until firm enough to handle.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape dough into 1-inch balls; roll in nuts, lightly pressing nuts into dough. Place on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until golden around edges. Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet to wire rack. Cool completely. Drizzle with CINNAMON CHIPS DRIZZLE. About 5 dozen cookies.
CINNAMON CHIPS DRIZZLE: Place remaining 2/3 cup cinnamon chips and 1-1/2 teaspoons shortening (do not use butter, margarine, spread or oil) in small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at HIGH  1 minute; stir until chips are melted and mixture is smooth.
