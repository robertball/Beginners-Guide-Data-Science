Ingredients:
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup low protein flour (White Lily or other pastry flour)
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, cold
2 tablespoons shortening, cold
1 cup buttermilk, chilled

Directions:
Cut butter and shortening into slices and freeze for at least 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 475 degrees.
Combine flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl.
Drop butter and shortening into the bowl, and smush butter and shortening into the flour until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Pour in buttermilk and gently combine until dry ingredients are just combined with wet.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and very gently fold dough over itself 5-6 times.
Form into a 1" high rectangle and cut into 2" squares with a pizza cutter or cut with biscuit cutters.
Arrange on a baking sheet so that biscuits are just touching.
Bake 5 minutes, turn off oven.  Bake 10-15 minutes longer while oven is off until biscuits are golden on top.

Description: 
I've never made a lighter, more tender biscuit.  They're quick to make, easy to handle, and are delicious as a breakfast sandwich, or with jam or butter.
