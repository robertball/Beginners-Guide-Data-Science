Description: 
To accompany the sandwiches, serve Tricolor Pasta Salad from Lorraine Darocha of Berkshire, Massachusetts. Pretty pasta spirals and convenient frozen veggies are tossed with a light dressing to make this colorful medley.    'For vegetarians, you can add protein-rich chickpeas or beans to make it a main dish,' Lorraine recommends.Modified from: Tricolor Pasta Salad
