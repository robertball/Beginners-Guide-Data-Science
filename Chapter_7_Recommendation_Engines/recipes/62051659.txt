10 oz goat cheese or fresh mozzarella
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Slice eggplant into 1/4" rounds. Season them with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. Set coated eggplant aside in a bowl. Slice tomatoes and set aside. Cut goat cheese into rounds 1'4" thick.  (Fresh mozzarella can easily be substituted if you don't like goat cheese.)
Put one slice eggplant on the bottom, then layer with sliced tomatoes and cheese. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on the tomatoes and cheese before adding another piece of eggplant on top.  Place the bundles ona tray and secure with toothpicks to keep them from sliding around.(But be sure to remove them before you cook!)
On the BBQ cook on medium heat about 7-8 minutes, then carefully flip and cook the other side 6-7 minutes.
If cooking in the oven, bake at 375F 15-20 minutes or until softened amd melt in your mouth delicious!
