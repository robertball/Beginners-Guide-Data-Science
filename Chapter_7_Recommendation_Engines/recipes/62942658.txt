Description: 
This hails from my dear friend Pat living in Australia. I have tried most banana bread breads out there, but nothing compares to this. I promise, once you make this, you will have found your end-all of banana bread recipes! It is delicately moist and the chopped apricots takes it over the top in exotic taste and beauty! No need for added spices or doctoring up. Make as is, and you will never go back!
