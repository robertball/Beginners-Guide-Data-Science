Ingredients:
2 poblano peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 Anaheim peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 pounds processed cheese food (such as Velveeta Â®), cut into cubes
3 large roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 large white onion, diced
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place poblano peppers, Anaheim peppers, and jalapeno pepper, cut-sides down, on the prepared baking sheet.
Cook peppers under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins; dice peppers.
Combine diced peppers, cheese food cubes, tomatoes, onion, butter, and cumin in a slow cooker.
Cook on Low, gradually adding cream, until cheese melts and dip is heated through, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is the best queso dip! Being from Texas, I know my queso, and I think this is the one that beats them all! It's full of flavor and all fresh ingredients. You can substitute half-and-half for the heavy whipping cream, if desired. Serve with tortilla chips.
