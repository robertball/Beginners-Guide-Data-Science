Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon, diced
1 onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth
5 potatoes, peeled and cubed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate. Stir in the onion, celery, bell pepper, and carrots. Cook and stir until the onions have softened and turned translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, chicken broth, and potatoes. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the diced bacon and season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.

Description: 
Growing up in Indiana we ate a lot of corn in the summer. This is my mom's recipe, and now I make it for my family. Always a hit! Rather than using fresh potatoes, you may substitute frozen hash browns.
