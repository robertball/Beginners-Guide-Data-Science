Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 tablespoons molasses
1 1/2 cups unbleached bread flour
1 cup rye flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup vital wheat gluten
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons dry milk powder
2 teaspoons instant coffee powder
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon caraway seed
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select Whole Wheat cycle, and Start.
After the first rise, remove dough from the machine. Shape, and place into a lightly oiled 9x5-inch loaf pan. Cover, and let rise for 1 hour.
Bake at 350 degrees C (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Remove from oven, remove from pan, and let cool completely on wire rack before slicing.

Description: 
This is a hearty bread. Mix it in the bread machine (or stand mixer) but bake it in the oven. I recommend baking in the oven instead of the machine because the loaf is fuller and the top is much nicer. I hope you enjoy it.
