Ingredients:
2 lbs. Ground meat
1 cup water
1 can Rotel tomatoes (medium heat)
1 can stew tomatoes, break up the tomatoes into small pieces
1 can pinto beans
1 can pinto beans with jalapeno
optional, extra jalapenos from a jar, cut up
1 can corn, drained
1 pkg. taco seasoning
1 packette of dry Hidden Valley Salad Dressing, *important-not the dip!!!
1 can tomato soup, optional

Directions:
Brown the ground meat in a skillet, drain.  Add all ingredients into a soup pot bring to a boil; simmer for 2 hours.
Or you can cook this in a crockpot.
Adding the can of tomato soup will make it thicker similar to chili.
*Only add water after it has cooked and you feel it needs  little moisture to adjust to your liking. Add a little water at a time, let simmer to blend well.
I do not add water to mine.
