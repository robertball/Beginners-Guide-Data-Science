Ingredients:
12 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and chopped
4 oranges
6 cups white sugar

Directions:
Place the peaches into a large bowl. Scrub the oranges then chop into pieces - including the peel. This is easiest done in a food processor so you don't lose as much juice. Transfer to the bowl with the peaches. Stir in sugar, cover, and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, pour the entire contents of the bowl into a large pot. Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Make sure the heat is low enough, or the jam will burn and stick to the bottom of the pot. This does not need to come to a rolling boil.
While the jam simmers, sterilize your jars in boiling water for at least 5 minutes, and keep hot. Prepare new lids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ladle the jam into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch of headspace. Wipe the rims with a clean damp cloth or paper towel, and seal with lids and rings. Process according to guidelines suggested by your local extension.
