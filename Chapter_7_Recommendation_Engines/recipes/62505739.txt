Ingredients:
2 Cups (500ml) dry (unprepared) instant coffee (not freeze dried)
7 Cups (1.75L) white granulated sugar
1 Quart (0.95L) water
1 Quart (0.95L) 80 proof (40% alcohol) vodka (no particular brand)
1 Whole vanilla bean

Directions:
Bring the water to a full boil. Remove from heat and add the instant coffee and the sugar.
Stir constantly until the sugar and coffee are completely dissolved.
Allow the mixture to cool, then add vodka and stir.
Pour into two separate 1-quart, sealable glass containers.
Drop one half of the vanilla bean into each container. Seal tightly.
Apply a label or tie a note around the container identifying its contents and the date it was made.
Allow the product to age by placing it in a cool, dark place where it will be undisturbed for at least 30 days; the longer, the better!

Description: 
This is an excellent suggestion for a home-made gift (or something you can keep for yourself). But if you want to use it during the Christmas holidays, start in early November.
