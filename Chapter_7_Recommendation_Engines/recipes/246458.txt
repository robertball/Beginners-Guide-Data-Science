Ingredients:
Sloppy Joes:
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 pound ground pork
3 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
1 (1 inch) piece minced fresh ginger root
1 stalk lemongrass, tough outer stalks removed, inner stalks thinly sliced
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons ketchup
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Wasabi Slaw:
1 (10 ounce) package shredded cabbage
2 tablespoons wasabi-flavored mayonnaise (such as Trader Joe'sÂ®)
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon lime juice
4 whole-wheat hamburger buns

Directions:
Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pork; cook and stir until pork is no longer pink, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add scallions, ginger, lemongrass, and garlic powder; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
Reduce heat to low. Stir in soy sauce and ketchup. Cook until flavors combine and mixture thickens slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Combine cabbage, wasabi mayonnaise, rice vinegar, and lime juice in a large bowl; toss to mix slaw.
Split each bread roll and fill with pork mixture. Top with slaw before serving.

Description: 
Serve on white or whole-wheat buns with wasabi slaw and pickles. I make them on the drier side so they are not impossible to eat - tweak the recipe to make them as 'sloppy' as you like!
