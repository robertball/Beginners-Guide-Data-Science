Ingredients:
1/2 pound pork liver
1/2 pound pork lung
1/2 pound pork heart, cut into bite-size pieces
2 bay leaves
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup water
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tomatoes, diced

Directions:
Place the pork liver and the pork lung in two separate pots and cover with water. Bring each pot to a boil; cook at a boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain both and allow to cool before chopping into bite-size pieces. Set aside.
Combine the liver, lung, and heart in a large pot over medium heat; add the bay leaves, vinegar, and water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes into the mixture and simmer 5 minutes. Pour the pork liver mixture from the pot into the saucepan; cook and stir together for 5 minutes more. Serve hot.
