Ingredients:
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup boiling water
1 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg yolk
2 egg whites
2/3 cup canola oil
1/2 cup low-fat (1%) Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons orange zest
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line muffin tins with paper liners.
Pour boiling water over the dried cranberries and allow them to soak for 10 minutes.
In a medium mixing bowl, stir together all the dry ingredients.
In the bowl of a stand mixer that is outfitted with a paddle attachment, place the egg yolk, oil, agave, and yogurt and mix for two minutes until combined.
Add the dry ingredients in three stages, mixing on low speed and scraping the sides of the bowl with each addition.
Drain the cranberries, discard the water, and add the cranberries to the batter along with the orange zest. Mix to combine.
In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white to medium peaks. Add a small amount of the egg whites to the batter and stir to combine (this will lighten the batter a bit). Fold the remaining egg whites into the batter, carefully so as to not deflate the whites.
Scoop into muffin tins. Fill the tins three-quarters full. If desired, sprinkle sugar crystals on the top of muffins.
Bake for 20 to 22 minutes.
