Description: 
I love chia seeds. They are not only good for you but taste great. Chia seeds are very filling and can keep you full for several hours. This Mexican mocha chia seed pudding can be a snack or a yummy breakfast. This pudding is not only sweet but a little spicy as well. I usually keep it for up to 4 days in the fridge. Dust cocoa powder and dollop whipped cream on top if desired.
