Ingredients:
1 lb of dry pinto beans
4 medium onions sliced
4 cups of chicken broth
2 Tbsp of minced garlic
2 cans of green chili or jalapeño
Salt & Pepper to taste
½ pound of bacon (fried & crumbled)

Directions:
Soak the beans overnight in water.  Rinse the beans in a colander before placing in pressure cooker.
Place beans, onions, garlic and chicken broth in pressure cooker.  DO NOT SALT! (This will cause your beans to toughen)  Once under pressure cook for 30 minutes (40 minutes at 7500 ft).
Slice raw bacon into bite size pieces.  Fry and save grease.
Release steam and open pressure cooker.  Stir in all bacon and grease.  Add cans of chili (with juice) and salt & pepper to taste.  Bring back to pressure and cook another 10 minutes (15 minutes at 7500 ft).
