1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup white sugar

1/4 cup margarine
1/4 cup blanched slivered almonds
1/4 cup sesame seeds
2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodle pasta, crushed
1 medium head bok choy
3 green onions

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, oil, sugar and soy sauce.  Set aside.
Melt the margarine over medium heat in a small skillet.   Crush the ramen noodles while still in their packaging, and add to the margarine along with the almonds and sesame seeds.  Saute until everything is golden brown.  Remove from heat and drain on a paper towel.
Chop the bok choy and green onions and add to a large bowl.  Just before serving, sprinkle with the noodle mixture and dressing, and toss to coat.
