Ingredients:
1 meaty ham bone, fat trimmed
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 onion, chopped

6 red potatoes, cubed
4 large carrots, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

1 cup milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place ham bone in a slow cooker; top with chicken stock, onion, and garlic.
Cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours.
Remove ham bone from slow cooker; pull meat of bone and shred. Return meat to slow cooker and discard ham bone. Add potatoes, carrots, parsley, and cumin to soup.
Cook on High until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Add frozen corn and stir.
Remove 1 cup soup and pour into a blender. Add milk to blender. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Return blended soup to slow cooker and stir. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Couldn't find an after Christmas ham chowder recipe that started with slow cooking the ham bone leftovers. Ended up taking ideas from multiple recipes to create something that worked out pretty well.
