Description: 
These are wonderfully delicious spicy, sweet, salty, sticky asian style chicken wings.  The garlic and ginger spiced hoisin and teriyaki sauces combined with the brown sugar and hot garlic chili sauce makes these wings fly off the platter!  They make a great appetizer or light meal for watching the big game.  They are excellent served with extra sauce as a dipping sauce or with an asian slaw.
