Description: 
When I first tried lassi at an indian restaurant, I just had to discover how to make it at home. After some research, I discovered it is beautifully simple. I tried it and yes, it really is that easy and delicious, perfect as a summer drink. I make a really simple version, but anyone can make it fancier by adding cardamom and honey
