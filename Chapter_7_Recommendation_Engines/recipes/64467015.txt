Ingredients:
1 Dinomite looking to find Fluffy Friends.
So Many Googly Eyes - favoured food of Fluffy Friends the World over.
5 Inches Flour
10 Yellow/Green Food Colouring
1 Bag
Serving bowl, table cloth, kitchen.

Directions:
Follow these directions to the letter. Cooking is chemistry, after all! This recipe may not be very forgiving, but all your hard work will pay off when you have a Fluffy Friend or Two to enjoy your beautiful bites with!
Combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Knead until the eyes twinkle and the dough is a consistent colour with the texture of sacking.
Place the bag in the bottom of your serving bowl. This will provide a base for you or your guest(s) to stand on while surrounded by the bounty you are about to enjoy. Add the Fluffy Bites (much more appetizing now than regular googly eyes) and wait.
With practice you will find that the enticing aroma of this dish will bring Fluffy Friends from miles around EVERY TIME.
Use your new powerful kitchen skills wisely and you will never want for companionship again!
Set the table, climb in, and wait (it won't be long if done correctly)!
