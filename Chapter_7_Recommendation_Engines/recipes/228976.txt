Ingredients:
30 saltine crackers
2 tablespoons dry potato flakes
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 egg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch strips
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place crackers in a resealable bag; crush into coarse crumbs. Mix cracker crumbs, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Beat egg in a separate small bowl. Place flour in a third shallow bowl.
Coat chicken pieces in flour, beaten egg, and cracker mixture, respectively.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips until no longer pink in the center and coating is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
