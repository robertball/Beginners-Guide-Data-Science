Ingredients:
6 med. potatoes, cubed & cooked with 2 tsp. lemon juice in water (keeps spuds white!)
4 hard cooked eggs
1/4 cup chopped onion, regular and green, as per preference
1 cup diced celery
4 - 5 sliced radishes
Dressing:
3/4 cup mayo
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tsp. mustard
1 tsp. sugar
2 - 3 tbsp. bacon bits
1 tsp. celery seed
heaping tsp. dill weed
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 cup milk
1 tbsp. vinegar
sprinkle paprika

Directions:
Peel and cube potatoes and cook in salted water w/lemon juice till still just barely cooked (unless u prefer the salad a bit mushy - as mixing it together will mash the spuds a bit).
Rinse cooked potatoes in cold water. Drain well. Let cool in fridge.
Mix together dressing ingredients. This can be done ahead & stored in the fridge. This also gives the flavors a chance to blend. Adjust ingredients to get flavor you like.
Stir together potatoes with other ingredients and mix in dressing well.

Description: 
A summer favorite at any BBQ. We usually serve the onions on the side so ppl can add as many as they like. I want to try adding some snap peas to this salad!
