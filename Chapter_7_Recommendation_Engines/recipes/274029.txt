Ingredients:
2 teaspoons garlic powder

2 teaspoons onion powder
Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 cup heavy whipping cream
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, and pepper in a shallow dish. Add chicken strips and toss until coated on all sides.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add seasoned chicken strips. Cook and stir until browned on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove cooked chicken strips from skillet and set aside.
Keep skillet on medium heat and pour in heavy whipping cream to deglaze skillet, scraping up all brown bits. Lower heat and simmer until sauce has reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir until melted. Add chicken back to skillet and heat until chicken is warmed thoroughly. Season with salt.
