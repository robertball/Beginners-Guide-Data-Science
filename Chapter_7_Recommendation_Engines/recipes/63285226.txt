Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup cider vinegar
2 C low sodium chicken broth (or you could sub water)
2 Tbsp cornstarch, dissolved in Tbsp of the broth or water
1 large, or 2 small bunches green onions, slice both white and green parts
1 # center cut bacon, diced
5 # red salad or Yukon Gold potatoes; boiled & cooled; peeled & sliced--but not too thinly sliced
1/2 cup rough chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Saute bacon over medium heat until crisp.  Do not allow to get too brown, but be sure to cook through.
Remove from pan & drain on paper towels.
Saute onion in the bacon drippings until clear & limp; remove from pan and add to paper towel to drain.
Heat sugar, vinegar and water to a boil.  Remove from heat; stir in dissolved cornstarch.  Return to medium low heat.  Add bacon & onion.  Gently stir to combine.
Place still warm, sliced potatoes in buttered oven proof casserole dish; add hot sauce to the mix and gently stir to combine well.  Garnish with chopped parsley.  Bake at 350 for 45 minutes or until bubbly.
You can make the day before, and refrigerate without baking.  Be sure to allow casserole to come to room temperature before placing in oven.

Description: 
Many years ago in Milwaukee my mom would get German potato salad and ring balogna from Schusters--a department store.  This recipe is my version of that potato salad.  We especially love this with grilled brats & saurkraut.
