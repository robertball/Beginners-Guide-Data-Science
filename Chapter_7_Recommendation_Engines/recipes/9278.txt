Ingredients:
1 cup dried currants
2 cups raisins
1 cup candied cherries
1 ounce small gum drops, no licorice ones
2 cups pitted dates, cut in half
1 1/4 cups chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoons ground allspice
1/4 cup brandy
1 cup apple jelly
2 cups boiling water
1 1/4 cups butter
3 cups white sugar
7 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Pour boiling water over raisins and currants to cover.  Let steam for 5 minutes, then drain.  In a very large bowl combine currants, raisins, gum drops, candied cherries, pitted dates,  jelly, spices, and brandy wine or fruit juice.  Stir to blend.  Cover and let stand overnight.
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).  Grease three 8x4 inch loaf pans.
Cream the butter and the sugar together until light and creamy.  Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each one.  Stir in the vanilla.
Sift the flour and baking soda together.
Add the flour mixture alternately with the fruit mixture to the creamed mixture.  Pour evenly into three loaf pans.
Bake at 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) for 2-1/4 to 3 hours or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean.

Description: 
This is the fruitcake my mother made from the time I was a little girl.  It isn't full of the citrus fruits, and I've never met anyone who didn't like it. Originally submitted to CakeRecipe.com.  You can use fruit juice instead of the brandy, if you prefer.
