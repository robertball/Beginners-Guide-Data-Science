Ingredients:
cooking spray
12 slices bacon
10 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup diced jalapeno pepper
1/4 cup diced roasted red pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Arrange bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Cook bacon in microwave for 75 seconds.
Place a slice of bacon into each muffin cup so that the bacon lines the edges of the cup.
Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; ladle into muffin cups. Top 4 of the egg portions with 1 tablespoon each of the green onion, 4 with 1 tablespoon each jalapeno pepper, and 4 each with 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper.
Bake in preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, about 20 minutes. Season the muffins with salt and pepper; top with Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.
