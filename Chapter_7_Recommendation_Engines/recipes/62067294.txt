Ingredients:
1 can (15 oz.) salmon, drained
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup minced onion
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon Old Bay crab seasoning
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon  mayonnaise
1/4
teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
oil for frying

Directions:
1. Drain and debone salmon; then flake. Add all other ingredients except the oil and mix very well.
2. Shape the salmon mixture into six patties.
3. Fry over medium-low heat about 5 minutes until the patties are nicely browned on both sides, turning halfway through. If heat is too high, patties will go quickly from uncooked to burnt.
