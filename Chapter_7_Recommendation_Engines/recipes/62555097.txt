Ingredients:
1 box brownie mix
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons creme de menthe liqueur
6 tablespoons butter
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Mix and Bake brownies according to package directions. Cool completely in the pan.
In a small bowl, beat the confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup butter or margarine and creme de menthe until smooth. Spread evenly over the cooled brownies, then chill until set.
In a small bowl over simmering water, or in the microwave, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter and the chocolate chips, stirring occasionally until smooth. Allow to cool slightly, then spread over the top of the mint layer. Cover, and chill for at least 1 hour before cutting into squares.
