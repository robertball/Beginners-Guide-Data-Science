Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package JohnsonvilleÂ® Italian All Natural Ground Sausage
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
2 (12 ounce) loaves focaccia bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1 small green bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1 (4.25 ounce) can ripe olives, chopped
1/2 cup chopped pimento-stuffed olives
5 large basil leaves, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups water or white wine
1/4 cup butter, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a skillet, cook and crumble sausage in 1 tbsp. olive oil until no longer pink, about 5 minutes; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine bread cubes and remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with pepper; toss to coat.
Transfer to a greased 10x15-inch baking pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until crisp and lightly browned, stirring once.
Remove pan to a wire rack to cool slightly.
In a very large bowl, combine reserved sausage, the bread cubes, Parmesan cheese, green pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, basil, and garlic.
Whisk eggs and water in a bowl; pour over bread mixture and toss to coat.
Transfer to a buttered 9x13-inch baking dish.
Dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, until heated through, 35 to 40 minutes.
