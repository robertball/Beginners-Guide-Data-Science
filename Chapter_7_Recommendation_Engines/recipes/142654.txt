Ingredients:
½ cup flour for dredging
5  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter
¼ cup port wine
½ cup dry white wine
½ cup chicken stock
6  dried figs (stems removed)
2 tablespoons heavy cream

Directions:
Place the flour in a shallow dish. Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the chicken in the preheated skillet until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Pour the port, white wine, and chicken stock over the chicken, and scatter the figs around the skillet.
Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce heat to low, simmer until chicken is fully cooked, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and cover with foil.
Bring the sauce in the skillet to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the cream and pour over the chicken to serve.
