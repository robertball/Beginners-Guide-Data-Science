Ingredients:
4lb bag of frozen chicken wings/drums
2 sticks butter
2 bottles franks hot sauce
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tbs worcestershire sauce
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
In a sauce pan, combine 1 bottle of franks red hot sauce with one stick of butter, worcestershire sauce, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder and cook for five minutes on low.
Place chicken wings in crock pot and cover with sauce.  Turn on high and cook for 2 hours, then turn to low and cook 2 additional hours.
Next, turn oven to 400 and place the wings on greased cookie sheets for about 30 minutes.  This will crisp up the wings.
In a saucepan, combine 1 bottle of Frank's hot sauce and 1 stick of butter.  Cook on low for about 20 minutes.  Sauce should reduce and thicken up.  Brush sauce on wings and serve with Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing.
