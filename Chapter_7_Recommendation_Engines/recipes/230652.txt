Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
2 (15 ounce) cans green beans, drained
5 cups mashed potatoes
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Drain excess grease. Stir cream of mushroom soup and green beans into ground beef and bring to a simmer.
Spread ground beef mixture into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Spread mashed potatoes evenly over ground beef mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is an awesome recipe that I got from my coworker. It can be modified in many ways, including for the slow cooker. It's a simple meal of things you often already have on hand that really sticks to the bones, and it can also be a fun way to use up some leftovers.
