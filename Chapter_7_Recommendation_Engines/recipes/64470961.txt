Ingredients:
4 cups chocolate rice crisp cereal and 1 cup white or brown rice crisp cereal, mixed
7.5 oz (one jar) marshmallow creme
1/4 cup margarine
1.5 oz (or 1 1.4 oz package) toasted coconut chips, crushed
2 tbsp dark, chocolate, or coconut rum

Directions:
Butter (or margarine or nonstick spray) the bottom and sides of a lasagna pan (10.5 x 14.5)
In a large saucepan, melt margarine over low-medium heat. As it melts, stir in marshmallow creme. When it's all melted and mixed thoroughly, remove from heat.
Stir in rum, and then immediately stir in rice cereal until it's completely incorporated
Press mixture into your buttered pan. Sprinkle crushed coconut chips evenly over the top.
Let cool, and then cut into 1.5 inch squares.

Description: 
These tasty chocolate-coconut-rum variations on the traditional cereal treat are fluffy in three ways: they're made with marshmallow creme (aka fluff) so they taste fluffy, they have coconut on top so they look fluffy, and they have alcohol in them, so if you eat enough, you may start to feel fluffy!

They're a fun, grown-up twist on an old favorite. Enjoy!
