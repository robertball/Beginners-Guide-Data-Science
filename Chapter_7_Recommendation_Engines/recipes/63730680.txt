Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. ground chuck
1 pkg. onion soup mix
1 egg
1/2 tsp. black pepper
2 Tbsp. water
1/3 cup plain breadcrumbs
24 small square dinner rolls
American cheese. dill pickle slices, dusseldorf mustard optional.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Mix first 6 ingredients together and spread in a 10x15 jelly roll pan.
Prick holes throughout to let steam escape.
Bake for 10 mins. and drain all drippings.
Cut to fit dinner rolls ( I like to lay roll tops on meat and cut)
White Castle hamburgers are served with pickles on them. Cheese optional, and what they call everything would include the dusseldorf mustard

If you are from the Chicago area, you have heard of white castle hamburgers. I believe down south they are crystals. This is the closest I have come to the real deal. ENJOY!!!
