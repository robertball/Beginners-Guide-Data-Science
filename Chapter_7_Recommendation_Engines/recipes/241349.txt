Ingredients:
1 cup quick-cooking oats
½ cup skim milk
½ cup peanut butter
½ cup almond butter
1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste
2 small very ripe bananas
1 cup vanilla protein powder (such as Vi-SHAPE(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon ground flaxseed, or more to taste
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking dish with baking parchment.
Spread oats onto a baking sheet and toast in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Stir milk, peanut butter, almond butter, and honey together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook, stirring regularly, until the nut butters are melted and the mixture is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Mash bananas into the milk mixture and cook until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Remove saucepan from heat and stir toasted oats, protein powder, flaxseed, and sesame seeds into wet ingredients until the mixture is somewhat even; spread into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Cool bars completely before cutting, wrapping in plastic, and storing in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I love these protein bars! They are quick, easy and cheap. They come out a little soft, but if you freeze them you get a more bar-like consistency. Tastes so much better than the chalky protein bars you buy for $3!
