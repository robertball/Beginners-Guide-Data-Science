Ingredients:
4 lb roasting chicken
1 tsp orange peel, freshly grated
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
***Glaze***
4 Tbsp honey
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
2 Tbsp rum
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp orange peel

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Remove giblet packet from inside bird, wash the chicken and pat dry.  Mix together grated orange peel and salt and pepper (amounts to your taste; I used about a 1/2 tsp. of each) and rub the skin of bird with mixture.  (You could also use dried orange peel in place of the freshly grated peel.  If using dried, pour some olive oil on a paper towel and "blot" chicken all over before rubbing in seasonings.)
Place the chicken in a roasting pan breast side down, and roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, wthe chicken is roasting, make the glaze.  Dissolve the honey in the orange juice over a medium-high flame in a small saucepan.  Stir in the rum, ground ginger, and nutmeg.  Taste, and add additional orange peel if desired (I did so).   Boil the glaze mixture for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until slightly reduced and thickened.  Turn off heat and let cool.
Brush or spoon half of the glaze over the back of the bird and roast for another 10 minutes.  Turn the bird breast side up and continue roasting for another 45-60 minutes, spooning remainder of the honey-orange glaze and pan juices occasionally over the bird until the meat is tender and nicely browned.  Remove the chicken from the oven to a platter and let rest for 10 minutes.  Slice and serve with pan juices/glaze spooned over servings.
