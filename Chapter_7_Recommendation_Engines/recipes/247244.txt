Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds small (about 2-inch diameter) Red Bliss potatoes
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
1 (750 milliliter) bottle dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
1 (1 pound) cooked chorizo sausage (preferably Spanish), cut into 8 pieces
4 (1 1/2) pounds lobsters
48 littleneck clams, scrubbed
4 ears fresh corn, husked and halved crosswise

Directions:
Pour 1 gallon of water into a lobster pot or stockpot large enough to hold all ingredients. Add potatoes and salt and bring to a boil. Cook, covered, 10 minutes (potatoes will be slightly softened but not cooked through).
Put coriander, fennel, thyme, and peppercorns in a large piece of cheesecloth. Gather edges together and tie with kitchen string to make a pouch.
Add spice pouch, wine, chorizo, and lobsters to pot with potatoes. Boil, covered, 5 minutes. Add clams and corn and cook, covered, until lobsters are cooked and clams have opened, about 5 minutes (discard any unopened clams).
Cut each lobster in half using a heavy knife and kitchen shears. Serve each person half a lobster, 6 clams, half an ear of corn, 2 potatoes, and a piece of chorizo.
