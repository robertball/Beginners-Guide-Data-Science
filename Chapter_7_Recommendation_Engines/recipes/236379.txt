Ingredients:
1 banana, mashed
3 eggs
1/4 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon almond butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk banana, eggs, almond flour, almond butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder together in a bowl until batter is smooth.
Heat olive oil on a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
