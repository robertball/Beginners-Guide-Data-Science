Description: 
These truffles have been a family favorite for over 30 years! The almond extract and the butterscotch chips make a wonderful rich flavor when melted with the semisweet chocolate chips. If you're looking for a treat to take to your next holiday party, this is it! Place truffles into containers to store and keep refrigerated. If giving the truffles as a gift and needing to stack them inside a container or tin, cut waxed paper the size of the container or tin and place the waxed paper on top of each single layer of truffles.
