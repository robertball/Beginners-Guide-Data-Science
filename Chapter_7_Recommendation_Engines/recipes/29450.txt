Ingredients:
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 pound salmon
1 cup white wine
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup chopped shallots

Directions:
In a small bowl, blend the plain yogurt, Dijon mustard, honey, lemon juice, and dill. Cover, and refrigerate until serving.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the salmon in the white wine and water. Adjust the amount of water as necessary to just cover the fish. Sprinkle with shallots. Cover the saucepan, and cook 10 to 12 minutes, until salmon is easily flaked with a fork. Drain, and serve with the yogurt sauce.

Description: 
This is an easy, elegant, wonderful salmon dish with a no-cook sauce. It really doesn't get much easier. I love it best on swelteringly hot summer days. Fresh steamed asparagus goes very well with this, and the sauce tastes good on it as well.
