Description: 
I made up this recipe after having a craving for cabbage rolls but no time to make them.  This is a super quick, healthy, hearty recipe, so simple to make and can be adjusted to your liking.  You can easily double the recipe and freeze leftovers in portions.  Serve piping hot with crusty bread or garlic toast.
