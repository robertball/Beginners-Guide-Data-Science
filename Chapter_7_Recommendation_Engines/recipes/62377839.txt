Description: 
This is so simple...yet delicious. I do not typically like ketchup, but my whole family loves this dip!!! Dip it with plain chips, or we use the kettle cooked crunchy ones. Just a nice dip to share at a picnic or outing, or to just have around the house. Not at all bad on a burger either!!!!
