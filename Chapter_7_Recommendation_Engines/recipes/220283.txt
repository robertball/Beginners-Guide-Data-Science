Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons dry mustard
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 1/2 pounds halibut fillet
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 red onion, chopped
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup canned Cheddar-flavored French-fried onions

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, dry mustard, melted butter, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon dried dill in a 9x13-casserole dish.
Coat fish with seasoned olive oil mixture, turning several times to coat. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour (up to overnight) to marinate.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix sour cream, red onion, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, parsley, garlic, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon dill in a bowl until combined.
Spread sour cream mixture over fish.
Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over sour cream mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
Remove fish from oven and top with French-fried onions. Return to oven and bake until onions are lightly browned, about 10 more minutes.
