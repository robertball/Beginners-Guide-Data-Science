Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup finely chopped baby carrots
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound meatolaf mix
1 cup whole milk
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes (Tutorroso Italian)
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried basil or italian seasoning (I used abt. 1/2 tsp - 3/4 tsp)
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (if not making for kids, increase to 1/2 tsp)
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the carrots, onion, and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove to crockpot.
Place the meatloaf mix into the same skillet and cook and stir, breaking up the meat as it cooks, until mostly browned. Drain off excess fat from the skillet, and pour in 1 cup milk. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the milk is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Place the beef mixture into a slow cooker, and set the cooker to low. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, seasonings, and red pepper flakes, and cook for 4 hours. Mix in 1/2 cup milk and Parmesan cheese, stir well, and cook for 4 more hours on low.
