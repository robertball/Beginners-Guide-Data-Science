Description: 
I threw this together one day when the family was craving BBQ, but we didn't want to spend the day tending the grill. After giving it to my son, his 4 kids demanded it 3 times in one week! As for me, I like it better without the bun. Why fill up on bun when you've got all that tasty pork?
