Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup rice
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (26 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 cup milk
1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated flaky-style biscuit dough, separated

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour just enough water into a large skillet to cover the bottom in a shallow layer; add chicken pieces in a single layer. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Turn heat to medium-high and cook chicken, adding water as needed to keep pan wet, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes; drain liquid.
Stir cooked rice, cooked chicken, cream of chicken soup, milk, and Mexican blend cheese together in a casserole dish. Smooth the top of the mixture with the back of a spoon. Arrange biscuit dough over the bottom layer, breaking dough pieces as needed to get maximum coverage and to avoid overlap.
Bake in preheated oven until the biscuit topping is golden brown and the bottom layer is heated through completely, 20 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
If you love rice, cream of chicken soup, and biscuits, this is the meal for you. I remember when I was younger and my mother had made something similar to this in a kit. I decided to try to remake it without a kit to how I remember it.  It's perfect for those cool rainy days.
