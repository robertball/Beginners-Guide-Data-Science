Description: 
I saw a Vitamix® demo the other day. Then I realized my Waring Pro® blender at home was already fully capable of the same smoothie greatness, so I got inspired to cram more nutrients into my life by blending them up. The resulting mixture is happy and bright green, but it tastes more like bananas and peanut butter. I can't taste the spinach (though I love it). If it's too thick, use more milk or/and less yogurt and peanut butter. Feel free to substitute nuts for your favorites.
