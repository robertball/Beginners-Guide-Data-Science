Haystack (the best 7-layer dip ever) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
20 ounces spicy jalapeno refried beans (1/2 cans)
2 avocados
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonaise
1/2 packet taco seasoning
2 medium sized tomatoes diced
10 green onions diced
2 cups sprouts
2 cups medium cheddar cheese - grated

Directions:
Set out a large platter, square or round cookie sheet sized.
Blend together refried beans and avocados and spread onto platter in an even layer.
Combine sour cream, mayo and taco seasoning and spread on top of first layer.
Chop onions and tomatoes and spread evenly as your third layer.
Spread sprouts out as your next layer.
Grate cheese and use this as the top layer.
This is incredibly easy, but the mix of ingredients make this such an awesome appetizer.  It may not actually be 7 layers, but that's what Grandma called it so I never argued!
I have found that ruffles or wavy potato chips are the best to go with this dip.  Enjoy!!!

This is my Grandma Valma's recipe that I bring to any holiday/party/shower or gathering and it is always gone well before anything else.  I have friends and relatives call and request that I bring this because they have been craving it since the last party.
