Ingredients:
7 (1 inch) thick slices brioche bread
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup raisins
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Tear bread into 1-inch pieces and place in an 8-inch square baking dish. Drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle with pecans and raisins.
Whisk milk, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a medium bowl until combined and pour over bread mixture in the baking dish. Press gently on the bread until saturated. Let sit for a few minutes.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until top is puffed but set, about 40 minutes. Pudding will settle back down as it cools.
