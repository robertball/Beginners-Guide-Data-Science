Ingredients:
1 cup (1/2" dice) white watermelon rind (Cut off the green skin and the red or yellow flesh.)
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tsp finely chopped lemongrass
Additional sugar

Directions:
Place parchment paper on cookie sheet.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Set aside.
Cover rind with water in medium saucepan.  Bring to boil, then simmer for 5 minutes.  Drain, set rind aside, wash out pan.
Place salt, rind and enough water to cover back in saucepan.  Bring to boil, simmer for 10 minutes.  Drain, set rind aside.  Wash pan.
Place 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemongrass in saucepan.  Bring to boil, stirring a few times.  Add watermelon rind,, stir to coat with sugar syrup.
Simmer, stirring occasionally for 1/2 hour.  Much evaporation should have taken place.  Watch carefully, stirring frequently, for most of the liquid to completely evaporate over the next 1/2 hour or so.
Place watermelon rind on sugared parchment paper.  Roll to coat with sugar. As it cools, toss with additional sugar, if needed.
Store in tightly sealed container with additional sugar.  This keeps indefinitely!
