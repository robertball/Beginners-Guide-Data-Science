Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon dried ginger
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup peanuts, crushed*
1 teaspoon chili flakes, optional
Sea salt, to taste
Sliced green onion, to garnish

Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, garlic, honey and ginger. Pour marinade into a re-sealable freezer bag and add chicken. Release extra air, then seal. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 375°F, then line a 13x9” baking dish with foil. In a shallow dish, combine bread crumbs, peanuts, chili flakes and salt. Dip marinated chicken into the mixture, one piece at a time, coating well.
3. Transfer chicken to prepared baking dish. Cook, uncovered, until opaque and firm to the touch, about 25-30 minutes. Garnish with green onion.
