Ingredients:
1 lb Lean Ground Turkey
1 Can (14 oz.) Red Kidney Beans
1 Can (14.5 oz.)Zesty Chili Style Tomatoes
1 Can (15.25 oz.) Whole Kernel Sweet Corn
1 Can (15 oz.) Tomato Sauce
1 Med Onion, finely chopped

1 pkg. McCormickÂ® Tex-Mex Seasoning Mix
Spices to season ground turkey:
Ground Black Pepper
Salt
Paprika
Cayenne pepper
Cumin
Oregano

Directions:
Chop onion, mushrooms, cilantro. Set aside until needed.  I also drain/rinse the kidney beans and corn, but this is not required.
Season with spices and brown ground turkey in skillet over medium heat, drain (if needed) and set aside.
Saute onion and mushrooms until browned/tender in skillet over medium heat.
Combine seasoned turkey, kidney beans, tomatoes, corn, tomato sauce, onion, mushrooms, cilantro, Texas Pete and seasoning mix in crock pot.
Can either set crock pot on low and leave during the day or set on high for about 2 hours.  Another option is to heat in a large pot on stove-top over med-high heat.
Top with cheddar cheese and sour cream, if desired.
