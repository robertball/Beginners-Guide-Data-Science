Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3/4 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons cornmeal

Directions:
In a small bowl stir together the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir to dissolve and set aside.
In a large bowl dissolve baking soda with the 1 1/2 teaspoons warm water. Add the warm milk, salt, and one cup of the flour. Beat with a wire whisk until smooth. Beat in yeast mixture and remaining flour. Batter should be thick, sticky, and smooth.
Prepare 2 pie pans with non-stick spray. Dust pans with cornmeal.  Place 1/2 dough in each pie pan. Batter will spread during rising time. Spray top of dough with non-stick cooking spray. Cover and let rise for one hour.
Repeat spraying of bread with non-stick cooking spray. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
Allow to cool for an hour before slicing.

Description: 
The dough will look resemble a batter, almost pourable. Take care not to add too much flour. If using all-purpose flour, use a little less as it is heavier than bread flour. Great to eat hot from the oven with butter.
