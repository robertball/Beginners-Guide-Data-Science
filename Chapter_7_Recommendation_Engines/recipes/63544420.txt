Ingredients:
2 qt water
2 c Basmati or Jasmine rice
4 T unsalted butter
2 T salt
4 fresh bay leaves (or 6 dried leaves)

Directions:
Preheat over to 400.
Add water and bay leaves to a 2.5 qt (or larger) pot and bring to a boil.
Add rice and salt, stirring ONCE to ensure no air pockets are trapped in rice.
Once the water returns to a boil, stir ONCE more to make sure the rice does not stick.
DO NOT STIR AGAIN!
Partially cover and boil for 11-13 minutes.  Rice is done when it is firm, but not crunchy.  Think al dente pasta.
Strain rice and pick out the bay leaves.
Place rice in a baking dish and place pats of butter on top.  Bake for 15 min.
