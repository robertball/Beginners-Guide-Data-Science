1/3 cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank'sÂ® RedHot)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place Buffalo sauce, olive oil, and butter in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat until butter is melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir to combine. Add cauliflower florets and toss to coat.
Spread cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Continue baking until slightly toasted, about 10 minutes more.
