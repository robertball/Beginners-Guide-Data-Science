Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2/3 cup quinoa
1 carrot, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 (15 ounce) cans chicken broth
3 1/2 cups water
2 large tomatoes, finely chopped
1/4 head cabbage, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot on medium-high heat.  Stir in the quinoa, carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, and garlic.  Cook for a few minutes, until lightly browned, stirring frequently.
Pour in the chicken broth, water, tomatoes, and cabbage.  Increase heat to high and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium and simmer until the quinoa and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley before servings.

Description: 
I had never heard of quinoa until I went to Peru and discovered a delicious, traditional soup. There are a lot of ingredients, but it is worth the work!
