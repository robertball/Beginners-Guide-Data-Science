Ingredients:
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg white, beaten
1/3 cup finely chopped shelled pistachios
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Unfold the sheets of puff pastry, and brush tops with egg white. Sprinkle pistachios and salt over the egg white wash; flip the sheets, brush with egg white, and sprinkle with pistachios and salt. With a sharp knife, cut pastry into 3-inch long strips, about 3/4 inch wide. Twist the strips twice, then arrange on the prepared baking sheets so they don't touch.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Originally a recipe from the 1960's that was meant to be served with drinks for a St. Paddy's day celebration. Personally, I think these are good for any occasion!
