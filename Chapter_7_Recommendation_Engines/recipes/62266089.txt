Ingredients:
1 package of frozen French fries
2 Cups Cheddar Jack Comb. cheese, shredded
1/4 lb bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/4 Cup jar jalepenos
2 tablespoons jalepeno liquid
ranch dressing
salt and pepper

Directions:
Cook your French fries according to the package directions.  Meanwhile cook bacon and crumble.
When your fries are done salt and pepper them; arrange in an oven proof dish or skillet (I use my cast-iron) and sprinkle with half of the cheese.  Sprinkle with jalepenos and bacon and the rest of the cheese.  Sprinkle a few tablespoons of the jalepeno liquid over them.  Place under the broiler until cheese is melted 3-5 minutes.
Serve with ranch dressing.

Description: 
We had these at a local restaurant and my son begged me to take him back just for those fries, instead I tried re-creating them and he claims they're just as good!...
