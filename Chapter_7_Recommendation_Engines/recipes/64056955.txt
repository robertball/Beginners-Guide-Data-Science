Ingredients:
2 1/2 c. diced plum tomatoes (about 5-6)
1/2 c. fine-diced red onion
1/4 c. fresh chopped cilantro
1 small jalapeño, finely minced
1 clove garlic, finely minced
Juice of 1 lime
1/2 tsp. sea salt

Directions:
Carefully dice the plum tomatoes. An easy method is to quarter the tomatoes and then cut each quarter in half, as shown in the photo above. Remove the membrane and any excess seeds. Then, dice into small bite-sized pieces.
In a medium bowl, add all of the pico de gallo ingredients and toss well to combine. Taste and add additional salt, if needed.
Transfer to a serving dish and enjoy with your favorite chips! It’s also the perfect addition to your favorite Tex-Mex-style recipes, and can be used as the base for making the best guacamole in town!
