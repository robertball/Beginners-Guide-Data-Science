Ingredients:
3/4 cup ketchup
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 (3/4 inch) thick pork chops

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine the ketchup, water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside half of the sauce.
Preheat broiler.
Brush both sides of the chops with sauce. Place chops on broiling pan rack. Broil about 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes on each side. Brush with more sauce.  Continue broiling, turning and basting every 3 to 4 minutes, until juices run clear.  Serve with reserved sauce.
