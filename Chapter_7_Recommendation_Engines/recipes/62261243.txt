Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
6 oz mushrooms, finely chopped
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 bay leaves
1/4 tsp dried basil
1/4 tsp dried oregano
2 cups beef or vegetable broth
4 cups water
1 box Da Vinci Ravioletti
4 cups tender spinach
3 Tbsp basil pesto
Shaved or grated parmeggiano-reggiano, for topping

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat.  Add the onions and garlic, saute for 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, saute for 5 minutes more.  Stir in the tomato paste, the bay leaves, and the dry herbs.  Stir and cook for about 1 minute.  Add the broth and water.  Bring to a boil.  Add the ravioletti, reduce the heat slightly, and cook at a slow boil for about 15 minutes, until tender.  (You will have to monitor the pot to keep it boiling but not over-boiling.) Stir in the spinach, and stir over the boil until fully wilted.  Remove from heat.  Stir in the pesto.  Ladle into bowls and top with the parmeggiano-reggiano.
