Ingredients:
3 - 16 oz. frozen black eye peas
1 smoked turkey leg
3 beef hot links or smoked sausages (diced)
1/4 cup finely chopped onions
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon season salt
1 teaspoon sugar
Water

Directions:
Boil turkey leg, hot links, onions, salts and pepper in approx 6 cups of water (enough to cover the meat) for 1 hour or until meat is tender.
Add black eye peas.
The water level should cover the peas completely. If the water has boiled down, add more to the pot to give yourself approx 1 inch ABOVE the peas.
Bring the peas to a rapid boil, then cover and simmer for an hour (or until the peas are tender and have begun to pop open.)
Break the turkey meat from the bone.
Mixture should have a slight creamy texture.
Add sugar at the end, remove cover and simmer until everything thickens (stirring frequently).
