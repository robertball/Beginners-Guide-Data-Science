Ingredients:
2 pounds dried pinto beans
8 cups water, or more if needed
1 small onion, chopped
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 smoked turkey leg
1/3 cup olive oil

Directions:
Wash and pick over the beans,  then place them in a large bowl. Fill the bowl with cold water, and soak the beans for 6 to 8 hours.
Drain and rinse the beans, then place into a slow cooker. Pour in 8 cups of water. Stir in onion, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and bay leaves. Place the turkey leg into the cooker, cover, and cook on Low setting for 6 hours. Stir in olive oil, and add more water if the beans are beginning to dry out; cook until the beans are very tender, an additional 2 hours.
