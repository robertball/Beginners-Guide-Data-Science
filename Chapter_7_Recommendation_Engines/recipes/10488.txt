Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup peanut butter
1 1/3 cups packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/3 cup water
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 cups quick cooking oats
1/2 cup wheat germ
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets or line them with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until creamy. Beat in eggs and water.
Mix together flours, oats, wheat germ, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda. Mix into peanut butter mixture. Stir in raisins or dates (see Cook's Note). Drop by ice cream scoopfuls  2 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Flatten slightly.
Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
These cookies are a delicious and hearty alternative to doughnuts or pastries. Also great to pack in lunches and on trips. Try one with your morning coffee or tea. For a slightly richer treat, use buttermilk in place of the water. Substitute dates for the raisins, if you prefer.
