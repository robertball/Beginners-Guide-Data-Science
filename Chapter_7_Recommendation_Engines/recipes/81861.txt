Ingredients:
1 head broccoli, chopped
2 teaspoons fresh ginger
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil, or canola

Directions:
Peel the ginger root with a sharp knife.  Add the peels to the water used to steam the broccoli.  Steam the broccoli to your desire of doneness (typically 3-4 minutes).  Do not over-cook.
Meanwhile, grate the ginger.  Whisk together the ginger, oil, soy sauce and vinegar.
When the broccoli is done, drizzle the ginger vinaigrette over the broccoli and serve.
