Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup half-and-half cream
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and set aside.
Mix flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and Cheddar cheese together in a large bowl. Whisk in half-and-half cream, milk, and vegetable just until blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
