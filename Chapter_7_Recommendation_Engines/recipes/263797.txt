Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box penne pasta
1/4 cup olive oil
1 bell pepper, cut into strips
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
Cheese Sauce:
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small cubes
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup shredded Gouda cheese
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute pepper, onion, and garlic for 3 minutes. Add steak and Italian seasoning. Saute until steak begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes more. Add remaining olive oil. Drain penne and mix into the skillet.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk in flour; continue cooking and stirring until a paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add evaporated milk and garlic, stirring constantly until sauce is homogenous. Add Cheddar cheese and Gouda cheese by handfuls; continue stirring until completely melted, about 5 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and drizzle over the pasta.
