Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups shredded cooked chicken
¾ cup crumbled blue cheese
⅓ (8 ounce) package cream cheese
¼ cup hot sauce, or more as needed
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated thin crust pizza dough (such as Pillsbury(<sup>&reg;</sup>))

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Mix chicken, blue cheese, cream cheese, and hot sauce together in a bowl.
Unroll pizza dough onto the baking sheet and spread chicken mixture in a line down the center of the dough. Wrap dough around chicken mixture, tucking and pinching the seams together.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let stromboli cool for a few minutes before slicing.
