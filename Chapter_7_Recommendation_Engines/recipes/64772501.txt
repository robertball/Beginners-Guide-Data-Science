Ingredients:
1 10-oz package extra sweet frozen corn kernels
1 tsp olive oil
Dash of chili powder
Dash of salt
Dash of TrueLime powder (or lime juice) - optional
Mayonnaise - optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
Spread frozen corn on a baking sheet.  Add 1 tsp of olive oil and mix well.  Sprinkle chili powder on corn to taste.
Bake for 5 minutes, stir, another 5 minutes, and stir.  Continue baking in 5 minute increments until it is the texture you'd like (I liked it at 10 minutes, but I preferred it when I cooked it for 15 minutes and it got slightly browned and crispy)
Remove corn from oven and pour into a serving bowl.  Sprinkle with a little TrueLime powder (or lime juice) - better to do a little bit and add more later, since the lime flavor can get strong quickly.  Add a tiny bit of mayo (about 1tsp) and a dash of salt.  Stir in the lime juice and mayo - the corn should be very lightly coated with the mayo and still look very yellow - mayo is just to add a bit of flavor.
