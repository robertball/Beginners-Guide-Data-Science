Ingredients:
4 McIntosh apples
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 teaspoons butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Remove cores and seeds of apples, leaving the bottoms intact. Place into an 8x8-inch casserole or baking dish. Place 1 teaspoon butter and 1 teaspoon cinnamon into each cored apple.
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are softened, 20 to 25 minutes, watching to make sure they don't pop.

Description: 
These baked apples are a favorite that my mom made every time fresh apples were in season; my favorite for this recipe are McIntosh. Great with pears too!
