Ingredients:
½ c Vegetable oil
¼ c White wine vinegar
¼ c Lemon juice
¼ c Water
2 T Grey Poupon Dijon mustard
2 T Honey
1 tsp Basil
1 tsp Oregano
1 tsp Thyme
½ tsp Onion powder

Directions:
Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend very well, about 1 minute.  I usually use this to marinate 1-2 lbs. of boneless chicken breast.  Any cut of chicken would work, or a whole pork tenderloin, or pork chops.  Marinate the meat at least 1-2 hours, the longer the better.  Set aside some of the marinade to brush on while grilling.
