Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/2 cup seltzer
1/2 cup melted shortening
1 cup matzoh meal
1 cup sliced red cabbage
2 teaspoons finely minced dill (or rosemary)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 quarts chicken broth

Directions:
In large bowl, whisk eggs till well mixed. Add seltzer and melted shortening to combine.
Whisk in matzoh meal and stir till combined (no lumps).
Add minced dill , kosher salt and pepper to taste and mix to will combined.
Cover bowl, set aside and chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile bring to boil chicken broth in a large pot (add red cabbage slices last 5 minutes of cook time.) Remove matzoh ball mixture from refrigerator and using a wet melon ball scoop, scoop 1 inch balls and drop into boiling broth.
* (note if you prefer rounder and firmer matzoh balls, roll in wet hands before dropping into broth).
Once all matzoh balls are in broth, boil for approximately 20 minutes.
Serve placing a single matzoh ball on appetizer spoon with a dash of broth and garnish with some red cabbage sliced and fresh dill
*(note - I like a little heat so add a dash of Frank's Red Hot sauce for a little bite)

Description: 
Matzoh ball soup should be made year round.  It's comfort soup for the soul when you need that jolt from your mum's love. I serve as an appetizer sometimes because a bite of love and comfort food is all you need to remind you that you are blessed and watched over...it is a chicken soup for the soul.  That said....I know you could cheat using a box mix , but don't do it ! You will appreciate the homemade....just saying.
