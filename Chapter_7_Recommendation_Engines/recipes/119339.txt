Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 cups canned cooked pumpkin
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup chopped dates
CARAMEL FROSTING:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes)
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon maple flavoring
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and brown sugar. Add pumpkin; mix well. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; gradually add to pumpkin mixture. Stir in pecans and dates.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until firm.
Meanwhile, for frosting, combine the butter, brown sugar and milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly; boil for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in maple flavoring and vanilla. Cool slightly; beat in enough confectioners' sugar to achieve spreading consistency. Remove cookies to wire racks; frost while warm.

Description: 
These family favorites taste so good, it's hard to eat just one! They freeze and travel well, especially if you let the icing completely dry, then layer the cookies between sheets of waxed paper.
