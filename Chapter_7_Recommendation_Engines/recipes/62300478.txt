Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup nopalina
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dried raisins
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup apple sauce
1/3 cup milk
1 tablespoons cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, oats, nopalina, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and raisins. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl, beat egg until frothy, and stir in melted butter, apple sauce and milk. Pour into the well, and mix to create a soft dough. Pat dough into two 1/2 inch thick circles. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Score 8 wedges into each circle of dough.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until risen and browned. Split wedges, and serve warm.
