Ingredients:
2-3 lbs center cut pork rib chops (with bone)
1 1/2 cups bottled margarita mix
2-3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Put everything into a large (gallon sized) freezer bag. Add your pork chops - about 2 to 3 lbs of the Center Cut Pork Rib Chops.  Be careful the bones don't puncture the bag.  Put in the fridge overnight.  TIP:  Make up another bag with all the same ingredients and freeze it!
When ready to cook, turn on your oven broiler to hi and let pre-heat a few minutes.  Remove chops from marinade and place on foil lined baking sheet. Brush with extra marinade.  Place chops under the broiler for 5 minutes (Be sure to leave your oven door ajar because you are broiling, and WATCH these closely!), then remove from oven and turn over - baste again then back in the oven they go for another 5 minutes under the broiler with the oven door ajar.  Throw out the rest of the marinade.  Check the temp - if they are 140 degrees remove them and let rest 10 mins. If not ready, turn over again - put back in oven until they are at least 140 degrees. Let rest about 10 minutes before serving.  These are also delicious cooked on a grill too!
