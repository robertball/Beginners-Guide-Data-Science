Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, melted
1 cup sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla extract
2-1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 cup ground pecans or walnuts
1 tsp. baking powder
1 jar Nutella (hazelnut-cocoa spread)

Directions:
1. Set the oven at 350 degrees.  Line two baking sheets with Silpat tray liners or foil, shiny side down.
2. In a bowl, beat melted butter, sugar, and brown sugar.  Add the eggs one at a time, and the vanilla.
3. Stir in oats, ground pecans, and baking powder.
4. Drop the batter (1 tsp. only) onto prepared sheets, spacing them 3 inches apart.  Batter will spread out very thin while baking.
5. Bake for 6-8 minutes, watching very carefully.  Take cookies out as soon as the edges start to brown.  They will finish baking on the tray as they cool and harden.  Cool completely before removing from tray.
6. Choose two cookies the same size.  Spread Nutella very thinly on one half and sandwich the other half on top.  Continue until all cookies are paired and filled.  Store in an airtight container so cookies stay crispy.

Description: 
This is a delicious sandwich cookie.  My mom's recipe originally called for a layer of semi-sweet chocolate in between two lace cookies, but I decided to try Nutella instead and LOVE the result!
