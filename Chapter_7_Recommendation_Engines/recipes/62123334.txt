Simple-ly Homemade Pasta Sauce (with a kick!) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 vines (30-35) Cherry sized Tomatoes (found in most grocery produce sections - can be substituted for grape tomatoes, just increase amount)
3 Shallots, minced
1 Tbs. Butter
1 Tbs. Olive Oil
Pinch of Kosher Salt
10 Whole Peppercorns
1/2 Tsp. Cayenne Pepper (according to taste)
Optional Ingredients: Chicken, Beef or Shrimp

Directions:
In a medium Saute pan, Melt the butter and add the peppercorns, olive oil, kosher salt and shallots.
Cook until shallots are soft (5 minutes).  Add water 1 Tbs. at a time to avoid drying out or caramelization.
Cut tomatoes in half and add directly to the hot pan.
Add Cayenne Pepper. If you like it spicy, add the whole 1/2 Tsp.  Taste it before adding all of the Cayenne - you can always add more but you cannot take it back once you have added it.
Cover and simmer on medium, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have cooked and have become like a sauce.
If you are adding chicken, beef or shrimp, cook separately.  Chicken should be cut into small pieces or strips before being stirred into the pasta.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I threw together the other day and had my family raving about! It is great over any type of pasta and the spice-factor can easily be adjusted according to taste.  Try it and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!
