Description: 
East Africans love a simple, nutritious breakfast that will get them, and keep them, going. That means save for a few pieces of fruit, some (tomato) jam, or some juice, breakfasts are virtually free of added sugar - unlike continental or American breakfasts. Try this extraordinary savory French toast recipe instead. You'll love it.
