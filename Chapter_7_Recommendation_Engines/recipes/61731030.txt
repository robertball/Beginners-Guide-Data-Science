Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
4 medium carrots, split lengthwise and cut in 2-inch pieces
1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, quartered
2 heads fennel, quartered
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Crush garlic with rosemary, salt and pepper, making a paste. Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press the garlic paste into the openings. Rub the meat with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil.
Place pork loin into oven, turning and basting with pan liquids. Cook 45 minutes.  Add the vegetables and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and salt and pepper to taste. Continue to roast until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1-1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove roast and vegetables to a platter. Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom.  Serve with pan juices.

The rosemary flavor and fragrance is even more pronounced in this healthier version of Kathleen's recipe, because we used fresh rosemary rather than dried. We also added fresh carrots, potatoes, and fennel for a delicious and healthy meal!Modified from: Roasted Pork Loin
