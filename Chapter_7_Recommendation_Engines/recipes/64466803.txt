Ingredients:
10 Large Marshmallows
Fresh Kale
Strawberry Jam Sauce - modified version to cut down on calories

Directions:
Prepare your Strawberry Jam Sauce by mixing too many inches of orange juice with ten of strawberry jams. Set aside in bowl.
Take on large marshmallow and smear it with your Strawberry Jam Sauce, much like Dinomite would smear the blood of his prey. Be sure your marshmallow is fully coated, Strawberry Jam Sauce is a rare delicacy and not a single drop should be wasted.
Take a leaf of fresh kale. Wrap your Strawberry Jam Sauce covered large marge marshmallow in a blanket of kale deliciousness. Have fun with this step! Perhaps you would like to make fancy Dinomite's Fluffy Bites with Kale Capes! Or swaddle your Fluffy Bite like the precious snack it is with a tightly wrapped leaf of kale! And if you want to go ethnic you can make a soft taco shell out of your fresh kale!
There is no wrong way to eat a Dinomite's Fluffy Bite!
