Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup ground cinnamon
salt and pepper to taste
Cayenne pepper, to taste
2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup EVOO
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh jalapeno peppers OR 2 TB chopped pickled jalapeno slices
2 limes, juiced
1 bunch of cilantro, chopped
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces.  Mix together cinnamon, salt and pepper and cover chicken in mixture. Arrange in another baking dish, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Cool and shred.
While chicken is cooking, spray another baking dish with cooking spray then place potatoes in. Drizzle with about 1/2 the oil, and season with salt and cayenne pepper (to your taste). Bake 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until tender.
Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute onion and garlic until tender. Mix in shredded chicken, jalapeno, and lime juice. Cook until heated through.  Add chopped cilantro right before removing from pan.
Serve the chicken and potatoes in warmed tortillas.
