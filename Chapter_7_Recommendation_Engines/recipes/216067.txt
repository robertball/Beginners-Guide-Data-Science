Description: 
I wanted to make something using orange and black colors for Halloween, and came up with sweet potato, black bean and cheese quesadillas. These wedges are comfortingly good at any time of year, but especially cute for Halloween! My kids love them plain...I love them with my spicy cilantro salsa!
