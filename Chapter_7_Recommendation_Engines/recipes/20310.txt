Description: 
My sister's friend gave her this recipe years ago to use at our parents' 25th wedding anniversary party.  We never had a name for it other than Aileen's Punch!  This is very refreshing and so easy to put together. I recommend making an ice ring out of extra pineapple juice or apricot nectar.
