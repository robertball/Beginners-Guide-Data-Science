Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup baby carrots
4 cubes chicken bouillon
1 cup water

Directions:
Place pork in the slow cooker and sprinkle with garlic. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and bouillon cubes around pork. Add water.
Cover and cook on Low until pork is slightly pink in the center and potatoes are tender, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is so easy - just one dish to complete an entire meal. The pork and potatoes melt in your mouth! We also like to buy a seasoned tenderloin for a special meal, just follow the same directions and omit the garlic. My family loves this meal, especially my two small children.
