Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, skin & bone removed
1 tablespoon lemon pepper
1 tablespoon parsley, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
plain flour
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
salt & pepper
cooking oil for shallow frying
3 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
1. In a clean resealable bag, pour in breadcrumbs, parsley and lemon pepper. Mix well and set aside.
2. Butterfly each chicken breast by slicing from the side without cutting through, so that the two halves are then opened flat to resemble a butterfly shape.
3. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Coat all the butterflied chicken breasts with flour, then eggs and breadcrumbs in that order. Coat the poultry with egg and breadcrumbs again to obtain a better coating.
4. Heat a frying pan with enough oil for shallow frying. Add in the prepared schnitzels and allow them to brown before turning. Drain oil off the schnitzel on a paper towel for 5 minutes.
5. In a small bowl, mix together the lemon juice, mayonnaise and Dijon mustard. Top the schnitzels with the mayo mixture.
