Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, drained
1 teaspoon dried basil, crumbled
salt and pepper to taste
12 ounces spaghettini
2 cups diced, cooked chicken breast meat
15 leaves fresh spinach, cleaned
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent.
Stir in broth and tomatoes; sprinkle basil into sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 15 minutes over medium-low heat.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and place pasta into serving bowls.
Place cooked chicken in sauce to heat through; drop in spinach just before serving to cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Spoon sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a copy-cat recipe I created from a restaurant in the Bay Area.  It's a soupy sauce, not a thick one.  It's a nice change.
