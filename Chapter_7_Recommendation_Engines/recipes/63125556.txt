Ingredients:
1 package dry yeast
1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons shortening
1 each egg
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 1/4 cups flour, divided

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl.
Add sugar, shortening, egg, salt, and half the flour; beat at low speed of electric mixer until smooth.
Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.
Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk, or cover and refrigerate up to 5 days.
Punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 4 or 5 times.
Shape and bake at 400 degrees for 12 - 15 minutes, or until golden brush with melted butter.
