Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (24 ounce) jars prepared pasta sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, garlic, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano into ground beef mixture.
Ladle a generous layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a slow cooker; add a layer of ravioli. Ladle another layer of meat sauce over ravioli layer; alternate with remaining ravioli and meat sauce until all ingredients are used.
Cook on Low for 3 to 5 hours. Sprinkle ravioli mixture with mozzarella cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted, 45 minutes to 1 hour more.

Description: 
A fantastic way to enjoy lasagna without all the fuss! I thought using frozen ravioli already filled with cheese instead of layering layers of noodles and cheese would make a great dish so easy. It all comes together; just scoop it out, serve with a salad, and enjoy.
