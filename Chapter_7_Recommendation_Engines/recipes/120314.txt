Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds orange roughy or other whitefish fillets
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Cut fillets into four pieces if necessary; set side. In a bowl, combine the orange juice, ketchup, oil, soy sauce, lemon juice and pepper; mix well. Remove 1/4 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Pour remaining marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add fillets. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 2 hours, turning once or twice.
Drain and discard marinade. Place fillets on a broiler pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 5-6 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork, basting occasionally with reserved marinade. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Description: 
'This recipe--from a seafood cookbook my husband bought me before we were married--is a longtime favorite,' writes Robin Guth of Endicott, New York. 'I have literally won out the page it's printed on.' The citrus-flavored fillets are broiled to a golden brown...then topped with toasted sesame seeds for a fun crunch.
