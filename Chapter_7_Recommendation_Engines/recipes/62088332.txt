Ingredients:
Grilled and Sliced Chicken Breast - 1 large or 2 medium grilled breasts total
Sliced Mushrooms - 1 cup
Diced Green Onions - 1/2 cup
Chopped Sun Dried Tomatoes - 1/2 cup
Favorite Alfredo Sauce - 16oz jar
Grated Romano or Parmesan Cheese - 1/4 cup
Cayenne Pepper - 1/4 tsp or to taste (can be omitted if you prefer regular chicken alfredo)
Salt & Pepper as needed
Penne/Mostaccioli Pasta - half of a 1lb. box or package

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.
While pasta is cooking, in a large hot sauté pan melt butter and add mushrooms, green onions and sun dried tomatoes. Sauté ingredients until veggies are tender.  Add cooked chicken and saute until hot.
Add Alfredo sauce and Romano cheese. Bring sauce to a low simmer and add Salt & Pepper and cayenne to taste.
Add pasta to sauce mixture.  Toss all ingredients with pasta and serve.
** A great alternative to this is to add peeled and de-veined shrimp (about 5 per person).  Add at the same time as the chicken and cook until the shrimp is pink and the chicken has been heated through, then continue with remaining steps.
** Other great additions/substitutions such as peas, broccoli, spinach, bacon/pancetta, etc., go well with this recipe, too.
