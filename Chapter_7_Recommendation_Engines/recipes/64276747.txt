Ingredients:
1 Onions
1 Bell Peppers
1 Cloves of Garlic
1 Head of Cabbage
1 lb ground pork or beef
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Tbsp Tony’s
½ - 1 can Rotel
3 Tbsp real butter

Directions:
* Cut cabbage into pieces approximately 2”x2” squares.
* Heat Oil; brown onions, bell peppers, & garlic in a large pot
* Season with Tony's (if you're not using Tony's, extra salt may be necessary since Tony's has more salt than other alternative seasonings).
* Once the meat is browned, do not drain, and top it with the cut cabbage
* Empty 1/2 - 1 can of Rotel on top of the cabbage
* Cover & lower the heat to medium
* Cook about 15-20 minutes; do not stir!
* Uncover; the cabbage should be nice and wilted
* Stir, taste, and make your own decision.  You may want more seasoning, or may want to cook it longer.
