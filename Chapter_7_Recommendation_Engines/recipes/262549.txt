Title:
Not Your Grandma's Chopped Chicken Liver Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 large onion, halved and sliced
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 pound chicken livers - rinsed, trimmed, and patted dry
2 fluid ounces bourbon
3  hard-boiled eggs, peeled
1 teaspoon ground thyme
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sugar, stir, and saute until onions are softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Transfer onions to a food processor, leaving as much butter in the pan as you can.
Fry livers in the hot butter until lightly browned on 1 side, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue frying until slightly pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes more. Add livers to the food processor with the onions.
Pour bourbon into the same skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Boil until thickened and reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Pour liquid into the food processor.
Combine eggs, thyme, salt, and pepper in the food processor with the liver mixture. Process until smooth.

Description: 
After working this recipe for years, it's finally ready to share. Suspect even those who don't enjoy liver might change their minds after tasting this on homemade crackers, toast, or bagels. I like it for light summer lunches or as an appetizer. The reduced bourbon/vermouth deglazing step adds an adult zing that rocks my world. Garnish with fresh herb sprigs or cucumber slices.
