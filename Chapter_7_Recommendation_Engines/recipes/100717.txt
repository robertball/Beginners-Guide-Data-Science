Ingredients:
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
6 chicken thighs
6 chicken drumsticks
1/4 cup olive oil
4 (4 ounce) sweet Italian sausages, halved
1 large onion, diced
3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup dry red wine
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes

Directions:
Mix poultry seasoning, salt and pepper with flour. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour and set aside. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; when wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan add chicken and sausages and cook in 2 batches, turning once, until well browned, about 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate; set aside.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil and add onion, carrots, mushrooms, garlic,  rosemary and thyme to the hot skillet; cook until vegetables are soft and golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in wine and tomatoes then arrange chicken and sausage over the vegetables. Simmer covered until chicken is cooked through and flavors deepen, about 30 to 35 minutes. Adjust seasonings, including salt and pepper, to taste. Serve.
