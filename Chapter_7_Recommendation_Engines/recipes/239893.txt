Ingredients:
¼ cup onion, diced
1 tablespoon bacon grease
3 cups 1-inch potato chunks
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
1 cup milk
3 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 ½ cups shredded cooked chicken

Directions:
Heat bacon grease in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot grease until soft, about 4 minutes.
Stir potato chunks with the onion. Pour chicken broth and water over the potato mixture. Bring the liquid to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour into the butter and cook, stirring constantly, until completely moistened, about 1 minute. Pour milk into the saucepan while continuing to stir; cook until thickened, about 3 minutes more. Sprinkle cheese over the milk mixture; cook and stir until the cheese is melted smoothly into the mixture, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Stir the cheese mixture and cooked chicken into the liquid in the stockpot; cook just until the chicken is heated through, about 4 minutes.
