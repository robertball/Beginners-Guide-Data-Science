Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rolled oats, quick or old fashioned1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour3/8 cup brown sugar, packed1/2 tsp baking soda1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter1 1/2 cups jam, we prefer strawberry

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Line a 9x9 pan with parchment paper, make sure it extends beyond the edge of the pan for easy removal.In a bowl cream together the butter, peanut butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.Fold in rolled oats, whole wheat flour and baking soda.Reserve 1 1/4 of rolled oat mixture for topping, press the remainder of rolled oat mixture into the pan, I use a potato masher to make sure it is pressed in firmly.Spread jam over base, sprinkle reserved 1 1/4 cups of orolled oat mixture over jam, press down lightly.Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly.Cool on a wire rack, then place in the fridge or freezer to firm the bars up for easier slicing.The bars freeze well for after school snacks.
