Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) loaf French baguette
1 1/2 cups spinach - packed, rinsed and torn
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 cups finely chopped almonds
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 clove garlic, minced
salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped tomatoes
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange the bread slices on a non-stick cookie sheet.
In an electric blender or food processor combine the spinach, Parmesan, almonds, basil, garlic, salt and pepper. Blend until a paste forms. Pulse in 2 tablespoons olive oil; continue pulsing until the mixture is the consistency of soft butter.
In a small mixing bowl combine chopped tomatoes, green onion and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir.
Bake the bread slices for 5 minutes or until crisp and brown.
Arrange toast on a serving platter. Spread each piece of toast with a thin layer of the blended pesto, then top with the tomato mixture.

Description: 
This Italian appetizer made of bread, fresh spinach, and some other goodies is great for serving at parties. A French baguette is a long, narrow loaf of French bread. I like to garnish the bruschetta with more basil.
