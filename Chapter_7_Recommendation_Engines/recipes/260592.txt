Ingredients:
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or as needed
2 ripe bananas
2 eggs
2 tablespoons raw honey
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 scoop chocolate protein powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup almond milk
2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 6-cup muffin tin with coconut oil.
Place bananas, eggs, honey, pumpkin, oats, coconut flour, protein powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and almond milk in a blender in that order. Blend, pausing to scrape down the sides of the blender, until batter is thick and well combined. Spoon batter evenly into the muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 30 minutes. Top with pumpkin seeds. Let cool briefly; remove from tin and finish cooling on a rack.
