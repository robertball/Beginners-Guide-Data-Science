Ingredients:
6 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
6 stalks celery, chopped, leaves reserved
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cubes chicken bouillon
2 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives

Directions:
In a large pot, place the potatoes, celery and leaves, and onion. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Remove the celery leaves, and stir in the bouillon cubes until dissolved. Mix in the corn. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
Mix the chives into the pot, and continue cooking 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I made up this recipe when I had none of the ingredients I needed! Your family will love this one, and you'll be able to make something else while this is cooking. Great with breadsticks! Serve alone, with a dollop of sour cream, or some grated cheese and pepper.
