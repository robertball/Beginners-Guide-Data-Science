Ingredients:
2 Cups all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons VERY COLD butter
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup whole buttermilk
Nonstick cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)
Lightly spray a small baking pan with nonstick spray.
In a food processor or bowl, combine the dry ingredients.
Cut in the butter until it resembles course meal.
Mix in the buttermilk until just combined.
If it appears too dry, add a little more buttermilk.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board.
Pat the dough down gently until it's about 3/4" thick.
Fold dough about 5 times and pat down to around 3/4" thick.
Use a round cutter to cut out biscuits.
Place on greased pan touching for soft sides.  Separate for crustier sides.
Bake for 10 - 12 minutes until golden brown.
