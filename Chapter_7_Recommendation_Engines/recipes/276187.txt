Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed
3 frozen cranberries
1 fluid ounce cranberry-pomegranate juice (such as Ocean SprayÂ®)
1 fluid ounce orange juice
2 fluid ounces champagne

Directions:
Fill a small plate with 1/4 inch of water. Pour sugar onto a second small plate, making a depth of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Gently dip the rim of a champagne glass into the water. Raise the glass to allow excess water to drip off, then dip the rim into the sugar. Twist the glass to ensure the entire rim is coated. Discard remaining sugar.
Place cranberries in the bottom of the champagne glass. Add cranberry-pomegranate juice, orange juice, and champagne.
