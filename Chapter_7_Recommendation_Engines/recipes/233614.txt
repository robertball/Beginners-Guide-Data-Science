Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) fully cooked bone-in ham
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 (6 ounce) can apple juice
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place ham in a large roasting pan, cut-side down. Press brown sugar evenly onto ham. Pour apple into roasting pan and cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until ham is heated through, about 80 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let ham rest for 10 minutes before transferring to a serving plate. Pour remaining pan juices into a saucepan.
Combine flour and milk in a jar with a lid; shake until mixture is blended.
Bring pan juices to a boil. Slowly whisk flour mixture into the saucepan until gravy is thick, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Soooo many people have told me they have never had ham gravy. Boy, are they missing out. This is my favorite meal; baked ham with mashed potatoes and ham gravy. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.
