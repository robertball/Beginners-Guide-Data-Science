Ingredients:
Red Velvet Cake Mix
Filling:
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 stick butter, room temp
7 oz. jar marshmallow creme
1/2 tsp. vanilla
1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar

Directions:
Make red velvet cupcakes per box instructions and cool.
Filling Instructions: Melt chocolate chips.
Add butter, marshmallow creme, and vanilla to melted chocolate.
Beat with an electric mixer on low until well-blended, scraping sides of bowl.
Add sugar and beat on low to incorporate.
Increase speed to medium and beat for 1 minute or until light and fluffy. Filling will be thick.
Using a pastry bag and large round tip, push tip into cupcake and squeeze in filling.  After a few times, you will be able to "feel" how much to squeeze in.
Frost cupcakes with your favorite white frosting.
Sprinkle with green sugar or candy sprinkles.
Put a birthday candle in center with a gold foil star leaning against it.
Be sure to sing "Happy Birthday" to Jesus after explaining what each color symbolizes and before eating.
