Ingredients:
Sauce:
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 bay leaf
Meatballs:
1 pound ground beef
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti

Directions:
Mix together crushed tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and bay leaf for the sauce in a slow cooker.
Place ground beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic powder, parsley, Italian seasoning, and pepper for the meatballs in a large bowl. Mix gently, but thoroughly, with your hands until well combined. Form mixture into 1-inch meatballs. Drop into sauce in the slow cooker, stir, and cover.
Cook on Low until meatballs are cooked through, 4 to 8 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Just before meatballs and sauce are finished cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and serve with sauce and meatballs.
