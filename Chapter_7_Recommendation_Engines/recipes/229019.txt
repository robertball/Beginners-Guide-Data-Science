Ingredients:
1 (1 ounce) package hot Italian sausage links
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 turkey cutlets, cut into bite sized pieces
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 onions, chopped
8 cloves garlic
4 (15 ounce) cans white kidney beans (cannellini), rinsed and drained
3 (10.75 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 jalapeno peppers, chopped
2 whole jalapeno peppers (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Wrap the sausages in foil, place them on a baking sheet, and bake for 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in hot oil until evenly browned, about 5 minutes.
Season turkey with 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Add onions and garlic to the turkey; continue to cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour in the white kidney beans and chicken broth. Season with 1 tablespoon cumin and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
Mix in the chopped jalapeno and the whole jalapeno peppers, if desired. Remove the sausages from the oven and cut them into bite-sized pieces. Stir the sausage into the chili.
Cook the chili until the whole jalapeno peppers are tender and chili is thick, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
A family favorite vamp of chili from Grandma Cheryl! You MUST use a large cast-iron pan, or chili will not thicken as fast or as much! Can sub chicken breast for turkey cutlets. Jalapenos and hot sausage are optional, but add the most flavor if you're not scared of a little spice!
