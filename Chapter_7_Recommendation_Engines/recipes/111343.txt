Ingredients:
3/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons canola oil
1/3 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
4 hot dogs, cut into 1 inch pieces
Fiesta Dipping Sauce:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 1/2 tablespoons dry taco seasoning mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat two 12 cup muffin tins with nonstick cooking spray or line with paper liners.
In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, chili powder, cumin and garlic powder. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and oil.  Stir until well blended, then gently stir in the cheese. Drop a smal spoonful of the batter into the bottom of each muffin cup. Place a piece of hot dog on top of this batter. Fill cups with enough additional batter to cover the hot dog pieces.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until muffins are lightly browned and spring back when lightly pressed. Cool slightly before removing from the muffin pans. Serve warm with the Fiesta Dipping Sauce.
To make the Fiesta Dipping Sauce, whisk together the sour cream, mayonnaise and taco seasoning mix until smooth. Serve immediately.
