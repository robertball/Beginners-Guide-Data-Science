Ingredients:
2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles (flavor packets saved for another use) broken into pieces
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon peanut oil
3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen petite peas, thawed
1 jicama, peeled and diced
2 (8 ounce) cans water chestnuts, drained and diced
3 stalks celery, diced
3 green onions, chopped
1 cup cashew pieces

Directions:
Toast the dry ramen noodles in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Spread the noodles into a large mixing bowl to cool; set aside. Make the dressing by whisking the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Whisk in the peanut oil and sesame oil until blended and thick.
Combine the peas, jiciama, water chestnuts, celery, green onions, and cashews in the bowl containing the toasted noodles. Pour the dressing overtop, and toss to mix immediately prior to serving.

Description: 
This is a recipe my boyfriend's mom gave to me. I like to add the ginger because it gives it a nice zest. It's great for potlucks and you can adjust the seasoning to your taste. The cashews and toasted noodles add a terrific crunch!
