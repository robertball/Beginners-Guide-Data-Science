Ingredients:
Pasta noodles, fettucine, linguine, penne, or rotini
1 can cream of mushroom soup
2/3 cup milk or cream
2 cloves of garlic
1/8-1/4 tsp. black pepper
4 cups cut cauliflower
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into small chunks(optional)
2 tbsp. butter or oil for cooking

Directions:
Measure out enough pasta noodles for 4 servings and cook in salted water until done to your liking.  While noodles are cooking sautee chicken in butter or oil until only the center is still pink.  Add cauliflower and continue sauteeing until chicken is fully cooked and cauliflower has softened.  Remove chicken and cauliflower and set aside.  Whisk together cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 soup can of milk or cream, garlic and pepper and cook on a medium heat stirring often until sauce thick and bubbling.  Remove from heat and add pasta to sauce and mix until noodles are coated.  Chicken and cauliflower can be either served on top of the noodles or added to the sauce along with the noodles.  Serve and enjoy!
NOTE: This is a great vegetarian dish without the chicken.  Just add some fresh mushrooms and zucchini to go with the cauliflower.
