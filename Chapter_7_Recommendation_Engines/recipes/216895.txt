Ingredients:
1 pound unsalted butter

Directions:
Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, 5 to 7 minutes. Set the melted butter aside to cool slightly, then skim the foam off the top and discard. Allow the butter to solidify overnight. Drain off any liquid that collects at the bottom. Melt the butter in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl, and pour into individual bowls before serving.

Description: 
Best made a day ahead, this is a great complement to steamed king crab or broiled lobster tails. Any leftover butter can be frozen for future use.
