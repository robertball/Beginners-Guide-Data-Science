Description: 
MY HUSBAND and I grew up on plain hearty foods, and we both learned early on that simple food, well prepared, maintains good health.    I always felt I was giving my family the best when I prepared this dish. They loved the nutty flavor and chewy texture of the barley, and it was a delicious departure from rice as a side dish.             --Elaine Kremenak                                                             Grants Pass, Oregon
