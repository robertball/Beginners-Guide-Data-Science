Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 onion, minced
1 1/2 cups garbanzo beans, drained (reserve liquid) and rinsed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Bring the water and onions to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the onions are very tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, puree the garbanzo beans in a blender using as much of the reserved liquid as needed to achieve a smooth puree.  Stir the garbanzo puree into the onions along with the salt, basil, soy sauce, and poultry seasoning. Stir in the flour until incorporated, then use an immersion blender to blend the gravy until smooth.
Return the gravy to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover, and simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently.
