Ingredients:
2 - 4 dozen eggs

Directions:
1.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Position the oven racks in the center of the oven.
2.Place the eggs parallel to the bars on the racks.  (see picture below)
3.Place a baking sheet pan in the bottom of the oven (just in case an egg breaks).  I have never had a mess in my oven in all the times I have made this recipe.  I have had eggs break, but they cooked inside when they do so there is no mess
4.Bake for 30 minutes.
5.When the eggs are done, fill a large bowl with ice water and move the eggs into the bowl.  I do this a few minutes ahead of time to make sure the water is COLD!
6.Peel the eggs as soon as they're cool enough to handle, then return them to the ice water to thoroughly chill.  I think that the eggs are easier to peel if they are allowed to chill in the water for at least 10 minutes.  Also, I peel the eggs under cool running water.
This recipe works best with the freshest eggs you can find.
