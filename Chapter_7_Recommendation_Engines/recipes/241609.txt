Ingredients:
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
6 pork chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix paprika, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper together in a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge pork chops in the spice mixture to coat and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake chops in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
