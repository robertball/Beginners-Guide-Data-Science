Ingredients:
About 7 Cups of unbleached flour, divided
2 Teaspoons salt
2 Tablespoons sugar
1 package "RapidRise" yeast
1/2 Cup milk
3.5 Tablespoons buter, cut into pieces
1 1/2  Cups of water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350
Combine two cups of flour with other dry ingredients, in large mixing bowl
Combine water, milk and butter in microwave safe container, and heat on medium until buter is melted. (Do not boil!)
If liquid is too hot, allow to cool a bit (so you don't kill the yeast)
Add liquid to flour and stir, adding flour in 1/2 cup increments until dough is soft and pliable (Can be done with mixer, but I do it the old fashioned way)
Turn out on floured surface and knead. When smooth and elastic, cut in half.
Using the cut surface for the top of loaf, shape loaves and place into two well-greased 9 X 5 loaf pans, split top before rising
Let rise in warm place for about thirty minutes, or until dough has doubled in size.
Bake for thirty minutes, then turn up to 375 and bake for another twenty minutes. Bread should have a hollow sound when done.

Description: 
This is an adaptation of my Grandmother's basic white bread recipe. It took her half a day with two risings, but this only takes a little over half an hour before it goes in the oven!
