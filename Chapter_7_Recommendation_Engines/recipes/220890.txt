Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups mashed potatoes
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Cook and stir onion and garlic in the melted butter until onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Combine onion mixture, mashed potatoes, flour, eggs, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until well blended.
Scoop 1/4 to 1/2 cup batter (depending on size of waffle iron) into the center of waffle iron and close lid. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
Here's a quick and delicious way to use up those leftover mashed potatoes. You WILL need a waffle iron. These are basically potato pancakes (a.k.a. latkes) but without all the greasy clean-up and calories from pan-frying. I usually serve them with fish or chicken and sauteed apples.
