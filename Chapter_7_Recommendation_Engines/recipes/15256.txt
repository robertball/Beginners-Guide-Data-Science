Chruscik Recipe

Ingredients:
9 egg yolks
3 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until well blended. Add the sour cream, rum, and vanilla, mix until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time. Turn the dough out onto a heavily floured surface and knead vigorously for about 1/2 hour. Allow the dough to absorb as much of the flour as it can so it is no longer sticky.
Separate dough into 4 or 5 portions and roll out very thin. The dough should be almost as thin as paper, and slightly see-through. Cut dough into strips about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 inches long. Make a 1 1/2 inch slit in the strip closer to one end. Pull the long end of the strip through the slit.
Heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the cookies quickly, turning once. They should be golden but not brown. Drain on paper towels and dust with confectioners' sugar when cool.
