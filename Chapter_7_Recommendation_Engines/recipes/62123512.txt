Ingredients:
2 apples (Gala, Fuji, or other crisp sweet variety)
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 pork tenderloin (about 1 pound) cut into 1-inch chunks, or 1 pound pork stew meat, trimmed of fat
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper, freshly ground
1 tablespoon flour
1 (14 1/2 ounce) can chicken broth
1 pound red potatoes, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1 cup baby carrots
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
3 tablespoon honey-Dijon mustard
1 Tbsp. chopped parsley, fresh or dried

Directions:
Peel and core apples; cut each into 8 wedges. Set aside.
Heat oil in a 5-quart pot over medium-high heat. While oil heats, toss pork with salt, pepper, and flour. Cook pork 4 minutes until browned, turning once; remove to a plate.
Add broth, apples, potatoes, carrots, thyme, and basil to pot and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 12 minutes, or until potatoes are just tender.
Stir in mustard, parsley, and pork. Cover and simmer 4 minutes.
