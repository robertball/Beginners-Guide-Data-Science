Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant, cut into 1/4 inch rings
1 t. salt
2 cups bread crumbs
1 t. onion powder
1 t. garlic powder
1 t. italian seasoning
1/2 t. Cavender's Greek seasoning
1/2 cup Egg Beaters egg substitute
Cooking spray

Directions:
Place rounds of the cut eggplant onto a sheet pan with a cooling rack inside.  Sprinkle with the salt, turn and sprinkle with more salt.  Let sit for approximately 1/2 an hour to get some of the water out.
Meanwhile, mix bread crumbs with seasonings and preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
Dip the eggplant rounds into the Egg Beaters and then into the bread crumb mixture, covering both sides well.
Place back onto the rack inside the sheet pan and spray with cooking spray.  Flip, spray the other side.
Bake for about 15 minutes and then flip and bake for about 10 more minutes.
