Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
¼ cup peanut butter, divided
1  Asian pear, chopped - divided
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided
½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine two crescent roll triangles by overlapping the seams, creating a square. Repeat with remaining dough to form 4 squares total.
Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter in the center of each square; top each with pieces of Asian pear. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon atop pear slices; top with Cheddar cheese. Fold one corner of a square over to completely cover the fillings, creating a triangle; seal the edges together. Repeat with remaining squares. Arrange pear pockets on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake on the preheated oven until dough is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
My kids and I made up this recipe one day for lunch. The juxtaposition of the Cheddar, pears, and peanut butter is yummy and decently healthy for kids. I'm sure there are a dozen variations that would be equally delicious and quick, but this is what we had on hand that day!
