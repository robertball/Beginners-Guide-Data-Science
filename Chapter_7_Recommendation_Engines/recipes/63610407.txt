Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package Ronzoni Smart Taste Penne Rigata
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 15 oz cans cannelinni and/or kidney beans (drained)
1 cup chopped onion
1 poblano (or bell) pepper
1/2 cup white or red wine
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Heat oil in a large, deep skillet. Place beans, pepper, and onion in the skillet and cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Pour in wine, and cook for 1 minute, stirring, to deglaze the pan. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Toss with cooked pasta, and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle top with mozzarella.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
