Description: 
This soup has been in our family for 4 generations. Grandmother added the garlic, mom added Lawry's® seasoned salt, and I made it a puree. It's light and refreshing on a hot summer's day and decidedly 'cucumber!' Garnish with any or all of the following: chopped tomatoes, onions, parsley, or slivered almonds.
