Ingredients:
3 1/8 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1 cup unsalted butter
2 1/3 cups packed brown sugar
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups peanut butter chips
1 cup chopped pecans, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon (if desired); set aside.
In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Stir in the brown sugar until dissolved and remove from heat. Allow the mixture to cool. Beat eggs into the mixture one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Mix in the sifted ingredients one third at a time, mixing just enough to blend. Fold in peanut butter chips and pecans. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven for chewy blondies, or 35 to 40 minutes for drier, firmer blondies.  When done, you can either let them cool and cut into squares for serving, or you can scoop out a hot blondie and cover with vanilla ice cream for a real treat.

These are the absolute favorite dessert of my boyfriend and all his friends.  No tailgate, party or even dinner is complete without these gooey, peanut butter blondies.
