Ingredients:
1 pound breakfast sausage (mild or hot)
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup Ranch dressing (For best results use Hidden Valley mix made according to directions on pkg.)
2 tubes crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to temp on crescent roll package. Crumble and brown sausage in a skillet until cooked through, drain of grease; set aside. Unroll crescent dough and take apart into individual roll sections. Roll each section into a ball and flatten slightly. Cut each flattened piece in half equally. Roll each half into a ball and roll out flat using a rolling pin into a 3 to 4 inch circle. Place each circle into a muffin tin cup, fitting it down into bottom and up sides (It's ok if the sides don't reach the top of the tin cup sides.) Mix Ranch dressing in with the cooked sausage, then stir in 1 cup of each of the cheeses. Spoon mixture into crescent filled cups to fill up to top of crescent edges. Bake for 1o minutes. Sprinkle remaining cheeses on top and continue to bake another 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and crescents are golden brown.
