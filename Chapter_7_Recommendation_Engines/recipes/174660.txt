Ingredients:
4 cups cider vinegar
1 cup brown sugar
1 ⅓ cups ketchup
¼ cup butter
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco(<sup>&trade;</sup>))
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons mustard powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Place the vinegar, sugar, ketchup, butter, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, mustard powder, salt, and pepper into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 30 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Remove from the stove and pour into a heatproof bowl. Cover, and refrigerate the sauce for 2 days.
Strain the sauce through a mesh sieve to remove the red pepper flakes. Store the sauce in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
This is a Southern vinegar barbeque sauce with a splash of ketchup. I transfer some of the sauce to a plastic squeeze bottle for serving, and keep the rest in a glass quart jar in the refrigerator. Be sure to let the sauce come to room temperature before serving (you can warm it in the microwave if you want.)
