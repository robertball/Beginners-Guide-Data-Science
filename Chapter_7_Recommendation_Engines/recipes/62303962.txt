Ingredients:
Makes 6 servings
Ingredients:
1 teaspoon oil (canola or olive)
1 pound skinless chicken breast, cubed
1 medium onion, diced
4 carrots, peeled and sliced
1 pound red potatoes, cubed
2 teaspoons cumin
1-1/2 teaspoons red curry powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
4 teaspoons whole wheat pastry flour (you can use all purpose if you prefer)
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
1/4 cup non-fat Greek yogurt
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken and saute until cooked through. Set aside and cover.
Add onion and saute until tender. Add carrots and potatoes, stir. Add cumin, curry and cinnamon and stir in. Add flour and coat, cook for an additional minute.
Add stock, bring to a boil, stirring until thickened. Return chicken to the skillet. Reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are cooked, about 20 minutes.
Add peas and yogurt and stir in. Continue to simmer until heated through.
Serve with rice and naan.

Description: 
The curry was flavorful, with a mild heat, that didn't overwhelm the other ingredients. I especially love how just a hint of the cinnamon came through. If you like some real heat in your curry, I would increase the amount of cumin and curry powder you use. Making this dish all the better, one serving of the curry is only 205 calories with 2 grams of fat and 4 of fiber. I served it over Basmati rice.
