Ingredients:
Crust:
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup light butter
Filling:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/2 cup egg substitute
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated fresh lemon peel
1/4 cup reduced sugar raspberry preserves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8X8-inch baking pan generously with butter flavored nonstick spray.  Set aside.
To make crust: Mix together flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and salt in a medium mixing bowl.  Cut in light butter until the mixture is crumbly, like a streusel topping. Do not overmix.  Press dough into prepared 8x8-inch baking pan.  Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned.
To make filling:  Place SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and flour in a medium mixing bowl.  Stir well.  Add egg substitute and half-and-half. Stir until blended.  Slowly add lemon juice while stirring constantly.  Add lemon peel.
Stir raspberry preserves until they loosen up.  Spread evenly over warm crust.
Gently pour lemon mixture over preserves.  Bake in preheated oven 20-25 minutes or until set.   Remove from oven and allow to cool before placing in refrigerator.
Chill in refrigerator 2 hours before serving.
