Ingredients:
2 CUPS OF MUSTARD POWDER
1 CUP OF HONEY
2 1/2 CUPS OF CIDER VINEGAR
7 1/2 WHOLE EGGS SLIGHTLY BEATEN, (PRETTY MUCH BEAT THEM TOGETHER TILL THEY COMBINE WELL AND ALL THE YOLKS ARE BROKEN)
2 TABLESPOONS OF HORSERADISH POWDER

Directions:
STEP ONE- IN THE TOP OF A DOUBLE BOILER OVER SIMMERING/BOILING WATER COMBINE ALL THE INGREDIENTS STIRRING UNTIL VERY, VERY SMOOTH AND COMBINED. (I LIKE TO USE A METAL WHISK TO HELP BREAK DOWN THE MUSTARD POWDER)
STEP TWO- CONTINUE TO STIR FREQUENTLY AND HEAT FOR 10 MINUTES IN DOUBLE BOILER.
STEP THREE- USING A CANNING FUNNEL LADLE THE HOT HONEY MUSTARD INTO THE JARS YOU HAVE PICKED TO USE LEAVING 1/4 AN INCH OF HEADSPACE (THE SPACE BETWEEN THE MUSTARD AND THE LID ITSELF)
STEP FOUR- PUT LIDS AND RINGS ON EACH JAR AS YOU PUT IN THE MUSTARD, MAKE SURE YOU WIPE THE RIMS OF THE JARS WITH A DAMP CLEAN CLOTH  BEFORE YOU PUT THE LIDS ON.  CAUTION JARS AND LIDS WILL GET HOT!  PLACE JARS INTO A BOILING WATER BATH FOR 10 MIN, COMPLETELY SUBMERGE JARS, THEN PULL OUT AND ALLOW THEM TO COOL, THEN TEST LIDS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SEALED.
STORE IN A COOL DRY PLACE.
