Ingredients:
4 cooking apples
1 lemon
8 tbsp golden caster sugar
1 litre/1¾ pints ready-made vanilla custard
50g/2oz butter
4 dessert apples

Directions:
Put a medium sized oven tray in the freezer.
Peel, core and chop the cooking apples and add to a deep pan with the juice of a lemon and four tablespoons of golden caster sugar. You can even leave the squeezed lemons in the pan. Pop the lid on and bring to a simmer for 10 minutes. A bit of texture is welcome in the ice cream so don’t let the apples soften to a purée.
Tip the cooked apples into a large bowl, pour the ready-made custard over and fold together. Tip the mixture into the chilled tray and freeze for two hours, giving it a stir at the halfway stage.
When the ice cream is almost frozen, peel and core the dessert apples and cut into segments. Warm the butter in a frying pan and add the apples with the remaining four tablespoons of golden caster sugar. Turn them occasionally making sure that all the apples are evenly caramelised, which should take 10 minutes or so.
Serve the piping hot apple segments with the home-made apple ice cream.
