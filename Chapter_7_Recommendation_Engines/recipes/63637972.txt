Ingredients:
12 slices of bacon
10 eggs
1/4 milk
1/2 cup of cheddar cheese
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
1/4 cup green onions
1/4 cup jalape√±os
1/4 cup roasted red pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cook bacon slices for 1:15 in the microwave.
Spray muffin tin with cooking spray.
Place a slice of bacon in each muffin hole in a circle around the side.
Either scramble the eggs with the milk and fill each hole about 3/4 of the way or crack the egg directly into a muffin hole.
Evening disperse the green onions into four of the muffin holes.
Do the same with the roasted red pepper and the jalepenos.  Feel free to get creative here and use the flavors you enjoy.
Bake for 20 minutes if doing scrambled or 15 if doing whole depending on how you like your yokes on your eggs.
Remove from the oven, salt and pepper to taste, and add a small amount of cheese to each muffin.
Bake for 5 more minutes.
