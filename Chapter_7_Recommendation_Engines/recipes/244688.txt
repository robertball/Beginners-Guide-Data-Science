Ingredients:
2 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup
1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
½ cup half-and-half
⅓ cup white wine
⅓ cup mayonnaise
8  cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cream of mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese, and half-and-half in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring often. Remove saucepan from heat and stir white wine and mayonnaise, a little at a time, into soup mixture, stirring after each addition until white sauce is smooth.
Arrange chicken breasts side-by-side in a shallow baking dish. Pour white sauce over chicken and top with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and chicken is warmed, about 45 minutes.
