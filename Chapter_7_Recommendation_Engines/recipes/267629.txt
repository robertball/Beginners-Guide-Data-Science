2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 1/2 cups milk, divided
2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant banana pudding mix
5 small bananas, sliced, or more to taste
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed, divided

Add remaining 1/2 cup milk and coffee liqueur to the second bowl. Stir in chocolate pudding mixes until thickened. Fold in remaining 6 ounces whipped topping and graham crackers.
