1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup ground flax seed
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/3 cup canola oil
2/3 cup pure maple syrup

1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, mix the oats, pecans, walnuts, flax seeds and cinnamon. In a 2 cup measure, mix the canola oil, maple syrup, maple flavor and salt. Add to oat mixture and mix thoroughly. Spread evenly over the prepared baking sheet.
Bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool completely before breaking the granola into chunks. Store in an air-tight container.
