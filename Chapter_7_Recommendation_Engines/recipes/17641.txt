Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite size pieces
2 cups dry white wine, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  onion
1  green bell pepper, diced
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce

Directions:
To Marinate: Place chicken in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Pour 1 1/2 cups of wine over chicken, then sprinkle with garlic powder and onion powder. Cover and refrigerate to marinate for at least 1 hour.
Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and bell pepper for 5 to 7 minutes, or until soft. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Remove chicken from marinade, discarding any remaining marinade. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat and brown chicken, adding teriyaki sauce to 'sear'. Braise with remaining white wine and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
Add onion/bell pepper mixture to chicken and heat through, stirring. Serve hot.
