Ingredients:
3 cups elbow macaroni
6 slices thick-cut bacon
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed Cheddar cheese soup
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/4 cups milk
12 ounces cooked lobster tail meat, chopped
2/3 cup panko bread crumbs
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and dice.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stir Cheddar cheese soup, Cheddar cheese, and milk together in a bowl. Stir pasta, bacon, and lobster into soup mixture. Pour pasta mixture into a 2 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.
Mix bread crumbs and butter together in a separate bowl; sprinkle over pasta mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and bread crumbs are lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I've tried several variations of this recipe and this is by far my favorite. The creaminess of the cheese soup, the pungent flavor of the lobster, and smokiness of the bacon blend together in a lovely dish you can serve on a busy weeknight or at your next dinner party.
