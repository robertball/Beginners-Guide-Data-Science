Ingredients:
½ cup yellow cornmeal
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ cup buttermilk
⅔ cup vegetable oil
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups cooked white rice
¼ cup chopped red bell pepper
¼ cup chopped green bell pepper
¼ cup chopped red onion
½ head romaine lettuce - rinsed, dried and shredded
5 slices bacon
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, salt, black pepper and red pepper.
Pour buttermilk in a separate large bowl.
Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.
Dip the chicken in the buttermilk, then in cornmeal mixture. Coat lightly and cook in hot oil until crispy and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels; keep warm.
Combine the rice, red bell peppers, green bell peppers, onion, and chicken in medium bowl. Place lettuce on bottom of 4 servings bowls or plates. Top with rice and chicken mixture.
Prepare the dressing by placing the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Sprinkle crumbled bacon over chicken mixture.
Pour off all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Add 2 tablespoons water, cider vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper; heat just to boiling and pour over salad.
