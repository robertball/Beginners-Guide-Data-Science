Black Bean Burgers Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 14.5 oz. cans black beans
1/4 cup (or more) minced jalapenos
1 1/3 cups plain bread crumbs
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 small onion, diced
2 eggs, slightly beaten
2 T. cumin
2 T. chili powder
6 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup Liquid Smoke
1/4 cup Ranch dressing mix
olive oil for frying
8 slices smoked Gouda cheese

Directions:
Drain beans, but do not rinse. Also, it's okay to have a bit of liquid from the beans left. Mix beans and jalapenos in food processor.
In large mixing bowl, stir together beans, jalapenos, and all other ingredients, except for the cheese.
Place the mixture in the fridge for an hour or so; cold batter is easier to shape into patties.
Shape patties into desired size. Cook in olive oil on medium-high heat for about 5 minutes per side.
Serve with Gouda on top. I also suggest garnishing with mayo and a tomato slice.
