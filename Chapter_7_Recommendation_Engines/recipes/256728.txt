Ingredients:
Harissa Sauce:
1 roasted red pepper, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons chopped shallot
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint
1 teaspoon lime juice
3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pinch ground coriander
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
Mashed Beans:
2 cups canned cannellini beans
2 cups water, or as needed
2 teaspoons truffle oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Portobello Mushrooms:
4 large portobello mushroom caps
4 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix roasted red pepper, shallot, garlic, 1 teaspoon olive oil, mint, lime juice, Dijon mustard, cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon salt, red pepper flakes, coriander, 1 pinch black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl to make harissa sauce.
Combine cannellini beans and water in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Combine drained beans, 2 teaspoons truffle oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a food processor; puree until smooth.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Brush mushroom caps on both sides with 4 teaspoons olive oil; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Grill mushrooms, gill-side up, basting frequently with vegetable broth, about 4 minutes per side.
Top each mushroom cap with 1/2 cup bean puree and 2 tablespoons of harissa sauce.
