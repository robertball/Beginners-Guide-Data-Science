1/2 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
cayenne pepper to taste

Description: 
This is a wonderful, spicy chicken stew served over rice. I make it often for my husband and friends. It can easily be doubled to feed a crowd. It is an amazing African dish. I learned it from a good friend who was a missionary kid in Sierra Leone and Zaire. It can easily be modified for vegans by substituting vegetable broth and adding vegetables instead of chicken. Any fresh or frozen veggies that you have on hand can be added.
