Ingredients:
1 head romaine lettuce
2 cups Jasmine rice; steamed
400 ml coconut milk
1 tbsp sesame oil
1 kaffir lime peel; washed and julienned
2 tablespoons red curry paste
16 ounces chicken breast strips, sliced thin
1 fresh hot pepper; washed, seed, and julienned (optional)
1 medium zucchini, cut into zoodles
1 large carrot; cut into zoodles
100 grams baby corn; drained

Directions:
Prepare lettuce leaves by separating and washing each leaf thoroughly. Set aside.
Wish together the coconut milk and red curry paste until combined.
Heat a high-sided skillet or wok over medium heat.
Once warm, add oil. Once oil has warmed, add lime peel and saut√© for about 1 minute or until it starts to soften. Add chicken. Once the chicken is cooked thoroughly add vegetables and mix until they begin to sweat.
Add milk/curry mixture to the chicken and vegetables and simmer, uncovered, at low-medium heat stirring occasionally.
Arrange lettuce leaves on a serving plate, add some steamed rice to each leaf.
Continue stirring the chicken mixture until a thick sauce has been achieved. Remove from heat.
With a slotted spoon, arrange the chicken mixture on top of the rice on each leaf. Spoon a bit more sauce over each wrap. Top with julienned fresh pepper. Serve immediately.
