Ingredients:
24 Quail (I use Partial Boned with only legs still in)
Marinade:
1 Litre Dr. Pepper
1 Cup Pomegranite Juice
1 Cup Cranberry Juice
1 Shiner Bock Beer
3 Tbsp Minced Garlic
3 Tbsp Dried Minced Onion
6 Tbsp No Salt Italian Seasoning Blend Which is:
Basil
Thyme
Oregano
Marjoram
Rosemary
Savory
Sage
***
Glaze:
1 cup Dr.Pepper
1/2 cup Honey
1/2 cup Cranberry Juice
1/2 cup Pom Juice
1/2 bup Honey Mustard
3 TBSP Red Pepper Flakes

Directions:
Mix the Marinade up real good and then place the birds into a Very Large Zip Lock Bag and Marinate for at least 8 Hours turning it every two hours.
Once you are ready..Get the grill hot and Grill the Quail Thoroughly like Chicken with seasoning of choice until done and reduce heat (For grill seasoning, I like to use 'Kickin Chicken Blend' from Weber)
Begin to grill again at a reduced temp and patiently apply about 6 coats of this Glaze on the bird.
Make sure the bird is at a warm temp to serve and then mow it down!
