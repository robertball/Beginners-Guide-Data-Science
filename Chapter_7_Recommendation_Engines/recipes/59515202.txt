Description: 
This revision is all about the meatballs.  Make the sauce from the original recipe or use your favorite jarred sauce.  My husband now thinks ALL meatballs shoud be BBQed- these are that good.  Sometimes they don't make it to the spaghetti because people hover around the platter as I take them off the BBQ.Modified from: Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs
