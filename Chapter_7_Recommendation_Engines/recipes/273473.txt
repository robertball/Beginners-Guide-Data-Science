Ingredients:
3 (16 ounce) cans fat-free, reduced-sodium chicken broth, divided
3 pounds chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 cups chopped onions
6 cloves garlic, minced
3 (14.5 ounce) cans no-added-salt diced tomatoes, undrained
1 pound peeled, cubed red potatoes
1 ½ cups (1-inch thick) carrot slices
¼ cup tomato paste
3  drained chipotle peppers, finely chopped
1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Place 1/2 cup chicken broth, chicken, onions, and garlic in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until chicken starts to turn opaque, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour in remaining chicken broth. Add tomatoes, potatoes, carrot slices, tomato paste, chipotle peppers, cumin, and salt. Simmer until vegetables are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in cilantro and serve.

Description: 
This is a great fall or winter stew that I have been making for several years and is also very nutritious. It has a great Southwestern flavor with a spicy kick to it, and is very easy to throw together as it all cooks in one pot. It is also good topped with low-fat cheese and/or sour cream after serving into bowls. Serve with a salad, rolls, or tortilla chips.
