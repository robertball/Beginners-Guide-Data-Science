Ingredients:
16-ounce bag jumbo marshmallows
2 cups whole milk
2 cups chocolate ice cream (get the highest butterfat content possible)
1 tablespoon sour cream
3 tablespoons chocolate syrup
1/2 cup crushed graham crackers

Directions:
Heat the oven to broil. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Reserve 4 marshmallows for garnish. Spread the remaining marshmallows on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Place the sheet pan under the broiler and cook, stirring once or twice, until completely charred, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
Repeat with the remaining 4 marshmallows, but cook until just slightly golden, about 1 minute. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
In a blender, combine the milk, ice cream, sour cream and burnt marshmallows. Blend for 5 minutes.
Pour the chocolate syrup into a shallow bowl. One at a time, overturn four 8-ounce glasses and dunk in the syrup to coat the rims. Pour the milkshake mixture into the glasses and garnish each with one of the reserved toasted marshmallows and the crumbled graham crackers.
