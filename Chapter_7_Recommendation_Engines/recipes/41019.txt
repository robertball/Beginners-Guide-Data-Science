Ingredients:
1 loaf baguette-style French bread
1/2 (8 ounce) jar oil-packed dried tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped pitted kalamata olives
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese
4 ounces feta or goat cheese, crumbled
2 tablespoons milk
shredded fresh basil leaves

Directions:
For crostini, partially freeze bread. Cut bread into forty 1/4-inch-thick slices; arrange on cookie sheets. Drain tomatoes, reserving oil. Lightly brush one side of each slice with some oil. Bake in a 300 degree F oven for 6 minutes. Turn slices over; bake 6 minutes more or until golden brown.
Finely chop tomatoes. Stir in olives and garlic. Set aside. Beat cream cheese in a small mixing bowl until softened. Beat in feta and milk until smooth.
Spread feta mixture on oiled side of crostini. Top with a small dollop of tomato mixture. Garnish crostini with shredded basil.
