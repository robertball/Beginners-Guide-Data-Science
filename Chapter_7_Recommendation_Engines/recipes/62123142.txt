Ingredients:
1 litre natural unsweetened (preferably full fat) yoghurt
1 can condensed milk
2 tablespoons sliced almonds

Directions:
Place a coffee filter in a large strainer. Pour yogurt into the filter. Place in the refrigerator and allow to drain for about 8 hours or until it is the consistency of soft cream cheese.  Add the condensed milk to the strained yogurt and mix thoroughly. Grease a baking tin or a glass baking dish (8 inch round works well). Pour the mixture into the greased baking dish and bake at 180 degrees centigrade for about 30 minutes, or until the mixture is firm and the top is lightly browned. Take out of the oven, and sprinkle almonds evenly over the top. Cool, and serve sliced into wedges at room temperature.

Description: 
This is a light and tasty cheesecake like desert. This version is rediculously easy and was made for me by my friend Anu Choudhury in Mexico City.
