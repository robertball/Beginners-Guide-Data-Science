1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

16 sea scallops, rinsed and drained
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
4 teaspoons lemon juice, divided

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, oregano, thyme and lemon pepper. Roll scallops in flour mixture until lightly coated on all sides.
Heat olive oil in a skillet or frying pan over high heat. Add 4 scallops to the pan and sear on all sides (about 2 minutes for each side). After turning scallops, add 1 tablespoon parsley and 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Remove scallops from pan and place on a plate in the oven to keep warm until ready to serve.
Repeat until remaining scallops are cooked, tossing each batch with parsley and lemon juice.
