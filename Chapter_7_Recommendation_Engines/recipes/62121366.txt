Ingredients:
Cake:
1 box yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1 cup oil (I used canola)
1 small can mandarin oranges with juice

1 large carton cool whip
1 large can crushed pineapple with juice
1 small box instant vanilla pudding
Optional:
Marchino Cherries
Shredded Coconut

Directions:
Cake:
Combine the cake mix, eggs and oil. Add mandarin oranges and the juice. Bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. When completely cooled, cover with topping.
Topping/Frosting:
Combine Pineapple and juice with pudding mix. Fold in cool whip and spread on cooled cake.  This cake should be kept in refrigerator. I added the Marcino Cherries and coconut on top of the cake for effect, if you like them.

Description: 
This cake is simple and quick. My Mom used to make this as a reward for a good report card or a special treat. It is a light cake with tons of flavor and it will disappear quick.
