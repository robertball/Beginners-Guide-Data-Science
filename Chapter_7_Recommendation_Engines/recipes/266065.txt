Ingredients:
5 1/2 cups water, divided
2 cups quinoa
3 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules, divided
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TELÂ® Chunky)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in quinoa and 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine remaining 1 1/2 cups water and 1 teaspoon bouillon with black beans, diced tomatoes, cumin, coriander, garlic powder, and pepper in another medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cover. Simmer until quinoa is ready.
Remove quinoa from heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Spoon the quinoa into bowls. Top with the seasoned beans and Monterey Jack cheese.
