Ingredients:
5  lb whole roasting chicken, giblets removed
1 cup chicken stock
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp corn starch (optional)
dried rosemary & parsley, to taste

Directions:
Rub chicken all over with salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, and parsley.
Set an Instant Pot to saute and add 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil to the pot. When oil is hot, place chicken in the oil, breast side down, and brown the skin for 5 minutes. Use tongs to flip the chicken and repeat on other side. Then carefully remove chicken and set aside.
Add chicken stock to pot and deglaze the pan.
Place the rack insert into the pot and return chicken, breast side up. Put the lid onto Instant Pot and press the poultry button, or set manual time for 28 minutes.
After chicken has cooked, manually release pressure and carefully remove chicken to a carving board to rest.
If desired, turn to saute and whisk 2 tsp corn starch into pot with stock and drippings, to make a gravy.
