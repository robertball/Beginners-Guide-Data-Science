Ingredients:
1 large cushaw gourd, peeled, seeded, and chopped
3 cup heavy cream
4 eggs
1 1/2 cup clover honey
5 tsp. cinnamon
2 tsp. salt
3 tsp. ginger
14 tsp. allspice
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
4 Tbs. molasses
2 cups hard white flour
12 2/3 tbsp. butter
7 Tbs. ice cold water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees (350 degrees for convection).
Steam cushaw in steamer basket until very tender (should be able to mash with fork).
Blend the cushaw in blender until smooth. Pour 6 cups blended cushaw in large mixing bowl. If there is extra cushaw, it can be saved and frozen for up to 3 months.
Add cream, eggs, honey, cinnamon, 1 tsp. salt, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and molasses. Whisk together until smooth. Cover and set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine flour and 1 tsp. salt. Soften butter in microwave (about 15 sec.) and cut into flour.
Add water and mix. If dough is too wet add a little more flour.
Divide dough in half and roll out on floured surface.
Form dough into two 10" pie pans. Pour cushaw filling into pans.
Bake at in preheated oven for 40-50 minutes until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
Early in the summer, I found an unknown plant growing in my front garden. Think it might be a squash vine, I let it grow and discovered cushaws! Sweet like pumpkins but very green, they make perfect, delectable pies.
