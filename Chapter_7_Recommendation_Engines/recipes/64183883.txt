Description: 
A perfect side dish for a meaty entree, this slaw has the crunch of raw vegetables and a tangy dressing to complement roasted pork or lamb.  Be sure to shred your veggies evenly using a sharp knife, box grater or mandoline.  Although it's ready as soon as it's done, leaving it to sit overnight will allow the flavors of the dressing to saturate the veggies and make it even taster.
