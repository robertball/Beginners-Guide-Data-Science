Ingredients:
2 packages frozen cream spinach (thawed)
1 can artichoke hearts (chopped)
1 (16 oz.) container light sour cream
1 env. Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix
1 diced onion
1 tbsp. Granulated Garlic
¾ tsp. Basil
½ tsp. Oregano
¼ cup Parmesan cheese
1 large loaf sourdough or pumpernickel bread round
Tortilla chips for dipping (use multicolored ones for a more festive dish)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except bread and chips.  Stir to blend well.  Slice off top of bread loaf neatly and save top.  Carve out bread in center of loaf allowing 1 inch all the way around to form bowl.  Spoon dip into bread bowl and replace top.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated 400-degree oven for 20 minutes.  Serve with Tortilla chips around loaf on a large plate.
Alternative:  leave top of bread off and cover top of dip with shredded Mozzarella Cheese, Jack or Colby Jack Cheese, or Provolone Cheese.  Bake uncovered until cheese is bubbly and slightly brown, careful not to brown bread too fast.  If necessary, use a 375 oven instead.
Garnish with sprigs of curly leaf parsley or sprigs of dill weed.
