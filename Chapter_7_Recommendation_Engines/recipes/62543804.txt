Ingredients:
Â½ cup butter
1 tsp baking soda
1 cup sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 eggs
1 cup mashed banana (Approx 3)
1 cup sifted flour
1/2 cup nuts
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Mix together, pour into greased loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.  Test with tooth pick to make sure it is done.
** I suggest freezing bananas when they are very ripe and putting them in a freezer bag, so when you want to make this bread you will have the bananas.  Just defrost, drain any excess water and peel.  You can also use fresh bananas.
