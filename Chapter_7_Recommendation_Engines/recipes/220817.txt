Ingredients:
4 1/2 ounces thin lemon tea cookies (such as Trader Joe'sÂ® Meyer Lemon Cookies), crushed
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pound fresh blueberries
2/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
3 tablespoons lemon curd
1/2 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Thoroughly mix crushed lemon cookies and butter together in a bowl.
Press cookie mixture into the bottom of an 8-inch springform pan.
Place blueberries and sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer until sugar has dissolved and a thin sauce forms, 10 minutes.
Stir cornstarch into blueberry sauce; simmer until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 10 minutes.
Stir mascarpone, lemon curd, and whipped topping together in a bowl until well blended and smooth.
Spread mascarpone mixture over the crust in the springform pan. Cover with waxed paper and freeze until semi-firm, about 10 minutes.
Spread blueberry sauce over mascarpone layer; cover with waxed paper and refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour.
