Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream
1 (8 ounce) can whole cranberry sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 or 10 inch tube pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the almond extract. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the sour cream.
Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared tube pan. Swirl 1/2 of the cranberry sauce into the batter. Repeat, ending with the batter on top.
Bake 55 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
