Ingredients:
5 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup white rice
1/3 cup broken pieces (about 2 inches) vermicelli pasta
1/2 cup chopped sweet onion
1/2 cup chopped green or red bell pepper
2 1/3 cups Swanson® Chicken Broth
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon granulated garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble. Drain bacon drippings from pan; wipe out with paper towels.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in rice and vermicelli; cook until they turn a golden brown, about 4 minutes.
Stir in chopped onions and bell pepper. Saute until the vegetables begin to soften, 2 or 3 minutes. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, garlic, parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper.
Bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer on low heat until liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Top with cooked crumbled bacon.
