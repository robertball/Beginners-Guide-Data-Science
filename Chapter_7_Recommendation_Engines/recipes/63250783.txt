Ingredients:
1 tsp garlic salt
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1 lb pork tenderloin
1/4 cup Sweet Red Chili Sauce (I used Thai Kitchen)
1 tbsp honey
1/2 tsp Sriracha sauce (or more to taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°. Mix garlic salt and ginger in small bowl. Rub evenly over pork. Place pork on rack in foil-lined roasting pan.
Roast pork in preheated oven 40 to 45 minutes or until desired pork is cooked to your liking. (New pork guidelines allow pork to cook to 145°, if you prefer it cooked well, cook it until the internal temp reads is 160° with a meat thermometer)
Mix chili sauce, honey and sriracha in small bowl.
Brush over pork during the last 10 minutes of cooking.
Slice pork and serve with pan juices and mango salsa on the side.
