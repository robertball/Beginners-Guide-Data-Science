Ingredients:
6 cups cubed rutabaga
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups milk
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 pinch paprika for garnish

Directions:
Bring rutabaga to a boil into a large pot of salted water over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in melted butter until golden, about 5 minutes.
Whisk flour into garlic mixture until smooth.
Slowly whisk milk into flour mixture until thickened and creamy, about 5 minutes.
Stir Cheddar cheese into milk sauce until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 3 minutes. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.
Transfer rutabaga to the prepared baking dish. Pour cheese sauce over rutabaga.
Sprinkle bread crumbs and paprika over rutabaga.
Bake in preheated oven until sauce is thickened and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
