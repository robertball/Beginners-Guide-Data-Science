Ingredients:
6 T. unsalted butter, divided
6 ounces mixed mushrooms, finely chopped
2 small shallots, finely chopped
Kosher salt
6 T water
6 T. milk
Freshly ground black pepper
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
In a large skillet over medium-high, melt 2 tsp. of the butter. Add the mushrooms, shallots and a hefty pinch of salt. Cook until tender and lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan over medium, combine the remaining butter, the water, milk and a hefty pinch of each salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then add the flour all at once. Stirring with a wooden spoon, mix well and continue to cook until the mixture becomes a ball that separates from the pan, 1 to 2 minutes.
Scoop the dough ball into the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes to allow the mixture to cool slightly. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly between additions. Stir in the reserved mushroom mixture and the blue cheese. Scooping by the tablespoonful, place walnut-sized dollops on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1-1/2 inches of space between each. Alternatively, transfer the dough into a large zip-close plastic bag. Snip off one of the lower corners and pipe (squeeze) the mixture into place on the prepared baking sheets. Or for a meal, drop by tablespoons (like cookies).
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.
