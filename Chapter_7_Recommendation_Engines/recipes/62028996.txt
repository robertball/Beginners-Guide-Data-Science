Ingredients:
5 eggs
1 1/2 cup whole milk
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 tsp. Salt
3/4 cup sugar
1 tbs. Corn starch
1 cup shredded coconut
1 9" pie shell (I use the one in the refrigerator section)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix all ingredients (except pie shell) in a blender until well blended. Pour mixture into pie shell (I use a deep-dish glass pie pan, the mixture fills the pan nicely). Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool and serve. Refrigerate leftover pie.

This is one of the best custard pies you will ever have!! The recipe was handed down by my mother. It is a holiday favorite in our house, and it's really easy to make!
