Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 cup water
2 cups cooked rice
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
10 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in taco seasoning and water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Stir in rice. Cook and stir until liquid is evaporated. Spread about 2 tablespoons of refried beans, 1/4 cup beef mixture and 1 tablespoon cheese down the center of each tortilla; roll up. Place seam side down in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dishes.
Combine salsa and soup; pour down the center of enchiladas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake one casserole, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Cover and freeze remaining casserole for up to 3 months.

Description: 
'I created these enchiladas to satisfy several picky eaters in our house,' explains Stacy Cizek of Conrad, Iowa. 'They were an instant hit and are now requested at least once a week. I especially like that we can enjoy this meal twice by freezing half for a later (and busier) day.'
