Ingredients:
1 pound pork sausage links
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
5 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
3 tablespoons shortening, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
Place sausages in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain on paper towels.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, white sugar, and salt; set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs until light and fluffy. Add milk and shortening; mix well. Gradually stir in dry ingredients until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan. Arrange sausages on top of the batter.
Bake in preheated oven until pancakes are golden brown and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Cut into 10 pieces and serve hot with butter and syrup.
