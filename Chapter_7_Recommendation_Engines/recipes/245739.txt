Ingredients:
1/2 cup loosely-packed celery leaves, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup kosher salt

Directions:
Line a microwave-safe plate with a paper towel. Place celery leaves in a single layer and cover with a second paper towel. Microwave leaves, rearranging if needed, in 30-second intervals until dry and crispy. Uncover and cool, about 10 minutes.
Measure out 2 tablespoons of dried leaves and crumble with your fingers. Add to salt and mix well. Briefly pulse in a spice grinder if desired.

Description: 
Make your own celery salt using leftover celery leaves! Using the microwave to dry them preserves the fresh taste and color. Plus, you can choose your favorite salt and avoid commercial additives. Store in an airtight shaker. Allow to sit for a week or two before using for optimal flavor.
