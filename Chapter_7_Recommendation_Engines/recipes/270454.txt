Description: 
These Russian kotlety are very easy and versatile. I usually add whatever's on hand to give the burgers a little something extra: a little oregano, thyme, herbes de Provence, etc... or go with some paprika and a little ancho chile powder. These are just some suggestions and can be altered to taste or completely left out.
