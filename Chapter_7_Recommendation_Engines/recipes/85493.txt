Ingredients:
2 ounces fried pork rinds
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons granular sucrolose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Spread the pork rinds out in a large baking dish. In a small bowl, stir together the cinnamon and sweetener. Drizzle melted butter over the pork rinds while shaking the dish to evenly distribute the butter on all sides of the rinds. Sprinkle with the cinnamon and sweetener, stirring to coat.

Description: 
These sound awful but taste pretty good - especially if you are on a low carb diet. Adjust cinnamon and sugar substitute amounts to your taste.
