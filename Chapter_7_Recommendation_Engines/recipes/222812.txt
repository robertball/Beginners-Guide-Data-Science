Description: 
Every time I serve this, it's a huge hit. Lots of fruity goodness that everyone wants the recipe for, and of course I give it to them! You can customize the fruit for your own desired flavors. We've used pineapple, apple, peach, and pear.  You can also use orange juice instead of lemonade concentrate, but we really like the lemonade; it gives it some zing.
