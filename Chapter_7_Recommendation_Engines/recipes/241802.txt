Ingredients:
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 clove garlic, minced
½ teaspoon ground ginger
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
fresh ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Directions:
Mix vinegar, ketchup, peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small, microwave-safe bowl.
Heat vinegar mixture in microwave oven until the peanut butter is softened, 10 to 15 seconds; stir mixture until smooth.
Put tofu into a large bowl. Pour sauce over the tofu and stir to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes to a full day, stirring occasionally to assure tofu remains coated in sauce.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spread tofu onto a baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake in preheated oven until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Marinate tofu in a mix of rice vinegar, peanut butter, ketchup, garlic, and soy sauce, and discover that tofu really can be tasty! I've tried this recipe by first freezing and defrosting the tofu; it creates a nice texture.
