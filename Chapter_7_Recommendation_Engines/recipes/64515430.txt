Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening (ex. Crisco)
1 tbsp. vanilla
1/4 tsp. salt (optional if using salted butter, but it will help cut the sweetness)
3 1/2 cups icing sugar
1/2 cup flour
2 - 6 tbsp. milk or cream
food color (optional, but fun!)

Directions:
Beat butter and shortening for 3 minutes.
Add flavoring & salt and beat till mixed in.
Add sugar, flour and enough milk/cream for desired consistency.
Beat another 3 minutes, till smooth & creamy.
* For rosette cupcakes - use Wilton 2D tip (closed star). Start icing in center of cupcake, moving clockwise outward from center. Super easy! 1 batch of frosting does about 24 rosette cupcakes.
