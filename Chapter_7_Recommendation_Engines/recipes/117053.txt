Description: 
Cheesy Pesto Bread is from Karen Grant of Tulare, California. I was out of French bread one day and remembered I had a packaged, prebaked bread crust on hand, she recalls. I topped it with pesto and cheese for dinner. Now its expected whenever I make pasta and salad. Its great heated up for lunch the next day, too.
