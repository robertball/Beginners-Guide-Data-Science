Ingredients:
2 pork tenderloins
4 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoons butter
2 shallots, minced
1 cup Marsala wine or sherry
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Coat pork tenderloins generously with mustard.
Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange tenderloins in pan, and brown the meat. Turn to brown evenly.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn, and continue cooking for 20 minutes, or until desired doneness.
Meanwhile, melt butter over medium heat in a pan. Cook shallots in butter until soft. Stir in Marsala, mustard, and cream, and cook until volume of liquid is reduced by half.
Slice pork, and place on a serving dish. Spoon sauce over meat, and serve.
