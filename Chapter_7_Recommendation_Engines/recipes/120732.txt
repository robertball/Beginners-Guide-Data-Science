Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted, divided
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
With a sharp knife, cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Slice each half widthwise six times, but not all the way through; fan potatoes slightly. Place in a shallow baking dish.
Brush potatoes with 1 tablespoon butter. Sprinkle with paprika, parsley, salt and pepper. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 50 minutes or until tender. Drizzle with remaining butter.

Description: 
These well-seasoned baked potatoes are a fun alternative to plain baked potatoes. It's easy to help yourself to just the amount you want, too, since the potato halves are scored into sections. My mom serves them alongside any meat.
