Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour
3 tbsp sugar
1 3/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
3 eggs
3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled slighty
1/2 tsp butter per batch to grease pan
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup whole milk (approx)
Maple syrup

Directions:
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 3 tbsp butter and buttermilk in another bowl. Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined. (Small lumps are fine.)
Cover batter and let rest overnight in the refrigerator.
Heat a large greased griddle or a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add milk to batter until it reaches desired consistency; the more milk, the thinner and more delicate the pancakes.
Working in batches of three pancakes, spoon batter onto gridle or skillet. Cook until surface of pancake is covered with bubbles, 2-3 minutes.
Drizzle warmed maple syrup over pancakes.
