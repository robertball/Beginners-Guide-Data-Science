Ingredients:
1 Small Potato (1/4 Cup Mashed)
1 Tbs. Milk
1 Tsp. Vanilla
32 oz./2lb. Bag Confectioners Sugar
Peanut Butter (room temp!)
Waxed Paper

Directions:
1. Peel Potato
2. Cut Potato into cubes.
3. Boil Potato Cubes until tender (ten minutes or so). (Mash a test pice with a fork)
4. Drain the water from the Potato Cubes.
5. Mash the Potato Cubes until mostly smooth.
6. Measure out 1/4 cup of Mashed Potato. (loosely, don't pack it down)
7. Mix Milk and Vanilla into the 1/4 Cup of Mashed Potatoes, and keep mashing until smooth. (get rid of the rest of the potatoes, you don't' need more than 1/4 cup)
8. Chill the Mashed Potatoes until they are at least room temperature. Cold Mashed Potatoes from the fridge work best if you can wait that long.
9. Add Half of the bag of Confectioners Sugar (16oz/1lb) all at once, and mix well. (If your mixture is soupy, don't panic yet- it's ok, we're about to fix that)
10. Now, take the rest of the Confectioners Sugar, (the other half of the bag- another 16oz/1lb), and dump it into your Mashed Potatoes all at once. Mix well and you should have Dough.
11. Lay the Dough between sheets of waxed paper, and roll into a rectangle, making the thickness about 1/4 inch.
12. Spread a thin layer of Peanut Butter over the Dough. (If it's hard to spread, stir it before you spread it)
13. Gently roll the Dough up onto itself, using the long side.
14. Use the Waxed Paper to wrap the Rolled Dough, and refrigerate the Rolled Dough for about an hour.
15. Once the Rolled Dough is cold, cut into 1/2 inch slices, and then keep stored in an airtight container.
