Ingredients:
5 lbs Potatoes, mashed
2 leeks, thin julienne
2 cloves Garlic
2 quarts Chicken stock
4 tbsp Butter
Cream to taste (optional)

Directions:
When cutting the leeks, make sure to rinse them well. Cut them in fourths and then into thirds. Then thinly julienne them so you get little matchsticks.
Place the mashed potatoes and chicken stock in a deep pot and bring to a boil. Stir frequently
Melt butter in a skillet. Add garlic. Cook garlic until you get a nice aroma then add the leeks. Cook until tender.
Add leek mixture to potatoes. Cover and let simmer until it thickens. (If you want it thicker, add a rue.)
Once it has thickened add cream if needed.
Can sit as long as need and saved for a couple days. It gets better the longer it sits.

Description: 
One night I got a little carried away on chopping potatoes and ended up making a lot of mashed potatoes. I wasn't sure what to do with them until my husband suggested making potato and leek soup out of them.
