Ingredients:
For the Turkey (Enough for 4 portions):
2 pounds boneless turkey breast with skin on
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1 teaspoon oil
8 slices bacon
2 tablespoons salted butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups heavy cream
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
For 4 Hot Browns:
8 slices white bread, toasted
12 slices tomato
8 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or to taste
1 pinch paprika, or to taste
4 teaspoons chopped Italian parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season the skinless side of the turkey breast with 1/2 of the kosher salt and herbes de Provence. Season the skin side with the remaining kosher salt. Place turkey skin-side up into an oiled baking dish.

Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the turkey registers 148 degrees F (64 degrees C), 45 to 60 minutes.

Place bacon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Remove turkey from the oven and let cool.
Bake bacon in the hot oven until about halfway cooked, 10 to 15 minutes.

Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Stir in flour until combined. Cook, stirring occasionally, until roux smells like cooked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream all at once. Cook until Mornay sauce is thickened and starting to boil, about 5 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat.

Stack 2 bread slices on top of each other and trim off the crusts. Cut 1 slice into 2 triangles. Place bread in a small baking dish set on top of a sheet pan. Top bread with 3 slices of turkey. Place 3 tomato slices in between. Ladle 1/4 of the Mornay sauce all over and cover with 2 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese. Sprinkle with paprika; lay the partially cooked bacon across the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more servings.

Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

Bake under the broiler until bacon is crispy and the tops are well browned, about 5 minutes. Place on napkin-lined plates and sprinkle parsley over each dish.
