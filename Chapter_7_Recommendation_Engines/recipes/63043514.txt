4 cups water
1 tsp beef boullion
Lemon juice or rice wine vinegar (just a splash will do)
1/4 cup pine nuts

Directions:
Add first four ingredients to a large skillet and cook on medium for 10 minutes or until beef is browned and cooked all the way through. Add rice, water and beef boullion and cook for 20 minutes until rice is soft and fluffy.
Meanwhile, in a small, dry skillet, heat pine nuts on high heat, watching carefully so as not to burn, for 2-4 minutes.
