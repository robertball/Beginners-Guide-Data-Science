Description: 
I get raves when I bring tossed salads to dinner parties because I also make my own dressing.  This vinaigrette is quite easy, using staples from your pantry and doesn't use salt!  Bulk up on the lemon juice for extra zing.  You can also substitute tarragon vinegar for a different feel. Serve over a tossed salad, antipasto, or as a quick marinade for beef, chicken, or pork.
