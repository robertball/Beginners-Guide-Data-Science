Ingredients:
one-electric skillet
4 skinless fish-fillets; I use catfish-you can use flounder or tilapia
Cajun seasoning, to taste (Emerill's Essence Cajun seasoning or Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning)
Flour; for dredging fish, optional
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 small bottle capers

Directions:
Rinse fillets in cold water; pat dry with paper towels.
Sprinkle both sides of fish with Cajun seasoning.
If using the flour; dredge fillets lightly in flour.
Place oil and 2 tablespoons butter in electric skillet on medium high/to high until butter melts.
Keep heat at medium high/high.
Place fish in skillet skin side up.  Cook fish   about 3 minutes more or less, depending on size of fillets. (catfish are thicker, I cook them on high heat).  Using your spatula pick up the fish to peek at it to see if it is browned.  (if you use flour it will be deep brown and crispy)
Flip fish over, cook on second side for about 3 minutes. Turn fish only once!
Remove fish to serving platter.  Cover fish loosely with foil to keep warm.    Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and pour in the entire jar of capers, liquid and all, whisk.  Turn off heat; pour/drizzle the thin sauce over fish fillets.
Serve immediately with wild rice.

Description: 
Using an electric skillet cooks the fish perfectly & quickly because of the high heat.                  With the electric skillet you can cook outside because it does cause steam/vapor when dumping in the jar of capers while making the sauce.     If cooking on stovetop be sure to have the stove vent fan on.  We love this fish with capers dish served with wild rice and asparagus.
