Ingredients:
1 large cauliflower head
4-6 hard boiled eggs divided
1 medium celery stalk - finely diced
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup prepared mustard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 1/4 teaspoon salt divided
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper

Directions:
Cut the cauliflower into bite size pieces and set aside.
Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water and 1 teaspoon of salt and heat until boiling.  Reduce the heat to medium and add the cauliflower pieces and cover with a lid.  Allow the cauliflower to "steam" for 8-10 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork.
Once tender, drain the pot and allow the cauliflower to cool in the colander/strainer for 10 minutes.
Transfer the cooled cauliflower to a large mixing bowl.  Slice and dice 3 hard boiled eggs and add to the bowl. Add the celery, dill relish, mayonnaise, mustard and fresh dill.  Gently toss to coat evenly.
Add the vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and the pepper.  Stir to distribute. Add more salt and or pepper, according to taste. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
Before serving, sprinkle with paprika and garnish with a sliced hard boiled egg and a sprig of parsley.
