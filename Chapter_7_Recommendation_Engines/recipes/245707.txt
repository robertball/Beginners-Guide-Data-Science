Ingredients:
2 pounds salt
7 bay leaves
2 pounds whole rainbow trout, gutted and cleaned, heads and tails still on
2 sprigs fresh cilantro, or more to taste
2 sprigs fresh parsley, or more to taste
2 sprigs fresh dill, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Spread 1/4 to 1/2 pound of salt on the aluminum foil in the approximate shape of the fish. Lay bay leaves on top of the salt. Place fish on top. Stuff fish cavity with cilantro, parsley, and dill. Pack down remaining salt firmly over fish, leaving head and tail exposed.
Bake in the preheated oven until salt crust is golden, about 30 minutes.
Take fish out of oven. Carefully crack open the salt crust; remove top. Peel skin off the fish to expose flesh. Lift the top fillet off the bones using a fish knife or spatula. Remove bones in one piece by lifting from the tail and pulling upwards toward the head. Lift the bottom fillet out with the knife or spatula.
