Ingredients:
4-5 medium sized baking potatoes
olive oil
dried rosemary
coarse or fine salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to about 425F (bake).
Cut the potatoes (with skin or without) into about the size of the "O" made with your thumb and index finger. Place a sheet of parchment paper into a baking sheet/pan. Spread the potato pieces evenly onto the pan. Try not to overlap the potatoes to ensure that they will be evenly cooked.
Rub enough olive oil onto the potatoes so that they will be coated on all sides.
Sprinkle salt evenly onto the potatoes (as much as desired).
Sprinkle some dried rosemary onto the potatoes.
Bake in the oven on the middle rack for about 40 minutes, or until golden brown (crispy on the outside and soft on the inside).
