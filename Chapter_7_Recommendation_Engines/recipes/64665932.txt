Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped red onion
1 baby cucumber, sliced
4 small radishes, quartered
1/4 cup kalamata olives, halved
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted

Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the quinoa and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes or until quinoa is just tender and liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat, uncover, and let cool completely.
2. In a large bowl combine the cooled quinoa, cherry tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, radishes, olives, mint, parsley, lemon juice, olive oil, 1/4 tsp. salt, and black pepper. Mix well.
