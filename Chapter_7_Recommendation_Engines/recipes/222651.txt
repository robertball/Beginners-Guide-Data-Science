Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup cooked brown rice
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup bread crumbs
2 tablespoons salsa
1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/4 cup salsa
4 hamburger buns, split
4 lettuce leaves
4 slices reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Mash beans with a fork in a large bowl. Stir in rice, onion, egg, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons salsa; mix well.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat; drop bean mixture by 1/2-cupfuls into skillet and flatten to 1/2-inch thickness. Cook until each side is firm and browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Combine sour cream and 4 tablespoons salsa in a small bowl. Place a bean burger on bun with a lettuce leaf, 1 slice Cheddar cheese, and top with salsa mixture. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
