Ingredients:
1 pound dry penne pasta
1 onion, chopped
1 pound lean ground beef
2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced (I use 2 packages for 9x13 pan)
1 cup sour cream
1 cup ricotta cheese (I "plop" a spoon of sour cream, then a spoon of ricotta in a checkerboard type pattern and then smooth it out with spatula)
6 ounces (or more) mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.
In a large skillet, brown onion and ground beef over medium heat. Add spaghetti sauce, and simmer 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter or spray a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer as follows: 1/2 of the penne, a little spagetti sauce and stir it up together so pasta doesn't stick to pan. Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 sauce mixture, remaining pasta, mozzarella cheese and remaining sauce mixture. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheeses are melted.
