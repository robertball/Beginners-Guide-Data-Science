Ingredients:
Boxed Vanilla Cake Mix & Associated Ingredients
8 Ounces Fresh Raspberries
1 Tablespoon Water
3 Tablespoons Sugar
1 Tablespoon Cornstarch Mixed In 1/4 Cup Water
5 Cups Confectioner's Sugar
1 Cup Butter
2 Cups White Chocolate Chips, Melted
2-3 Tablespoons Milk

Directions:
FOR VANILLA CUPCAKE:  Preheat oven to 350 ºF. Grease muffin pans or line with paper baking cups.  Combine cake mix and associated ingredients in large bowl. Beat at low speed with electric mixer until moistened. Beat at medium speed 2 minutes. Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full.  Bake at 350ºF for 18 to 23 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Cool in pans 5 minutes. Remove to cooling racks. Cool completely.
FOR THE RASPBERRY PUREE:  Puree raspberries, water, sugar, and cornstarch/water mixture together. Cut a hole in the middle of each cupcake and fill with the puree.
FOR THE WHITE CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM:  Using mixer, cream butter until soft.  Add half of the confectioner's sugar, the milk, and melted white chocolate.  Mix until smooth and creamy.  Slowly add remaining sugar and mix until smooth.  Add additional milk or sugar until correct consistency.  Important note, if using a piping bag and decorative tip to ice the cupcakes, make sure that the white chocolate is completely melted and there are no small chunks.
DECORATE:  Drizzle any remaining raspberry puree over cupcake and/or top with a single raspberry.
