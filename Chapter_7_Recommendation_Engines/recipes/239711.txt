Ingredients:
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3/4 cup evaporated milk
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Stir flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth. Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture and stir until batter is well mixed. Fill muffin cups with batter, about 1/3 cup per cupcake.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the pan for 20 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
