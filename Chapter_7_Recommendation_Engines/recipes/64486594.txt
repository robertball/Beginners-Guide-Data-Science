Ingredients:
Marinade:
6 tablespoons honey
5 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Enchiladas:
2-3 cups chicken, cooked and shredded (I usually boil 4 chicken breasts and shred them)
8-10 flour tortillas
4 cups Monterrey jack cheese, shredded
2 cups green enchilada sauce, divided
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Whisk together marinade ingredients and toss with shredded chicken in a Ziploc bag or airtight container.
Let chicken mixture marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, but preferably a few hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Pour 1/2 cup enchilada sauce on the bottom of a 9X13-inch baking pan.
Fill the tortillas with chicken, saving marinade, and shredded cheese, reserving about 1 cup of cheese to sprinkle on top of enchiladas.
Placed rolled tortillas into prepared pan.
Mix the remaining enchilada sauce with heavy cream and leftover marinade, if any, and pour on top of enchiladas.
Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until brown and crispy on top.
