Ingredients:
2 eggplant,  thinly sliced
2 eggs, beaten
salt
1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 1/2 cups panko breading
1 (24 oz) jar marinara sauce
2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Sprinkle the each slice of eggplant with salt and layer in a colander.  Weigh down the slices with a couple of plates.  Allow to sit for at least an hour.  The salt draws out the bitter juices from the eggplant.  Remove slices from colander and rinse the salt from the eggplant.  Pat the slices dry with paper towels.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease baking sheet with 1/4 olive oil.
Dip eggplant slices in egg, then in bread crumbs.  Place in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes on each side.
In a 9x9 inch baking dish spread marinara sauce to cover the bottom.  Place a layer of eggplant slices in the sauce.  Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with the cheeses.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
This budget version is still a no fry recipe but you would never know it.  By coating the baking sheet with olive oil and replacing half of the Italian breadcrumbs with panko, the eggplant bakes up into crispy, crunchy little slices.  Layer the eggplant with store brand cheeses and a jar of your favorite marinara sauce.Modified from: Eggplant Parmesan II
