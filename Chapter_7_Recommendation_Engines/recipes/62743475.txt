Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)
1/2 cup finely chopped strawberries
4 cups powdered sugar
1-3 tablespoons skim milk
1 1/2 teaspoons strawberry extract

Directions:
In medium bowl, beat butter with electric mixer on low speed about 30 seconds, to soften, then on high speed until fluffy.  Add chopped strawberries and powdered sugar; beat on low speed until sugar is incorporated; increase speed to medium and beat until frosting is fluffy, stopping to add milk (until consistency is thin enough to spread, but still thick and creamy)  Add strawberry extract.
If used on cake, spread on top & between layers and frost sides with whipped cream.  Fan a sliced strawberry on top...pretty!
