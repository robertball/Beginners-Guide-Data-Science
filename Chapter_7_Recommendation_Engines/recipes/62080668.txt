Ingredients:
2 teaspoons dried parsley
2 teaspoons dill weed
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon yellow mustard
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
In a ziplock freezer bag combine parsley, dill weed, salt, pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, yellow mustard, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce.  Add chicken to the bag, remove as much air as possible, use your hands to rub everything in, and marinate for 8 hours minimum before cooking. The longer you marinade the better the flavors.  The mustard will tenderize the chicken and the dill weed adds something extra.

Description: 
This is a wonderful marinade for anytime of the year!  You can bake or grill the chicken, but either way it comes out tender and tasty.  The dill weed really gives it a bright flavor.
