Ingredients:
2 cups cornmeal
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 eggs
1 cup margarine, melted
4 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup corn oil

Directions:
In a large bowl mix together the corn meal, flour, salt, and baking powder.
In a separate bowl mix together the eggs, butter, and buttermilk. Add to the dry ingredients and stir until well blended.
Heat a dry 12 inch cast iron skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Add corn oil to skillet, swirl oil around to coat bottom and sides. Leave remaining oil in pan. Return to high heat for 1 minute.
Pour the cornbread batter into the skillet and cook on high heat until bubbles start to form in the center. Remove from stove.
Bake in a preheated 400 degree F (200 degree C) oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Serve warm.
