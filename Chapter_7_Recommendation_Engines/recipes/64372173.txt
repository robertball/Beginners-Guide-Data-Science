Ingredients:
2 pounds veal cutlets
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
1/2 cup Marsala wine
1/4 cup heavy cream (optional)

Directions:
Place meat on a solid, level surface, or between sheets of waxed paper, and pound thinly with a mallet or moistened cleaver, using a glancing motion.
In shallow dish, combine flour and seasoning salt.  Dredge cutlets in flour mixture, and let rest 15 minutes on wire rack.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter with oil.  Cook floured cutlets on both sides until brown. Remove from pan and set aside. Add mushrooms to the pan, reduce heat to low, cover and cook 10 minutes.
Pour in Marsala and heavy cream and simmer 5 minutes more, then add veal and simmer until heated through.  Serve immediately.
