Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
2 garlic scapes, sliced
1/2 cup cubed cooked ham
6 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion, garlic scapes, and ham in the melted butter until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.
Beat the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; pour into the skillet and cook, stirring continually, until the eggs have nearly set, but are still slightly moist. Add about half the Cheddar cheese; cook and stir until the eggs are completely cooked, about 5 minutes. Top with the remaining Cheddar cheese to serve.

Description: 
I recently was given some stalks of green garlic. I had no idea what to do with them, so I started looking for recipes and found this delicious egg recipe. There are endless variations but the key ingredients are the same.
