1/2 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup finely shredded carrots
1/2 cup finely diced fresh pineapple
1/2 cup raisins

1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Grease a 6-inch cake pan with butter and line with parchment paper. Butter interior of parchment paper lightly.
Combine eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl and beat using an electric mixer until well blended. Add flour, half-and-half, vegetable oil, baking powder, ground cinnamon, vanilla extract, ground nutmeg, and salt. Mix until batter is smooth. Fold in carrots, pineapple, and raisins; stir until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan and cover with aluminum foil.
Place the steaming rack inside a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Pour water into the pot. Lower the cake pan onto the rack. Close and lock the lid. Select Steam function and High pressure. Set timer for 50 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Turn vent to venting and release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Remove from the pan and cool on a cooling rack.
