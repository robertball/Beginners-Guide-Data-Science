Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups finely crushed chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs
2/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 3/4 cups Ghirardelli® Dark Chocolate 60% Cacao Baking Chips
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon Ghirardelli® Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mini Baking Chips
3 chocolate sandwich cookies or wafers, crushed

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, and salt. Press into the bottom and up the sides of an 11x8-inch rectangular or 9-inch square tart pan with a removable bottom. Cover and chill while preparing the filling.
For filling: Place dark chocolate chips in a large, heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, heat cream and 2 tablespoons butter just until simmering and butter melts. Pour over chips. Stir once. Let stand 5 minutes without stirring. Stir until smooth. Pour into crust.
Sprinkle evenly with mini chips and crushed cookies. Cover and chill at least 2 hours or overnight until set.
Let stand at room temperature 45 to 60 minutes before serving. Cut into small squares to serve.
