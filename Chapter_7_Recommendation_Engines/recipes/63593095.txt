Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/8 tsp. rapid rise dry yeast
1/2 tsp. sugar
1/4 tsp. salt
1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
1. Put flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in bowl of food processor and pulse once or twice to mix. Combine oil and 1/2 cup warm water in a small glass or measuring cup.
2. With food processor running, slowly pour water mixture through feed tube; process until a ball of dough forms. Let it run until dough is smooth, about another minute. Dough should be slightly tacky but not too sticky. If necessary, add a little flour, one tablespoon at a time and combine.
3. Oil a medium-size mixing bowl. Form dough into a ball and transfer to bowl, turning dough to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and place in a warm, draft-free spot until dough doubles in size, about 45 minutes.
