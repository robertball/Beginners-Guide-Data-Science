Ingredients:
6 eggs
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 teaspoon anise oil, or more to taste
5 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, butter, and anise oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat until creamy and well combined. Mix in 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt until combined. Slowly add remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing on low speed until mixture resembles a thick pancake batter.
Preheat a pizzelle cooking iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Drop a teaspoon of dough onto each plate of the cooking iron and close the lid. Cook just until steaming slows, 10 to 20 seconds. Repeat with remaining batches of batter.

Description: 
I could always count on finding these authentic Italian cookies in Grandma's freezer, and her house always smelled yummy! They're great dipped in milk. Grandpa was a blacksmith and actually made their waffle iron, which I still have, although I use my modern electric pizzelle maker when making these.
