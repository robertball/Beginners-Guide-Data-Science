Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
6 very ripe bananas, mashed
1 (16 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons baking soda
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white whole wheat flour
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease four 7x3-inch loaf pans.
Stir together 2 tablespoons white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Dust pans lightly with sugar mixture.
Beat butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Blend in eggs, mashed bananas, sour cream, vanilla extract, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Whisk together salt, baking soda, all-purpose flour, and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined; fold in nuts. Divide into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Esther is right! The sour cream makes this one so moist it melts in your mouth. I make it healthier by using light sour cream, whole wheat flour and less sugar and butter --and you know what? No one can tell the difference!
