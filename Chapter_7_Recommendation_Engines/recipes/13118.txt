Ingredients:
1/3 cup wild rice
1 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
5 cups milk

Directions:
Thoroughly rinse wild rice. In a saucepan bring to a boil wild rice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and water. Reduce heat and simmer 30 to 45 minutes or until tender.
Melt butter, add onions and celery. Cover and cook gently for 5 minutes until vegetables are tender (avoid browning vegetables). Stir in 2 teaspoons salt, pepper, and flour. Remove from heat and add milk, stirring until flour is well blended.
Return to low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until soup thickens. Add the cooked wild rice and simmer a few minutes to blend flavor. Serve hot, garnished with chopped chives.

The name says it all! For an even richer flavor, you can reduce the amount of whole milk and replace part of it with heavy cream. Garnish with chopped fresh chives.
