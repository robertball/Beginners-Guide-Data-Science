Ingredients:
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup mini marshmallows
1 cup non-dairy whipped topping

Directions:
Place peanut butter and marshmallows in a microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave for 20 seconds on high to "puff" the marshmallows.  Combine well (mixture will become stiff).
Gradually add whipped topping, stirring well until the mixture is smooth.
Serve immediately with sliced apples. Sweet-tart crisp apples like Fuji, Braeburn or Pink Lady are excellent with this dip.
You may store dip in the refrigerator;  allow to come to room temperature before serving, as the dip will become firm in the refrigerator.
