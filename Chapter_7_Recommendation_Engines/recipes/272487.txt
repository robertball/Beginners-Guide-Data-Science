Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups minced onion
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 (14 ounce) cans black beans, drained
1 1/2 pounds shredded cooked chicken
2 cups salsa
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon salt
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour in oil and add the onion and garlic. Saute until they just start to become translucent, about 5 minutes. Add in the oregano, cumin, and chili powder and cook for 1 minute longer. Mix in the black beans, chicken, and salsa. Bring to a boil and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Cheddar, green onions, cilantro, and salt.
Using a warm oven or a hot burner, warm the tortillas until they become soft and pliable. Lay out the softened tortillas on a work surface and divide the filling between the tortillas. Fold the sides of each tortilla in toward the middle; roll up like a burrito.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Heat remaining oil in a saute pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, work in batches and brown each chimichanga on all sides. Transfer chimichangas to a baking pan; place in the oven and bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
While traditional chimichangas are deep-fried, this version pan-fries them instead for a friendlier take on the classic. Feel free to add sour cream and guacamole, and don't forget a glass of 14 Hands Hot to Trot!
