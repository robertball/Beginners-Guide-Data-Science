Cut up un-cooked chicken into small chunks. Cook in a lightly oiled frying pan.
Boil 3 cups of water and add 3 cups of minute rice. Let sit for 5 minutes. Dice green onions.
In wok add rice, cooked chicken, cooked bacon, green onions and 1/2 cup soy sauce (or to taste). Mix together (bacon grease that was left in the bottom of the wok will mix with rice for extra flavour) Cook for about 2-3 minutes and serve!
