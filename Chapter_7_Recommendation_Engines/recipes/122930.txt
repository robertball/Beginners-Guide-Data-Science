Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 cup shortening
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup milk
3 cups chicken broth
1 cup cubed cooked chicken

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour,s alt and poultry seasoning; cut in shortening until crumbly. Combine egg and milk; stir into flour mixture just until combined. On a heavily floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut into 1-in. strips; cut strips into 2-in. lengths. In a large saucepan, bring broth to a boil. Add chicken. Reduce heat; drop dumplings onto simmering broth. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in a dumpling comes out clean (do not lift the cover while simmering).

I've shared this recipe with many people, and all agree-it never fails. The light, tender dumplings are cut into strips like wide noodles.
