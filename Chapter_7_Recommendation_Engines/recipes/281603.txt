Description: 
This is super and makes a juicy and delicious chicken. The basting mixture is a win and adds an excellent flavor to the crispy skin. You can modify this for a whole bird, you will need to add more cooking time and you are going to want to truss your chicken to make sure the legs and wings are tucked in. (Google it, it's way easier than you think.)
