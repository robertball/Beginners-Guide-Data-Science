Description: 
The use of whole beans creates an almost-white coffee ice cream, with all the robust flavor of freshly brewed coffee.  The oil from the beans seeps into the cream and the result is almost like a 'coffee cream tea' that turns into smooth, rich ice cream.

 Serve this ice cream in cold-brewed coffee for a delicious coffee-coffee float on hot days.
