Description: 
Created this in a dorm room when all the mug cake recipes I found were terrible. It's super easy to make and to memorize, and if you only use one mug, a tablespoon measure, and a spoon, you have a lot fewer dishes to do. Easy to make in under 5 minutes with minimal mess, so enjoy! And never feel bad about eating the entire thing yourself.
