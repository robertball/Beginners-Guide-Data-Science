Ingredients:
6 oz. dried fettuccine or linguine
2 cups fresh pea pods, tips trimmed, or one 6 oz. frozen pea pods
1 cup cooked turkey or chicken strips
1 cup coarsely chopped fresh pineapple or one 8 oz. can chunks, drained
1/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
2 Tbsp. creamy peanut butter
1 Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 Tbsp. lime juice or lemon juice
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.  Meanwhile, halve the fresh pea pods diagonally.  Place the pea pods and chicken in a large colander.  Pour hot cooking liquid from pasta over pea pods and chicken in colander; drain well.  Return pasta, pea pods, and chicken to the hot pan.  Add pineapple.
Meanwhile, for sauce, in a small saucepan stir chicken broth into peanut butter.  Heat and stir with a whisk until peanut butter melts.  Stir in soy sauce, lime juice, red pepper, and garlic; heat through.
Add sauce to the pasta mixture.  Gently stir to coat pasta with sauce.
