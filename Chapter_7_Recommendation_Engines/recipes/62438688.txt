Description: 
This is my version of Pad Thai. I love bean thread vermicelli but find its too slippery to toss the shrimp in it very well. In this recipe the shrimp and veggies are cooked separate and served atop the noodles. I made this for family and went over really well. It is very tasty, healthy and low-fat to boot!
