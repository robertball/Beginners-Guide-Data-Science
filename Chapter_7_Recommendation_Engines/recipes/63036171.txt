Ingredients:
1lbs Almond Bark(white chocolate)
18oz. jar of peanut butter(I always use JIF)

Directions:
I always break up the Almond Bark first it melts quicker. Place the broken Almond Bark in a glass microwavable mixing bowl(don't use plastic it melts).
Microwave the almond bark until it is no longer chunky. I always check it and stir it a couple times durning the microwave time.
When the almond bark is nice and creamy add the jar of peanut butter.
Stir the two together until well mixed and pour into a casserole dish.
The size of the casserole dish is up to you, if you want thick pieces of fudge use a smaller casserole dish, if you want thin pieces of fudge use a bigger dish. A little hint in clean up of the casserole dish is to line the dish with I always use press and seal.
Place the dish in the fridge and let the fudge harden, usually and hour or two.
Then when it hardens I always just lift the fudge out of the casserole dish using the press and seal that I lined it with and place it on the counter, using a pizza cutter I cut the fudge into the size squares you prefer. This is the easiest peanut butter fudge ever. And it is so good. I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as I do
