Ingredients:
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (8 ounce) tube refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and cut into quarters
1/2 cup diced apple (optional)

Directions:
Mix brown sugar, water, butter, and cinnamon together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until the butter melts, about 2 minutes.
Stir biscuit dough and apple with the sugar mixture to coat dough pieces completely. Spread the mixture evenly around the ring of a microwave-safe tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Cook in microwave oven on High for 3 minutes. Let rolls finish cooking as they rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Invert onto a serving platter.
