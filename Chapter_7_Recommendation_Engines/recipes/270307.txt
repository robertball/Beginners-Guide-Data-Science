Ingredients:
8 bone-in chicken thighs
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons paprika
3 tablespoons ground cumin
3 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
3 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 lemon, zested and juiced
olive oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil, or to taste
1/2 white onion, chopped
1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine chicken broth, paprika, cumin, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, and 2 teaspoons lemon zest in a bowl.
Heat oils in a cast iron skillet until they begin to smoke. Add chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 4 minutes. Flip thighs and continue cooking until skin is crispy, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Saute onion in the skillet until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth mixture carefully over onion; scrape up any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet.
Return chicken thighs to the skillet. Spoon some of the liquid over the thighs.
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven; bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes.
Add olives to the skillet. Drizzle lemon juice over the thighs and garnish the whole dish with parsley.
