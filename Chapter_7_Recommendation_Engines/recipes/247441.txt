Ingredients:
1 pound small new potatoes, cut into quarters
2 pounds uncooked shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 pound kielbasa sausage, sliced
2 ears corn, cut in half
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's速)
1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
1 lemon, cut into 4 wedges
Crusty bread
Hot sauce
Reynolds Wrap速 Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Heat a grill to about 375 degrees F.
Add potato pieces to a large pot of water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, just to jump-start the cooking process. Drain.
Arrange 4 (12x18-inch) sheets of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil on a clean work surface.
Divide the shrimp, slightly cooked potatoes, kielbasa and corn atop the 4 pieces of foil, piling in the center. Add 1 tablespoon butter to each pile. Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon olive oil, sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle generously with Creole seasoning. Squeeze a lemon wedge over each pile and add the rind to the mixture. Sprinkle with black pepper.
Wrap each piece of foil into a tightly sealed pouch. Place on the grill. Cover. Allow to cook and steam for 15 to 18 minutes until the shrimp and potatoes are cooked through.
Serve by carefully unwrapping the foil and serving with slices of bread and hot sauce.
