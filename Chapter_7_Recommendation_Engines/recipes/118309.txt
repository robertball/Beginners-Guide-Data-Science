Description: 
There's no added sugar in this jam, so even if you're watching your diet, you can enjoy it on your morning toast,' notes Mary Fenske of Bricelyn, Minnesota. 'There's no need to wait for harvest season to make it either, since the recipe calls for dried apricots. I often give this chunky spread as a gift to my four grown children and 10 grandkids.'
