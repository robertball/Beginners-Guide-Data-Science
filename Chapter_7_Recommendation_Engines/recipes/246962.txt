Ingredients:
1/2 cup chestnut flour
3 tablespoons white rice flour
1 tablespoon potato starch
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup milk
1 egg, separated
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon honey

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Mix chestnut flour, white rice flour, potato starch, and baking powder together in a large bowl.
Combine milk, egg yolk, vegetable oil, and honey in another bowl. Sift in flour mixture, whisking constantly to prevent lumps in the batter.
Beat egg white in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until peaks form. Fold gently into batter until just combined.
Pour batter onto preheated waffle iron and cook until golden brown per manufacturer's instructions, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
The rich and nutty flavor of chestnut flour makes a deliciously unique waffle. Light in texture but hearty in flavor, this is a perfect treat for those cool autumn mornings. Chestnut flour has a smoky flavor that hints of molasses. When you taste these hot waffles topped with maple syrup you'll think Mother Nature arranged this marriage!
