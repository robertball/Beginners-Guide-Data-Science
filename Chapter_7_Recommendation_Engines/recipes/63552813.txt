Ingredients:
1lb 93% Lean Ground Beef
1 can Manwich, Bold or Original
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced green and/or red peppers
2-3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp olive or canola oil

Directions:
1. Saute onion, peppers, and garlic in olive or canola oil.
2. Remove vegetables from pan and set aside.  Using the same pan, brown ground beef on medium-high heat.  Using 93% Lean means you won't have to drain the grease from the meat.
3. Add vegetables to the beef and let simmer on medium heat for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add manwich, stirring in until well mixed.  Let simmer on medium heat 1-2 minutes and serve on bread of choice.
