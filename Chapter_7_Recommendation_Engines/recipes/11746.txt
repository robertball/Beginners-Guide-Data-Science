Ingredients:
2 pounds elbow macaroni
10 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
10 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
10 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup milk
salt to taste
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1 pinch garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
3 tablespoons margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a large bowl, combine macaroni, Swiss, mozzarella and Cheddar and stir until cheeses melt.  Stir in milk.  Season to taste with salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and parsley.  Spoon into prepared dish, and dot with margarine.
Bake in preheated oven 50 to 60 minutes, or until top is crunchy.

Description: 
I use three kinds of cheese to make this rich, baked macaroni and cheese.  My husband considers it a special treat, and my six-year old son especially likes the 'stringy cheese'!  The shape of the baking pan will affect the outcome.  I like lots of 'crunchy stuff,' so prefer a long, shallow pan. A deeper, narrower pan will yield more of the soft 'insides.'
