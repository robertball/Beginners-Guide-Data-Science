Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
½  Spanish onion, sliced into rings
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ cup light garlic cream cheese
¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons light garlic cream cheese, divided
4 slices focaccia bread
2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons blue cheese salad dressing
½  jalapeno pepper, cut into rings

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. Remove from heat and shred using 2 forks.
Mix 1/4 cup cream cheese, hot sauce, vinegar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into the shredded chicken.
Spread 1 tablespoon cream cheese over 2 focaccia slices; lay Cheddar cheese on top. Add heaping spoonfuls of shredded chicken mixture. Drizzle blue cheese dressing on top. Cover with onion and jalapeno rings. Top with remaining focaccia slices.
Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook sandwiches until Cheddar cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.
