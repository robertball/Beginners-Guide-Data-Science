Ingredients:
8 meaty pork loin spare ribs
1 can beef broth
1/2 cup catsup
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning
1/4 cup dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
salt to taste
pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Cover the ribs with seasoned water. Bring to a boil and boil for 45 minutes. Drain the water off. Set the ribs aside on a separate dish.
2. Add lite olive oil to the pot and brown the spare ribs in the oil. When browned on both sides, again, set the ribs aside on a separate dish.
3. Mix all the wet and dry ingredients together making the sauce in the same pot, using this sauce to de-glaze the pot.
4. Once all the ingredients have blended, and the de-glazing is done, add the browned ribs to the sauce and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer in covered pot until ribs are tender and fall off the bone, about 3 hours.

Description: 
I reviewed all the recipes for spare ribs and then borrowed ideas from many of them to come up with a blend that we tasted and loved. Great accompaniment to Sunday afternoon football games on tv.
