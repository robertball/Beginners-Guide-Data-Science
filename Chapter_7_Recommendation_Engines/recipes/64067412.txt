1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds well-trimmed boneless beef short ribs, cut into 1-1/2-in. pieces
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 large onion, chopped
1 medium carrot, chopped
1 celery rib, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
5 cups beef stock
1 cup dry red wine or additional beef stock

1 package (14 ounces) frozen pearl onions, thawed
4 medium carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a shallow bowl, mix 1/2 cup flour, 3/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Dip short ribs in flour mixture to coat all sides; shake off excess.
In an ovenproof Dutch oven, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Brown beef in batches. Remove from pan.
In same pan, heat remaining oil over medium heat. Add onion, chopped carrot and celery; cook and stir 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in tomato paste and remaining flour until blended. Gradually stir in stock and wine until smooth. Return beef to pan; stir in poultry seasoning, bay leaf and remaining salt. Bring to a boil.
Bake, covered, 1-3/4 hours. Stir in pearl onions and carrot pieces. Bake, covered, 30-45 minutes longer or until beef and onions are tender. Skim fat and remove bay leaf.
In a small bowl, mix biscuit mix and milk just until a soft dough forms. Drop by scant 1/4 cupfuls over beef mixture. Bake, uncovered, 40-45 minutes longer or until topping is golden brown. Sprinkle with thyme. Yield: 8 servings.
