Ingredients:
2 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch julienned slices
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Place potatoes in a bowl drizzle with butter and toss to coat. Transfer to a lightly greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes until golden brown, turning once. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Description: 
These fries are 'skinny' since they bake to a crisp in the oven, without submerging the potatoes in oil or fat. They're great with a meal or as a snack. -Ann Janis, Tucson, Arizona
