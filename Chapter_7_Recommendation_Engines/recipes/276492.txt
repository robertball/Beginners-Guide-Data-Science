Ingredients:
olive oil cooking spray (such as PAMÂ®)
1 (16 ounce) tube prepared plain polenta, cut into slices
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4 cups packed baby spinach
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained, juice reserved

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place polenta slices on a baking sheet and mist with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Cook garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until tender, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in paprika and cook for about 30 seconds. Stir spinach, beans, and 1/4 cup reserved bean liquid into the pan. Cook and stir until beans are heated through and spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Serve vegetables over polenta.

Description: 
I love this veggie-packed dish. I've served the veggie topping over polenta, couscous, and with gnocchi to rave reviews with each variation. Even my unadventurous mom liked it! Leftovers are delicious, too! Plus, it's quick and easy! Sprinkle with additional paprika, if desired.
