1/2 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

1/3 cup vegetable oil

In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, orange peel and salt; mix well. In a small bowl, combine orange juice, oil and egg; blend well. Add dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened (batter will be lumpy.)
Fill cups 2/3 full.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 1 minute before removing from pan. Serve warm.
