Ingredients:
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 cups uncooked orzo pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cloves garlic, sliced
1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves coarsely chopped
1 large lemon, juiced
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Pinch of cumin
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; sprinkle the turmeric over the boiling water and stir in the orzo; return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Scrape into a mixing bowl and set aside.
Heat some chicken broth in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir the picked kale into the garlic, cover the skillet with a lid, and steam for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and continue cooking and stirring until the kale is tender, added a little olive oil...about 10 minutes more. Stir the kale mixture into the orzo along with the lemon juice, nutmeg, cumin and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
