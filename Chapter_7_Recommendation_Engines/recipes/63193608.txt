Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, small dice
1/4 red bell pepper, small dice
1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
2 cups chicken broth (or water with 2 chicken bullion cubes)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2.
Prepare a 1 quart baking dish with cooking spray.
3.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat (7 on a scale of 10), add the onion, celery and red bell pepper. Sauté until the onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
4.
Add the rice and cook, stirring regularly to keep the rice from sticking and burning, until the rice turns golden brown. It’s ok if some of the rice browns and some doesn’t.
5.
Pour in the chicken broth and simmer another 5 minutes then transfer to the prepared dish.
6.
Bake until the broth is completely absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes.
7.
Fluff with a fork and serve.
