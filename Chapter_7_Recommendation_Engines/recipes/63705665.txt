Ingredients:
1/2 cup peanut butter - no-stir creamy natural (See note below for brand)
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg, beaten
2 teaspoons of vanilla
1/2 cup of semi-sweet - chocolate chunks (see notes below for brand)
1/4 cup of chopped pecans

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl mix peanut butter with sugar until creamy.
In a small bowl beat the egg, then add to the peanut butter mixture and blend well.
Stir in the vanilla.
Lastly, fold in the chocolate chunks and chopped pecans.
Scoop the cookies evenly onto the parchment lined sheet using a cookie scoop. Gently press the the tops slightly.
Bake 10-11 minutes. Do not over bake. Will still look slightly soft.
Let rest on the baking sheet until cool and then store in an air tight container.
