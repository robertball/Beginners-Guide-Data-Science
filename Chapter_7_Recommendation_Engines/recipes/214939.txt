Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable stock
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
1/2 cup packed fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 cup pitted green olives
4 heirloom tomatoes, quartered
15 cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 English cucumber, cubed
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Bring the vegetable stock to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the couscous and cook and stir until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir the toasted couscous into the hot vegetable stock and return to a simmer. Cover and cook until the stock has been absorbed into the couscous, about 15 minutes. Scrape into a mixing bowl, fluff with a fork, and allow to cool to room temperature.
Place the basil, parsley, garlic, oregano, thyme, and olives into a food processor; pulse until the herbs are coarsely chopped. Stir the herb mixture into the couscous along with the heirloom tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and feta cheese. Drizzle with the vinegar, 1/2 cup olive oil, and lemon juice. Stir until evenly combined.
