Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup apricot preserves or jam
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix together ground beef, chestnuts, soy sauce, brown sugar, onion powder, and garlic powder thoroughly in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 2 tablespoon-sized balls, and place onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Stir together the apricot preserves and the cider vinegar, toss with meatballs in a clean bowl, then return to baking sheet, and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
