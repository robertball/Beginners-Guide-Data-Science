Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons red food coloring
1 cup dark chocolate chips, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat butter with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 2 minutes; beat in brown sugar and white sugar until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat egg, milk, and vanilla extract into butter mixture; beat in food coloring until uniformly colored.
Stir flour mixture into butter mixture gradually with electric mixer on low speed until combined; stir in 1 cup chocolate chips. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; place in the refrigerator for 1 hour or up to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Roll dough into 2-inch balls; place on prepared baking sheets and flatten slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle cookies with a few additional chocolate chips; allow to cool completely.
