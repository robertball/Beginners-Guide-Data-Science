Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground turkey
1/2 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 Tbsp dried Oregano
1 Tbsp dried Basil
1 Tbsp dried Parsley or 1/4 cup fresh chopped
1/2 tsp Crushed Red Pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 can Pillsbury Original bread sticks
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
12 (10"-12") wooden skewers
Marinara sauce for dipping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.
In bowl combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, Oregano, Basil, Parsley, red pepper flakes and garlic. Form into 1 inch meatballs.
Open can of bread sticks and starting with one bread stick at a time thread dough then meatball. Repeat the process with 2 more meatballs alternating dough-meatball, ending with dough. Make sure to spread dough and meatballs away from each other by about 1/4", so the meatballs bake through and the dough has room to expand.
Bake for 20 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through. Remove from oven and sprinkle each skewer with 1-2 Tbsp of shredded mozzarella cheese. Place back in oven for 2-3 minutes until cheese is melted.
Serve immediately with warm marinara sauce for dipping.
