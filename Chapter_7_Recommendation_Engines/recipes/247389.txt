Description: 
So... you are making hummus or some other dish with chickpeas and you are just wasting the chickpea water? How dare you! Didn't you know it can form the basis of some the most delicious, light, and foamy vegan ice creams and mousses?

 I didn't know either but since Lina told me about it I am never going to waste a drop of chickpea water again.
