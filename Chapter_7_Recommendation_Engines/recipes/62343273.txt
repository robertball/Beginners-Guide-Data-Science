Ingredients:
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (12 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and cut into four pieces
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter 6 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Combine the pumpkin pie spice and white sugar in a small bowl; roll the biscuit pieces in the mixture to coat. Divide the coated pieces between the prepared muffin cups.
Combine the brown sugar, butter, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring continuously. Allow the mixture to boil until the sugar is completely dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon the mixture slowly over the biscuit pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, according to the directions on the biscuit package.
