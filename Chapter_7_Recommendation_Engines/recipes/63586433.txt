Buttery Rosemary Rolls Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk (or 1% or rice?)
1/4 evaporated cane juice (trying with 2 tbsp)
1/2 coconut oil
1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast (.25 oz)
4 1/2 cups whole grain wheat flour (1/2 cup divided out)
1/2 tsp baking powder (heaping)
1/2 tsp baking soda (scant)
1 1/2 tsp salt
TOPPING:
1 cup melted salted butter (olive oil)
1 sprig rosemary, or desired (stripped and chopped)
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
course salt

Directions:
Heat the milk, coconut oil, and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat to just below a boil. Set aside and cool to warm (in the freezer speeds this process). Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk for 1 minute.
Add 4 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, then cover with a clean kitchen towel, and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine. (I did this with a dough hook in my mixer for 2 - 3 minutes on low)
Use the dough right away, or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. (Note: dough is easier to work with if itâ€™s been chilled for at least an hour or so beforehand.)
Oil an iron skillet with olive oil. Shape dough into 1.5 oz. or 2.0 oz. balls (If you want your rolls to be pull-a-part style do 2.0 oz. balls) and place them in the skillet, leaving plenty of room for rising. (8-9 balls in a small skillet or 11-12 balls in a large skillet.) Cover and allow to rise for 20-40 minutes. (Remaining dough can be frozen immediately after they have been shaped into balls and pulled out for a later use. Just allow them 2-3 hours to proof)
Preheat oven to 375
After rising, brush rolls with melted butter.
Sprinkle on chopped rosemary. Brush with additional butter. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 375, until rolls are a deep golden brown on top.
Serve skillet on the table.
