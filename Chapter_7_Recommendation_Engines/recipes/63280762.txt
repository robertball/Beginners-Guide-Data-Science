Ingredients:
3 cups fresh peaches
2 cups sugar
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
2 tsp lemon juice (to prevent discoloring while peeling & pitting peaches)
1/2 c brown sugar
2 tsp cinnamon divided
1 1/2 to 2 c self rising flour
4 tbl of butter
Raw sugar for topping

Directions:
Use the lemon juice in your bowl of peaches and stir while you clean all of the peaches.  Or just use frozen.
In a cast iron skillet, (10") bring peaches, 1 1/2 cups of sugar (adjust to your liking), pecans, 1 tsp cinnamon (or less) to a soft boil.  In the meantime, put self rising flour in a bowl and add the remaining cinnamon, sugar and brown sugar and melted butter and stir well to get an oatmeal type consistency.  place on top of hot peaches and dot with more butter.  Sprinkle with Raw Sugar.  I baked mine a few minutes on 400F then carefully turned the dough in peach juices 2 or 3 times to wet the flour then continued to bake for until it totalled 30 minutes
