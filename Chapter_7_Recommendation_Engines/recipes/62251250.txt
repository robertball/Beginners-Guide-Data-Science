Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bacon, strips cut in half
1 (16 ounce) package fresh cut green beans
2 tablespoons brown sugar
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Clean and cut the green beans, blanch  for 10 minutes. Drain and place green beans in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.
Set out the bacon, green beans and casserole dish in a little assembly line. Lay out a half strip of bacon. place a small bunch of green beans (6 or 7) onto the strip of bacon and roll up into a bundle. Place the bundle into the casserole dish, seam side down. Repeat with remaining bacon strips and green beans. You can pack these pretty tight in the pan, just know that if the bacon is touching another bundle they take some prying to get apart. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and heated through, about 20 minutes. If the bacon still needs a little more cooking a quick broil will do.
