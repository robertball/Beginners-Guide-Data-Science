Ingredients:
32 oz. (one box) Chicken Broth or 32 oz. (one box) Vegetable Stock
Two Yellow Bell Peppers, rinsed and chopped
Three Shallots, diced
15.5 oz. White Beans such as Cannellini
1 Cup Heavy Cream
One Zucchini, sliced and diced
One Bunch Arugula, half snipped
4 Tbsp Olive Oil
½ tsp Dried Basil
½ tsp Dried Rosemary
½ tsp Dried Oregano
Grated Parmesan Cheese for garnish
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse, de-seed, and chop the yellow peppers into pieces, then sauté them in a large pot in 2 Tbsp olive oil for five minutes. Strain the cannellini beans if they are canned, and mince the shallots; add both during the last two minutes.
Add half of the arugula to the pot and continue cooking until it wilts.
Add chicken broth and bring it to a bubble, and once the peppers are soft, turn the heat off and pour the mixture into a food processor and purée until most of it is a smooth yellow.
Mix in cream, then return the soup to the pot and simmer it until it is ready to be served.
In the meantime, rinse, slice, and dice the zucchini and sauté with basil, oregano, and rosemary in the remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil for 6-10 minutes (until the pieces are soft), adding salt and pepper to taste.
Add the sauté and raw arugula (snipped into pieces) to the pot and heat through. Serve warm with Parmesan cheese as garnish.

Description: 
Like most of my dishes, this one came about as a result of me wanting to cook something new. I wanted to cook a creamy Italian soup in this case. It's a flavorful and creamy vegetable soup with plenty of garnish.
