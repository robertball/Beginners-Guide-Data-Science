Ingredients:
1 T garlic, minced
1 T fresh thyme, minced or 1 T Greek oregano, crushed
1 T extra virgin olive oil
1/2 T cracked black pepper
zest and juice from one half lemon
pinch of salt
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
Tzatziki sauce (recipe follows)
2 large pita bread rounds
1/2 heart of romaine lettuce, cut into 1/4 inch slices
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
1/2 tomato, halved and sliced
1/4 cup kalamata olives
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
**Tzatziki Sauce**
1 cucumbers
200g strained yogurt
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 tbsp. wine vinegar
pinch salt
fresh dill, chopped

Directions:
Place boneless chicken breasts in a shallow glass container.
Season with thyme or oregano, pepper, garlic, oil, lemon (juice and zest), salt and olive oil and rub over chicken well.
Allow to marinade in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
Remove chicken from marinade and place on prepared grill. Discard remaining marinade.
Cook chicken until juices run clear, about 8 minutes on each side. Remove chicken from heat,
and allow to rest about 10 minutes before cutting into strips.
Place pita rounds on the grill, and cook for about 2 minutes, until warm, turning frequently to avoid burning.
Stuff pita pockets with chicken, toppings and tzatziki to serve.
For Txatziki sauce:
Peel cucumbers and grate each one length-wise with course grater.
Salt, allow to drain and press out excess liquid from grated cucumbers.
Peel garlic cloves, remove sprout if it exists and crush them.
Mix cucumber, garlic, vinegar and salt.
Fold the yogurt and the olive oil into the mixture
