Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
1 teaspoon capers, drained and chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/8 teaspoon white sugar
1 pound 85% lean ground beef
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 small slices (0.5 oz) Cheddar cheese, quartered
12 mini brioche buns, split
1 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded
6 cherry tomatoes, sliced
3 cornichons (tart pickled gherkin cucumbers), sliced

Directions:
Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high (400 to 450 degrees F (200 to 230 degrees C)).
Stir together mayonnaise, red onion, ketchup, vinegar, capers, parsley, thyme, and sugar in a small bowl until combined.
Place beef in a large bowl. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Mix by hand until just combined. Make 12 meatballs by rolling beef mixture between your palms; transfer to a baking sheet. Flatten tops slightly. Drizzle with oil and season both sides with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Arrange patties on oiled grates; grill, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Flip, then top each with 1 piece cheese. Grill, uncovered, until cheese is melted and beef is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, put buns, cut-sides down, on grate; grill until toasted, about 1 minute.
Top bun bottoms with a small spoonful of sauce. Add a patty, shredded lettuce, tomato slices, cornichon slices, and bun tops.
