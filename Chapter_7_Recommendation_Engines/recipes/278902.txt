Description: 
A substitute for the famous browning sauce. I use all vegan and gluten-free ingredients. I made this up to use for pot roast. It can be used anywhere Kitchen Bouquet® is required or just to make tasty gravies. Add 1 tablespoon to recipes calling for browning sauce. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Add a little oil on top and it will keep longer.
