Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth
1 cup water
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons honey
1 tablespoon curry powder
2 tablespoons minced red onion
1/2 cup raisins
sea salt to taste
1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds

Directions:
Bring the quinoa, vegetable broth, and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.
While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the dressing by whisking together the orange juice, lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, honey, and curry powder in a mixing bowl. Stir in the cooked quinoa, red onion, and raisins; season to taste with sea salt. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator several hours until cold.
Stir in half of the toasted almonds immediately before serving. Sprinkle the remaining almonds over top to serve.
