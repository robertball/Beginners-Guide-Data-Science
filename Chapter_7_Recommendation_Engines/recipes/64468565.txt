Ingredients:
5 cups vegetable oil, for frying
1 cup milk
1 large egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 Tablespoons sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
Jam of various flavors
Frosting of various flavor
Whipped Cream
Sugar
Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot until oil is at 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with paper towels.
In a small bowl, whisk together the milk and the egg.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the milk-egg mixture. Add the melted butter, mixing until a soft dough forms.
Once the oil has reached 350ÂºF, use a small ice cream scoop or two spoons to drop about 1 tablespoon scoops of dough into the oil.  Do not overcrowd the pan, as the bites will double in size.  Fry the bites, flipping them in the oil, for about 2 minutes or until they're golden brown. Transfer the bites to the baking sheet with a slotted spoon.
Options:
Let the bites cool slightly. Place in a shallow pan and sprinkle with granulated sugar, powdered sugar, or a combination of cinnamon and sugar. Using a small syringe, inject with your favorite jam or frosting.  Serve immediately.
Let cool completely, top with whipped cream.  Using a small syringe, inject with your favorite jam or frosting.  Serve immediately or refrigerate.

Description: 
This was an item for GISHWHES, and I had a lot of fun putting it together!  It's essentially donut holes, with filling.  Because who doesn't love that???  

For fun with kids in the kitchen, let them inject the bites with their own favorite fillings!
