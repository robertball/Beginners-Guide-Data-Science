1 can beer of your choice
1 tsp cumin
1 T paprika
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp seasoned salt
1 tsp minced dried garlic
3 T olive oil
freshly ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill or oven to 400 degrees. Drink 1/2 the beer so the can is 1/2 full. Grind seasonings together. Loosen skin of chicken to make pockets under it and pour olive oil in. Pat the seasoning mix onto the bird.  Grill or bake until done.
