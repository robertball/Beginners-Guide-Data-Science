Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon water
2 cups cherry juice
1 teaspoon agar-agar

Directions:
Dissolve the cornstarch in the water in a small cup or bowl and set aside. In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2  cups of cherry juice and agar-agar powder. Let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Set heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 1 minute.
Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining juice along with the cornstarch mixture until no longer cloudy. Pour into small serving cups and refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
I've experimented with these a lot and have finally found a combination that comes out as stiff as gelatin desserts but are completely vegan.  Works well as a substitute for gelatin in other recipes or just as treats on it's own. Half of a cup of chilled juice can be replaced with your favorite liquor to make a cocktail.
