Ingredients:
1 1/2 Tbs olive or coconut oil
1 (6") zucchini, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 red onion, diced
1 Tbs fresh thyme
1/2 tsp sea salt, divided
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper, divided
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium tomato, seeded and chopped
9 large eggs

Directions:
Heat coconut oil in a 10" oven-proof skillet over medium heat.  When hot, add zucchini, pepper, onion, thyme, 1/4 tsp sea salt, 1/8 tsp pepper and garlic.
Cover and cook until vegetables are tender (about 5-7 minutes), stirring occasionally.
Stir in tomato.  Cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes more or until liquid evaporates.
Combine eggs and remaining salt and pepper and whisk until frothy.
Pour eggs over vegetable mixture and stir gently. Cover, reduce heat and cook 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat broiler to low. Finish frittata with 3 minutes under the broiler (until fully set).
Invert onto a plate, slice and serve warm or cold.
