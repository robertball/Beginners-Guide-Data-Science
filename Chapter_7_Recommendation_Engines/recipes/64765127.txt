Ingredients:
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cups warm water
8 g pkg active dry yeast
1 egg
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 tsp. salt
4 1/2 cups flour
Filling:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
~3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 tbsp. cinnamon, if making the cinnamon variety
Topping:
1 1/2 cups whipping cream
1 1/2 cups brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 170, then turn off.
Stir sugar into water in large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over top. Let stand x 10 min. Stir to dissolve yeast.
Mix in egg, oil & salt.
Work in enough flour until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Turn onto floured surface & knead 6-8 min. until smooth & elastic.
Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Roll each to ~1/4" thick (9" x 12") rectangle.
Spread 1/4 cup softened butter over each rectangle. Then sprinkle 1/2 the brown sugar evenly over the butter.
Roll along the long side. Cut each portion into 12 even slices, laying each, cut side down, in a greased 9"x 13" pan. (12/pan).
Place in oven with light on, covered with tea towel, to rise x 1 hour +, until doubled in size.
Mix topping ingredients together and pour evenly over both pans. This is enough for two 9" x 13" pans.
Bake @ 350 x ~20 min.
Turn out of pans onto cookie sheets after 5-10 min.

Description: 
My go-to recipe for yeast rolls made with cinnamon or butterscotch rolls (sans-cinnamon). 
It's faster with only 1 rise to wait for & I love this gooey version made like my Gma used to ! You can leave the whipping cream/sugar topping off, but really?, why would you? lol
(This makes TWO 9 x 13 pans or 24 rolls)
