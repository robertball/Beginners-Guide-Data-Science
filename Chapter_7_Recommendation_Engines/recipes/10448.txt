Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup molasses
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix together the brown sugar, peanut butter, butter, molasses and egg in a large bowl.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, ginger, cloves and salt.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until well blended.
For each cookie, shape a generous tablespoon of dough into a ball and roll in granulated sugar.  Place the cookies 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or until just set.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Plump sugar-topped cookies that  taste just like Mary Jane candies.  I tone down the ginger and cloves for my toddlers.
