Ingredients:
1 (13 oz.) can evaporated milk (chilled)
1 (3 oz.) package lime gelatin
1 1/4 cup boiling water
1/3 cup sugar
1/8 tsp. salt
4 tblsp. fresh lemon juice, plus grated rind of one lemon
2 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/3 cup melted butter or margarine
2 tblsp. powdered sugar

Directions:
Be sure to chill evaporated milk overnight.
Dissolve gelatin in boiling water. Mix in sugar, salt, lemon juice, and rind. Refrigerate until slightly set, about 45 minutes to an hour.
Once gelatin is slightly set, whip using an electric mixer.
In another bowl, beat chilled evaporated milk until stiff. Mix in jello mixture and beat together until thoroughly mixed.
In another bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs, powdered sugar, and melted butter. Press 1/2 of the crumb mixture onto bottom of 13x9 baking dish. Pour gelatin mixture over crumbs, speading evenly. Sprinkle remaining crumbs over gelatin.
Chill until set, approximately 4 hours.

Description: 
This is a great summer recipe! The term light refers to the consistency, rather than the calories - however, I have made this using sugar-free gelatin, light margarine, and a sugar substitute, without any difference in taste.
