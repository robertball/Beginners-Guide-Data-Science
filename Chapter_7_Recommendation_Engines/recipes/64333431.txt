Ingredients:
1 pound mussels
3 cups water + 2 Tbsp flour
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
2 Tbsp olive oil
2-3 chopped shallots
2 cloves minced garlic
¼ cup chopped canned tomatoes
pinch saffron threads
2 Tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
? cup white wine
¾ teaspoons kosher salt
? teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
To clean the mussels, put them in a large bowl with the water and flour and soak for 30 minutes, or until the mussels disgorge any sand. Drain the mussels, then remove the "beard" from each with your fingers. If they're dirty, scrub the mussels with a brush under running water. Discard any mussels whose shells aren't tightly shut.
Heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook for 3 minutes, or until the shallots are translucent.
Add the tomatoes, saffron, parsley, thyme, wine, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.
Add mussels, stir well, then cover the pot. Cook over medium heat for 8-10  minutes (until mussels are all open).
Shake the pot a few times with the lid on, then pour entire contents into a bowl to serve.
