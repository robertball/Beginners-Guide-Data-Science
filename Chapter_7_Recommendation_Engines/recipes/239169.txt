Ingredients:
4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
4 ounces Neufchatel cheese (such as Organic ValleyÂ®), softened
1/2 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with cold water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer potatoes until tender, about 20 minutes; drain and transfer potatoes to a large mixing bowl.
Beat potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth; add cream cheese and beat again until smooth. Season potatoes with sea salt.

Description: 
This is a healthier and not-so-sweet option for those who prefer sweet potato fries to sweet potato pies. I use organic ingredients, but it is not required!
