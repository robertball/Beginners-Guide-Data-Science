Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef (85/15)
1 pound frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
2 packets brown gravy mix ( I use McCormicks)
1 medium onion, chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 bottles Stout Beer (use whatever you like, example Founders Breakfast Stout is what we use, but any will work)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cups sharp cheddar cheese
3 pounds baking potatoes
1/2 cup milk
1 stick butter
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375.
Boil the potatoes in salted water until fork tender. Drain completely.
In a medium mixing bowl, mash together the butter and potatoes. Add milk to desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to your liking. Set aside.
Cook and drain ground beef. Place meat back in skillet and add 1 bottle of the beer, and cook until most of the alcohol is evaporated. Add tomato paste.
In a medium sauce pan, prepare gravy according to instructions, but replace 1 of the cups of water with beer. Simmer until thick.
Add gravy to meat mixture, and cook together on low until you get a nice thick gravy.
In a medium skillet with the olive oil, cook onions until soft and translucent.  Add the mixed vegetables to the onions and cook until warm throughout.
In a 2 quart baking dish, add meat as bottom layer, then add veggies, then the mashed potatoes.
Top with shredded cheese and cook until the cheese is bubbly, about 30 minutes.
