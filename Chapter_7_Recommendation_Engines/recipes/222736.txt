Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1/2 cup fresh blueberries
1/2 cup peach preserves
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/3 cup rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup olive oil
2 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite size pieces
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2/3 cup chopped green onions
4 cups frozen mixed vegetables
4 cups cooked brown rice
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Place garlic, blueberries, peach preserves, sesame oil, mustard, vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce in a blender; cover and blend until smooth.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat; cook and stir chicken and mushrooms until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 7 minutes. Stir in ginger, garlic salt, and black pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Toss green onions and mixed vegetables with chicken; pour blueberry sauce over vegetable mixture. Continue cooking on medium-high heat until sauce comes to a boil, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook until vegetables are tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and allow sauce to cool for 3 minutes. Serve over brown rice and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Description: 
This tangy, sweet, and savory recipe is excellent for either a stir fry sauce or a lovely salad dressing. This was thrown together in an effort to use blueberries that had failed to make it into dessert...and thus this tasty dish is born!
