2 cans of chopped clams, drained, reserving 1/2 of the juice.
1 small can of black olives, drained, reserving 1/4 of the juice.
1 small can of sliced mushrooms, drained, reserving 1/4 of the juice.
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
3 tablespoons of Extra Virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon of Extra Virgin olive oil
Pinch of salt
1/2 pound dry linguine

Directions:
In a large pot of water add salt and a teaspoon of olive oil. Bring water to boil and add the linguine. Cook until just shy of being done.

Drain the pasta and add it to the fry pan, stirring to coat.
