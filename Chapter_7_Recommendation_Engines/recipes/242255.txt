Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups white sugar
1 cup water
3 (.25 ounce) envelopes unflavored gelatin
2 teaspoons rose water
1 dash red food coloring, or desired amount
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Line a 9-inch cake pan with enough aluminum foil to have it hanging over the sides; spray with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.
Stir sugar, water, and gelatin together in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook at a simmer, stirring constantly, for 20 minutes.
Stir rose water and food coloring into the mixture in the pot; pour directly into the prepared cake pan.
Cover pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Lightly dust a cutting board with some of the confectioners' sugar. Invert cake pan onto the cutting board. Gently peel aluminum foil from the surface of the gelatin. Cut gelatin into squares.
Spread confectioners' sugar into a wide, shallow dish. Roll gelatin squares in the sugar to coat.
