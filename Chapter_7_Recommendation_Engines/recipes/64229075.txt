Enough water to barely cover meat

Directions:
Put pork, potatoes, onion, garlic, pickling spice in cheese cloth, salt & pepper in a pot and add water to cover. Cook stirring often until the meat is grey and hot. Simmer for 30 minutes or until the water has cooked down. Remove pickling spice bag. Add remainder of the spices and the bread crumbs and mix well. Adjust seasonings to taste. Cool.
