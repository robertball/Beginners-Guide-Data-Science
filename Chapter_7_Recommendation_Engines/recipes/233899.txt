Ingredients:
Mango Salsa:
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and chopped
1 cup chopped tomato
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup diced red pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon cider vinegar
1 dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 taco shells
4 (6 ounce) mahi mahi fillets, cut into 1-inch slices
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Stir mango, avocado, tomato, red onion, red pepper, parsley, canola oil, brown sugar, lime juice, cider vinegar, hot pepper sauce, salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl. Refrigerate salsa for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat taco shells in preheated oven until crisp, about 5 minutes.
Season mahi mahi with 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook mahi mahi in olive oil until fish flakes easily, about 3 minutes per side.
Place mahi mahi slices in taco shells and top with mango salsa.

Description: 
A very healthy and Hawaiian-style fish taco. For a heartier taco add some coleslaw on top of the mango salsa. If you don't have Mahi-Mahi, substitute any firm, thick white fish.
