Description: 
This is my mom's recipe, and it is delicious!  It can be served as either a salad or dessert.  This recipe can also be used to make parfaits.  Simply layer the salad, extra whipped topping, crushed cookies and repeat.  Top parfaits with a dollop of whipped topping.  Or, to serve as a pie, pour into a graham cracker or cookie crust and chill before serving.
