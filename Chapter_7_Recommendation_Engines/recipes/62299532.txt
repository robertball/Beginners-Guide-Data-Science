Ingredients:
1 lb Pork Sausages
1/2 lb Thick-sliced bacon, chopped into cubes
2 Cups of Vegetable Stock
2 lbs Potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch thick rounds
2 Onions, thinly sliced
2 Tbs Chopped fresh parsley
1 tsp Cornstarch
3 Tbs Water
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Gently Brown the sausages and the bacon on a hot pan.
2. Put the sausages, bacon and stock or water to a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Remove the meat to a bowl and reserve the broth.
3. Bring broth to a boil, mix the cornstarch with the water to make a thin paste and stir the paste into the broth to slightly thicken it.
4. Spread one-third of the potatoes on the bottom of a stovetop casserole dish or a large saucepan. Add a layer of half the onions and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Cut the sausages in 3 or 4 pieces and spread a layer of half the sausages and half the bacon over the onions.
5. Follow by another layer of potatoes, onions, sausages and bacon and finally a top layer of potatoes. Season with salt and pepper and pour over the reserved broth.
6. Set over low heat, cover and simmer for about an hour.
7. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve.
