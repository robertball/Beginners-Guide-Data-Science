Ingredients:
Rolls:
3 cups almond flour
1 cup chestnut (or chia) flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup melted butter
2 tablespoons real maple syrup
2 large eggs
Filling:
1/4 cup maple sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg, allspice,ginger
1/2 cup currants
Glaze:
1/4 cup coconut butter
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon maple sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 340 degrees.  Combine your flours, salt, and soda.  Meanwhile, melt your butter and whisk together with syrup and eggs.  Blend these together and roll the dough into a rectangle between two sheets of parchment.  (If it feels too soft, toss into the freezer for about ten minutes.)
Stir together maple sugar with spices.
Carefully peel back the top parchment sheet and sprinkle  with maple sugar mixture, then currants.
Use the bottom sheet of parchment to help you roll a tight log from short-end-to-short-end.  (I found it very difficult to roll as tightly as I'd like, but the rolls baked up wonderfully nonethless!)
Once you have a roll, carefully wrap with the parchment and "log roll" it a bit tighter.  If needed, chill for an additional few minutes, to make slicing easier.  Slice your dough roll into 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Bake at 340 degrees for about ten minutes.  You'll want these soft in the middle and just starting to get golden on top.
Meanwhile, warm and blend together ingredients for glaze.
Remove baked rolls from oven and let cool for ten minutes.  Drizzle with glaze and serve!
