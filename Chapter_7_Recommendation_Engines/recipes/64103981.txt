Ingredients:
1 12oz package grated sharp cheddar cheese at room temperaure
1 c pecans, chopped
1 med vidalia onion, finely chopped
4-6 T Mayonaise
2 8oz pkgs cream cheese, softened
1/2 c apricot preserves
1/2 c frozen spinach, thawed
1/2 t garlic salt
1/2 t oregano
2 beef bullion cubes, crushed fine
1/2 t basil
dash pepper, celery seed, cumin and nutmeg

Directions:
Mix the first four ingredients and put half of the mixture in the bottom of a dish.  I used a spring form pan lined with plastic wrap for easy removal.  Mix 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese and the apricot preserves and add as the next layer.  Mix the remaining cream cheese and other ingredients and add as third layer.  Top with the remaining cheddar cheese, pecan, and onion mixture.  Refrigerate until ready to serve, at least an hour or as long as overnight.
