Description: 
Quite easy for an intermediate chef like me!  I added 1 tbs Italian seasoning to it (instead of parsley) and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I increased the breadcrumbs slightly because the plant was large.  It was very tasty and my husband loved it!Modified from: Eggplant with Mushroom Stuffing
