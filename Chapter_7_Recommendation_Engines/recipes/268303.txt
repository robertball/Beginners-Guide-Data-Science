Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) bars 85% dark chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon melted chocolate into a small resealable plastic bag and cut off a small corner.
Pipe Christmas tree shape onto the parchment paper and allow to harden in a cool place overnight.
Once the chocolate has hardened, carefully remove chocolate trees from paper and use to decorate Christmas cakes or desserts.

Description: 
It is easy to make chocolate Christmas trees and they make great toppers for Christmas cakes, cupcakes, or desserts. The finished trees are fragile and melt easily, so I usually wear plastic gloves when handling them.
