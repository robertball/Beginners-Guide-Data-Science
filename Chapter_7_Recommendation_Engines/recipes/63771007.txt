Ingredients:
1/4 cup kosher or coarse salt
1 tablespoon black pepper, ground
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons oregano leaves, dried
2 teaspoons granulated garlic
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Mix ingredients together in bowl and apply rub to brisket 2 to 4 hours before cooking. Refrigerate meat for a minimum of 4 to 6 hours to enhance flavor. This rub can be stored for several months in an air tight container, in a dark, cool place.

Description: 
This rub starts with a good portion of salt, but don't worry. By using a coarse salt it will absorb slower into the meat. This means that the brisket won't pick up too much of the saltiness. Don't apply this rub too early or the surface of the meat will begin to cure.
