Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 cup butter, sliced
2 cups pumpkin puree

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Butter one large cookie sheet.
Stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in the pumpkin and mix to form a soft dough.
On a lightly floured surface pat the dough out to 1/2 inch thick. Cut out biscuits with a round 2 inch cutter. Place biscuits on the prepared cookie sheet.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm from the oven.
