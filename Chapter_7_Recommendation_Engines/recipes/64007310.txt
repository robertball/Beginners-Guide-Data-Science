Ingredients:
1 lb carrots (6 medium) peeled and sliced 1/4" thick on the bias
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 T sugar
1/2 tsp table salt
1 T butter, cut into 4 pieces
2 tsp lemon juice
Pepper

Directions:
Bring carrots, broth, 1 T of sugar, and salt to boil in covered 12" non-stick skillet, over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until carrots are almost tender when poked (apx 5 minutes).
Uncover, increase heat to high, and simmer rapidly, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 2 T (1 to 2 minutes).
Add butter and remaining 2 T of sugar.  Toss carrots to coat and cook, stirring frequently, until carrots are completely tender and glaze is a light gold (apx 3 minutes).
Remove from heat, add lemon juice, and toss to coat.  Transfer to dish, season, and serve.
