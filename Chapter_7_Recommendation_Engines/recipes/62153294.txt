Ingredients:
2 green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed
½ lb. ground beef
½ c. long grain white rice
1c. water + 2/3 c. water (separated)
1/3 c. low sodium soy sauce
½ can (14.5 oz.) petite diced tomatoes + 1/3 c. of the juice
1 small shallot, thinly sliced
1/8 c. large shred carrots
2 tbsp honey
½ tbsp minced ginger + 1 tsp grated ginger (I used 1 tbsp minced because I really like ginger, but I would suggest starting with ½ tbsp and adding more to your liking)
½ tbsp toasted sesame seeds
pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°.
Cook ½ c. rice in 1 c. water according to directions, set aside.
In a large pot add enough water to cover peppers and bring to a boil.
Boil peppers for 5 minutes and remove from water.  Set aside to cool.
Brown the meat with shallot, carrots, and ginger.
In a small saucepan combine soy sauce, tomato juice, 2/3 c. water, honey, sesame seeds, and a little ground black pepper.
Simmer sauce for 5 minutes.
Once beef is done, drain any fat and add the tomatoes.
Heat beef mixture and add rice.
Place peppers in a 9x9 baking dish.
Fill peppers halfway with beef mixture.
Add juice to cover.
Fill peppers to the top and cover with remaining sauce.
Cover pan with foil (try to tent it so the foil is not touching the peppers).
Cook 30-35 minutes until peppers are tender.
Serve and enjoy!
