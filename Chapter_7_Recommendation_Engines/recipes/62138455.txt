Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add linguine and cook for 10 minutes or until al dente.
Drain and return to pot.
In a large skillet on medium heat, while pot is heating up add pieces of chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes.
When the water starts boiling, then add tomatoes, basil, chives and garlic and 1/2 tbsp of olive oil to bring the flavours together.
