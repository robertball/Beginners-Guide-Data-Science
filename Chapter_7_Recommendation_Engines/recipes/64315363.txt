Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1 cup frozen corn
1 cup frozen green peas
1 cup diced potato
1 cup celery, chopped
Chicken Stock
2/3 cup butter
2/3 cup chopped onion
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tsp. garlic pepper
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/3 cup milk
2 (9 inch) Pillsbury Ready Crusts pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
In a saucepan, combine chicken, potatoes and celery. Add Chicken Stock to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Add corn and peas for just a few minutes at the end. Remove from heat, drain (save liquid) and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, garlic pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth (use saved stock and add additional stock or broth as needed) and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Add sauce to chicken mixture, then pour into bottom pie crust in a deep dish pie plate. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
