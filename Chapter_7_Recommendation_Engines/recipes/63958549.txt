Ingredients:
1 1/4 lbs. boneless skinless chicken
2 (15 oz) cans great northern beans
1 (15 oz) can white corn
1 envelope taco seasoning
1 small can chopped green chilies
1 can of cream of chicken soup
1 (14 oz) can chicken broth
1/2 cup sour cream
pepper jack cheese

Directions:
If you have crock pot you can layer everything except the last two.  Mix the taco seasoning, chilies, soup and broth and then pour over.  The chicken can be raw.  I usually cook the chicken first and then just heat it up on low in the crock pot.  If you put it in raw it needs to cook on low for 8-10 hours, cooked chicken it can go on low for 3-4 hours or you can do it on the stove to get it done quicker.  Add the sour cream and cheese a little bit before you're going to serve and let it melt and mix in.
