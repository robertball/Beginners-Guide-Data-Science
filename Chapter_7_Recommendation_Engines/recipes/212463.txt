Ingredients:
2/3 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can 100% pure pumpkin
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, divided

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and lightly grease 2 loaf pans, 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch size.
Stir together the oil, eggs, and pumpkin in a large bowl. Stir in the white and brown sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, and stir to combine well. Beat in the flour and 1 1/2 cups of oats.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans, and sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1/4 cup of oats. Press the oats lightly into the top of the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a loaf comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before slicing.
