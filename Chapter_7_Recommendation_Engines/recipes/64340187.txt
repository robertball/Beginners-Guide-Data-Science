Ingredients:
2 cups bread flour (you can also use all-purpose)
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp active dry yeast
1/8 cup hot water (but not boiling)
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 cup warm milk
1/2 cup greek yogurt
Topping
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tbsp cilantro leaves, chopped
1/8 cup melted butter

Directions:
Take a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt
In a deep mug, dissolve the yeast in the hot water. Add the sugar, and stir it until they are dissolved. Let it rest for about 10 minutes (it should start smelling like bread already!)
Once the yeast is foamy and almost double in size, add the warm milk and yogurt
Pour wet mixture to the dry ingredients mixture and mix well
Using your hands, knead and form into a soft ball (it will feel weird and sticky but thatâ€™s how it should feel)
Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let it rest for at least an hour or until it doubles in volume
Heat your oven to broil on 500 degrees
Punch down the dough lightly and divide it into 4 portions
Using your hands (and some loose flour), shape into individual round balls
On a well floured surface, use a rolling pin and roll each ball until 1/4 inch thick
Place rolled out dough on a well-greased baking sheet
Brush each piece with melted better and top with chopped garlic and cilantro
Bake for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown
Flip naans over and cook the other side for an additional 2-3 minutes
Brush with more butter if desired and serve hot
