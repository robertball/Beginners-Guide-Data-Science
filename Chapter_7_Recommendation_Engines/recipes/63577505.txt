Ingredients:
1 cup unsweetened coconut strips (Nifty Nuthouse)
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1 can coconut milk
half-and-half to equal 3 cups
3 egg yolks, beaten
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup corn starch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked (perfect butter pie crust recipe)
1 cup stabilized whipped cream icing (separate recipe)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and bake it, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Set aside for topping the pie.
In a medium saucepan, combine the half-and-half, eggs, sugar, corn starch and salt and mix well. Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the sweetened flaked coconut and the vanilla extract.
Pour the filling into the pie shell and chill until firm, about 4 hours.
Top with whipped topping and with the reserved coconut.
