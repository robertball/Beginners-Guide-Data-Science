Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups low-fat milk

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir in the ground beef, chicken bouillon, garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes.
Stir in the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the milk and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes to thicken.

Description: 
A Recipe that is always requested from my kids when they come and visit. I spent 20 years of my 28 years in the Air Force in the dining hall. I think I have perfected SOS (Creamed Beef).Very simple and quick. Serve over toast (Shingles) or biscuits or hashed brown potatoes. I know leaving the grease in is not real healthy but it really makes it tasty. If you use anything other then HAMBURGER or drain the grease it will not turn out.
