Ingredients:
8 sweet potatoes
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
4 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup orange juice
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons grated orange peel
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes in a Dutch oven or soup kettle and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes or until tender. Drain. When potatoes are cool, peel and cut into 1/2-in. slices. Arrange in a greased shallow 3-qt. baking dish; set aside.
In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, salt and cinnamon. Stir in the orange juice, honey, butter, water and orange peel. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in walnuts. Pour the mixture over the potatoes. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until heated through.
