Ingredients:
1 CUP Softened butter
1 CUP Sugar
1 CUP Eggnog
1 Egg, beaten
3 and ¾ CUP Flour
1 tsp Baking powder
1 tsp Baking soda
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Nutmeg
Frosting
1 and ½ CUP Powdered sugar
1/4 -1/2 CUP Eggnog
1 tsp Light Karo Syrup

Directions:
Mix together butter and sugar.
Add in eggnog and egg.
Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg.
Chill for atleast one hour.
Drop by teaspoonfuls (I rolled mine for a second) onto greased baking sheet.
Bake at 350°F for 8-10 minutes.
When you pull them out out the oven, push tops with the bottom of a greased flat bottom glass to flatten a bit.
Cool on drying rack.
Frost with eggnog frosting and sprinkle with nutmeg.
Enjoy!
