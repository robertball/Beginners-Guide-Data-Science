Ingredients:
1/2 gallon 1% milk (or whatever you want)
1 packet non fat dry milk
1 cup Greek yogurt

Directions:
Turn on empty crockpot to warm up really well.
Cook over stove, 64 oz. 1% milk, 1 packet non fat dry milk, (this makes it thick) till it reaches 185 F.
Remove from heat.
Let cool to 125 F.
Add 1 cup greek plain yogurt.
Pour all into crockpot, turn crockpot off, wrap in heavy towles for 6-8 hours. The longer it sits the "stronger" it gets. I like 6 hrs.
The last batch I made I added 1/4 cup raw sugar while cooking, added almond extract, touch of cinnamon at the 125F stage along with the "starter" yogurt.
I am trying to calculate the overall sugar content in 6 oz., still gotta be less than the flavored....:)
