Ingredients:
3/4 Cup Wheat Germ
1-1/2 Cups Oatmeal flakes
6 Large Fresh Lemons, juiced
2 Teaspoons Lemon Zest
1/2 Cup Water
1-3/4 Cups Fresh Ripe Cherries, pitted & sliced
1 Cup & 2 Tablespoons Sugar, divided
2-1/4 Cups All-Purpose Flour, sifted
1-1/2 Tablespoons Baking Powder
1/2 Teaspoon Ground Ginger (optional)
1 Teaspoon Cinnamon
1/2 Cup Soy or Vegetable Oil
6 Tablespoons Salted Butter, softened
3 Extra Large Eggs, beaten
3/4 Cup Plain Greek Yogurt

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 400 degrees F. Grease muffin pan or use paper liners. Have 2 small bowls & 1 large bowl available for preparation.
In small bowl combine Wheat Germ, Oatmeal, Lemon Zest, Juice, Water, 1/3 Cup sugar. Mix well & set aside.
Now the fun part, remove stems & pits from cherries. Slice some cherries in half and some in quarters. (The mixture of different sizes add such a nice texture in both appearance & taste to the finished product) These sliced cherries should measure 1-3/4 cups, place into separate small bowl, stir in 2 Tablespoons Sugar & set aside.
In Large Bowl combine & sift together 2/3 Cup Sugar, Flour, Baking Powder, Ginger & Cinnamon. Add Wheat Germ/Oatmeal mixture, then mix in Oil, Butter, Eggs & Yogurt. Batter will be thick, fold in cherries.
Spoon mixture into greased muffin pan cups to 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until top begins to brown & toothpick comes out clean, about 18 - 20 minutes.
Let cool about 5 minutes before removing muffins from pan. Serve warm or cooled, tastes great both ways.
