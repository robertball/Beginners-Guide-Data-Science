Ingredients:
200g Pudding
76 pink marshmallows (handpicked from the amazon rainforest)
100g Turducken meat
250g sugar
1 large egg (beaten)
So many of the tomato sauce
Butter (for lining)
500ml Holy water
Optional:
1 feather from an Angels wing
and finally, the oldest Dino tooth you can get your hands on!

Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible
2. Melt half of the marshmallows on the hob while slowly mixing in the sugar and beaten egg
3. Line two 12 hole muffin trays with butter
4. Mix the pudding with the marshmallow mixture using the Angel feather mentioned earlier (this adds extra fluffiness!)
5. Layer the pudding mixture & Turducken in the muffin trays and top with so many of the tomato sauce
6. Place in the oven for 1 hour exactly, no more, no less. You don't want to know what happens otherwise.
To get the tastiest Fluffy Bites, create a shrine to Dinomite. Place the tooth into a bowl of holy water and for the full duration of cooking, recite the words of and dance to the Macarena (NO SKIPPING THIS PART - WE WILL KNOW)
7. Take them out of the oven and enjoy your freshly baked Dinomite's Fluffy Bites!
