Ingredients:
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup dried bread crumbs
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup eggs, beaten
1 onion, chopped
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 cup tomato juice
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together pecans, bread crumbs, cheese, eggs, and onion.  Shape into golf ball size balls.
Heat oil in an electric deep fryer or heavy saucepan to 365 degrees F ( 170 degrees C). Add cheese balls to hot oil, and fry until brown.  Fry in batches to maintain oil temperature. Transfer to an 8 inch square baking pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together tomato juice, tomato soup, and cumin.  Cover cheese balls with sauce. Sprinkle additional cheese on top, if desired.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes.
