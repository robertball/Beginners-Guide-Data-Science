Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter or margarine
2 Tbsp flour
1 1/2 cups warm milk
2 packages Buddig beef
2 slices American cheese

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Whisk in flour all at once to form a roux. Whisk in milk, a little at a time, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Bring to a boil, stir in beef and cheese. Add cornstarch mixed with milk as needed to thicken. Heat through and serve over warm, buttered toast.
