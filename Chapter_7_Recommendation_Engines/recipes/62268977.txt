Ingredients:
1 cup white navy beans, rinsed, drained, and soaked overnight in 2 quarts of water
4 cups water
1 large bunch kale, stemmed, chopped, rinsed and drained
2 quarts water
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound spicy linguica sausage, sliced
1 cup chopped shallots
4 cups chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste
hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Cook the white beans in 4 cups water. Use a pressure cooker and cook for 25 minutes then use natural release, or bring to a boil then lower to simmer for about an hour.  Set beans aside -- do not drain.
In a soup pot, bring 2 quarts water to a boil.  Add the salt, then the chopped kale.  Boil for 2 minutes, until kale is bright green and tender.  Drain kale into a strainer and cool with cold running water.  Set aside.
Return soup pot to the stove over medium-high heat.  Add olive oil and sausage and cook until browned.  Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Add chopped shallots to the soup pot and saute until soft, adding a splash of chicken broth and scraping up any browned bits from the sausage.
Once shallots are softened, add sausage, beans and their cooking liquid, and chicken broth to the pot.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
Add kale and cook for a few minutes.  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and hot sauce.
