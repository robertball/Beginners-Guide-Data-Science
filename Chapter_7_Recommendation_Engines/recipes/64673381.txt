Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, boneless, cut into 1 1/2 inch strips
1 red bell pepper (capsicum), thinly sliced
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
2 cup button mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup olive oil
2 Tbsp of Tamari gluten-free soy sauce
1/4 tsp favourite sugar substitute
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp dried ginger
Sprinkle of All Purpose Seasoning (or season mix of your choice)
2 Tbsp of Ranch Dressing/Dip (thick)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) on grill.
Place pepper, onion and mushrooms in baking dish.
Put chicken on skewers (make sure skewers are long enough for width of baking dish).
In a small bowl, mix olive oil, Tamari soy sauce, sugar substitute, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, paprika and ginger.
Add 1/3 of sauce to vegetables, stirring to cover.
Place chicken skewers across the pan of vegetables (ends of skewers will be setting on edge of dish, keeping chicken above the vegetables).
Brush about 1/3 of the sauce across chicken, using a basting brush.  Cover chicken on both sides with sauce, allowing sauce to drip into the vegetables.
Grill for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and place skewers on plate.
Stir vegetables and return chicken skewers to top of pan.
Baste chicken with remainder of sauce, again letting sauce drip onto the vegetables.
Lightly sprinkle All Purpose Seasoning onto the chicken.
Grill for 15 more minutes until chicken and vegetables are done.
Serve with tablespoon of Ranch Dressing/Dip on each plate to eat with the chicken.
