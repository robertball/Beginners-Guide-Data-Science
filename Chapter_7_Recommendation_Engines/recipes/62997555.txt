Description: 
It was my pleasure to know Stephen and share recipes with him. He had an amazing collection of them from literally around the world. While some were from books or magazines, many more were ones that people shared with him. He had a way about him that you wanted to give him all your old family recipes, knowing he would cherish them. You can find many of his recipes floating around the net to this day.
