Description: 
This has a pinch of chile pepper as the secret ingredient. It's firm yet unbelievably light and airy. The little bit of chile pepper is in there just to bring out the flavor of the chocolate and add a tiny bit of delicious heat. Garnish each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of shaved chocolate.
