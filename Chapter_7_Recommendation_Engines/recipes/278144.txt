Description: 
This is a creamy, delicious fondue! It is a hit whenever I make it. Guests get so excited to get a big piece of crab and much noise is made when it slips and falls back into the pot! Someone always ends up with a spoon scraping the pot for one last taste! Serve with French bread cubes, using a fondue fork to spear bread and swirl in fondue to coat. 

Try dipping grapes, carrot slices, or rye bread, whatever you like. 

I usually serve this fondue with a light salad.
