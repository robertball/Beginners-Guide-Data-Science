Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 ripe mangoes, peeled and chopped
3 bananas, thickly sliced
2 (6 ounce) containers fresh blueberries

Directions:
Beat cream and vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy and stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form sharp peaks. Fold mangoes, bananas, and blueberries into whipped cream.

Submitter:

Description: 
This heavenly fruit salad tossed with homemade whipped cream came about when bananas, mangoes, and blueberries were on sale for Mother's Day, and I was already whipping cream for another dish. The entire bowl was demolished by 6 people! 

This combination would also work well with a variety of fruits added or substituted in, but I particularly like the unique flavor the mangoes add.
