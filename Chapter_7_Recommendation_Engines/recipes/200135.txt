Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
2 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and cut into 8 wedges each
1 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle caffeinated citrus-flavored soda (such as Mountain DewÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Unroll the crescent roll dough, and separate the sheets into individual triangles. Roll each apple wedge into a triangle of dough, and place them into the baking dish, seam sides down.
Mix the melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl, and spoon evenly over the dough-wrapped apple slices. Pour the soda over the rolls.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned, the apples are cooked through, and the cobbler is bubbling, 45 to 50 minutes.
