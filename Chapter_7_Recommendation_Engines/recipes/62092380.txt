Ingredients:
1 medium chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cups chopped zucchini or yellow summer squash
1 4 oz. can diced green chili peppers
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
8 7-8 inch flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes

Directions:
Cook onion and garlic in hot oil in a large skillet just until tender.  Stir in squash, cook 3-5 minutes until just tender.  Stir in half of chili peppers, 1 teaspoon of chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Stir one more minute.  Remove from heat.  Set aside.
In a medium saucepan melt butter.  Stir in flour, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon chili powder and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Cook and stir about 1 minute.  Stir in milk.  Cook and stir until thick.  Remove from heat.  Stir in 1 cup of cheese until melted.  Add the rest of the chili peppers.  Stir 1/2 cup of cheese sauce into squash mixture.
Spoon 1/3 cup squash mixture down the center of each tortilla; roll up.  Place tortillas in a lightly greased 13x9 inch baking dish.  Pour remaining sauce over tortillas.  Cover and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes or until heated thoroughly.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese and the tomatoes.

Description: 
These vegetarian enchiladas are easy to make, delicious and very filling.  They are also very accomodating to modifications.  I frequently add mushrooms and other vegetables.
