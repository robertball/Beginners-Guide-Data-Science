Ingredients:
3 whole boneless chicken breasts
Marinade:
2 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
1 Tablespoon red cooking wine
a few drops sesame oil
2 Tablespooons Flour
2 Tablespoons Cornstarch
2 Tablespoons Water
1/4 Tsp Baking soda
1/4 Tsp Baking Powder
1 Tsp Vegetable Oil
Sauce for Sesame Chicken
1/2 Cup water
1 cup chicken broth
3 Tbls vinegar
3 Tbls cornstarch
3/4-1 cup sugar
2 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
1 tsp Sesame Oil
1 tsp Chili Paste, or more if desired
1 clove garlic minced
2 Tablespoons roasted sesame seeds
3 1/2- 4 cups oil for frying

Directions:
Cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes.  mix the marinade ingredients and marinate the chicken for 20 minutes.
To prepare the sauce mix together all of the sauce ingredients. Use more or less sugar depending on how sweet you want the sauce.  Pour them into a large pot and bring to a boil stirring continuously until thickened.  Turn the heat down to low and keep warm.
Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok and add the marinated pieces to deep fry.  (For a thicker coat on the chicken you may want to coat the marinated pieces in plain cornstarch before frying. I usually do half and half depending on family likes.) Drain on paper towels and repeat with remaining chicken.
Stir the sesame seeds into the sauce and gently stir the chicken into the sauce and serve.

This is the best recipe for Sesame Chicken I have had.  We love Sesame Chicken especially my 2 and 4 year old.  This taste as close to a chinese restaurant as any recipe I have tried.
