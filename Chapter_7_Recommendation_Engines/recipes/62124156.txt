Ingredients:
1 part fresh cranberries
1 part Fruit of your choice (apples, kiwis, berries, melons, pears, mangos etc)
Honey to taste
Water to taste
DO NOT USE CITRUS FRUITS!! (Too acid with cranberries)

Directions:
Soak all the fruits in water with a fruit/veggie cleaning agent for about 15 minutes (Tough & Tender suggested).  This assures that all waxes, pesticides etc are removed from your fruit.  Rinse thoroughly.
In a saucepan, cover cranberries with water.  Bring to a boil and lower heat to medium.  Keep boiling until all cranberries burst.  Cool.
While the cranberries are cooling, add the fruits in quantities as instructed by the juicer maker.  Once all the fruits are processed, add the cranberries.
Add water to the concentrate until desired taste.
If honey is added to additionally sweeten the juice, clarify in a bit of hot water before adding to the mix.  Stir and adjust quantity of honey to taste.
