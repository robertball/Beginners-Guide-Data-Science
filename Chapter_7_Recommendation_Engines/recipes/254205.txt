Ingredients:
2 fresh cayenne peppers, sliced, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
14 ounces fresh tomatoes
14 ounces fresh broccoli florets
4 cups short-cut pasta such as ditalini
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese
4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in 1 pepper.
Cut an "x" shape in the bottom of each tomato. Add tomatoes and broccoli to water. Simmer until broccoli has softened slightly and the tomato skins have separated from the pulp, about 5 minutes. Remove the tomatoes and broccoli with a slotted spoon. When tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove and discard skins.
Bring the water to a boil again. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 1 minute less than time indicated on package or 6 to 7 minutes total. Drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet. Add the broccoli, remaining sliced cayenne pepper, and tomatoes. Stir in drained pasta and cook over medium heat until heated through and blended.
Top with cheese and extra-virgin olive oil before serving.
