Ingredients:
2	packages (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach
1	cup ricotta cheese
2	eggs
2/3	cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces), divided
1	cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided
1/2	teaspoon salt
1/8	teaspoon black pepper
1/8	teaspoon ground nutmeg
3	tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
PREPARATION:
Cook spinach according to package directions. Drain well; let cool. Squeeze spinach dry; place in medium bowl. Stir in ricotta cheese. Add eggs; mix well. Add 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, 3 tablespoons flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg; mix. Cover; refrigerate 1 hour.
Spread remaining 1 cup flour in shallow baking pan. Press a heaping tablespoonful of spinach mixture between a spoon and your hand to form oval gnocchi; place on flour. Repeat with remaining spinach mixture.
Roll gnocchi lightly in flour to coat evenly; discard excess flour. Drop 8 to 12 gnocchi into large pot of boiling salted water; reduce heat to medium.
Cook, uncovered, 5 minutes or until gnocchi are slightly puffed and slightly firm to the touch. Remove gnocchi with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Immediately transfer to greased broilerproof shallow baking dish. Reheat water to boiling. Repeat with remaining gnocchi in batches of 8 to 12. Arrange gnocchi in single layer in baking dish.
Preheat broiler. Spoon butter over gnocchi; sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Broil gnocchi 5 inches from heat 2 to 3 minutes until cheese melts and browns lightly. Serve immediately. Garnish as desired.
