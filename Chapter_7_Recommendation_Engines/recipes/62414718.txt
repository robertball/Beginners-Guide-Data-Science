Ingredients:
3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
2 large eggs
1 large egg white
1/3 cup canola oil
2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce
2-1/2 cups grated zucchini
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted, optional

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat 2 standard-size (9-by-5-inch) loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves and allspice and mix well.
In a medium-size bowl, lightly beat the eggs and egg white with a fork. Add the oil, applesauce, zucchini and vanilla. Stir together, then add to the flour mixture, and stir just until blended. Do not overmix. (If using walnuts, they should be folded in just before putting mixture into baking pans.)
Pour the mixture into the prepared pans. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a sharp knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans and cool completely before slicing.
