Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 egg white
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Combine white sugar, water, lemon juice, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a thick-bottomed pot; bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the pot, and cook at a simmer for 3 minutes. Remove cover and continue cooking, stirring often, until the sugar and salt dissolve into the liquid, about 3 minutes more. Remove pot from heat and set aside to cool for 5 minutes; pour syrup into a large bowl.
Beat syrup, confectioners' sugar, egg white, and salt together in a bowl until thick, 5 to 10 minutes; add vanilla extract and beat to incorporate, about 1 minute. Add cream cheese to the bowl; beat until smooth.

Description: 
This recipe is the result of wanting fruit dip and not having most of the ingredients. When I got the ingredients and made it according to original, I discovered I preferred this one to the original. Can be served right away or chilled firm.
