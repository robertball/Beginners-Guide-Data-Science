Ingredients:
3 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken cut into strips
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1Â½ teaspoons sugar
1 dash pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
6-8oz fresh mushrooms, sliced
2-4 scallions, chopped
10oz long rice (cellophane noodles)
8oz chicken broth
4 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, sugar and pepper to create a marinade.  Add the chicken strips and refrigerate at least one hour.
Cover and soak long rice in cold water for 30 minutes.  Cut into eight lengths (smaller lengths can be based on preference).
Place a large skillet or wok over high heat.  When hot add vegetable oil and marinated chicken.  Cook until the chicken is no longer pink, turning often.  Reduce heat and add mushrooms, scallions, long rice, chicken broth and remainder of soy sauce.  Simmer until hot, stirring often (about 3 minutes).
