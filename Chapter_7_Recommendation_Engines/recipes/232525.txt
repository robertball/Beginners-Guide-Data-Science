Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
5 tilapia fillets
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup hot salsa

Directions:
Put bread crumbs into a shallow dish.
Gently press tilapia fillets into bread crumbs to coat. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded tilapia onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Cook tilapia in hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer cooked fillets to a plate.
Top each fillet with salsa; cook in microwave to get the salsa hot, about 15 seconds.
