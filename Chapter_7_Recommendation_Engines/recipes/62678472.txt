Ingredients:
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar, 1/3 cup soy sauce (I like Silver Swan), 5 tbs honey, 4 tbs sesame oil, 3 tbs chili garlic paste, 3 tbs minced garlic, 8-12 skinless bone in thighs, salt.  Chopped green onion garnish optional.

Directions:
Make marinade by combining honey, chili paste, sesame oil, vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic in bowl and mix well until honey is dissolved.   Pour 1/2 of marinade into large ziplock and add chicken, seal and mix well  Shake to coat evenly.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, turning bag a few times in the process.  Pre heat oven to 425 F.  Place remaining marinade into small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Stir frequently and thicken for 3-5 minutes.  Remove chicken from ziplock, discard marinade that chicken soaked in.  Place chicken in 13x9 baking dish and baste with 1/3 of the thickened marinade.  Bake 10 minutes, and baste with marinade.  Bake 20 additional minutes, or until internal temp of chicken reaches 165.  Remove chicken from dish, arrange on serving platter and baste with remaining thickened marinade.  Allow to sit for 5 or so minutes before serving.
