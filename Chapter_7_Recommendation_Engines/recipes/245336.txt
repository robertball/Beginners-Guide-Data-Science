Ingredients:
1/2 cup salted butter, at room temperature
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, plus extra for dusting
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, sifted
1/2 cup almonds, finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat butter and confectioners' sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt; mix briefly to incorporate. Gradually stir 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour into the creamed butter, add almonds, and mix until dough is just combined.
Shape dough into tiny crescents; place on an ungreased baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake cookies in preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
Roll cookies in sifted confectioners' sugar when cooled.
