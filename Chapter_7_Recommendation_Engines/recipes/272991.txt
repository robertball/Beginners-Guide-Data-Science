Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package Italian sausage links
2 medium onions, peeled and sliced
1 red bell pepper, cut into strips

Directions:
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, flipping every few minutes, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 10 minutes.
Transfer sausage to a plate, leaving juices behind in the skillet. Add onions and red bell pepper; cook and stir until brown and tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
