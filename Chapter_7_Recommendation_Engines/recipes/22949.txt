1/4 cup butter
1 egg
3/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
In a small bowl, beat the egg, orange juice and orange zest. Blend into the dry mixture. Stir in the cranberries and walnuts. Transfer to the loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven 65 to 70 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted at center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes, remove to wire rack and cool completely before serving.
