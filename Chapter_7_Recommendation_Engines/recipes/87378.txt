Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup roasted tahini
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup turbinado sugar
1/2 cup almond paste
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup multigrain flake cereal
2/3 cup dried sour cherries
3 tablespoons turbinado sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets, or line with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, tahini, brown sugar, 3/4 cup of turbinado sugar, and almond paste until smooth. Mix in the egg, vanilla and orange juice. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, almond meal, and cinnamon; stir into the batter until well blended. Mix in the cereal and sour cherries.
Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle the remaining 3 tablespoons of turbinado sugar over the tops.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden at the edges. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
