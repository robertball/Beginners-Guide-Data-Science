Ingredients:
2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (you may use lemon or almond flavoring instead)
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cup all-purpose flour
6   eggs
3 cup sugar
2   sticks butter, softened

Directions:
Generously grease and flour a 10-inch bundt pan.
Using an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar together until fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Alternately add flour mixture and heavy cream to butter-sugar mixture, beginning and ending with flour.  Stir in flavoring.
Pour batter into prepared pan.  Place in a cold oven, set oven temperature at 325, and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes without opening oven door.  Bake for an additional 15 minutes if necessary.  Remove from oven and cool in pan for 15 minutes.  Invert cake onto cake plate, and for a real treat, serve yourself a slice while itâ€™s still warm.
