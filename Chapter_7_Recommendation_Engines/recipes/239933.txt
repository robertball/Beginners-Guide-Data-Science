Ingredients:
12  saltine crackers, crumbled
4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
½ cup butter
12  fresh mushrooms, sliced
1  onion, chopped
½ cup chicken broth
½ cup white wine
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch dried tarragon (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour crumbled saltine crackers into a large bowl. Press chicken pieces into crackers to coat completely; let rest for 10 minutes.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken pieces in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a casserole dish.
Saute mushrooms and onion in the same skillet until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour chicken broth, white wine, salt, pepper, and tarragon into onion mixture and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Pour mushroom mixture over chicken into the casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
