Ingredients:
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 medium onion, halved and sliced
8 brussel sprouts (about 1/2 lb)
2 tsp red pepper flakes (or to taste)
1-2 tbsp balsamic glaze

Directions:
Melt butter over medium heat in medium skillet. When hot, add garlic and onions. Sautee onions until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Slice brussel sprouts about 1/4" thick and add to skillet. Use olive oil as necessary to keep vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Continue to saute for 5-10 minutes, until sprouts begin to soften and onions become translucent.
Add red pepper flakes to taste (careful, it gets spicy fast!). Cook a minute or two to let flavors mix well.
Just before serving, pour the balsamic glaze over everything and give it a good toss together. Serve hot.

Description: 
This was a recipe I got from my boss at work, and I could just hug him! I don't particularly like brussel sprouts but my husband loves them, but after trying this easy recipe I'm a believer! They've got a little kick, but the balsamic softens the spicy blow and gives these a well-rounded flavor.
