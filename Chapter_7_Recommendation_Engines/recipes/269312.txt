Ingredients:
5 medium white beets, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 (14 ounce) can water-packed artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise (such as VeganaiseÂ®)
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 stalk celery, chopped
1/3 cup macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add beets, cover, and steam until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Chill beets for at least 1 hour. Chill artichoke hearts at the same time.
Mix vegan mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and salt together. Combine beets, artichokes, celery, and macadamia nuts in a bowl. Add dressing and toss; serve chilled.

Description: 
Toothsome white beets combined with artichoke hearts and macadamia nuts. A little suggestive of a potato salad, but hardly the same.
