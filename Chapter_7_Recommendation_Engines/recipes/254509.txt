1 tablespoon mustard seed
1 tablespoon ground black pepper

Rub pork roast liberally with brown sugar mixture.
Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add pork roast; cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Transfer pork to a slow cooker. Add water, liquid smoke, and chipotle peppers.

Description: 
Before I had a smoker, I used this to satisfy my pulled pork or carnitas craving. This meat is great in pulled pork sandwiches (see my coleslaw recipe) or in tacos. If you do not have all the spice rub ingredients, just get creative and use what you have. It will still turn out great. It is always a party-favorite. Enjoy.
