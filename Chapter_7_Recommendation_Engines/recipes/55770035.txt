Ingredients:
6 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 lime, juiced
2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
cayenne pepper to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
assorted veggies
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
skewers

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, and lime juice. Season with chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Place the chicken in a shallow baking dish with half of the sauce, and stir to coat. Place veggies in a plastic bag and pour the other half of marinade over them. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.
Preheat the grill for medium-high heat. Thread chicken onto skewers w/veggies, and discard marinade.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill skewers for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear.

Description: 
I invented this recipe for a quick dinner. I only marinated the chicken for one hour, but I am sure if you marinate longer, it would taste even better.Modified from: Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs
