Ingredients:
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 very ripe banana, mashed
1/4 cup shredded zucchini
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar baking blend (such as TruviaÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch sea salt
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine water and flax seeds in a small bowl. Refrigerate until mixture thickens and has an egg-like consistency, 15 to 30 minutes. Stir in almond milk, banana, zucchini, and vanilla extract.
Mix flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar baking blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and sea salt together in a bowl. Pour in flax mixture; stir until batter is just combined.
Heat a large griddle over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Drop 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and bottoms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a baking rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.
