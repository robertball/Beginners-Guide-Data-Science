Ingredients:
2 cups brown sugar (the coarser grained the better)
one cup honey
three tablespoons lemon juice (fresh squeezed please)
two teaspoons grated ginger, or powdered if you must.

Directions:
Mix it up, spoon into a glass jar (mason jars the best if you can afford them) and store in the refrigerator.  Keeps several weeks.  A nice touch is to include the recipe with the gift so your friends can duplicate it when they use it up.

Description: 
With today's economy we need to be frugal sometimes in our gift giving.  This brown sugar scrub is  made from all edible fresh ingredients.  Mix it up, put it in a glass jar with a ribbon or raffia and give to your women friends.  I like it especially for the tops of my feet and my elbows.
