Ingredients:
5 packages chicken drumettes (rinsed and patted dry)
4 cloves minced garlic
12 oz warmed honey
1 jar chili sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 jar teriyaki baste and glaze

Directions:
Line drumettes on the bottom of 2 9x13 baking dishes. Top with garlic, honey, chili sauce and soy sauce.  Bake at 300 degrees, stirring every 20-30 minutes.  After 1 1/2 hours or when they start to look dry, add the teriyake baste and glaze (I used Kikkoman's).  Continue to bake, stirring every 20-30 minutes for another 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.  Remove when sauce is thick and dark brown.  Serve with white rice.
