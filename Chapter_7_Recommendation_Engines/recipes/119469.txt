Ingredients:
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups chopped, peeled tart apples
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, sugar and oil.  Combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt; add to egg mixture just until combined (batter will be very thick).  Stir in the apples, cranberries and walnuts.
Transfer to an 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
