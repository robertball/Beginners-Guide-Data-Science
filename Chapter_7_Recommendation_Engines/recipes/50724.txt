Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package red or blue colored instant Jell-O® mix
1 cup boiling water
1 cup vodka
1 (750 milliliter) bottle champagne

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the gelatin mix and boiling water until completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in vodka. Pour the liquid into small paper cups or portion cups. Chill until set, at least 2 hours.
Pour champagne into glasses. Break up the gelatin with a fork, and pour into a glass of champagne. A little stir gives it some 'lava' action. Drink with caution, these will sneak up on you.

Description: 
Me and my friends made this up during a party we gave about 10 or so years ago. We were drinking champagne and shooting gelatin shots. We chunked up a gelatin shot and added some to a glass of champagne.  A few years later I mentioned this idea to some guests at the restaurant where I was bartending.  About 3 months later a local bar was advertising these drinks.
