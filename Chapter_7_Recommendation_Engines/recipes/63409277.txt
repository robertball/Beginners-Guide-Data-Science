Ingredients:
1 prepared pie crust
3 eggs
1 cup heavy cream
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided
1 small head broccoli, chopped
6 strips bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 small tomato, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Precook pie crust according to package directions, on bottom shelf of oven, then let cool.
Meanwhile, cook, drain, and crumble bacon.
Preheat oven to 425.
In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, cream, nutmeg, and salt.
In crust, layer half of cheese, half of broccoli, half of bacon, then repeat layers.
Pour egg mixture over top.
Bake for 10-15 minutes.
Reduce heat to 350.
Remove quiche from oven and place sliced tomatoes on top. Cover exposed crust with foil to prevent burning. Return to oven.
Bake an additional 20-30 minutes, until a knife inserted near center comes out clean.
Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
