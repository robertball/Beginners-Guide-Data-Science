Ingredients:
---- Salmon Puffs ----
2 eggs
3/4 cup flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
Dash pepper
1/2 milk
1 tsp minced onion
1 can salmon (drained and flaked)
---- Cheese Sauce ----
4 Tbsp butter
4 Tbsp flour
2 cups milk
2 cups Sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Start cheese sauce by melting the butter in a thick saucepan. When melted, add the flour and whisk together.
Cook the butter/flour mixture on low heat for a full 4-5mins.
While the mixture cooks, combine first 6 Salmon Puff ingredients in a bowl. Mix until well blended.
Add remaining Salmon Puff ingredients and mix well.
In a pan of choice, set at least 1" of oil to medium high heat.
Add milk to the cheese sauce pan and stir constantly until the sauce thickens.
Remove the sauce pan from the heat and add the cheese. It is important to remove the pan from the heat so the cheese proteins don't seize and make the sauce gritty. If the cheese doesn't melt, it is okay to return the sauce pan to a low heat. Remove from heat when cheese is melted.
When the oil reaches 350 degrees, drop the puff mixture in by the tablespoon. Fry approximately 3 mins on each side.
Drain on paper towels.
Serve with sauce on the side.

Description: 
You wouldn't think to put salmon and cheddar together but it is quite amazing! Canned salmon in this preparation is not fishy at all. I hate salmon!
