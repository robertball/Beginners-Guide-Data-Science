Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup red wine, divided
1 pound ground beef
1 cup diced yellow onion
1 cup diced tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup minced garlic
2 tablespoons oregano
2 tablespoons basil
1 tablespoon rosemary
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce

Directions:
Melt butter with olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in butter mixture until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup red wine; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the mushrooms are very dark and shrunken in size, about 20 minutes.
Heat a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef, yellow onion, diced tomatoes, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and garlic together until the beef is completely browned, about 10 minutes; season with oregano, basil, and rosemary. Stir 3/4 cup red wine and tomato paste into the beef mixture. Pour spaghetti sauce into the pot; stir. Return mixture to a simmer and continue cooking until the flavors blend, 10 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I never have enough sauce from just a jar alone. I also like the taste of fresh ingredients. I like to combine both in this recipe! The red wine makes all the difference. Serve on favorite noodles with mozzarella cheese and mushrooms on top.
