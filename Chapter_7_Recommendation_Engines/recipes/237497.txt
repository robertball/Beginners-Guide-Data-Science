Ingredients:
3  large eggs eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon olive oil

Description: 
This mammoth plate of food features three eggs, a half-pound of meat, and more than enough spinach. Apparently a late-night patron requested his spinach omelet include a hamburger patty, and this is what happened. In respect to good ol' made-up 'Joe,' I've kept the original portions, so feel free to share with a friend or three. This version is mostly meat and spinach, but if you want something closer to a classic scramble, then cut the beef and spinach amounts in half. This is how most restaurants that copy the recipe do it!
