3 tablespoons olive oil
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
5 small green bell peppers, chopped
3 small red bell peppers, chopped
3 small yellow bell peppers chopped
3 teaspoons soy sauce
1 cup white wine
3 teaspoons lemon juice
4  eggs
4 cups creme fraiche
1 pinch paprika

salt and pepper to taste
12 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded
11 ounces Emmentaler cheese, finely shredded
3 ½ ounces blue cheese, crumbled (optional)
7 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil and saute chicken for 8 to 10 minutes. Add green, red and yellow bell peppers, and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, wine, and lemon juice.  Cover skillet, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 370 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Beat the eggs in a large bowl with the creme fraiche. Season with paprika, oregano, coriander, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix in Cheddar cheese, Emmentaler cheese, and blue cheese. Transfer mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top, and pour in enough milk to make mixture moist.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown; serve.
