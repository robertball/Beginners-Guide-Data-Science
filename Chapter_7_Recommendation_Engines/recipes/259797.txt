Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 white onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package crisp cooked bacon, crumbled
3/4 cup half-and-half
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, plus more for garnish
1/2 cup sour cream, plus more for garnish
3 tablespoons minced fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Combine potatoes, chicken broth, onion, butter, salt, and pepper in a slow cooker (such as Crock Pot(R)). Cook on High until soup flavors meld and potatoes are extremely soft, 4 to 5 hours.
Stir bacon, half-and-half, Cheddar cheese, and sour cream into the soup. Turn heat to Low setting; cook until thick and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes more.
Mash the soup in the slow cooker using a potato masher to your desired consistency. Garnish with additional Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and chives.

Description: 
The first time I decided to try making a loaded baked potato soup, I could not decide which recipe I found to use...so I combined 2 together that sounded great. It's is the best potato soup I've ever had! Anyone who's tried it cannot get enough of it.
