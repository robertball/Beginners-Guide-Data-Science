Ingredients:
1/4 cup bacon drippings
1 carrot, minced
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 poblano pepper, diced
2 jalapeno peppers, minced
1 habanero pepper, minced
2 cups chopped onion
6 cloves garlic, minced
3 pounds ground beef
2 cups tomato paste
1 cup tomato sauce
1 cup dark beer (such as Negra ModeloÂ®)
2 fluid ounces tequila
1 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons hot paprika
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons white pepper
3/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons finely grated ginger, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat bacon drippings in a heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir carrot in the hot drippings for about 3 minutes.
Stir the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, and onion with the carrot; cook and stir until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in garlic and beef; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease from the pot.
Stir tomato paste and tomato sauce into the beef mixture. Increase heat to medium-high heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes.
Pour in dark beer, tequila, and chicken broth; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in chili powder, paprika, cumin, coriander, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, white pepper, and honey. Simmer for 45 minutes to 2 hours.
Stir grated ginger into the chili about 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My unique chili recipe starts each bite with a somewhat-sweet ginger overtone which then melds into a full bodied chile spice. This recipe is the stove-top version but it can easily be done in slow cooker as well (starting with step 4).
