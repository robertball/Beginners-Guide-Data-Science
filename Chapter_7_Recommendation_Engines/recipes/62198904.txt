Ingredients:
10 pounds pre-cooked ham
1 liter cola

Remove any visible excess fat from ham.
Marinate in cola in a turkey baking bag sealed airtight overnight. Turn bag as often as possible.
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. (135 degrees C).
Drain some cola and apply liberal amounts of brown sugar. Retie bag trying to get as much air out as possible.
Place in baking dish and surround with reserved cola.
Prick a few holes in bag to let steam escape and bake according to ham directions on oven bag.
Let rest in bag for at least 15 minutes. Pour off excess juice and slice.
