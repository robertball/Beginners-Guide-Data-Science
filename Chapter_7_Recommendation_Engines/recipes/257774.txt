Description: 
The first time I had this cake was in the 1st grade when I was learning nursery rhymes. My teacher called it Mary Mary Quite Contrary's Garden. It must be enjoyable for both kids and adults, as I still remember it 16 years later! I've seen 3 other variations of this, but I felt that they needed more substance. This version has layers of chocolate cake to make it almost like a trifle. Add an artificial plant for decoration and serve with a small shovel.
