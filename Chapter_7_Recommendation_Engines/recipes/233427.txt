1 cup water
1 cup dried cherries

1 large clove garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Stir rhubarb, pineapple, water, cherries, sugar, cider vinegar, ginger, garlic, cinnamon, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper together in a heavy saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until the rhubarb is tender to the point of falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great way to use rhubarb and goes really well with pork. Also yummy on crostini with goat cheese; simply brush sliced baguette with olive oil and bake at 400 degrees F until golden brown, spread with goat cheese, and top with the chutney. Delicious! Another great use for the rhubarb chutney is as a topping for pork chops. Season chops (or pork tenderloin) with a mixture of even parts cumin, coriander, garlic powder, and salt, plus a sprinkle of cayenne; grill, then serve with the chutney. It gets raves every time!
