Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vinegar
4 eggs
2 croissants, halved and toasted
4 slices tomato
1/2 avocado, sliced crosswise
8 slices JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE® Turkey Bacon cooked according to package directions
Mornay Sauce (recipe follows)
chopped chives and sprouts
MORNAY SAUCE:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon white pepper

Directions:
Fill wide saucepan or deep skillet with about 1 1/2 inches water. Add vinegar, bring to a simmer. Adding vinegar to the water helps keep the egg whites intact while poaching. Break 1 egg into shallow cup or saucer. Gently slide egg into simmering water. Repeat with remaining eggs. Cook eggs 3 to 4 minutes or until set. Carefully remove eggs with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.
Place croissant half on each plate. Layer tomato, avocado, and egg on croissant. Drizzle with Mornay Sauce and top with bacon. Garnish with chives and sprouts.
MORNAY SAUCE: Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, stir until bubbly. Gradually stir in milk. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Continue cooking until thickened. Stir in cheeses, mustard, salt and pepper. Remove from heat and continue stirring until cheese melts.
