Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 potatoes, peeled and diced

Directions:
Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Whisk together the egg and milk in a separate bowl; stir in the flour mixture until a smooth dough is formed.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, cut the dough into bite sized pieces with scissors into the boiling water. Boil for 20 minutes; drain well.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; add the knefla and potatoes. Stirring occasionally, cook until the potatoes are tender and the knefla are golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This version of knefla is a tasty, easy German-Russian staple for dinner, comprised simply of dough and potatoes. Sometimes I add 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon to the boiling water for extra flavor. Serve with sausage, brats, or alone. Some like it with sauerkraut or breadcrumbs for garnish.
