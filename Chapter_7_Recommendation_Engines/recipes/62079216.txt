Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 lemon (juice and rind, grated)
6 tablespoons butter (NOT margarine  This is crucial.)
1/4 t. salt
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 c. seasoned Italian bread crumbs
1 box fettuccine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Trim excess fat from chicken.  Brush with Dijon mustard on both sides and dredge in bread crumbs, shaking off excess.  Place in a 13 X 9 pan.  Meanwhile, melt butter and lemon juice in small sauce pan.  Stir in grated lemon rind last minute.  Pour sauce over chicken in pan and bake for 45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.
15 minutes before chicken is done, cook pasta according to directions on box.  When done, drain pasta and return to pan.  Remove chicken breasts from baking dish and scrape butter sauce (including brown bits) into pasta and stir well.
