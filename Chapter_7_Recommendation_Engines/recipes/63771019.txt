Description: 
This is a wet rub, or as you might call it a spice paste. What ties the flavors of this barbecue rub together is a small amount of lemon juice. This acid helps break down the seasonings so that the flavors can be absorbed into the brisket. This recipe calls for hot chili powder, but you can switch to a mild one if you want to tone down the heat.
