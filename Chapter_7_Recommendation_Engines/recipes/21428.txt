Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
½ teaspoon fresh rosemary
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups chopped fresh mushrooms
¼ cup fresh parsley
3 tablespoons vegetable stock
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon Scotch whiskey

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter and saute rosemary and garlic until tender.  Stir in mushrooms and saute until juices run.  Add parsley and stir occasionally to prevent sticking.  When mushrooms are tender, stir in stock and mix well before adding cornstarch.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add whiskey and cook for 1 minute more.

Description: 
If you are like me, you buy mushrooms with the greatest of intentions, but unfortunately, they sit in the fridge and get really...weird.  This recipe is simple.  I made it up, being determined not to let my mushrooms get... weird.  The best part is that it worked, and tastes great.  Keeps well in the fridge up to 3 days.
