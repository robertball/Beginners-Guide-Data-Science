Ingredients:
Jamaican Jerk Seasoning:
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
4 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, crushed
1 tablespoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup shredded coconut
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
4 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes, drained
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped
1/2 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Stir sugar, onion powder, thyme, allspice, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in a small bowl for seasoning mix. Transfer rub to a small airtight container, reserving 1 tablespoon in a bowl for pork.  Add coconut to the remaining 1 tablespoon seasoning; stir to combine.
Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Thread pork chunks onto the skewers. Brush pork with oil, sprinkle all sides with seasoning mixture, and place in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer until an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, mash 1/3 of the mango in a medium bowl. Stir in remaining chopped mango, black beans, red onion, lime juice, honey, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Serve salsa alongside pork skewers.
