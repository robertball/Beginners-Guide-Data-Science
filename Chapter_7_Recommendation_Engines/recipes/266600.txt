Ingredients:
1/2 celeriac (celery root), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch sticks
3 cups water
1 tablespoon lime juice
Mayo Sauce:
1/3 cup vegan mayonnaise
1 tablespoon brown mustard
1 teaspoon powdered horseradish
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Put celery root in a bowl. Pour in water and lime juice. Mix and let sit for 20 minutes.
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Make the mayo sauce. Mix together vegan mayonnaise, mustard, and horseradish powder. Keep covered in the refrigerator until needed.
Drain the celery root sticks, dry, and place back into a bowl. Drizzle oil over the fries and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.
Add celery root to the air fryer basket. Cook, checking for doneness halfway through, about 10 minutes. Shake the basket and continue cooking until fries are crisp and browned, about 8 minutes more.
Serve fries immediately with vegan mayo on the side.
