Ingredients:
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1/2 onion, shredded
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon ground sage
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 large clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
4 thick cut pork chops

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, mix together vinegar, soy sauce, orange juice, onion, rosemary, sage, salt, garlic, and barbecue sauce. Place chops in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in the marinade, and seal. Refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat grill for high heat. Transfer marinade to a small saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook for several minutes.
Lightly oil preheated grill. Grill chops for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, or to desired doneness. Brush cooked marinade over chops during the final minutes of cooking.
