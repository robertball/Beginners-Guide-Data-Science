Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 egg
1 tablespoon melted butter
1/2 cup milk
4 cups sliced rhubarb
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups boiling water

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk the flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl; set aside. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Beat the egg, butter, and milk in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until moistened, then spread into the prepared baking dish. Stir together the rhubarb, 2 cups of sugar, and the water; pour into the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the dough has set and the rhubarb is bubbly, about 40 minutes.
