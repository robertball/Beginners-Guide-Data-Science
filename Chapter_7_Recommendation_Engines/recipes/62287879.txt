Ingredients:
CAKE
1 1/2 Cup All Purpose Flour
3/4 Cup Sugar
1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1/2 Cup Fat Free Milk
1/4 Cup Applesauce or plain Yogurt
1/3 Cup Egg Beaters/Smart Starts/etc
1 1/2 Teaspoon Baking Powder
1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda
1/2 Teaspoon Cinnamon
Pinch Coriander
Pam Baking Spray
Flour for pan
CRUMB TOPPING
1/4 Cup Flour
1/2 Cup Sugar
1 Tablespoon Cinnamon
1/4 Cup Fat Free Butter Substitute. COLD!

Directions:
CAKE
Add all dry ingredients into large bowl and mix thoroughly.
Make a well in the middle of dry ingredients.
Add all wet ingredients to well and bring together thoroughly.
Spray round cake pan with cooking spray and coat with thin layer of flour.
Pour cake batter into pan.
Add topping (see directions below) generously on top of cake batter.
My method is - Cook at 375F for 18 minutes, turn off oven and let cake finish cooking with residual heat, for the perfectly cooked coffee cake. This will make sure the topping caramelizes well without burning the sugars.
CRUMB TOPPING
Mix all dry ingredients together, quickly add cold imitation butter and rigorously work together but do not BLEND. The mixture should end up looking like a cinnamon colored corn meal when it is ready to go on top of the cake batter.

My son has a very rare blood disorder that turns fat in his blood stream into ammonia. Needless to say, I am always trying to make my recipes into fat free versions. This is fat free or VERY low fat.
