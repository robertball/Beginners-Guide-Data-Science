Ingredients:
2 large zucchini, sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1/2 lb mushrooms sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium frying pan heat the olive oil over medium heat and saute the zucchini, mushrooms, onion and garlic until the onion is tender.
Combine everything into a 9x12 inch casserole dish, and mix well.  Pour the spaghetti sauce over the mixture and stir well.  Top with mozzarella cheese (use more or less depending on your preference).
Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until heated through and cheese is bubbly.
