Ingredients:
2 cups biscuit/baking mix
1 (8 ounce) can cream-style corn
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a bowl, combine biscuit mix and corn until mixture forms a ball.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10-12 times. Pat into a 10-in. x 6-in. rectangle. Cut into 3-in. x 1-in. strips; roll in butter. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 450 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
