Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and pour over sweet potatoes.
Toss the sweet potatoes in the butter.
Sprinkle sweet potatoes with brown sugar, and cinnamon, and toss again.
Spread the sweet potatoes on a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil, cover with another piece of foil the same size, fold the edges to make a pouch.

Description: 
I wanted to make a side dish on the grill that was different from what we usually have, something that wouldn't create dirty dishes.  Candied sweets are a favorite, so I came up with this idea of how to do it with little clean-up.
