Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium onions, cut into medium dice
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into medium dice
2 stalks celery, cut into medium dice
1 quart chicken broth
2 cups water
1 (16 ounce) package lentils, red or brown, washed
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 (16 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained
1 (16 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
Salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil over medium-high heat in large soup kettle. Add onions; cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add remaining ingredients excluding salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, until lentils are just tender, about 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste; continue to simmer until lentils are very tender and flavors have fully blended, about 30 minutes longer.
