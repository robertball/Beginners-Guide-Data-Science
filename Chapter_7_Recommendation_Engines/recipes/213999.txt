Ingredients:
1 (6 pound) leg of lamb, at room temperature
1/4 cup butter, softened
6 cloves garlic, halved
4 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 (6 ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate, thawed
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion and mushroom soup mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Spread butter generously over the lamb, and distribute garlic clove halves over the meat. Sprinkle with rosemary and pepper. Place the lamb on a rack inside a roasting pan.
Roast the lamb in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
Mix the lemonade concentrate and dry soup mix together in a bowl, pour over the lamb, and roast an additional 30 minutes. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the lamb should read 120 degrees F/58 degrees C for medium-rare or 145 degrees F/68 degrees C for medium-well. Allow the roast to stand for about 20 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This recipe is great on the grill.  Dad uses a grill pan, and cooks according to oven directions. Usually the ham is in the oven so the grill works for us. A wonderful addition for Easter. The lamb and ham taste wonderful together. Source: Mom and Dad.
