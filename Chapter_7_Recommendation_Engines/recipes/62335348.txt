Ingredients:
8 ounces medium seashell pasta
1/2 cup Real Bacon Bits
1/2 cup Light Mayo
1/2 cup Bacon Ranch Dressing
4 green onions, chopped
4 oz Cheddar Cheese, cut in small cubes
1 tomato, chopped
1 cup Frozen Peas, thawed

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water to cool.
In a large bowl, stir together the Mayo, Ranch dressing, onion, peas and tomatoes. Mix in the cooled pasta and cheese. The pasta will absorb some of the dressing, so don't worry if it seems like too much. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
