Ingredients:
2 (12-ounce) packages frozen butternut or winter squash puree (about 3 cups), thawed
2 cups (490 grams) part-skim ricotta cheese
3/4 cup (185 grams) reduced-fat 2% milk
1 tablespoon fresh sage, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 (10-ounce or 285-gram) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 1/2 cups (170 grams) shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup (55 grams) freshly grated Parmesan cheese
9 no-boil lasagna noodles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Lightly spray a 13- x 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine squash, 1 cup ricotta cheese, milk, sage, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Combine spinach, remaining 1 cup ricotta, 1 cup (4 ounces) shredded mozzarella, and 1/4 cup (1 ounce) grated Parmesan cheese in another medium bowl.
Spread 1 1/2 cups squash mixture in bottom of baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles over sauce (noodles will appear small but will increase in size as they cook and absorb liquid). Top with 1 cup spinach mixture. Repeat 2 more times with 1 1/4 cups squash mixture, 3 noodles, and 1 cup spinach mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheeses.
Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 minutes or until lasagna is bubbly and cheese browns. Let coo1 5 minutes. Cut into 8 portions.
