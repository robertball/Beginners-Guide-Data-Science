Ingredients:
2 Tbs. olive oil
2 large yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp. cumin
1 tsp. smoked paprika
1 tsp. chili powder (adjust for taste)
1/2 tsp. oregano
5 cooked sweet Italian chicken sausages (12 oz.), cut into small chunks
1.5 pounds ground chicken or turkey
5 medium tomatillos, husks removed, washed and diced
2 Tbl. pickled jalapeno pepper slices, diced
Half of a 12-oz. bottle pale ale beer
2 cups chicken broth
14 oz. can navy or other white beans, drained
5 oz. package baby spinach leaves
Juice from 1 lime
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a large stockput, heat the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, garlic, and spices.  Saute until the onion is just tender, about 3 to 4 minutes
Add the sausage and ground chicken.  Saute 10 minutes or until the sausage and chicken begin to brown.  Add the tomatillos, jalapenos and the beer.
Bring to a simmer and cook until the beer has mostly reduced, about 2 minutes.  Add the broth and beans and return to a simmer.  Cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  After 5 minutes of simmering, add the spinach and stir until wilted.
Remove the chili from the heat and stir in the lime juice and cilantro.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
