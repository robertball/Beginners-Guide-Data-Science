Ingredients:
24 chicken wings, split at joint and tips cut off
1/2 c. butter (one stick)
2 c. dijon mustard
1 c. shredded parmesan (not the stuff in a green can)
1 T. onion powder
1/2 c. white vinegar
1 T. lemon pepper
Salt to taste

Directions:
Move rack to upper third of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.
Arrange wings in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan.
Season wings with lemon pepper and salt.
Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown and internal temperature reads 180 degrees F.
Transfer cooked wings to a large bowl.
While the wings are cooking, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Remove from heat and stir in mustard, onion powder and vinegar.
Pour sauce over wings and toss to coat.
Sprinkle parmesan over wings and toss again.
