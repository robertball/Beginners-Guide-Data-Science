Ingredients:
1-1/2 lbs. large shrimp
1 cup shredded Apline Lace Fat Free pasteurized process skim milk cheese product - for parmesan lovers
1/4 cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs
2 TBS. unsalted butter substitute
3/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions
1 TBS. minced garlic
1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes or to taste
1/3 cup minced fresh parsley
6 TBS. 2% low fat milk

Directions:
Peel the shrimp, leaving the tails on.  Then butterfly each shrimp by cutting it along the outer curved edge almost all the way through.  Open the shrimp up like a book and remove the drak vein.  In a small bowl, toss the cheese with the bread crumbs and set aside.
In a large nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat.  Add the bell pepper, green onions, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 5 minutes or until soft.  Add the shrimp and saute for 5 minutes or just until the shrimp turn pink and opaque.  Stir in the parsley.
In a small saucepan, bring the milk just to a boil, then stir into the shrimp mixture.  Stir into the shrimp mixture.  Stir in the cheese mixture and cook until cheese is melted.  Serve immediately.
