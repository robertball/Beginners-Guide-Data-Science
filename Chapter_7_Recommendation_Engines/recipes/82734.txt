Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup soy sauce
4 thick cut boneless pork chops, pounded to 1/2 inch thickness
1 quart oil for deep frying

Directions:
In a shallow dish, stir together the garlic, cinnamon and soy sauce. Place the pork chops in the mixture, and marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Fry pork chops in the hot oil until the juices run clear and they are crispy on the outside. This will only take about 2 minutes.

Description: 
My mother is famous for this recipe!  It sounds like a weird combo of flavors but it is ohhhh so good! You can also bake them if you do not have a deep-fryer, but you won't get the same crunchiness.
