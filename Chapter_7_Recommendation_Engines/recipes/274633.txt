Ingredients:
1 (30 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
1/2 pound rotisserie chicken breasts, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup salsa
1/4 cup ranch dressing
1 tablespoon buffalo wing sauce, or more to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Heat air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 2 minutes.
Add potato nuggets and cook until all pieces are cooked and crispy, shaking basket frequently, about 12 minutes. You may need to cook them in batches.
Divide potato nuggets between plates and top with even amounts of chicken, Cheddar cheese, and salsa.
Blend the ranch and buffalo sauce together in a bowl. Drizzle sauce over totchos. Garnish with cayenne pepper and cilantro.

Description: 
This appetizer takes minimal prep time thanks to ingredients like rotisserie chicken, salsa, and Tater Tots®! Make it as mild as you want for the kids, or as mouth-burning as you want for those who wish to have an inferno experience! I swapped from the traditional blue cheese to Cheddar cheese, but feel free to use any cheese you like.
