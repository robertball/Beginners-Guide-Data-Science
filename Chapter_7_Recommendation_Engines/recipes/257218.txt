Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package soft tofu, cut into 1/3-inch cubes
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
6 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil
2  spring onions, roughly chopped
1 (3/4 inch thick) slice fresh ginger, chopped
2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
1 clove garlic, minced
5 ounces ground pork
1 tablespoon doubanjiang (spicy broad bean paste)
2 teaspoons rice wine
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Place tofu in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Let sit for 1 minute; drain.
Mix water and cornstarch together in a bowl to make a runny paste.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir spring onions, ginger, peppercorns, and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in ground pork, doubanjiang paste, rice wine, and soy sauce; cook, stirring frequently, until pork is browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir drained tofu into the wok or skillet. Cook and stir until coated with sauce, about 2 minutes. Season with salt. Pour in cornstarch paste and mix well until sauce thickens, about 1 minute.
