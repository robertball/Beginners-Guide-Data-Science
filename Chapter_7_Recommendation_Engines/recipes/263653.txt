Ingredients:
1 cold apple
1 (6 ounce) container plain sheep's milk yogurt
2 tablespoons granola

Directions:
Place your knife about 1/4 inch from the stem of the apple and cut downwards. Place apple cut side-down and continue cutting straight down all around the core. Discard core and cut apple pieces into cubes.
Transfer apple cubes to a bowl. Spoon on yogurt and add granola.

Description: 
As Ben Franklin used to say, 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away.' To get a daily dose, I enjoy one of these beautiful breakfast bowls almost every morning. I sometimes garnish with diced persimmon and roasted almonds, but there's no need for honey or dried fruit - it's very satisfying without the added sugar.
