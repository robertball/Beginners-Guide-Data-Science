Ingredients:
3 lg. seedless cucumbers, about 1# each, or 4# reg. cucumbers
1 1/2 t salt
1/4 C white vinegar
1/4 C cider vinegar
1/2 C sugar or sugar substitute
1 T chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Peel cucumbers and cut in half lengthwise. Using a small spoon or a melon baller, scoop out seeds and watery center from each half, forming a shallow groove down the center.
Using a sharp paring knife, slice the cucumbers crosswise as thinly as possible, ideally about 1/8" thick
Place cucumbers in colander and sprinkle with salt. Using clean hands, toss to combine cucumbers with salt and allow to stand, refrigerated, for a least 1 hr. and up to 2hrs.
Squeese handfuls of cucumber slices to release any excess liquid and transfer to medium nonreactive bowl
In another medium nonreactive bowl, combine the white vinegar, cidar vinegar, and sugar, and stir until sugar is completely dissolved. Pour the vinegar mixture over cucumbers and add the chopped chives. Stir to thoroughly combine and serve or refrigerate up to 12 hrs. or overnight and serve cold
