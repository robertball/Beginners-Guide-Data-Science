1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
1/2 cup olive oil

Cover and chill for at least 2 hours, and preferably overnight.
Roast vegetables, on a sheet cake pan uncovered, at 400° for 20 minutes, or until the tomatoes have split and the edges of some of the vegetables are starting to crisp.
Remove from the oven and stir before returning to the oven for another 20 minutes.  At this time reduce heat to 200º and continue cooking until vegetables are tender, turning every 20 minutes.
