Ingredients:
1/2 cup raw cashews
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons agar-agar powder
1 1/2 cups soy milk
3 tablespoons almond flour
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 1/2 tablespoons miso
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place cashews in a bowl and cover with water; soak for 4 hours, or overnight. Drain.
Place 1 1/4 cups water in a saucepan over high heat; bring to a boil. Add agar-agar powder and mix well until fully dissolved. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
Combine agar mixture, soy milk, almond flour, vegetable oil, miso, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes.
Place mixture in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens, 7 to 10 minutes. Place in small ramekins, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator until set, about 2 hours. Grate before using.
