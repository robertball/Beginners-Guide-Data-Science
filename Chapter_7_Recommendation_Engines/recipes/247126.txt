Ingredients:
3 cups chopped garlic scapes
1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
1 cup flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 (16 ounce) box fettuccine pasta
1 pound cooked shrimp
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Place garlic scapes, Romano cheese, parsley, and walnuts in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to combine. Scrape down sides. Turn on food processor; pour in olive oil and lemon juice while processing pesto until smooth.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta, bring back to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Stir pesto and shrimp into the pasta. Season with salt and black pepper. Squeeze a lemon wedge over pasta and serve remaining wedges alongside.
