Ingredients:
5 #  Ground Chuck
3 pkg Taco Seasoning
1 pkg Spicy Chili seasoning
1 10oz can diced tomatoes w/green chiles
1 medium onion, chopped finely
6 medium fresh jalapeno peppers, chopped
1 1# bag of salad greens (your choice, I use iceberg mix)
1-2 8 oz bags of finely shredded cheese, pref taco blend
1 8 oz tub sour cream
1 16 oz bag restaurant style tortilla chips

Directions:
Brown ground chuck, drain, reserve liquid
Add seasoning packets to meat, adding back liquid (or water, if you prefer) as needed to maintain moist consistency.
Make all other ingredients individually available and serve buffet style.
This is infinitely flexible as you can add or remove ingredients to suit the tastes of your family.
Some suggested additions:
Salsa
Guacamole
Ranch or Thousand Island dressing
green or black olives, sliced
kidney chili beans
fresh, sliced mushrooms
tomato wedges
If you can put it on a salad, it'll pretty much go with this
