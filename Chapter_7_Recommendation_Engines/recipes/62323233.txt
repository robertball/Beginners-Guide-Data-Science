Ingredients:
1 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
Heat your skillet on a medium heat and add the almonds and sugar.  Stir constantly for the next 5-10 minutes.  The sugar will melt and the almonds will begin to toast in the pan.  As the sugar melts it will coat the almonds.
When the sugar and the almonds turn golden to light brown, you are done.
Pour the mixture out onto waxed paper, parchment paper, or aluminum foil and allow to cool.
Store in an airtight container and use to top your favorite salad!
