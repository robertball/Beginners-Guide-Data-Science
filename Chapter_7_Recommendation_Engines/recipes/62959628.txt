Ingredients:
2 cups of boneless chicken breasts, cooked, cubed or cut into bite size pieces
1 bunch of broccoli florets, blanched
1 8oz. package of white button mushrooms
2 cans (10.75 ounce) Campbell’s condensed Cream of Chicken soup
1 cup of regular sour cream
1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese (i.e., Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese), plus 1T reserved for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degree C)
Cut chicken into cubes or into bite size pieces. Set aside.
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add broccoli crowns, cover with a lid, turn off stove and let it sit for 1 minute. Place broccoli in ice cold water, set aside.
In a 9x13 inch baking pan, layer the broccoli crowns. Place chicken on top of broccoli then the mushrooms. Mix the soup with sour cream and mozzarella cheese, pour over the layers. Mix well. Sprinkle the reserved 1T cheese over the top.
Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until heated through, bubbly and cheese is melted. Serve with hot rice.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my Auntie. Tender moist chicken, broccoli, mushrooms and mozzarella baked in a creamy chicken soup and topped with more cheese make a delicious all-in-one meal! I always serve this over cooked white rice. This is even better with “Cheddar Casserole Bread,” by Marillyn Miller on this website.
