Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon table salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon coarse salt
48 caramel Hershey's kisses

Directions:
Beat butter until creamy. Gradually beat in white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, cocoa, and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Gradually add to butter mixture, beating well. Cover and chill 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Press a small ball of dough around a caramel kiss. Roll into a ball. Dip the tops into the sugar mixture. Place sugar side up, 2 inches apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Sprinkle coarse salt over each cookie.
Bake for 8 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
