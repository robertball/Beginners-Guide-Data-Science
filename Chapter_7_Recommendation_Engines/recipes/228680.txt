Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1 onion, chopped
1 bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.
Cook and stir ground beef, sausage, onion, and bell pepper together in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef and sausage are completely browned and crumbled, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain grease from skillet and return to heat.
Stir flour, salt, oregano, and black pepper into the beef mixture. Pour spaghetti sauce over the mixture. Add mixed vegetables; bring mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish.
Roll crescent dough into a flat layer atop the beef mixture; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until the dough is golden and the cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
