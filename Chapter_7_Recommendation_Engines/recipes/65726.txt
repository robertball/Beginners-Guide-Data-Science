Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) fresh or thawed duckling, cut up
1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Baste & Glaze
1/4 cup orange marmalade
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Trim off excess fat from duckling pieces. Rinse pieces; drain and pat dry. Score skin with diagonal slashes 1 inch apart. Place pieces, skin side up, on rack in shallow, foil-lined baking pan.
Bake in 350 degrees F oven 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine teriyaki baste & glaze, marmalade, sherry and pepper; remove and reserve 1/4 cup glaze mixture.
Drain off pan drippings. Turn oven temperature to broil and raise oven rack 5 to 7 inches from heat. Brush duckling pieces thoroughly with remaining glaze mixture. Broil, skin side down, 5 minutes. Turn pieces over; brush again with glaze mixture. Broil 5 minutes longer, or until skin is crisp. Blend reserved glaze mixture with water in small saucepan; bring to boil. Serve duckling pieces with warm sauce.
