Ingredients:
For Crust:
1 ¼ cup flour
¼ cup sugar
½ cup butter
2 tbsp water
For Filling:
4 oz milk chocolate
8 oz cream cheese
1 egg
½ cup sugar
1 tbsp flour
1 tsp vanilla
For Topping:
2-3 cups fresh (or frozen) mixed berries such as blue, rasp, black, straw
2 tbsp raspberry syrup (or jam heated until viscous)
2 tsp blackberry or raspberry liqueur

Directions:
Blend first three ingredients in food processor until crumbly.  Add water and mix until dough holds together.  Press dough into bottom and up sides of 9” tart pan.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.  Poke holes in dough with fork to eliminate air bubbles.
Increase oven temperature to 375.
Melt chocolate and spread over baked crust.  Beat remaining ingredients until smooth, and spread over chocolate layer.
Place berries tightly and evenly over cream cheese filling.  Stir together remaining two ingredients and brush over berries.  Bake at 375 for 35 minutes.  Filling will set as it cools.
