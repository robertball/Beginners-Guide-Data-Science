Description: 
This recipe is similar to the sauce used in a famous ribs restaurant in Cincinnati.  It is sweet/tart/spicy. It keeps 6 months in the fridge, 2 weeks on the shelf or 1 year in the freezer (though it may not completely solidify).  It's great on ribs, pulled pork and chicken. Excellent with California Cole Slaw.
