1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (16 ounce) can mashed sweet potatoes or unsweetened sweet potatoes, rinsed, drained and mashed
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels

PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease and flour one 13 x9-inch or two 9-inch-round baking pans.

Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add oil; beat until well blended. Stir in morsels, pecans and water. Stir in flour mixture; mix until blended. Pour into prepared pan(s).
BAKE for 35 to 40 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely in pan(s) on wire rack(s). For layer cakes, remove from pans after 10 minutes. Frost with Creamy Premier White Icing.
