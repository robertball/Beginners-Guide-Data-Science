Ingredients:
2  boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
½ (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 medium carrots, sliced
1  onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons mild curry paste
1 tablespoon finely ground almonds
1 small bunch chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
¼ cup sliced almonds
1 ½ cups uncooked white rice

Directions:
Combine chicken, tomatoes, coconut milk, carrots, onion, garlic, curry paste, ground almonds, and 4/5 of the cilantro in the slow cooker and close the lid.
Cook on High until chicken is cooked through, about 4 hours. If sauce is too thin, mix cornstarch with water in a small bowl and stir into the sauce. Cook for an additional 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring 3 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Serve curry over rice, sprinkled with remaining cilantro and sliced almonds.
