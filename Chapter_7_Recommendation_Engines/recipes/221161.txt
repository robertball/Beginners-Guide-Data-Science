Ingredients:
cooking spray
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups apple juice
2  lemons, juiced
4 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules

Directions:
Heat skillet sprayed with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in the skillet until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Cut chicken into strips.
Whisk apple juice, lemon juice, cornstarch, and chicken bouillon in a skillet until smooth.
Heat skillet over medium heat, stirring until sauce is thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes; continue cooking for 3 more minutes.
Place chicken strips into the apple juice sauce and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I've been making this recipe for over 10 years; my family requests it all the time. Great flavor and relatively easy/quick. I serve this with Wild Rice and Zucchini (cooked in olive oil with some garlic salt).  Enjoy!
