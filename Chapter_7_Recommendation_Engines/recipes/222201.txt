Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley
2 (29 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 cups dry white wine
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed chicken broth
2 teaspoons dried thyme
3 pounds cod fillets, cut into 2-inch chunks

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large soup pot; stir in onion, garlic, and parsley. Cook and stir until onion is softened, about 8 minutes; pour in tomato sauce, white wine, chicken broth, and thyme. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes; gently stir in cod and simmer until fish is cooked through and flaky, another 10 to 15 minutes.
