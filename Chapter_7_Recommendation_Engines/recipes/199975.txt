Bring a pot with salted water to a rolling boil; add the edamame and cook 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.

Description: 
Super easy recipe. This is great on crackers, but is even better as a sandwich filling on a toasted whole wheat pita with a slice of Muenster.
