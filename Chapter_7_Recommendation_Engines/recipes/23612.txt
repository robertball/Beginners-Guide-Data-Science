Description: 
This is my family's favorite recipe! Please experiment with the ingredient amounts. Maybe you will want yours extra cheesy! I have used instant potatoes but no comparison to them roasted. Well worth the effort and a wonderful comfort food.  Serve with bread and salad-the perfect meal!
