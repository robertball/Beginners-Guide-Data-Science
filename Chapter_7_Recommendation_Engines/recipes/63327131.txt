Ingredients:
1 large block velveeta cheese
1/2 lb hot ground sausage
1/2 lb ground beef
1 onion, diced
1 large can (28oz) rotel
1 can cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
brown the ground beef, sausage, and diced onion together.
Drain this, then put in the bottom of crock pot.
Cube the velveeta block and put this on top of the meat mixture.
I always like to blend the rotel up, so that the rotel comes out creamier and less chunky, but that is a personal preference. Add the rotel in the crock pot blended or not blended.
Then just add in the can of cream of mushroom. 6. Stir together and continue to stir every once in a while.
