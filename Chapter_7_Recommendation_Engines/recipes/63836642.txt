Ingredients:
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup cold water
2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening and butter into flour, add 1 tablespoon water to mixture at a time. Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together. You should still be able to see flecks of butter and shortening. This will keep the crust flaky, if you can't visually see butter or shortening don't worry! The crust will come out fine just remember to cut the butter/shortening/ dough mix less the next time.
With lightly floured hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside down 8 to 9 inch pie pan.   Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right side up on to the pie pan. Unroll, ease dough into the bottom of the pie pan.
In a large bowl with mixer speed on medium, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt. Mix well. Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean.
