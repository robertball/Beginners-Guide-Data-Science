Ingredients:
1/2 (15 oz.) package refrigerated piecrusts
1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (15 oz.) can pumpkin
2 cups whipping cream, divided
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
2 egg yolks, lightly beaten
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
3 tbsp. water
3 tbsp. corn syrup
1/3 cup sugar
chopped pecans for garnish

Directions:
First piecrust into a 9-inch pieplate according to package directions; fold edges under and crimp.
Cook condensed milk in a medium-sized heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, 10 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat, stir in pumpkin.
Stir in 1 cup cream and next 4 ingredients until smooth. Pour into crust. Bake at 350 degrees on bottom oven rack for 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Chill 8 hours.
Cook 3 tbsp. water, syrup and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 300 degrees (hard-crack stage). Pour immediately over pie, and quickly spread with a metal spatula. Let stand 2 hours before serving.
Tap hard sugar topping with back of a spoon to crack. Beat remaining cream at medium speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Serve over pie, garnishing with chopped pecans, if desired.

Description: 
This is from Southern Living magazine, circa 1999. My family often vacations during Thanksgiving, so we usually have someone else cook for us, but his year we're at home and this amazing pie is on the menu. I'm not into making crust, so refrigerated works well.
