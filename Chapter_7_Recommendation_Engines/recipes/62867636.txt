1/2 cup milk

1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon of salt
1 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or electric skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine the green beans and water in a saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Cook until the beans are bright green, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Cover with cold water and set aside.
In one bowl, whisk the egg and milk together. In a separate bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, chili powder, garlic powder, salt and onion powder.
Drain the green beans and toss with flour to coat, shaking off the excess. Dip the beans into the egg mixture and then into the bread crumbs, coating thoroughly.
move on to cook the beans or at this point Put the beans in the fridge for 10-20 mins. this step will normally render breading that stays on the green beans better.
Fry beans in batches so they are not touching. Cook until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
