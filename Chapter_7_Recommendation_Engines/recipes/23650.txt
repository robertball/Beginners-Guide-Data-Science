Description: 
This is for all the people who don't like pumpkin pie. I don't like pumpkin pie either, but this one's different. It's so spicy!! It has become a much anticipated family custom. It's best to make your own pie shell instead of using the ready made kind because they aren't deep enough. This recipe is easily doubled.
