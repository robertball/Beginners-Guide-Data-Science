Ingredients:
1 to 1.5 lbs beef roast (lean-ish and cubed)
1 tablespoon of fresh garlic (minced)
½ medium Spanish or yellow onion (diced)
3 tablespoons of vegetable oil
2 tablespoons of flour
1 teaspoon of garlic powder
1 teaspoon of onion powder
½ teaspoon of Grandma’s Chili (if you don’t have this, substitute with red chili powder.  A little goes a long way  you just want to give the meat a little bite…we’re going for flavor, not heat.
½ teaspoon comino (aka cumin)
2 medium/large russet potatoes (cubed)
4 cups of water
2 tablespoons of Wyler's beef granules or Better Than Bouillon Beef Base
1 (15oz) can of Hunt’s tomato sauce
Tortillas (optional)
Sour cream (optional)
Shredded Mexican cheese (optional)

Directions:
Trim excess fat from roast and cut into ½ inch cubes.
In a large Ziploc bag add the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin and chile powder and mix.
Add the beef to the bag and shake until the meat is evenly coated.
In a dutch oven or large, deep frying pan, heat oil and then add minced garlic and onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes on medium heat.
Add beef to pan and brown until coating and beef are seared a golden brown.
Add 4 cups hot water and beef granules.  Bring to a boil and then turn heat down to medium-low (or lower depending on your stove) and cover. Cook for approx. 1.5 to 2 hours or until meat cuts easily with a spoon. (You want the meat to simmer very slowly to get tender but not fall apart.)
Towards the end of the time, watch the beef carefully.  It may begin to stick to the bottom of the pan or the liquid may reduce too much. Just stir regularly. You want the meat to still be about 1/2 covered with the thickening liquid.
Peel potatoes and cut in 1/4 inch thick quarters.  Add potatoes and tomato sauce to the beef. Stir until mixed and cook undisturbed for another 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are just cooked (not mushy).
Turn off heat and let meat set for about 15 minutes so that the sauce can thicken. (The sauce may look too runny at first, but the 15 minute wait really does help since you have the flour and the starch from the potatoes.)
Serve in heated tortillas as a burrito by itself or with the optional cheese or sour cream (they taste great as-is though).  You can also serve as a side dish with refried beans if you want to forego the tortillas.

Description: 
This recipe was passed down from my grandmother. It may take a while to cook, but it is well-worth it. For our family, these are traditionally made when we go on camping or fishing trips or at family gatherings.  My mom would cook these around 4a.m. in the morning, have them ready by 6a.m. and make lots of burritos wrapped in foil and keep them in a insulated food box so we could munch on them while we were out sea-fishing for the day and they kept us full and warm! We would have so many, we always shared and our fellow fishermen/women always wanted the recipe.
