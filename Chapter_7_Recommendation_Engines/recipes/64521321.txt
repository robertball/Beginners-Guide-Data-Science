Ingredients:
12 oz (340 g) boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/4 tsp each salt and pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
12 oz (340 g) cremini mushrooms, sliced
4 sprigs fresh thyme
1 cup sodium-reduced chicken broth
1/3 cup whipping cream (35%)
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tsp Dijon mustard
12 oz (340 g) whole wheat spaghetti
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Coarsely ground pepper (optional)

Directions:
Sprinkle chicken with half each of the salt and pepper.
In large skillet, heat half of the oil over medium-high heat; cook chicken, turning once, until no longer pink inside, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to cutting board; slice thinly across the grain.
Add remaining oil to pan; reduce heat to medium. Cook mushrooms, thyme and remaining salt and pepper until mushrooms are tender and golden, about 8 minutes.
Stir in broth; bring to boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Stir in cream, parsley and mustard; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Discard thyme.
Meanwhile, in large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid, drain.
Return pasta to pot. Add sauce and chicken; toss, adding as much of the reserved cooking liquid as needed to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and pepper (if using).
