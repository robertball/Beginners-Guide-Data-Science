Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package kluski (egg) noodles
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups milk
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups sauerkraut, drained
1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, cubed
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook kluski noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Whisk in flour, dry mustard, and black pepper; cook until smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in milk, a little at a time, and bring white sauce to a boil. Cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly, to make a smooth, thick sauce. Whisk 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese into sauce until melted.
Stir kluski noodles, sauerkraut, and kielbasa sausage into the sauce and transfer to a 3-quart casserole dish. Mix bread crumbs with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl and sprinkle over the casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is heated through, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
A true German/Polish dish that is simply 'Delish'! I sometimes use Swiss cheese in place of the Cheddar, which is a good switch as well! This is a casserole that is very inexpensive, simple and quick to make - and not to mention leftovers are the best the next day as well!!
