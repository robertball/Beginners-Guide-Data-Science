Ingredients:
12 oz Wheat Rotini Pasta
1 tsp salt
1/2 cup red bell pepper, finely diced
1/2 cup green bell pepper, finely diced
1 small cucumber, finely diced
1 stalk white celery,finely diced
4 green onions, finely diced
1 carrot, finely diced
2 tbsp pickled banana peppers(in a jar),finely diced
2 tbsp green olives, finely diced
3 tbsp black olives, finely diced
1/2 cup cheddar cheese, finely cubed
1/2 cup turkey lunchmeat, cut into 1/2" strips
1/4 cup parmesan cheese, finely grated
Dressing:
1 cup mayo
1/3 cup milk
1 tbsp dried minced onion
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp dried thyme
1/4 tsp celery seed
1/4 tsp dried mustard

Directions:
Heat a large pot of water over high heat and add a good amount of salt.
Cook the pasta per package directions, I prefer to cook my pasta just past al dente.
Meanwhile start finely dicing up all those veggies.
Drain the pasta using a quick rinse of cool water to stop the cooking process. Set aside to cool for a few minutes then pour the pasta into a large bowl to begin mixing everything together.
On top of the mostly cooled pasta start adding the ingredients in the order listed. Fold together gently.
In a glass jar add the the ingredients for the 'Dressing'.  Shake to combine, then pour over the salad, again folding gently to thoroughly incorporate the dressing with all the ingredients.
Cover and refrigerate.
