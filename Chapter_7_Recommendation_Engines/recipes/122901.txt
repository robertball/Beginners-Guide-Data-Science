1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup, undiluted

1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup crushed butter-flavored crackers
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine broccoli, soup, 1 cup cheese, onion, Worcestershire sauce and pepper. Pour into a 3-qt. greased slow cooker. Sprinkle crackers on top; dot with butter. Cover and cook on high for 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cook 10 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.

Description: 
This casserole is quick to assemble and full of good flavor. Even those who don't usually like broccoli enjoy it served this way. Since it simmers in a slow cooker, it frees up my oven for other things when I'm preparing a big meal.
