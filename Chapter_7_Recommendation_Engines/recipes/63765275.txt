Ingredients:
Rachel Ray talked about how you should make your own taco seasoning because the stuff you buy in stores is full of sodium, preservatives, etc. This is just full of flavor. Simply spices! 1 T chili powder, 1 T ground cumin, 1 T garlic powder, 1 T onion powder, 1/4–½ T crushed red pepper
