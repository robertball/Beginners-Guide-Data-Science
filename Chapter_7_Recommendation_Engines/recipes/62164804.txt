Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package orange cake mix OR
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix and 2 teaspoons     orange extract
1 packet dry Dream Whip mix
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup cold milk
4 Tablespoons Triple Sec or other orange flavoring
1 (8 ounce) tub of whipped topping, thawed
Mandarin orange sections, well-drained and blotted dry.

Directions:
Prepare the cake according to package directions adding the dry Dream Whip mix.  If you are using a yellow cake, add orange coloring to the batter for better presentation. I used Wilton gel.
Bake, according to the package directions in a 10x14 pan or two 9x13 pans to have thinner layers.
Cool completely in the pan and turn out on waxed paper.
Meanwhile, make the topping by mixing the pudding, milk, liquor and whipped topping and chill thoroughly.
Press and twist the bottom of a 1.5 oz. shooter cup to make a slight indentation on the bottom of the cake.  Use a sharp knife to cut out the "tube" of cake.  Place the cake in the shooter glasses or cups.
Place the topping in a ziplock bag and cut a tiny tip off of one corner.  Gently squeeze the topping onto the cake in the shooter glasses.
Cut a small slit in the edge of the orange sections and hang on the side of the glass.
