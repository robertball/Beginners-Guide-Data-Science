Salty Bones Recipe

Ingredients:
1 tube of refrigerated breadstick dough (we used an 11-ounce tube to make 12 bones)
Coarse salt

Directions:
Unroll a tube of refrigerated breadstick dough and separate the rectangular pieces.
Working with one piece at a time, stretch the dough to lengthen it a bit and then use kitchen scissors or a knife to cut a 11/2-inch slit in the center of each end.
Roll or shape the resulting four flaps of dough into knobs that look like the ends of a bone.
Place the dough bones on an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a few inches apart, and sprinkle on a little coarse salt. Bake the bones until they are light golden brown, about 12 minutes.

It wouldn't be Halloween without a skeleton -- in this case, one that's been reassembled into a pile of tasty bones to pick.
