Ingredients:
8-10 large chicken legs
1 cup honey
1 cup orange juice with pulp
1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature
1 package or 7-8 sprigs  FRESH rosemary finely chopped
2 large navel oranges zested
2 cloves garlic minced (optional)
1 tablespoon salt
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
Rinse and pat dry chicken. Season with salt and place in large non-metal bowl.
In medium bowl whisk together in order honey, orange juice, butter, chopped rosemary, orange zest and garlic. Pour mixture over chicken and cover securely.  Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours.
Evenly place chicken in metal roasting pan and pour orange mixture over chicken. Roast at 350 for a half hour then reduce heat to 325 degrees. Baste chicken using gravy ladle every 20 minutes for an hour and a half or until chicken is a deep orange brown colour.
Serve this dish with a fragrant rice side and dilled carrots or roasted asparagus
Note: A lot of the orange glaze remains in the pan. I usually mix it into the rice or it can be strained and thickened with a bit of cornstarch and poured OVER the rice

Description: 
This is always a hit when I make it for dinner parties and Boxing Day dinner because the chicken is always fall off the bone juicy and people love the glaze. People always go for seconds!  

You may quarter 2 chickens instead if you arenâ€™t able to get just legs from your butcher, but I find the legs are juicier and saves money.
