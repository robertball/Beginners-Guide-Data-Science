Ingredients:
Yumbo Gumbo
•	6 large garlic cloves, minced
•	1 large yellow onion, chopped
•	6 stalks of celery, chopped
•	3 green bell peppers, chopped
•	1 bunch of green onions, chopped
•	1 cup vegetable oil
•	1 cup all purpose flour
•	1 large can diced tomatoes
•	1 lb cleaned, peeled, and deveined shrimp
•	1 lb package of smoked sausage, chopped in half-inch slices
•	4 cups shredded chicken
•	2 T salt
•	1 T  ground black pepper
•	 cayenne pepper to taste
•	3 bay leaves
•	1lb  frozen chopped okra, thawed
•	4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Mix the flour and oil in a pot over medium high heat to make a roux, stirring constantly until it is a rich brown color.  Be careful not to rush this step, making sure not to let it burn.      Add in the vegetables, sausage, and broth.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and let cook for 15-20 minutes.  Just before serving, add the shredded chicken and shrimp. Adjust your seasoning and continue cooking until the shrimp is just pink and the chicken is heated through.  Serve over  rice.
****especially good the next  day, so if you have the time (and restraint), let gumbo come to room temperature and refrigerate overnight.  Reheat in a pot on low until it is heated through and enjoy!
