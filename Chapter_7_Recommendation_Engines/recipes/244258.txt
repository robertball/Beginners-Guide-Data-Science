Ingredients:
1 cup raisins (optional)
3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
2/3 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons corn syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/3 cups old-fashioned oats
2/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x11-inch baking dish.
Stir raisins, 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons applesauce, chocolate-hazelnut spread, brown sugar, honey, corn syrup, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine oats and flour together in a resealable plastic bag, shake until mixed. Stir oat mixture into chocolate-hazelnut mixture; spread granola into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before cutting into bars, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This recipe is actually based off a recipe called Chewy, Nutty, Healthy Granola Bars that I modified. I made for my 4-H club and they loved it so much I made it a couple more times. The raisins are just a filler because I felt the granola bars were lacking without it. The granola bars still taste good without it. Dried fruit or nuts can be substituted.
