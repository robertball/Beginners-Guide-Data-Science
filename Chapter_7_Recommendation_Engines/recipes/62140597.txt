Description: 
OK, now when I am transforming a meat dish into vegetarian, there are certain shortcuts I know: I can use quorn or TVP for chicken, and vegetable stock for chicken stock. And, I can use organic mushrooms in place of stewing beef.  But... for a long time, I didn't have a replacement for beef stock. Sure, I could use vegetable stock, but it wasn't earthy enough, it was too light.  So, I invented the stock below for a rich earthy stock for vegan use!
