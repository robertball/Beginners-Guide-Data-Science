Description: 
I got this recipe from my brother-in-law's uncle, and I absolutely love it! A different BBQ sauce that is different than the usual. You must try this! This is a recipe that is open to changes of the amount of each ingredient until it's to your liking. Use as a dip or pour over your meat of choice. It goes wonderful with chicken!
