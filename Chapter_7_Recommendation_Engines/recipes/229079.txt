Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 large onions, coarsely chopped
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 1/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/4 cups vegetable broth
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound fresh spinach, chopped and stems removed

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onions and cauliflower until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper; stir to coat.
Stir tomatoes and vegetable broth into cauliflower mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Bring mixture to a boil, cover, and reduce heat. Simmer until flavors have blended, about 8 minutes. Stir spinach into mixture until it begins to wilt. Cover and simmer until spinach is completely wilted and cauliflower is tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
