Ingredients:
16 oz mushrooms, sliced (I used baby bellas)
2 stalks celery, diced
1 medium onion, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 c Panko breadcrumbs
1/4 c Parmesan cheese
1 c reduced fat mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 egg whites
1 tbsp light butter
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried sage (substituted rosemary)
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees and spray  casserole dish with an olive oil spray. In a medium, nonstick skillet melt 1 tbsp butter over medium high heat. Add in onions and celery, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add in mushrooms, garlic, thyme, sage and salt and pepper, and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 4 minutes.
Transfer mushroom mixture to a large bowl, and stir in all remaining ingredients, except for the shredded mozzarella. Pour into prepared casserole dish and top evenly with the shredded mozzarella.
Place into oven and bake until cheese becomes golden and bubbly, about 10-15 minutes. Of course, I broiled mine for a couple minutes too!
