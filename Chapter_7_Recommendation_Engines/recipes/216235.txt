2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained
1 cup PaceÂ® Picante Sauce
1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs

2 tablespoons lime juice
1/4 cup light mayonnaise
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Thoroughly mix the crabmeat, 1/4 cup picante sauce, bread crumbs, egg and lime juice in a medium bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Shape the crabmeat mixture into 14 (1 1/2-inch) crab cakes. Stir the remaining picante sauce and the mayonnaise in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the crab cakes in batches and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Drain the crab cakes on paper towels. Serve with the picante-mayonnaise mixture.
