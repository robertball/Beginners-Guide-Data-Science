Ingredients:
2 lemons, thinly sliced
1 apple, cored and sliced (any kind)
1 cup strawberries, hulled and sliced lengthwise
1 750 ml bottle white wine (a dry-ish white wine is best  I like Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay)
1/2 cup white rum
4 cups lemon-lime soda

Directions:
Add lemon slices to a large pitcher, then the apples, then the strawberries.
Pour the wine and rum over the top.
Cover and place in the refrigerator for 4 – 5 hours.
Remove from refrigerator and add the lemon lime soda. Add a few pieces of the fruit to your glass and pour sangria over to serve.
