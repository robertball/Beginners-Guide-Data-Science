2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

1 pkg provolone cheese slices to line bottom of boats

Directions:
cut zucchini in half lengthwise; using a melon baller, start about 1/2 inch from end and scoop out the middle of the zucchini but not to much. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place zucchini face down and bake @ 350 degrees for 15 minutes then line the boats with provolone cheese. 1 slice per boat (cut cheese in half, this fits perfectly in boat)
cook 1 cup rice; set aside. Brown ground chicken; now add rice to chicken and set aside.
In a medium Teflon pan saute onion, jalapeno peppers and some chopped zucchini (from what you scooped out) in olive oil for about 5 min then add garlic, basil, oregano and worcestershire stir well then add to meat and rice mixture. Now add tomato sauce, parmesan cheese and salt & pepper to taste.
Stuff the boats w/ the mixture and top with a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese and return to 350 degree oven and bake an additional 25 to 30 minutes - ENJOY!!!
