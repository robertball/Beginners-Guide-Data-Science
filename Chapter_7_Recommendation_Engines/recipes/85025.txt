Steam sugar snap peas in a separate pan about 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender.

Description: 
This dish gets its flavor from both the leaves and seeds of the coriander plant.  Ground coriander seasons the chicken while coriander leaves, better known as cilantro leaves in the United States, accent the creamy sauce.
