Ingredients:
2 Heads of garlic (not cloves, heads)
1 lb. angel hair pasta
2 cups olive oil
freshly grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Peel and dice garlic into tiny cubes.  Heat water for pasta.  Heat olive oil and test it by putting in one cube of garlic.  If it 'fizzes'and starts to cook, gently put the rest of the garlic in, stirring consantly.  Once garlic looks like it is starting to brown, use a slotted spoon and remove from oil.
As soon as pasta is cooked, put a serving onto a plate, top with a spooful of fried garlic, a ladel full of the olive oil, and parmesan cheese to taste.
Serve with salad, and bread (to absorb the wonderful garlic oil left on your plate!!)

Description: 
Tiny pieces of garlic fried in olive oil and served over pasta, then topped with parmesan cheese.For garlic lovers!!  Don't be scared off by the amount of garlic used...it carmelizes and sweetens as it fries in olive oil.  Not offensive at all.  It has become a favorite in my family, including my kids.
