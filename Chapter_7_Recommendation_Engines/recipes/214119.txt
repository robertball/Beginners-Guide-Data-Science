Ingredients:
1 large eggplant, cut lengthwise into 6 1/4-inch slices
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon coriander seed, coarsely cracked
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Brush both sides of each eggplant slice generously with olive oil; arrange in a single layer in the bottom of a broiler pan. Scatter about half of the cracked coriander seed over the eggplant slices.
Cook under the broiler until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and season with the remaining coriander seed; cook under the broiler until browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Whisk the lemon juice, basil, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle over the broiled eggplant slices. Serve warm.

Description: 
Eggplant without garlic? Yes, it can work - deliciously. This recipe seems to me to bring out the glorious flavor of eggplant and is wonderful for a change to other garlicky eggplant recipes. It is important not to pulverize the coriander.
