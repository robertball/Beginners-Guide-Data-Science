Ingredients:
2 packages(boxes) frozen chopped broccoli,thawed and drained or do what I do and cook a couple pounds broccoli lightly steamed chopped and proceed:
3 eggs
I cup flour
1 cup milk
I tsp baking powder
1 Pound SHARP Cheddar cheese, no skimping!   Grated.
1 tsp salt
Grated pepper
1/4 cup butter
OPTIONAL!   1 pound italian sausage sauteed OR 1 pound mushrooms sauteed with onions.
If you wish add chopped onions and a bit of Italian sausage  that has been sauteed, (I also love a bunch of 'shrooms)!
Usually I add onion and mushrooms but for meat-eaters the sausage is good too...

Directions:
Take butter (about 1/4 cup)and put into baking pan  (9x13) and into 350 oven, let it melt.
Mix above ingredients, Pour on top of the melted butter and pop in oven at 350 until it gets golden brown on top.   About 1/2 hour 45 minutes or so....   (closer to 45 minutes)
Eat lukewarm for best flavor or warm. NOT hot or cold.

Description: 
So incredibly good you will not believe how easy they are to make.  A Family secret recipe that leaves lots of room for interpretation.   We eat these a lot in the summer for Dinner with a Salad and a loaf of good bread.
