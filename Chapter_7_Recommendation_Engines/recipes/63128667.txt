Ingredients:
4 bone-in pork chops (either center or end cut is fine, but at least 1 inch thick)
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
¾ cup chicken broth
2/3 cup tawny Port
2 tablespoons dijon mustard

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
Generously sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper.  Coat the pork chops with the flour.  In a skillet heat the olive oil and the butter together until the butter is melted and sizzling.  Add the pork chops and cook until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork chops to an oven-safe casserole dish.
Add the broth, Port and mustard to the skillet.  Bring the mixture to a boil while scraping the browned bits from the bottom and gently boil for 3 minutes.  Taste the sauce for salt and pepper, correct the seasoning if necessary and then pour the sauce over the pork chops.
Bake the pork chops until extremely tender when pierced with a fork—for about an hour.  Serve with some of the sauce spooned over the top.
