Ingredients:
3 tablespoons light margarine
4 onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground dried thyme
6 large baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, or to taste
salt and cracked black pepper to taste
1/4 cup softened light margarine
3/4 cup fat free half-and-half

Directions:
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened, and achieved a deep brown color, 15 to 25 minutes. Stir in vinegar and thyme, and cook for 5 minutes more.
While the onions are cooking, place cubed potatoes in large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander, and allow to steam for a minute.
To finish the dish, transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl, and use a potato masher to mix with Dijon mustard, horseradish, salt and cracked black pepper until smooth. Mix in softened butter, caramelized onions, and half-and-half until onions are distributed evenly.

Description: 
Caramelized onions give this incredible side dish a subtle sweetness, and the addition of horseradish gives it a little attitude! They make an absolutely fabulous side dish to prime rib, and have become a tradition every year at family holiday gatherings! To save time, the caramelized onions can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, then warmed before adding to the potatoes.Modified from: Caramelized Onion and Horseradish Smashed Potatoes
