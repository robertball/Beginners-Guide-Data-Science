Ingredients:
2 tablespoons of pumpkin purée
2 tablespoons of cream cheese
2 whole wheat tortillas
couple sprinkles of cinnamon
a few drizzles of honey
a dollop of olive oil

Directions:
Make up some pumpkin purée however you like. I personally always keep a bag of frozen cut-up pumpkin in the freezer and then sautée and fork-mash those puppies up.
Spread the pumpkin on one tortilla and the cream cheese on the other.
Sprinkle some cinnamon and drizzle with honey to taste.
Seal the 2 tortillas together, drizzle a little olive oil in a pan and pan-fry on medium heat for 3 minutes on each side.
Cut the tortilla up in triangles and serve.
