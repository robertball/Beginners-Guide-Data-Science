Description: 
Creamy soup with mild spice and a zip of citrus. It is inspired by Tom Kha Gai from Laotian and Thai cuisines, but it whips together quickly from ingredients that are easily and routinely availableÂ—real Tom Kha needs fresh lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal root that are not always available in my locale.
