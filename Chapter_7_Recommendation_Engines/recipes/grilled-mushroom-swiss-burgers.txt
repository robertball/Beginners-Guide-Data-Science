Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 teaspoon seasoned meat tenderizer
salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons butter
2 (4 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained
2 tablespoons soy sauce
4 slices Swiss cheese
6 hamburger buns

Directions:
Prepare a grill for medium heat. Lightly oil the grate.
Divide the ground beef into 6 patties. Season with meat tenderizer, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and soy sauce; cook and stir until browned. Set aside and keep warm.
Grill the patties for about 6 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Divide the mushroom mixture evenly amongst the burgers and top each one with a slice of Swiss cheese. Cover the grill for about 1 minute to allow the cheese to melt. Remove from the grill and serve on hamburger buns.

Description: 
This is a great way to spice up an ordinary hamburger.  Not only can this be done on the grill, but pan fried if desired.  Too good not to try!!
