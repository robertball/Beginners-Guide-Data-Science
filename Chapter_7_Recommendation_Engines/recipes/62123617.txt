Ingredients:
1/3 cup Splenda (you can use sugar if you want)
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard
2 teaspoons grated onion
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup grapeseed oil
1 tablespoon poppy seeds

Directions:
In food processor, blend everything except oils and poppyseeds.  Blend for about 15 seconds.  Drizzle in the oils in a steady stream as the processor is running.  Stir in the poppyseeds by hand.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours to allow flavors to combine.  (You can serve it immediately, but it's better if you wait.)
This is particularly good tossed with Wasabi Secret Salad.

Description: 
This dressing is similar to the popular grocery store brand, but I substitute Splenda for the sugar so I can have a good, low-carb poppyseed dressing.
