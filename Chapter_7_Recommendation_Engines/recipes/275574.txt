Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1/4 pound bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
9 ounces ground chorizo
1/2 pound frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
1 stalk celery, sliced
1/4 cup water
1 egg
1 teaspoon garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C). Allow to preheat for 2 minutes. Spray a 7-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
Place Tater Tots(R) into the air fryer basket and bake for 15 minutes, shaking basket halfway.
Meanwhile, cook bacon pieces in a small skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Add chorizo and celery slices. Saute for about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Transfer Tater Tots(R) to a bowl and pour bacon-chorizo mixture on top. Mix in water, egg, and garlic base; stir to thoroughly coat. Fill into prepared springform pan.
Reduce temperature of air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Add springform pan to the air fryer and cook for 7 minutes until dressing is cooked through. If dressing doesn't look done, cook an additional 3 minutes.

Description: 
This is a decidedly nontraditional way of making dressing, but packs a lot of flavor with few ingredients! The best part, the portion size is perfect for couples, or the solo diner. You will need a 7-inch springform pan or other air fryer-safe container.
