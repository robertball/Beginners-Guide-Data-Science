Pam Cooking Spray
2 cups shredded hash browns, defrosted
2 Tbsp butter
2 Medium sweet onions, chopped

Description: 
This is a modified recipe partially my own and partially from Barbie Anderson of my Cooking Club group.  It's creamy, flavorful, and not too fattening!  The recipe calls for deli ham, but I used left over ham from Christmas and I think the thicker, diced ham made it taste great.
