Ingredients:
1 (15 oz.) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/3 cup honey or agave nectar
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup molasses
3 Tbsp. worcestershire*
2 tsp. liquid smoke**
1 tsp. smoked paprika
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. freshly-ground black pepper
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. salt
(optional: a few pinches of cayenne powder for extra heat, which I recommend)

Directions:
Whisk all ingredients together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer (uncovered) for 20 minutes, or until the sauce has slightly thickened.
Use the sauce immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 1 week.
