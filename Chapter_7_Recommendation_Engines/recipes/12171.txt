Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, chilled
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/3 cup ice water

Directions:
Combine flour and sugar into the bowl of an electric mixer.  Cut butter into tablespoon pieces; add it to the flour and butter. Use the paddle beater to cut the butter and flour together.  Alternatively, this can be done by hand with a pastry blender.
With the mixer on low speed , or while stirring the mixture with a fork, pour in the cold water.  When the dough starts to clump, and before it turns into a ball, stop stirring.
Lightly knead dough in the bowl until it forms a ball.  Divide dough into two parts.  Flatten each part into a disk, and chill for about 30 minutes before rolling.

Description: 
The very first thing I learned how to cook!   This freezes beautifully; no well-equipped home is without a ball of pie dough in the freezer!  Guaranteed to roll!
