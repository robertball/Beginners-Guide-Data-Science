Ingredients:
Chicken:
8 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Marinade:
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons JIF速 Creamy (or extra crunchy) Peanut Butter
1/4 cup CRISCO速 All-Vegetable Oil
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup fresh lime juice
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
Peanut Sauce:
1 cup JIF速 Creamy (or extra crunchy) Peanut Butter
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Wash, trim and pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness.
Combine chicken and next 8 ingredients in a plastic bag. Marinate 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator.
Combine the JIF(R), coconut milk, lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic and cayenne in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly for about 15 minutes or until thickened. Whisk in the stock and cream. Cook 1 minute more, whisking; set aside.
Preheat grill.  Remove chicken from marinade and place on a hot grill. Grill until browned - about 4 to 6 minutes on each side (or until center is no longer pink) - turning only once.
Serve hot topped with the peanut sauce. Sprinkle with the cilantro.
