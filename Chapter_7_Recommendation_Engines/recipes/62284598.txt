Ingredients:
Marinade:
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon each of:
- ground allspice
- ground cinnamon
- ground black pepper
- paprika
- ground coriander
- salt
Large pinch of ground red pepper
Large pinch of ground cloves
Meat:
1 rack of lamb, Frenched (fat and gristle removed from the bone ends and a light layer of fat remaining on the meat) - best is 7 or 8 ribs

Directions:
Rub the marinade paste all over the rack's meat and marinate in a dish or bowl in the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F).
In a heavy ovenproof skillet, place the rack bone side down (meat side up!) and slide this into the oven.
Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the meat registers 125°F (51°C) for rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium rare.
Remove from the oven and cover loosely with alu foil, and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes.
Carve by cutting down between the ribs and serve.

Description: 
Similar to my Rack of Lamb recipe, but sufficiently different to have a separate entry! Delightful for a hint of Africa as a change to regular lamb racks.
