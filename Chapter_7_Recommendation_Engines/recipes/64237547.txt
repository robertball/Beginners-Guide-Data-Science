Add pork chops and then Add 1/2 cup chicken broth and 2 cans cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 can of chicken broth each.  Cook for 2 hours and then add apples and garlic.  Cook addition 1 hours.
I removed meat and boiled apples to cook them.  I let the gravy and meat sit over night in the refrigerator.  I put on stove 3 hours before we ate.  Was really good.  Need to get thin bone in pork chops from the grocery not Sams.
