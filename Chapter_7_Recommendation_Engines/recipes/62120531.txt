Ingredients:
2 slices sourdough bread
1 oz mozzarella cheese, sliced to cover bread
2 slices ham (optional)
3-4 fresh basil leaves (optional)
1 medium tomato, sliced thick
4 teaspoons butter

Directions:
Butter  one slice of bread and put face down on a plate.  Place sliced of cheese on this slice of bread, basil leaves, then the ham if using. Top with the other slice of bread and butter that side too. (Butter will be on the outsides of the sandwich) Sometimes I sprinkle the outsides with a bit of parmesan cheese.
Heat a medium over medium heat until warm. I prefer my cast iron griddle. Fry the sandwich on both sides until golden brown and cheese is melted.  While the cheese is still melted, open up the sandwich and add in the sliced tomatoes.  Cut the sandwich in half, and serve right away.  This is so yummy, you’ll have one again tomorrow!

Description: 
I came up with this sandwich because of the abundance of fresh tomatoes in my garden.  I usually eat it without the addition of the ham, but that depends on your taste.
