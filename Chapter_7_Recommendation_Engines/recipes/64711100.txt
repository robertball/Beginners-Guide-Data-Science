Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
In a small saucepan, pour the vinegar over the chickpeas and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat. Let sit for 30 mins. Drain. Remove any loose skins.
Preheat air fryer to 390 F. Place chickpeas in basket and spread evenly. Cook for 4 minutes to dry out the chickpeas.
Dump chickpeas into a heat-proof bowl and drizzle with oil and sea salt. Toss to coat.
Return chickpeas to the air fryer and cook for 8 minutes, or until lightly browned,  shaking basket every 2-3 minutes. Serve immediately.
Cook's notes:
The longer the chickpeas sit in the vinegar, the better.
These tend to not keep well. If needed, store in a paper bag or wrapped in parchment paper. If they lose their crisp, reheat them in the air fryer for 1 minute.
