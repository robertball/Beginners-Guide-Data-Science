Description: 
Chocoholic? After eating this rich chocolate pudding you'll question the integrity of box puddings! Use dark, semisweet, or milk chocolate, whatever suits your taste buds! You may want to use a bigger saucepan, I think its easier to mix in. A whisk would beat a spoon by far (no pun intended). If this dish isn't rich enough for you, you could try using chocolate milk, but any milk is fine: skim, 1%, 2%, whole, even soy milk. Same thing with the chocolate; use whatever suits your taste buds: dark, semisweet, or milk chocolate.
