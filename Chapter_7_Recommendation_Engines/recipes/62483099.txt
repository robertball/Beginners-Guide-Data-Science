Description: 
Brisket is rubbed with spices and liquid smoke and then cooked in a slow cooker with barbeque sauce until tender and juicy. This calls for just enough barbecue sauce for that smoky flavor while still allowing the flavor of the meat to come through.Modified from: Busy Day Barbeque Brisket
