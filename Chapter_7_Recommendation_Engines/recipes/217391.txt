Ingredients:
Cake Layer:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons red food coloring
2 tablespoons water
Cheesecake Layer:
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 2/3 cups white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2, 9-inch springform pans with cooking spray.
Sift flour, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder into a large bowl. Whisk in oil, 2 eggs, vanilla extract, vinegar, white sugar, and buttermilk. When well blended, whisk in food coloring and water. Pour half of the batter into each prepared pan.
Bake cakes in preheated oven until cake toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean; about 30 minutes.
While the cake is cooling, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in the sugar and cornstarch; beat until creamy. Add the 2 remaining eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in vanilla. Use a hand whisk to mix in the heavy cream until well blended. Pour half of the batter over each cake layer.
Bake cheesecakes in preheated oven until set and beginning to brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until completely cool, about 1 additional hour.

Description: 
If you love red velvet cake, here is a new spin on it. I love cheesecake and thought that this would be a great combo. This recipe can easily be halved, but if you are having a party is is just as easy to make two as one. Enjoy!
