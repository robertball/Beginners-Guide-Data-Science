Ingredients:
3 lb. chicken (wings or white fryer cut up)
garlic salt (or Lowry's Seasoning)
1-2 eggs, beaten well
2 cups cornstartch
Grease (for frying the chicken)
Sauce:
1 c sugar
1/2 c vinegar
1/4 c water
4 T Ketchup
1 T Soy Sauce (Kikkoman)
1 T HOT Sauce (Frank's Red Hot- original)

Directions:
Sprinkle/Rub chicken with garlic salt/Lowry's
Leave for 1/2 to 1 hour (optional)
Roll chicken in egg, beaten well, then roll in cornstartch until completely covered
Fry in hot fat and drain
(tip: When Frying Chicken; NEVER FLIP or TURN the Chicken until the crust looks 'perfect' .. when the crust looks like it is 'done' then flip/turn to continue frying the chicken.  No matter how tempted you are; don't flip it until it's time!  ...smile)
Place chicken close together in 9x13 pan (line pan with foil for easier cleanup)
Pour sauce over chicken. Then with a spoon continue to poor/drizzle the extra sauce over the chicken. Try to make sure every piece has been covered with sauce.
Bake @ 350 for 40-50 minutes, turning over once during cooking.
(Baste Every 10 Minutes)
*** I was worried that Frying the Chicken, and then Baking it for an hour would Dry out my Chicken; but I didn't Fry my chicken "completely" ... I made sure the crust looked 'perfect' on all sides. But I knew that the chicken was probably pink inside. Then moved it over to the 9x13 ... I made sure the chicken was touching each other to prevent any 'dryness' ... And I basted every 10 minutes! That is the most important step; in my opinion.
*** You can move the chicken to a crockpot, and keep on Warm/Low for 3 - 4 hours! It will be a Favorite, I promise!

Description: 
My Mom Always Served this at our 'Family Picnics'(cold)
but misplaced the recipe for over 40 years.  She recently found it and shared it with me!  Finally!  This was my 'favorite' food as a kid, and have searched every 'recipe' site, but haven't found it!  So, I am posting it here for YOU!  I made this for a 'potluck' thinking I would serve it 'cold' as my childhood memories remember, but it was SOOOO Good 'Hot' that I stuck it in my crockpot to keep it warm throughout the potluck!  Everyone asked for the recipe!  It was a HIT!
