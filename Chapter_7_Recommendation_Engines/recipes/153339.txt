Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 (8 ounce) packages BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix flour, baking soda and salt until well blended; set aside. Beat butter and sugars in large bowl with electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla; beat until well blended. Gradually add flour mixture, mixing well after each addition. Stir in chopped chocolate.
Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough, 2 inches apart, onto baking sheets.
Bake 12 to 13 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on baking sheets 1 minute. Remove to wire racks; cool completely. Serve immediately. (Or, wrap cooled cookies in plastic wrap and place in tightly covered container or resealable plastic bag. Freeze up to 1 month. Thaw at room temperature before serving.)
