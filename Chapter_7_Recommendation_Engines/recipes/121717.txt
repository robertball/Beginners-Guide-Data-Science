1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
Dash pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth, undiluted
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon caraway seeds

In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Crumble beef over the mixture and mix well. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls. In a skillet, brown meatballs; drain. Add broth, mushrooms and onion. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Combine the flour, caraway seeds and sour cream until smooth; stir into meatball mixture.

In a large saucepan, bring water or broth to a rapid boil. Place spaetzle batter in a colander or spaetzle press. Holding over the boiling liquid, press batter through holds of colander.
