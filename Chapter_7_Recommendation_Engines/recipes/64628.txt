Ingredients:
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon shortening
2 cups fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried

Directions:
Melt chocolate in a glass bowl in the microwave, or in a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir frequently until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat, and stir in the shortening until melted.
Line a baking sheet  with waxed paper. Add blueberries to the chocolate, and stir gently to coat. Spoon small clumps of blueberries onto the waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes. Store in a cool place in an airtight container. These will last about 2 days.
