Ingredients:
4 cups sliced peaches
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 tablespoon MINUTE Tapioca
1 dash of nutmeg
1/2 t. of cinnamon
lemon juice or fresh fruit preserver
1/2 t vanilla

Directions:
Place sliced peaches in a bowl with sugar, cornstarch, tapioca, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss until evenly coated and sugar is mostly dissolved.
Transfer peaches to a 9 inch foil-lined pie plate. Cover with another piece of foil and freeze immediately to prevent peaches from discoloring. Once frozen solid, remove peaches from pie plate, with foil, and transfer to a zipper locked plastic bag for later use. When ready to use, line a pie plate with prepared crust and place frozen peaches on top.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack for 20 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking for another 30 to 35 minutes, or until completely warmed through.
