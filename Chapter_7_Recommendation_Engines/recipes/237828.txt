Description: 
Homemade mayo is one of those indescribable culinary pleasures. If you have a stick-style or regular blender you can make your own mayo! It's so much cheaper and way more delicious. You also get to decide what kind of oil you want: a nice fruity olive oil; a lighter vegetable oil; or your own secret custom mix.
