Ingredients:
1/2 cup red lentils
1/2 cup hulled, split pigeon peas (toor dal)
1/2 cup yellow split peas
2 cups water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon mustard seed
4 leaves fresh curry leaves
1 carrot, peeled and diced
1 zucchini, sliced
1/4 cup frozen peas
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
salt to taste
1/4 cup grated fresh coconut

Directions:
Bring the red lentils, pigeon peas, split yellow peas, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the peas are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more water if needed to keep them from drying out.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mustard seeds, and cook until they begin to sputter and pop, about 2 minutes. Stir in the curry leaves until wilted, then add the carrot, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, peas, turmeric, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked peas and coconut to serve.
