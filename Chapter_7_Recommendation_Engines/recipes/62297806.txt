Ingredients:
20 Egg Yolks
2 litres (8 1/2 US Cups) double cream
400 gms (14 ounces) caster sugar
Vin Santo or similar sweet dessert wine

Directions:
In a heatable bowl, beat the egg yolks and the sugar vigorously until trebled in volume and pale in colour.
Meanwhile bring a pan of water to the boil, reduce the heat and just barely simmer.
Place the eggy bowl over the pan of water (do not let it touch the water!) and cook the custard while stirring continuously. It is done when it has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, a track in the covering holding its form.
When cooked, remove the bowl from the pan and leave to cool.
In another bowl, lightly whisk the cream to a similar texture to the custard, and then mix them all together.
Flavour with the wine and mix throroughly (your choice of how much wine, but if you add a lot, then you might have difficulty geting it to freeze).
Churn in an ice cream machine or freeze in a suitable container, stirring the mixture every 30 minutes or so as it freezes, to get an even consistency.
