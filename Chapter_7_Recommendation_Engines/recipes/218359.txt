Description: 
This one really wasn't that hard to crack...The ingredients are printed on the container! The only difficult part was working out the correct ratios for each spice, or herb... But patient perseverance, and good ol' 'trial and error' saved the day. The original Old BayÂ® Seasoning was invented in the 1940's by an American-German immigrant named Gustav Brunn. Initially, it was intended only for use on crab meat (as there was plenty of it in the Chesapeake Bay area where Gustav lived!), but in the last decade or so, it's used in other food areas, such as poultry and salads.
