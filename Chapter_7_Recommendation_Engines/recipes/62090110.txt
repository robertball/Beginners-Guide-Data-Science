Ingredients:
1/4 red onion, finely chopped
2 slices cooked ham, cut into stripes
2 tsp pizza sauce with oregano
2 tbsp fresh basil finely chopped
125 g broccoli florets
salt and pepper to taste
2 tsp olive oil
150 ml evaporated milk (low fat)
or 150 ml heavy cream
2 tsp raisins, finely chopped
1 tbsp pine nuts or cashews, copped
1/2 tsp corn starch
1-2 slices sandwich cheese
1 tbsp freshly grated parmiggiano
100 g mafaldine or any other wide pasta
basil leaves to garnish

Directions:
Parboil broccoli florets in boiling water for one minute. Drain with cold water. Let water drip off well, pat dry if necessary, set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet and add onion. Cook until evenly golden. Add ham and cook until its flavour blends with the onion. Stir in pizza sauce and milk. Add basil, raisins, nuts and broccoli florets. (You may think the flavour of the basil is going to dissapear during the cooking process, but it's not.)
Add cheese and stir gently until it melts. Add salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer for 5 minutes, stir occasionally. Mix cornstarch with one or two tsp water and stir in. Let simmer until broccoli is nicely al dente.
In the meantime cook pasta and make sure they remain al dente. Cast into a colander (don't drain with any water), stir with a wooden spoon to let remaining water drip off.
Add pasta to the sauce, add parmiggiano, mix well. Once more check the taste. Add salt and/or pepper if needed. Serve with some basil leafes.
