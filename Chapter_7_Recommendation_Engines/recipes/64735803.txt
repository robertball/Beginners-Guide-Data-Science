Ingredients:
2.5 pounds quince
1 lemon, juiced and zested
1 cup water
2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 stick cinnamon

Directions:
Wash the quince under running water removing the fuzzy layer with a soft sponge or fruit brush.
Heat the water and lemon to a simmer.
Peel, core, and dice the quince. Add the diced fruit to the simmering water and lemon.
Bring to a boil. Add the sugar and cinnamon piece. Then reduce to a simmer until the fruit is soft, about 45 minutes.
Remove from the heat source. Remove the cinnamon stick. Add the lemon zest and mix. While hot, pass through a strainer or use an immersion blender to create a semi-smooth consistency.  The jam will thicken upon cooling.
Allow to cool. Pour into sealable jars. The jam will keep in the refrigerator up to two weeks.

Description: 
Quince makes beautiful jam thanks to its deep pink color once cooked. Itâ€™s also naturally high in pectin so it thickens nicely without having to use thickeners. It goes very well with meats and cheeses.
