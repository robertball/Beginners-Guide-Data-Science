Ingredients:
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup white sugar (with 1 TBLS. separated)
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cardamom
2 eggs, room temperature & slightly beaten
4 cups flour
FILLING:
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 cup butter, softened
ICING:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup butter, softened
2 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk and 1 TBLS. sugar, let sit 10 minutes.
Prepare a medium-sized bowl by spraying it with cooking spray. Set aside. Turn oven on to 160 degrees. Once the oven comes up to temperature, turn off (DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR!)
In a large bowl, whisk in the milk/yeast, sugar, butter, salt, cardamom and beaten eggs.  Start adding flour 1/2 cup at a time and mix in as much as you can with a wooden spoon until dough starts to pull away from the sides. On a lightly floured surface, turn dough out and knead in as much of the remaining flour as you can to make it pliable but not too sticky (about 8 minutes). Knead the dough into a ball, put in the oiled bowl, turn dough over to coat, cover with a tea towel and place in warm oven. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and cardamom. Set aside.
After the dough has doubled in size, punch down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest 10 minutes. Again, turn oven to 160 degrees and turn off when it comes up to temperature.
Roll dough into a 16x21 inch rectangle. With an off-set spatula spread dough with 1/2 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture, leaving 1 inch around the edge. Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls into prepared baking pan, cover; place in oven & let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Take out of oven.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake rolls for 20 minutes, or until golden.
While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, 1/3 cup butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt. Spread frosting on rolls while still warm.

Description: 
A little time consuming, but these rolls are worth it. They taste incredibly close to Cinnabon!Modified from: Clone of a Cinnabon
