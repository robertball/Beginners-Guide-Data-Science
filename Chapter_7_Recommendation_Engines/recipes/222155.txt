Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup soft, fresh breadcrumbs
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2/3 cup HeinzÂ® Chili Sauce
2/3 cup red currant jelly

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Gently blend beef, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, onion, garlic, salt and pepper until evenly combined. Form into about 40 bite-sized meatballs.
Place meatballs on a foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet; bake for 20 minutes or until cooked all the way through.
Combine chili sauce and jelly in a saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until jelly dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Add cooked meatballs to the sauce; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Makes 8 servings.
