Ingredients:
3 lbs ground beef
1 large onion chopped
1 lbs bag frozen mixed vegetables
1 8oz bag frozen green beans
2 cans Campbell's tomato soup concentrate
2 28 oz cans petite diced tomatoes.
1 can Rotel.  I like hot.
1 can cream corn
1 can white corn
4 cups beef bullion
1 can pork and beans (optional)
1.5 lbs chopped potato
pepper to taste
salt optional

Directions:
Brown hamburger with chopped onion and drain.
Add all other ingredients except potatoes and bring to a simmer slowly.  If you rush the heating the contents could scorch.  Simmer covered for 2 hours or until vegetables are tender.  Add chopped potatoes and cook until tender.  Letting soup rest after cooking will allow the flavors to marry.
