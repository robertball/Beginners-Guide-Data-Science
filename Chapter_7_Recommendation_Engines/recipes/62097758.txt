Ingredients:
1 small yellow onion, minced
2-3 ribs celery, minced
1 6-oz. can tomato paste
1 packet sloppy joe seasoning powder
1 c. breadcrumbs
1 egg, beaten
Black pepper, to taste
1 lb. ground beef (or turkey)
6-8 slices bacon (or turkey bacon)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Combine all ingredients except beef and bacon in a large mixing bowl.
Add ground beef or turkey to bowl, and gently mix with hands until well-blended.
Place meat mixture on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and shape into a loaf, approximately 5"x9".
Beginning at end of loaf, lay bacon strips across loaf, slightly overlapping to cover.
Bake for 30 minutes at 400 degrees, then decrease temperature to 350 and bake an additional 30 minutes. Use a bulb baster to occasionally remove any accumulated grease on pan.
Let meatloaf rest for 10 minutes, then slice.
