Description: 
The best thing about this cake is how good it tastes. The next best thing is I can prepare it in about 45 minutes, since it gets frosted while still warm. I've even dashed home from work at lunch, baked this dessert and returned with it for an afternoon celebration.         --Rosemary Woodrow, Sparks, Nevada
