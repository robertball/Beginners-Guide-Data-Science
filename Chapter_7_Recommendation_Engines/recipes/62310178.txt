Description: 
This recipe originally called for a large can of hominy to be mixed with cream of mushroom soup, green chilies, and 1 pound of pepperjack cheese for a creamy Mexican-inspired side dish.
I cut the cheese in half, using an 8-oz package of shredded Mexican blend or taco blend cheeses instead of the pepperjack because my husband does not care for spicy food.Modified from: Hominy con Queso
