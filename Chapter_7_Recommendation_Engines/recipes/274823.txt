Ingredients:
1 (14.75 ounce) can salmon, drained and bones removed
1 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 sprigs fresh dill, finely chopped
1 sprig fresh parsley, finely chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives
2 eggs
6 tablespoons Japanese-style panko bread crumbs
1/4 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning (such as GoyaÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup cooking oil

Directions:
Break up salmon into fine pieces and place in a medium bowl. Add onion, garlic, dill, parsley, and chives. Crack both eggs into the bowl. Mix in bread crumbs, lemon-pepper seasoning, and pepper until thoroughly combined. Form salmon patties with a 1/4-cup scoop; set aside.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Place patties in pan and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
These salmon patties make for a quick and great sandwich which can be eaten at lunch or dinner. I usually serve my patties with a creamy dill sauce since it complements the patties perfectly.
