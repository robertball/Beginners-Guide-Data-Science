Ingredients:
2 pounds beef steak or roast
2 cups chopped greens, fresh or frozen
1 lb pasta shells or egg noodles, cooked acording to package directions
cooking oil
3/4 cup water
1/8 cup dried minced onion (or use fresh to taste)
1 teaspoon granulated garlic or fresh
1 tsp beef bullion
salt and pepper to taste
16 oz sour cream

Directions:
Before cooking, cut the beef into bite-sized pieces.
Heat oil in pressure cooker and brown the meat.
When browned, add water, onion, garlic, bullion, salt and pepper to taste.
Cover pressure cooker and cook according to your pressure cooker's directions until the beef is tender.
While beef is cooking, chop the greens.
When beef is tender, open pressure cooker, add the greens and simmer in open pressure cooker until greens are tender.  While cooking the greens, you can add a little more liquid and adjust seasonings, if you prefer.
Lastly, remove the meat, greens from the pressure cooker and into a serving bowl, adding the sour cream at this time. Reserve the cooking liquid and add, as needed, to the serving bowl until the stroganoff reaches the desired consistency.
Stir to blend all ingredients and serve over cooked pasta noodles. Enjoy!

Description: 
A quick and easy throw together for a weeknight meal. I pulled this together one evening with what was in the kitchen. Although I love mushrooms, I did't have any and decided to use greens, instead. Greens and sour cream compliment each other quite well.
