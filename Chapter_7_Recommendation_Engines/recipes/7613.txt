Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
8 egg whites
1/2 cup butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
8 egg yolks
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon brandy flavoring
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup candied cherries, chopped
1/2 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour four 8 inch round cake pans.
Cream 1 cup of the butter or margarine, 2 cups of the white sugar, and vanilla together until light and fluffy.
Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add flour mixture to the butter mixture in three parts alternately with the milk in two parts, beginning and ending with flour.
Beat the egg whites until stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter. Spread the batter evenly into the four prepared pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool. Once cool spread Lane Cake Filling between layers and frost with Seven Minute or Butter Frosting.
To Make Lane Cake Filling: Put 1/2 cup of the butter or margarine and 1-1/4 cups of the white sugar into the top of a double boiler away from the heat.  Beat together.  Add egg yolks and beat well.  Stir in water and brandy flavoring. Place over boiling water.  Cook and stir until thickened.  Add pecans, raisins, cherries and coconut.  Stir filling until all ingredients are well combined. Remove from heat.  Allow filling to cool before spreading between cooled cake layers.
