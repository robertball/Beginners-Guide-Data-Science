Description: 
I use to work at this little bakery where every fall meant we started making cranberry walnut wheat bread. The bread was delicious, especially with the boss's cranberry chutney. That really opened my eyes to the incredible pairing that is cranberries and walnuts. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
