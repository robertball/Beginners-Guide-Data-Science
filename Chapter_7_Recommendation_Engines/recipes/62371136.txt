Description: 
A mole is a stew which incorprates ground chiles, seeds, and sometimes nuts. The basis of a mole verde is the tomate verde, called a tomatillo north of the border. In Mexico, it is the opinion of many cooks that the smaller the tomate verde, the tastier. Sometimes called tomate de cascara, they must be removed from their sticky husk before cooking. This is one of the most popular dishes in Puebla's many marketplace restaurants. This is a shortcut on the traditional preparation with a twist. The substitution of pork for chicken and adding potatoes makes this a favorite of mine.
