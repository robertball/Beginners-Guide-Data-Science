Braised Brisket Recipe

Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped
6 carrots, peeled and chopped
8 oz mushrooms, quartered
2 stalks celery, diced
1/4 cup kosher salt
1 tbsp ground black pepper
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp cinnamon
1 tsp each nutmeg and allspice
1/2 tsp cloves
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
4 lbs beef brisket
3-4 cups cola (recommended: Pepsi)
2 tbsp lemon juice
water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Saute the onion, carrots, mushrooms, and celery in olive oil until tender, but firm. In a baking dish with a lid and enough room for the brisket/liquid, spread the vegetables in a layer.
In a bowl or plastic bag, mix or shake together the salt, pepper, chili powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and cayenne pepper, if desired.
Pat the meat dry with paper towels and then rub generously with the spice mixture. In the same pan that the vegetables were sauteed, sear all sides of the brisket. It should take about two minutes a side and the spice rub will form a crust.
Situate the brisket on top of the vegetables and, while the pan is still hot and the oven is still on, pour about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of the cola into the pan to deglaze. Pour hot cola over the brisket and then the rest of the cola. It will likely not cover the brisket, so fill the rest with water until the brisket is covered with liquid. Add the lemon juice.
Cover and stick in the oven. After an hour, turn the heat down to 325. Cook for three more hours. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving.
