Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 orange bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup diced jalapeno peppers
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups pumpkin puree
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 large tomato, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion, bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in turkey and cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Mix in chicken broth, pumpkin puree, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, tomato sauce, and tomato. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and cumin.
Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until flavors combine, at least 20 minutes. Serve topped with remaining Cheddar cheese and sour cream.

Description: 
This is the perfect soup for a chilly evening or a fall afternoon. I have been asked for this recipe over and over again, it's always a crowd pleaser! It's a little spicy, but the sour cream and cheddar balance out the flavors perfectly.
