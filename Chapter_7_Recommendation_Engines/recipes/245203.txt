Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough, seamless
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAFÂ® Premium Peach Fruit Filling & Topping
1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons cold butter
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, almonds, or pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Unroll the crescent rolls and press into a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake for 5 minutes and cool completely.
Beat the cream cheese, sugar, and extract until smooth. Smooth over the crust and spoon the peach fruit filling over the sweetened cream cheese.
Whisk together the flour and brown sugar then cut in the cold butter to form a grainy crumb. It helps to use your fingers in this process. Toss in your choice of nuts and sprinkle over the peach fruit filling.
Bake for 25 minutes or until the edges are brown and toasty. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.
Serve warm and eat with a fork, or refrigerate and eat with your fingers.
