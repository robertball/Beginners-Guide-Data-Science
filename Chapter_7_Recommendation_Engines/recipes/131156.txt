Ingredients:
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup white sugar
3 slices fresh ginger
3 pounds pork spareribs, cut into bite size pieces
Garlic salt and pepper to taste
all-purpose flour
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
Bring the rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and ginger slices to a simmer over medium-high heat.
Meanwhile, place rib pieces into a large bowl, and season to taste with garlic salt and pepper.  Toss with a little flour to coat, then toss with ginger sauce.  Place ribs onto prepared baking sheet in an even layer.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, then turn ribs over, and bake an additional 45 minutes, until tender.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve.
