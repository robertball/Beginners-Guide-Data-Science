Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup almond milk
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a medium mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the mixture; set aside.
Combine almond milk, egg, and coconut oil in a separate mixing bowl. Add egg mixture all at once to the flour mixture. Stir until batter is just moistened and still lumpy.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Add about 3 tablespoons of blueberries to each cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 22 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Remove muffins by loosening them with a butter knife.
