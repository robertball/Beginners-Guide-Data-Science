Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup cookie butter
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. Mix flour, egg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the butter mixture creating a cookie dough. Roll dough into teaspoon-size balls.
Spread 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow dish. Roll dough balls in the sugar to coat and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. Press dough balls with a fork twice to flatten slightly and press a crosshatch shape into the top of the cookies.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
