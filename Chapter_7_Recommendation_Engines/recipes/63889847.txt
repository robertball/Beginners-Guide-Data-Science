Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1 med. onion, chopped
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 cup barbecue saucewe use Masterpiece Original flavor
1 cup water
1 T chili powder
1 t. ground black pepper
1/2 oz grated unsweetened chocolate (I substitute 1 T cocoa powder for thisit’s less hassle)
1/2 t. ground cumin
1/2 t. turmeric
1/2 t. allspice
1/2 t. cinnamon
1/4 t. ground cloves
1/4 t. ground coriander
1/4 t. ground cardamom
1 t. salt
Tomato juice, as needed
9 oz. spaghetti, cooked and buttered
1 can of red kidney beans, heated
2 chopped onions
2 cups shredded cheese (more or less)
Oyster crackers (optional)

Directions:
Salt a large skillet. Brown meat, onions and garlic on medium heat. Drain any fat. Add the BBQ sauce and water and bring to a boil. Add all the spices.
Cover and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes—add tomato juice if it seems to be getting too dry.
To construct the plate of chili—Put a layer of spaghetti on the plate, top with beans, then hot meat mix, cheese, and sprinkle with onions. If you leave out onions, beans or both, it’s officially called a “Hay wagon”
Traditionally, this dish is served with oyster crackers.

Description: 
This is a family favorite--it's always requested by our grown children when they are home for a visit. We've adapted the recipe from one by Jane and Michael Stern that appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer many years ago.
