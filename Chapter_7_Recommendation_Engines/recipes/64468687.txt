Ingredients:
3 cups flour
15 lizard eggs
1 cup pine needles (still green)
2 cups of sugar
1 T-Bone steak, deboned
3 cups Water
A bunch of powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  In a food processor, combine the steak and lizard eggs. Use the bone from the steak to create a broth (simmer in water on stove for 2 hours).
In a separate food processor, chop the pine needles.  In a mixing bowl, combine pine needles, flour and sugar.  Pour the dry ingredients, steak mixture, and bone broth into a big mixing bowl and combine.
Spoon onto greased baking sheets (1-2 inch balls) and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with as much powdered sugar as you like.  Enjoy!
