Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 cups cider vinegar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 white onion, thinly sliced
1/3 cup dried currants
1/4 cup sweet red wine
3 cloves black garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon dried jalapeno flakes
1 tablespoon dried celery flakes
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 star anise
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Fill a large bowl with cold water and ice cubes.
Bring to a large pot of water to a boil. Add carrots; cook until slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and transfer to the bowl of ice water to cool quickly. Drain.
Combine 1 1/2 cup water, vinegar, sugar, onion, currants, red wine, black garlic, jalapeno flakes, celery flakes, dill weed, star anise, and bay leaf in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add carrots.
Cool carrot mixture to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Pour into a large jar or airtight container. Refrigerate until flavors meld, at least 24 hours.
