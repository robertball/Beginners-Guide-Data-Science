Ingredients:
4 tilapia fillets
1 lemon
lemon pepper (to taste)
2 cloves of garlic, minced.
1/2 tsp sugar
2 heaping tsps mayonnaise
3 Tbls of olive oil
1/2 tsp dried dillweed

Directions:
Place skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and garlic and stir until heated through.
Sprinkle each side of the tilapia fillets with lemon pepper.
Cut off 1/4 of lemon and add juice of cut portion to pan.
Add Tilapia.  Cook each side about 4 minutes or until golden brown.  Do not flip Tilapia more than once- the fish is very soft and does not hold up to a lot of flipping.
While fish is cooking, squeeze remaining lemon juice into a small bowl; remove seeds.
Add mayonnaise, dillweed and lemon pepper to lemon juice; mix well.
Add Sugar, mix well.
Once fish has completed cooking pour lemon cream mixture over each fillet.  Simmer for 4 more minutes.
