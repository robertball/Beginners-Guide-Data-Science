Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 premade pizza dough ( I like the Trader Joes Garlic and Herb)
1 ball of mozzarella (not grated)
1 T minced or crushed garlic
Italian spices
Olive Oil
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Press out the crust with your hands- use corn meal on the crust and on your hands to keep it from sticking until it is a circular shape. Brush with olive oil and spread garlic over that.
Cut or pull apart the mozzarella and spread over the dough.
Sprinkle Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper over top the cheese.
Follow the instructions on baking the crust to cook it- usually 400-ish for about 15-20 minutes until the crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbling.
Cut into pieces and enjoy.
