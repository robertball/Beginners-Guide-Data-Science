Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
3/4 cup frozen lemonade pink concentrate, thawed
4 egg whites
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
Icing:
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 tablespoons frozen lemonade pink concentrate, thawed
1 pinch salt
1 dash red food coloring, or desired amount

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 cupcake cups with paper cupcake liners.
Beat cake mix, 3/4 cup lemonade concentrate, egg whites, water, and vegetable oil together in a bowl with an electric mixer at low speed for about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and continue beating until you have a smooth batter, about 1 minute more. Spoon batter into liners to about 2/3-full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, 2 tablespoons lemonade concentrate, salt, and red food coloring in a bowl with a mixer until smooth and even in color; spread over cooled cupcakes.

Description: 
Refreshing and wonderful for summer, these lemony treats are easy and sure to please. This is the easy version. You can find some made from scratch elsewhere on the internet. I colored half the icing yellow and half pink.
