Ingredients:
¼ cup red wine vinegar
¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
¼ cup olive oil
1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley flakes
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
5  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced

Directions:
Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, parsley, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours.
Preheat grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil the grate. Drain and discard marinade.
Grill chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
