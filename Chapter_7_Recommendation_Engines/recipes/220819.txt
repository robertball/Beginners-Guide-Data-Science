Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine flour, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl to form a dough; stir in pecans.
Shape dough into a large ball and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on a baking sheet.
Make an indentation with thumb in the middle of each ball, forming a 'nest'.
Fill each nest with about 1 teaspoon chocolate chips.
Bake nests in the preheated oven until edges are crisp (cookies will not brown), 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack, about 15 minutes.
