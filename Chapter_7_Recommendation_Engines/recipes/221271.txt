Chicken in Cream Sauce Recipe

NA
Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) whole chicken
2 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
1 cup Mexican crema or sour cream
2  plum tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
2  red peppers, cut into 1-inch chunks
2  jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings
1  onion, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1  bay leaf
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Combine chicken (breast-side up), chicken broth, water, Mexican crema, tomatoes, red peppers, jalapeno peppers, onion, garlic, oregano, bay leaf, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper in a large stockpot, ensuring all ingredients are submerged in the liquid. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.
Turn chicken over using a pair of tongs. Cover stockpot and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from mixture and set aside.
Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface, 5 to 10 minutes.
Cut chicken into serving-size pieces and return to stockpot; stir in chopped cilantro and cook until chicken is warmed through, about 5 minutes.

Aunt Mary's was a popular brunch restaurant in San Francisco that served Mexican and Salvadoran dishes. My wife and I went every Sunday for a late breakfast. She always ordered Huevos Rancheros; my usual was Pollo en Crema.
