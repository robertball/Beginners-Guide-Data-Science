Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cold butter or margarine
1/3 cup molasses
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, separated
sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, ginger, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, combine the molasses, milk and egg yolk until smooth; stir into the flour mixture just until moistened. Turn out onto a floured surface; knead gently 6-8 times. Pat into an 8-in. circle; cut into 12 wedges and place 1 in. apart on a greased baking sheet. Beat egg white until frothy; brush over scones. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
Moist scones with a festive gingerbread flavor were a delightful second course at our ladies' luncheon. They are a scrumptious treat with tea or coffee--and especially nice to serve around Christmas.                                       --David Bostedt, Zephryhills, Florida
