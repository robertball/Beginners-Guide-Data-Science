Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup seasoned salt
2 tablespoons finely ground pepper
2 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 slabs pork ribs, baby back or spare

Directions:
Place all ingredients in ziplock bag or a container with a lid.  Shake to mix well.  Generously rub on both sides of full racks of ribs.  (The moisture of the meat will mix with the rub, so when you are finished, it will no longer look "dry.")
Allow ribs to sit while preparing the grill.  Heat a gas grill to medium. When grill is hot, begin cooking ribs.
Place one rack of ribs in the center of main grill rack.  Cook for 5 minutes, meatiest side down.  Then, move the ribs to the far side of the top grill rack, meatiest side up.  Repeat for the remaining racks of ribs.  Angle the ribs on the top grill shelf so the meatiest sides are facing out and they are stacked, one in front of the other at an angle.  Turn off the heat of the burner directly below the ribs.  Turn the other burner to low.  Close the grill lid.  In 30 minutes, move the position of the ribs.  Flip each rack over, so the side closet to the flame is now farthest away from the flame, with the meatiest side still faceing forward, and the rack that was in the front is now in the back.  Continue to flip every 30 minutes until the outsides are crispy and the meat is tender.  (approximately 3 1/2  hours for baby back ribs, 5 hours for spare ribs.  Slice into smaller chunks and serve.
