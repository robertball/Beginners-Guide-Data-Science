Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup chunky peanut butter
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine brown sugar, peanut butter, and butter in another bowl; beat together with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract. Mix in flour mixture and milk; beat until smooth. Fold chocolate chips into the batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 30 minutes.
