Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa and salt. Set aside.
Melt the shortening in the boiling water, then stir into the flour mixture until blended.  Beat in the eggs, then stir in the vanilla.
