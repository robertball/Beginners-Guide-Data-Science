Ingredients:
2 pounds Bosc pears
1 cup dried cherries
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup hazelnuts

Directions:
Peel, core, and cut pears into 1/2 inch cubes. There should be about 4 cups of fruit.
Combine pears, dried cherries, vinegar, sugar, ginger, pepper, and salt in a heavy large saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 25 minutes.  Remove from heat, and cool to room temperature. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.  Can be prepared 4 days ahead.
Toast hazelnuts at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on an ungreased baking sheet for 5 to 8 minutes.  Husk the nuts, and chop coarsely.  Stir into pear conserve.  Serve at room temperature.
