Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
3 slices bread, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
butter flavored cooking spray
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 pound bacon
1 large head romaine lettuce leaves, torn into bite size pieces
1 (8 ounce) bottle bottled Caesar salad dressing
freshly grated Parmesan cheese to taste
salt and black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) package (6-inch) pocket pita bread, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken in a saucepan with garlic powder, thyme, and rosemary; add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken  is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Remove chicken, let cool, and cut into strips.
Meanwhile, place bread cubes on a baking sheet. Spray with butter spray; sprinkle with garlic salt and parsley.
Bake bread cubes in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Turn cubes; spray again with butter spray and sprinkle with garlic salt and parsley. Bake another 5 to 10 minutes until golden brown and crunchy. Remove croutons, and let cool.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly browned and crispy. Remove bacon from skillet, drain on paper towels and crumble.
Combine chicken, bacon, lettuce, and croutons in a large bowl. Toss with Caesar salad dressing and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss again. Spoon salad mixture into pita bread halves.
