Ingredients:
1 cup (approx. 6 oz) semisweet chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons Frangelico liqueur (optional)
2 tablespoons good-quality cocoa powder, sifted

Directions:
Place chocolate and cream in a small heatproof, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High (100%) for 1 minute or until melted and smooth, stirring with a metal spoon halfway during cooking. Alternatively, melt chocolate and cream in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring constantly.  (Do not allow the bowl to touch the water.)
Stir in Frangelico. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or until firm.
Line a tray with baking paper. Place cocoa powder into a bowl. Dampen hands with cool water, and roll 2 level teaspoons of mixture into a ball. Toss in cocoa powder to coat. Place on prepared tray. Repeat with remaining mixture.
Refrigerate another 20 minutes before serving.  Store truffles in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.
