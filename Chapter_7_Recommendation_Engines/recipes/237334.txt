Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup gluten-free quick-cooking oats
1 small onion, chopped
1 large egg
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons hot sauce, or more to taste
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, oats, onion,  egg, water, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 1-inch balls and arrange into a large baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until very firm, hot, and grey in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain fat from the dish.
Stir hot sauce, butter, and honey together in a bowl until smooth; pour over the meatballs. Turn meatballs to coat.
