Ingredients:
1/4 cup 35% cream (you can use milk but may need more chocolate)
6oz of dark or milk chocolate
Whipping cream
chocolate shavings or cocoa powder in a salt shaker
cinnamon in a salt shaker

Directions:
Bring the cream or milk to a boil in a high sided pan.  (It will heat quickly and boil over the sides so do not leave it!)
As soon as it starts to comes to a boil, remove from the heat and whisk in the chocolate.  It should be a consistency that you can dip a strawberry into and have it hold its shape.  Add more chocolate to get the texture you like.
You can use it at this point, or put it in the fridge, covered, until ready to use.  It will keep 3-4 days.
Make your hot chocolate a little weaker than you normally would.  (if you put in 3tbsp of powder, only use 2tbsp).  Fill with hot water and 1 big tsp of your homemade chocolate mixture.  Stir until melted and creamy.  Put on the whipped cream and sprinkle with the chocolate shavings and cinnamon.  You can also use cocoa powder if you wish.
Serve with fresh fruit also dipped in your chocolate... A winter day doesn't seem so bad now does it?
