Description: 
These are so hearty and satisfying, even those who say, I don't like greens, will eat these up!   You might even get a WOW after the first bite and a, not at all like I remember them tasting.  Good ole country greens with bacon and onion :) You can eat them alone but they're best with hot buttered cornbread.  Mustard, and Turnip greens are great this way too.  Enjoy!
