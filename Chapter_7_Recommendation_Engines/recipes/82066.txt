Ingredients:
2 (7.5 ounce) packages refrigerated buttermilk biscuits (not the layered varieties)
Cornmeal for rolling
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/2 medium Granny Smith apple, cut into small dice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cups shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken
1 (16 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup seedless raisins
1/4 cup chopped pimento-stuffed olives
2 large garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup toasted slivered almonds
Salt and pepper, to taste
Olive oil, for brushing

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to center; heat oven to 450 degrees.
Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and apple until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add spices; saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken, tomatoes, raisins and olives; simmer until filling is thick and moist but not too liquid, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Stir in garlic, almonds, salt and pepper. Transfer to a medium bowl; cool to room temperature.
Separate biscuits onto a cornmeal-coated work surface. Sprinkle with cornmeal as necessary, and roll each one into a 5 inch circle. Fill each one, using a scant 2 Tbs. filling and leaving a 1/2-inch border. Place on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. (At this point, can be frozen up to 2 weeks.)
Brush tops with oil. Bake until golden, 16 to 20 minutes (longer if frozen).

Description: 
Go deep this Super Bowl Sunday: Serve empanadas. These turnovers are perfect 'finger food' -- no knife and fork required. And because the recipes use refrigerated biscuit dough, it's an easy score. All you have to do is make the fillings.
