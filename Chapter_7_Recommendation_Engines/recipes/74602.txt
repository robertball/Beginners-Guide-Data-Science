Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 3/4 cups frozen sweetened strawberries, thawed
2 tablespoons strawberry extract
3 eggs, beaten
2 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups canola oil
1/4 cup frozen sweetened strawberries, thawed, with syrup
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon strawberry extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 5x9 inch loaf pans.
In a bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, beat together the 1 3/4 cups strawberries, 2 tablespoons strawberry extract, eggs, sugar, and oil. Gradually beat the flour mixture into the strawberry mixture. Transfer to the prepared loaf pans.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean. Cool on wire racks.
In a saucepan, mix the 1/4 cup strawberries with syrup, sugar, water, and 1 tablespoon strawberry extract. Bring to a boil, and stir constantly until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Pour over the bread while still warm.
