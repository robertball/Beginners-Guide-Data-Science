Ingredients:
1/2 C Grape Jelly
1/2 C Ketchup
1/2 t Cornstarch
1 pkg Cocktail Wieners (I use all-beef)

Directions:
1. Place about 3 Tablespoons of the jelly into a medium saucepan.  Add the cornstarch.  Heat on medium and blend the cornstarch into the few tablespoons of jelly.
2.  When the cornstarch and jelly are well-blended, add the rest of the jelly.  Break into smaller bits with a rubber spatula.
3.  Add ketchup, stirring to incorporate.
4.  When the ketchup and grape jelly are completely mixed, turn heat to low and add the cocktail wieners.
5. Heat the cocktail wieners for 5 minutes in the mixture or until hot throughout.  Move to a crock pot set on low (or medium if your crockpot has that setting--I use a small 4 qt one that does not.)

Description: 
I got this recipe from my grandma, she makes it for game nights as an appetizer.  It holds well in a crock pot on low after the cocktail weiners are heated through!  They don't taste like grape jelly, it basically makes a sweet and tangy BBQish sauce.
