Ingredients:
1 butternut squash, halved and seeded
3 sweet potatoes
3 bananas
1 stick butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tbs brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
3 cups mini marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.  On a tray,roast squash (skin side up)and potatoes until sqash has browned and softened and potatoes are cooked through soft(you may see some sugars seeping out).  During the last 15 minutes of roasting add the bananas to the tray (skin on) and let them roast until the skin turns almost black.
Put all in a large bowl and cover with foil and let sit for 15 mins. (this will steam the skins off) Peel the skins off the squash, potatoes and bananas and mash togther in the bowl(you can leave it chunkey or smmoth as you like)
Add remaining ingredients except marshmallows and combine completely.  Pour into buttered casserole and top generously with marshmallows(the kids will love to do this part)
Bake 15 to 20 minutes until marshmallows are melted and bubbly
The bananas are the secret ingredient that gives this dish an unusual sweet and rich flavor that nobody can figure out (until now)
