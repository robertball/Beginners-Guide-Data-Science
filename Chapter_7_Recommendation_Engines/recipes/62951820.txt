Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg
1 (17.5 ounce) pouch sugar cookie mix
2/3 cup dark chocolate chips
½ teaspoon orange extract
Few drops of orange food color (to desired shade)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a bowl, beat the cream cheese until soft and fluffy with an electric mixer, then beat in the egg and orange extract until thoroughly combined. Mix in the cookie mix, then add food coloring and mix well.  Fold in the chocolate chips. Drop the dough about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets with a tablespoon or small scoop. Lightly pat the cookies to flatten.

Description: 
If Mis7Up created a “monster” with her RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE COOKIES, then my Halloween version fits right in.  Original recipe was wonderful but I am neither a big raspberry fan nor a fan of white chocolate, which I used as a substitute in the original recipe--I won’t do that again.  Whether you choose the raspberry or the orange--this is a yummy soft cookie.
