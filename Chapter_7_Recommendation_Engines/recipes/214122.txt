Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 onion, chopped
1 pound ground beef
1 (19 ounce) can kidney beans with liquid
1 (19 ounce) can pineapple chunks with juice
1 cup ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons ground mustard
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the skillet and cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain.
Stir the kidney beans with liquid, pineapple with juice, ketchup, brown sugar, cornstarch, mustard, and salt together in a large bowl. Add the ground beef and onions to the mixture and stir to coat. Pour into a large casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until completely heated through, about 45 minutes.
