Ingredients:
3Tbsp brown sugar
4 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp salt
2 tsp pepper
3-4 beef rib slabs (3-4 ribs per slab, about 5 lbs total)
1 C wood chips, soaked for 15 min.

Directions:
1)Make Rub: Combine sugar, chili pwdr, cayenne, S and P in bowl. Pat ribs dry with paper towels and rub sugar mixture all over ribs. (Ribs can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for 24 hours)
2)Steam Ribs- Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Arrange ribs on wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet. Add just enough water to cover pan bottom, then cover pan tightly with foil and bake until fat has rendered and meat begins to pull away from bones, about 2 hours.
3)Smoke Ribs- Tightly seal wood chips in foil packet and cut vent holes in top of packet. Open bottom vent on grill. Light about 100 coals; when covered with fine grey ash, carefully pile on one side of grill. Arrange foil packet directly on coals. Set cooking grate in place and heat, covered, with lid vent open halfway, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 5 min. (For gas grill, place packet directly on primary burner. Heat all burners on high, covered, until wood chips begin to smoke heavily, about 15 min. Leave primary burner on high, shut other burners off.) Scrape cooking grate clean. Arrange ribs on cool side of grill and barbecue, covered, flipping slabs once, until lightly charred and smoky, about 1-1/2 hours. Transfer and tent with foil, let rest 10 min. Serve.
