Ingredients:
24 kiwis, peeled and mashed
3/4 cup pineapple juice
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
3 apples, unpeeled and halved
4 cups white sugar

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine 3 cups mashed kiwi, pineapple juice, lemon juice and apples.  Bring to a boil and then add the sugar; stir to dissolve, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.
