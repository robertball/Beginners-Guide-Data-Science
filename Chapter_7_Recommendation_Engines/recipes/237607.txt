Ingredients:
1 pound halibut, cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 cup lime juice
1 large tomato, seeded and diced
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1/3 cup diced green bell pepper (optional)
1/3 cup chopped green onion
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped, or to taste
4 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place fish into a flat dish; cover with lime juice. Chill fish in refrigerator until tender and opaque, at least 3 hours. Drain lime juice.
Mix tomato, cilantro, green bell pepper, green onion, jalapeno pepper, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl; add fish and stir. Chill in refrigerator until flavors blend, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Super light and refreshing. I use the recipe without the fish (reduce the lime juice) as a topper for grilled tuna. Serves 4 as a lunch, 8 as an appetizer.
