Ingredients:
60ml / 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
3 sprigs of fresh thyme
1 sprig of fresh rosemary, leaves removed from the stem
Peel of half a lemon, cut into thin strips
10oz / 285g mixed olives
1/4 tsp dried fennel seeds with the other herbs to the oil (optional)

Directions:
In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil, garlic, thyme, rosemary and lemon peel over medium-low heat for about 2 to 3 minutes until the garlic and herbs become fragrant.
Add the olives, toss to coat and gently heat until warmed through. Add the Pastis and take off the heat.
Transfer to a jar to cool, then cover and refrigerate for 1 to 3 days to marinate if not using immediately.
Remove jar from refrigerator an hour or two before serving and bring to room temperature.
Alternatively, gently re-heat the olive mixture in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed through and serve. Scoop the olives into serving bowl and drizzle a bit of the warmed oil over the top.
