Ingredients:
1 package Trader Joe's Mushroom Truffle Ravioli
Approximately 2 tbsp chopped onions (or shallots)
1 clove garlic
Approximately 4 tablespoons dry white wine
Approximately 4 tablespoons chicken stock
Approximately 4 tablespoons UNSALTED butter
Pepper to taste
Freshly shaved parmesan

Directions:
Cook ravioli according to directions.  Add a little olive oil and salt to pot when boiling.  Reserve a bit of pasta water to add back to ravioli after draining.
While ravioli is cooking, place onions, garlic, white wine, and chicken stock in small saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Boil for approximately 5 minutes, or until liquid has mostly reduced.  Add pepper and cook a little longer.
Whisk butter into onion mixture 1 tbsp at a time until all butter has been melted.
Immediately toss pasta with sauce.  Serve with grated parmesan.
