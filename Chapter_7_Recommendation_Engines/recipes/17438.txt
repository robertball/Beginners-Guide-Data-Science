Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 1/4 cups butter, softened
3 egg whites
1 cup plain yogurt
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (16 ounce) container caramel flavored frosting
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup cashews

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans. Stir together the flour baking soda and salt, set aside.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Stir in the egg whites and beat until light and fluffy. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk (or yogurt) and vanilla, mixing after each addition. Pour batter into the prepared pans in equal amounts.
Bake cakes for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
Place first layer onto a plate, cover with some of the caramel frosting, drizzle honey over the cake in a criss-cross pattern. Sprinkle with cashews, cover with the next layer and repeat with remaining ingredients. This cake is best when refrigerated for a day, because the honey is absorbed by the cake.
