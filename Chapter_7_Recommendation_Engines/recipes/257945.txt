Ingredients:
coconut oil cooking spray
1 very ripe banana, mashed
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup quinoa flour
1/3 cup whole milk
1/3 cup water, or as needed
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon coconut oil
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Grease a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat.
Combine banana and egg in a bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, quinoa flour, whole milk, water, sugar, honey, coconut oil, kosher salt, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; add to banana mixture until batter is smooth. Add more water if batter is too thick.
Drop batter by 1/3 to 1/2 cup onto the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
This is something I just came up with trying to use up a bag of quinoa and wanted to experiment. The banana and honey balance out the nutty quinoa flavor. Plus the quinoa adds protein. Once I got an mmmmmmmm out of hubby at breakfast, I knew I had to share. Serve hot with butter and syrup.
