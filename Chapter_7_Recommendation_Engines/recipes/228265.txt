Ingredients:
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup brown basmati rice
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Heat grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice, curry powder, garam masala, and cumin seeds. Continue to cook and stir until rice is toasted, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Pour broth into rice mixture and season with salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
