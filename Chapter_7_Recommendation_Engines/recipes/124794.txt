Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup honey
2 eggs
1 cup shredded coconut
1 cup butterscotch chips
4 cups crisp rice cereal

Directions:
Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter until light and fluffy. Add honey, a little at a time; beating well after each addition. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mixture will appear to separate. Gradually add dry ingredients; mix until moistened. Fold in the coconut, chips and cereal.
Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks.

Description: 
This recipe really represents the Midwest to me because of all the bees and honey in the state of Wisconsin. We alone sold more than 90 gallons of honey last fall, and we're just small-scale compared to our neighbors!
