Ingredients:
1.5 sticks butter
1 Tbsp. Liquid smoke
1-2 tsp. Cumin (mostly to taste)
1.5 tsp Beef soup base
1 lb sliced fresh mushrooms
salt & pepper to taste
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
Season salt
Olive Oil
Cheese (italian blend works wonderfully, but mozzarella, provolone, asiago, etc.. would work)

Directions:
In large skillet combine, butter, liquid smoke, cumin, soup base, & mushrooms.  Let them cook down a bit.  Add salt & pepper to taste.
Once mushrooms have cooked down, pour into a bowl and set aside.
Preheat oven to 375.
In skillet add enough olive oil to sear the chicken.  With heat fairly high, add chicken to skillet.  Lightly season salt the chicken. Seer Each side for 2-3 minutes.
Once chicken is seared, pour the sauce, from the mushrooms back into the skillet.  (If you do not have a skillet that can be placed in the oven, transfer the chicken to a baking dish before adding mushroom sauce) With a knife cut a few slits in the chicken to allow the sauce to penetrate the meat.  Cover & place in oven for 15 minutes.  Turn chicken over and bake for 10-15 more minutes, or until the temp is 180 degrees.
Turn broiler on high
Now top chicken with mushrooms and cheese.  Place under broiler until cheese is melted and bubbly.
Serve with your favorites sides.  Enjoy!
