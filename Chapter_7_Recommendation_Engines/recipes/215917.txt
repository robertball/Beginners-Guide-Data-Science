Ingredients:
16 ounces Classico® Creamy Alfredo Sauce
1 pound salmon fillets
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta
1 (6 ounce) package shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Heat Alfredo sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Place salmon in a baking dish. Mix the lemon juice and vinegar in a small bowl, and pour over the salmon. Season with basil and parsley.
Bake salmon 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until easily flaked with a fork. Remove from heat, and break into bite sized pieces.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini, and cook 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and place in a large bowl.
Gently toss the salmon, pasta, and Alfredo sauce together in the large bowl. Serve with the Parmesan cheese.
