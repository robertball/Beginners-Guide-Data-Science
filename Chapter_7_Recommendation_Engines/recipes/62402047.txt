Ingredients:
4-5 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 cup sweet raspberry vinaigrette dressing
1/2 cup blackberry wine
salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste
1/2 cup orange marmalade
1/4 brown sugar
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1/4 cup blackberry wine

Directions:
1.  Use a wooden hammer or rolling pin to pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 an 1/2 inch.
2.  Mix the raspberry vinaigrette, 1/2 cup of blackberry wine, and spices as a marinade.  Place the pounded chicken breasts in the marinade and let them sit for at least an hour.
3.  Mix marmalade and olive oil in a small sauce pan.  Heat gently until the mixture begins to bubble, add wine and sugar, and cook on medium low heat until the mixture is smooth and thickened.  This will be your glaze.
4.  Start up the grill and achieve a medium-low heat.  Grill the marinated breasts on each side, 10-15 minutes, and then continue to grill, basting each breast with glaze as you go.
These breasts can be served with rice or as a garnish for a summer salad.
