Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3 ripe bananas
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
1 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 (1.4 ounce) bars English toffee-flavored candy, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the condensed milk into a small baking dish, and cover with aluminum foil. Place the dish in a larger baking pan. Pour boiling water into the larger pan so it surrounds the smaller dish and comes half way up the sides. Place in preheated oven. Bake 1 hour, stirring twice, until milk turns light brown, thick, and caramelized.
Slice the bananas and arrange on bottom of the graham cracker crust. Pour caramelized milk over bananas, and cool 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
Place the heavy cream in a medium bowl, and whip until soft peaks form. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar; and continue whipping until stiff peaks form. Spread whipped cream over cooled caramel. Sprinkle with crushed toffee. Chill 3 hours before serving.
