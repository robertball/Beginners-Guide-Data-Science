Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 pounds ground chicken breast (or 85\15 beef)
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained
1 small can of black olives, pitted sliced and drained
1 (14-oz) can diced fire roasted tomatoes
1 (4-oz) can diced green chilies
3 tablespoons Goya Sofrito
1 cup frozen corn kernels
Salt
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar or shredded pepper jack
2 scallions, finely chopped
Sour cream, or, plain yogurt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Preheat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil - twice around the pan.
When hot, add meat and season with chili powder, cumin, sofrito and red onion.
Brown the meat, 5 minutes.
Add the fire roasted tomatoes, chiles, black beans and corn. Heat the mixture through, 3 to 5 minutes then season with salt, to your taste.
Coat a 9x9 baking dish with remaining extra-virgin olive oil, about 1 tablespoon oil.
Cut the tortillas in half or quarters to make them easy to layer with.
Build lasagna in layers of meat and beans, then tortillas, then cheese. Repeat: meat, tortilla, cheese again. Do this until you end up just below rim of baking dish.
Top with remaining cheese and olives.
Bake lasagna 12 to 15 minutes until cheese is brown and bubbly.
Top with the scallions and serve with a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt.
