Ingredients:
1 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup light butter, melted
3 tsp cinnamon, divided
3 tart apples (i.e. Granny Smith), peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1/2 cup dried cranberries or raisins
1/2 to 1 cup chopped pecans (walnuts)
1 loaf Italian or French bread, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1 1/2 cups egg substitute (equivalent to 6 lg eggs)
1 1/2 cups skim milk
1 TBSP vanilla

Directions:
Spray a 13x9 in. baking dish with cooking spray.  Combine brown sugar, light butter, and 1 tsp. cinnamon in the bottom of the dish.
Add apples, cranberries (raisins), and nuts; toss to coat well.  Spread the apple mixture evenly over the bottom of the dish.
Arrange bread slices on top, overlapping slightly until apple filling is completely covered.
Mix eggs, milk, vanilla, and remaining 2 tsp. cinnamon until well blended.  Pour mixture over bread, soaking bread completely.  Cover and refrigerate 4-24 hours.
Bake, covered with aluminum foil, in a preheated 375 degree oven for 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake 5 minutes; remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
I received this recipe from a coworker and made it for Easter brunch this year.  It was easy to assemble and tasted fantastic--it was an instant hit with my family!  I modified the original recipe, using low-fat egg/dairy products.
