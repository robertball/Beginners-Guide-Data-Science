Ingredients:
for 2 large pasta bowl size servings
one 13 ounce box of lingiuni cooked according to package directions and drained.
2 - 3 tbs olive oil
5 medium or 3 large bell peppers. Mix and match colors or all green.
3 medium size or 2 large ripe yellow tomatoes (any juicy ripe tomatoes are ok)
1 tsp or 2-3 cloves chopped garlic
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp coarse black pepper
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp basil
dash red pepper flakes
1/4 cup parmesean cheese
favorite grated italian cheese for garnish

Directions:
Cook lingiuni, drain and toss with a bit of olive oil to keep it from sticking together and set aside(save about 1/2 cup of the pasta water just in case)
While pasta is cooking add olive oil to your favorite large fry pan or saute pan on medium heat.
Seed and Slice bell peppers into strips (like you would for fajitas) add them to the pan and raise heat to medium high.
add the garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, basil and red pepper flakes
Cook the peppers tossing them around in the pan untill they begin to get some carmelization going (don't want them too soft)
Add the sliced tomatoes when they begin to cook down a bit add the parmesean cheese and linguini to the pan. When the lingiuni is hot transfer to bowls or plates garnish with some good grated cheese like Parmigiano-Reggiano, Pecorino Romano or asiago - to you liking and enjoy.
