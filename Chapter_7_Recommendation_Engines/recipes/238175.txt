Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup beer
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch salt, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 sweet onion, cut into 1/4-inch wide rings
1 pound bacon
1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Whisk flour, beer, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until batter is evenly mixed; cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
Wrap bacon around each onion ring and arrange on a plate; refrigerate.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Dip wrapped onion rings in batter, shaking off any excess. Place battered onion rings onto a plate while dipping the rest; do not stack.
Fry battered onion rings, working in batches, in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked onion rings to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
