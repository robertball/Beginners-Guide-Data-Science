Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can beer
2 limes, juiced
3 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, sliced
6 cloves garlic, sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 (12 ounce) pork tenderloins

Directions:
Stir beer, lime juice, chipotle peppers, garlic, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; let sit 1 hour.
Place pork tenderloins in a baking dish; pour marinade over tenderloins. Refrigerate 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook in preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
