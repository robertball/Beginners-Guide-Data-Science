Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons liquid honey
1 pound shallots, peeled and quartered
4 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
7 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat; stir in honey and shallots. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper and cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn shallots to brown evenly.
Pour balsamic vinegar into the skillet with the shallots. Reduce heat to low and simmer until shallots are soft, about 7 minutes.
Serve warm or store shallots in the refrigerator in a sealed container until chilled.
