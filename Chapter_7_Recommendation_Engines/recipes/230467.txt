Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, or as needed
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil; lightly spray with cooking spray.
Arrange crackers in the prepared jelly roll pan.
Mix sugar and butter together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Pour butter mixture over crackers.
Bake crackers in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from oven.
Sprinkle chocolate chips over the hot crackers; spread chocolate chips with a rubber spatula until melted. Top with walnuts. Refrigerate chocolate bark until set; break into pieces.
