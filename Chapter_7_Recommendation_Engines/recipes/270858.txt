Ingredients:
4 cups peeled and diced butternut squash
1/2 onion, diced
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chipotle powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
cooking spray
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
3 ounces crumbled goat cheese
1 (14 ounce) can enchilada sauce
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas
2 ounces crumbled cotija cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine butternut squash, onion, olive oil, and garlic on a baking sheet; toss well. Sprinkle chipotle powder and salt over the top.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring once, until butternut squash is tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray a 10x6-inch casserole with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce over the bottom.
Add black beans and goat cheese to the butternut squash mixture; mix gently to keep the goat cheese in good-sized pieces.
Pour some enchilada sauce onto a small plate. Quickly dip each tortilla into the sauce and fill with some of the squash-bean mixture. Roll up and place seam-side down in the prepared casserole dish. Tuck any remaining filling into the exposed ends of the enchiladas. Spoon remaining sauce over the enchiladas. Top with cotija cheese and cilantro.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 25 minutes.
