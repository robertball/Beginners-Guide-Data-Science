Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 cup uncooked white rice
3 tablespoons butter, divided
2 eggs
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup canned sliced mushrooms
1/2 small onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and mix in soy sauce. Add rice and stir until the water returns to a rapid boil, about 5 minutes. Cover and reduce heat to very low. Cook until rice can be fluffed with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove rice from heat and mix in 1 tablespoon butter to prevent rice from sticking to the pan. Let rice cool about 15 minutes, then transfer to a container and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Remove rice from the refrigerator. Beat eggs together in a bowl.
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over high heat. Add eggs and cook about 1 minute. Add carrots, mushrooms, and onion and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Add cooled rice and remaining butter to the skillet. Stir until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
