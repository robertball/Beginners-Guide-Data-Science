1 glazed raised ring doughnut, halved horizontally
2 slices Gouda cheese

Spread butter onto the cut sides of the doughnut.
Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Place 1 doughnut slice, butter side down, into the skillet. Lay Gouda cheese on doughnut slice; top with remaining doughnut slice, butter side out. Flatten with a spatula. Cook, flipping once, until lightly browned on both sides and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes.
