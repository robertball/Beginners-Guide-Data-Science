Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package pretzel sticks
1 (14.4 ounce) package graham crackers, crumbled
1 (10.5 ounce) package marshmallows
1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate confectioners' coating
1/2 cup peanuts, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Lay a sheet of wax paper on a work surface.
Place graham cracker crumbs in a bowl. Place peanuts in a separate bowl.
Insert 1 pretzel stick into each marshmallow, almost all the way through.
Melt chocolate coating in a microwave-safe 2-cup glass measuring cup in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Dip the marshmallows into the melted chocolate; pull out and twirl to remove excess coating.
Spoon graham cracker crumbs over the coated marshmallows; turn to let excess crumbs fall into the bowl. Repeat with peanuts. Set s'mores on the waxed paper to dry, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
My kids love these snacks anytime of the year. They are great for bake sales, too! I like to use the giant marshmallows when I can find them. Store in airtight container.
