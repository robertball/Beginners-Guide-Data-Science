Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 pounds bison meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup minced yellow onion
1/2 cup minced celery
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons flour
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup water
2 tablespoons white wine
1 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 whole cloves
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat; brown the bison in oil, 2 to 3 minutes per side; remove bison and set aside. Pour 1 tablespoon canola oil into the Dutch oven; cook and stir the onion and celery in the oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic; cook and stir another 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to coat. Stir in the broth, water, wine, salt, pepper, cloves, tomato sauce, parsley, and thyme to the mixture; bring to a boil. Return the bison to the mixture and stir through. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until meat is fork tender, about 1 hour.
