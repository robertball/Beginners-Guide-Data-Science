Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into small cubes
cooking spray (such as PamÂ®)
4 cloves garlic, diced
1/4 onion, diced
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/2 small head red cabbage, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons chili sesame oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon lime juice (optional)
1 teaspoon soy sauce to taste
1 teaspoon chili-garlic sauce
1 teaspoon tamarind paste, or to taste
1 teaspoon grated lime zest (optional)
20 egg roll wrappers
2 teaspoons peanut butter, divided

Directions:
Place tofu on several layers of paper towels. Cover with more paper towels. Let drain, pressing down occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl. Cook and stir onion and green onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir into garlic in the bowl. Cook red cabbage until slightly tender, about 3 minutes. Add to garlic and onion mixture. Cook eggs, stirring frequently, until scrambled, about 3 minutes. Stir into bowl.
Stir 1/4 cup peanut butter, chili sesame oil, lime juice, soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, tamarind paste, and lime zest into bowl; toss until vegetable and egg mixture is evenly coated.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spoon a small amount of filling into the middle of an egg roll wrapper. Fold over bottom and sides to enclose filling. Roll wrapper upwards to a form a neat roll shape. Use a pea-sized dot of peanut butter on the flap to seal. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.
Arrange rolls on a baking sheet. Lightly spray all sides with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I love Pad Thai and wanted to get the flavor of the dish without all the carbs of the noodles. These baked egg rolls really capture the flavor of Pad Thai.
