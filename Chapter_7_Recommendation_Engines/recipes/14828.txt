Description: 
Portobello mushrooms marinated in balsamic vinegar and rosemary, then grilled - these are heaven. If you don't have a grill, they're also delicious fried in a skillet.  Portobello mushrooms are extremely large, dark brown mushrooms that are simply the fully mature form of the crimini mushroom, a variation of the common white mushroom.
