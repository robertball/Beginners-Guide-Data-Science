Ingredients:
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes, or more to taste
2 tablespoons green curry paste (such as Thai Kitchen®)
1 stalk celery, finely sliced
1 small red bell pepper, halved and cut into slivers
1 cup coconut milk (such as Chaokoh®)
1 pound medium cleaned raw shrimp, or more to taste
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Pour 1 tablespoon peanut oil into a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and hot pepper flakes. Stir and cook until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Add remaining oil and green curry paste. Stir and cook about 1 more minute.
Add celery and red bell pepper to the skillet with the onion mixture. Continue cooking and stirring until tender-crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in coconut milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until reduced by 75%, about 10 minutes.
Add shrimp to the skillet with the curry and cook until they turn pink, about 2 minutes. Season with fish sauce and cilantro.
