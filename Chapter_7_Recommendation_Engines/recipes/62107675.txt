Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 English muffin, split and toasted
Real mayonnaise
1 egg
1 T milk
salt to taste (I use about 1/16 of a teaspoon of salt per egg)
1 slice of Canadian bacon
1 slice of Colby cheese, thinly sliced

Directions:
Spread each slice of the muffin with mayonnaise and place a slice of Canadian  bacon on top. Set aside.
Break egg into a microwavable small bowl. (I use a small Corelle cereal bowl.)
Add milk and salt and stir until egg yolk is broken and all ingredients are well mixed.
Cook in microwave for 1 minute on high.
Run a thin spatula or knife around the edge of the egg, lift it up and flip the egg back into bowl.
Return egg to microwave for another minute on high.
Remove egg from bowl and lay it on top of  the slice of Canadian bacon. Top with a slice of Colby cheese and return to the microwave for 20 seconds or so - until cheese is melted.
Top with the other English muffin half and enjoy!

Description: 
This is my version of the Egg McMuffin you get at McDonald's. You can play around with the ingredients and substitute to your heart's content. I often make these sanwiches for my family in the morning using plain whole wheat toast and no meat. The secret is to use mayonnaise and cheese - along with the egg of course - every time! If you want to serve these sandwiches as part of an elegant brunch, substitute Hollandaise Sauce for the mayonnaise.
