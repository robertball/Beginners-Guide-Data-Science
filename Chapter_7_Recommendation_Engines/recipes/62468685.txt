Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup + 1 tbsp raw brown sugar, Turbinado sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp allspice
1/8 tsp cloves
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 egg whites
1 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup honey
1 tablespoon molasses
1/2 C + 2 tbsp dried cranberries
pumpkin spice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and grease a 12 cup muffin pan.
Place the dried cranberries in a bowl and hot water to cover. Let stand for a few minutes to rehydrate.
In a large bowl, mix together the flour, 1/2 C. sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg whites.  Gently fold in the other wet ingredients: Vanilla, pumpkin, applesauce, molasses and honey.
Create a well in the dry ingredients and fold in the pumpkin mixture.  Mix just until the dry ingredients are absorbed. Drain the water from cranberries, reserve about 2 tablespoons for topping the muffins, and fold the rest into the batter.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared muffin cups, until they are almost full.  Top each muffin with additional cranberries, a sprinkle of sugar and a dash of pumpkin spice.
Bake for 18-20 minutes in a preheated oven, or until the muffins tops are no longer sticky.  You can test with a toothpick, but the muffins are to be moist, so they should not be completely dry inside.
Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing and cooling completely on a rack.
