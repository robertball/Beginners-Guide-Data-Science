Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
4 large tomatoes
1/2 cup bread crumbs
garlic powder, to taste
herbes de province, to taste
salt
pepper

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350Â°.
Slice off the tops of the tomatoes and set aside. Carve out the flesh of the tomato and conserve, along with the juice, in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle some salt inside the tomato and set upside-down in the casserole.
Remove the tomato cores from the mixing bowl. Chop them into smaller pieces and add to the casserole.
To the mixing bowl, add the ground beef, bread crumbs and spices. Mix together with hands. As everyone's tastes are different, add a small amount of spices in the beginning and add more as necessary.
Turn over the tomatoes and stuff them with the meat mixture so that a small amount rises above the top. Place the tops of the tomatoes back on. Roll up any leftover meat mixture in small balls and add to the casserole dish.
Place casserole in oven and let cook for 40 - 45 minutes. Serve with rice.
