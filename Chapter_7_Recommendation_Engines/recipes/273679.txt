Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed
14 (8 inch) flour tortillas
6 cups water
3 cups red lentils, rinsed and drained
1 onion, chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
2 teaspoons bottled minced garlic
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 cups chopped tomatoes
3 cups chopped yellow squash
2 1/4 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook tortillas in batches until crispy, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Set aside on plates covered with paper towels to drain.
Combine water, lentils, onion, cilantro, garlic, cumin, and salt in a medium pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until lentils are tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes. Use a fork to mash the cooked lentils.
Set an oven rack about 5 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Spread lentil mixture over the crispy tortillas. Top with tomatoes, squash, and Monterey Jack cheese. Arrange tostadas on a large baking sheet.
Broil tostadas until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.
