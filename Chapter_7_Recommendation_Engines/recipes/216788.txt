Ingredients:
1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
1 pound hot Italian sausage, casings removed
1/2 pound ground beef
1 large onion, finely diced
1/4 cup minced garlic, or to taste
4 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (14 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)
1 tablespoon dried Italian herb seasoning
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in Italian sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until the meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 15 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash and blend the meat mixture every few minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, chicken broth, red wine, Italian seasoning, basil, salt, and black pepper.
Transfer the sauce to a slow cooker and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours.

Description: 
Although my grandma was Danish, she was famous for her slow-cooked Italian tomato sauce. It cooks a long time, but is well worth the wait.
