Ingredients:
2 tablespoons whole milk
1 egg
3/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/2 (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli, thawed
3 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
16 ounces Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce

Directions:
Combine milk and egg in a small bowl.  Place breadcrumbs and if desired, salt in a shallow bowl. Dip ravioli in milk mixture, and coat with breadcrumbs.
In a large saucepan, heat pasta sauce over medium heat until bubbling. Reduce the heat to simmer.
In a large heavy pan, pour oil to depth of 2 inches. Heat oil over medium heat until a small amount of breading sizzles and turns brown. Fry ravioli, a few at a time, 1 minute on each side or until golden.  Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately with hot pasta sauce.
