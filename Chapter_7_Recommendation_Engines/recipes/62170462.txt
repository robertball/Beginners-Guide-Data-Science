Ingredients:
2 steaks, preferably filet mignon or beef eye round (cheaper)
1 large shallot, finely chopped
1-2 tablespoons (depending on taste) of Dijon mustard
1/4-1/3 cup of red wine
beef broth as needed, about 1/3 cup

Directions:
1. Rub the steaks with olive oil, and season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.
2. Preheat the oven to 400.
3. When the chill has come off the steaks, bring a large (not-not stick) skillet that is ovenproof to heat over a high flame.
4.  Place the steaks in the pan and sear one side for 2 minutes. Flip and sear the other side for 2 minutes.
5. Put the steaks into the oven to finish cooking. Cook to your desired doneness, about 6-7 minutes for rare-medium rare, 8 minutes for medium-medium well.  Tastes best as rare. Turn the flame down to medium-low.
6.  Remove the pan and place back on the flame.  Remove the steaks and set aside.  If there are large amounts of pan juices, drain all but a little.
7.  Add the shallot and cook down about 2-3 minutes.  Add red wine, and deglaze the pan.  Let the wine reduce down.  Whisk in the mustard, and add broth.  Continue to cook down to desired consistency.  If needed, add more broth to loosen the sauce.
8.  Serve over bed of arugula and fig.  Spoon sauce over the steak, and drizzle the plate with the remaining sauce.

Description: 
This is a delectable steak, pan seared to keep the juices in, topped with a rich pan sauce of mustard, wine and shallots.  Serve over a pile of peppery-sweet arugula and fig salad tossed in a red-wine vinaigrette. Makes a great date dinner.
