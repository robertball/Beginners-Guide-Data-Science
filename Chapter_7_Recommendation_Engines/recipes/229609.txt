Ingredients:
1 habanero pepper, seeded and diced - or more to taste (wear gloves)
1 cup low-sodium tomato juice
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 fluid ounces premium vodka, divided

Directions:
Place habanero pepper, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, cumin, and salt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Adjust level of spice by adding more habanero pepper, if desired. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.
Fill 2 old fashioned glasses with ice, pour 2 ounces of vodka in each glass, and top off with bloody mary mix.

Description: 
I had an larger-than-expected harvest from my habanero plant and came up with this idea for a bloody mary with a kick. Also pretty good without the vodka as a morning start-me-up drink. The longer it sets, the hotter it gets. I have yet to have a batch make it past the 2nd day.
