Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
3 large chicken breasts
1 large onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, crushed
13 cups water
2 cups white wine
3/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 (4 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
7 whole black peppercorns
4 cubes chicken bouillon
3 bay leaves
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 cup peeled and sliced carrots
2 stalks celery, diced
1 kohlrabi bulb, peeled and diced
2 1/2 tablespoons fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons fresh thyme
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated ginger
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken, onion, and crushed garlic cloves; cook in hot oil until chicken breast is browned and onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes . Pour water, white wine, and lemon juice over the chicken mixture; stir sliced ginger, peppercorns, chicken bouillon, bay leaves, and white sugar into the liquid. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 45 minutes.
Remove and discard the crushed garlic cloves. Remove chicken breasts from the soup to a cutting board; chop into bite-size pieces.
Add carrot, celery, kohlrabi, rosemary, and thyme to the soup. Reduce heat to low until the vegetables begin to soften, about 20 minutes.
Bring the soup to a boil. Return chopped chicken to the soup along with the egg noodles, minced garlic, and grated ginger; remove the pot from heat and let sit until the noodles have softened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Garnish with parsley.

Description: 
A spicy addition to a classic soup. I normally make this with a whole chicken and let it cook for an hour, remove the meat, and return the bones for another hour on their own, chicken breasts are used here for simplicity.
