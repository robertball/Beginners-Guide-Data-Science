Description: 
THIS IS one of my favorite ways to prepare carrots--simple but flavorful. I devised this recipe since we always seem to have carrots on hand, and the dish has drawn quite a few compliments. Sometimes I'll make extra and add them to my 'soup jar' in the freezer--they make a great addition to a batch of homemade soup!                                                --Donna Smith                                                              Palisade, Colorado
