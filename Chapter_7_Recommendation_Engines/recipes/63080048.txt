Description: 
This is my version of 'Marcia's Famous Sticky Buns,' submitted by Colleen. I make these every Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. We call them Cinnamon Rolls even though I haven't 'rolled' them in years (= We love that you do all the prep work before bed, and then have hot, fresh 'cinnamon rolls' in the morning. (As long as I don't flip them out into the kitchen sink! [Remember the Great Thanksgiving Cinnamon Roll Tragedy?])
