Vermont Apple Slab Pie Recipe

Ingredients:
2 refrigerated uncooked pie crusts
4 cups apples, peeled, cored and sliced (about 4-5 apples)
1/2 cup crushed cornflakes (regular or sweetened)
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1/3 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line an 8 x 8 inch baking dish with nonstick foil, using 2 pieces so you have some overlap hanging over all sides.
Cut the pie crust dough into rough 9 x 9 inch squares. Place the first square in the baking dish, pressing the edges a little ways up the sides. Scatter the cereal over the dough, and then put the apples in a layer on top of the dough. Stir the cinnamon into the sugar and then pour the cinnamon sugar evenly over the apples. Top with the second crust and press the edges down towards the bottom crust. They don't have to be sealed. Cut a few steam slices in the top crust and bake until golden, 50-60 minutes.
Cool in the pan for about ten minutes and then carefully remove from the pan, using the foil edges as handles. Cool on a rack in the foil until completely cool. The waiting is the hardest part! When the pie is cool, make the glaze by mixing the maple syrup into the powdered sugar. If it is too thick add a little more syrup. Carefully transfer the pie from the foil to a serving plate (I use two big spatulas for this) and then drizzle the glaze over the top. Use it all! Cut into slabs and serve.
