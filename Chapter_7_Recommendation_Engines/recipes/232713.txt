Ingredients:
1/2 loaf dry French bread, broken into pieces
3 tablespoons butter, melted
8 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (1/4 inch thick) ham slice, coarsely chopped
1 3/4 cups milk
9 eggs
4 green onions, minced
1/4 cup sherry
1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange bread pieces in the prepared baking dish; drizzle with melted butter. Top with Swiss cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, and ham.
Whisk milk, eggs, green onions, sherry, mustard, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until foamy; pour over bread mixture. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate for 24 hours.
Remove dish from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bake strata in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove aluminum foil and top with sour cream and Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, until a knife inserted in the strata comes out clean, about 10 more minutes.
