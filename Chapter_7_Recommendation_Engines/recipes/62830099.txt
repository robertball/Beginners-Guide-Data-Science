Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup all-purpose flour for coating
1 cup butter
SAUCE
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons water
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut wings in half, dip in egg and coat with flour.
Heat butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry wings until deep brown.  Place in a shallow roasting pan - using parchment paper for easy clean-up.
In a small bowl combine soy sauce, water, sugar, vinegar, garlic powder and salt.  Pour over wings.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, basting wings with sauce often. (I didn't baste often...I turned them once, and they were fine!)
