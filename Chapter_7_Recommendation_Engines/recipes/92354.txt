Ingredients:
1 pound bulk pork sausage
5 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn
1/2 onion, diced
1 cup uncooked macaroni (optional)
8 ounces processed cheese food, cubed
1 pinch salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Crumble the sausage into a Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, stirring and breaking into smaller chunks. Drain grease. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is beginning to soften.
Put in the potatoes, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and stir in the macaroni. Pour in the cans of creamed corn and whole corn with the juice from the can.
When the pasta and potatoes are tender, remove from heat and stir in the processed cheese until melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the chowder is too thick, stir in milk or water to thin before serving
