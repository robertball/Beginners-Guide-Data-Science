Ingredients:
3 cup fresh blueberries
2/3 cup honey
juice of 1 lemon

Directions:
Place a small saucepan over medium heat.
Add blueberries to cook until they are heated up and juice begins to come out from the berries.
Then add blueberries, honey and lemon juice.
Mix well and cook for about 5-7 minutes then reduce heat and cook for another 5-7 minutes until berries have fully exploded and everything has broken down into a well combined mixture.
The longer you let the jam sit on low, the more it will thicken so feel free to lower the heat and go watch a trash tv show. Like I did.
