Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups plain flour
2 tablespoons (30g) ghee
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1/2 cup warm water (approximately)
vegetable oil for deep-frying
For Filling:
1 1/2 tablespoons (20g) ghee
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground tumeric
1/4 teaspoon chilli powder
1/2 cup (130g can) corn kernels, rinsed, drained
1/4 cup coconut milk

Directions:
Sift flour into bowl, rub in ghee (30g), add caraway seeds, gradually stir in enough water to mix to a firm dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth.
Cover with plastic wrap, refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.
While dough refrigerates, heat 20g ghee in pan, add onion, garlic, ginger and spices, stir over heat until onion is soft. Add corn, peas and coconut milk, bring to boil, remove from heat; cool to coom temperature.
Roll pastry on floured surface until 2mm thick.
Cut pastry into 9.5cm rounds, and place a rounded teaspoon of filling in centre of each round.
Brush edges with water, press edges together with thumb/finger, samosa presser or dumpling press.
Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.
Deep-fry samosas in hot oil until browned.

Description: 
The samosa presser is available from Asian grocery stores, but I use a dumpling press and it works just as well. I love these tasty treats and they are always gobbled up quickly.
