https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup oat bran
1 cup oatmeal (uncooked, regular)
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 t. baking powder
1/2 t. baking soda
1 T. cinnamon
1 1/2 cup diced plums (I use Santa Rosa Plums, with the skin, no need to peel)
water
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses

Directions:
1.  Mix dry ingredients - oat bran, oatmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon.
2.  Dice and measure plums.  To the 1 1/2 cups of plums, add water so the total volume is still 1 1/2 cups.
3.  Combine wet ingredients - plums and water, egg, molasses.
4.  Add wet ingredients to dry, mixing just until all is moistened.
5.  Spoon into greased muffin pan.
6.  Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 15 minutes.
