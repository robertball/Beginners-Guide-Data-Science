Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
16 oz salsa verde (I like Mrs. Renfro's Hot Green Salsa)

Directions:
Coat the bottom of the crock pot with a thin layer of salsa.  Place the chicken breasts in the crock pot.  Pour the rest of the salsa evenly over them.  Cook for 3 hours on high.
Shred the chicken with two forks.  Cook for another 15 minutes on low.
