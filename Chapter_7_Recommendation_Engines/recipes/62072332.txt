Ingredients:
4 C water
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces (fresh or frozen)
1/2 16-oz pkg. spiral pasta
1 can cream of chicken soup
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 small-medium onion, chopped
1 C flour
1 1/2 tsp double-acting baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp dried basil
1 Tbsp dried parsley
2 Tbsp shortening
1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 C milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F.  Bring the water and chicken to a boil.  Add pasta and boil, stirring occasionally, 6-8 minutes until just shy of being done.
Meanwhile, mix flour, baking powder, salt, basil, and parsley in medium bowl.  Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Gently stir in cheese then slowly add milk, mixing just until combined.
When pasta mixture has boiled for 6-8 minutes, DO NOT DRAIN.  Turn off heat and add cream of chicken soup, crushed garlic, and onion. Pour into 3 quart casserole dish.
Top with evenly spaced tablespoons of biscuit dough.  Cook in 450°F oven for 10-12 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown.  Let sit 5 minutes before serving.
