Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2/3 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon vanilla sugar
16 teaspoons raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 16-cup muffin tin with muffin liners.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour, baking powder, and vanilla sugar; beat to combine.
Divide dough in 1/2 and divide each 1/2 into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place a ball of dough into each prepared muffin cup; make a small indentation in the center of each dough ball with a flour-coated thumb. Fill each indentation with a teaspoon of raspberry jam.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes.
