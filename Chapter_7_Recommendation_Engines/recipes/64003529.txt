1 T plus 1 tsp table salt
1 pound elbow macaroni
5 T butter
6 T all purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp cayenne (opt)
5 cups milk
8 oz Monterey Jack cheese (2 cups)
8 oz Cheddar cheese (2 cups)

Directions:
Prepare macaroni by brining a large pot of water to boil with 1 T of salt.  Cook until tender just past the al dente' stage.  Drain and set aside.
Melt butter over medium high heat.  Add flour, mustard, cayenne, and remaining tsp of salt and whisk well to combine.  Continue to whisk and cook until color deepens, apx 1 minute.
Add milk (continuing to constantly whisk) and bring to a full boil (needed to thicken).  Reduce heat to medium and simmer, whisking occasionally, until mixture reaches the consistency of thick cream (apx 5 minutes).
Remove from heat and whisk in cheeses, stirring until completely melted.
Stir in pasta, return to medium low heat, and continue to cook and stir until mixture is heated through (apx 5 to 6 minutes).
