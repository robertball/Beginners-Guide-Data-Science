Description: 
Great snack to eat on New Year's Day while watching the games!  My husband likes this really spicy, so I use even more jalapeno.  Fritos Scoops make the perfect eating utensil!  It could also be tossed with some cooked pasta and eaten as a salad.  Makes about sixteen 1/2 cup servings as written.Modified from: Texas Caviar
