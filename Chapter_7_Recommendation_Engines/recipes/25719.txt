Ingredients:
1 2/3 pounds sugar pumpkin -- peeled, seeded and cubed
2 carrots, coarsely chopped
2 onions, cut into wedges
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large potato, sliced
1 quart water
3 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled
1 cup heavy cream
1 1/4 tablespoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place pumpkin, carrots and onions in a baking dish or roasting pan.  Drizzle with vegetable oil.
Bake in preheated oven 40 minutes, until soft but not blackened.
In a large pot over medium heat, bring water and bouillon to a boil.  Cook potato in simmering water until soft, about 20 minutes.
Combine potato and water with roasted vegetables and puree in a blender or food processor or using an immersion blender until smooth.  Return to pot over low heat, and stir in cream, nutmeg, pepper and salt.  Heat gently; serve.

Description: 
Serve with crusty bread and a dollop of extra cream for decoration. Try to find a really dark orange-colored pumpkin--it will look lots better. Enjoy!
