Description: 
This recipe is a delicious Icelandic specialty. It is served by families during the winter holidays and is a restaurant specialty in coastal towns around the island. After a vacation to Iceland, I searched fervently for the recipe, and through research with trial and error, came up with this very authentic version. The soup is best enjoyed with slices of baguette.
