Description: 
Beantown's Joy Richards, the bar manager of the Franklin Restaurant Group, stood out above the rest at Anchor Distilling's 'Tales of Two Cities: Beantown and Barbary Coast,' where top bartenders from San Francisco went head-to-head with the best from Boston. Her Sixth Sense cocktail put a traditional pina colada to shame when she mixed it up with Anchor Distillings's own Junipero gin, which is created right in San Francisco.
