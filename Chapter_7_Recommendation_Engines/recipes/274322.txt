Ingredients:
2 large eggplants, halved lengthwise
2 Roma tomatoes, halved lengthwise
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 cup tahini
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 clove garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 teaspoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Brush cut sides of eggplant and tomatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Place eggplants and tomatoes, cut sides down, on the preheated grill. Cook eggplant for 4 minutes, then flip and grill until tender, about 10 minutes more. Cook tomatoes until very tender, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer eggplant to a cutting board and tomatoes to a food processor.
Scrape eggplant pulp from the skins. Discard skins and place pulp in the food processor with tomatoes. Add tahini, parsley, and garlic; pulse until mostly smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer to a serving bowl. Top with feta cheese and sesame seeds.

Description: 
Grilled eggplant and tomatoes add a smoky flavor to this delicious spread. Use with focaccia or baguettes. I like to use Chinese eggplants--they're the sweetest.
