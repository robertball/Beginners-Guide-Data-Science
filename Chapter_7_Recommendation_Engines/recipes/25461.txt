Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon dried minced onion flakes
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon fines herbs
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large jar with a tight-fitting lid, mix the dry red wine, teriyaki sauce, honey, spicy brown mustard, dried minced onion flakes, garlic powder, fines herbs and ground black pepper. Seal the jar, and shake until the ingredients are well-mixed.
Place steak or beef tips in a resealable plastic bag. Pour dry red wine mixture into the bag. Place in the refrigerator and allow to marinate at least 8 hours, turning the bag occasionally, before grilling as desired.

Description: 
I created this over 20 years ago when I got tired of typical honey and teriyaki marinades. Red wine, brown mustard and herbs make this marinade unique. Play around with the ingredients to get the taste you want.
