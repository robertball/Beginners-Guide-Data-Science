Ingredients:
1/3 cup Smucker's速 Strawberry Preserves
1 (6 ounce) prepared graham cracker pie crust
1 (4-serving size) package vanilla cook & serve pudding mix
1 3/4 cups low-fat milk
1 cup Jif速 Natural Creamy Peanut Butter Spread, divided

Directions:
Whisk together pudding mix and milk in medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 5 minutes or until pudding comes to a boil, stirring every 2 minutes. Add 3/4 cup peanut butter, whisking until well blended. Pour into pie crust. Cover and chill at least 2 hours.
Stir preserves in a small bowl. Spoon onto pie, along inside edge of crust, creating a 1-inch wide border.
Place remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter in small resealable plastic bag. Microwave on HIGH 10 seconds to warm. Knead peanut butter. Cut a very small hole in bottom corner of plastic bag. Drizzle peanut butter across pie. Chill until serving.
