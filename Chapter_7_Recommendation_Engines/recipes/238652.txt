Description: 
This grown-up version of a root beer float is fun enough to drink in a fancy frosted glass with a curly straw. I prefer International Delight® Cold Stone Creamery Sweet Cream or Dunkin Donuts® Extra Extra Sweet flavor. I used a store brand root beer and the least expensive coconut rum my store had at the time.
