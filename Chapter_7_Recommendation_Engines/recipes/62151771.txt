4 eggs
1 1/4 cups cocoa powder
1 cup flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Melt butter/margarine. Cool slightly then stir in sugar and vanilla. Add eggs one at a time, beat well. Add cocoa and beat. Add flour, baking powder and salt and beat again. Stir in nuts (optional). Place about 1/2 of the batter into a lined muffin tin. Put 1 mini Reese's peanut butter cup on top of each. Top with another spoonful of the chocolate batter until each is about 2/3 full (make sure the Reese's is covered). Bake for 15-20 minutes. The time varies depending on the oven.
