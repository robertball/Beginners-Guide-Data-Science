Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
2 cups white chocolate chips
3/4 cup chopped almonds
3/4 cup dried apricots, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Stir in the dry ingredients until well blended, then stir in the white chips, almonds, and apricots.
Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
These are THE BEST cookies I ever made!  They are a great hit with my family and friends. One variation is to add 1 cup of walnuts and 3/4 cup of dried cranberries in place of the apricots and almonds.
