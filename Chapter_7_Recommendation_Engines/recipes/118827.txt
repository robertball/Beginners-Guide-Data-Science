Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/4 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour

GLAZE:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs, sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, baking powder and baking soda; gradually add to creamed mixture. Spread into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with raspberries and blueberries. Bake at 325 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
For glaze, in a mixing bowl, beat confectioners' sugar, butter, vanilla and enough milk to achieve drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm cake. Cool on a wire rack before cutting.
