Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 dash hot pepper sauce
3/4 pound (3/4 inch thick) boneless beef sirloin steak

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, sesame seeds, garlic, oil, brown sugar, pepper and hot pepper sauce. Pierce steak on both sides with a fork; place in the bag. Seal and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill the steak, covered, over medium heat for 7-9 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).

The first time I tried this recipe was years ago when we were going to my in-laws for a Mother's Day dinner. We've made a few adjustments to the original recipe, only improving on the great taste. -Paulette Barnett, Guelph, Ontario
