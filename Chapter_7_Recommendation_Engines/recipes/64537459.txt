Ingredients:
3 large egg whites (room temperature)
pinch Kosher salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 lemon (zested)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup sliced almonds (toasted until lightly browned and crushed, additional for garnish)
1 1/2 cups greek yogurt (for garnish)
1 cup strawberries (for garnish, sliced)
1 cup blackberries (for garnish)
1 cup blueberries (for garnish)
honey (drizzle for garnish)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225ÂºF. Line two baking sheet with a silicone liner or parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add egg whites and a pinch of salt. Whip until soft peaks form, then add sugar gradually, 1/3 at a time until all is incorporated. Add lemon zest, vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form. Fold in the almonds and transfer to a piping bag.
Pipe the meringue mixture into 4-inch rounds on baking sheet, in a spiral pattern leaving space between. Place on the top and bottom racks of the oven bake for 2 hours, rotating sheet trays halfway through. Check to see if meringues are completely dry, if not, turn oven off leaving meringues inside the oven until dry.
In a bowl, combine the berries.
To serve, layer a meringue disk with a dollop of greek yogurt, top with berries and repeat to form two layers. Garnish with crushed almonds and honey.
Helpful Tip: top meringues with different ingredients, such as whipped cream, lemon curd and raspberries! Or top with your favorite seasonal fruit!
