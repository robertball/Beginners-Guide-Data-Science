Ingredients:
6 ears corn, shucked with stems intact
1/2 cup Japanese mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon Mexican seasoning, or to taste
1 (12 ounce) package crumbled cotija cheese
6 tablespoons okonomiyaki sauce (such as OtaJoy®), or to taste
1/4 cup aonori seaweed flakes, or to taste
1 tablespoon bonito flakes, or to taste
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Heat a large grill pan over medium-high heat.
Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and Mexican seasoning in a bowl and stir until blended.
Grill corn in the preheated grill pan until warm yellow in color and grill marks form, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, about 6 minutes total. Set aside to cool.
Use a pastry brush to coat grilled corn with the mayonnaise mixture. Sprinkle cotija cheese on the corn, rotating to cover all sides. Drizzle okonomiyaki sauce evenly over corn. Sprinkle aonori flakes on top and add bonito flakes.
