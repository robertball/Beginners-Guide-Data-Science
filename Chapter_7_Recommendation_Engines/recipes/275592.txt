Ingredients:
Marinade:
1 tablespoon cooking sherry
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
Sauce:
1/2 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon garlic chile paste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
3 tablespoons oil, divided
1/2 cup dried red chile peppers
1 teaspoon freshly cracked pepper
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 scallions, sliced, white and green parts separated
1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts (optional)
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Mix cooking sherry, soy sauce, cornstarch, salt and pepper for the marinade in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and set aside to marinate.
Combine chicken stock, chile paste, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and cornstarch for the sauce in a bowl. Stir until well combined, add sesame seeds, and set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chile peppers and cook until they turn dark red, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry chicken pieces until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add cracked pepper, ginger, garlic, salt, white parts of scallions, and peanuts. Fry an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Add reserved chiles and sauce. Cook and stir until mixture has thickened or desired consistency is reached, about 5 minutes. Garnish with additional sesame seeds and green parts of scallions.

Description: 
This is similar to Kung Pao Chicken, especially if you add the optional peanuts. You can control the spiciness of this dish by the number of chile peppers you add. I like it spicy so I add extra chile peppers.
