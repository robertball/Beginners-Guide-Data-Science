Ingredients:
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup cornmeal
2 teaspoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (e.g., Splenda Â®)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 egg whites
2 tablespoons plain nonfat yogurt
2 tablespoons skim milk
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oats, cornmeal, sweetener, salt, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, yogurt, milk and water. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and mix just until moistened.
Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour about 1/3 cup of batter per pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to form in the center, then flip and cook until browned on the other side.
his is a wonderful starter recipe!! thank you so much!! yes, it needs a little more liquid but that is up to the cook, we all know what the batter needs to look like! I didn't use cornmeal.. don't like the grittyness of it. Instead I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup oat bran and 1/4 cup white flour. I also added sugar instead of Splenda(don't like poison). The egg whites made it extra healthy! this is great! my kids are gobbling them up as I type

Description: 
Easy, satisfying, and full of whole grain goodness! Top as desired- I like mine with peanut butter and sugar-free syrup. Also, any chopped fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips could be added to the batter.Modified from: Multigrain Pancakes
