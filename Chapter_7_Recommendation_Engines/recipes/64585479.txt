Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/3 cup water
1/2 cup vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 lbs. meaty pork spareribs, cut in 2-3 rib sections
1 onion, chopped

Directions:
Mix brown sugar and flour in a large saucepan. Add the water, then vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ketchup, tomato paste, honey, Dijon mustard, ginger, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir over medium heat until boiling. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until the sauce is thickened.
Layer the ribs with the chopped onions in a 4-6 quart crockpot, spooning sauce over each layer.
Cover the slow cooker and cook on Low for 10-12 hours or on High for 5-6 hours until ribs are very tender and glazed.
At this point you can remove the ribs and place them on a broiler pan. Brush with some of the glaze from the slow cooker and brown under the broiler until dark brown. While the ribs are browning, put some of the sauce in a small saucepan and boil until thickened and reduced. Serve this with the ribs.
