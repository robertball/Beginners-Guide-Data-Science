Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup diced, pitted dates
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture. Fold in oats and dates. Cover and chill dough for at least one hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.
Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten each cookie with a large fork.
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
My family loves these oatmeal cookies, and with my made-over version, they are a great way to sneak extra fiber and grains into their diet! I reduce the sugar, add whole wheat, use rolled oats and add dates (for extra fiber!)
