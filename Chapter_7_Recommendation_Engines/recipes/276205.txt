Ingredients:
1 small red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 small red onion, finely chopped
4 green onions, finely chopped
2 pounds ground chicken
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 egg
1 tablespoon Jamaican jerk seasoning
1 tablespoon minced garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can sliced peaches, with juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x5-inch loaf pan.
Combine red bell pepper, red onion, and green onions in a bowl. Transfer 1/2 of the mixture to another bowl and add ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, jerk seasoning, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix well. Mix in 1/4 cup peach juice from can. Shape mixture into a loaf, place into the prepared pan, and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover meatloaf and bake 25 minutes more.
Chop peaches and measure 1 cup into a bowl and add remaining bell pepper mixture. Remove meatloaf from the oven, leaving heat on, and spoon peach mixture on top. Return to the oven and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
