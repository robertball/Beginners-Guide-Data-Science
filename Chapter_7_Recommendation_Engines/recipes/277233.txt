Ingredients:
1/4 cup dry white wine
12 firm, ripe Seckel pears
1 cup whole almonds
1/2 cup dried figs, chopped
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon gingerbread spice mix
4 cups whipped cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour wine into a baking dish.
Core pears carefully using an apple corer.
Toast almonds in an ungreased pan over medium-low heat until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool.
Combine almonds, figs, honey, and gingerbread spice in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until smooth, scraping down the sides of the food processor as needed. Spoon the stuffing into the pears and place them in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is browned and the pears are soft but not falling apart, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm with whipped cream.

Description: 
Seckel pears are ideal for this recipe because they are small and still firm even when they are fairly ripe. For the stuffing, I like to combine almonds with figs, or walnuts with prunes, but any other combination is good too. If you use larger pears, you will need to double the stuffing.
