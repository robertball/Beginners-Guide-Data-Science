Description: 
A delicious rub for baby back pork ribs! Makes enough rub for 6 racks of ribs. Ground rosemary is almost impossible to find in stores. I grind up dried rosemary leaves in a molcajete, with a mortar and pestle, or a clean coffee grinder. Trust me, it's worth the few extra minutes it takes!
