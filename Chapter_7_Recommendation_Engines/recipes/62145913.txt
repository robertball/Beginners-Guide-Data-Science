Description: 
Not having all the ingredients on hand for many of the cheese ball recipes on this site, I raided my fridge and came up with this version of a classic cheese ball with some underlying Italian flavors. Serve with hearty crackers. Can be made a day ahead, and keeps well in the refrigerator for a week.
