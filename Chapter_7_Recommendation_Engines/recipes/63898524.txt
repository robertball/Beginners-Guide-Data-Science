Ingredients:
4 Salmon fillets about 3-4 oz each
1 tbsp. fresh dill, stems removed, finely minced
2 cloves garlic finely minced
4 tbsp unsalted butter
3 tbsp flour
1 cup dry white wine
1 pod - Knorr Homestyle Stock Chicken Concentrate
1 cup water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Coat the salmon with a dusting of salt and black pepper. Pre heat grill for medium heat. Place salmon on foil pan and set on outdoor grill grates.  Cook for approximately 12 -15 minutes, do not flip.  Cook until fish begins to flake with a fork.
While fish is cooking make the sauce:
Place the Knorr pod in a microwave safe bowl with the water and heat for 2 minutes.  Stir to disolve pod.
Place butter in large saute pan with the garlic.  Cook for a few minutes or until garlic is golden.  Add flour and whisk until thickened.
Add wine and while whisking add the broth.   Add the dill and bring sauce to a simmer.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Continue to whisk.  Sauce is ready when it has thickened and reduced enough to heavily coat the back of a spoon.
Spoon over salmon and serve immediately.
