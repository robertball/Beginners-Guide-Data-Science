Description: 
MY GRANDMOTHER first made this cake, and my mother made it often when I was a little girl. Today, at age 82, I'm still baking it. What better testimony to a delicious recipe!    You can frost it or just sprinkle it with a little powdered sugar. Either way, it's great. -Dorothy Colli, West Hartford, Connecticut
