Low Carb Meatloaf Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 lbs. extra lean ground beef
8 oz can of tomato sauce
3 T soy sauce
1 T onion powder
1 T dried parsley
ground black pepper to taste
4 cloves of garlic, minced
2 whole eggs
1/2 c Parmesan cheese (you want the powdery kind, like Kraft in a can, not shreds. This is the binder).
1 piece of raw bacon cut up as fine as you can

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix everything together in a bowl. I use my hands. Mush it all up good.
Put the mixture into a casserole dish. Smooth the top a bit. Bake uncovered for 1 hour 10 minutes. I checked mine in the center with a meat thermometer (160+). Take it out of the oven and CAREFULLY pour off the fat.
