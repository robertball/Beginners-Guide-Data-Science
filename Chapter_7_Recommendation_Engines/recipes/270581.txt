Ingredients:
2 cups whole almonds
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread almonds onto a baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven until nuts start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine vinegar and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Gently stir until sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove toasted almonds from the oven, add to saucepan, and stir to coat.
Line the baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread coated almonds evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle salt over almonds, tossing to cover evenly. Allow to dry, about 10 minutes.
