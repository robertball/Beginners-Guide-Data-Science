Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 (8 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
2 tomatoes, diced
1 large cucumber, diced
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse pasta with cold water. Transfer to a large bowl.
Add kidney beans, tomatoes, cucumber, and olives to the cold pasta; mix to combine. Pour salad dressing over mixture, and gently stir until incorporated.
