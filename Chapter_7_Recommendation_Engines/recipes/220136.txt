Ingredients:
15 small heart-shaped baking molds
2 teaspoons butter
1 (19.8 ounce) package chocolate chunk brownie mix
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons water
1 egg
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1/4 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Butter the heart-shaped molds.
Beat brownie mix, vegetable oil, water, and 1 egg together in a bowl until smooth and well mixed.
Pour the batter into the prepared heart molds.
Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Beat in 1 egg until smooth.
Spoon a dollop of the cream cheese mixture into each heart mold and mix slightly with a knife to make decorative swirls of cream cheese filling in the brownie batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
While brownies are baking, place chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring after each time, until the chocolate is warm, smooth, and melted.
Stir heavy cream into the chocolate. Mixture will be clumpy.
Remove hearts from oven, and immediately spread about 1 tablespoon of chocolate mixture over each heart.
Return the hearts to the oven and bake until the chocolate topping spreads out, about 5 minutes. Cool before serving.
