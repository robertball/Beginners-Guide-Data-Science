Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1 1/2 tsp. almond extract
1 1/2 Tbs. milk
2  1/4 cups AP flour, sifted
1/4 tsp. salt
3/4 - 1 cup pecans, finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a medium bowl, cream together butter and powdered sugar. Add almond extract,  milk, and combine.
In separate bowl, mix flour, salt and pecans. Add this to butter mixture, and stir until dough comes together in a cohesive ball.
Gently roll about 1 Tbs. of dough to form a small ball, and place 1 1/2" apart on INVERTED parchment lined cookie sheet.
Bake 15" -  18", or until bottoms turn golden; tops will remain soft.
Remove pan from oven, pull parchment on to wire cooling rack, and allow to cool. Roll cookies in powdered sugar to serve.
Notes:
Sifting the flour and powdered sugar ensure the cookies with be light and airy.
I use my stand mixer most often, but have also made them by hand. The results are the same.
Place parchment paper on an inverted cookie sheet so you can pull the sheet of cookies directly on to the wire rack to cool, in one movement. It works well for me.
No need to place dough more than about  1 1/2" apart as they should not spread. I get one batch per cookie sheet.
Put powdered sugar in a reseal-able bag to roll them. Less mess/easier clean up.
