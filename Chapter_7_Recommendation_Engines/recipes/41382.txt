Description: 
A vodka martini with a bit of a twist and kick. Ideally, you should have chilled martini glasses ahead of time, as this removes the need to chill the glasses when you prepare. Store the vodka in the freezer as well. If your glass and vodka are not chilled, you can make this drink in a cocktail shaker. Don't shake for too long - the vodka will become watery.
