Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon, skins removed
4 tablespoons prepared Dijon-style mustard
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 cup butter, melted
4 lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a shallow baking pan with aluminum foil.
Melt butter in microwave.  Mix in breadcrumbs and italian seasoning to create a paste.
Place salmon skin-side down on foil. Spread a thin layer of mustard on the top of each fillet, and season with salt and pepper. Top with bread crumb mixture.
Bake in a preheated oven for 13 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily with a fork.  Turn oven to broil and cook for another 2 minutes to brown the breadcrumb topping.
Serve with lemon wedges.
