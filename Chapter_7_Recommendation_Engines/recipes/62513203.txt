The Best Meatballs Recipe

Ingredients:
1.5 pound ground beef
.5 pound ground veal
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs
.5 cups onion, minced
1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons Italian Seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
1 cup olive oil

Directions:
Combine beef and veal in a large bowl. Add garlic, onion, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.
Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)
Place cooked meatballs into Marinara Sauce and cook for 15 more minutes.
