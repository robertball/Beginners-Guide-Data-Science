Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 medium eggplant, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch slices
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup instant mashed potato flakes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt butter in a shallow baking dish in the oven while it is preheating.
In a small bowl, mix together the egg, salt and pepper. Dip slices of eggplant into the egg mixture, then dip into the potato flakes to coat.  Place the coated slices of eggplant into the hot buttered dish.
Bake for about 20 minutes, or until tender, turning once after 10 minutes.

Description: 
Eggplant is battered and breaded with instant mashed potato flakes then browned in the oven until tender. Since I tried this method, we never serve eggplant any other way.
