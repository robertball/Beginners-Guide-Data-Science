Ingredients:
20 ounces frozen pierogies
1/4 cup butter
1/2 head cabbage, sliced
1 onion, halved and thinly sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
12 ounces kielbasa sausage, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 cup beef broth

Directions:
Bring a large shallow pot of water to a boil and drop in frozen pierogies. Boil over medium heat until pierogies float to the top, about 5 minutes; drain and set aside.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir cabbage and onion until cabbage is wilted, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper and stir in kielbasa pieces; cook until sausage is heated through, another 5 minutes.
Gently lay pierogies into the skillet and move sausage mixture aside to allow pierogies to cook on the surface of the hot skillet until they puff up and brown slightly on the bottom, about 20 minutes. Pour in broth and reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until cabbage is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
