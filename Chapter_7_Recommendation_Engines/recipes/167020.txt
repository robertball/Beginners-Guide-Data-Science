Ingredients:
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 orange tomato, cubed
1/2 red onion, diced
salt to taste
16 pods fresh okra

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate. Combine the vinegar, tomato, onion, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
Cook the okra on the preheated grill until a few black areas have developed on its skin, about 5 minutes. Toss the okra with the tomato mixture, and serve.
