Ingredients:
1 box cinnamon cereal, finely crushed
10 Tbsp butter, melted
1/2 cup cinnamon-sugar mixture

1 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 Tbsp vanilla
1 (8 oz.) tub whipped topping
1 1/2 cups cinnamon chips

Directions:
grease a 7" x 11'  baking dish. In a large bowl, combine  cinnamon cereal crumbs, melted butter and 1/4 cup of the cinnamon-sugar mixture together, stirring until well mixed. Press half of this mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
In a stand mixer, beat together Neufchâtel cheese, sweetened condensed milk and vanilla until smooth. Fold in whipped cream and cinnamon chips. Spread mixture on top of the crust.
Top with remaining crust, sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 8 hours. To serve, slice into squares.

Description: 
This is similar to a  gloriously cinnamon-ey Snickerdoodle Crunch Cake. A quick and easy no-bake dessert, spiked with cinnamon, cinnamon and more cinnamon! If you really feel the need, top with additional caramel topping.
