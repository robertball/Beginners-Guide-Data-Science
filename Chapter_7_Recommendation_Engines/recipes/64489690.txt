Ingredients:
1/4c unsweetened applesauce
2T chia seeds
1/2c date paste
1 tsp. vanilla
2 ripe/overripe bananas, mashed well
1/2c golden raisins
2T fine chopped walnuts
1c rolled oats
1/2c unbleached flour (you can sub with flour of choice here)
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt (optional)

Directions:
In a separate bowl, combine the applesauce, chia seeds, date paste and vanilla and bananas, mix until smooth.  Set aside so the chia seeds can start to gel.  (About 10 minutes)
In a large bowl combine the raisins, walnuts and the dry ingredients.  After 10 minutes, combine the wet ingredients into the dry.  Mix very well with a wooden spoon.
With an ice cream scoop, scoop the cookies onto the baking sheet.  I was able to fit 6 at a time.  With an offset spatula or a knife, flatten the cookies to your desired thickness.  The thicker they are, the chewier they will be.
Place in oven for 23-25 minutes.  The edges should just be getting golden.
Remove from oven and let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes before moving to a cooling rack.
Let cool completely before eating.  These can be stored in an air tight container or in bags and frozen.
