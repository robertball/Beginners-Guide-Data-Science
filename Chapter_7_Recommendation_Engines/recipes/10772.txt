Description: 
We had a cooking class at Children's Hospital in Orange, CA.  These were a favorite for the patients and adults.  You should have been there to smell the wonderful scent of cookies right out of the oven and see the children's faces!!!  I think these are called martian cookies because of the green flecks, and they are out of this world!!
