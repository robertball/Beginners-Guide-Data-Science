Ingredients:
Use canned plain tomato sauce, not pasta sauce, in this recipe.
2	teaspoons  vegetable oil
2	tablespoons  chili powder
1 1/2	teaspoons  ground cumin
1	cup  leftover Tomato Gravy , plus 3 leftover Swiss Steaks (see related recipe), shredded into bite-sized pieces
2/3	cup  canned plain tomato sauce  (see note)
1 1/2	cups  shredded pepper Jack cheese
2	tablespoons  chopped fresh cilantro
1	(16-ounce) can  pinto beans , drained and rinsed
8	(6-inch)  corn tortillas

Directions:
1. MAKE SAUCE Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Cook chili powder and cumin until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in Tomato Gravy and tomato sauce and simmer until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes.
2. ASSEMBLE ENCHILADAS Combine Swiss Steaks, 2 tablespoons sauce, 1 cup cheese, cilantro, and beans in large bowl. Spread additional Â½ cup sauce in 8-inch square baking dish. Stack tortillas on plate and microwave, covered, until softened, about 1 minute. One at a time, place heaping 1/3 cup beef mixture in center of each tortilla, roll tightly, and arrange seam-side down in prepared baking dish.
3. TOP AND BAKE Pour remaining sauce evenly over enchiladas, top with remaining cheese, and cover with foil. Bake until enchiladas are heated through, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese is lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve.

Description: 
Leftovers that are completely different from the original recipe hardly seem like leftovers at all. We took a hard look at our Swiss steak recipe to see if we could spice it up a bit.
