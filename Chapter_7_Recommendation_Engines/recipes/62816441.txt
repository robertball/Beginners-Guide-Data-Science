Description: 
Beans, which are naturally low in fat, are packed with vitamins and minerals such as calcium, fiber, iron, potassium and protein. Studies have shown that they can help reduce cholesterol and stabilize blood pressure, and even help prevent cancer and heart disease! Aside from the health facts, there is something about beans and veggies mixed with cilantro and a refreshing dressing that leaves me craving more. Also known as “Mexican Caviar,” this dish is perfect for spring and summer picnics.
