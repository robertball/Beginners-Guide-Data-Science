Ingredients:
2 TBL salt
2 Lobsters
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Lobster meat deteriorates quickly after being cooked, therefore the lobster must be kept alive until they are cooked.  Place the lobsters in the freezer for about 10 minutes before cooking to numb them.
Add salt to a large stockpot that is filled half way with water.
Bring the water to a full rolling boil and plunge the lobsters headfirst into the pot.
Cover the lid tightly.  When the pot returns to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and cook for approximately 15 minutes or until shells turn a bright red.

I love the pure the deliciousness of lobster.  Why would you try to mask it with condiments?
