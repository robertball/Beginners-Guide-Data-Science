Ingredients:
1lb/500g Chicken Breast or Minute/Cube Steak - cut into thin strips;
1 Onion chopped;
½ Green Pepper - chopped;
½ Red Pepper - chopped;
Handful of fresh Coriander (Cilantro) - torn;
2 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil;
12 Flour Tortillas (Can cheat and buy a packet);
125g carton Sour Cream.
Marinade.
3 or 4 cloves Garlic - finely chopped;
6 tbsp Red Wine;
3 tbsp Worcestershire Sauce;
1tsp dried Oregano;
½ tsp ground Cumin;
½ tsp Sugar;
150ml Fresh Lime Juice;
80ml Tequilla (optional);
1 Green/Red Chilli – Seeds removed or to taste for heat - finely chopped (optional);
{I tend not to use the chilli or very little as the marinade is spicy on its own BUT others like it HOT}.

Directions:
Mix all marinade together, add meat, cover and marinade in fridge min 1 to 2 hours or overnight if possible;
Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the onions and sautee on med/low heat for 5 minutes or so or until soft but not coloured;
Add peppers, most of the coriander, meat and as much marinade you wish;
Sautee until ready, about 5 to 8 minutes;
Serve in dish and garnish with rest of coriander, accompanied by hot tortilla wraps and sour cream.
