Ingredients:
2 cups fresh cranberries
2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons water, or more as needed
1 large Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and chopped
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 cup fresh orange juice
1/4 cup pecans (optional)
1 cup golden raisins
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pinch salt, or to taste

Directions:
Place the cranberries, sugar, and water in a large saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and cook until all the cranberries have popped, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the apple, celery, orange zest, orange juice, pecans, raisins, ginger, cloves, and salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the celery is tender and the sauce is reduced, about 35 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the saucepan, and let the chutney stand to thicken, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
The combination of fresh cranberries, Granny Smith apples, and spices makes for a lovely alternative to regular cranberry sauce. It is divine served over baked brie. This recipe has yielded many compliments, as I have given it as Christmas gifts in pretty jars or served at Thanksgiving dinner.
