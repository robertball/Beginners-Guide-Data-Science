Ingredients:
1 Tin cup (camp coffee size) of bread flour or wheat flour
1 tsp White Sugar
1 ½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
1 Tin cup of sourdough starter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F and set baking tin or pie plate in warm area on stove top or prepare your dutch oven for use. Place butter nearby in a small container to warm as well.
Mix the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl then make a bowl in the middle of this to pour the sourdough starter into.
Mix until dough starts to form. Move dough onto floured suface like a cutting board and kneed no more than 10 times sprinkling small amounts of flour on top to keep it off the hands.
Grease your baking pan. I use a small amount of bacon grease on my fingers.
Roll to 1/2 inch thick with whatever you have handy (rolling pin, straight wine bottle, full beer can!!). Cut rounds with a greased tin cup. Set these in the baking pan very close together. Let these set in a warm area to rise for up to 10 minutes but at least 5 minutes.
Brush tops with butter and bake until golden; approx 18 min, then brush again when removed.
