Ingredients:
1-1/2 lbs. lean ground beef (or venison)
1/2 lb. ground pork
1 large onion, chopped
1 bell pepper, chopped
1 tsp. minced garlic
1 (15 oz) can Bush chili beans
1 (15 oz) can pinto beans, rinsed & drained
1 (15 oz) can dark red kidney beans, rinsed & drained
1 (10 oz) can Rotel tomatoes
1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes
1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce
2 Tbsp. chili powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. salt (or to taste)
1/2 tsp. black pepper (or to taste)

Directions:
In a 3-4 quart Dutch oven sprayed with Pam, brown the ground beef and pork together over medium heat.
While the meat is browning, chop the onion and bell pepper.
Add the garlic, chopped onion and bell pepper to the meat mixture.  Continue cooking until the vegetables are wilted and the meat is fully cooked.
Add seasonings (chili powder, ground cumin, salt and pepper) and stir well into the meat mixture.
Add remaining ingredients.
Cover pot and simmer on low heat for 1 hour.
If desired, serve on a bed of Fritos corn chips and/or sprinkle with shredded Monterey-Jack cheese.

Description: 
For hunters who regularly ground pork into their venison meat, this chili is a super-fast dinner to make.  Young and old love it!  An easy recipe to alter and adapt to a crowd.  In the photo recipe, I had added a can of corn for eye-appeal (and the chili was still great), but corn is not a usual ingredient in this recipe.
