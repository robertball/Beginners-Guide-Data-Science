Ingredients:
1/2 pound butternut squash, cubed
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat bran
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground star anise
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup crushed pecans, or to taste
3 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread butternut squash over a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until soft, about 25 minutes. Remove and let cool. Leave oven on. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Combine white sugar, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, wheat bran, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, star anise, and allspice in a large bowl.
Mix milk, egg, and oil in another bowl. Mash cooled squash with a fork; mix into the milk mixture. Pour over flour mixture and fold until combined.
Scoop 1/3 of the batter into each muffin cup. Combine pecans and brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle over the muffins.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
