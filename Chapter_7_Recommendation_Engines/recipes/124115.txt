Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted
3/4 cup finely chopped ham
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and mustard. Combine egg, milk and butter; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in ham and cheese. Fill greased or paper-lined muffins cups about two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

Description: 
Despite the name, you don't have to be an early-riser to enjoy these hearty muffins (we often make them for brunch). My husband and children come running when they smell these buttery, tender muffins baking.
