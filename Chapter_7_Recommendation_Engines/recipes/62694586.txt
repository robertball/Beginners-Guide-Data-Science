Description: 
Living in Southern California my neighbors and I are always looking for ways to do all the cooking outside on the grill in hot summer months.  This is a simple potato side dish that compliments a power packed flavored meat or fish; The creaminess and subtle flavor of the potato won't compete with the main dish.
