Description: 
If you are a Clam lover, this recipe is for you. Every time I make this dish, primarily as a starter to a meal, it gets RAVE reviews. This is the first dish to go at a party or BBQ. Great starter for a surf & turf dinner, or a wonderful recipe for the Holidays. I love all year round and I make at least once a week. I have tried many variations with this simple sauce. Toss in chunks of Lobster, mussels,Scungelli and Shrimp for an authentic Zuppa De Pesce.
