Description: 
Great topping for tacos--also a nice side dish for any type of Mexican or Tex-Mex entree! Hint: The measurements are approximate- I usually make this without any.  You can use green or purple cabbage, or a combination of the two.  Same goes for green or red bell peppers.  For extra heat, use an additional jalapeno pepper.
