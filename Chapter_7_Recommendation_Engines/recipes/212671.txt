Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1/4 cup cashews
3 dried red chile peppers
2 tablespoons skinned split black lentils (urad dal)
1 tablespoon split Bengal gram (chana dal)
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 cup grated fresh coconut
4 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise
2 sprigs fresh curry leaves
1/4 teaspoon asafoetida powder
3 cups cold, cooked white rice
salt to taste
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Heat the coconut oil and ghee together in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cashews in the hot mixture until golden brown. Remove the cashews using a slotted spoon to a bowl; set aside. Add the red chile peppers, urad dal, chana dal, mustard seeds, and cumin seeds to the remaining oil. When the seeds begin to splutter, add the coconut, green chile peppers, curry leaves, and asafoetida powder; cook together for 1 minute before adding the rice. Season with salt. Stir the mixture, breaking the rice apart into individual grains with the back of the spoon; cook and stir until the rice is thoroughly reheated, 8 to 10 minutes. Garnish with the cashews and sesame seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature.
