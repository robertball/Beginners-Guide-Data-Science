Ingredients:
6 cups sugar
6 cups water
20 tsp instant coffee
1/2 gallon vodka
12 tsp vanilla (high quality)
vanilla bean (optional)

Directions:
Mix sugar, water and coffee together in a large pot and bring to a slow boil.
Simmer on low heat for 1 hour. Remove from heat, let cool slightly and cover with plastic wrap.
Let sit overnight (or for 12 hours.)
Remove plastic wrap (it will take any film off the top.)
Add vodka and vanilla, stir well.
Bottle and store in dark.
Note: All or part of a vanilla bean can be added to each bottle. I would suggest splitting the bean before adding since most of the flavor is inside the bean.

Description: 
For a Kahlua recipe overnight is pretty instant. Adding a vanilla bean and aging only enhances the flavor.
