salt
fresh grated black pepper, to taste
2 cups cooked chicken, cut into bite-size pieces

Set oven to 350 degrees.
Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.
In a saucepan, melt butter; whisk in flour and fresh garlic (if using), and whisk for 1 minute.

Cover, and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the rice is done, and the casserole is bubbly.
