2/3 cup warm milk
1 Tbsp olive oil
2/3 cup whole wheat flour

Knead for 10 minutes.  Place dough in ungreased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 hour.
Roll dough into a 1/4 inch rectangle.  Cut the dough into 1/2 inch strips.  Roll each strip in the palm of your hand to make a breadstick.  Lay on lightly greased baking sheets.
Beat the egg white and 2 tsp water together.  Brush onto breadsticks.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on rack.
