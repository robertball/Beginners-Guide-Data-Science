Ingredients:
4 cups water
1/2 cup basmati rice
1/2 cup split mung beans
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds

Directions:
Combine water, basmati rice, split mung beans, ginger, coriander, oregano, garlic, cumin, and fennel seeds in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, until most of the water is absorbed and the mixture has a smooth consistency, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Yummy, healthy, comfort food. This simple dish of beans and rice is tasty and helps cleanse the body and heal digestion for all body types. I also love this dish for an easy, healthy, pantry meal I can throw together when I have nothing else in the house. Top with ghee, salt, liquid aminos, or whatever you like. I like lemon pepper, sriracha sauce, and feta cheese.
