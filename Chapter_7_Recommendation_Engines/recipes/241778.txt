Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 large eggs
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), thawed
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 (16 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained, juice reserved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.
Beat cake mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until just combined. Increase speed to medium until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool in pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely, at least 2 hours.
Pour whipped topping into a bowl. Fold pudding mix into whipped topping, followed by drained crushed pineapple; fold gently until frosting is combined.
Place 1 cake on a cake plate or serving platter and poke cake several times with a fork. Spoon 1/2 of the reserved pineapple juice over cake. Cover top of cake layer with frosting, spreading to edges of cake.
Place remaining cake on top of frosted cake and poke top layer several times with a fork. Pour remaining pineapple juice over cake. Spread remaining frosting all over top and sides of cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
My mom used to make this when I was little. I haven't had it in years but made it recently to bring to a dinner party. It was a hit with the adults and the kids! For a slightly healthier option, substitute applesauce for 1/2 of the vegetable oil.
