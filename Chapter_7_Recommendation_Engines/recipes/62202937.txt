Ingredients:
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
4 cups chopped yellow onions (2 large)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups milk
5 10-ounce packages frozen chopped spinach, defrosted
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees
Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat.  Add onions and saute until translucent, about 15 minutes.  Add the flour and nutmeg and cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes.  Add the cream and milk and cook until thickened.
Squeeze as much liquid as possible from the spinach and add the spinach to the sauce.  Add 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese and mix well.  Season to taste with the salt and pepper.
Transfer the spinach to a baking dish and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan and the Gruyere on top.  Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until hot and
bubbly.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is by far, the most requested dish at all of our family gatherings.  It is my mom's secret recipe, and it is honestly the best spinach dish you will ever taste!  It is creamy on the inside and browned and crunchy on the top.  You can assemble the dish a day or two ahead, then bake before serving.
