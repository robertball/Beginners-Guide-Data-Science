Ingredients:
1 (7 ounce) pouch tuna in water, drained and juice reserved
3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
3 tablespoons finely chopped celery with leaves
1 large egg
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
2 slices day-old bread, cubed
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Mix drained tuna, onion, celery, egg, bread crumbs, bread cubes, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. If mixture is too dry to hold together, stir in reserved tuna juice, 1 teaspoon at a time. Divide mixture in fourths and shape each portion into a patty.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and pan-fry the patties until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain patties on paper towels.

Description: 
This is a meal on a bun. My Mother used to make this for us when time was limited or when meat wasn't allowed. You can serve it alone with rice and vegetables or on a bun with tomato and lettuce. Delicious and filling.
