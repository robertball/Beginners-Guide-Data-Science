Ingredients:
6 pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
2 tablespoons dry Italian seasoning
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 large onion, sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 pkg mushrooms
2 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Season pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder and seasoning, and then dredge in 1/2 cup flour.  In a skillet over medium heat, lightly brown chops in a small  amount of oil. Cook onion and mushrooms in same pan. Deglaze pan with a small amount of the chicken broth and add to slow cooker.
Place chops in slow cooker, and top with onions and mushrooms. Heat chicken broth and pour over chops.  Cover, and cook on Low 5-6 hours.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
After the chops have cooked, transfer chops to the oven to keep warm. Be careful, the chops are so tender they will fall apart. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour with the sour cream; mix into meat juices.  Turn slow cooker to High for 15 to 30 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened.  Serve sauce over pork chops.
