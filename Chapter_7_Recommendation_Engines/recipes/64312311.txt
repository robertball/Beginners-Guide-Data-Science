Ingredients:
1 spray(s) cooking spray to coat skillet
2 teaspoon vegetable oil spread, butter-flavored
1/2 cup(s) onion(s) sliced
1/2 cup(s) pepper(s), red, bell sliced
1/2 cup(s) zucchini sliced
1/2 cup tomato(es), diced
1 tablespoon basil, fresh chopped
1 pinch pepper, black ground
1/2 cup(s) egg substitute
1/2 cup(s) cottage cheese, 1% fat
1/4 cup(s) milk, fat-free evaporated
1/4 cup(s) cheese, reduced-fat Monterey Jack shredded

Directions:
Coat an ovenproof 10" skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-low heat until hot. Melt the vegetable oil spread in the skillet. Add the onion, bell pepper, and zucchini and cook, stirring, over medium-low heat until the vegetables are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, and black pepper to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook until the flavors are blended, 2 to 3 minutes, and remove from the heat.
Preheat the broiler. In a blender, combine the egg substitute, cottage cheese, and milk and process until smooth. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the bottom is set and the top is still slightly wet.
Transfer the skillet to the broiler and broil until the top is set, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the cheese and broil until the cheese melts.
