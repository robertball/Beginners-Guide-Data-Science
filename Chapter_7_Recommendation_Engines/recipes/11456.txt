Ingredients:
7 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped, divided
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, divided
10 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup half-and-half
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat 6 ounces chocolate in heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until melted. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and half-and-half.
Scoop into 1-inch balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Freeze until set, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt remaining chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, about 1 minute. Add remaining powdered sugar and butter. Mix in vanilla extract.
Work in flour and salt until dough holds together. Mold portions of dough around frozen chocolate balls to form 1- 1/2-inch balls. Place about 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until set but not browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet. Cool completely on a wire rack.

These are fabulous!  I have no idea where I got this recipe from, but we've been baking them for years! When the cookies are done, dip the tops into chocolate icing.
