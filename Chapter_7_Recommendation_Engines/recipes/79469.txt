Description: 
What's the best diet? No question, according to dozens of recent studies: The Mediterranean diet wins, hands down. Why is the Med diet so good for you? Top reasons: high antioxidants and fiber in plant foods; good fat in olive oil and fish; and less bad fat, less iron and fewer carcinogens (from eating fewer animal foods).
