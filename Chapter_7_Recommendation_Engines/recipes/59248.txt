Ingredients:
1 ½ cups raisins
4 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
4 cups white sugar
1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ teaspoons nutmeg

1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:




Submitter: 
MIDNITEJASMINE
Description: 
This is my lower fat version of a pumpkin bread recipe using extra pumpkin and no oil. You can also substitute artificial sweetener for half of the sugar, and some whole wheat flour for nutrition, and they still taste great. They freeze very well; just microwave a frozen muffin for 20 to 30 seconds and it's ready.
