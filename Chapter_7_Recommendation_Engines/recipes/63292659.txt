Ingredients:
1 lb. Lump Crab Meat
2 Slices White Bread, crumbled, crust removed (I processed mine in a food processor)
1 Egg, beaten
2 tbsp. Mayo
1 tsp Seafood Seasoning (such as Old Bay Seasoning)
1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce
1 tsp. Dijon Mustard
1 tbsp. Dried Parley Flakes (I used freshly chopped cilantro, instead)
2 tsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except the crab meat in a bowl. Gently fold in crab meat and chill for one hour before forming into three ounce cakes.
Saute over medium heat for 2-3 minutes per side.
