Ingredients:
2 cups almond milk
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
5 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons coconut sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1/4 cup toasted chopped pecans

Directions:
Combine almond milk and vinegar together in a measuring cup; set aside for 10 minutes.
Combine water and flaxseed meal together in a bowl; allow to rest until gelatinous, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
Add almond milk mixture, flaxseed meal mixture, pumpkin puree, and coconut oil to the bowl with the flour mixture. Mix until well blended. Fold in pecans.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
