Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 potatoes, peeled and cubed
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
22 ounces sauerkraut, drained

Directions:
Combine 3 cups flour, baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, egg and warm water in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix well.
Knead the dough, adding flour until the dough in stiff and hard to work with, let the dough rest.
Roll dough into a 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide cylinder.
Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Using scissors cut dough in 1/2 to 3/4 inch pieces into the boiling water. The dumplings will sit on the bottom of the pot until almost done. When almost finished cooking, the knoephla will rise to the surface. Once they have risen to the surface let them cook 2 minutes longer. Drain well.
Place oil in a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Fry until potatoes are cooked through and golden brown.
While potatoes are frying, place 1 tablespoon butter in a non-stick skillet, heat over medium-high heat. Cook the kneophla in batches, transferring the fried dumplings into the skillet with the potatoes.
When all of the knoephla and potatoes are nicely browned and combined in one skillet, add the sauerkraut to the mixture and heat through. Serve immediately.
