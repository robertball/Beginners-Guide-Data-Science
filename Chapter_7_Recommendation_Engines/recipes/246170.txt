Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 (16 ounce) package uncooked angel hair pasta, broken into 1-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups instant rice
1 cup milk
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons chopped onion
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 slices shredded smoked Gouda cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add pasta; cook and stir until evenly-browned, about 3 minutes.
