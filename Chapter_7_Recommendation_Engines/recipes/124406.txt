Description: 
Cranberry Bread is a natural coming from Oregon, a state famous for its cranberries.    And each fall my husband and I go out and scrounge around picking up the walnuts for this delicious bread.    A lady was presenting this bread at a food fair when I had the 'nerve' to ask her for the recipe. She obliged, and it's been a steady item in our menu ever since.    But not just at Thanksgiving--heavens, no! I freeze the berries and have a ready supply all year long.
