Ingredients:
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup water
1 cup raisins
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
1 pinch salt
2 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the 1/3 cup of sugar, water, raisins, butter and pinch of salt. Bring ingredients to a boil, and cook until thick, you should be able to see the bottom of the pan while stirring when finished. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sift together the flour, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, salt and baking powder, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream shortening and sugar until smooth. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Add dry ingredients, mix until blended, then finally stir in the milk.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 2 1/2 inch circles. Place a teaspoon of filling onto the center of half of the cookies. Cover with the other half of the cookies. Press the edges together with the tines of a fork. Sprinkle with sugar and bake on unprepared cookie sheets for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven.
