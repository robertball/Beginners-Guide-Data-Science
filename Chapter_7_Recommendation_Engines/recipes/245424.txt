Description: 
I was introduced to this Middle Eastern dish by one of my best friends, who is Palestinian. His mother made this once a week at her deli and after trying it once I had a standing order to save me a plate every week. This is so healthy and delicious, and it's so simple to make. After she retired and closed her deli I had to search through several recipes and make my adjustments to get it to my liking. It has become a staple in my home.
