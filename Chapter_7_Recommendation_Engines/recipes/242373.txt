Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1/4 cup light brown sugar
3 tablespoons sea salt
4 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
4 1/2 teaspoons dried lemon peel
4 1/2 teaspoons paprika
4 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons black pepper
Sauce:
1 cup seedless raspberry jam
1/4 cup chipotle salsa
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon hickory liquid smoke
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 racks Smithfield® Extra Tender Pork Back Ribs, membrane removed
Handful hickory or apple wood chips for smoking, soaked in water and drained (optional)
3/4 cup tamarind juice, in a spray bottle*

Directions:
About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all ingredients in small bowl; mix well.   Pat ribs dry with paper towels; generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate.
Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.
Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours.  Spray both sides of ribs with tamarind juice.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.
Continue cooking ribs for 1 to 2 hours more until very tender, spraying with tamarind juice every 30 minutes.  Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.
Move ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until sauce is set.  Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.
Serve ribs with remaining sauce.
