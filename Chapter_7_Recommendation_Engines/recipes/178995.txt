Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 pounds boneless beef sirloin steak or top round steak, cut into strips
2 tablespoons chopped onions
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
3 cups cut-up mushrooms (white, shiitake, portobello)
1 3/4 cups Swanson® Beef Broth (Regular, 50% Less Sodium or Certified Organic)
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Hot cooked egg noodles
freshly ground black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook in batches until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion, garlic, parsley and mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are tender. Remove the beef mixture from the skillet.  Stir the broth and wine in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium.
Stir the sour cream and flour in a small bowl. Add the sour cream mixture to the skillet.  Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Return the beef mixture to the skillet and cook until hot. Serve over the noodles with the black pepper, if desired.
