Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 lemons, juiced
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup vermouth
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Combine the flour and salt on a plate, then gently press the chicken breasts into the flour mixture to coat. Shake off the excess flour. Arrange the chicken in the skillet and cook until browned on each side, about 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice, chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce, vermouth, garlic, bay leaf, and basil. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Stir in the artichoke hearts, and continue simmering until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more.
Mix the cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Stir the mixture into the chicken, and continue cooking until thickened, about 5 minutes.
