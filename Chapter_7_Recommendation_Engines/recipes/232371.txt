Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
5 tablespoons butter, cut into chunks
2/3 cup milk
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup shredded coconut
Frosting:
1/4 cup butter, softened
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/4 cup shredded coconut, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Heat 5 tablespoons butter and milk together in a saucepan over low heat until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from  heat.
Beat white sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric hand mixer on low until mixture is smooth and thickened. Slowly pour flour mixture into sugar-egg mixture while mixing with the electric mixer until just incorporated. Slowly add butter-milk mixture; beat until just combined. Fold in 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Fill muffin cups with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Beat softened butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium. Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into creamed butter mixture on low until incorporated. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and lemon zest until smooth and creamy. Spread frosting over cooled cupcakes; sprinkle about 1 teaspoon shredded coconut onto each cupcake.

Description: 
This is a great cupcake recipe that I created. Lemon and coconut together is such a great combo. If you want, you can substitute lime zest for the lemon zest in the frosting, for lime coconut cupcakes instead. You can also add no zest at all to make regular coconut cupcakes.
