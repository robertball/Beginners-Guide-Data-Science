Ingredients:
1 pound baby Yukon Gold potatoes
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
1 cup chopped kale
1 cup chopped cabbage
1/2 onion, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
4 ounces firm tofu, crumbled
1 tablespoon soy sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain in a colander.
Warm 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil on a griddle or in a saute pan. Add potatoes and carefully smash each potato to about 1/2-inch thickness using the back of a spatula. Sear potatoes on each side until crispy, about 3 minutes. Season with pepper and transfer to a large bowl.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat in a saute pan. Add kale, cabbage, onion, and bell pepper and saute for about 3 minutes. Crumble tofu over the top of the vegetables. Pour in soy sauce and continue cooking until any liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl with the smashed potatoes. Mix and serve.
