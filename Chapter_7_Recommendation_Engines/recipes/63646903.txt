Ingredients:
1 can chick-peas (drained and rinsed)
3 tablespoons tahini
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup warm water
1 large head of garlic
juice of one lemon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
dash of cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Cut off the very top of the garlic clove (about 1/4") so that the tops of the cloves are exposed slightly.  Coat with a little olive oil and wrap securely in foil.  Roast the garlic in oven for 1 hour.  Remove and allow to cool.
Once cool, squeeze the soft, roasted garlic out of each clove into the food processor or blender.  Add all other ingredients and process/blend until completely smooth.
Scrape ingredients off sides of food processor/blender to make sure it blends evenly.  If the hummus is too thick you can add additional olive oil or water a tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency.
Optional: Drizzle a little olive oil over and sprinkle with paprika before serving.
