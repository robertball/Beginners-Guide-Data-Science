2 (27 oz.) cans chunky style spaghetti sauce
2 (27 oz.) cans water
1 tsp. beef bouillon crystals
1 tsp. chicken bouillon crystals
8 oz. dry whole wheat lasagna noodles, uncooked and broken into 3" pieces (or fafalle/bow ties)
3 cups frozen Italian mixed vegetables (can use any kind really)
2 (19 oz.) cans red kidney beans, drained & rinsed if you prefer
1/2 cup light ricotta cheese

Directions:
In a large pot, mix together the first 5 ingredients; bring to a boil.
Add noodles and remaining ingredients, reduce heat and simmer until noodles are tender.
Stir occasionally to keep ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
