Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons BBQ sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) package white corn tortilla chips
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
3 cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sliced pickled jalapenos
1/2 cup hickory wood chips, soaked

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in a medium bowl. Coat with olive oil, sprinkle with chili powder, and turn to combine evenly.
Set up a grill for indirect heat. Cook chicken breasts over high heat, about 2 minutes per side. Finish cooking over indirect heat, covered, about 5 minutes per side. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes and coat evenly with BBQ sauce in a small bowl.
Arrange a portion of tortilla chips in a single layer on a grill tray, cast iron griddle, or disposable foil pan. Sprinkle black beans and 1/2 of the shredded cheese on top. Add a second layer of chips. Arrange chicken on top and cover with remaining cheese. Top with jalapeno slices.
Add wood chips to charcoal. Place nachos over indirect heat and cover grill. Grill until cheese is melted, rotating tray at least once, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a very simple and surprisingly flavorful recipe for smoked nachos prepared on a charcoal grill. The chips, cheese, and beans really soak up the smoke flavor in just a few minutes. Smoke is the most important ingredient, so a charcoal grill is required (unless you can use wood chips in your gas grill). We usually serve it as an appetizer, but it is often requested as the main dish.
