Title:
Easy Chicken and Wild Rice Casserole Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
2 (3 pound) fryer chickens
water to cover
1 cup dry sherry
1  onion, sliced
½ cup sliced celery
1 ½ teaspoons salt
½ teaspoon curry powder
½ cup butter
1 pound fresh mushrooms
2 (16 ounce) packages long grain and wild rice mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place chicken in a deep pot and cover with water; add sherry, onion, celery, salt, and curry powder. Bring liquid to a boil, cover pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink near the bone, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Strain broth from chicken mixture into a bowl and transfer chicken to a work surface to cool until easily handled. Pull meat from the bones and cut into bite-size pieces. Discard bones, onion, and celery.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute mushrooms until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Bring reserved chicken broth and wild rice to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain excess liquid, fluff rice with a fork, and cook uncovered 5 minutes more.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine chicken, rice, and about 1/2 of the mushrooms in a 4-quart casserole dish. Mix mushroom soup and sour cream together in a bowl and stir into chicken-rice mixture. Arrange remaining mushrooms in a circle on top of the casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 1 hour.
