Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
1-1/4 cup sifted flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
4-6 peaches, peeled and sliced
2 egg yolks, slightly beaten
1-1/2 cups sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Sift together dry ingredients and add to the creamed mixture.  Reserve 1/3 cup of pastry mixture.  Press the rest of the pastry mixture into the bottom and partially up the sides of a greased 8" x 8" pan.  Spread peaches on top of the pastry mixture, covering completely.
Sprinkle reserved pastry mixture on top of peaches.
Bake for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile blend the egg yolks and sour cream.  Pour over the peaches and bake for 25 minutes longer.  Let cool.  This can be served cold or at room temperature.

Description: 
The minute fresh peaches were available at the Farmer's Market in the summer, someone in our family was requesting that my mom make this dessert!  It's one of those pleasant tastes of summer, but we have used drained canned peaches to pretend it's summer all year round!
