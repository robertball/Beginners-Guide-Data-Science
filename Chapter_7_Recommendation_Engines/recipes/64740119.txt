olive oil spray
1 small onion, chopped
1 (15.5 oz) can black beans, not drained
1 (15.5-oz) can kidney beans, not drained
1 (8-oz) can tomato sauce
10 oz package frozen corn kernels
2 (10 oz) cans diced tomatoes w/chilies (Rotel)
24 oz (3) boneless skinless chicken breasts
4 ounce can chopped green chili peppers
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 1/2 tablespoons cumin
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Press saute and spray the insert with oil, add the onion and stir, cooking until soft and golden, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Press cancel to prevent getting a burn notice, then deglaze the pot with 1/4 cup water.
Add the chicken and season both sides with half of the taco seasoning.
Add the beans, corn, green chilies, then finish with the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce.
Add 1/2 cup water plus the remaining taco seasonings and gently stir without moving the chicken.
Cover and cook high pressure 25 minutes. Natural release, then remove the chicken and shred with two forks. Return the chicken to the pot and mix to combine.
Top with fresh cilantro and serve. Makes about 11 cups.
