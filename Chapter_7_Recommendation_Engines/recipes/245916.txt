Description: 
Nothing exotic here except perfect brown rice every time. I was surprised that there was no recipe for this already. I hated making brown rice on the stove top, so I have used this for almost 20 years. Smells like popcorn when it is baking. Be creative! Add spices to match any meal. Make a double recipe and you have the beginnings for a breakfast frittata or stir fried rice.
