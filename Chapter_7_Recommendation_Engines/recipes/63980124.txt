Ingredients:
Good-Quality Vodka
Extra Dry Vermouth
Olive Brine
Large Pitted Olives
Blue Cheese Crumbles

Directions:
Fill a shaker with 3-4 ice cubes (not too much to avoid watering down your drink). Add 2 parts good quality vodka, 2 parts olive brine, 1/2 part Extra Dry Vermouth. Shake 3-4 times (again, don't over do it to avoid watering down the drink) and pour into martini glass. Add 2-4 homemade blue-cheese stuffed olives to really top it off!
