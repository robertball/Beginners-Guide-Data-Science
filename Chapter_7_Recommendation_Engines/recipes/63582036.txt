Ingredients:
3 cups broccoli florets
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch strips
1 onion coarsely chopped or sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons chile paste
4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce

1+ tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup chicken stock
cornstarch and water
4 cups cooked jasmine rice

Directions:
Place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 5 minutes.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the chicken, onions, and garlic until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
Stir the hoisin sauce, chile paste, and soy sauce into the skillet. Season with ginger, red pepper flakes, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Stir in the chicken stock and simmer about 2 minutes. Mix in the steamed broccoli until coated with the sauce mixture.
Thicken sauce with a little cornstarch and minimal amount of water.
Serve over Jasmine rice.
