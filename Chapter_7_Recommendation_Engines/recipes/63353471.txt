Ingredients:
Shortcake
2 c. flour
2 TBS. sugar
3 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 c. butter
1 beaten egg
2/3 c. milk  ( I probably add another 2 Tbs of milk)

Directions:
Cut butter into dry ingredients until mixture looks like course crumbs.  (mine does not look course but are small)
Combine beaten egg and milk.  Add to dry ingredients and stir until moistened.  Spread into a 9 inch round or square greased pan.
Bake 450 for 15-18 min.
Whipped cream
beat 1 cup whipping cream until thick.  When almost thick add powdered sugar and continue beating until thick.  I don't know how much.  Maybe 1/2 cup.  I just add until I like the taste.
You may like to use 2 cups.  More delicious with enough whipped cream.
