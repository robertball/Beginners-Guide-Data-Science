Ingredients:
6 Boneless Skinless chicken breasts
Salt to taste (approximately 1 tablespoon)
Pepper to taste(approximately 1 tablespoon)
6 Tablespoons pesto sauce
6 Slices bacon
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Lay chicken flat in 9 x 9 cooking dish.
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.
Spread one tablespoon of pesto sauce over each piece of chicken.
Wrap each piece of chicken in bacon and secure bacon underneath. (Toothpicks can be used to do this but I find that usually the bacon stays wrapped just fine without.)
Pour vegetable oil around chicken, in order to keep chicken moist so it does not dry out.
Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked throughout and bacon is crispy.
