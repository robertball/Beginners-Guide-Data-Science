Ingredients:
2 multi grain wraps
2 tablespoons Neufchatel cheese
2 leaves romaine lettuce
1 cup fresh spinach
6 slices deli sliced roast beef
2 slices reduced-fat Swiss cheese
6 cherry tomatoes, halved
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the wraps in the microwave on High for 30 seconds.
On the right side of one wrap (the side that will fold in last), spread 1 tablespoon Neufchatel cheese about 2/3 of the way down that side. Layer half of the romaine, spinach, beef, Swiss cheese, and tomatoes in the center of the wrap, leaving 1/3 of the wrap open at the bottom. Fold that third up over the bottom of your fillings, then fold in the left side and roll toward the right, letting the Neufchatel seal the wrap together. Repeat with the second wrap.
