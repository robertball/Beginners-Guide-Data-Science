Ingredients:
4 (1/4-inch-thick) boneless and skinless chicken cutlets (about 1 1/2 pounds)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 large eggs
1 cup fine dry bread crumbs
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
Cheesecloth
3 Bowls (shallow yet large enough for coating chicken.)
Wax paper
Lemon wedges and fresh parsley for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200Â°F.
Place cheesecloth over individual cutlets. Pound each cutlet with a rolling pin to desired thinness.
Stir together salt, flour and pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs and a pinch of salt and pepper in another bowl. Add bread crumbs to a third bowl.
Pat chicken dry and dredge in seasoned flour, tapping off excess flour. Dip in eggs, letting excess drip off, then dredge in bread crumbs, coating completely. Transfer to a wax-paper-lined plate.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12 inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot (but not smoking) then fry cutlets in 2 batches, turning over once, until golden brown and just cooked through (approximately 3 minutes each.) Add 2 tablespoons oil to skillet between batches. Drain cutlets on paper towels, then transfer to the oven to keep warm.
Garnish with a lemon wedge and fresh parsley.
Serve with boiled potatoes, cabbage and knedlicky for a traditional Czech dinner. (Don't forget the beer!)
