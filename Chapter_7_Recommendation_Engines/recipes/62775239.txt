Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
3 cans (14.5 oz) reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 (10-ounce) package frozen whole kernel corn
1/2 cup salsa
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup broken-up baked tortilla chips

Directions:
In a soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chicken, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the chicken is browned on the outside, stirring frequently.
Stir in the chicken broth, corn, and salsa; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink.
Stir in the cilantro, ladle into bowls, and serve topped with the tortilla chips
