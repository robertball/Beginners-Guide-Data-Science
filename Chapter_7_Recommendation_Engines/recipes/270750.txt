Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 medium potatoes, scrubbed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Stir in olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Use a fork to poke about 5 holes into each potato. Place each potato on a sheet of aluminum foil about 6 inches wide. Brush butter mixture over potatoes, making sure to evenly coat each one. Wrap up completely in foil. Poke 5 more holes into the wrapped potatoes.
Bake potatoes in the center of the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Spread leftover butter mixture over potatoes after cutting them open.

Description: 
This recipe for baked potatoes is delicious with steak, meatloaf, or by itself. I never was fan of the potato's skin until I began making this recipe! These potatoes taste amazing loaded with cheese, sour cream, and/or chives! If you want to get fancy, use this recipe as a base recipe for one of the many potato skin, whipped baked potato, or other more-to-it recipes on here.
