Ingredients:
1/2 C coarse ground coffee
2 C cold water
1 C sugar
2 C water
cream or milk, to taste

Directions:
In a French Press or large measuring cup, pour the water over the coffee grounds and let stand overnight.
In the meantime make a simple syrup.  Combine the sugar and second measure of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar.  Pour into a container and store in the fridge.
The next day strain the coffee, either with the French Press plunger or through a coffee filter in a mesh strainer.
Pour up to half a glass of this coffee concentrate over ice and add the simple syrup, cream and a little more water to taste.

Description: 
I'm relatively new to coffee drinking, but have graduated from instant to actual brewed liquid energy.  I was intrigued when I read about cold brewing and how it can make a smoother beverage with more kick.  So I gave it a try, and I am a convert.
