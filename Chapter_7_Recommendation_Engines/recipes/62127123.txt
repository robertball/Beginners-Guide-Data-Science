Ingredients:
2 C Lowfat Milk
1/4 C Sugar
1/4 C Dutch processed cocoa powder
2 T Cornstarch
1/8 t Salt
1 T Brandy (optional)
2 Large Eggs
1 t vanilla extract

Directions:
Beat eggs and vanilla in medium size bowl, set aside.
In saucepan, whisk together remaining ingredients over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 6-8 minutes until boiling and thickened.
Slowly pour half of the milk mixture into the beaten eggs while stirring.  Then pour it back into the saucepan. (This prevents the eggs from scrambling.) Cook over low heat until thick, for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. (Do not boil.)
Chill, top with whip cream, and serve.
