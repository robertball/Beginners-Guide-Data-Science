Southwestern Lasagna Recipe

Ingredients:
2 pounds Chorizo (chor-EAT-so) sausage meat
(I use ground chorizo meat, not the
stuffed sausages, but they’ll do okay,
too. If you can’t find chorizo, try
substituting 2 pounds of lean ground
beef and a couple packages of taco
seasoning. It ain’t the same, but
it’ll be edible!)
1-28 oz. can plus 1-10 oz. can of crushed
tomatoes (that’s about 38 oz. total
weight, or approximately 4 cups)
2 well-rounded Tablespoons of ground
cumin (cumino)
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves of garlic, minced
10-20 sprigs of cilantro, chopped fine (or
to taste  I use 10 and the flavor is
very mild)
1-7 oz. can of diced green chiles. These
are mild green chili peppers, NOT bell
peppers.
1-4 oz. can of diced jalapeños (might be a
bit spicy for some people, so you
might make the first batch with just
1/4 to 1/2 of a can)
1-32 oz. container of Ricotta cheese
4 Large eggs
1 pound Mexican 4-cheese, grated. Monterey
Jack or Havarti will do in a pinch,
but like I said, it ain’t the same.
1 box Oven-ready lasagna noodles

Directions:
Brown the sausage, drain and set aside. If you’re using ground beef, cook according to the directions on the taco seasoning package, but without adding any water. Drain and set aside.
Put the tomatoes, cumin, onion, garlic, cilantro, green chilies, and jalapeños into a saucepan. Simmer until the onion is soft (about 45-60 minutes). Proceed with the next step while it’s simmering. Set it aside if you’re not done with the next step by the time it’s done.
Lightly whip the eggs and stir in the ricotta. Set aside.
Pre-heat the oven to 350.
Place 1/3 of the sauce in a large casserole dish (I use 2-8”x8”x2” baking dishes). Note: this will make just a thin layer on the bottom of the dish. Top with a layer of pasta.
Top with the sausage, 1/3 of the sauce, and 1/2 of the Mexican 4-cheese.
Top with a layer of pasta.
Add the ricotta mix and top with a layer of pasta.
Top with the remaining sauce and cheese.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30-45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for 15-30 minutes or until the top is browned.
Serves 12 pitiful, spineless, bloated New England codfish. Serves 6 hungry ranch hands
