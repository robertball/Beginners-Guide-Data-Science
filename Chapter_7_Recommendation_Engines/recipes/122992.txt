Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 green onion, sliced
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup cubed cooked chicken
1/2 teaspoon celery seed

Directions:
In a bowl, beat eggs, onion, parsley, tarragon, salt and pepper. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add egg mixture. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Sprinkle with chicken and celery seed. When the eggs are set, remove from the heat; fold omelet in half.

Description: 
Tender chunks of leftover chicken provide a nice change of pace from the usual ham in the omelet Sonja Blow makes in Groveland, California. 'Served with toast and tomato slices, it's a special breakfast for two,' she notes.
