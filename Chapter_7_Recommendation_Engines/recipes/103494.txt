Description: 
An easy to assemble dish of chickpeas in a curry tomato sauce that is cooked in the microwave.  Serve with plain rice or noodles.  If you're using canned chickpeas (like we do here at college) make sure you drain and rinse them before adding them. Play with other spices too if you'd like.
