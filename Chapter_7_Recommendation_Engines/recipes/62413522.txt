Ingredients:
2 packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110-115 degrees)
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons butter, divided use
1 egg
1 cup warm milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water along with 1 teaspoon of the sugar; let it stand until bubbly, about 15 minutes.  While yeast proofs, measure out remaining ingredients.
Stir together 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, remaining sugar, and salt until well mixed.
When yeast mixture is ready, in a stand mixer add the flour mixture, 6 tablespoons melted butter, egg, and milk; beat until the mixture is well mixed, up to 5 minutes.
Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour.
Cover bowl and let dough rise in warm place until doubled, about an hour.
Melt 6 tablespoons remaining butter and pour half into the bottom of a 9x13 pan, tilting the pan to coat the sides.
Beat down the dough and form into twelve balls, placing into buttered pan.
Drizzle remaining butter over the dough.
Cover the pan lightly and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 425 degrees for 12-17 minutes or until lightly browned.
Serve hot.

Warning!  As the name implies, these soft, pillowy rolls are drenched in butter.  You won't need to put extra butter on the table!  My dinner guests expect these!
