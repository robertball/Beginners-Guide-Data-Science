Ingredients:
2 cups barley
4 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrots
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup chopped onion
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1  yellow zucchini, cut into half moons
1 cup fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
2 cups broccoli florets
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
⅓ cup sour cream
¼ cup grated Locatella cheese
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon ground thyme
1 cup green peas
1 cup whole kernel corn
1 cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
2 cups shredded cooked chicken
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring the barley and chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 minutes.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the celery, carrots, garlic, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, zucchini, green beans, and broccoli. Continue cooking and stirring until the broccoli is tender, about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat.
Combine cream cheese, cream of chicken soup, sour cream, Locatella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, nutmeg, oregano, basil, and thyme in a large bowl, mixing until smooth. Stir in the prepared barley, peas, corn, roasted red peppers, spinach, and shredded chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Spread mixture into a large baking dish and top with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, and cheese has melted, 20 to 30 minutes.
