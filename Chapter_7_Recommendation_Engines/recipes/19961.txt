Ingredients:
1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine
1/2 cup rum
1 lemon, sliced
1 orange, sliced in rounds
1 lime, sliced
1 pint strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 apple, cored and sliced
9 whole cloves
1 liter lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage

Directions:
In a large jar or pitcher combine wine and rum with sliced lemon, orange, lime, and strawberry. Push cloves into apples slices and add to mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight (the longer the better).
To serve,  pour a tall glass half-full of wine mixture. Fill the rest of the glass with soda and stir gently. Remove cloves from apple slices and garnish drinks by spooning some marinated fruit into glass.

Description: 
This is a wonderfully flavorful summertime (or anytime) beverage.  Most any fruit you would like to use (except bananas) will probably work with this recipe.  You can even use frozen fruit like peaches and berries (but thaw them, first).
