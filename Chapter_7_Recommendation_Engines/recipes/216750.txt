Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 cup green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped celery (optional)
50 shucked oysters
1 tablespoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®)
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup warm chicken stock

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions, bell pepper, garlic, green onions, and celery in the melted butter until tender, about 10 minutes. Add the oysters to the vegetable mixture and cook until the oysters are cooked through, about 10 minutes more.
Stir the Creole seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce into the oysters and vegetables to combine. Scatter the flour over the mixture and stir until thickened. Slowly pour the chicken stock into the mixture, stirring as you add it. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir until the liquid reaches a desired thickness, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is great as an appetizer served over crackers or sliced toasted French bread. Also, the dish can be poured over pasta if enough gravy is made. This recipe has the basic ingredients. You should make the sauce as thick as you like. Never use cold water when thickening any gravy or roux. It will ruin the bond between the flour and oil.
