Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 egg
3 tbsp honey
3 tbsp molasses
1 cup peanut butter
1/2 tsp vanilla
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
2 ounces semi sweet chocolate, melted (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 degrees
Lightly grease or spray 2 cookie sheets
In a large bowl, mix butter, sugar, egg, honey, molasses, peanut butter, and vanilla.
Add baking soda and salt
Gradually add flour while mixing.
If desired, swirl the melted chocolate using a knife, being careful not to combine it into the dough.
Using about a tablespoon of dough per cookie, roll dough into balls and place onto cookie sheet.
With a fork, press down each ball once horizontally & once vertically so dough is about 1/4 inch thick.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
Allow to cool 10-15 before moving cookies.
