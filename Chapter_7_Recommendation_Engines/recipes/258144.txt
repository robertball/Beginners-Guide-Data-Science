Ingredients:
6 ears corn, husked
½ cup butter, melted
1 pinch salt (optional)
½ cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 (12 ounce) package smoked bacon

Directions:
Place each ear of corn on a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to wrap it completely; brush with butter. Season with salt.
Spread brown sugar evenly on a large plate. Roll buttered corn in brown sugar.
Wrap 2 bacon slices around the length of each ear of corn. Wrap foil around corn, enclosing it completely.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Cook foil-wrapped corn over indirect heat, turning occasionally, until corn is tender and bacon is crisp, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
Fresh ears of corn are coated in a mixture of butter and brown sugar, then wrapped in bacon before either grilling or baking. Decadent, to say the least. But worth the compliments you'll get at this summer's BBQs!
