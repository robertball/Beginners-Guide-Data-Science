Ingredients:
l lb elbow macaroni
1 lb Yukon Gold Potatoes, 1/4 in cube (do NOT use russetts)
2 hard boiled eggs, cooled
1/2 cup fine chopped red onions
1/2 cup shredded carrots
3 1/2 cups Best Foods mayo (AKA Helman's on East Coast)
1/2 tsp. fresh minced garlic
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp basil

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package.  When 6 minutes left on timer, add diced potatoes  - potatoes will be firm. Don't overcook).  Dice eggs (egg slicer works great).  Combine all ingredients except pasta and potatoes, mix well, the fold in pasta and potatoes.  Refrigerate for at least a couple hours before serving so flavors can meld.  This will last several day in frig and gets better as it sits.
NOTE:  this may seem like a lot of mayo, but after it sits, it will be the perfect amount.  Not too much.
