Ingredients:
4 cups Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced mushrooms
15 pitted Kalamata olives, drained (reserve 1/2 teaspoon brine) and diced
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 teaspoons lemon-pepper seasoning (such as Mrs. DashÂ®)
1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Mix sprouts, onion, mushrooms, olives, lemon juice, garlic, lemon-pepper seasoning, Sriracha, dill, and black pepper in a large bowl; stir to season vegetables completely.
Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook Brussels sprouts mixture in hot oil, stirring occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I am committed to raising the stature of the lowly and the much maligned Brussels sprout. If we don't give up on this great vegetable, we can make it a well admired side dish to any meal. Go sprouts!
