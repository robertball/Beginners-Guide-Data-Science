Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound shredded cabbage
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine (Shaoxing wine)

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook for a few seconds until it begins to brown. Stir in the cabbage until it is coated in oil; cover the wok, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the soy sauce, and cook and stir for another minute. Increase the heat to high, and stir in the Chinese cooking wine. Cook and stir until the cabbage is tender, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
A very simple stir-fry dish. The reason for using only soya sauce for stir-frying cabbage is that it brings out the natural sweetness in the cabbage itself.
