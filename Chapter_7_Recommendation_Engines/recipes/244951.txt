Ingredients:
2 large eggs
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
3 cups bread crumbs, or as needed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
vegetable oil for frying
12 boneless chicken breast halves, pounded very thin
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Whisk eggs, honey, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl. Mix bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.
Heat 1/2 to 1 inch of vegetable oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). You can also use a deep fryer.
Put chicken slices in the egg mixture and knead until fully coated. Press chicken in the bread crumbs until evenly coated.
Working in batches, carefully place chicken in the hot oil using tongs and cook until no longer pink in the center and browned on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve with lemon wedges.
