Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup baking cocoa
1 cup canola oil
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 cup (6 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts, divided
14 ounces caramels
1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat the sugar, cocoa, oil, eggs and milk. Combine the flour, salt and baking powder; gradually add to egg mixture until well blended. Fold in chocolate chips and 1/2 cup walnuts.
Spoon two-thirds of the batter into a greased 10x15 baking pan. Bake at 350Â° for 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat the caramels and condensed milk over low heat until caramels are melted. Pour over baked brownie layer. Sprinkle with remaining walnuts.
Drop remaining batter by teaspoonfuls over caramel layer; carefully swirl brownie batter with a knife.
Bake 30-35 minutes longer or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out with moist crumbs (do not overbake). Cool on a wire rack.

The two hardest things about these brownies is unwrapping all those carmels and not eating the whole pan!
