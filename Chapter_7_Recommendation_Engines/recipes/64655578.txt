•	4 teaspoons baking powder
•	1 teaspoon salt

•	2 large eggs
•	2 Tablespoons honey
•	¼ cup unrefined coconut oil melted

Directions:
Preheat lightly oiled griddle to a medium low heat.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flours, baking powder, poppy seeds and salt.
In a large bowl beat eggs add mashed bananas, coconut oil, honey, milk, and vanilla and whisk together.
Pour dry mixture into liquid mixture and blend all ingredients with a whisk or wood spoon just until incorporated.
Ladle the batter onto the griddle (drop blueberries onto pancakes at this time if you are adding them) and cook 3 minutes or until edges start to dry.
Flip and cook an additional 2 minutes or until center springs back to touch.
