Ingredients:
4 pounds small Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon coarse salt
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons coarse salt
1 pound bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1 cup diced onion
2 cups beef broth
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover by several inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, add 1 tablespoon salt, and reduce to a gentle boil. Cook until potatoes are just tender when pierced with a knife. Do not overcook. Drain, cool, and transfer to a bowl.
While the potatoes cook, combine the vinegar, sugar, and remaining salt in a small saucepan and place over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Drizzle over the potatoes, and gently toss to coat.
Saute bacon in a large skillet placed over medium-low heat, stirring frequently until browned and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Drain excess fat from skillet, leaving a thin coat of bacon grease in skillet.
Saute onions in skillet with the reserved bacon grease until translucent but not browned. Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half; about 20 minutes. Pour the broth mixture over the potatoes, and sprinkle with the bacon and chopped parsley. Gently stir, and serve immediately.
