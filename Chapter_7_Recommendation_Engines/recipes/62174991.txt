Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups sliced onions (I used 5-6 onions)
4 (10.5 ounce) cans beef broth (I used 2 26oz beef broth)
2 tablespoons dry sherry (optional)do this one, yummy
1 teaspoon dried thyme
I added the following:
minced garlic (about 1 tablespoon)
flour 1-2 tablespoons
1/2 cup vermouth
salt and pepper to taste
4 slices French bread (toast first)
4 slices provolone cheese
2 slices Swiss cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
if you have it on hand, use some grated gruyere cheese. Really adds some wonderful flavor

Directions:
Melt butter with olive oil in an 8 quart stock pot on medium heat. Add onions and stir until caramelized (takes 50-60 mins for 5-6 onions) Add minced garlic last minute and 1/2 cup Vermouth and cook till almost dry.  Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon flour over onions. Add beef broth, sherry and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Heat the oven broiler.
Ladle soup into oven safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss,1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon gruyere. Place bowls on cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and  browns slightly.
This is even better warmed up the next day!!
