Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package Dark Chocolate cake mix
2 (5.9 ounce) packages instant chocolate pudding mix (sugar free mix works well)
1 cup sour cream
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup warm water or coffee
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (I used mini-chips)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the cake and pudding mixes, sour cream, oil, beaten eggs and water.  Stir in the chocolate chips and pour batter into a well greased 12 cup tube pan.
Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until top is springy to the touch and a wooden toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool cake thoroughly in pan for 10-15 minutes before inverting onto a plate. Glaze with Chocolate Glaze. Garnish with fresh raspberries, if desired.
Chocolate Glaze:
1 cup heavy cream
8oz chocolate, chopped or 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips
2Tbs butter, cut into small pieces.
Heat cream until it reaches boiling point. Remove from heat. Pour over chocolate. Stir gently until chocolate is melted. Stir in butter. Use immediately.

Description: 
My family calls this a keeper. I used a Dark Chocolate mix, added coffee to the batter and finished the cake with a rich chocolate glaze. 
I sometimes serve small slices with a homemade raspberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream.Modified from: Too Much Chocolate Cake
