Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine pasta
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
6 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 cup bay scallops
1/2 cup calamari rings
2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 cups half-and-half
1 cup snow pea pods, trimmed
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms; saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp, scallops, calamari, seafood seasoning, and pepper flakes; saute for 1 minute. Stir in half-and-half and pea pods. Sprinkle in Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly, until all has been added. Mix in parsley and season with salt and pepper.
Reduce heat slightly and cook, stirring frequently to keep from boiling, until sauce has reached desired thickness and seafood is fully cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Add drained fettuccine and toss until thoroughly combined. Serve hot in shallow bowls.
