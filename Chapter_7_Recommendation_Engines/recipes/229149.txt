Ingredients:
2 cups finely diced green tomatoes
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts
1 cup canola oil
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix tomatoes, sugar, walnuts, canola oil, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl until well blended. Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until just blended. Spoon batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of each loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring loaves to wire racks to cool completely.

I'm nuts too...
Description: 
I grew up thinking that this was zucchini bread...ha! Once I found out it was actually green tomatoes, I was a little weirded out, but still went back for more. An excellent way to use up those green tomatoes in a very tasty bread.
