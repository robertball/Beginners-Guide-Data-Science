Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (6 ounce) chicken breasts
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side.
Pour broth over chicken and cover skillet; lower heat to low and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving broth mixture in the skillet.
Pour lemon juice into broth mixture and simmer until liquid is reduced by 1/3, 2 to 3 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
