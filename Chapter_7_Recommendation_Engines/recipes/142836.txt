Ingredients:
1 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed
3 tablespoons garlic flavored olive oil
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
2 drops chili oil
1/4 teaspoon packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven broiler, and move oven rack into the top position.
Place the snap peas onto a baking pan, drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the snap peas out into a single layer.
Broil the snap peas in the preheated oven until tender, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, brown sugar, and sesame seeds in a large bowl. When the snap peas come out of the oven, toss them immediately with the sauce.
