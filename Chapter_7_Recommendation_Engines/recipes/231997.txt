Ingredients:
4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
2 cups coarsely chopped almonds
3/4 cup honey
1/2 cup butter
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Mix oats and almonds in a large bowl.
Combine honey, butter, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil for 1 minute. Pour honey mixture over oat mixture; toss to coat. Spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 5 minutes, until granola is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Fold in raisins and bake for 2 more minutes. Cool and crumble.
