Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
12 (6 ounce) lamb loin chops (1-inch thick)
1 medium sweet red pepper, thinly sliced
2 small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 medium Sweet Onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons oil, mustard, vinegar, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper; set aside 1 tablespoon. Place the lamb chops on a broiler pan. Spread remaining mustard mixture over both sides of chops. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute the red pepper, zucchini and onion in remaining oil until crisp-tender. Stir in reserved mustard mixture; toss to coat. Serve with lamb chops.

Description: 
One of the streamlined suppers Ruth might serve at a family function is savory Lamb with Sauteed Veggies.    'My parents raised sheep for more than 30 years, so I have several lamb recipes,' she shares. 'Not only are these chops tender, but they cook quickly.'    While the lamb broils, Ruth sautes red pepper and zucchini to accompany it. 'People always comment on this great combination,' she assures.
