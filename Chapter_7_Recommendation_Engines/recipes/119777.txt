Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream the butter, peanut butter and brown sugar.  Beat in egg and vanilla.  Combine the dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk.  Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 26-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
For frosting, cream peanut butter and sugar in a small mixing bowl.  Add the honey and vanilla.  Beat in enough milk to achieve a spreading consistency.  Frost cupcakes.
