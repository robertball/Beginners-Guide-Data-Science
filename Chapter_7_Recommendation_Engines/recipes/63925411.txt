Ingredients:
1 Cup Water
1/4 Cup Whole Milk
2 1/2 Tbsp Butter
1 Packet Instant Yeast
3 1/2 Cup Bread Flour
1 Tbsp Sugar
1 3/4 Tsp Salt
0-3 Tbsp Water (optional)

Directions:
Heat 1 cup water, milk and butter in a microwavable measuring cup until very warm (110-120 degrees F).
Pour liquids in to bread pan and add yeast. Let yeast activate for 10 minutes.
Add bread flour, sugar and salt.
Set Machine for basic, light crust, 2 lb loaf.
Start Machine.
If you truly want the perfect consistency, watch machine on second kneading cycle. Add water (if needed) 1 tbsp at a time to ensure a soft dough that slightly sticks to the sides during kneading. If your dough is hard, your bread will be more dense.(Depending on the weather where we live, I sometimes add up to 3 tbsp, sometimes none)
Let bread finish all cycles, cool 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
I had seen a very popular recipe similar to this that included 1/4 cup vegetable oil. I found that recipe flavorless, so I set out to make more of a country white. This bread is light and tender and perfect for toasting and sandwiches!
