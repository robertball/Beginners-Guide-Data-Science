Ingredients:
1 cup Italian bread crumbs
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 cup vegetable oil
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
CRANBERRY ORANGE SAUCE:
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/2 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup water
HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup water, divided
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup prepared mustard

Directions:
In a plastic bag, mix bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese; set aside. In a small bowl, combine garlic and oil. Flatten the chicken to 1/2-in. thickness; cut into 1-in.-wide strips. Dip strips in oil; coat with crumb mixture. Place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, combine the sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan. Add cranberries, orange juice and water; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir 2-3 minutes more, crushing the berries while stirring. For honey mustard sauce, dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon water in a saucepan. Add honey, mustard and remaining water; bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Serve with chicken for dipping.
