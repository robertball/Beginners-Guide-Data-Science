Ingredients:
1 Pkg (16oz) Frozen Chopped Spinach
1 pkg (4oz) light Feta Cheese
16 oz Low Moisture Mozzerella Cheese Shredded
1/2 Cup Parmesan Cheese
1/4-1/2 Jar Light Ranch Dressing (I prefer T. Marzetti Light Classic Ranch)
Cavender's Greek Seasoning to taste
1 pkg 10 Burrito Size Wheat Tortillas
Spray oil

Directions:
Soak Spinach in cool water until thawed.  Set aside.  Lay out 5 Wheat Tortillas.  Evenly spread about 1-2 tablespoons Ranch Dressing on each of the 5 Tortillas.  Drain the Spinach and squeeze out excess water.  Evenly spread Spinach on all 5 tortillas and follow with the Feta Cheese, Mozzerella Cheese and Parmesan Cheese.  Sprinkle with Greek Seasoning.  Place the other 5 tortillas on top.  If you have a quesadilla maker then lightly spray with only and place in quesadilla maker for recommended amount of time.  If you do not have one use a medium skillet and spray lightly with oil.  Place entire quesadilla in pan and lightly toast one side (about 2 minutes) then turn and do the same to the next side.  Let cool about 4 minutes then cut like a pie.
