Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) containers applesauce
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup water
1 fluid ounce coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua®), or more to taste
1 tablespoon egg replacer
1 tablespoon honey, or more to taste
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.
Combine applesauce, sugar, peanut butter, water, coffee-flavored liqueur, egg replacer, honey, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; mix until well-blended.
Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together in another bowl. Stir into applesauce mixture. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle walnuts on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 18 to 25 minutes.
