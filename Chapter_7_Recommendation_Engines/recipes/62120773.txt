1 large package egg noodles, cooked according to package
16 oz. Velveeta cheese or other processed cheese, block or shredded.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Brown the ground beef with the diced onion, adding the canned mushrooms just before beef is no longer pink.
Combine soup and tomatoes, adding to cooked beef mixture.
Mix all with noodles and place in 13x9 casserole dish.
Add slices of Velveeta over top of casserole, or to save time, use the shredded Velveeta.
Bake for one hour until cheese is lightly browned and casserole is bubbling around edges.

Description: 
This is a filling dish that will feed a crowd!  I inherited this recipe from my mother-in-law who made this frequently during the recession of the 1970's.  The ground beef, Golden Mushroom soup and tomatoes mix wonderfully over noodles to create a savory, unique flavor.
