Ingredients:
1 apple - peeled, cored and shredded
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup applesauce
2 eggs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
Mix together apple, cheese, applesauce, eggs and olive oil in a bowl. Combine whole wheat flour, oats, and baking powder in a separate bowl; stir by hand into the wet ingredients until well blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool completely before serving.

Description: 
These are nice cupcake treats for dogs that I made up for my dog Presley's 4th birthday.  They are perfect for dogs with food allergies. Warning: they don't look pretty, but Fido will love them!  These freeze well, and you can zap them in the microwave for a nice, occasional dog snack.
