Ingredients:
1 eggplant, sliced length-wise
olive oil
salt
1 onion, sliced; white wine; tomato sauce or ajvar; roasted red pepper relish; mozzarella cheese; sliced dinner rolls or hoagies

Directions:
Caramelizing the onions is going to take longer than roasting the eggplant.
Slice the onion. Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan heated at medium high. Then add the onions. Stir occasionally to prevent onions from getting burnt. After 15 or 20 minutes, deglaze the onions with a generous splash of white wine. The onions will turn brown and taste sweet. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
While keeping an eye on the onions, slice eggplant length-wise. Cover two baking sheet pans in tin foil. Brush with olive oil before you lay eggplant slices on the pans. Brush eggplant slices with olive oil. Season with salt. Roast for 15 minutes in the oven. During the last minute or two, place slices of mozzarella cheese on top of each eggplant slice. When the cheese has melted, take the pans out of the oven.
Cut each roll or hoagie length-wise and toast each roll in a heated pan on the stove.
Place an eggplant slice inside a roll. Slather tomato sauce or roasted red pepper relish on top of the melted cheese. Place caramelized onions on top. Make another layer of eggplant, cheese, sauce and onion if you want. Serve sandwiches and don't be afraid to be messy.
