Ingredients:
1 lb. chicken thighs (cut in cubes if desired)
1 cup chicken stock
1/4 tsp. minced ginger root
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbsp. cornstarch
3 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 medium onion, diced
1-14 oz. can coconut milk (use only 8 oz. if you want it thicker)
2 Tbsp. Thai red curry paste (more if desired)
Salt and pepper
1 cup frozen peas
Fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
If desired, brown chicken, onions, ginger, and garlic.
To simplify, place all ingredients (except for coconut milk and peas) in slow cooker and cook for 3-4 hours on high or 6-8 hours on low.
In small bowl, combine curry paste and 1/2 cup coconut milk. Once blended, add to slow cooker with remaining coconut milk and peas. Cover and cook on high for 30 minutes. May garnish with cilantro.
Optional--also add coconut milk in the beginning, so only peas need to be added a few minutes before serving.
