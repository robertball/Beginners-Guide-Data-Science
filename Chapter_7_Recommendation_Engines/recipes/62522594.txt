Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 2/3 cups milk
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Simply combine all ingredients and mix well.  prepare 12 inch cast iron skillet by heating, then coat bottom and sides with 1 tablespoon butter.  Pour mixture in and bake at 400 for 30 minutes.  Test with toothpick.    (I used to make this in a 10 inch skillet, but the 12 inch is WAY better.  If you are using a 10 inch, cooking time will approach 45 minutes)
serve warm.

Description: 
***I got this recipe from a long-time friend several years ago and it's my most-used. I love to serve this melt-in-your mouth corn bread hot from the oven with butter and syrup. It gets rave reviews on holidays and at potluck dinners.                                                              --Nicole Callen,  Auburn, California***
