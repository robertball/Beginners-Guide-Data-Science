Amaretto Fudge Brownies Recipe

Ingredients:
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon table salt
2 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 good scoop of Amaretto Teeccino
More teeccino for sprinkling
1/3 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper.
Put the butter in a medium saucepan and set over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted.  Slide the pan from the heat and add the cocoa powder, whisking until the mixture is smooth.  Add the sugar and salt and whisk until blended.  Add the eggs one at a time, whisking after each addition just until blended.  Whisk in the vanilla with the second egg.  Sprinkle the flour and the teecino over the chocolate mixture and stir with a rubber spatula just until blended.
Scrape the batter in the prepared baking dish and spread evenly.  Scatter the teeccino and chocolate chips evenly over the batter.  Bake until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out with small clumps sticking to it, about 32 minutes for a glass dish, or much less for a dark dish (22 maybe?).  Transfer the baking dish to a rack to cool.
Cut the brownie after fully cooled.
