Ingredients:
2 lbs kielbasa sausage (chopped, 1/2" pcs.)
1 can each:
kidney beans
black beans
corn
pinto beans
chicken broth
2 cans of diced tomatoes (w/ garlic/basil)
1/2 green bell pepper
1/2 red bell pepper
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 medium onion
1/2 stick,butter
1 packet, taco seasoning
Optional garnishes:
sour cream
shredded cheese
green onion
tortilla chips

Directions:
Chop peppers & onion.  In a large pot, melt butter.  Saute garlic, peppers, and onion until soft.  Add kielbasa.  Cook until hot and flavors are melded.
Now just start opening your cans!  Empty into the pot, including the juices, all of the beans and tomatoes.  Drain the corn.  Add corn and chicken broth.  Stir well.
Cook until heated through & desired consistency.  After about an hour over medium heat, soup will thicken and be very rich.
We love to garnish ours with sour cream, shredded cheese, green onion, and tortilla chips!  Enjoy!
