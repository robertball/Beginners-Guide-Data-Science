Ingredients:
8 oz. uncooked pasta
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cups cooked cubed turkey
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tablespoons butter
2 Tablespoons EVOO
1/2 cup flour
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons capers
1 cup parmesan cheese, divided
S&P; to taste

Directions:
In a large skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the EVOO and saute the slice mushrooms and onions.  Pour out into a bowl and set aside. In a large pot of boiling water cook pasta until el dente.  While pasta is cooking, melt the butter and add the remaining tablespoon of EVOO over medium heat.  Add the flour and whisk into the melted butter.  When rue starts to bubble whisk in the broth until smooth.  Add the milk and Dijon.  When bubbling add in the garlic, capers and S&P.  Bring aauce to a slow bubble and add the cooked turkey, mushrooms and onion to it.  Stir 3/4 of a cup parmesan into the sauce.  Let sauce simmer for 2 minutes while you drain the pasta and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.  Add the pasta to the sauce and stir in completely.  Pour into a greased casserole, top with the remaining parmesan cheese.  Bake at 400 degrees for 17 minutes.  Remove from oven and serve with a crisp green salad.
