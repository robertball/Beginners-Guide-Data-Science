Description: 
Who knew cinnamon and chocolate would pair together so fabulously? I made a loaf, but feel free to make into muffins, if desired. The cinnamon I use is from Savory Spice Shop® and is not like the cinnamon from most retailers. If you're using cinnamon from a regular grocer, use a drop or two of essential cinnamon oil in addition to your cinnamon.
