Description: 
If your a busy working mom like I am you're going to LOVE this recipe.  If my husband gets home before I do he will start nibbling away it.  He says it just smells so good he can't resist a taste or two or three...The meat is so tender it literally falls apart and the gravy is delectible!  I usually serve this over steamed rice with a green leafy salad.
