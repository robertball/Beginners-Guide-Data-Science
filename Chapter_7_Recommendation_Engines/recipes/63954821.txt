Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil
2 lb shrimp, shelled and defined (more if you'd like)
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime
salt and pepper
6 cups green beans

Directions:
Heat a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Add oil to the pan, when hot add shrimp. Season with salt and pepper.
When the shrimp is cooked on one side, about 2 minutes, turn over and add garlic. Saute another minute or two until shrimp is cooked, careful not to overcook.
Remove from heat. Squeeze lime all over shrimp and toss with cilantro. Serve hot.
In a separate pan, add 6 cups green beans, crushed garlic to taste, and season with salt and pepper.
Cook on medium high for 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water and cover, cook for an additional 8 minutes.
Uncover and cook until water evaporates. Serve hot on the side of shrimp.
