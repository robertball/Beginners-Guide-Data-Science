Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup olive oil
20 large shrimp
15 large scallops
salt and pepper
4 cloves garlic
2 T. fresh oregano
2 T. fresh parsley
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 cup grated parmesan
juice of 1 lemon
1 pound cooked linguini

Directions:
Add the oil, butter and garlic to a large sauté pan and heat to medium.
When oil is hot and the garlic fragrant, add the scallops, shrimp, and a couple pinches of salt and black pepper.
After 2-3 minutes add oregano and parsley and sauté.
Keep turning the scallops and shrimp so both sides cook evenly and the shrimp is pink and cooked through.
Add the breadcrumbs and cheese, turn to coat well.
Add the lemon juice, stirring all to combine well.
Serve over cooked pasta.
