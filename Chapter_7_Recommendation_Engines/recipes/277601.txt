Ingredients:
6 cups water
1 (7.25 ounce) package macaroni and cheese dinner mix (such as KraftÂ®)
1/4 cup milk
4 tablespoons margarine
3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
nonstick cooking spray
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Pour water into a bowl and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni pasta from dinner package. Cook until tender, stirring occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain; do not rinse. Return to the pot and stir in included cheese sauce, milk, and margarine. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until well combined and cheese is melted.
Refrigerate macaroni and cheese until firm, 2 hours to overnight.
Scoop macaroni and cheese into 1 1/2-inch balls and place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet. Freeze for 1 hour.
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray the basket with nonstick cooking spray.
Mix panko, bread crumbs, salt, and garlic powder together in a medium bowl. Dip each ball in beaten eggs and then in panko mixture.
Place mac and cheese balls into the air fryer basket in a single layer, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn over and fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more.
