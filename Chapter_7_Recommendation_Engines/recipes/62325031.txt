Description: 
I found a modified recipe in the Cowlitz Caravan Cooks book, by Virginia Munger.  Her recipe calls for more graham crackers and the ingredients are layered in a different order. She melts the butter right in the baking pan and then pours the crumbs evenly over the melted butter.  She presses the crumbs slightly.  This saves the hassle of mixing the crackers with the butter and then having to spread it evenly in the bottom of the pan.  HUGE time saver and works every time.Modified from: Magic Cookie Bars from EAGLE BRAND®
