https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 15 oz. cans quartered or sliced artichokes
1 15 oz. can garbanzo beans
1 15 oz. can red kidney beans
2 large cucumbers
2 large tomatoes
8 oz. feta cheese
2 Tbsp. fresh or 2 tsp. dried dill
2 15 oz. cans sliced beets
1/2 cup Wishbone Fat Free Italian salad dressing

Directions:
Open both cans of beans and dump into a colander.  Rinse and drain twice.  Leave in colander.
Peel cucumbers, and wash tomatoes.
Chop the cucumbers and tomatoes into chunks.
Give the colander a shake to remove excess water, and put the beans into a large tupperware bowl.
Drain the artichokes in the colander, and put them into the bowl.
Add the cucumber and tomato, and crumble the feta over the top.
Sprinkle the dill onto the feta cheese.
Drain the beets, but donâ€™t put them into the bowl yet (see steps below).
If this will be served immediately:  Mix in the Italian dressing, put the beets around the side, and serve.
If not serving until later:  Cover and chill the salad until ready to eat, then add the beets and Italian dressing just before serving.

Description: 
I came up with this one day when I was in the mood for a non-traditional tossed salad, and found out my lettuce had gone bad.  I ate the toppings instead, and liked it better!  You can use scoops of this to top a green salad, if you prefer.  The recipe halves nicely, as well.
