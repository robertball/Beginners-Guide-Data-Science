Ingredients:
2 cup Chopped Toasted Nuts (I used cashews)
2 and 1/4 cup Icing Sugar
6 TBSP Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
2 TBSP All-Purpose White Flour
? tsp Salt
3 Egg Whites
1 tsp Vanilla
2 TBSP Grated Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a bowl, thoroughly combine the icing sugar, cocoa powder, flour and salt.
On low speed of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, one at a time, into dry mixture.
Add the vanilla and beat for 1Â½ minutes on high speed, scraping down the sides several times.
Fold in the chopped nuts and chocolate until evenly incorporated.
Scoop the dough onto the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, spacing about 2 inches apart. The smaller the better.
Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, in the middle of the oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until dry on the surface but soft in the center when pressed. Reverse the sheet from front to back halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
Let cookies cool on the sheet for 2 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack. Let cool completely before eating.
