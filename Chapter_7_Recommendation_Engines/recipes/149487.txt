1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/3 cup uncooked converted rice

To make the soup, bring the butter and water to a boil in a large pot. Pour in the contents of the jar and add celery and chicken if using. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes.
