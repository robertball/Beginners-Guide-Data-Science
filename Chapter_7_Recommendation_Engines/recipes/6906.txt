Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups rolled oats
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dried currants
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, salt, and currants. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl, beat egg until frothy, and stir in melted butter and milk. Pour into the well, and mix to create a soft dough. Pat dough into two 1/2 inch thick circles. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Score 8 wedges into each circle of dough.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until risen and browned. Split wedges, and serve warm.
