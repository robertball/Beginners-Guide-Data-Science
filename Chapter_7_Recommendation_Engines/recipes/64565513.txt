Ingredients:
FOR THE CRUST
1 cup cereal flakes with strawberries and chocolate (e.g. Kellogg's Special K)
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup sweetened fancy shred coconut
Â¾-cup maple syrup
FOR THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING
1 package (8 ounces) Neufchatel Cheese
1 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
FOR THE FRUIT
Strawberry Slices
Kiwi Slices
Banana Slices
Blueberries
etc...

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Grease a 9-inch tart pan with baking spray and set aside.
Place cereal in a ziploc bag, close the bag and crush the cereal with a rolling pin.
In a mixing bowl, combine crushed cereal, oats, coconut and maple syrup; stir until completely blended.
Using a buttered spatula, press mixture into previously prepared tart pan.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven and let completely cool. I pop it in the freezer for 15 minutes.
IN the meantime, prepare the cream cheese frosting by combining neufchatel cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla in your mixer's bowl; beat until completely blended and smooth.
Spread frosting over cooled crust.
Place in the fridge for 10 minutes.
Remove from fridge; arrange sliced fruits over frosting, pressing down slightly, and refrigerate for 20 minutes, or until chilled.
Remove rim from tart pan.
Let stand few minutes to make it easier to cut.
Cut and serve.
