Ingredients:
1 cup wild rice
4 cups chicken broth
3 cups cubed, cooked chicken
2 cups seedless red grapes
1 cup roasted salted cashews
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
2 cups mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Bring the wild  rice and chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender but not mushy, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, fluff the rice with a fork, and cook uncovered 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and let the rice cool thoroughly in refrigerator, about 1 hour.
Transfer wild rice to a large salad bowl and toss with cooked chicken, grapes, cashews, and water chestnuts. Whisk mayonnaise, seasoned salt, soy sauce, and curry powder in a separate bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss again. Chill thoroughly, at least 1 hour or overnight for best flavor.

Description: 
Everyone really enjoys this salad; it features wild rice, chicken, and cashews along with plump juicy red grapes. Besides wild rice, the real star of this salad is the dressing that uses curry powder to provide a delicious and unique flavor. And like a lot of dishes, it is best served after sitting overnight to ensure all the flavors get a chance to know each other!!
