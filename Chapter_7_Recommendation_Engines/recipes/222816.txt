2 tablespoons extra-light mayonnaise
1/4 cup low-fat milk
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 head cabbage, finely shredded
1 small onion, minced
1 carrot, shredded and chopped

Directions:
Whisk mayonnaise, low-fat milk, white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, and salt together in a bowl and allow dressing to stand while preparing vegetables, about 20 minutes.
Pour dressing over cabbage, onion, and carrot in a large salad bowl and toss to combine. For best flavor, refrigerate slaw at least 2 hours to overnight.

Description: 
I've been trying to create a coleslaw dressing with the lowest possible fat intake. This is as low as I could go without taking away the flavor. It's a family favorite and we use it with all kinds of meals, in wraps, in sandwiches, with burgers, and as a side during BBQs.
