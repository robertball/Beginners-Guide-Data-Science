Description: 
This vegetarian Mexican casserole is sure to be loved by everyone at the dinner table. With just enough zing from the tomatillos, a little heat from the spices, and tasty crunch from the tortilla chips, we suspect there may not be any leftovers. Feel free to mix in a handful of chopped chicken or cooked ground beef for a little extra protein.
