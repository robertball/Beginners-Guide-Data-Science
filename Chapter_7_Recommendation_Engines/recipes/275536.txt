Ingredients:
1  lemon, zested and juiced
¼ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon grated garlic
3 sprigs fresh parsley
½ teaspoon salt
8  chicken thighs

Directions:
Place lemon zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a large zip-top bag; reserve remaining lemon juice for another use. Add olive oil, garlic, parsley, and salt. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 1 hour to overnight
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Place chicken on the preheated grill and cook, turning once, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 8 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the grill and allow to rest 10 minutes before serving.
