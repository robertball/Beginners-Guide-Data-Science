Ingredients:
1/2 cup of milk
2 tablespoons of sugar
2 tblespoons butter
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F.)
1 pkgs. of active dry yeast
1 egg
2 1/4 cups of bread flour (Separate into 1 1/2 cups and 3/4 cups)

Directions:
Measure the milk in a 2 cup glass measuring cup and place in the microwave for 1 minute- (at high altitude, this took 1 minute 30 seconds in my microwave) As soon as it starts to boil and climb the sides--stop and remove the milk.
Add the butter, sugar & salt to the scalded milk, mix and set aside to cool to lukewarm. (no more than 110ยบ.) Use a kitchen thermometer.
Add the 1/2 cup of warm water 110 ยบ, yeast and 1 tsp. of sugar to a bowl. Proof for 10 minutes.
Add milk mixture to yeast mixture and add 2 cups of flour.
Lightly beat the egg and add to flour mixture.
Mix well with a wooden spoon until smooth.
Add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time-mixing after each addition. When making dough, add flour slowly so you don't add too much flour. You may not need all the flour. I had about 1/4 cup left over.
Dump the dough onto waxed paper sprinkled with flour and lightly knead dough to pull the dough together. The dough will be smooth and a little tacky. Shape into a ball.
Place in an oiled bowl to rise 30 minutes. Cover the bowl with a cloth.
Hints: For rising-use your microwave. Heat a cup of water to steam up the microwave-remove the cup and place the bowl of dough in there to rise.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
To make dinner rolls, first divide dough in thirds. Then, divide dough into 18 pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a ball. Place on a 13x18 inch parchment lined cookie sheet. Makes 18 dinner rolls. Cover and let rise 30 min.
Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes or until browned. 375 for high altitude
If you make hamburger buns they will take around 20-25 minutes.

Description: 
Want a roll that stays soft for days? Try these fluffy, soft rolls made with butter and love. This is my Grandma's recipe. The rolls are quick to rise due to the two packages of yeast. The versatile dough is easily shaped into butterhorns, large hamburger buns, or dinner rolls. A special thanks to Baking Nana for writing the directions that are clear and easy to follow.  This recipe makes 18 large rolls, 24 medium size rolls or 12 Jumbo Hamburger Buns.Modified from: Grandma Rita's Soft Butter Rolls
