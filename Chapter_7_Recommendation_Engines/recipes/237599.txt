Ingredients:
1 pound fettuccine pasta
1 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup frozen peas
2 cups chopped fresh basil
1 cup chopped fresh mint
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional)
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese with herbs
3 scallions (green onions), chopped (optional)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
While fettuccini is boiling, place asparagus and peas into a steamer insert and place insert over the pot of fettuccine. Steam vegetables until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove steamer insert and drain fettuccine.
Combine fettuccine, asparagus, peas, basil, mint, parsley, feta cheese, scallions, and olive oil together in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Mixing herbs like mint and basil with asparagus and peas creates a tasty summer dish. This is one of my favorite things to eat on a hot summer day! Goes great with grilled salmon and a glass of crisp Riesling! Chop herbs in a food processor to speed up your preparation time.
