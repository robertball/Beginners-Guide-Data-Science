Ingredients:
2 cups leftover stuffing
2 cups leftover mashed potatoes
½ cup shredded parmesan
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp poultry seasoning
2 eggs
2 cups Panko bread crumbs
1 qt. oil suitable for frying
1 cup leftover cranberry sauce for dunking

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine stuffing, mashed potatoes, parmesan, seasonings, and eggs.  Gently break apart the stuffing and mix until it’s all combined.  Place Panko bread crumbs in a wide shallow bowl; set aside. Heat oil using a candy thermometer to 350 degrees.  At the same time, working quickly, begin to form two tbsp. sized balls of stuffing mix.  Roll them between your hands to make a round shape, and roll them into the bread crumbs.  Pack the bites firmly with bread crumbs.  When the oil is to temp, drop four bites in at a time and fry until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes.  Place on a cooling rack and sprinkle with sea salt.  Dunk in warmed leftover cranberry sauce!
