Description: 
Lasagna appeals to all of my families eye as well as to their taste buds. Here, ground beef, Italian sausage , onion, garlic, basil, tomatoes and a dash of brown sugar make up the sauce, while Provolone, Parmesan, mozzarella,and parsley are the filling for this layered casserole. Prepare up to 2 days in advance, if desired, and chill covered in the refrigerator until ready to bake. Increase the baking time by about 15 minutes.Modified from: American Lasagna
