Ingredients:
1 cup red quinoa
2 cups water
2 teaspoons ghee
1 cup diced maitake mushrooms
1 1/2 cups diced okra
1/2 cup finely diced shallots
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon dry ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh oregano
3/4 cup finely diced pineapple
1/4 cup diced enoki mushrooms
1 cup vegetable stock
5 eggs, divided
1 teaspoon olive oil
Nonstick olive olive spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9" x 11" baking dish with olive oil and set aside.
Bring quinoa and water to a boil in medium saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer for 12 minutes. Remove from heat, and fluff with a fork.
Melt ghee in large skillet over medium heat.  Add maitake mushrooms, okra, and shallots, and saute for 6 to 7 minutes, until vegetables are slightly tender.
In a small bowl, whisk mustard powder, ginger, garlic, oregano, pineapple, enoki mushrooms, stock, and 1 egg. Toss quinoa with mushroom mixture, and place into prepared baking dish. Pour broth mixture evenly over casserole.  Use a fork to make sure the liquid reaches all corners of the casserole.
Bake for 35 minutes.
Just before removing casserole, fry remaining eggs in olive oil in a skillet, and serve on top of casserole.
Serve warm.
