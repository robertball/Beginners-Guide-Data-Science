Ingredients:
1 tbsp. olive oil
4-6 chicken breast tenders
1/4 c flour
1/4 c cornmeal
1 tsp. saesoning salt
1/4 tsp. pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium high heat.  Mix flour, cornmeal, seasoning salt, and pepper in a shallow dish.  Dredge tenders in flour mixture, shaking off excess.  When oil is very hot, place tenders in the pan.  Cook for about three minutes on each side, or until each side is browned and there is no pink in the middle.  Tenders should be very juicy if not overcooked.  Dip in your favorite barbecue sauce, ketchup, or honey mustard.
