Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar Splenda
1/4 cup (or a little less) of brown sugar Splenda
3 eggs
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups King Arthur Wheat Free flour.
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
3 bananas, mashed to equal one heaping cup
pinches of sugar and cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with butter flavored Pam, then dust lightly with cinnamon and sugar.
In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, white sugar and brown sugar.  Using a mixer, add the eggs,  lemon juice and vanilla and mix until lightly blended.  Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon and mix until well blended and smooth.
Fold in the sour cream, nuts and mashed bananas.  Pour into loaf pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
