Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup pastry flour
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon applesauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.
Combine the all-purpose flour, pastry flour and salt in a bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture and applesauce and knead. Dough shouldn't be sticky, but it shouldn't be dry either. If too sticky add 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour till you get the right consistency. If too dry, add 1 tablespoons of water at a time till you get the right consistency.
Roll out into a rope and cut into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and roll out till it's anywhere from a 6 to 8 inch circle
There are two ways to cook pita bread. The flavor is a bit different with both.   To Bake Pita:  Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and put a pita on a wire cake rack. Toss in the rack and cook for 3 minutes or until the bread stops puffing up. When you take it out, smash down the pita (Careful, its hot!) and quickly put it in a plastic freezer bag.  To Fry Pita:  Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. When almost smoking, place a pita in the pan and cook for a few minutes on each side, till brown spots begin to appear. It should look something like a tortilla when you're done. Put in a plastic bag once it has cooled a bit.

Description: 
You can either bake this bread or fry it. For variety, I like to make four of each.
