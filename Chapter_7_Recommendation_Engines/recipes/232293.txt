Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 cloves garlic
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 cup white wine
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup capers

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir lemon juice and garlic into the oil and cook until the garlic is soft, about 5 minutes. Put chicken into the skillet, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until browned completely, about 5 minutes per side.
Remove chicken from skillet to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to retain moisture. Add chicken broth and white wine to the skillet; bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Stir Parmesan cheese and capers into the liquid mixture; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix bow-tie pasta into sauce; toss to coat. Transfer pasta to a serving bowl.
Return chicken to the skillet. Place a cover on the skillet and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Transfer chicken to a serving platter; serve alongside bow-tie pasta.
