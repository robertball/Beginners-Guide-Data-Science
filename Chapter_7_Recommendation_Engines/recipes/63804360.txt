Ingredients:
1 yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1/2 cup (1  stick) butter, melted
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 pound powdered sugar

Directions:
1. Stir together cake mix, 1 egg, and melted butter to make a smooth dough. Pat into 13x9-inch pan.
2. Beat remaining 2 eggs and softened cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar to make a smooth batter.
3. Bake in preheated 325Â°F oven for 30 to 40 minutes until golden brown and crisp on top. Cream cheese batter may puff significantly in oven but should collapse while cooling.

Description: 
This is an easy-to-make take on a classic St. Louis favorite. There are many stories of where the recipe came from, but one of the most believable is it was invented by a commercial baker who accidentally added too much sugar to a standard cake recipe.
Whatever its origins, this is an INTENSELY sweet dessert, kind of like a lemon bar without the citrus flavor. My family always takes the short cut of using a packaged cake mix to form the crust, and we generally like to garnish it with a simple strawberry sauce (sliced strawberries tossed with a few tablespoons of sugar to draw out their juice)
