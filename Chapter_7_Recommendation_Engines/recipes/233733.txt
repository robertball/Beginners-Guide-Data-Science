Ingredients:
8 cups water
2 (15 ounce) packages black rice (such as LotusÂ® forbidden rice)
Dressing:
1 1/2 cups rice vinegar
3/4 cup tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
1/3 cup sesame oil
1/3 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1/4 cup sriracha sauce
3 tablespoons agave nectar
Salad:
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup roasted unsalted cashews
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 orange bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions
2 tablespoons chopped Thai basil
2 tablespoons chopped purple basil
1 jalapeno pepper, minced

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer rice to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, and cool until just warm.
Whisk rice vinegar, tamari, sesame oil, mirin, sriracha sauce, and agave nectar together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over cooled rice; stir.
Stir carrots, cashews, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, scallions, Thai basil, purple basil, and jalapeno into rice until evenly distributed.
