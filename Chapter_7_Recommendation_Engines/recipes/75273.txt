Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can Lindsay® Black Ripe Pitted Olives, drained, finely chopped
1/4 cup light mayonnaise
3 tablespoons drained sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, chopped
3 tablespoons green onion, chopped
3 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
3 tablespoons pine nuts
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
12 slices firm white sandwich bread
6 tablespoons light cream cheese

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except bread and cream cheese; mix well. Cover; chill at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours before assembling sandwiches. Cut crusts from bread forming 4-inch squares; reserve crusts for another use. Spread cream cheese over bread. Spread olive mixture over 6 slices bread; close sandwiches with remaining bread, pressing lightly. Cut diagonally in half or lengthwise into rectangles.
