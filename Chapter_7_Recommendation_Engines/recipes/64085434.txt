Ingredients:
1/2 cup chilled coconut milk
1 cup fresh spinach leaves
10 leaves fresh mint, chopped
1/4 cup raw cacao seeds
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
1 (1 gram) packet stevia powder
1 banana, cut into pieces and frozen
ice, or as needed
water, or as needed

Directions:
Blend coconut milk, spinach, mint leaves, cacao seeds, peppermint extract, and stevia powder in a blender. While blender is running, drop in banana chunks, one by one. Add ice cubes until smoothie has desired thickness, and water if smoothie is too thick.
**After viewer comments, I've reduced the extract to 1/4 teaspoon (from the original 1 teaspoon).  Feel free to ad more to taste!
