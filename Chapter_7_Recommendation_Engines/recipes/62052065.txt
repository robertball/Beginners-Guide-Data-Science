Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my Italian Mother-in-Law.  It is the type of crustless cheesecake that is sold in Italian bakeries in New York. I usually make it with whole milk ricotta which is creamier than low fat.  This is not a diet item!  You can add fresh fruit topping if you desire.
