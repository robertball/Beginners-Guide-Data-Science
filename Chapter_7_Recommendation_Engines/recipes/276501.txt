Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon anise extract
cooking spray
1/4 cup powdered sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat a pizzelle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Beat eggs, sugar, and butter together using an electric mixer. Add flour and extracts; beat until combined.
Spray the inside of iron lightly with cooking spray.
Drop batter by teaspoonfuls into the center of each pizzelle grid. Close lid and bake until steam stops and cookies are light golden brown, 45 to 60 seconds.
Peel pizzelle off using a fork and lay flat on a newspaper. Sprinkle with powdered sugar while warm and let sit for 1 minute. Dust the other side. Repeat with remaining batter to make about 30 cookies.
