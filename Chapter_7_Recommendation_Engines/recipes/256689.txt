Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
8 cups vegetable broth
1 cup lentils
2 cups chopped Russian kale, or more to taste
2 cups chopped Swiss chard, or more to taste
2 cups chopped mustard greens, or more to taste
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons thyme
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until soft, about 3 minutes. Pour in vegetable broth. Increase heat to high and bring broth to a boil. Add lentils. Reduce heat to medium and cook until soft, about 45 minutes.
Stir kale, Swiss chard, and mustard greens into the broth; simmer until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in nutritional yeast, garlic powder, thyme, pepper, and salt. Let soup cool, about 10 minutes.
Transfer soup to a blender; puree until smooth. Pour back into the pot and reheat, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is the kind of soup to make when you find yourself with too many greens and need a vitamin-packed alternative to yet another salad. We ate the stew plain with crusty bread as well as served over rice, and enjoyed it both ways.
