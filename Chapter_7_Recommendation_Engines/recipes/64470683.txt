Sausage and Pepper Pie Recipe

Ingredients:
2 pkgs (12 oz) large-size crescent rolls (8 rolls in a pkg)
8 oz mozzarella (shredded or sliced)
6 slices aged Provolone
1 lb cooked Italian sausage*
1 cup thinly sliced green bell pepper
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 tbs olive oil
2 tbs parmesan cheese

Directions:
*Hot, sweet or specially flavored is fine. If you're using links, cut into 1/4-inch slices. If using bulk sausage, brown and drain.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large (15 x 10-inch) baking sheet with parchment.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Saute the bell pepper and onions about 5 minutes, or until the onion turns translucent.
Pat one package (do NOT separate into individual rolls) of the crescent roll dough into a rectangle on prepared baking sheet, sealing seams.
Layer the cheeses on top of the roll dough. Spread the sausage evenly over the cheese. Spread peppers and onions over the sausage.
Open remaining rolls--again do NOT separate. Lay them across the top of the "pie" sealing seams and ends as best you can--it's OK if it looks a bit "rustic."
Sprinkle parmesan cheese on the top "crust."
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until roll dough is golden brown.
