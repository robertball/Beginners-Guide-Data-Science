Ingredients:
2½  to 3½  pound boneless chuck roast
1 jar of sandwich sliced kosher dill pickles
3 whole bay leaves
salt and pepper to taste
½ cup finely crushed ginger snaps
¼ cup light cream or half and half OR ¼ cup plain yogurt or sour cream
1 pound thin egg noodles, dried spaezel, or mini gnocchi

Directions:
Spray the liner of a large crock pot with PAM non-stick spray.  Season the roast to taste with salt and black pepper.  Place the roast in the slow cooker.  Lay all of the dill pickle slices evenly over that top of the seasoned roast.  Pour all of the pickle brine in the slow cooker--pour along the side of the roast, not over the top.  Cover and cook on low for 8 hours.
At the end of 8 hours, carefully remove the roast to another dish.  Wisk the cream and crushed ginger snaps into broth.  Gently pull apart the pickles and roast into 1 to 2 inch pieces.  Carefully return the meat and pickles to the creamy broth.  Add the cooked and drained noodles or spaezels.  GENTLY stir until lightly mixed.  Serve hot.
