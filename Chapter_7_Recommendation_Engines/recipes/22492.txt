Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Cocoa Powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
decorating icing in tube or can

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 F.
Beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla in large bowl on medium speed of mixer until creamy.  Add eggs; beat well.  Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; gradually add to butter mixture, beating until well blended.
Drop dough by slightly heaping 1/4 cupfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet, about 3 inches apart (put only 4 on a cookie sheet).  Shape into balls.  With palm of hand, flatten to 3-1/2-inch rounds.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until set.  (Cookies will spread during baking; baked cookies will be about 5 inches in diameter.)  Cool 3 minutes; using a wide spatula, carefully remove from cookie sheet to wire rack.  Cool completely.
Make a pattern of child's hand on paper, with fingers spread.  Cut out the pattern; place pattern on cookie.  Using pattern as a guide, outline hand with icing; repeat with remaining cookies.  Garnish if desired.  12 to 14 cookies.
