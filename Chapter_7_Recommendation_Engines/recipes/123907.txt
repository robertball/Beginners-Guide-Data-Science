Ingredients:
4 cups sliced peeled ripe peaches
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 (9 inch) deep dish unbaked pie shell

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine peaches, sugar, tapioca and lemon juice; let stand 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine flour, brown sugar and pecans in a small bowl; cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle 1/3 of crumbs over bottom of pie shell; cover with peach mixture. Sprinkle remaining crumbs on top, allowing peaches to show if desired. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F and bake 20 minutes longer or until peaches are tender and topping is golden brown.

Description: 
Peach pie is typical of our state, and this recipe includes typically Southern praline topping. It was given to me when I married and set up our home more than 40 years ago. I can and freeze peaches to make this pie year-round.
