Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package frozen mixed berries
4 small apples - peeled, cored, and chopped

1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup solid coconut oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine frozen mixed berries, apples, cornstarch, and vanilla extract in a bowl and transfer to a baking dish.
Combine flour, oats, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix in coconut oil with your fingers until you have a crumbly dough. Sprinkle over the fruit in the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until crumble is lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite vegan desserts that takes very little time and effort. In order to make the crumble topping vegan, I use coconut oil instead of butter. The coconut oil must be solid so you might need to put it in the fridge for a while to harden up.
