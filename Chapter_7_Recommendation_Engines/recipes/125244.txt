Description: 
'Fresh tasting...so colorful...delicious dressing' are some of the compliments I get whenever I serve this broccoli salad with a meal or take it to a church dinner. Although I use many other good salad recipes, I'm especially fond of this one.                           --Esther Shank, Harrisonville, Virginia
