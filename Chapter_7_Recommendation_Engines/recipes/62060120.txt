Description: 
My italian sister-in-law turned me onto tiramisu over 20 years agos.This is a very traditional recipe of tiramisu that I came up with from about 4 other recipes and I have been making this version for many years. The eggs are cooked which makes this safe.  I'm told to bring this all the time to our friends when we go over for dinner.  A local restaurant owner had mine and asked if I would supply her as it was better than she was getting from her cake supplier.  This is even better the next day as the flavours meld together, so make it early.
