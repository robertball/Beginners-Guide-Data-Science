Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup (I use 98% fat free or Healthy Request by Campbell's)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup (98% fat free by Campbell's)
1 can low sodium chicken broth
1 large onion, finely diced
3 carrots, chopped
4 stalks of celery, chopped
1 tsp poultry seasoning
.5 tsp dried rosemary
pinch of salt
pinch of pepper
1 (10 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough, torn into pieces

Directions:
While chopping up the onion, carrots, and celery, place the chicken in a bowl with the poultry seasoning, the salt and pepper and a little water.
Pour half the can of low sodium chicken broth into the bottom of the crock pot.
Put the chicken breasts into the crock pot along with the water and seasonings from the bowl.
Layer the onions, carrots, and celery on top of the chicken.
Add the butter.
Add the condensed soups and then the remaining chicken broth.
