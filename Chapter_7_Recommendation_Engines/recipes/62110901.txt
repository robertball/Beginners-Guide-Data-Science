Ingredients:
2 Tbls flour
3 Tbls butter
1 1/2 tsp yellow mustard
3 tsp worchestershire sauce
1 can evaporated milk
1 10 oz block extra sharp white cheddar (like Crackerbarrel) cheese, shredded
Just less than a 16 oz box of elbow pasta

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*.
Cook elbow macaroni according to box directions (drain and set aside).
While pasta is cooking, melt the butter in a medium bowl.
Combine butter w/all of the ingredients (EXCEPT the cheese) and microwave for 3 minutes, checking/stirring regularly as to not burn (cook time WILL vary w/microwave).
Add cheese to thickened white sauce and microwave for 1 minute at 70% power (if cheese isn't completely melted upon stirring, microwave a little longer).
Mix white sauce and pasta in a round 2 quart casserole dish...here's where mom and I differ.  I prefer to serve now, all saucy and gooey while *mom prefers to bake for 20-30 minutes in the oven at 350 (until top is browned).
