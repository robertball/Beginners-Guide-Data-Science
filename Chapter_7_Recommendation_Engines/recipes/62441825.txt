Ingredients:
It is not necessary to be EXACT with the measurements, but the relative percentages should be roughly maintained.
***
- 8 ½ to 9 pounds (4 kilos) of Ripe Tomatoes (we need the juice!)
- 5 ounces (140 grams) fresh celery, cleaned, quite roughly chopped
- 7 ounces (200 grams) fresh fennel, cleaned, roughly chopped
- just under 2 ounces (50 gms) peeled shallots, chopped but not TOO finely
- just under 1 ounce (24 gms) peeled and sliced garlic cloves
- ¼ ounce (8 gms) - small bunch - fresh thyme
- ¾ ounce (20 gms) - small to mediumish bunch - fresh basil, roughly torn
- ¾ ounce (20 gms) - 2 teaspoons - salt
- just under 3 ounces (80 gms) - 2 ⅔ Tablespoons - sugar (but I don't know how sweet your tomatoes are!)
- ½ to 1 pinch cayenne
- 2 to 4 grams - ½ to 1 teaspoon - Worcester sauce
- 2 to 4 grams - ½ to 1 teaspoon - Tabasco
***
You will also need 3 or 4 big sheets of cook's muslin/cheesecloth - or use a CLEAN (!) undyed bedsheet folded to be 4 thicknesses.

Directions:
In a deep pan (stock pot is perfect) crush the tomatoes roughly but thoroughly, so that each tomato is crushed to some degree. If the tomatoes are cherry toms, then halving them is sufficient.
Add all the remaining ingredients and stir well to mix together. Leave, covered, to marinate for a while, this can be as long as overnight or as short as 10 minutes! Longer is better of course - I recommend a good 3 hrs, but was taught that 6 hrs is a minimum! I once left it for 18 hours - still good!
Line a large bowl with your cloth(s) and pour the contents of the stock pot into the cloth. (If it doesn't all fit in, then fill only as much as you can handle and not slop around!)
In a cool place (pantry, garage, basement, wherever, place the bowl under the position from which you are about to hang the cloth parcel.
Gather up the corners of the cloth (add any remaining mixture from the stock pot) and tie the bundle up securely (we don't want any insects getting in!) before suspending it over the bowl.
NEVER TWIST THE BAG NOR SQUEEZE IT IN ANY WAY, as that will turn your Essence cloudy.
Allow to drip overnight - minimum 1 hour, until no longer dripping freely, but leaving longer is OK, but not for longer than &frac12; a day.

This freezes very well and adds stunning notes to all sorts of dishes (see the footnotes). I most often serve it as a chilled soup, just a coffee cup full per person. Drip just 2 or so droplets of EVOO onto the surface and garnish with fresh Basil leaves. Serve with breadsticks, or bread cubes. (The easiest way is to just pour it into the mouth - like drinking, but you can faff around with teaspoons if you like). I never tell my guests what it is, and ask them to guess. Hardly anyone guesses right, but they all go "Of Course!" when I tell them!

Description: 
A stunning, clear, golden liquid with so many uses. Perfect for dealing with a glut from the garden. It freezes really well too. You can easily halve the quantities or even quarter them! (Or double or quadruple them!) And you are involved for maybe 15 minutes, no more! My version of a Raymond Blanc original.
