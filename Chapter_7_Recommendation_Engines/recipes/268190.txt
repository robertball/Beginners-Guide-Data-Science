Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 cup water
1/4 cup chili powder
1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon adobo seasoning (such as Savory Spice® Lodo Red Adobo)
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Combine beef and diced tomatoes in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Unlock and remove lid, switch to saute mode. Cook until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and water. Add chili powder, chipotle powder, garlic salt, adobo seasoning, paprika, and onion powder and stir to combine. Serve immediately.
