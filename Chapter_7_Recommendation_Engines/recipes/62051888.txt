Ingredients:
4 - Boneless, skinless chicken breasts butterflied
1 - 8 oz. block of Monterray Jack cheese or Monterray Jack with jalepanos
5 - Jars Salsa Verde
1 pkg. bacon slices
2 cans whole kernel corn drained
2 cans sliced mushrooms drained
8 -10 toothpicks

Directions:
Pour Salsa Verde, mushrooms and corn in a large pot. Heat on medium heat until simmering. Stir occasionally. You may use as much or as little salsa verde, mushrooms and corn as you like. Just remember to leave room for the chicken.
While you wait for the salsa to simmer butterfly the chicken.
Cut the Cheese into cubes and wrap them in the chicken. You can use as much cheese as you can fit. Secure the wrapped chicken with toothpicks.
Wrap a slice of bacon around the chicken using the toothpicks already there to secure it. Put any leftover bacon in the pot of salsa.
When the salsa mixture is simmering carefully place the wrapped chicken in the sauce.  Allow chicken to cook about 25 minutes or until cooked through. Turn the chicken after about 15 minutes.
Serve with sour cream and baked potatoes if desired.
