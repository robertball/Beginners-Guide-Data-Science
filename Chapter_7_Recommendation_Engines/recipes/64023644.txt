Ingredients:
1/3 cup sweet mango chutney
1 tbsp. grainy Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp. sweet Thai chili sauce
1 kg. flat boneless smoked fully cooked ham (bring to room temperature first)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 F.
Combine chutney, mustard and chili sauce for glaze.
Pat ham dry with paper towels, and place on a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to score the top of the ham in a cross-hatch pattern.
Brush glaze over ham and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, or until glaze is caramelized and ham has reached an internal temperature of 155 F to 160 F. Let stand 10 minutes, then slice against the grain.
