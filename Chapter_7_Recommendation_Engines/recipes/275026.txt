Description: 
Mashed potatoes that could be a meal. Hardy, filling, and savory. I started making mashed potatoes this way mainly for my daughter who loves loaded baked potatoes. The first time I tried this was because we were having company for dinner and I was running low on potatoes. It was the hit of the dinner. About a year after I started making them this way, we went to a restaurant that had a similar offering. My daughter said mine was still better.
