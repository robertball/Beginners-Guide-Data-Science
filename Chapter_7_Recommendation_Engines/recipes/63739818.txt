Ingredients:
2-3 sweet potatoes
1 tbsp. cornstarch
2 tbsp. olive oil
Salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder to taste

Directions:
Peel, slice, then cut potatoes into uniform, 1/4 to 1/2 inch "French fry" shapes. Rinse in cool water, drain and rinse again. Dry the potatoes very thoroughly.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
Place the fries in a zip lock bag with cornstarch, shaking to coat. Place fries out on a non-stick baking sheet. Drizzle with oil to coat, but not saturate. Take care not to knock the cornstarch off. Sprinkle with seasoning to taste.
Place in preheated oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven and turn them over. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until done.
