Ingredients:
16 slices of bread
6 whole eggs
5 cups milk
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 c. sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1 c. dried cranberries (@Craisins)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease or spray an 8 x 12 pan.
Break/tear bread into 1" pieces directly into baking pan.
Beat eggs in medium-sized bowl with fork.  Add remaining ingredients except dried cranberries and beat well.  Pour carefully over all bread.  Using rubber spatula, gently move pieces of bread, turning to assure all is moistened.  (Take care not to "mix or mash" bread and milk mixture.)  Sprinkle with dried cranberries, gently folding in with spatula, evenly covering baking pan.
Place in oven.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned on top.
Remove from oven.  Cut into squares and serve immediately with syrup, butter, jam or cinnamon/sugar topping.
