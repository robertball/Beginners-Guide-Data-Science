Description: 
My mother-in-law gave all her girls a fund-raising cookbook. Unfortunately, mine walked out my door )= But I had made this recipe often enough that it stuck with me. I use light ingredients to make it diet friendly. Because we had the same book, my sister-in-law and I made this for the same Father's Day function one year (= This is a favorite at work . . .
