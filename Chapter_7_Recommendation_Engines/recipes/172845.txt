Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 bunch rainbow chard - leaves and stems separated and chopped
1/3 cup chopped yellow onion
2 (1/4 inch thick) slices fresh ginger root, peeled and julienned
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chopped chard stems, onion, and ginger in the hot oil until they begin to soften; season with salt and pepper. Add the chopped chard leaves to the skillet; reduce heat to low. Continue cooking until the leaves have wilted, about 2 minutes more. Drizzle the maple syrup over the mixture; stir to coat evenly. Remove from heat and serve.

Description: 
This super-fast recipe is the exact opposite of the traditional chard and vinegar that I grew up on and grew tired of. Mildly sweet with a gingery bite.
