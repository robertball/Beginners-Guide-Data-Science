Ingredients:
5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 pounds cabbage, chopped
3 tablespoons mayonnaise, or more if needed
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth, or as needed
salt and black pepper to taste
2 pounds cubed fully cooked ham

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
While potatoes are boiling, place cabbage into a pot with about an inch of water, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer the cabbage until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the cabbage, and set aside.
In a large bowl, mash the potatoes and mayonnaise together, adding chicken broth by the tablespoon until you reach your desired consistency. Season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper. Stir the cabbage into the mashed potatoes.
Place the cooked ham into a skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir until the ham is hot, about 3 minutes. Stir the cooked ham into the colcannon, and serve.

Description: 
I remember watching a cooking show and hearing of this awesome Irish meal, and so I changed it to fit my own needs and likes/dislikes. I love it and my boyfriend gets very excited when we get to make this dish! It's not only easy, but it's great as a leftover too! Garlic-flavored chicken broth works very well in this recipe.
