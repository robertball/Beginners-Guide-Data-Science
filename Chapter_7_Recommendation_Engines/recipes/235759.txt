Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups diced celery
1 1/2 cups diced carrots
1 cup diced onion
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 bay leaf
3 cups beef stock
3 cups chicken stock
2 cups roasted white turkey meat
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup rotini pasta

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; saute celery, carrots, onion, parsley, and bay leaf until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add beef stock, chicken stock, turkey, salt, and pepper to vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot with a lid, and simmer until soup is heated through, about 15 minutes.
Stir rotini into soup and cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe comes from a number of years of playing in the kitchen. I find that the addition of beef stock to the recipe adds depth to a usually bland soup. Any type of pasta can be used.
