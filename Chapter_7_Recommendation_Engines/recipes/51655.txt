Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, sliced
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 cup chopped onion
3 1/2 cups chicken stock
3/4 cup 2% milk
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add carrots, and cook just until tender. Drain, and return the carrots to the pan. Set aside.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion and garlic to the saucepan with the carrots, and pour in chicken stock. Turn heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 25 minutes to blend flavors.
Puree the carrot mixture in a food processor or blender, in small batches if necessary. Return to the saucepan, and stir in the milk, dill and chives. Cook just until heated through, and serve.
