Ever want to take that restaurant flavor back home, sharing bread with friends and family?!!  Here it is-the real deal and I am not telling!!!!  A little bit goes a long way since the spices are so powerful and the oil makes it smooth for dipping!! This also can be used for garlic toast-butter bread and sprinkle it on or on your favorite meats!! Very simple!!
