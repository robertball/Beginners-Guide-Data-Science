Ingredients:
2 eggs, separated
1 3/4 cups warm milk
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons honey
1 1/4 cups cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup corn
2 green chile peppers, seeded and minced, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Beat egg whites in a large bowl until fluffy. Fold in milk, butter, and honey. Add cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt, stirring slowly until batter is smooth. Fold in corn and green chile peppers.
Scoop some batter onto waffle iron; cook until golden brown and crisp or until waffle iron stops steaming, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
This hearty and spicy cornmeal waffle can be eaten any time of day and is a nice substitute for cornbread when it's too hot out to use your oven. You can also add thinly diced onions or red pepper flakes to the batter if you wish. I like to serve these with jalapeno jelly for breakfast or chili for dinner, and sometimes I eat them with barbeque sauce slathered on top.
