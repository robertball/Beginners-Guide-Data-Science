5 carrots, sliced

In large, heavy pot, combine cream of chicken soup, water, chicken, celery, onion, salt, poultry seasoning, and pepper. Cover and cook over low heat about 1 1/2 hours.
Add carrots; cover and cook another 30 minutes.
Remove chicken from pot, shred it, and return to pot. Add dumplings.
