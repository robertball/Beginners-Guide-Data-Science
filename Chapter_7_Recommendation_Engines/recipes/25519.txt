Ingredients:
1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half
1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained and flaked
1/4 cup duck sauce

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Spread the bacon on a large baking sheet. Place a small mound of crabmeat at one end of each half slice of bacon. Roll bacon around the crabmeat, securing with toothpicks, if necessary.
Broil the rolled bacon 10 minutes, turning it once to ensure even browning, until evenly crisp and browned. Drain on paper towels and serve warm with duck sauce.
