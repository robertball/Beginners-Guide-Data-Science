Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon butter
1 (6 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms
1/4 cup French-fried onions
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1/3 cup white wine
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 beef bouillon cube
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
3/4 pound cooked steak, thinly sliced
1/4 cup milk, or as needed
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
Heat olive oil and butter together in a large frying pan; cook and stir mushrooms, onions, and garlic in the oil-butter mixture until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir cream cheese, white wine, tomato paste, lemon juice, cornstarch, beef bouillon, parsley, seasoned salt, and paprika together in a bowl; add steak. Pour cream cheese mixture into frying pan with mushroom mixture; cook and gently stir mixture over low heat just until sauce is warmed and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Add enough milk to reach desired consistency.
Pour sauce over pasta and toss to coat. Season with black pepper.

Description: 
I created this recipe as a way to use leftover filet mignon steak from a New Year's dinner. Hubby really liked it and said I needed to write it down so he could have it again sometime. I hope you will enjoy this great comfort food!
