Ingredients:
3-4 medium Zuchinni, cut into "spears" the size of "steak french fries"
1-1/4 cup unwhipped whole Cream
Pinch of Ground Nutmeg
1 cup grated fresh Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cut zuchinnis into wedges the size of "steak fries".   Plunk into a shallow 9 x 12" oven baking dish. Mix nutmeg with cream. Pour cream over zuchinni in shallow baking pan.  Spread grated Paremsan evenly on top.  Bake at 350 deg. F. for 35 - 45 min., until cream forms a custard and somewhat "solidifies" around zuchinni. If desired broil for 2 or 3 min. until top is golden brown and bubbly.  Remove and let cool slightly to "set" more. Goes well with any roasted or cooked meats or poultry.  Great for potlucks.

Description: 
A Fabulous side dish or zuchinni spears cooked with cream and Parmesan cheese.  The cream forms a sweet custard, offset by the salty Parmesan cheese.  Even Zuchinni haters LOVE this dish! Simple, elegant, goes with everything.  I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe for this, even from people who dislike zuchinni!   Try it...
