https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup rye flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
3/4 cup powdered non-fat milk
1 tbsp. dried parsley
1/3 cup natural style creamy peanut butter (no salt added)
1 tbsp. peanut oil
1/2 cup turkey or chicken broth, hot

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients in a medium bowl.
Add parsley, peanut butter and peanut oil.
Stir together with a fork, pressing to distribute peanut butter throughout mixture.
Add broth and mix until dry ingredients are moistened and a thick dough is formed.
Transfer to floured surface and knead about 5 minutes or until dough is well-blended (Dough will not be extremely smooth).
Roll to about 1/2" thickness and cut into shapes with desired cookie cutter; knead together scraps, roll and cut remaining dough into shapes.
Place up to 6 biscuits on a microwave-safe plate; microwave on high for 4 minutes*.
Flip biscuits over and microwave on high, checking frequently, an additional 3 to 6 minutes or until dry, firm and lightly browned.
Allow to cool completely before serving to your dog.  (Preparation time includes 10 minutes cooling time)
*Note:  This recipe was created using a 5" dog bone shaped cookie cutter.  If making smaller treats, or rolling dough thinner than 1/2", reduce initial microwave time to about 3 minutes, then check treats every 1 minute to ensure they do not burn.

Description: 
Microwave cooking helps dry and harden these dog treats, making them not only a tasty, healthy treat but a great part of our dog's dental care.
