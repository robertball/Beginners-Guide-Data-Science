Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, tomato paste, hot pepper sauce, chicken bouillon, and paprika. Pour in half of the ale; simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Pour remaining ale into the skillet; add shrimp. Season with salt. Cook until shrimp absorbs the liquid and turns pink, 15 to 20 minutes.
