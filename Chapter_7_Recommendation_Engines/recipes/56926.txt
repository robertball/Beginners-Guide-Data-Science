Ingredients:
1 cup fish sauce
3/4 cup rice vinegar
3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 dried red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the fish sauce, rice vinegar, water, sugar, garlic powder and chile pepper. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Taste to make sure the sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavors are balanced and adjust if necessary. Pour into bottles and seal with lids.

Submitter: 
BALISAL
Description: 
A dipping sauce for rice rolls and for barbecued chicken, beef, pork or fish. Perfect for salads as is, or mix with a little vegetable oil. Make smaller quantities with lime or lemon juice but refrigerate as this will not last as the rice vinegar version does.
