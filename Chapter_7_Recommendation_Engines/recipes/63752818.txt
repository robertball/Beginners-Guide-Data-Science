Ingredients:
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon minced green onion
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
2 cucumbers

Directions:
Using a zester, vegetable peeler or fork, score the length of each cucumber to create a striped effect.
Remove the ends and cut each cucumber into 3/4 inch rounds.
Using a melon baller, scoop out the seeds from the center of each round to form a cup.
Reserve 1 tbsp of the walnuts as a garnish.
Combine remaining ingredients and stir until well blended.
Spoon the mixture into the cucumber cups, garnish with the remaining nuts and chill until serving time.
