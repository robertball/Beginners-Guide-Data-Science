Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk of choice + 2 tablespoons, divided
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups butternut squash puree
1 large egg
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Soak the oats in 1/2 cup milk for 5 minutes to soften.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the butternut squash puree, egg, brown sugar, and maple syrup.
Stir the oat and milk mixture into dry ingredients. Form a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredient mixture. Lightly whisk together. Gently fold the butter and remaining milk into the batter.
Grease or line the cups of your muffin pans and divide the batter evenly amongst the 12 tins.
Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the domes are peaked and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
