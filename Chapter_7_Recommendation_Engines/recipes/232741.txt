Description: 
A delightful wasabi dressing that I whipped up for coleslaw for Memorial Day but could be used in a vast variety of creations. If you want to increase the heat, add more wasabi or add red chili flakes. This can be used as a dressing, marinade, or dip. The possibilities are endless. Fish tacos, anyone?
