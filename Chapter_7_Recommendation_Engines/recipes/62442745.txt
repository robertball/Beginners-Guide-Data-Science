https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 egg, beaten
1 cup self-rising cornmeal mix
1 large yellow squash (or zucchini), grated
1 small onion, grated
1 tsp. onion powder (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional add-ins: garlic powder, minced or grated jalapeno (pickled or fresh), aleppo pepper (or other pepper flakes), cayenne pepper.

Directions:
Mix the egg and the cornmeal mix.
Incorporate the squash along with any squash juice that has accumulated, and season WELL (this mixture will seem dry at first).
Drop by large spoonfuls, forming patties, into a preheated cast iron skillet containing 1/4 to 1/2 inch of hot peanut oil.
Cook over medium high heat until dark brown (to ensure centers are cooked), turning once.

Description: 
Quite a lot like hush puppies, but made with grated summer squash.  The squash makes them moist and tender on the inside, and the cornmeal mix makes them crisp and brown on the outside.  These are delicious with fish (of course), chicken, and other grilled meats.
