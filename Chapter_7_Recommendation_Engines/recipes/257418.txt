Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix (such as Betty CrockerÂ®)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
3 tablespoons water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 bananas, thinly sliced
10 strawberries, thinly sliced, or more to taste
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a pizza pan with parchment paper.
Stir brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water in a bowl until well blended. Spread on the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely, about 15 minutes.
Mix crushed pineapple, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Spread over cooled brownie.
Arrange banana and strawberry slices over cream cheese layer. Drizzle chocolate syrup and sprinkle peanuts on top. Cut "pizza" into slices.
