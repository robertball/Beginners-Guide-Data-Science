Description: 
A delicious Asian-inspired noodle salad that is perfect for summer and especially wonderful at picnics or cook-outs.  You can use asparagus rather than the peapods (as my grandmother does), if you wish.  Water Chestnuts are also a delicious addition, if you so desire.  Sure to be a favorite!
