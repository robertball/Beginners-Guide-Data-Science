Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
3/4 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
1 (16 ounce) package dry small curd cottage cheese
3 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons sour cream
1 egg yolk
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, or as needed, divided

Directions:
Beat eggs in a bowl. Add milk, oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Beat in flour using an electric mixer until well blended. Let batter stand for 15 to 30 minutes.
Mix the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, cottage cheese, sugar, sour cream, egg yolk, and cinnamon together in a bowl to make the filling.
Melt butter in a 6- to 7-inch skillet. Spoon a portion of the batter onto the skillet; cook until lightly browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn out onto a tea towel. Repeat with the remaining batter, thinning with small amounts of water if necessary and greasing the pan after every 2 to 3 blintzes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Melt the remaining butter in the skillet over low heat, about 1 minute.
Place a blintz on a clean work surface with the uncooked side up. Add 1 tablespoon filling and roll up, completely covering the filling. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining blintzes. Brush filled blintzes with melted butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until brown, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This traditional family recipe tastes great. Blintzes may be wrapped and frozen after filling and before baking. Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream and strawberry (or other) preserves.
