Ingredients:
3/4lb elbow macaroni
Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
1.5 cups heavy cream
1 cup half & half
1 cup whole milk
2 large eggs
½ tsp. Nutmeg
¼ tblsp kosher salt (I use sea salt)
¼ tsp fresh ground white pepper (I use black)
1.5 cups x-tra sharp cheddar cheese (4oz.)
1.5 cups (your choice) cheese (think Fontana, Asiago, etc.)
1.5 cups (another choice) cheese
4 oz. Cold cream cheese cut into ½ in. cubes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the macaroni for 3 minutes (it will still be chewy). Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and toss well.
Butter a 10x15 baking dish. In a large bowl, whisk the heavy cream with the half & half, milk, eggs, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Stir in the shredded cheeses and the pasta. Spread the mac and cheese in the baking dish and scatter the cream cheese on top.
Bake for 5 minutes. Using the back of a large spoon, spread the melted cream cheese cubes evenly over the surface. Bake for 40 minutes, until bubbling.
Remove the baking dish from the oven and preheat the broiler. Broil about 3 inches from the heat source until richly browned (about 2 minutes). Let the mac & cheese stand for at least 10 minutes before serving.
