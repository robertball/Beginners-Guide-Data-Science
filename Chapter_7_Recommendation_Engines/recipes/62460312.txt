Ingredients:
1 egg yolk at room temperature
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp. salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tsp. lemon juice
1 tsp.cold water
3/4 cup neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn, or extra virgin olive oil, or a combination

Directions:
Whisk together the yolk , mustard, salt, pepper and lemon juice and water by hand or in a food processor (double recipe) until frothy. While it's running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream.  When an emulsion forms you can add it a little faster. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. A mixer can also be used.
