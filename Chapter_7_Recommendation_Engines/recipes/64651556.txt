Ingredients:
Bento-style lunch container
Basic Chicken Salad
Cucumber, sliced vertically, about 1/8" thick
Wooden Toothpicks
Carrot Sticks
Green Bell Pepper Strips
Cherry Tomatoes
5 Greek Olives, drained
1/2 cup pineapple pieces

Directions:
Make Basic Chicken Salad, http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8499/basic-chicken-salad/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%201, finely chopping all ingredients to a spreadable consistency.
Blot cucumber slices dry, then spread a thin layer of chicken salad on one slice.  Roll up the slice with the chicken salad inside, jelly-roll style, and secure with a toothpick.  Repeat for as many rolls as desired.
Place carrot sticks and  green bell pepper strips in one division of a Bento-style lunch carrier, pineapple pieces in another.
In a separate container, place the cucumber roll-ups, and fill in around the roll-ups with cherry tomatoes, as many as you like.  Olives may be placed in a separate container, if desired.
Snap the pieces together and go!  Refrigerate until ready to serve.
