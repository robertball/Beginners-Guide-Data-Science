Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3-4 pounds cut up chicken with skin
1 large bunch whole carrots, peeled
1 large bunch celery, trimmed
3 medium white onions, whole
1 parsnip, peeled (optional)
1 bag fine egg noodles
salt and pepper to taste
Don't be afraid to add more veggies if that's to your taste!

Directions:
Put all ingredients except noodles, salt and pepper in large pot.  Fill with water to cover + 2 inches.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 hours.  Skim off the fat that will float to the top somewhere in there.  If you need to add more liquid or more veggies, go ahead and do it.
Make the egg noodles according to package directions.  (You can also try matzah balls, won-tons or dumplings with this recipe.)  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve noodles, chicken pieces (best if you take them off the bone in the kitchen) and whole cooked vegetables in the amazing broth.

Description: 
This is my mother's recipe.  No canned ingredients and it's about as from-scratch as you can get.  It's the best chicken soup I've ever had.
