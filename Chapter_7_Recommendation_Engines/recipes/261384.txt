Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 (7 ounce) box Spanish yellow rice mix (such as Goya®)
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 cup diced onion
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 tablespoon sweet and spicy seafood seasoning (such as McCormick®)
1/2 cup fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add rice mix and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Boil for 1 minute; cover and reduce heat. Simmer until water is absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Heat remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until just soft, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and seafood seasoning. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are bright pink, about 5 minutes.
Mound rice on each plate; top with a portion of the pepper-shrimp mixture and a generous sprinkling of parsley.

Description: 
I created this recipe to replicate paella for a crowd. I love paella, but it's expensive and not everyone likes the mussels and sausage in it. Serve this dish with a good Spanish wine and some bread and oil and it will be a sure crowd-pleaser!
