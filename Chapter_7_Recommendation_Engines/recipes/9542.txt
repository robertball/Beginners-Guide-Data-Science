Ingredients:
1 (7.25 ounce) package white frosting mix
1/3 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup boiling water
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Line a 10x15 inch cookie sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Set aside.
Beat frosting mix, corn syrup, vanilla, and boiling water in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Mixture will be very thick, and it is helpful to use a stand mixer.
Transfer to a large bowl and gradually beat in sugar; stir in nuts. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls onto lined pan.  Let stand about 4 hours or until firm.  Turn candies over and dry at least 12 hours.  Store in an airtight container.
