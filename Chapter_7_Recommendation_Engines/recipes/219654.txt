Ingredients:
2 pounds Swiss chard, stemmed and chopped
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 ounces raisins
2 ounces pine nuts
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and pour in enough water to reach just below the bottom of the insert. Bring the water to a boil. Add the chard and steam until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the raisins and pine nuts in the hot oil until the pine nuts turn golden, about 5 minutes. Add the chard, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking while stirring constantly until the chard is hot, about 2 minutes.
