Description: 
This is a fun way to announce the gender of your unborn baby to family, friends, and coworkers! I created this recipe because I not only wanted to make sure they looked cute, but they had to taste great too! I've been told by several people that they have never eaten a cupcake that tasted this good! Happy Baking! 

Add colorful pink and blue sprinkles, creative toppers etc. to these cupcakes to make them extra cute! These cupcakes should be refrigerated and can last a few days...if any are left.
