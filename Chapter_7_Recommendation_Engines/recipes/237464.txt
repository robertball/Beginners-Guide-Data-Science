Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup diced celery
1/4 cup minced onion
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 cup rice flour
1 cup seafood stock, or more as needed
1 pint half-and-half
1 pint heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup milk (optional)
2 cups cooked crabmeat

Directions:
Spray a stockpot with cooking spray.
Melt butter in the prepared stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir celery, onion, paprika, seafood seasoning, thyme, salt, and white pepper until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour into vegetable mixture until smooth and dissolved. Pour seafood stock over vegetable mixture.
Mix half-and-half, cream, and milk into broth mixture; decrease heat and simmer until bisque is thickened, about 15 minutes. Add crabmeat and simmer bisque until crabmeat is heated through, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This is not a thick soup, yet it is creamy and so smooth to the palette. The aroma when cooking makes you want some before the potatoes are soft. I have made modifications due to allergy to corn (such as rice flour). I allow mine to slow-simmer with lid slightly ajar. Stir often so the film does not form on top. I have doubled my batch and still never have any for the freezer.
