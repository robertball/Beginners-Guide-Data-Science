Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
6 slices maple-cured bacon, or more to taste
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, or as needed
1/3 cup maple syrup, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons red colored sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.
Stir cake mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a large bowl until moistened; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour cake mixture into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes; cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, crumble bacon into a small bowl.
Beat butter until creamy with an electric mixer in a bowl; slowly beat in 2 cups confectioners' sugar until well blended. Beat maple syrup and vanilla extract into butter mixture until smooth and creamy; beat in remaining confectioners' sugar as needed until frosting mixture is a spreadable consistency. Fold crumbled bacon into frosting.
Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread about 1/2 cup bacon frosting evenly over cake. Place second cake layer over the first; spread remaining frosting evenly over sides and top of cake.
Draw or print a maple leaf shape on a piece of paper. Fold the page in half down the center of the leaf; cut along the outline so that you will have a hole in the paper in the shape of a maple leaf. Center the paper on top of the frosted cake; press down slightly on the cut edges. Sprinkle the open area with red sugar; gently remove the paper stencil.
