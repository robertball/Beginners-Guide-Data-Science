Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
Filling:
1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup chopped strawberries
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and melted butter in a mixing bowl; mix until evenly moistened and press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is lightly browned and smells toasted, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.
Soak gelatin in cold water for 3 minutes. Heat the water and gelatin in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, stirring frequently, until gelatin is completely dissolved.
Beat whipping cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form.
Stir strawberries and 1/3 cup sugar together in a bowl. Pour gelatin mixture over strawberries. Gently fold in whipped cream until incorporated. Pour filling into baked pie shell and chill in the refrigerator until set, at least 2 hours.
