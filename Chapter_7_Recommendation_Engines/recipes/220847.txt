Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1 cup cubed fully cooked ham
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 small onion, minced
1/3 pound processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed
1/2 cup crushed potato chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Mix egg noodles, ham, evaporated milk, cream of chicken soup, onion, and processed cheese food in a 9x13-inch baking dish until evenly distributed.
Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and cheese food is melted, about 1 hour. About 5 minutes before end of baking, sprinkle chips atop casserole and return to oven; bake for 5 minutes more.
