12 slices bacon
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/3 cup minced onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet, and fry over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels, then chop coarsely. Sprinkle bacon, cheese and onion into pastry shell.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, salt, sugar and cayenne pepper. Pour mixture into pastry shell.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), and bake an additional 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted 1 inch from edge comes out clean. Allow quiche to sit 10 minutes before cutting into wedges.

Description: 
For this classic recipe, crumbled bacon, Swiss cheese and a bit of diced onion are scattered in the bottom of a pastry shell and practically drowned in a luscious mixture of cream, eggs, sugar and cayenne pepper. The baked quiche is cooled slightly before being cut into beautiful wedges and served.Modified from: Quiche Lorraine I
