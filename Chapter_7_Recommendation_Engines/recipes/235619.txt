Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package fresh or frozen cranberries
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, or more to taste
1 tangerine, juiced
1 tangerine, zested and juiced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Stir cranberries, confectioners' sugar, tangerine juice, tangerine zest, and cinnamon together in a non-stick saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the cranberries pop and the mixture thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. Crush any remaining whole cranberries against the sides of the saucepan with a spatula to burst.

Description: 
This is my version of a cranberry relish that my mom made when I was a kid. If you can, make it 1 or 2 days in advance, as the flavors need to mellow a little bit in the fridge.
