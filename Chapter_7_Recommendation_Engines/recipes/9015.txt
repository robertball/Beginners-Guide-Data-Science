6 slices Swiss cheese
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing

Dip rolled/stuffed chicken breasts into buttermilk, then crumbs. Place coated chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish and put butter or margarine pieces around chicken. Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove cover for last 15 minutes to brown.
