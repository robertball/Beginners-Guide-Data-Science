Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees F/43 to 46 degrees C), divided
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F/43 to 46 degrees C)
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup warm water in a bowl; let stand until mixture is foaming, about 10 minutes.
Stir warm milk, 6 tablespoons sugar, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup warm water into yeast mixture. Gradually whisk 2 cups flour into yeast mixture until smooth. Add remaining 3 1/2 cup flour, egg, 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons vegetable oil to flour-yeast mixture; stir until dough is soft.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once so top of dough is greased. Cover bowl with a damp towel and let rise in a warm room until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch dough and divide in half. Roll each half on a floured surface until 1/3 to 1/2-inch thick. Cut dough using a floured 2 1/2-inch round cutter. Brush each dough circle with melted butter.
Make an off-center crease in each dough circle using the dull edge of a table knife. Fold along crease so larger half is on top; press along folded edge.
Grease a baking sheet.
Arrange folded dough circles, 2 to 3 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove towel or plastic wrap from dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer rolls to a wire rack to cool.
