Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1/4 cup light brown sugar
4 teaspoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons black pepper
Sauce:
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup light molasses
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons whole grain Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons black pepper
2 teaspoons orange zest
2 racks Smithfield® Extra Tender Pork Spareribs, membrane removed
Handful hickory or apple wood chips for smoking, soaked in water and drained (optional)
3/4 cup apple juice, in a spray bottle

Directions:
About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all ingredients in small bowl; mix well.   Pat ribs dry with paper towels; generously coat both sides of ribs with rub.  Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, make the sauce.  Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes until slightly thickened, stirring frequently.  Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate.
Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.
Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.
Continue cooking ribs for 1 to 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender, spraying with apple juice every 20 to 30 minutes.  Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.
Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.
Serve ribs with remaining sauce.
