Description: 
This shrimp dish is fast and easy to prepare and tastes delicious! Serve it alongside some stir-fried veggies and cooked jasmine rice and you are going to be loving life! The amount of butter seems like a lot, but most of it melts into the bottom of the pan and is not consumed. This dish is very similar to shrimp scampi, except with an Asian twist to it! Enjoy!
