Ingredients:
3 cups beef stock
1/4 cup toenjang (fermented soybean paste)
1 (4 inch) piece dashi kombu (dried kelp) (optional)
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package medium-firm tofu, cut into 1 1/2 x 1/4 inch dominoes
1 pound napa cabbage, thickly sliced
1 pound daikon radish cut into 1 1/2x1/4 inch pieces
1 pound yellow squash, cut into 1 1/2x1/4 inch dominoes
2 large green onions, white and pale green part only, sliced diagonally into 1 1/4 inch pieces
1 hot red pepper, seeded and sliced diagonally into 1/4 inch pieces

Directions:
Pour the beef stock into a stock pot or large deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in the toenjang until dissolved. Add the kelp and garlic, and bring to a boil. Put in the tofu, cabbage, daikon and yellow squash, cover and return to a boil. Cook gently for 5 minutes. Then add the green onions and hot pepper, and boil for a minute, or until the onion and pepper become fragrant and brightly colored. Limit the cooking time to no more than 15 minutes.  Remove and discard kelp. Serve immediately.
