Ingredients:
Hibiscus Salt:
1 teaspoon dried hibiscus flowers
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced lengthwise
1 pound shelled fava beans, unpeeled
1 tablespoon chicken stock
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint

Directions:
Pulse hibiscus flowers in a spice grinder until finely ground. Pour into a small jar; add salt. Shake until blended.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Cook garlic slices until sizzling, about 30 seconds. Add fava beans and chicken stock; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until fava bean skins begin to wrinkle, about 6 minutes. Uncover and cook for 1 minute more.
Transfer fava beans to a serving dish. Discard garlic. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon oil over fava beans. Garnish with hibiscus salt and mint.

Description: 
When fava beans are in season and abundant, here's a quick way to prepare and serve them without having to remove the peel. Mint is a natural complement for favas, and subtle floral hibiscus salt is a perfect seasoning. Use leftover cooked favas in composed salads, like salade Nicoise.
