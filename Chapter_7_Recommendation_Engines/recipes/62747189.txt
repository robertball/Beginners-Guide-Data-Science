1 1/2 t. baking powder
1 t. baking soda
1 t. salt
2/3 c. butter, softened

Directions:
Heat oven to 350.  Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.
Heat chocolate with water in saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, just until melted.  Stir in sour cream.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl.  Beat butter in mixing bowl until creamy.  Gradually beat in sugars until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add vanilla.  At low speed, add dry ingredients alternately with chocolate mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.  Beat until blended.
Pour batter into prepared pans.  Bake 30-35 min, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool in pans on wire racks 10 min.  Unmold; cool completely.
