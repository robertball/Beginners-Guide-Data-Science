Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups turbinado sugar (organic or natural brown sugar)
3/4 cup water
2T rosewater
1/2 pound butter (two sticks)(or 1/2 pound of non-hydrogenated tub margarine or 2 sticks, equal to 1 cup, soy margarine)
1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts or Pistachios
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
1. Make sugar syrup
* Boil turbinado sugar  and  water for about 2m over high heat; just before turning off heat
*add rosewater
* Cool slightly then refrigerate
2. Clarify margarine or butter to make "ghee"
*Melt butter/margarine over gentle heat
* Once froth starts forming, keep spooning it off and discarding.
* Leave solid residues behind, about 1 c left
3. In a food processor, quickly pulse nuts to a medium mince, add 2T/1 ounce each of syrup and filling and touch of cinnamon, and mix well
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
5. With ghee, grease 10"x14" baking pan
6. Prepare to work with filo. You will want to fold each sheet completely into the baking tray instead of leaving it overhanging.
*open 1 pound box of filo pastry, spread on clean surface, and have on hand a barely damp cloth to immediately cover the filo, if the filo gets too much air it will get crisp and be unusable.
*Place a sheet of filo in the bottom of the pan (1/2 will fit), ghee the surface, and fold over
*Continue till you have a third of the sheets in
7. Distribute half of the nut mixture in an even layer, optionally with 2 ounces (an eighth of a pound) or so of unsweetened chocolate pieces
8. Continue with another third of the pastry and top with the rest of the nut mixture (no chocolate)
9. Continue with the rest of the pastry sheets
10. After putting remaining ghee the top, cut through the whole stack with a sharp knife in (14" across) horizontal bands 1" apart, then on diagonals to make diamonds
11. Bake for 30m then increase heat to 425 degF and bake another 10m till puffed and golden brown
12. Remove from oven and immediately pour cold sugar water syrup over hot pastry
13. Serve when comes down to room temperature

Description: 
This is basically an easy recipe.  It came from a Greek woman that I knew in Tarpon Springs, Florida.  The hard parts are making the syrup and the ghee but the directions are pretty simple.
