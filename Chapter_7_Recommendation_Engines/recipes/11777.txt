Ingredients:
16 ounces rotini pasta
4 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 ¼ teaspoons salt
1 ¼ teaspoons garlic powder
1 ¼ teaspoons dried basil
1 ¼ teaspoons dried oregano
1 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute chicken, garlic, salt, garlic powder, basil, and oregano in hot oil until chicken is no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pour pasta into pot and toss with chicken until combined. Top with Parmesan cheese.
