Ingredients:
•3 cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and grated.
•2 tsp. salt
•1 pint plain yogurt
•2 cloves garlic
•3 Tbsp. mint, fresh
•2 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
•Juice of 1 lemon
•Mortar and pestle

Directions:
Crush garlic with flat side of a knife and remove skin.
Add garlic and 1 tsp. salt to mortar and pestle. Grind into a paste.
Once the garlic becomes a paste, add 1 Tbsp. of the mint, and continue to grind. Once the mint is well crushed, add another table spoon, grind, and repeat once more. At this point all the mint should have been added to the garlic and crushed.
In a large bowl, mix yogurt, garlic and mint paste, and lemon juice and stir well.
Add cucumbers and fold in.
Add olive oil and the remaining 1 tsp. of salt. Stir well to combine.
Refrigerate for 1 hour before serving. Garnish with fresh mint.
