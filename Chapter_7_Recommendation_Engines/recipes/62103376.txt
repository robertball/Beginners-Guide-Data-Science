Ingredients:
2 slices whole wheat "Weight Watchers" bread
1/4 cup egg substitute
3/4 cup skim milk
2 tbsp. ground cinnamon
2 tbsp. fat free cream cheese
1/2 of a banana, cut into thin slices
1 tbsp. raspberry preserves
2 tsp. powdered sugar
1 tbsp. coconut

Directions:
Combine egg substitute, milk, and cinnamon into a bowl, set aside.
In another bowl, combine cream cheese, raspberry preserves, powdered sugar, and coconut.  Stir until well combined.
Spread cream cheese mixture onto one side of each piece of bread.  Put banana slices on one piece of bread (also nuts if desired) and then put the other piece of top.  This creates a sandwich.
Dip sandwich into milk and egg mixture until well coated.  Place on a hot, greased pan and cook until both sides are browned.  Top with more cinnamon, powdered sugar, and syrup if desired.
