Ingredients:
1 pound (or less) ground turkey sausage
1 1/4 teaspoons crushed or ground red pepper flakes
1 large onion, diced
1 tablespoon (or more) minced garlic
5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth
6 potatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup milk
Lots of fresh spinach or kale ripped
Cooking spray

Directions:
Cook the turkey sausage and red pepper in a soup pot over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Spray the pot with cooking spray. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour the chicken broth into the pot with the garlic and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the milk and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.
