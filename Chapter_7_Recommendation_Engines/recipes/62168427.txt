Ingredients:
2 cups pickled jalapenos
1 cup dill pickle chips (I like Ovals)
1/2 oz Tequila
1 clove of Garlic
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 tsp fresh cracked pepper
1 tsp Dill (dried is fine)
Splash of Tabasco

Directions:
In a food processor add all ingredients and blend (drain pickles and jalapenos).  Consistancy is up to the cook.
If you prefer more texture, pull out your chef's knife and finely chop: jalapenos, onion, dill pickles.  Add to bowl.  Mince the garlic.  Add to bowl.  Mix all ingredients with tequila, dill spice, pepper and Tabasco.
Serve chilled.  Add to sour cream or cream cheese for a dip or spread.
