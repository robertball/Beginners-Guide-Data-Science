https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ketchup
1/2 tablespoon oyster sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 ounces ground beef
5 ounces ground pork
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 egg
1/4 onion, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 carrot, peeled
5 thin-sliced bacon
10 garlic scapes, sliced

Directions:
Combine ketchup, oyster sauce, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and mix well.
Combine beef, pork, panko, egg, onion, and minced garlic in a large bowl. Add the ketchup mixture and mix well.
Cut carrot into quarters along its length, then into pieces the same length as the garlic scapes.
Cover the bottom of a microwave-safe rectangular dish with bacon slices, overlapping as needed. Spread 1/2 of the meat mixture over the bacon. Arrange carrot and garlic scapes on top; spread remaining meat mixture over vegetables.
Cover and microwave meat loaf at 600W for 8 minutes. Let rest, covered, until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. Slice to serve.

Description: 
This is a delicious recipe for meat loaf. Cooking it in a microwave cuts the cooking time in almost half as compared to baking it in an oven. It's delicious and juicy. The bacon at the bottom does a great job in absorbing the juices from the meat.
