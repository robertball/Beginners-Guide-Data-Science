Ingredients:
1/4 cup light brown sugar
3 Tbsp. cornstarch
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 3/4 tsp. cinnamon
2 tsp. ginger
1/4 tsp. cloves
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup canned pumpkin
Â¼ cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Heat and oil waffle iron.
Combine brown sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl. Whisk together to break apart the cornstarch. Add the remaining dry ingredients, and whisk to blend.
Lightly beat eggs; add milk, pumpkin and butter and whisk to blend.  Stir in dry ingredients and combine until moist, but still slightly lumpy.  Adjust consistency of batter as needed by adding a little more milk or a little more flour.
For extra fluffy waffles, separate eggs and continue as above with egg yolks.  Whip egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold whipped egg whites into waffle batter just until combined.
Cook in heated waffle iron and enjoy!
For pancakes, add milk to thin the batter, if needed, and cook on a hot griddle (350-375 degrees).
Serve with cranberry preserves, maple syrup, or a little butter and powdered sugar.

Yummy waffles with just a little butter and powdered sugar or even nothing at all!  I included the dry ingredients for these waffles as a mix in a breakfast basket once and everyone requested the recipe.
