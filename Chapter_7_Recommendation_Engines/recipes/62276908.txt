Ingredients:
2 kiwis, peeled and diced
2 tart apples - peeled, cored and diced
8 ounces raspberries
1 pound strawberries, cored and diced
8 ounces blueberries
3 tablespoons fruit preserves (or jam), any flavor (I like raspberry)

Directions:
If you have one, using a food chopper for the apples and strawberries shortens preparation time immensely;
In a large bowl thoroughly mix kiwis, apples, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries (and any additional fruit you'd like.  I've added peaches (sometimes fresh, sometimes canned), pears, blackberries, mangos etc.) and fruit preserves. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes.
