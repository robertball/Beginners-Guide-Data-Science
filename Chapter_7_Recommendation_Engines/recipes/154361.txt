1 (7 ounce) can chopped jalapenos, drained
1/2 head lettuce, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/3 cup dried cilantro
3 tablespoons ground cumin
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 onion, chopped
1/4 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Combine the tomatillos, jalapenos, lettuce, garlic, cilantro, cumin, salt, and pepper in a blender or food processor; process until chopped to desired consistency.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook the onions in the melted butter until clarified, about 5 minutes. Pour the tomatillo mixture and the chicken broth into the sauce pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until the salsa begins to thicken, about 20 minutes.
