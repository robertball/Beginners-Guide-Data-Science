Ingredients:
4 TysonÂ® Fresh Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts
2 teaspoons margarine or butter
1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated crusty French loaf dough
2 shallots, chopped
1 1/2 cups reduced-fat Colby-Jack cheese
3 eggs
2 egg whites
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated skim milk
1/4 teaspoon tarragon leaves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
Paprika

Directions:
PREP: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. CLEAN: Wash hands. Lightly spray bottom of 13 x 9-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Unroll loaf; gently press into sprayed baking pan, covering bottom and 1 1/2 inches up sides. Bake at 400 degrees F 10 minutes. Remove from oven. In medium nonstick skillet, melt margarine over medium-high heat. Add chicken. Cover and cook 3 minutes. Turn chicken over and top with shallots. Reduce heat to medium; cover. Cook 4 to 5 minutes longer or until internal juices of chicken run clear. (Or insert instant-read meat thermometer in thickest part of chicken. Temperature should read 170 degrees F for breasts and 180 degrees F for thighs.) Remove from heat. Transfer chicken and shallots to cutting board; shred or chop chicken. Spread 1 1/4 cups cheese in bottom of crust; top with chicken and shallot mixture. In large bowl, blend eggs, egg whites, evaporated skim milk, tarragon, salt and pepper. Pour evenly over chicken and cheese mixture, taking care not to spill over edge of crust. Top with remaining 1/4 cup cheese; sprinkle with paprika.
COOK: Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake casserole at 350 degrees F 40 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes.
SERVE: Cut into 12 serving pieces. Serve warm.
CHILL: Refrigerate leftovers immediately.
