Ingredients:
1 cup bran flakes cereal
3/8 cup whole wheat flour
3/8 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup applesauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Combine bran flakes cereal, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Whisk applesauce, sugar, vegetable oil, and egg together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until just combined. Fill muffin cups about 2/3-full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes on a wire rack; serve warm.
