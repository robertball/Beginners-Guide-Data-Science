Description: 
Yes, finally a toum that is foolproof! This is an emulsified garlic spread. It is delicious and flavorful. Serve this with kafta, kabobs, pita, etc. We love this! Use the drizzle function in your food processor to slowly add the oil. The pusher in the top has a little hole to drizzle in oil for emulsions.
