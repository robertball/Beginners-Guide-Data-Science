Ingredients:
1/4 rennet tablet
1/4 cup unchlorinated water
1/2 gallon pasteurized whole milk
2 tablespoons kosher salt

Directions:
Dissolve rennet in the water.
Pour milk into a heavy pot. Heat slowly to 90 degrees F (32 degrees C), stirring occasionally. Turn off heat and gently stir in the rennet solution.
Cover pot and let rest in a warm place, at about 90 degrees F (32 degrees C), until the curd forms a thick mass, about 40 minutes. Place your finger or spatula in the curd and gently lift to check for a clean break; it should split along a clean line and not be too soft or milky. Let rest for another 10 minutes if it isn't quite firm.
Cut curds into 1/4-inch cubes using your finger, a knife, or a spatula. Heat curds and the remaining liquid, or whey, to 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 46 degrees C), about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Ladle curds into a colander; discard whey or keep for another use. Gently mix salt into the curds using your fingers.
Line a colander or plastic container with a cheesecloth; add curds and wrap cheesecloth around the top. Place a heavy weight on top, such as a small bowl filled with pie weights or a jar of water. Press for 4 to 6 hours.
