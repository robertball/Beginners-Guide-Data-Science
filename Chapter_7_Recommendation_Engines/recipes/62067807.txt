Ingredients:
1 1/4 lb filet of sole, tilapia or flounder
1 sleeve Ritz Crackers, crushed
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 lb cooked shrimp, chopped
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 cup milk
6 oz Velveeta Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.  Combine crackers, melted butter and shrimp to form a stuffing.  Place a small amount in each filet.  You will not use all of the stuffing.  Roll up filet and secure with toothpicks.  Place in a lightly oiled casserole dish.
Over medium heat, combine soup, milk and cheese in a saucepan, stirring often until melted.  Pour cheese mixture over fish.  Top fish with the remaining stuffing mixture.  Bake 25-30 minutes, or until fish is done.
