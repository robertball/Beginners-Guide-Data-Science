Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup finely chopped onions
1 cup thinly sliced fresh mushrooms
½ cup white wine
1 (24 fluid ounce) bottle Ranch dressing
3 teaspoons garlic powder
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3  eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup crushed crackers
8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onions and mushrooms until tender. Mix in the wine, and continue cooking about 5 minutes, until heated through.
In a large bowl, mix the Ranch dressing, garlic powder, oregano, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper. Stir the skillet mixture into the bowl. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons butter, eggs, and crackers.
Dip the chicken breasts in the Ranch dressing mixture to coat. Arrange chicken in a medium baking dish. Cover with the remaining dressing mixture.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
