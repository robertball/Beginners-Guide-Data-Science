Ingredients:
3 oz box raspberry Jell-o mix
2 C hot water
2 C white grape juice
3 C ginger ale
1/4 C lime juice

Directions:
In a 2 quart glass pitcher, mix together the hot water and Jell-o until the Jell-o dissolves.  Let cool to room temperature (don't put in the refrigerator or it will set up!) and stir in remaining ingredients.

Description: 
My yummy variation on the Melted Witch/Green Punch which is very limey.  Have the juice and ginger ale refrigerated so the punch can be served immediately while the ginger ale is still fizzy.
