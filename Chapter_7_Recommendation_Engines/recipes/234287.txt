Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 egg
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 (8 ounce) package unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (16 ounce) package prepared chocolate frosting, or as needed

Directions:
Grease a 9x9-inch pan.
Melt brown sugar, butter, chocolate, and egg in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Stir graham cracker crumbs and walnuts into chocolate mixture; press evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Stir together shredded coconut and condensed milk in a bowl; spread evenly over chocolate layer. Spread frosting over coconut mixture. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
This is a cookie my mom used to make every year at Christmas. The base is like a Nanaimo bar but the coconut filling makes it not as sweet.
