Description: 
I had oranges and apples in the house and couldn't find a recipe that used them both so I created this one. This is a great side-dish for a holiday gathering or would even be good as a dessert over French vanilla ice cream -- or even better if you cook this the night before and heat it up before serving. Enjoy!
