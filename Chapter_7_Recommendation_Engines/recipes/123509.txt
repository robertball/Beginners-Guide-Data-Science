Ingredients:
1/2 pound boneless round steak
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1/4 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cut meat into two portions; pound to 1/4-in. thickness. Combine 1 tablespoon flour and salt; coat meat on both sides. In a skillet, brown meat in oil. Transfer meat to a greased shallow 2-qt. baking dish; set aside.
To pan drippings, add tomatoes, carrot, celery, onion, Worcestershire sauce and remaining flour. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Pour over meat. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Sprinkle with cheese; return to the oven until cheese is melted.

Description: 
THIS DISH is one of my husband's favorites, so I make it often. It's also a handy recipe - while it's in the oven, you can do other things.    The meat becomes very tender, and the vegetables add delicious flavor. -Dolores Wynne, Clearwater, Florida
