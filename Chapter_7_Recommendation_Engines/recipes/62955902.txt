Ingredients:
1 large can of fat-free refried beans
1 small can of diced green chilis
1/2 cup chunky salsa
handfull of grated cheddar cheese
dash or two of Frank's Red Hot sauce (optional)
2 large baby diapers (unused, of course)
Corn chips

Directions:
Place the beans, chilis, salsa, cheese, and hot sauce in a large pot.  Cook on medium low heat, stirring often, until the beans are creamy and the cheese is melted.
Open up the diapers.  To help them stay put, tape the back of the diaper to the wall and the front of the diaper to the countertop with clear scotch tape or packing tape.  Fill them with the bean dip, but be careful NOT to fill it past the elastic leak guard piece in the diaper where the child's legs would go.
Spread a bag of corn chips around the countertop and watch your friends enjoy the yummy poo!
