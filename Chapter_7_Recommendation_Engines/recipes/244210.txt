Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup butter
1 (6 ounce) package herb-seasoning stuffing mix (such as Kraft® Stove Top®)
1 large eggplant, halved lengthwise
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 egg, beaten
paprika to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.
Bring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; add stuffing mix and cover saucepan. Remove saucepan from heat and let stand for 5 minutes; fluff stuffing with a fork.
Scoop the flesh from eggplant and dice, reserving shells. Mix eggplant pulp, stuffing, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and egg together in a bowl. Fill each eggplant shell with stuffing mixture and top with paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is cooked through and crisp on the top, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
This is a really good way to fix eggplant if you don't feel like the typical fried eggplant. I actually came up with this recipe, though because I did not have all the ingredients to make the fried eggplant! It was a big hit! Enjoy!
