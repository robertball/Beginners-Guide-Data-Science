Ingredients:
1 1/2 sticks of very cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons of sugar
1/3 cup very crisco butter flavored vegetable shortening, cut into pieces
1/2 cup of ice water

Directions:
Dice the butter and the shortening and place them in a bowl in the freezer while you gather and prepare the remainder of the ingredients.
Measure and mix the flour, salt, and sugar in a bowl.
Place ingredients in a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix.
Add the diced butter and crisco and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
With the food processor running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball.
Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball.Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes split the dough in half.Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle. Roll from the center out to the edge, turning and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board.
When rolled out fold the dough in half and place in a 9 in deep dish pie plate. Uunfold to fit the plate.
Fill with desired pie filling. Repeat with the top crust and trim and crimp the edges.
