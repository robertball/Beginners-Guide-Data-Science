Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pound of quartered fresh strawberries
1 pound of rhubarb sliced 1/4 inch
3 tbsp corn starch
2 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp vanilla
Topping
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 sticks of butter (softened)
1 1/4 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix 3/4 cup of white sugar with the rhubarb and let set for 15 minutes stirring occasionally, in another bowl mix the remaining sugar with the strawberries and let sit for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Combine the rhubarb into the strawberries leaving behind any juice in the bottom of the bowl Mix the cornstarch, lemon juice and vanilla into the fruit. Place the mixture in a 9x9 inch baking pan.
For topping.
Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, brown sugar, butter, and oats until crumbly. You may want to use a pastry blender for this. Crumble on top of the rhubarb and strawberry mixture.
Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven at 375 then turn down to 325 and bake another 30 minutes, or until crisp and lightly browned. You may want to place a tray under the baking pan to catch any overflow from bubbling.
