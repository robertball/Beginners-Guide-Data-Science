Ingredients:
1 whole chicken
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups uncooked rice
2 chicken bouillon cubes
1/2 small onion, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Boil your chicken in a big pot of water til thoroughly cooked. Take out and let cool.
Peel chicken off bone. Cut into small chunks (whatever size you desire). Discard bones, gristle and skin.
Take the water you boiled it in and measure out 3 cups of water. Throw away the rest & put the 3 cups back in the pot.
Add salt, pepper, onion and bouillon cubes to the water.
Pour rice into water, bring to boil (just for a minute or so), cover and simmer til rice is done.
Mix the chicken into the rice. Add salt and pepper depending on how much you like (I season mine well).
Heat up when ready to serve or serve after mixing!
