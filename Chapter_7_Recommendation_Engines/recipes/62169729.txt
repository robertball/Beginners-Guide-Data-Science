Ingredients:
2 cups sooji rava (semolina)
4 cups water
2 tablespoons ghee
¼ cup oil
1 teaspoon mustard (rai) seeds
1 tablespoon urad dal (skinned split black lentils)
1 teaspoon chana dal (split Bengal gram)
2 dry red chillis, broken
1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing)
2 tablespoons cashewnuts (optional)
1 tomato, chopped fine
2 onions, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
3 green chillies, chopped into thin rounds
1 sprig curry leaves (kadipatta/karavepa aaku)
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
Juice of 1 – 2 limes
Salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add urad dal, chana dal, mustard seeds, red chillis, and cashewnuts, if using. Fry till dals and nuts are golden brown. Add asafoetida. Add the curry leaves, onions, and green chillis. Stir fry till onions are softened, but not brown, about 5 minutes.
Pour in 4 cups of water, ginger, tomatoes, and salt. Bring the water to a boil. Gradually pour in the rava, in a thin stream, stirring continuously while pouring. This is very important. If you add the rava in too fast, or do not stir quick enough, you will get lumps.
The mixture will start bubbling. Lower heat to simmer, cover, and let the upma cook for 10 – 15 minutes. Take the cover off, and add in lime juice (to taste) and ghee. Stir well. Let the upma rest for 10 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
In Andhra they call this upma “Bombay rava” upma. It is extremely soft and spongy in texture. When I was a kid, I loved eating this upma as balls rolled in sugar. This upma makes an excellent accompaniment to Pesarattu.
