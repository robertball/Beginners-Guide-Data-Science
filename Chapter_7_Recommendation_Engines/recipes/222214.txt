Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups elbow macaroni
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
3 tablespoons finely chopped green bell pepper
3 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
2 tablespoons finely chopped yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup finely chopped carrots

Directions:
Mix salt, dry mustard, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, white pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse macaroni under cold water until cooled.
Whisk mayonnaise, sour cream, and evaporated milk in a large salad bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy; stir in seasoning mix until well blended. Mix macaroni, onion, green, red, and yellow bell pepper, celery, and carrots into the dressing until thoroughly coated.

Description: 
I have looked all over for a great macaroni salad; this one is it! It's easy and is a huge hit at every function I take it to. The sauce for this is a great creamy sauce. I like my salads to have a lot of creamy dressing, so I always make an extra half batch of the wet mix and add it as necessary to get the salad more wet because the pasta soaks up the sauce.
