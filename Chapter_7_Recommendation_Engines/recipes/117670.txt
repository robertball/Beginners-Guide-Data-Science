Ingredients:
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 teaspoon pepper
1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast

1 cup chopped onion
3 garlic cloves, minced

1/2 cup frozen unsweetened apple juice concentrate, thawed
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine the thyme, sage and pepper; rub over pork. In a Dutch oven, brown meat on all sides in oil; remove and keep warm. In the same pan, saute onion and garlic until tender. Add the apple, apple juice concentrate and salt; bring to a boil. Return meat to the pan. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 55-75 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting occasionally with juices.Remove to a serving platter and keep warm.
Pour cooking liquid into a measuring cup; skim off fat. Cool cooking liquid slightly; place in a blender or food processor. Cover and process until smooth. Serve with the roast.

Description: 
Apples add fruity flavor to the gravy that's served with this tender herb-rubbed pork roast. 'Try serving it with baked apple slices, boiled potatoes or French bread', suggests Diane Hixon from Niceville, Florida.
