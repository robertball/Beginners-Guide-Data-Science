Ingredients:
1 pound venison steaks, cubed
1/3 cup teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons Creole seasoning
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Place the venison in a large bowl. Cover with the teriyaki sauce, and sprinkle with garlic. Marinate at least 4 hours in the refrigerator.
Sift together the flour and Creole seasoning. Dredge the venison in the flour mixture to coat. Discard remaining marinade.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the venison 15 minutes, or until browned.

Description: 
My family gobbles this up every time I cook it, which is pretty often since we eat mainly venison over beef. Has no gamey taste and can also be used with cubed beef. Let it marinate for 4-12 hours, preferably overnight.
