Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 carrot, diced
3 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
5 leaves fresh basil, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (15 ounce) cans chicken broth, or more to taste
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 pounds swordfish, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 (6.5 ounce) cans whole baby clams, undrained
1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, green bell pepper, celery, and carrot; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Season with oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
Pour chicken broth into the pot; simmer until celery and carrot are soft, about 20 minutes. Pour in crushed tomatoes and white wine; simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Stir swordfish into the pot; cook until easily flaked with a fork, about 10 minutes. Pour in clams with juices; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cornstarch until stew thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a hearty, satisfying stew that I have tweaked around. I serve this with a really good crusty bread.
