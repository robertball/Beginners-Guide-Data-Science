Ingredients:
2 (14.4 ounce) packages graham crackers (such as Honey Maid®), crushed
3/4 cup butter, melted
6 (1.5 ounce) bars milk chocolate candy bar (such as Hershey's®), broken into squares
126 miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 42 miniature muffin tins with paper liners.
Mix graham cracker crumbs with butter in a bowl until evenly combined. Spoon graham cracker mixture into the prepared muffin cups, pressing into the bottom and up the sides creating a crust.
Place 1 chocolate square onto each crust and top each with 3 miniature marshmallows.
Bake in the preheated oven until marshmallows are puffy and chocolate is melted, about 6 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted s'mores one evening and I didn't want to build a fire. This is one of my now favorite recipes. It takes a little more time but it's not messy and great for little kids. Don't have to worry about cleaning their hands, might have to clean around their mouth though, if you have one of those children that could make a mess out of absolutely nothing. I was one of those children and still am today.
