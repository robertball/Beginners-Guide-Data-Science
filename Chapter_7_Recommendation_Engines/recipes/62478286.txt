3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 1/4 tsp vanilla
3 1/2 cups flour

ICING:
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 TBSP melted butter

Directions:
Beat together the margarine, white sugar, and eggs, then beat in milk and vanilla.
Mix in by hand flour, baking powder and salt.
Spread 3/4 of the batter into a greased 10x15 pan.
Evenly spread fruit filling to within one inch of the edge.
Spoon on (in small clumps) the remaining batter. (Smooth out the clumps a little).
Bake at 325 degrees for 34 minutes.
Beat together powdered sugar, milk, vanilla and melted butter. Frosting should be a thinner consistency.
Once bars have cooled, drizzle with icing.
