Description: 
I make this for my family all the time! This is a great recipe for vegan/vegetarian diets, just replace the peanut butter with organic peanut butter or another nut butter. Substitute water for milk if desired. The more milk you add, the thinner and soupier your ice cream will be. Serve with sliced fresh fruit or handmade whipped cream.
