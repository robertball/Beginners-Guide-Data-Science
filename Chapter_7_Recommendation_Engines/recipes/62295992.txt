Ingredients:
lb dry navy beans
8 cups water
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup light molasses
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tsp dry mustard
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
10 dashes Frank's hot sauce
1 clove garlic chopped
1 tbsp honey
3 tbsp chopped jalapeno peppers
3 tbsp tomato paste
1 large onion chopped
4 ounces salt pork cut up (I make them large enough to see easily so I can remove them before serving)

Directions:
Rinse beans.   In large sauce pan filled with 8 cups water, place beans with the 1/2 tsp salt.
Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours.
Pour beans and water in a bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight.
Place beans and water in crock pot with remaining ingredients.
Mix well and cook on low 12 to 14 hours. **see footnotes on cooking times.
Stir well before serving.
