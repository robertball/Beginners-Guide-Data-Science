Ingredients:
2 large eggs
1/2 cup whole milk, heavy cream, or half-and-half
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
pinch of salt
4 (1/2-inch thick) slices day-old bread (try brioche, cinnamon-swirl, French bread, or Hawaiian sweet bread)

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron to medium. If you usually pre-coat yours with cooking spray, go ahead.
Whisk eggs, milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt together in a wide bowl until thoroughly combined. Dip bread slices one at a time in mixture to coat both sides completely. Lift bread with a slotted spatula and let excess mixture drain back into the bowl. Place slices on a rimmed baking sheet and let them rest for 2 minutes to let the mixture soak in.
Place bread in the preheated waffle iron. Close the lid, but donâ€™t force it down. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown. If your waffle iron takes only one slice at a time, repeat with the rest of the bread.

Description: 
Making French toast in your waffle iron combines the best of both worlds. You get all the custardy richness of French toast plus waffle's signature crispy ridges. All the better to hold more maple syrup.
