Ingredients:
Roasted Garlic French Bread:
1 (4 ounce) package IdahoanÂ® Roasted Garlic Flavored Mashed Potatoes
1 pound butter, softened
1 loaf French bread
Greek Salad:
1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, cut in half
1 cup cucumber, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thickness and cut into quarters
1 medium red onion, chopped into thin slices and soaked 10 minutes in small bowl of ice water to reduce sharpness
1 small green pepper, coarse chopped
3/4 cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 garlic cloves, minced
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese, for topping
Tzatziki Sauce:
2 cups plain Greek yogurt
1 cup cucumber, small dice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Mix the dry package of Idahoan Roasted Garlic Potatoes with the butter until blended. Slice the French bread length wise and generously spread with the roasted garlic mixture. Toast under the broiler until butter spread is melted and toasted on top. (You can also grill the Garlic Bread--see footnote.)
Greek Salad: Drain onion from ice water and pat dry with paper towels. In a large bowl combine all salad ingredients, except cheese. Top the French bread with the Greek salad and sprinkle cheese over top. Serve with Tzatziki sauce.
Tzatziki Sauce: In a medium bowl, combine Greek yogurt, cucumber, lemon juice, garlic, and dill. Stir until well combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
