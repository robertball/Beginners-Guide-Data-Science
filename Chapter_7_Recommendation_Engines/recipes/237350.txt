Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dried black-eyed peas (cowpeas)
1 onion, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 1/2 cups water, or more if needed

Directions:
Place black-eyed peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse peas.
Combine peas, onion, tomato sauce, olive oil, cilantro, garlic, salt, cumin, paprika, ginger, and cayenne pepper in a stockpot; pour 3 1/2 cups water over pea mixture. Bring water to a boil, decrease heat to low, cover pot, and simmer, stirring occasionally and adding more water if sauce gets too thick, until peas are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
