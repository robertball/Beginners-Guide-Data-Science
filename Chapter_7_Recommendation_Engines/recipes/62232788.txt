Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°.
Cube and cook chicken breasts over medium heat, seasoning to taste with pepper and seasoned salt.

Warm the tortillas, then fill each with a couple spoonfuls of the filling and a pinch of grated cheese. Roll and place in 9 x 13 pan, side by side. Pour the topping over the rolled enchiladas, then sprinkle with cheese.
