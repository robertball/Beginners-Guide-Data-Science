Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup chopped asparagus
1 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic (such as Hunt'sÂ®), drained
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
12 pitted kalamata olives, halved
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Lay spaghetti squash halves with cut sides down onto a baking sheet.
Bake squash in the preheated oven until a knife easily cuts the skin, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and use a fork to pull and separate the strands of squash from the skin; set spaghetti squash aside in a large bowl and keep warm.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus, onion, and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in fire-roasted tomatoes, feta cheese, and olives; cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Toss tomato mixture with spaghetti squash until thoroughly combined; season with salt and pepper before serving.
