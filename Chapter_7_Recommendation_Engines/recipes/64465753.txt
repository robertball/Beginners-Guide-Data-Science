Ingredients:
1 lbs ground beef
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 small onion
1 green pepper
1 Tbsp corn starch
1 cup beef broth
1/4 cup A-1 steak sauce
2 tsp peppercorn steak seasoning
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
slice provolone or shredded mozzarella

Directions:
1.     Brown beef in a large skillet. Drain fat & set aside. In the same pan heat olive oil & saut√© onion & pepper for 4 minutes until starting to soften. Return beef to the pan with the vegetables.
2.     Whisk cornstarch into beef broth & add the steak sauce & beef broth/cornstarch mixture to the meat. Add steak seasoning, salt & pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed.
3.     Toast hamburger buns (if desired) & top with meat mixture & a slice of cheese. (I placed my slice of cheese in the warm pan with the meat, waited until it melted & scooped up the cheesy meat mixture onto my bun.)
