Description: 
A refreshing martini that will rival any good margarita. Fresh key limes give this drink an out-of-this world taste, but other fresh limes can be substituted. Remember that Key limes are only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of other limes (Do not use Key Lime juice in the bottle.) Freida's and Melissa's (Amazon) ship fresh key limes to your door. Google them.
