Ingredients:
sterilized jam jars with sealing lids
1 kilo (about 6 cups) fresh blueberries
1 kilo (about 6 cups) fresh blackberries
1 kilo sugar (with pectin)
juice of 2 lemons
2 tsp lemon rind

Directions:
Mix the berries, lemon juice, rind and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand at room temperature for an hour or two.
Put the berries into a heavy bottomed pot on the stove and bring slowly to a full boil over medium high heat, stirring frequently and mashing half the berries with a spoon or potato masher.
Boil for about 5 â€“ 10 minutes, stirring constantly.
Ladle the jam into sterilized jars, leaving about 1/8 of an inch space before sealing.
Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.
Remove from water and let cool completely, 12 to 24 hours.
Check the seals and any unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within 3-4 weeks.

Description: 
I had a bunch of fresh blackberries that I picked this summer, and decided to make jam.  I wanted to add another fruit to give it some more depth, and I chose blueberries.  This jam came out phenomenal.  Best jam I've made yet.
