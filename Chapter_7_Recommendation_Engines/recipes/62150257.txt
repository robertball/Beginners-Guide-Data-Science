Description: 
One Mug is enough for two servings, unless you are really in the mood for chocolate. This isn't a recipe to be thrown out, you must try this. The Men out there can fix this and the teenagers will love it.... Can make it any time in 5 minutes, that is total time, mixing and microwaving...
