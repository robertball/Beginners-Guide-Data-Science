Ingredients:
1 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ajinomoto®) (optional)
4 eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 bunch green onions, chopped
1/4 cup soy sauce (such as Aloha™ Shoyu)
10 cloves garlic, minced
5 pounds chicken wings
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Combine cornstarch, sugar, flour, salt, and monosodium glutamate in a large bowl. Add eggs, green onions, soy sauce, and garlic. Pat chicken dry and add to the sauce. Cover and refrigerate until marinated, 8 hours to overnight.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken in the hot oil until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
