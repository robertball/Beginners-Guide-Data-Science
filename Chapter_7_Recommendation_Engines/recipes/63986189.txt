Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups of cooked lentils
1 small onion, diced
1/4 cup of green or red bell pepper, diced
1/6 cup of italian bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup of shredded cheese of choice (or more)
1 teaspoon of minced garlic in olive oil
pinch of salt
pinch of black pepper
oil, for frying

Directions:
In a food processer, add in the lentils and process until coarse. In place of this step, you may just mash them by hand, but be careful not to make the mixture too smooth.
Transfer the lentils to a bowl and add in the onion, bell pepper, egg, and breadcrumbs and foil in.
Lastly, mix in the cheese and remaining seasonings. Then seperate the mixture into for equal parts.
Form the parts into balls and then flatten them to your preferred thickness.
Over medium-high heat, fry the patties in oil. For crispier patties, roll them in cornmeal and dry fry them in only around 1 tbsp of oil. Brown for about 5 minutes on each side.
