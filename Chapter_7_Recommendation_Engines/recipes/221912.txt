Spread salsa in a layer over the cream cheese mixture. Combine tomato, green pepper, and green onions in a bowl and spread the vegetables over the salsa. Cover the dip with Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
This dip is different from all of the ones online. I'm always asked to make it and it's always all eaten. I usually cut the recipe in half unless it's for a large group.
