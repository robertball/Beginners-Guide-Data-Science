Ingredients:
1 loaf sliced sourdough (2 slices per sandwich)
3+ lb Corned Beef Brisket or Round (with pickling seasoning)
1/2 head of cabbage
Fancy Mustard(spicy)
2 TBL olive oil
1 TBL vinegar (balsamic or red wine)
Salt & pepper

Directions:
Prepare corned beef as directed on package; don't forget to add the pickling seasoning that comes with it.
Take 1/2 head of cabbage and slice very thinly (as you would a tomato or onion). Place shredded cabbage into a salad bowl.
In a smaller bowl, mix 2 TBL olive oil, 1 TBL vinegar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and a dollop of fancy mustard. Whisk with fork until salad dressing is mixed thoroughly. Pour dressing over cabbage in salad bowl and toss until cabbage is coated well with dressing.
Take sliced sourdough and toast in oven or toaster. Once bread is toasted, shmear with fancy mustard.
Take toasted bread, then top with shredded cabbage. Second, top with shredded corned beef. Last, top with last slice of bread.  Enjoy.

Description: 
This new rendition of a reuben is amazing. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Toasted sliced-sourdough, shredded corned beef, fancy mustard, and shredded cabbage in a light vinigrette make this sandwich to die for (not just on Saint Patty's).
