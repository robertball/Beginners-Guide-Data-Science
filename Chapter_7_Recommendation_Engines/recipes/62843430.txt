Ingredients:
2 medium Russet potatoes
4 oz. butter (1/2 stick)
1/2 cup milk
Salt
Pepper
1 Chive, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Peel potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Place in medium saucepan with about 1 quart water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and continue cooking until a pointed knife slides into potato easily. Remove from heat and drain water from saucepan.
Slice butter and place in a microwave-safe bowl or cup. Microwave on high until melted, about 30 seconds. Add milk to melted butter and microwave one more minute at 20% power, until milk is warmed.
Rice potatoes into serving bowl, then fold in butter/milk mixture until combined.
If using a mixer, add butter/milk mixture to potatoes and mix on low until creamy, about 2 minutes in a stand mixer.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with chive and serve immediately.

Description: 
Silky creamy goodness! Russets work best here, but Yukon Gold may be substituted. 

For extra tang, replace half the milk with sour cream or mayonnaise. Either is yummy! For the silkiest potatoes, rice them, then stir in the butter and milk.
