Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 large egg, beaten
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix flour, chocolate chips, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Combine milk, egg, butter, and vanilla in a small bowl. Pour over flour mixture; stir only enough to blend.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
These gourmet pancakes are a decadent way to start the morning. They are a frequent request when my kids have friends stay overnight. They are very rich, yet light and fluffy. I find them great as is, but you are welcome to take breakfast to the extreme by adding whipped cream, sliced bananas, or chocolate syrup.
