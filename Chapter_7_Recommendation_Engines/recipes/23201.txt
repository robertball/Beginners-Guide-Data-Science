Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 pound crawfish, peeled
1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese food, cubed
1 cup half-and-half cream
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1 large tomato, chopped
1 pound dry fettuccini pasta
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet and saute the green onion, green pepper, and garlic until onions are opaque. Stir in flour and cook for 7 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add crawfish meat; cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Stir in the processed cheese, half and half, Cajun seasoning and tomato. Cover and simmer for another 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Mix together the sauce and pasta and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake for 20 minutes or until bubbly.
