Ingredients:
Struffoli:
4 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
Glaze:
1/2 cup honey, or more to taste
1/2 cup white sugar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon rainbow nonpareil sprinkles, or to taste

Directions:
Beat eggs, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; stir in baking powder. Slowly stir flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, into egg mixture until a soft dough forms. Roll dough into small balls.
Heat 2 cups vegetable oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or until you see little waves on the bottom of the saucepan.
Working in small batches, fry dough balls in the hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer struffoli to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
Heat honey in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Slowly mix 1/2 cup sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, into honey until sugar is melted and glaze is smooth, about 5 minutes.
Transfer struffoli to a large bowl and pour glaze over the top; toss quickly to evenly coat before glaze hardens.
Form struffoli into a tower-shape or Christmas tree-shape on a serving plate. Sprinkle nonpareils sprinkles over the struffoli.

Description: 
Struffoli are little balls of dough in a honey/sugar glaze, with nonpareil sprinkles. My grandma always made them for Christmas, but since she can't do it anymore, I came up with my own variation that she loves because mine are a little bit sweeter than the traditional bread-like ones. Also, they have to be formed into a tower...it's tradition.
