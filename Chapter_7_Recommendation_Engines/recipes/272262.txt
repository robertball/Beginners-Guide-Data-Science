Ingredients:
1 large jicama, peeled and grated
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place grated jicama in a mesh strainer and rinse under cold water for 2 minutes to remove excess starch. Drain for 5 minutes and squeeze out any additional moisture.
Combine jicama, parsley, onion powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper in a bowl; toss to coat.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add jicama mixture to skillet and flatten with a spatula. Cook for 8 minutes undisturbed. Flip and cook 4 additional minutes.
