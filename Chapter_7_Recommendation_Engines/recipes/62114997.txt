Ingredients:
6 oz Icing sugar
4 oz Unsalted butter
1 tablespoon Cocoa powder
1 tablespoon Whisky or Rum
Chocolate sprinkles or Cocoa powder

Directions:
Place the butter in a bowl with the icing sugar and mix until fluffy.
Add the cocoa and whisky/rum and continue to mix. (Adding more than 1 tablespoon of liquid will make it difficult to shape the mixture.)
Shape the mixture into balls, then roll in sprinkles/cocoa powder individually, and place them on a tray.
Refrigerate for 1 hour.
