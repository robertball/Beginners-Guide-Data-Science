Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 lime, juiced
8 tilapia fillets
1/4 cup honey-flavored Greek-style yogurt
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup shredded sweetened coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Drizzle lime juice over one side of each tilapia fillet; place the fillets with the juiced-side down into the prepared baking dish. Spread a thin layer of yogurt atop each fillet.
Mix pecans and coconut in a bowl. Divide equally between the tilapia fillets and lightly press mixture into the yogurt layer.
Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
