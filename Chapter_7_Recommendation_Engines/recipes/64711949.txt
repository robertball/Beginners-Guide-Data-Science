Ingredients:
•	1.5 lbs ripe, organic figs
•	1/3 cup water
•	1/8 ground multi-colored peppercorns
•	1 stick cinnamon
•	1/8 tsp ground allspice
•	1/4 cup coconut sugar
•	1/2 lemon, juiced
•	4 grams agar-agar

Directions:
1.	Gently wash the figs. Cut off the stems and chop them.
2.	Bring to a boil the chopped figs, water, ground peppercorns, cinnamon stick, and coconut sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil approximately ten minutes or until the figs begin to liquify. Turn down the heat and simmer, stirring often to break down the figs to the consistency desired (another fifteen minutes or until slightly thickened).
3.	While the jam is simmering, add the agar-agar to the lemon. Whisk well. Set aside to gel.
4.	After the jam has simmered, take it off the heat. Remove the cinnamon stick. Add the gelled lemon and agar-agar mixture and mix well.
5.	Allow to cool slightly. Put the jam into a 500ml jar with hermetic seal. Allow to cool completely before refrigerating. The jam will keep in the refrigerator about two weeks.
