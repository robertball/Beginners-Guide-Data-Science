Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 avocados - peeled, pitted and sliced
2 ripe tomatoes, sliced
4 sprigs of cilantro
1 (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 10 slices
marinade:
1/2 cup olive oil
2 T lime juice
2 T cilantro
1/4 chopped onion
1 garlic

Directions:
Combine olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, garlic, and onion in a ziplock bag and add chicken. Marinade the chicken for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Use marinade to saute chicken in skillet. Cook 10 minutes or until chicken is browned and just about done. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Place chicken on cookie sheet and top each breast with 1 to 2 slices of tomato, a sprig of cilantro, and 2 to 3 slices of cheese. Place in oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until cheese melts and chicken is done. Remove from oven, add 2 to 3 slices of avocado on top of each breast, and serve immediately.
