Ingredients:
•1/2 tbsp. ghee (substitute with oil if making vegan)
•1/2 tbsp. vegetable oil
•1 1/2 tsp. turmeric- divided
•chili powder, to taste (Korma is supposed to be a mild dish)
•2 tsp. garam masala
•1 tbsp. cumin powder
•1 medium potato- diced into 1/2 inch chunks
•1/2 c. carrots- sliced
•1/2 c. broccoli
•1 c. cauliflower
•1 c. green beans
•1 c. mushrooms
•1/2 c. paneer- diced (substitute tofu if making vegan)
•1 tbsp fenugreek leaves (fresh or dried)
•1/2 c. cashew nuts- plus more for garnish
•1 c. light coconut milk
•3 c. curry base (Recipe Here)
•2 heaping tbsp. Coconut  (preferably unsweetened)
•1 c. wateradded 1/2 c. at a time
•salt, to taste
•pepper, to taste
•2 tbsp. half & half- to finish (leave this out if making vegan)

Directions:
•Prepare all vegetables, thaw your curry base, get the blender ready and get ready to make some korma!
•In a large pan, heat 1/2 tbsp of oil and 1/2 tbsp ghee (if using) over med-high heat.  Once the oil gets hot, add 1/2 tsp. turmeric powder, a little chili powder, 2 tsp. garam masala, and 1 tbsp cumin powder.  Stir everything together until it begins to make a paste and the spices are cooked. Add the fenugreek leaves.
•Add the potatoes.  Stir-fry until the potatoes begin to get a little brown—they don’t need to cook all the way through, yet.
•Add all other vegetables and paneer (I usually add them straight from the freezer!) and stir-fry for about 3 minutes.  Add about 1 tsp. salt. Turn off the heat.
•Meanwhile—grab your blender.  Toss in 1/2 cup cashew nuts, 2 tbsp coconut and 1/2 c. water.  Blend until everything looks nice and smooth.
•To the blender, add 1 c. light coconut milk, 3c. curry base and 1 tsp. turmeric powder.  Blend until your gravy looks chunk-free and delicious! Taste it…if you feel it needs more coconut flavor, add a little more coconut and blend again.
•Pour the gravy into the pan with the vegetables.  Add 1/2 c. water into the empty blender and swish it around to loosen up whatever gravy was left behind.  Dump this in the pan too.  Turn the heat to about medium and let the curry simmer until the vegetables are cooked.  Stir often and add water if needed to prevent burning.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
•Once the vegetables are cooked–tender, but not mushy–toss in 2 tbsp. chopped cashew nuts and a small handful of golden raisins.  Finish with 2 tbsp. half and half (if using)-stir to combine. Garnish with chopped coriander.
•Serve with rice or rotis…and enjoy!
