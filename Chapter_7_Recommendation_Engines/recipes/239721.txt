Ingredients:
Brownies:
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix (such as PillsburyÂ®)
2/3 cup oil
2 eggs
1/4 cup water
Cheesecake:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water together in a bowl until well combined. Mix cream cheese, sugar, butter, flour, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.
Fill each muffin cup 1/2-full with brownie mix; top with cream cheese mixture. Spoon brownie mix over cream cheese mixture layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownie part comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Kind of like cheesecake-swirled brownies but made in cupcake cups. Easy to make with package brownie mix. Also cheesecake mix doesn't contain eggs.
