Ingredients:
tablespoons Kosher salt
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons whole coriander seeds
3 cloves garlic, peeled
2 tablespoons black peppercorns
1 pound of fresh jalapeno peppers, washed (you can use other hot peppers, as well, so feel free to experiment)
2½ cups of water
2½ cups of white distilled vinegar
3 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
1.Pickled Jalapeños
2.Adapted from Michael Symon’s Live to Cook by Michael Symon and Michael Ruhlman and DavidLebovitz.com
3.Puncture each pepper with a sharp knife (1x-2x is fine) and place in a large glass jar.
4.Bring the rest of the ingredients to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for five-ten minutes.
5.Pour the brine over the peppers (after removing from the heat) and place the lid on the jar. Once the container reaches room temperature, refrigerate for 7-10 days before consuming. All three writers, say the wait is worth it!
6.You can use this method on many hot / chile peppers, including japeños. The peppers keep about 7-10 days.
