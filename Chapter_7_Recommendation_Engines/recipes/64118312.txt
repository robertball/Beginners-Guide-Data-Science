Ingredients:
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 Tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 3/4 cup butter or 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.
* 1 1/4 cups buttermilk or 1 cup milk

Directions:
1)In a large bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar. Using a pastry blender or fork,cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the buttermilk all at once. Using a fork, stir just until moistened.
2)Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead dough by folding and gently pressing dough for 4 to 6 strokes or just until dough holds together. Pat or lightly roll dough until 3/4 inch thick. Cut the dough with a floured 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter.
3)Place biscuits 1 inch apart on an un-greased baking sheet. Bake in a 350-450 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden. Remove biscuits from baking sheet and serve immediately.
