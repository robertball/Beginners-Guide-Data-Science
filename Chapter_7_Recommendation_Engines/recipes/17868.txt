2 cups sauteed chopped onion
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large bowl combine the chicken, bread crumbs, 2 eggs and onion and mix well; if mixture is too dry to form patties, mix in another lightly beaten egg. Then add parsley, salt and pepper to taste, mix well and form into small patties.
