Ingredients:
1 medium sized (fist sized) potato
1 medium Onion chopped
1 TBSP flavored oil (I used Quintessence Garlic and Rosemary infused oil)
2 TBSP olive oil
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 TBSP instant potato mix

Directions:
Slice potatoes, not too thin (about 1/8")
Heat oils in a plate sized, non-stick pan over medium heat.
Spread potatoes in pan and cover.  Lightly brown potatoes.  When nearly cooked add onion, and let sweat in covered pan.
Meanwhile, beat eggs, milk and instant potato mix until fluffy.  (Instant potatoes will still appear not quite mixed in).
When just cooked, remove potatoes and onion from the pan to a plate.  There should still be enough oil left in the pan to cook the omelet with.
Add egg mixture to pan and cook for one minute.  Add potato mixture spreading evenly over egg mixture.  Cover and cook on low until omelet is nearly cooked through.
Slide omelet onto a plate and using oven mitts, place pan over plate and flip omelet into pan.  Continue to cook for a couple of minutes.
Remove to a plate and let sit for about 10 minutes before serving.

Delicious delicate flavored, light brown omelet sure to satisfy.  Serve with homemade salsa (if desired), crusty bread, sharp cheese and a good white wine.  Uses less oil, therefore lower in calories than most. Wonderful Sunday brunch dish.
