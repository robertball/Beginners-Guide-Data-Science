Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can golden mushroom soup (such as Campbell'sÂ®)
1 (10.75 ounce) can water
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat, trimmed

Directions:
Stir golden mushroom soup, water, onion, Worcestershire sauce, and onion soup mix together in a slow cooker; add beef and stir to coat.
Cook on Low for 6 hours.
Stir cream cheese and sour cream into the beef mixture.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in melted butter until tender, 3 to 5 minutes; add to beef mixture.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Ladle beef mixture over noodles to serve.

My cowboy's cute description of a great woman is that 'she has got biscuit dough on her bridle reins!' 
So, gals, your secret weapon is your slow cooker! Set it and forget it! You can be in two places at one time. This freezes well.
