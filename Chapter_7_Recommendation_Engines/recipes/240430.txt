Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir butter until foamy and butter begins to turn brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, pour butter into a thick glass or metal bowl, and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Stir brown sugar into cooled butter and mix until well blended; add eggs and vanilla extract and mix well. Slowly stir flour mixture into butter mixture just until dough is mixed. Form dough into small balls and slightly flatten with your hand or fork. Arrange cookies on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cookies are firm and edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
