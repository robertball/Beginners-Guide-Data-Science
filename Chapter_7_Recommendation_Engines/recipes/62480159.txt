Back to potato mixture... After 15 minutes are up, mash lightly and then add the milk mixture. Stir.
Drop teaspoon sized chunks of the rivels into the soup. Just a couple at a time stirring as you go as the rivels will clump together if done to quickly.

Description: 
This soup is my families favorite. Very thick and creamy. My dad used to make this for me when I was a child and now I make it for my children. It is perfect for a cold fall day!
