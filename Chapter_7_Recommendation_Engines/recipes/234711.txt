Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) links hot Italian sausage, casings removed
2 quarts chicken broth
1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/2 (8.5 ounce) package coleslaw mix
3 stalks celery, sliced
2 large potatoes, diced
2 large carrots, sliced
1/2 large onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 bay leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a stock pot over medium heat. Crumble sausage into the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the pot; add tomatoes, coleslaw mix, celery, potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir cream into individual servings.

Description: 
Just love this soup. I developed it to use up small quantities of veggies, and we fell in love with the flavors. For a less spicy soup, use regular italian sausage. For more heat, add some cayenne pepper and/or crushed red pepper flakes.
