Ingredients:
2 chicken breast
2 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1 can evaporated milk
1 cans, cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
1 lb spaghetti
2 cups cheddar cheese or monterey jack cheese

Directions:
Season chicken with Cajun seasoning and cook your preferred method. I normally bake mine for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.
Let the chicken rest before cubing or shredding.
Cook spaghetti based on package directions.
Mix together the milk, sour cream and soup until smooth and blended.
Stir chicken into mixture and then add the cooked spaghetti.
Pour mixture into a 13 X 8" baking dish.
Top with cheese and cover with aluminum foil.
Cook for 30 min at 350 degrees.
Remove foil and continue to cook for 5-15 minutes until cheese is melted and nicely browned.
Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
