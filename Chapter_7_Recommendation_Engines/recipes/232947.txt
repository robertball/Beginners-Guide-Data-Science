Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
2 1/2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar
3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon taco seasoning mix
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 hot dogs
8 hot dog buns, split and toasted

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add celery and onion; cover skillet and cook until celery and onion are tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir tomato soup, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into ground beef mixture; season with taco seasoning, garlic powder, and salt. Simmer mixture, stirring frequently, until flavors have blended, 15 to 20 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil; boil hot dogs in the boiling water until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove hot dogs from water using thongs.
Place each hot dog into a toasted bun; top each hot dog with ground beef mixture.

Description: 
This is a take off of sloppy joes. Not sure about the servings as I only cook for the 2 of us. Any extra I use on hamburger buns or it goes well on hash browns or egg with breakfast. I really find this makes a great hot dog! Enjoy.
