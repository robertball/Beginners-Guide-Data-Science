Ingredients:
1 12 ounce bag of fresh cranberries.
1 Medium Apple (Honeycrisp or Granny Smith).

1 Tablespoon of lemon juice
1 Cup of Sugar  (if doubling the recipe, I use about 1 1/2 Cups in total).

Directions:
Wash cranberries well. Discard any rotten ones.
Add cranberries to a large sauce pot.
Wash apple. Peel and chop.
Add Apple to pot.
Wash orange.
Zest orange into the cranberries.
Juice the orange into the cranberries.
Add sugar.
Stirring occasionally, cook on high until berries start to pop.
Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking and stirring.
Taste. Add more sugar if necessary.
Cook cranberries for about 20-30 minutes on medium low until the sauce thickens.
Refrigerate until Thanksgiving!

Description: 
This is a relatively new recipe to my Thanksgiving table as I always just opened a can, which I love! However, this is so easy and having it homemade is more special. I always double this recipe and it makes about 4 Cups. Don’t throw the zested and juiced orange from this recipe. Save it for the Cranberry Orange Relish!
