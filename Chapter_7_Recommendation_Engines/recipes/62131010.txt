Ingredients:
1 part grated dried lime zest (below)
1 part freshly-ground black peppercorns
1 part table salt

Directions:
Combine and store in an airtight jar. Use in recipes where you would use lemon pepper.
To make dried lime zest: zest your limes with a small-mesh grater and either leave the zest out to dry naturally or put it in a 200-degree oven for an hour or two, until it hardens up, then crush it with a mortar and pestle until it's small enough to use as a spice.

Description: 
A little different from lemon pepper, and even better because you make it yourself.
