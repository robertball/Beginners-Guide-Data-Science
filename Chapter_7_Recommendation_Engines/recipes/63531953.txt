Ingredients:
8 cups water; 2 bone in chicken breasts, uncooked and skin removed; 1 medium onion, chopped; 1 28 oz (796ml) can diced tomatoes, undrained; 1 large rib celery, diced; 1 green pepper, chopped;  1 10 oz (300 g) bag frozen okra, sliced;3/4 cup uncooked white rice; 3 Tbsp chicken bouillon; salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Cook chicken breasts in water in slow cooker, 4-5 hours on high, 7-10 hours on low 2. Remove meat from hot water, strain water into large stock pot with a fine strainer, this is now your broth. 3. When cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones and dice. Discard bones and cartilage. 4. Heat broth, adding onion, tomatoes, celery, green pepper, salt and pepper, and bouillon, tasting for saltiness. Bring to a boil then simmer on low 20 min or until veggies start to soften. 5. Add rice, okra, and chicken, and simmer 10 minutes longer.  6. Turn off heat and serve.  The slow cooking is the key to tender chicken and good stock.  Better the next day!
