Ingredients:
1 cup milk
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup vegetable shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract, or more to taste

Directions:
Cook milk and flour in a saucepan until thick and bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour into a bowl; place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Transfer cooled milk mixture into a large bowl. Add sugar, butter, shortening, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Whip frosting until creamy, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Light and creamy ermine frosting to compliment any cake. I use this instead of a cream cheese frosting on red velvet cake or cupcakes. The almond flavoring really compliments red velvet and offers an alternative if you're not fond of cream cheese frosting. It makes enough to frost 18+ cupcakes or a 3-layer cake.
