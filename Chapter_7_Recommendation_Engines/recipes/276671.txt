Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup mashed ripe banana, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 scoop cake-flavored 100% whey protein powder (such as Optimum Nutrition™ Gold Standard 100% Whey™)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
Cream brown sugar and 3/4 cup banana together in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Beat in remaining banana. Stir in vanilla extract.
Combine flour, protein powder, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and cloves in another bowl; stir into banana mixture. Mix in rolled oats.
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets; leave room for spreading.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
