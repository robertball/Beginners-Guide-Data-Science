Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat penne pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 zucchinis, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 carrots, diced
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
3 onions, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2/3 cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the zucchini, bell pepper, carrots, mushrooms, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute more. Stir in the tomatoes, chicken broth, parsley, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce thickens. Stir in the pasta and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Top with Parmesan and Gouda cheeses before serving.

Description: 
What better way to get your veggies in than with a savory Italian dish like Pasta Primavera. My version combines a little bit of heat from red pepper flakes with fresh vegetables, herbs and the smokey flavor of a smoked Gouda cheese. It's a wonderful combination of crunchy and creamy.
