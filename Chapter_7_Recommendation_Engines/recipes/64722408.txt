Ingredients:
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 Tbsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp onion powder
2 tsp ground dried thyme
8 oz dry spaghetti
4 chicken breasts, pounded thin
1 tsp EVOO
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Mix together spices for seasoning.  Prepare pasta, drain, add Parmesan cheese and set aside.
Coat chicken generously with approximately 4 Tbsp of seasoning (reserve remaining for future use). Saute chicken in 1 tsp of EVOO approximately 6-8 minutes, flipping occasionally to ensure it doesn't burn.
Remove chicken from pan, slice and serve atop pasta.
