Ingredients:
2 cups milk
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 cup sugar
1 cup shortening
2 teaspoons salt
6 eggs, beaten
9 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Heat milk to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Add yeast; stir until dissolved. In large mixing bowl, cream sugar, shortening and salt. Add eggs; mix well. Add half the flour; then add milk mixture, mixing until flour is moistened. Add remaining flour by hand. Turn out dough onto floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Divide dough into 4 parts. Roll each into a circle and brush with melted butter. Cut each circle into 16 pie-shaped pieces. Roll each piece into a crescent, starting at wide end. Place on baking sheet and freeze immediately.
When frozen, place in plastic freezer bags and seal. Store in freezer until for up to 4 weeks. To bake, place on greased baking sheet and cover; let rise until doubled, about 3-4 hours. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-15 minutes.

Description: 
I've made lots of homemade bread, but this recipe is my favorite - and my family's favorite, too! I usually triple the recipe and make a batch of dough ahead for holidays. I use this recipe to make cinnamon rolls, too.
