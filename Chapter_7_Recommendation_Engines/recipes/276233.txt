Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) box whole grain fettucine
2 tablespoons butter
6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
5 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
6 cups thinly sliced lacinto kale
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 ounce grated Romano cheese
4 lemon wedges

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.
While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until butter is browned and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic, anchovies, olive oil, thyme, and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add kale and cook, stirring, another 1 to 2 minutes. Add cooked fettuccini, 2/3 cup cooking liquid, and salt; toss to coat. Add remaining cooking liquid if pasta seems dry. Sprinkle with Romano cheese and serve with lemon wedges.
