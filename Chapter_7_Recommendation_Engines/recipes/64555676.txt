Ingredients:
3 large egg whites
1/4 tsp mint extract
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup organic coconut oil
1/4 cup organic maple syrup
1/4 cup creamy almond butter
1/4 cup coconut sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup dairy free chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8x8 brownie pan with cooking spray.
Using a standing mixer or hand mixer, mix together egg whites, mint extract, salt, maple syrup and coconut sugar. Once it is mixed together, add cocoa powder and blend until a creamy texture appears. You may need to scrap down the sides of the bowl a few times to mix everything.
Next add coconut oil and almond butter into the batter and mix by hand.
Fold in the chocolate chips then pour the batter into your baking pan.
Place in the oven and bake 30 minutes until a toothpick removes clean.
Allow brownies to cool in the pan another 30-60 minutes prior to slicing with a plastic knife and enjoying.
