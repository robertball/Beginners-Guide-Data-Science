Ingredients:
1 (29 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup butter, chilled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Layer the peaches in a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Slice the butter into chunks and mix it into the dry ingredients until it looks like pea size crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over peaches.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly golden.

Description: 
My family actually calls this peach cobbler but the crispy shortbread-type crust makes it a crisp. Very good with ice cream or sprinkled with pecans before baking.
