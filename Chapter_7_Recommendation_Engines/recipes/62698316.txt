Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
1 egg, whipped
1 tsp of powdered onion
Or Â½ cup of fresh minced onion
1 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp rosemary
1 Tbl Italian parsley
1 tsp Oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper
3 Tbl barbecue sauce (use gluten free if applicable)
2 Tbl ketchup (I like to use low sugar or No HFCS) or tomato sauce
1/4 cup bread crumbs (for gluten free use GF corn flake crumbs)
Ketchup or tomato sauce for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Prepare muffin tin, spray with Pam.
In medium bowl, combine all ingredients up to bread crumbs.  Stir well until combined.  Add bread crumbs.  Add in additional add-ins if preferred.  Mixture should be a moist consistency that binds well with bread crumbs.  Fill muffin tins 3/4 way full (should fill 10-12 tins).  Use teaspoon or thumb to make small indentation into each meatloaf.  Fill indentation with ketchup or tomato sauce.  Bake 25-30 minutes.

Description: 
These mini meatloaves are fun to eat, cook quickly, and have a little crust around the edges which make them taste even better!  I alter my recipe for gluten free, but you can make it with bread crumbs if you prefer.
