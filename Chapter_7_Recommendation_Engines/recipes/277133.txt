Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1/2 (16 ounce) package bacon
1 cup chicken stock
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup frozen peas
ground black pepper to taste
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towel and chop into small pieces when cool enough to handle.
Drain bacon fat from the pan and discard. Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and pour in chicken stock and sour cream. Cook and stir over medium heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add peas and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in shredded mozzarella cheese until well combined and melted. Season with pepper. Add cooked pasta and toss until covered in sauce. Mix in bacon pieces.
Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and more pepper, if desired.

Description: 
While attempting to make a carbonara with no eggs I found my sauce a little runny, adding cheese to the sauce made it perfect!
