Ingredients:
1/3 cup shortening
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped pistachios, or more to taste
1/2 cup coconut flakes, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Combine shortening, butter, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat slowly into the shortening mixture until thoroughly combined. Mix pistachios and coconut flakes into the dough using a large spoon or your hands until evenly distributed.
Drop heaping spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto 2 baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are a light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I altered my mom's famous chocolate chip cookie recipe to accommodate two of my favorite flavors, coconut and pistachio. These crunchy-on-the-outside, chewy-on-the-inside cookies have been a huge hit ever since and one of my favorite to make. Hope you enjoy!
