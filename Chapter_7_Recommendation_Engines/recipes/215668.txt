Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) package whole-wheat penne pasta
¼ cup olive oil
½ whole head garlic, slivered
½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 bunches baby broccoli (such as Broccolini(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 (14.5 ounce) can fava beans, rinsed and drained
¼ cup sun-dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta in boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the garlic and red pepper flakes in the hot oil briefly, about 1 minutes. Stir the broccolini into the garlic; cook and stir together for 5 minutes. Add the fava beans and sun-dried tomatoes and cook until the beans are completely warmed, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and toss with the drained pasta in a large bowl. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese to serve.
