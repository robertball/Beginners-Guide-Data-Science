In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear.  Let rest until cool enough to handle, then shred with two forks.  Set aside 4 cups of shredded meat.
In a medium pot with boiling salted water cook elbow macaroni until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl mix together the cooked chicken, drained vegetables, shredded lettuce, and mayonnaise. Add basil, pepper, salt, and garlic powder to taste.
