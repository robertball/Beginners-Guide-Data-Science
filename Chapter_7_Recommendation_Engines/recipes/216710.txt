Ingredients:
8 red potatoes
1/2 onion, chopped
6 ounces Cheddar cheese curds, diced
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Let the potatoes cool enough to handle, and peel; allow the potatoes to cool thoroughly. Cut into bite-size pieces.
In a bowl, combine the potatoes, onion, cheese curds, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, and seasoned salt; mix thoroughly. Top the potato salad with hard-boiled egg slices and sprinkle with black pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
As a native Wisconsinite, I love cheese curds.  I also love potato salad.  Cheese curds are one of those food items that you won't find in all grocery stores nationwide, but you could substitute with chunks of cheddar cheese.
