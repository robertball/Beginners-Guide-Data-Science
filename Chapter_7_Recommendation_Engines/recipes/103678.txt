Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup lime juice
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, pressed
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 pounds flank steak
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
8 burrito size (about 10-inch) flour tortillas
fresh lime wedges

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat while preparing marinade and steak. Mix Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, and pressed garlic in a medium bowl; set aside. In a small bowl, mix together chili powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Rub steak  with 1 tablespoon of oil, and sprinkle with chili powder mixture.
A couple of minutes from sauteing, increase heat under skillet to medium-high. Add beef; saute, turning once until well browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to bowl with marinade; toss to coat.  Add remaining tablespoon of oil to the hot skillet, along with onions and red pepper; saute until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
When ready to serve, cut steak into bite-size strips. Fill warm tortillas with steak,  some of the marinade, peppers and onions. Serve with lime wedges.
