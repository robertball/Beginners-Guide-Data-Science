Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
2 tablespoons sugar
SHORTCAKE:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cold butter
3 tablespoons 2% milk
1 egg yolk, beaten
3/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel
LEMON BUTTER:
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel
WHIPPED CREAM:
1/3 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine strawberries and sugar; cover and refrigerate until serving.
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine the milk, egg yolk and lemon peel; stir into crumb mixture until a soft dough forms (dough will be sticky).
Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 10 times. Divide dough in half. Gently pat or roll each half into a 3/4-in.-thick circle. Place 2 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack; cool for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine butter and lemon peel; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Add sugar; beat until stiff peaks form.
To assemble, split shortcakes in half. Place cake bottoms on dessert plates; spread with lemon butter, then top each with a fourth of the strawberries and whipped cream. Cover with shortcake top and remaining berries and cream.
