Ingredients:
1 tube crescent rolls  (Use a name brand for best quality results!)
4 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1 Jar or can of your favorite fruit filling (see photos for pics of filling I used)
Glaze:
1/4 cup powdered sugar
enough milk or water to make a drizzle about 1 - 2 tsp to start (kinda have to gauge for yourself - everyone likes it differently) add more water if necessary.  If to runny just add a bit more powdered sugar until you are happy with the flow.

Directions:
Separate dough into 4 rectangles on a lightly floured surface. Pat one of the rectangles together to seal openings in dough.  Stretch out until about 7 -8 inches long.
In small bowl mix the cream cheese with the sugar and extract until creamy.
Spread mixture over the dough keeping ends uncovered.
Roll up starting at long side.
Coil dough loosely and pinch end to hold together.
Place coil on ungreased cooking sheet.  (I use parchment paper - helps with clean up too!) Flatten down slightly making a bit of an indent in the center.  Be gentle as not to puncture dough.  Place 1 tablespoon fruit filling in center of dough coil.  Bake 350* for about 15 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from cooking sheet and cool.
Mix glaze until desired consistency and drizzle generously over danish.
ENJOY!

What's for dinner, mom?
Description: 
Just as good as danish from the bakery.  Light and sweet - ALWAYS a crowd pleaser.  You can substitute soy cream cheese if you have lactose issues.
