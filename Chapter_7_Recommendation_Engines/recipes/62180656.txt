Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup rolled oat, quick cooking
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
3 teaspoons cinnamon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups fat-free buttermilk
1/2 cup dried cherries (or cranberries, whatever you prefer)
1/4 cup fat free egg substitute
2 tablespoons canola oil (or vegetable oil)
2 tablespoons wheat germ

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
Combine the flour, cornmeal, oats, brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center.
Combine the buttermilk, cherries (or cranberries), egg substitute and oil in a small bowl, beating with a whisk until blended. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture, folding with a rubber spatula just until the flour mixture is moistened.
Fill the muffin cups evenly with the batter; sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons of cinnamon sugar and the wheat germ. Bake until a toothpick intserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
Cool in the pan 5 minutes. Unmold the muffins and cool completely.
