Ingredients:
5 cups hot, drained, boiled macaroni (aldente)
3 tbsp butter or margarine, melted
2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
3 large eggs
3 cups milk
1/3 cup Kraft grated parmesan cheese
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 tsp brown mustard
2 dashes of hot sauce (like Tabasco)
1/2 cup fresh parsley (optional)
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1 level tbsp black pepper
1 tsp salt
Paprika

Directions:
In large bowl add macaroni, butter and cheese; mix well.
Turn macaroni mixture into 2, 4 quart baking dishes sprayed with non-stick cooking spray; spread it evenly in dishes but do not pack it down.
In food processor, add remaining ingredients (except paprika) blending until smooth.
Pour blender mixture evenly over both dishes of macaroni.
Sprinkle them with paprika.
Bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until set in the middle.
Let stand 5 minutes before serving. (I serve one and freeze the other for another nights dinner)

Description: 
This is a simple and inexpensive version of an old favorite. Just like grandma used to bake. It tastes much like the dish that Putches Cafeterias used to serve long ago. If you really want to take it back a few decades - add a can of drained petite diced tomatoes to the macaroni mixture before baking.
