2 cloves garlic
1 chicken breast
2 links sausage
1 cup ham, diced
Spices:
1 tsp salt, 1 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp mustard powder, 1 tsp cayenne1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves.

Directions:
Sautee all in olive oil in a skillet till brown.
While that is sauteeing, in a small bowl, mix 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp mustard powder, 1 tsp cayenne (more or less to taste) 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves.
Pour spice mixture over meat/veg in skillet and stir to combine. When meat and veg are browned, transfer to crock pot.
Add 1 SMALL can V8 juice, 2 bay leaves, and 1 cup chicken stock.
Cook on low. 1 hr before you're ready to eat, add 1 cup rice and just enough stock to cover everything with liquid.
Stir and replace cover.
30 minutes later, stir again, and again add just enough stock to make sure everything is covered. After another 30 minutes, rice should be done.
If it's still soupy, cook on high w/ the lid off till it gets to the consistency you like it.
