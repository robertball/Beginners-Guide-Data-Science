Description: 
From Vegan Brunch by Isa Chandra Moskowitz. These waffles have a malted, toasty taste, crispy outside and more tender inside.  The barley malt syrup and cornmeal achieve those flavors and textures, respectively.  Maple syrup can be used instead of barley malt syrup, but the waffles will have a a slightly sweeter, but totally good, flavor.
