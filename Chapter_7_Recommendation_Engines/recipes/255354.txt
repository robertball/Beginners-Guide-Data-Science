Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 1 muffin tin.
Whisk chickpea flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl. Make a well in the center; add applesauce, molasses, egg, butter, and vanilla extract. Stir until just combined. Fold carrots into the batter.
Spoon batter into the muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out slightly wet, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe trying to increase the iron and fiber in my diet. You can substitute just about any veggie or fruit for the carrots. These muffins freeze well.
