Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup warm milk
1 egg
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2.5 tsp yeast
1/4 cup butter, softened

Directions:
. Mix the warm water, warm milk and yeast first. Let it stand for about 10 minutes for the yeast to proof. Then add the remaining ingredients. Let it rise until doubled in size (about 1hr.) Then follow the rest of the recipe. My husband and boys arm wrestle for the last one. This recipe is also wonderful for cinnamon rolls. Happy Baking!
When cycle finishes, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12 inch circle, spread 1/4 cup softened butter over entire round. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. Roll wedges starting at wide end; roll gently but tightly. Place point side down on ungreased cookie sheet. Cover with clean kitchen towel and put in a warm place, let rise 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden.
