Ingredients:
1 3/4 pounds beef sirloin steak
2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and pepper
1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 heads romaine lettuce - rinsed, dried, and torn into bite-size pieces
1 bunch watercress, rinsed and dried
3 roma tomatoes, diced
1 small red bell pepper, sliced
1/2 cup sliced red onion
1 English cucumber, peeled and diced
1/2 cup sliced pimento-stuffed green olives

Directions:
Preheat grill for high heat.  Lightly season both sides of the steak with garlic powder, and salt and pepper.
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, lime juice, garlic, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix in the cheese. Cover and place dressing in refrigerator.
Lightly oil grate. Place steak on grill and cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side or until desired doneness is reached. Remove from heat and let sit until cool enough to handle. Slice steak into bite-size pieces.
Combine the lettuce, watercress, tomatoes, pepper, red onion, cucumber and olives. Toss with dressing. Place salad onto chilled plates and top with steak.
