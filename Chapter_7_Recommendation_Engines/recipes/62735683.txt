Ingredients:
2 cups Bisquick baking mix
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp lemon juice
1 1/2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
Whipped cream (optional)

Directions:
Mix baking mix, milk, egg, vanilla, cinnamon and sugar in a medium bowl. Add baking soda and lemon juice.
Fold in 1 cup of the shredded coconut.
Heat a pan to medium/high heat. Once heated, spray with non-stick cooking spray.
Pour in pancake batter in 1/4 cup increments. Sprinkle some coconut from the remaining 1/2 cup onto the uncooked side of the pancake before flipping. (This will give you a toasted coconut crust.) Repeat with remaining batter and coconut.
Serve with whipped cream, if you like.
