Ingredients:
2 tablespoons margarine or butter
1 cup chopped onion
3  leeks, sliced
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1 cup finely chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 ½ cups rolled or quick cooking oats
1  egg, beaten
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Melt the margarine in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and leeks, and cook until softened. Stir frequently. When the leeks and onions are soft, stir in the breadcrumbs, nuts, sage, oats, and egg until well blended. Remove from heat immediately, and allow to cool.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Shape the mixture into 6 large fat sausages. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the sausages until browned on all sides. Remove them from the skillet, and place them on a baking sheet. Brush the sausages with oil.
Roast the sausages in the oven for 25 minutes, or until browned. Serve hot.
