Ingredients:
2/3 cup of sour cream
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 lemon
1 egg
4 cups of flour
1 cup of white sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 cup of dried cranberries, sweetened
1 cup of margarine or butter
***GLAZE***
2 Cups confectioners sugar
2 tbsp Cream
1/2 tsp lemon extract

Directions:
preheat oven to 350F
Mix the baking soda and the sour cream together.
Whisk all your dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Add your butter and cut in until it’s crumbly.
Take your lemon and grate the peel off of it into the flour mixture.
Cut your lemon in half, and squeeze all the juice out, picking out the seeds that inevitably fall into it. They always do, I haven’t mastered juicing a lemon and not having all the seeds end up in the juice too.
You should get almost a 1/4 cup of lemon juice.
Add in enough milk to bring it to 1/3 of a cup. Don’t worry if the milk curdles.
Mix the sour cream, milk and egg into the dry ingredients.
Once it’s mixed a bit, add in the cranberries.
Divide into three balls, then flatten into 6 inch disks. Cut each piece into 6 triangles.
Bake in a 350 degree oven and bake them until they are golden brown, from 15-20 minutes depending on your oven
let cool on racks then coat with lemon glaze
