Ingredients:
3 c. hot mashed potatoes (I just cook up a few and mash them, I don't measure)
1 c. shredded cheddar cheese, divided
1 egg
1 2.8oz. can Durkee French Fried Onions
1 1/2c. cut up cooked chicken
1 10 oz. pkg. mixed veges (I had 3 left over veges in the frig and used those)
1/2 cut up onion (optional)
1 (10 3/4 oz) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1/4 c. milk (we were out so I used water)
1/2 tsp. ground mustard (optional)
1/4 tsp. garlic powder (optional)
1/4 tsp. ground pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 375.  In a medium bowl combine potatoes and egg and half the cheese. Mix thoroughly.  Spoon into greased 9" pie plate, spreading across bottom and up sides to form a shell.  In a large bowl combine chicken, vegetables, onion if wanted, soup, milk and seasonings.  Pour into potato shell.  Bake uncovered 30 minutes, covered with an aluminum tent, or until heated through.  Top with remaining cheese and French Fried Onions and bake, uncovered until onions are golden brown.  Let stand 5 minutes and serve.

Description: 
This is unusual as it uses mashed potatoes for the crust in a pie plate.  Very easy.  I took the original and made it my own.  Great by itself or with bread or a salad.  My family loves it and always comments on how good the house smells when I make it!
