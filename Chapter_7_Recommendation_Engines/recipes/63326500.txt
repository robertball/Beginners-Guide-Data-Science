Ingredients:
Summer Squash - zucchini, patty pan, whatever you have
1 c, onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 large tomato, chopped
1 cup black beans
1/2 cup corn
1 cup chicken stock
8 oz. Chorizo, cooked and crumbled
1 oz. cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Cut open squash and scoop out seeds.
Place squash cut-side down in a baking dish. Pour 1 cup water into the pan. Bake for 30 minutes @ 350 degrees or until soft.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large sautee pan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes, or until onion softens and begins to brown. Add pepper, and cook another 3-4 minutes to allow it to soften slightly. Add beans, corn, and stock. Cook for about 10 minutes or until liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chorizo.
Divide bean and chorizo mixture between squash. Top with cheese and return to oven for 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
