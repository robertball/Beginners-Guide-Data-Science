Title:
Tofu & Plantain  Medley Veggie Patties Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup of cubed tofu
1/2 cup of canned sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup of black olives
1 plaintain peeled and sliced (medium to small)
1/2 cup of sun dried tomatos
1  1/4 cup of chopped zuchinni
1/2 cup of bread crumbs
1 large garlic clove
butter (as needed)

Directions:
Take all these ingredients and put them in a food processor and leave it on until it becomes a thick texture that's free of any real chunkiness at all. You may see flecks but there shouldn't be any chunks. Spoon it out into your hand with a serving spoon. Mold into patties and place on a hot (cast iron skillet) pan with butter. As they start to brown flip them over and press them down gentley. When they start to brown or get dark like pancakes (pancake marked) remove from the skillet. They should be moist and easy to eat, they shouldn't fight back (toughness) no matter how much you cook them. They taste out of site and waiting to eat them or serve them is a killer. If you want them more 'burger like' I would suggest adding more breadcrumbs.

Description: 
This is an amazing and dazzling array of flavors packed into a pattie. It literally dances in your mouth. These are better than store patties or restaurant patties any day of the week. They're not heavy and I couldn't stop eating them, I think I took them to work and ate them all myself -straight- They'd be great in a pita or with wedged cut wraps with yogurt.
