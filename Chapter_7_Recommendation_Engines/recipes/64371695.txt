Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup water
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon ground paprika (optional)
5 pounds skinless chicken thighs

Directions:
Whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, garlic, onion, black pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, and paprika in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken thighs, and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Grill the chicken thighs on the preheated grill until cooked through, about 15 minutes per side.
