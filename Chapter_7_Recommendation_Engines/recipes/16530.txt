Ingredients:
4 potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 clove garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup red enchilada sauce

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium mixing bowl, combine mashed potatoes, 3/4 cup cheese, chili powder, cumin, garlic, salt and pepper. Spoon evenly into tortillas, and roll up. Place rolled tortillas side by side in a 8x8 inch baking pan. Spread enchilada sauce evenly over the top, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.

Description: 
You can use any kind of chili pepper you like - I like poblano or chipotle the best. Buy them dried and put them in your blender to make powder!  Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream if desired. You can substitute taco sauce for enchilada sauce.
