Ingredients:
1 large zucchini, thickly sliced
4 ounces button mushrooms, quartered
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups couscous
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat your grill to a high heat, outdoor or indoor.
Brush vegetables lightly with olive oil, and place them on the grill. Cook, flipping over occasionally, until just tender.
While the vegetables are grilling, bring water, salt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and couscous to boil in a large pot. Once the water has come to a boil, remove the pot from the heat and let it stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a  fork when done. Let couscous cool to room temperature.
Place couscous on a plate and top with veggies. Drizzle with a small amount of olive oil and Balsamic vinegar.
