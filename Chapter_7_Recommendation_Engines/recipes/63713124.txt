Ingredients:
For the puree:
1 head of cauliflower
2 Tbsp heavy cream
1 Tbsp butter
1/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
1 Tbsp (or more) chopped chipotles in adobo sauce (canned)
1/4 tsp garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
For the casserole:
1/2 cup salsa verde
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup chopped raw tomatoes
1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapenos (optional)
1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
For the puree:
Clean and trim the cauliflower, breaking it into medium sized pieces. Place in a microwave safe bowl with 2 Tbsp of cream and 1 Tbsp of butter. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 10 minutes. Stir to coat cauliflower with cream/butter mixture. Microwave for another six – eight minutes on high (or until cauliflower is tender). Remove from the microwave and put into a high speed blender or food processor along with the cheese. Puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
For the casserole:
Spread the puree in an 8 x 8 casserole dish. Spread on the sour cream, then the salsa verde. Sprinkle the chopped tomatoes and jalapenos on top. Cover with the shredded cheese.
Bake in the oven for 30 – 40 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
