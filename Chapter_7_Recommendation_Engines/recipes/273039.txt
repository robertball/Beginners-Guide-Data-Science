Description: 
This healthier version of the original chocolate chip cookie is still chewy and full of flavor. I came up with this recipe on my own so that I could feel a little less guilty about snacking on my favorite sweet treat. Unfortunately, I think they are so delicious that I tend to eat more than I should!
