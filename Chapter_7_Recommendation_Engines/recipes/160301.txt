Ingredients:
1 pound boneless venison roast, thinly sliced across the grain
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon grill seasoning
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 cups beef broth
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season the venison with garlic, grill seasoning, and chili powder. Place into a casserole dish, and pour in the beef broth. Cover the dish with a lid, and bake in preheated oven until the venison is tender, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter begins to bubble, whisk in the flour. Cook while whisking constantly until the flour turns a golden yellow, and the bubbling slows, about 10 minutes.
When the venison has finished cooking, whisk 1 1/2 cups of the broth from the venison roast into the flour roux, and simmer for 15 minutes, whisking frequently. Add the venison to the gravy and serve.

Description: 
This is my favorite way to prepare a venison roast, it's quick and easy, and even works with the not-so-tender cuts.
