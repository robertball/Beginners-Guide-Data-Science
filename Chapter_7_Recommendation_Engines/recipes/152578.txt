Ingredients:
2 cups spelt flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. You may need to adjust the amount of milk. Pat out on a floured surface to about 1 inch thick. Cut into biscuits and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown.

Description: 
I have made these biscuits for health nuts and non healthy eaters alike, but there are never leftovers.  These are heavier on account of the spelt flour, but the nutty whole grain flavor is divine. Best when served fresh out of the oven, eaten with butter and honey or jam.
