Title:
Grandma Moyer's Rhubarb / Strawberry Coffee Cake Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 Cups Sugar
2 eggs
1 Cup cold coffee
3 Cups flour
2 TS baking soda
2 TS Cinnamon
1/2 TS salt
3 Cups chopped raw Rhubarb
1 1/2 Cups sliced Strawberries
1/2 Cup Brown Sugar
1/2 Cup chopped Pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 9" x 13" cake pan.  I like to get the Rhubarb and Strawberries ready first so that they are ready to be added at the right time.
Cut up your Rhubarb.  I know a lot of people have never used Rhubarb.  All you have to do is trim both of the ends and wash it.  Cut it up like you would celery.  You want to look for Rhubarb that isn't too "woody".  It should be crunchy and moist.
Clean and cut up your strawberries.
Cream together the white sugar and eggs in one bowl, then add the coffee.
Mix all of the dry ingredients in another bowl.
Add the dry ingredients to the sugar/eggs/coffee mixing just enough to incorporate everything.
Fold the rhubarb and strawberries into the batter.
Pour the batter into the cake pan.
Sprinkle with brown sugar and chopped nuts.
Bake in 350 degree oven for 45-50 minutes.

Description: 
This was my Grandma Moyer's recipe.  It has been missing since at least the mid 80's.  I found it stuck the middle of an old book I got after my mom passed away.  Everyone in the family has been trying to recreate this delicious coffee cake for years.  It is moist and very flavorful.  I added the strawberries because I like it a little sweeter.  Rhubarb is an ingredient that you don't see used very often any more, but those of us who do use it always love to find new ways to spread the love.
