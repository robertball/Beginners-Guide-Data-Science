Ingredients:
1 (8 oz) brick of cream cheese
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 (10 oz) brick of cheddar cheese (crumbled or shredded)
1 (8 oz) brick of feta cheese (crumbled)
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
2 tsp onion powder
3 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp garlic powder
1/4 cup whole or halved pecans
1/4 cup and 1/2 cup whole pine nuts (separated)

Directions:
In a bowl, combine cream cheese, mayonnaise, and vinegar.  Stir or use a food processor until the cream cheese softens to a smooth consistency.
In another bowl, combine the remaining cheeses and the herbs.  Stir until mixed, then stir into the cream cheese mixture.
In the bowl of a food processor or blender, combine pecans and 1/4 cup pine nuts.  Blend to small pieces.  The nuts should have a crumbly texture.  Mix in 1/2 cup whole pine nuts and spread 1/4 of the mixture onto a plate.
Form cheese mixture into two balls (approximately 5" in diameter).  Place on plate and roll in nut mixture, adding more of the nut mixture as needed.
When rolled, place balls in the center of a serving platter and surround with your favorite cracker.  For a true "Greek" theme, try toasted pita chips.

Description: 
I just wasn't satisfied with the ingredients in other cheese ball recipes.  So, I made my own and took it to a Christmas party, where it was enjoyed by all.
