2 fluid ounces bourbon whiskey
1/2 teaspoon brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand MarnierÂ®)

Description: 
We drink this year-round but invented it over the holidays, when we had mounds of homemade cranberry sauce in the fridge. It evolved from a Champagne and fresh berry compote drink that we saw being made at Portland's Clyde Common. We subbed bourbon and experimented until we arrived at this delicious mix.
