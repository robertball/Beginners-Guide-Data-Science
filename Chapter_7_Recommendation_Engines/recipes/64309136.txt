Description: 
I don't have a real sweet tooth so I wanted to make a dessert that wasn't too decadent. We love these tarts because they're just enough sweet with that unique pear taste and the crunch of almonds. A lot like apple pie. For those of you who make your own pie crust, it will make them that much better!!! I think these would pear well with your favourite cup of tea or a bubbly glass of Prosecco ;) Enjoy!
