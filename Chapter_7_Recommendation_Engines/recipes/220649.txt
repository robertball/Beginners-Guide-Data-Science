Ingredients:
2 (8.5 ounce) packages dry corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 eggs
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix corn muffin mix, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl until blended.
Stir eggs and evaporated milk into dry ingredients until moistened.
Stir cream-style corn into mixture to make a moist batter. Let batter stand while oil heats.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Gently drop a teaspoon of batter at a time into the hot oil, staying as close to the oil as possible to avoid splattering. Fry hush puppies until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch.
Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt if desired.

Description: 
I don't normally like hush puppies. They are generally too dry, too dense, and too bland for my taste. After tasting some in a restaurant that I actually liked, I decided to come up with a recipe of my own. This one deliberately uses stuff right out of the pantry so that it can be whipped up quickly and served fast.
