Description: 
These two root vegetables blend for a side dish with enough character to hold the spotlight next to grilled or roasted meat, poultry, or fish. The hint of vinegar, Dijon, honey, and thyme will make you forget it's actually good for you. Skip-a-step by lining the vegetable roasting pan with aluminum foil. To line the pan fast, turn pan upside down and press sheet of aluminum foil around it. With aluminum foil, you can use either shiny side up or dull side up. Remove the aluminum foil. Turn over, drop foil inside. Crimp edges and you're ready to cook. After the meal there is no extra cleanup. Just toss the foil.
