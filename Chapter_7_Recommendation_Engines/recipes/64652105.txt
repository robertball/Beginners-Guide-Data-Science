Description: 
This quick and easy soup had been a family favorite for years. I usually double the recipe for my guys. I use A LOT more cayenne pepper sauce than written, but the guys like it really spicy, so you can start with 1 teaspoon and go from there. I know it's not an 'authentic' recipe, but we love it, enjoy!
