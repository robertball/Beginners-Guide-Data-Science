Ingredients:
2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped onions
1 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
2 garlic cloves minced
1 pound extra lean ground turkey
1/2 cup uncooked couscous or breadcrumbs
1 egg
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
salt & Pepper
1/2 cup barbecue sauce, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 20 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Place zucchini, onions,garlic and red bell pepper into a food processor, and pulse several times until finely chopped but not liquefied. Place the vegetables into a bowl, and mix in ground turkey, couscous, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and Dijon mustard until thoroughly combined. Fill each prepared muffin cup about 3/4 full. Top each cup with about 1 teaspoon of barbecue sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Internal temperature of a muffin measured by an instant-read meat thermometer should be at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
