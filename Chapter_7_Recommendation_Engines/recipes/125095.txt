Description: 
A chilled fluffy dessert like this one is a satisfying way to finish off a big meal. I got the recipe from a woman I happened to meet in a department store one day. Leftovers taste just as good the next day, and this dessert also can be frozen.                                   -- Eunice Stoen, Decorah, Iowa
