Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed well
1 medium zucchini
1 teaspoon olive oil
3/4 cup sambal oelek (Indonesian chile sauce), divided
1 small red onion, finely chopped
2 large egg whites
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound ground skinless turkey breast
3 tablespoons stone-ground mustard

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Shred the zucchini using a cheese grater over a lint-free kitchen towel. Wrap the zucchini in the towel and wring out as much water as possible.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and swab with olive oil.
Place the zucchini in a large bowl. Add 1/4 cup chile sauce, red onion, egg whites, garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Add quinoa and turkey; mix well to combine. Divide mixture into 6 parts and shape into small loaves. Space them evenly on the baking sheet.
Combine the remaining 1/2 cup chile sauce with mustard. Spread a heaping spoonful over each loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaves are hot on the inside and sauce has darkened in color, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest, at least 5 minutes.
