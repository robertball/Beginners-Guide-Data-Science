Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 pork loin chops, 1/2 inch thick
1/2 cup lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1/2 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Brown pork chops about 5 minutes per side.
Mix lemon juice, garlic, paprika, thyme, and cayenne pepper into the skillet. Cover, and simmer 20 minutes, cooking the chops to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove pork chops from the skillet, and set aside. Over high heat, reduce the remaining liquid for about 5 minutes. Return pork chops to the skillet briefly, coating them on both sides with the reduced mixture.
