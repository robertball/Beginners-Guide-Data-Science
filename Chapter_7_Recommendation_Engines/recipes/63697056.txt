Ingredients:
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup flour (Almost any will work, but not coconut flour) (42g)
1/3 cup xylitol or brown sugar (You can use a liquid sweetener. It’ll just be a bit gummy) (53g)
2 nunaturals stevia packs, or 2 extra tablespoons brown sugar
1 (15-oz) can pumpkin puree
3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp milk of choice (210g)
2 tbsp oil, or omit and increase milk to 1 cup
1 tsp ener-g powder or 1 tablespoon ground flax (a commenter said cornstarch works, but I haven’t personally tried it.)
2 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F, and grease a 10-inch round pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine first 7 ingredients, and stir very well. In a separate bowl, combine all liquid ingredients with the energ or flax, and whisk. Pour wet into dry, stir to combine, then pour into the pan and bake 35 minutes. (It’ll still be gooey after baking, but that’s ok.) Allow to cool completely before transferring uncovered to the fridge to “set” for at least 6 hours before trying to slice.

Description: 
You could actually eat the entire 8 servings of pie and still consume less fat and fewer calories than if you ate just one slice of many traditional pies.
Not that I’d recommend eating an entire pie in one serving… lol
