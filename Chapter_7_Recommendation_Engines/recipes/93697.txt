Ingredients:
4 pounds boneless pork roast
Salt and ground black pepper
Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil or Filippo Berio Olive Oil
4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary
1/2 cup hot water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
On a work surface, open the roast with the boned side facing up. Cut a slit the length of the roast. Season generously with salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Spread about two-thirds of the garlic and rosemary evenly over the surface. Roll the pork and tie at intervals with kitchen string. With a thin knife, make about 8 slits in the outside of the roast. Insert some garlic and rosemary into each slit. Season the outside with salt and drizzle with olive oil.
Place the roast on a roasting rack set in a roasting pan. Roast for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until an instant-reading thermometer registers 155 degrees F when inserted into the center. Remove from the oven and allow the roast to sit for at least 10 minutes, or until temperature rises to 160 degrees F.
Pour off any fat in the roasting pan. Add the hot water to the pan. Scrape the bottom of the pan to remove any browned particles. Pour into a glass measuring cup. Microwave for 1 minute. Season with salt to taste.
Cut the pork into thin slices. Place on dinner plates. Drizzle with the reserved pan juices. Spoon the spinach on the side.
