Ingredients:
12 Hard boiled eggs (large or xtra large eggs)
3 Heaping Tablespoons Real or Lite Mayonaise
2 t. Yellow Mustard (prepared mustard)
1/4 C. Sweet Pickle Relish (prepared relish)
1/2 t. black pepper
1/4 t. sea, kosher or table salt
Dried Dillweed and Paprika for garnish

Directions:
Cool down hard boiled eggs in ice water until chilled. Remove shell from hard boiled eggs. Halve eggs lengthwise, putting yolks into a medium bowl. Place egg whites (should have a nice "well" for the deviled yolk mixture) on a plate or a deviled egg dish if you have one.
Mash and stir yolks with a fork until the consistancy of coarse meal. Add salt and pepper, stir to blend. Mix in mayonaise, mustard and relish, blend well to make the mixture workable.  Use fork to gather up enough yolk mixture to fill egg white "cups".  You may also place mixture into a pastry bag or frosting press to make them cute and swirly. Mixture should "heap" up over edge of egg white "cup".  Sprinkle each deviled egg with a dash of dill and paprika for festive color.

Description: 
I watched my mother prepare deviled eggs all during my childhood up through adulthood. She was a fabulous cook and very seldom measured a thing! I have made this recipe hundreds of times and I get requests to bring them to parties, especially cookouts.  Enjoy!
