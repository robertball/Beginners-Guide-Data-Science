Ingredients:
1 Granny Smith Apple - peeled, cored, and diced in large pieces (skin can be left on)
1 medium-sized cooking pumpkin
1 large white onion, sliced
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 clove garlic, sliced
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1 cup (250 mL) white wine
1 1/2 (375 mL) cups cream
1 teaspoon (5 mL) cinnamon
Pinch nutmeg (fresh, if available)

Directions:
1. Peel and remove the seeds from the pumpkin. Cut into 1 inch pieces. Coat with oil, salt, and pepper. Roast the pumpkin in a 375 degrees Fahrenheit oven (190 degrees Celsius) until tender. Remove from heat and reserve for later.
2. In a medium pot, heat 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of oil and saute onion, celery and garlic until tender. Add the apple, pumpkin, thyme, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Let cook for 2 minutes.
3. Add the wine to the mixture and reduce by half. Add the cream and bring to a boil. If there is not enough liquid in the pot, make sure the vegetables are covered by adding water.
4. When the mixture is well incorporated and all the vegetables are soft, place in blender and puree until smooth.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
I found this recipe years ago in my local newspaper, the Peterborough Examiner. It was printed in the October 15, 2003 edition on page C3. When I made it, I used water instead of white wine and found the result fairly bland. I didn't copy down any information about preparation time or amount of servings so I am just guessing about those.
