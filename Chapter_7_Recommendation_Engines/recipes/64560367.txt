Ingredients:
4 thin sliced chicken breasts
1/2 cup flour white or whole wheat
1/2 can of Cream of Mushroom Soup by Campbell's
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black ground pepper
1 tbsp ground garlic
2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
To slice your chicken breasts, grab one chicken breast at a time and place it horizontally in front of you.  With a knife create thin slices (less than 1/4 inch each).  Each breast should produce 12-14 thing slices.
Put all thin sliced meat in a bowl.
Pour 1/2 cup over the meat and with your hands slowly work the flour evenly over all slices of the chicken.
Now add your salt, pepper and garlic to the meat and continue working everything into the meat.
Grab any saute type skillet/pan turn it on to a medium high (7 on my oven) and add olive oil - allow to preheat.
Once  your pan is preheated put all contents from the bowl and allow to cook.
To speed the cooking process, after putting the chicken breast into the pan I grab a fork and separate all pieces so they are evenly cooking on each side.
Cook each side 4 minutes and turn over for another 4 minutes.
After 8 minutes of cooking, now add your 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.
Cook additional 2/3 minutes, turning the meat and soup to distribute and coat evenly.
Once sauce is coated. Remove from heat and serve over your favorite side.
