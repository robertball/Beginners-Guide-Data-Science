Ingredients:
10 medium baking potatoes
2 cups oil for frying, or as needed
1/4 cup margarine
salt to taste
1 pound ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix
1 pound processed cheese food, cubed
chili powder to taste

Directions:
In a microwave, cook potatoes on high heat until soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn and rearrange potatoes for even cooking every few minutes.
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut potatoes in half lengthwise, and scoop out center of potatoes, leaving about 1/4 inch on the skins. Place scooped out potato in a medium bowl, and mash together with margarine and salt. Set aside.
Fry skins in the hot oil, turning occasionally until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place ground beef in a large skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown; drain. Mix in chili seasoning and processed cheese. Cook and stir until cheese is melted.
Stuff potato skins with the ground beef mixture, and top with mashed potato mixture. Sprinkle the tops with chili powder. Arrange stuffed skins in a single layer on a large baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until mashed potatoes are lightly browned.
