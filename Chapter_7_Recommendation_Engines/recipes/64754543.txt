Ingredients:
2 & 1/2 cups Black beans, blended
2 cups whole rolled oats, ground, more as needed (or oat flour)
2 cups raw, shelled sunflower seeds, ground
1 red bell pepper, finely minced/processed
1 green bell pepper, finely minced/processed
1 white onion, finely minced/processed
16oz. White Mushrooms, finely minced/processed
3 Tbsp parsley
2 Tbsp salt, more to taste
2 Tbsp pepper
2 Tbsp onion powder
2 Tbsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp cumin
2 Tbsp vegan worchestershire sauce
Toppings of choice (i.e. lettuce, pickles, tomato, raw/grilled onion, grilled mushrooms, avocado, jalepeños, bell peppers, ketchup, mustard, bbq sauce, etc)
1/2 cup canola/vegetable/peanut oil to use for pan frying
Wax paper/parchment

Directions:
Make the black beans according to the package
instructions (easier if done the day before),or use
cans of black beans, reserve the water, rinse.
Process/blend the beans with some of the water
from the pot (just enough to get the processer/blender going) or the reserved water
from the cans.
Blend/process the whole oats until it becomes oat
flour (or use oat flour). Place in a large bowl.
Blend/process the sunflower seeds until finely
ground. Add to the large bowl.
Cut the bell peppers in half and remove the seeds.
Cut into 1" pieces (just to make it easier on the
processer/blender).
Cut the onion into 1" pieces.
Remove the mushroom stems, then quarter the
mushrooms.
Process/blend the vegetables, together but in
batches, so it is easier on the processer/blender.
Add to the large bowl with the sunflower seeds and
oat flour.
Add the seasonings and worchestershire to the
bowl. Mix thoroughly (using your hands is easier, but
you can use a rubber spatula), until it is very
dense. Add more oat flour, if needed (to make
sure it will hold it's shape).
Roll into tight balls, flatten, and cup the sides to
ensure the patty does not have any cracks.
Place onto wax paper/parchment.
Heat the oil in a skillet to about 350°F, or on MED
heat. Remove from the wax paper/parchment and
carefully place in the oil, using your hands if
skilled, or a spatula. Cook until browned and
crispy (about 3-5 mins) on each side.
Remove from the oil and place onto a paper towel
lined plate for about 2 mins, to drain the excess
oil. Repeat until all burgers are cooked.
Place on a bun and add condiments and
toppings. Serve.
***Side notes: Be sure to wash and dry all produce thoroughly before handling.
Leftover burgers can be panfried in about 2 Tbsp oil to reheat.
This is a large batch. If your family is small, then make a half batch, or you can use half of the batch for burgers, and the other half for "meat"balls. For cooking instructions, see my vegan meatball recipe.
