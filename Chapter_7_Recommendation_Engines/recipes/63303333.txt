Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter, room temperature
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
1 large head cauliflower

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a small bowl, combine butter, dil, lemon zest, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper.
3. Trim all the leaves off the cauliflower, and cut the stem flush with the bottom of the head so it will sit steadily.
4. Spread the butter mixture evenly over the top and sides of the cauliflower. Place it in an casserole just large enough to hold it, and cover with foil.
5.Bake until fork-tender around 1 1/4 hours.
6. Place on a platter and spoon remaining juices over the top.
