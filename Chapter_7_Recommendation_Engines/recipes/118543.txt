Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless turkey breast, halved
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup apple juice
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cold water
1/4 teaspoon browning sauce (optional)

Directions:
Place the turkey skin side up in a 5-qt. slow cooker. Combine the cranberry sauce, sugar, apple juice, vinegar, garlic, mustard, cinnamon, cloves and allspice; pour over turkey. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F.
Remove turkey to a cutting board; keep warm. Strain cooking juices. In a saucepan, combine flour and water until smooth; gradually stir in strained juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in browning sauce if desired. Serve with sliced turkey.
