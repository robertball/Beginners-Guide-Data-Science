Ingredients:
2 cups flour
4 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
4 tsp. white sugar
1/4 cup margarine
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
1 cup milk
2 cups brown sugar
2 Tbsp. margarine
3 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, salt, white sugar, margarine, milk.
It should form a really thick dough. Spread the dough out in a greased 9 x 13 pan.
Bring brown sugar, margarine and water to a boil. Pour over dough.
Cook at 350 F for 30-40 minutes.
Make sure the dough part is golden brown and looks like it's floating in the sauce before you pull it out of the over. Ice cream is a must for this recipe! :)
