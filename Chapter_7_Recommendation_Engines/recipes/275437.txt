Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1 (9 ounce) package ground chorizo sausage
½ cup chopped yellow onion
1 tablespoon butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup ketchup
¾ cup beef broth
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 ½ teaspoons chipotle chile powder
½ teaspoon dry mustard powder
½ teaspoon hot sauce (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon beef broth, or more as needed (optional)
6  pretzel rolls, split and toasted

Directions:
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground chicken and chorizo sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Return meat to the skillet; add onion and butter. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; saute for 30 seconds.
Stir ketchup, broth, brown sugar, chile powder, mustard powder, hot sauce, salt, and pepper into the skillet until well combined; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 15 to 20 minutes. Add broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, if mixture looks dry. Serve on toasted pretzel rolls.

Description: 
The all-American Sloppy Joe heads South of the border in this blended fusion. I chose to top mine with Mexican crema (sour cream) and slices of avocado.
