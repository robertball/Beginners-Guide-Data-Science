Ingredients:
30 fresh okra, cut into 1-inch pieces, or more to taste
6 cherry tomatoes, quartered, or more as desired
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
kosher salt to taste
4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine okra and tomatoes in a bowl. Drizzle enough olive oil over okra mixture to coat; toss and season with salt. Mix bacon and garlic into okra mixture and transfer to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until okra is tender, about 40 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over okra mixture and bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.
