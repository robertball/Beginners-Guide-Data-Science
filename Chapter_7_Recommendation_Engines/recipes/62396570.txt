Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 egg
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/4 cup butter
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder
1/2 cup boiling water

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat the egg together with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Set aside.
In a shallow bowl or dish mix together the flour, garlic powder and paprika. Dip the chicken in the egg/lemon mixture, then in the seasoned flour.
In a large skillet, melt butter/margarine and brown the coated chicken pieces.
Dissolve the bouillon in the boiling water, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Pour liquid into skillet. Cover and let simmer for 20 minutes, turning chicken pieces after 10 minutes, until chicken is tender. Garnish as desired and serve.
mixture. I browned the chicken in butter and olive oil until done and placed them on a cookie sheet in the oven (250 degrees to keep warm) when they were done. While they were in the oven, I made the sauce. I doubled the recipe, brought it all to a boil (I added a little sugar, 1 tsp... helps cut the sour of the lemon), then added a little bit of cornstarch mixed with water to help thicken it. I added the chicken right before serving... just long enough to coat it. That way the breading didn't get soggy. Everyone raved...
