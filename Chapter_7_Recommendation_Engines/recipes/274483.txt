Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 (12.4 ounce) cans refrigerated cinnamon rolls with icing (such as PillsburyÂ® Refrigerated Cinnamon Rolls with Icing)
6 eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour melted butter into a 9x13-inch heat-resistant glass container (such as Pyrex(R)). Cut each cinnamon roll into 8 pieces and spread in the dish.
Beat eggs using a whisk in a large bowl. Beat in heavy cream, cinnamon, and vanilla extract until combined. Pour over cinnamon rolls. Sprinkle with pecans and maple syrup.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, microwave cinnamon roll icing according to package instructions until soft, about 15 seconds. Pour over cooled casserole.
