Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 fresh red chile pepper, seeded and chopped
or 3/4 t crushed red pepper
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cup chicken broth
1 pinch paprika
1 cup white wine
1 (10 ounce) can minced clams, drained with juice reserved
25 mussels, cleaned and debearded
25 shrimp
10 ounces scallops
1 pound cod fillets, cubed

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and saute the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and chile pepper until tender.
Add parsley, salt and pepper, basil, oregano, thyme, tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, paprika, and juice from the clams.
Stir well, reduce heat, and simmer 1 to 2 hours, adding wine a little at a time.
About 10 minutes before serving, add clams, mussels, prawns, scallops, and cod.
Turn the heat up slightly and stir.
When the seafood is cooked through (the mussels will have opened, the prawns turned pink, and the cod will be flaky), serve your delicious cioppino in individual bread bowls or over linguine.
