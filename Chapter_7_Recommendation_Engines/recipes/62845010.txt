Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup butter (about 5 tablespoons)
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup milk
4 black plums, pitted and thinly sliced
3/4 cup blueberries

Directions:
1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line bottom of 9 inch springform pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Spray with cooking oil spray.
2. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a small to medium sized bowl. Set aside.  In a large bowl, cream together the 1/3 cup butter and 1 cup white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and add the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated.
3.Pour batter into the prepared pan. Arrange and distribute the plums and blueberries around the edges and top of the batter, overlapping slightly. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in the microwave and add brown sugar; carefully pour over fruit.  Bake in the preheated oven for 40-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool 15 minutes before serving.
