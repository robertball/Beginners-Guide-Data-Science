Ingredients:
2	tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
½	pound chorizo or andouille sausage, thinly sliced
5	red or white boiling potatoes, cut in half, then thinly sliced into half moons
1	large onion, chopped
1	carrot, peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and sliced into half moons
4	garlic cloves, minced
Salt and black pepper
1	cup dry white wine (optional)
1	14 ounce can diced tomatoes
1	quart chicken stock
2	jarred roasted red peppers or 2/3 cup fresh chopped tomatoes, chopped
1 ½	pounds fresh cod, or Halibut cut into 2 inch chunks
½	cup fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped

Directions:
1.	Preheat a soup pot over medium high heat with the olive oil.  Add the sliced chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes.  Add the potatoes and continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Add the onions, carrots, and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.  Add the white wine and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the canned tomatoes, chicken stock, and roasted red peppers bring up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.  You want the soup to be at a gentle simmer before you add the fish so, if necessary, turn the heat down a little. Add the fresh tomatoes if using now,  add the cod.  Gently simmer for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.  Finish the soup with the parsley, taste for seasoning, and serve.
