Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 carrots, chopped
1 small head broccoli, chopped
1 cube vegetable bouillon (such as Telma®)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 (6 ounce) package seasoned chicken-style vegetarian strips (such as Lightlife Smart Strips®), chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust into a pie pan.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and carrots; boil until tender, about 15 minutes. Add broccoli and cook for another 3 minutes.
Bring 1 cup water to a boil and stir in bouillon cube to dissolve. Stir in flour; remove from heat.
Combine potatoes, carrots, broccoli, bouillon stock, and vegetarian strips. Pour into the pie crust. Top with the second pie crust and crimp edges to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
