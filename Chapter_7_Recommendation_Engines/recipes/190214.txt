Description: 
The beer -- I like to use Molson Canadian, but any brand will do -- is the key to this simple but delicious slow cooker recipe. Add your favorite spices to give it a different flavor. This recipe is very flexible! And best of all, the leftovers can be used for pulled pork, stew, or sandwiches.
