https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons dry milk powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, sugar, dry milk, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
Combine egg, oil and vanilla extract in a small bowl; mix well. Add to flour mixture and stir until no longer dry but still slightly crumbly. Stir in chocolate chips.
Roll dough into a large ball or tube; form into 1- to 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange on cookie sheets and flatten if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool on the cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I have been intrigued by the cake mix cookie recipes published on Allrecipes and discussed in the Recipe Exchange. Between that, and the recurring requests in the Exchange for cookies that don't go flat, and people either unwilling or unable to use boxed cake mix, I was inspired to come up with this recipe. The basic recipe is for chocolate chip cookies. It is easily adaptable and can be customized to your liking.
