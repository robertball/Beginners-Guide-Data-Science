Ingredients:
1 (17.1 oz) package natural cake mix
1  (11.3 oz) package chocolate frosting
3 oz. chopped semi-sweet chocolate
1 tablespoon natural shortening

Directions:
Prepare the cake mix according to package directions using any of the recommended pan sizes. When cake is done, crumble while warm into a large bowl, and stir in the frosting until well blended.
Melt chocolate with shortening in a glass bowl in the microwave, or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally until smooth.
Use a melon baller or small scoop to form balls of the chocolate cake mixture. Dip the balls in chocolate using a toothpick or fork to hold them. Place on waxed paper to set.

Description: 
Still very versatile and heavily addictive, this recipe was made healthier by using organic cake mix, and bittersweet chocolate and shortening instead of chocolate flavored confectioners coating.Modified from: Cake Balls
