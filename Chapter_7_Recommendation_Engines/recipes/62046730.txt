Description: 
This recipe was handed down from my mother-in-law.  It is a must at every holiday meal.  Make sure you make it a day ahead of time so all the flavors blend together to create an outstanding fruit salad.  If you need to cut back on calories use cool whip instead of whipping cream, but it won't taste quite as good.
