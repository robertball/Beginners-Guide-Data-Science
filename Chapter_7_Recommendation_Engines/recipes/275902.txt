Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach leaves
1 (10 ounce) jar artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
32 ounces cauliflower rice
2 cups cooked quinoa
2 eggs
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as Daiya®)
2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as Daiya®), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the hot oil for 1 minute. Add spinach and cook until wilted, 5 to 7 minutes. Add artichokes and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Cook cauliflower rice in the same skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add to the spinach mixture with cooked quinoa; mix well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, until thoroughly incorporated. Stir in 1/4 cup vegan cheese. Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons vegan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil casserole in the preheated oven until cheese is gooey and golden brown, about 2 minutes.
