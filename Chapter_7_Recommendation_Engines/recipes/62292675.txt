Ingredients:
3/4C peanut butter
1/4C softened butter
1/3C white sugar
1/3C lightly packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/4C whole wheat flour
3/4 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F
Beat the peanut butter, butter and both sugars in a large bowl, with an electric mixer for 2 minutes at high speed, scraping the edges when needed.
Add your egg and vanilla. Beat for about 10 seconds or until just incorporated.
In a separate smaller bowl, sift your flour, baking powder and soda.
Add to your wet mixture and stir just until combined.
Drop by rounded teaspoon on to a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, then flatten with a floured fork.
Bake in a preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until just starting to brown at the edges.
Cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container.
