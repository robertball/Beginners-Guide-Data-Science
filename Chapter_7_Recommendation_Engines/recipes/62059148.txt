Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
1 T. green pickle relish
1-2 T. dill weed

Directions:
Mix together the mayonnaise and relish.  There should be very little relish showing once it's mixed.
I don't really measure the dill weed, but keep shaking it on until I can see flecks of dill throughout and I can taste it.
