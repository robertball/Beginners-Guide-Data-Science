Ingredients:
3 eggplant, peeled and thinly sliced
1 whole egg, plus 3 egg whites
2 cups whole wheat bread crumbs
6 cups spaghetti sauce, divided
3/4 pound part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a shallow bowl, beat together egg, egg whites and water. Dip eggplant slices in egg, then in bread crumbs.  Place in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes on each side.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish spread spaghetti sauce to cover the bottom.  Place a layer of eggplant slices in the sauce.  Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with the cheeses.  Sprinkle basil on top.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
I like this recipe because it is not fried and very tasty. I like to make it healthier by using whole wheat breadcrumbs and reducing the amount of fat. Also, by using mostly egg-whites instead of whole eggs I am able to reduce the cholesterol level.Modified from: Eggplant Parmesan II
