Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
1 tablespoon bacon drippings
1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1/4 cup water
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
1 eggplant, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
1 teaspoon Italian herb blend
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 cups fresh spinach leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, or to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble and set aside. Leave 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in the skillet.
Place halved and seeded spaghetti squash cut sides down in a large glass baking dish with 1/4 cup water. Microwave on high until squash is steaming and tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a fork, scrape spaghetti squash strands from skin. Set aside in a large serving dish and keep warm.
Cook and stir onion and eggplant in remaining bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium heat until the onion turns translucent and eggplant is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and Italian herb blend. Add coconut milk, bring to a simmer, and cook until warmed through, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and use an immersion blender to puree the eggplant-coconut mixture until smooth.
Return blended coconut milk sauce to skillet over medium-high heat and stir in crumbled bacon and spinach. Simmer, stirring often, until spinach is wilted and sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over spaghetti squash and sprinkle with nutritional yeast to taste.
