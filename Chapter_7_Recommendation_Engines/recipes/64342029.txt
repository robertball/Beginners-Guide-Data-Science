Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 pounds leeks, white and light green parts only, sliced (see Tip)
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced
3 cups nonfat or low-fat milk
2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, or to taste
Thinly sliced fresh chives for garnish

Directions:
1.To prepare bisque: Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add leeks and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender but not brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Adjust heat as necessary and add a bit of water if needed to prevent sticking. Set aside 1/3 cup of the leeks in a small bowl.
2.Add potatoes, milk and broth to the pot. Bring to a simmer (do not boil) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
4.When the potatoes are tender, remove from the heat. Puree the soup with an immersion blender or in batches in a regular blender. (Use caution when pureeing hot liquids.) Season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, lemon juice and white pepper. Garnish with chives, if desired.

Description: 
It’s hard to believe how rich and creamy this potato-leek soup is even though there’s not a drop of cream in it. Croutons topped with anchovy, olives and leek are a crunchy, savory foil to the soup. But skip them if you like and incorporate all the cooked leeks into the soup instead.
