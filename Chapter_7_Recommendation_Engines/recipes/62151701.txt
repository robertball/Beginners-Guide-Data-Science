Ingredients:
3 Tbl Sherry or balsamic vinegar
3 Tbl Olive oil
1/2 tsp minced garlic
1 Cup french green (puy)lentils
2 Cups chicken or vegetable stock
1 Tbl olive oil
1/3 C snipped fresh chives
1/4 C chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 C diced goat or feta cheese

Directions:
Shake vinigarette ingredients in a jar until blended.  Set aside.
Cook lentils according to directions (about 25 minutes, until tender).  It is very important that you don't overcook.  Let cool for at least 30 minutes. Mix in remaining ingredients with lentils.  Fold in vinaigrette.  This can be prepared the day before. If you prepare ahead, I would recommend adding the cheese and tomatoes (if desired)just before serving.

Description: 
Great side dish. French lentils (also called puy lentils) have a wonderful earthy flavor, you can't substitute regular green/brown lentils.  They are expensive but usually affordable at your local food co-op.  Goat cheese has a creamier texture than feta.  I like to add grape tomatoes.
