Ingredients:
3 oz  paraffin
1 1/2 lb  chocolate almond bark or semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 pkg  large, thin tortilla shells (like burrito shells)
bananas
Sugar Frosted Flakes
RECIPE OF  PEANUT BUTTER FLUFF, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS:
1 1/2 c  packed brown sugar
1 c  water
1/4 c  maple syrup
1 jar(s)  marshmallow cream
1 jar(s)  (small) peanut butter or 2 cups
(Directions to follow)

Directions:
MAKE THE FLUFF: In a saucepan, stir together brown sugar, water & syrup. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to simmer. In large bowl, spoon in marshmallow cream & peanut butter. Pour hot sugar mixture over it. With mixer on low, blend together. While still warm ladle in pint canning jars. Store in fridge.
Lay out one of the tortillas & spread a thin layer on shell; not too thin, leaving about 1/4" all the way around shell free from spread.
Sprinkle enough whole, Frosted Flakes on top of the Fluff to cover but don't over do it.
Peel banana & lay a whole banana toward one long side of prepared tortilla. Will probably take 1 1/2 bananas for each tortilla. Tightly roll around the banana.
Using a sharp serrated knife, slice into about 1/2" slices & place on waxed paper, laying flat.
In a small, deep microwave bowl, melt the chocolate & paraffin together, Start with 1 minute & stir & then keep heating & stirring every 30 seconds until it is all melted.
Using your hand, pick up the rolls, one at a time & dip the first 2/3 of roll into chocolate mixture & place on waxed paper, chocolate side down. Repeat until all are coated on the first side. Place the waxed paper on a small tray & place in fridge for 5 minutes to set up. Make sure your chocolate is still warm. Set aside. In another small deep bowl, coarsly crush enough Sugar Frosted Flakes fo dipping the tops of rolls in.
Take rolls out of fridge &, one at a time, dip the other 1/3 in the chocolate & then immediately in the crushed flakes. Place back on waxed paper, flake side up. Repeat until all are coated. Place in fridge until ready to serve.

Description: 
So...I had made a batch of Peanut Butter Fluff & was wondering what I could use it on besides ice cream. Then I got to thinking; Peanut Butter & bananas! Elvis' favorite sandwich. So, I developed this recipe, & in honor of the King, I'm calling it Hound Dog Bites!
