Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
3/4 cup all-purpose flour

1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter until lightly browned. Add oats, stirring constantly until golden, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from the heat; cool. Combine flour and baking soda; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat brown sugar, eggs and vanilla until light. Stir in dry ingredients and peanuts until well blended. Let stand for 15 minutes. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes or until golden. Remove to wire rack to cool.

Description: 
These down-home-flavored cookies are a family favorite. Toasting the oats gives them an extra nutty flavor. The cookies freeze well and remain crisp...but I've found that whenever I make them of our children and grandchildren, I never have enough left to freeze!
