Ingredients:
1/2 head cauliflower, cut into chunks
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place cauliflower chunks in a food processor in batches and process into rice-sized pieces.
Melt butter in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms until softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Warm olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat and saute onion until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add cauliflower 'rice', garlic salt, and pepper; saute for about 8 minutes. Add sauteed mushrooms and Parmesan cheese; stir until mushrooms and cheese are warmed through. Serve warm.

Description: 
Great way to substitute a veggie in place of a rice side. The sauteed mushrooms and Parmesan really give the slightly firm cauliflower the punch of flavor it needs. Inspired by Dr. Mark Hyman's cauliflower rice recipe, but I put my own spin on it.
