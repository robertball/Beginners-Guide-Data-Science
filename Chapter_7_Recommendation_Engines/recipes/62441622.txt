Ingredients:
8 cups rolled oats (4 cups small and 4 cups large oats)
1 ½ cups canola oil
1 ½ cups honey
1 cup wheat germ
1 cup wheat bran
Optional: 1 cup sunflower seeds, 1 cup diced almonds, 1 cup coconut flakes

Directions:
Put ingredients together and cover with oil. Mix granola until it’s all covered with oil (or it will burn). Add honey and cook at 350.
Cook in a roaster for 12 minutes (then turn), cook for another 12 minutes (then turn), then cook for a final 10 minutes (and turn again). The longer you cook the granola, the less chewy it is.
