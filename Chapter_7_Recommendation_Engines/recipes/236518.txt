Ingredients:
6 eggs
1/3 cup light mayonnaise
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 dash hot pepper sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or as desired
1 pinch paprika, or as desired

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Parmesan cheese, oregano, and pepper sauce; season with salt and pepper.
Arrange egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag, and pipe filling into egg white halves. Sprinkle deviled eggs with Cheddar cheese and paprika.

Description: 
I've always marveled at how deviled egg recipes can be fiddled with and ingredients switched in and out, but they always still taste so good! I made this version last night for my fiance, and he loved the blend of sweetness and spiciness! These have oregano, Parmesan-Romano cheese, Dijon mustard, and a dash of hot sauce. I garnished them with a shredded Cheddar cheese blend and some paprika.
