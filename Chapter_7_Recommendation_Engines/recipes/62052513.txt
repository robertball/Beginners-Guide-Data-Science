Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 cup parsley, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup Italian style bread crumbs, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 20 chunks of mozzarella cheese (about the size of a nickel), cooking spray, salt & pepper to taste.

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix (with hands is best.)  The mixing will almost look like a kneading process.  When ingredients have been thoroughly mixed, roll meat mixure into balls about the size of a golf ball.  Gently press a chunk of the mozzarella cheese to the center of the meatball and roll again, so that the cheese is hidden.
Place meatballs in a large frying pan coated with pam cooking spray.  Fry until just browned on all sides (slightly pink is ok but be sure not to overcook).  Repeat process until all meatballs have been browned.  Set aside.
Add meatballs to a large pot filled with tomato sauce and simmer about 1 hour 10 minutes or until your liking.  Serve warm.
