Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup strawberry jam
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Beat butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Add confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, to creamed butter with the mixer on low speed until smooth and creamy; beat in strawberry jam and vanilla extract.

Description: 
This foolproof frosting keeps it simple. While very sweet, it's just the thing to balance the natural flavor of a homestyle scratch cake recipe. I used it the first time to lighten up a cake made with a heavy whole grain white flour. Uh-mazing!
