Ingredients:
Burger Mixture:
1 pound lean (at least 80%) ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup Original BisquickÂ® mix

Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 12 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray.
In 10-inch skillet, cook beef and onion over medium-high heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently, until thoroughly cooked; drain. Cool 5 minutes; stir in Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and cheese.
In medium bowl, stir baking mixture ingredients with whisk or fork until blended. Spoon 1 scant tablespoon baking mixture into each muffin cup. Top with about 1/4 cup burger mixture. Spoon 1 tablespoon baking mixture onto burger mixture in each muffin cup.
