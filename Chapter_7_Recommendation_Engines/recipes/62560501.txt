Ingredients:
1 Pound store bought wheat pizza dough
2 cups cubed, slightly cooked butter nut squash-cut into thin slices
4 ounces reduced fat mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup red onion, sliced thin
3 teaspoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, diced
pepper
parmesan cheese (I skip salt and add a sprinkle of cheese instead)
corn meal-to dust baking sheet

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees. Roll out dough- may need a little extra flour to prevent dough from sticking. Place a small amount of corn meal on baking sheet to prevent dough from sticking- plus it gives it a lil crunch. Place dough on baking sheet- brush oil over the entire sheet of dough. Cover dough with cheese, butternut squash, red onion, sprinkle with parmesan cheese & pepper. Add diced garlic. Bake for about 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
