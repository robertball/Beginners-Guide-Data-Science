Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (12 ounce) bag vanilla chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and vanilla extract; mix well.
Whisk flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves together in another bowl. Beat flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is just-combined. Stir vanilla chips into dough. Drop dough by the 1/8-cup full 2-inches apart on a baking sheet.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until golden and soft, 10 to 11 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe when I wanted a ginger cookie and didn't have any molasses. This has a delicate flavor, not as strong as your typical ginger cookie or gingerbread, but the vanilla chips give it a great creamy richness that complements the spice. It makes an excellent Christmas cookie, and 1 cup of walnuts can be added for another layer of flavor.
