Ingredients:
2 (49.5 fluid ounce) cans chicken broth, divided
1 (20 ounce) package cheese tortellini
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package mild Italian sausage
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
1 bunch fresh spinach, chopped

Directions:
Pour 1 can broth into a small saucepan and add tortellini; bring to a boil. Cook tortellini until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir sausage, onion, garlic, and Italian seasoning until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tortellini-broth mixture, remaining can of broth, tomato puree, and spinach to sausage mixture; cover stockpot and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
