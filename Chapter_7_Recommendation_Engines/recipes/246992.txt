Directions:
Bring chicken stock to a gentle boil in a large pot over medium heat. Add snapper slices, rice, cherry tomatoes, and gai lan. Simmer until snapper is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in green onions and pak chi farang; season soup with salt. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes more.
Divide soup among 4 bowls to serve.

Description: 
This is my favorite breakfast. It is easy to prepare, uses up cooked rice from the day before and is light if your stomach cannot handle anything fried in the morning. It is also very good for anyone suffering from a night of drinking. Serve with pickled chile peppers, dry-roasted Thai chile peppers, fish sauce, and fried garlic on the table so guests can season soup to their tastes.
