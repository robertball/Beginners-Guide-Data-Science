Description: 
This recipe for delicious Southern remoulade sauce has been in my family for many decades. A big bowl of this wonderful sauce, made by my grandmother, always graced the table at our big family seafood boils. It is delicious with every kind of fried and boiled seafood, and even jazzes up your plain-jane sandwiches. Once you taste this, you'll want to put it on everything!
