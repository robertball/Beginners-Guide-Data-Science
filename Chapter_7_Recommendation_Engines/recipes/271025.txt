Ingredients:
2 pounds rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
1 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine rutabaga and water in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain rutabaga in a colander and return to Instant Pot(R). Select Saute function. Cook on low until rutabaga starts to sizzle, about 5 minutes. Cancel Saute mode. Season with brown sugar, butter, and pepper. Use an immersion blender to mash rutabaga until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Description: 
Rutabaga was a vegetable that I seldom cooked because it took so long but with the Instant Pot® it's ready in just over 30 minutes.
