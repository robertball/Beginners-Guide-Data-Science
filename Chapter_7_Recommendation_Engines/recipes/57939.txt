Description: 
A simple dish with a distinct flavor that will leave you craving more. Lentils are cooked with Polish sausage and cumin to make a fast and satisfying meal that is ready in under 30 minutes with minimal effort. Use any type of sausage - I have used bratwurst, chorizo and leftover hot links as well.
