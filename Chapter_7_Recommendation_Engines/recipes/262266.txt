Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
3 cups shredded cooked turkey
2 cups salsa, divided
1 (15 ounce) can sweet corn, drained
1 cup water
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
2 cups cooked rice
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
3 cups crushed tortilla chips

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, cumin, salt, and pepper. Saute until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add black beans, shredded turkey, 1 cup salsa, corn, water, and taco seasoning. Mix well. Cover and simmer until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix remaining 1 cup salsa with cooked rice and spread evenly into the bottom of an ungreased 10x15-inch baking pan. Pour turkey mixture over rice. Layer 1 cup Cheddar cheese over turkey mixture. Top with tortilla chips. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
I made this Mexican turkey casserole for my family the day after Thanksgiving. They gobbled it up. Lol. 
It's a great change of pace from reheating leftovers, for those who love Mexican food.
