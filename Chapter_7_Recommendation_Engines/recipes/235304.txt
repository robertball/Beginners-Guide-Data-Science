Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup crushed pecans, or more to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir brown sugar in hot butter until dissolved. Add cinnamon and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir vanilla into brown sugar mixture; cook and stir until vanilla stops sizzling, about 30 seconds. Add pecans; cook and stir until pecans are fragrant and lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Pour pecan mixture out in a layer on parchment paper. Let cool to room temperature before breaking into pieces, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Super simple and very delicious treat! A brittle that tastes just like the candied pecans from the mall. The recipe doesn't make a big batch but it is definitely worth it. Mexican vanilla is super yummy with this.
