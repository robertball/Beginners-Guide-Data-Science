Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 shallots, sliced
1 pound tart apples, cored and cut into 1/4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1 lime, zested and juiced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or more to taste
2 quarts chicken broth
2 (15 ounce) cans sweet potatoes, drained
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir shallots in the hot oil until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir apples, ginger, zest from 1 lime, red pepper flakes, and cayenne pepper into the pot. Reserve lime juice. Cook and stir mixture until apples are very soft, about 15 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into pot; add sweet potatoes and salt. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir reserved lime juice into soup. Garnish with lime wedges to serve.

Description: 
A creamy fall soup that's easy to make any time of year. The earthiness of the sweet potato is balanced with tart apples, spicy ginger, and touch of zesty lime. If desired, garnish each serving with a dollop of sour cream, some chopped cilantro, and a few sweet, spicy nuts. A Thanksgiving favorite that's a kid favorite year-round. Freezes well!
