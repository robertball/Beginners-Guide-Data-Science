Ingredients:
Mini bisquits
Butter /non stick spray
Alfredo sauce (store bought or homemade)
Pepperoni
Beef pizza toppings
Cubed ham toppings
Cheese

Directions:
Butter or spray a 9x13 baking dish with non stick spray or butter.
Line mini bisquits in rows, making sure they are touching.
Pour Alfredo sauce onto bisquits.
Add pepperoni, beef topping, ham, etc
Turn oven on 400, pre heat
Put dish in oven, I would recommend about 30min since there is alot of sauce, otherwise, it will be soggy.
Cook till the edges of the bisquits are a golden brown or until bisquits are not soggy.
Sprinkle cheese on top, put back in oven until cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
