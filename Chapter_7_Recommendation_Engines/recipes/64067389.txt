Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 egg
3 teaspoons grated lemon peel
1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 to 2 drops green food coloring
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup finely chopped pistachios
60 shelled pistachios (about 1/3 cup)

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat butter, cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until blended. Beat in egg, lemon peel, vanilla and food coloring. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking powder and salt; gradually beat into creamed mixture.
Divide dough in half; shape each into a 7-1/2-in.-long roll. Roll in chopped pistachios. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 2 hours or until firm.
Preheat oven to 375Â°. Unwrap and cut crosswise into 1/4-in. slices. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Press a whole pistachio into the center of each cookie.
Bake 7-9 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Yield: 5 dozen.
