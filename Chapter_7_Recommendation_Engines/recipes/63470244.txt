1 clove garlic minced
1(1lb 14oz) can crushed tomatoes in tomato puree
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
good dash cayenne
3/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a heavy sauce pan, heat oil and saut√© the onion until transparent and just beginning to brown. Add garlic and cook briefly. Stir in tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne. Bring to a simmer, lower heat, and cook for about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir grated Parmesan into sauce. In an oven safe soup bowl, add 1/4 cup of the sauce, then break 1 egg on top and dot each egg with butter.  Sprinkle with parmesan and a dash of paprika for color. Bake, uncovered, for 10 to 20 minutes, just until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still soft.
Serve with warm corn or flour tortillas.
