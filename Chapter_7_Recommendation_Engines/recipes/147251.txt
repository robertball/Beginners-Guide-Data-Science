Pour the whipping cream and Amarula liqueur into a fondue pot; cook and stir over medium-low heat until the mixture boils. Continue to stir while adding the chocolate chips. Reduce heat to low, and stir until the chocolate melts and blends completely with the cream mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Take care not to overheat the mixture.

Description: 
Here's a little twist to a great chocolate dessert fondue using one of South Africa's most exotic liqueurs. I found out about this wonderful liqueur on a trip to Cape Town and knew it would be a great ingredient in many recipes. This dessert fondue is terrific with cookies, strawberries, orange slices, melons, marshmallows, etc. It is extremely easy to make, but your guests will think it you slaved over it.
