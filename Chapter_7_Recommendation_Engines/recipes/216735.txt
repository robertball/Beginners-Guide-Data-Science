Description: 
After trying several brands of store-bought sauce, I decided it was time to make my own.  This sauce is great, and super easy to make, but you should refrigerate it overnight to allow the flavors to meld. I started with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  We all liked the sauce, but I will try it next time with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Refrigerate overnight before using. Makes enough for 4 large pizzas.
