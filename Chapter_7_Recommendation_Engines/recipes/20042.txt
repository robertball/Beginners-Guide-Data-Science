Ingredients:
2/3 cup dry lemonade mix
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
To Marinate: In a nonporous glass dish or bowl combine the lemonade mix, pepper and salad dressing. Mix well. Add chicken and toss to coat; cover and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours to marinate.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove chicken from marinade, discarding any remaining marinade, and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
