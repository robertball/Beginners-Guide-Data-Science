1 all-beef hot dog (Hebrew National please!)
1 poppyseed hot dog bun
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 tablespoon sweet green pickle relish
1 tablespoon chopped or grated onion
4 cherry tomato wedges (two cherrys)
1 dill pickle spear
2 mild bananna peppers - chopped
1 dash of Srirache hot chili sauce
1 dash celery salt

Directions:
Grill hot dog for 5 minutes or until done. Remove hot dog and set aside. Butter the bun before grilling.  Place hot dog in the bun. Pile on the toppings in this order: yellow mustard, Srirache sauce, sweet green pickle relish, onion, tomato wedges, pickle spear, bananna peppers, and celery salt.  The tomatoes should be nestled between the hot dog and the top of the bun.  Place the pickle between the hot dog and the bottom of the bun. Don't even think about ketchup!
