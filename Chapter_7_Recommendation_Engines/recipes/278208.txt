Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 green bell peppers, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 pound chicken andouille sausage, quartered lengthwise and sliced
2 (14.5 ounce) cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon salt-free Cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
1/2 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
5 cups frozen riced cauliflower
2 sprigs chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add flour; cook, stirring constantly, until flour is deep golden and smells toasty, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat if browning too quickly. Transfer to a 6-quart slow cooker.
Add oil, bell peppers, onion, and garlic to the skillet; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir into slow cooker until coated. Stir in sausage, tomatoes, broth, Cajun seasoning, salt, and black pepper.
Cook on Low for 6 to 7 hours or on High for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Stir in shrimp; cook until opaque, about 30 minutes on Low or 15 minutes on High.
Meanwhile, place riced cauliflower in a heatproof dish, cover, and microwave until heated through, about 4 minutes, stirring halfway through.
Serve gumbo over cauliflower. Sprinkle with parsley and additional black pepper.
