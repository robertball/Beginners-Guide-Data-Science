Ingredients:
2 lbs. lean ground beef, browned and drained well.
Any giblets (diced) that have been cooked with the bird add to the richness.
1/2 onion, chopped.
3 or 4 medium sized potatoes, cooked and mashed.
4 slices of bread, partially dried and pulled apart.
salt to taste.
pepper to taste.
poultry seasoning to taste.
Sage to taste.
2 to 3 c. Chicken or turkey broth.

Directions:
Place all the ingredients except broth in a heavy pan on the stovetop.
For the beginning layering of seasonings start out with 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper, 1 tsp of poultry seasoning, and sage is strictly per taste, remembering that the flavor will intensify.
Start out adding enough broth  until you end up with a slightly runny mixture. Thickening will occur as cooked.
Using a hand masher, mash all the ingredients together until the bread is absorbed and no longer visible.
Cook over medium heat until bubbly, then turn down to low heat.
Continue cooking approximately an hour.
When simmering, more broth and seasoning can be added.
This can be transferred to a crockpot to medium or low setting to finish cooking.

Description: 
This is not a recipe for salad dressing! This is the type of holiday stuffing our family was raised to know. It comes from my fathers' French Canadian heritage. It compliments any holiday meal, but is particularly well matched with bird (turkey, goose, pheasant, etc.) It is not meant to be a firm stuffing, it's more of a loose mashed potato consistency.
