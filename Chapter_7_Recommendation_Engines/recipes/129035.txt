Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large onions, cut into medium dice
4 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1 (16 ounce) package cocktail rye bread
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 pounds thin ham slices from a baked spiral-cut ham (or substitute Black Forest ham), cut to fit rye bread
12 ounces thinly sliced Swiss cheese, cut to fit rye bread Arugula or other baby salad greens
Toothpicks (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until well-browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add rosemary and cloves; continue to saute until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Stir in cranberry sauce, and simmer until heated through. Remove from heat and set aside. (Cranberry-Onion Relish can be cooled, covered and refrigerated up to 2 weeks ahead.)
To assemble: Working in batches, lay breads on a work surface and spread with about 1/4 tsp. mustard and 1 tsp. cranberry relish. Top half the breads with a portion of ham, cheese and arugula (optional), then the remaining bread slice. Halve each sandwich on the diagonal, sticking each half with a toothpick. (Sandwiches can be covered with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap and can remain at room temperature for 2 hours.)
