Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pound dates, pitted and chopped
1 pound orange slices candy, chopped
2 cups chopped pecans
1 1/3 cups shredded coconut
1 cup orange juice
2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one 10 inch tube pan.
In a mixing bowl, cream margarine and granulated sugar until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Dissolve baking soda in buttermilk and add to the creamed mixture.
Place flour in a large bowl and add dates, orange slices, and nuts.  Stir to coat each piece.  Add flour mixture and coconut to creamed mixture.  This makes a very stiff dough, so it will be necessary to stir with a wooden spoon.
Pour batter into the tube pan.  Bake for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  As soon as cake comes from oven, combine the orange juice and confectioners sugar and pour over hot cake.  Let stand in pan overnight.
