Ingredients:
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sour cream
1 egg
2 teaspoons grated orange zest, or more to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped salted cashews
1 (6 ounce) package dried cranberries, chopped
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy; add sour cream, egg, orange zest and vanilla extract and beat until well mixed. Stir flour mixture into brown sugar mixture until dough is smooth. Fold cashews and cranberries into dough; drop by rounded teaspoons, 2-inches apart, onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Whisk confectioners' sugar and orange juice together in a bowl until glaze is smooth. Drizzle glaze over cookies.
