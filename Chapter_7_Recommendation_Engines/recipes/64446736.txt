Ingredients:
1 pound of fully cooked chicken sausages (your choice of flavor)
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 large orange or red bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, cut into ¼-inch slices
1½ cups short grain rice
3 cups chicken stock
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
2 small ears fresh corn, husks and silks removed, cut into 1-inch rounds
Cilantro leaves, for serving

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Pierce sausage all over with the tip of a paring knife.
2, In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high. Add sausage and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
3. Add remaining tablespoon of oil to skillet along with onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in rice, then stock; season again with salt and pepper. Return sausage to pan and bring liquid to a boil. Add corn, cover, and bake until rice is tender and has absorbed all liquid, about 25 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. Top with cilantro leaves.
