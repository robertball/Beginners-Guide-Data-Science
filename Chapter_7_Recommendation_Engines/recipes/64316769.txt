Ingredients:
SHREDDED, FLAKED OR SHAVED IN THE AMOUNT YOU NEED FOR YOUR RECIPE

Directions:
Stove Top Method
Place desired amount of coconut flakes in a large skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the flakes are mostly golden brown. If the coconut is sweetened it tends to brown faster so, it will take less time.
Oven Method
Preheat oven to 325°F. Spread coconut flakes on a baking sheet in a thin layer and bake in preheated oven. The flakes will toast very quickly and won't take more than 5-10 minutes. After a few minutes stir the coconut to help ensure even color. Remember, sweetened flakes will take less time because sugar speeds the toasting process.

Description: 
Coconut can add flavor and texture to many desserts such as cupcakes, dessert bars and cookies. Shredded or flaked coconut straight from the bag has a great flavor but, in my opinion, it can be a tad chewy. If you’d like the coconut to have a crisp texture, it is really simple to toast at home. Toasting the coconut will also bring out a richer, nuttier flavor and will add more depth to your favorite dishes and desserts.
