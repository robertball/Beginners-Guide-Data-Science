Ingredients:
6 large eggs
2 Tbsp mayonnaise
1 tsp yellow American mustard
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tsp paprika

Directions:
Place eggs in a pot and fill with cold water until eggs are completely submerged with 2 inches (5 cm) above the eggs.
Bring eggs to boil and let cook for 15 min.
Remove pot from heat and place in sink.
Run cold water over eggs until the hot water is gone and replaced by cold (about 1 min).
Crack and peel eggs in the cold water.
Cut peeled eggs in half lengthwise and place yellow egg yolks in a bowl.
Place white halves in a single layer within an air tight plastic container for the fridge.
Using a fork, mash the egg yolks until they are fine and crumbly.
Add mayonnaise, mustard, salt, pepper and paprika to the yolks.  Mix thoroughly until it's the consistency of a paste.
Teaspoon the yolk paste into the egg white halves, making it heaping.
Sprinkle paprika on top for garnish.
Refrigerate eggs until cold, making sure they are in an air tight container.
Good for approximately 5 days.
