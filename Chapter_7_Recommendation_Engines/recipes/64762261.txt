Ingredients:
Gingerbread:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsps ground ginger
1 1/2 tsps ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup molasses
Cheesecake filling:
2 8-oz packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
Pinch of salt
2 eggs
1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
1 tsp orange zest

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9X13 pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides. Lightly grease parchment.
2. Prepare gingerbread. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice until combined. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Mix in molasses.
4. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in three separate additions, mixing only until just combined after each addition. Dough will be somewhat thick. With floured hands, press 2/3 of the dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Set aside.
5. Prepare filling. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until completely smooth and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla and orange zest. Pour filling evenly over prepared crust, and smooth with a spatula.
6. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 of cookie dough over the filling, and gently press down. Bake in preheated oven until edges are set, and the center of the cheesecake only slightly jiggles, about 35-40 minutes. Cool completely in pan. Once cooled, remove from pan using parchment "handles" and slice into bars.

Description: 
A spicy, molasses-y cookie crust and topping, with a creamy cheesecake filling, makes for a lovely treat! I enjoy the orange-gingerbread flavor combination--but if you're not a fan, just leave the orange zest out.
