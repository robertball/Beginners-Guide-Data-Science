Image:

Ingredients:
12  rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)
1 (5 ounce) package baby romaine lettuce leaves
1  cooked boneless chicken breast half, sliced into thin strips
1  red bell pepper, sliced
Â½ cup Caesar salad dressing

Directions:
Fill a large bowl with room-temperature water. Soak 1 rice wrapper in the water until it bends easily, about 15 seconds.
Lay wrapper flat. In a row across the center, place a small handful of lettuce leaves, a few strips of chicken, and a few slices of red bell pepper, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Cut in half and serve with Caesar dressing for dipping.

Description: 
There are certain magical food products that are just too good to be true. Rice paper, or spring roll skins, is one of them. 
These are very easy to make once you get the hang of how long to soak the paper.
