Ingredients:
60 maraschino cherries with stems
3 tablespoons butter, softened
3 tablespoons corn syrup
2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1 pound chocolate confectioners' coating

Directions:
Drain cherries and set on paper towels to dry.
In a medium bowl, combine butter and corn syrup until smooth.  Stir in confectioners' sugar and knead to form a  dough.  Chill to stiffen if necessary.  Wrap each cherry in about 1 teaspoon of dough.  Chill until firm.
Melt confectioners' coating in a heavy saucepan over low heat.  Dip each cherry in by its stem, and place on waxed paper lined sheets.  Chill until completely set.  Store in an airtight container in a cool place.  Best after 1 or 2 weeks.
