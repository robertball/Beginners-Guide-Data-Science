Description: 
I make this tasty butter during the growing season and freeze it for later use. This allows my family and me to enjoy the flavor of fresh basil all year long. I use it to enhance cooked vegetables, chicken and fish. No one seems to miss the salt that I deliberately leave out.Modified from: Basil Butter
