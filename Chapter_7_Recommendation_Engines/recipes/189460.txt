Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 pound ground turkey
1 cup canned pureed tomatoes
1/4 cup barbeque sauce (such as KC Masterpiece®)
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon brown mustard
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ground turkey to the skillet; cook and stir until the turkey is completely crumbled and browned, another 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir the pureed tomatoes, barbeque sauce, ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and chile-garlic sauce into the turkey mixture. Simmer until completely heated, 7 to 10 minutes more.

Description:
