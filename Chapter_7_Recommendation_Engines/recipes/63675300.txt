Ingredients:
1 lb. ground turkey
1/2 lb. lean pork sausage
1/2 C. panko bread crumbs
1/4 C. grated Parmesan cheese
1 packet Good Seasons Italian Dressing
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
2 whole eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400.  Arrange a metal rack on a large, rimmed cookie sheet.  Spray the entire surface with non-stick cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, combine all of the ingredients.  Using wet hands, roll the meatballs into 16 individual balls and arrange them evenly on the prepared metal rack.  Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate each meatball to the other side and bake for 15 more minutes.  Carefully, place hot meatballs into 2 simmering quarts of your favorite pasta sauce.  Cover and cook an additional 30 minutes.
