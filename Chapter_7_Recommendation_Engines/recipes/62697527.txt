Ingredients:
1 16oz Pace PicanteÂ® sauce; medium flavor
2 cups long grain rice
1/3 cup canola oil
4 minced garlic cloves
2 cups low sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350f.
Process picante sauce until pureed and smooth. Exactly 2 cups.
Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear; shake rice to remove excess water and let drain until dry (hot oil and water do not mix!). DO NOT OMIT THIS STEP OR YOUR RICE WILL NOT BE DRY AND FLUFFY.
Heat oil in a heavy bottomed oven safe 10 inch dutch oven with tight fitting lid over medium high heat. Drop a few rice grains in and if they sizzle it's ready. Add rice and fry stirring until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium , add garlic and stir about 1 1/2 minutes.
Stir in broth, pureed mixture. Increase heat to medium high and bring to a boil. Cover pan and transfer to oven to bake until liquid is absorbed and rice in tender, 30-35 minutes. Stir well after 15 minutes.
