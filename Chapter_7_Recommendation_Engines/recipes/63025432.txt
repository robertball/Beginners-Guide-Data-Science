Ingredients:
1 pound sliced firm white sandwich, French, or Italian bread, including crusts, cut  into 1/2-inch cubes (10 cups lightly packed bread cubes)
Turn into a large bowl. Heat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the foam subsides:
1/4 to 1/2 cup (1/2 to 1 stick) unsalted butter
Add and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes:
2 cups chopped onions
1 cup finely chopped celery
Remove from the heat and stir in:
1/4 to 1/2 cup minced parsley
1 tablespoon minced fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried sage
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon grated or ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Add to the bread cubes and toss until well combined. Stir in, a little at a time, until the stuffing is lightly moist but not packed together:
1/3 to 1 cup chicken stock or broth, or as needed
Adjust the seasonings. If you desire a firm dressing and are baking in a dish, stir in:
(2 large eggs, well beaten)
Dressing baked in a dish can be assembled ahead and go directly from the refrigerator to the oven. To bake dressing, spread it in a layer 2 to 3 inches deep in a large buttered baking dish. Ladle over the top 1/2 cup stock, broth, or milk for every 4 to 5 cups of bread stuffing. For a softer dressing, cover with aluminum foil; for a crispy brown crust, dot the top with butter and bake uncovered. For either, bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 to 45 minutes. When baking the dressing and meat, fish, or poultry at the same time, occasionally baste the dressing with the pan drippings.
Variation with Dried Fruit and Nuts
Add 1/2 to 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans, or 1 1/2 cups cooked, canned, or frozen chestnuts, coarsely chopped, and 1 cup dried fruit (such as raisins, cranberries, cherries, or diced dried plums). Toss the bread with the seasonings and bake as above.
