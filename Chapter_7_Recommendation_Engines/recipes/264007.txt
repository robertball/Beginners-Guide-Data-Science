Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add ramen and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes. Drain, saving 1/2 cup of cooking liquid.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onions until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add drained ramen, mushrooms, kale, and salt. Add some of the cooking liquid, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil and cook until kale has wilted and mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.
