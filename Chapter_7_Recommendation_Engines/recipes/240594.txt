Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 carrot, shredded
4 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons salt
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans with liquid

Directions:
Combine ground beef, onions, and garlic in a large stockpot; cook and stir over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add celery and carrot to beef mixture; cook and stir until celery and carrot are slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chili powder, Italian seasoning, and salt into beef mixture, breaking up tomatoes while stirring. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Stir beans into chili and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes.
