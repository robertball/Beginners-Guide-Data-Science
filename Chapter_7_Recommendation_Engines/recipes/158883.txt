Ingredients:
1 cup jasmine rice
2 cups water
1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
1 dried red chile pepper, broken in half (optional)
1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
4 fresh curry leaves
1 pinch asafoetida powder (optional)
1/4 cup milk
1 cup plain yogurt
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat the ghee in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the broken chile pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the black mustard seeds, and cook until they begin to pop, about 30 seconds more. Remove from the heat, and stir in the turmeric, curry leaves, and asafoetida powder.
Whisk the milk, yogurt, and spice ghee together in a large bowl until smooth.  Fold in the rice until well mixed. Season to taste with salt, then allow to cool to room temperature before serving.

This cooling Indian dish is perfect as an accompaniment to grilled meats. Curry leaves can be found at your local Indian store. If you can't find them, they can be omitted, but they do add a unique flavor and smell.
