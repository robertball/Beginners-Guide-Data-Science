Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Regular Flavor Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage
1 pound bacon cooked well and crumbled.
10 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups Half & Half
2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
6 cups cubed bread
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 medium tomato, seeded and chopped (optional)
1 1/2 cup chopped and sauteed onion
couple sprigs fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 F. In large skillet, cook sausage over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until thoroughly cooked and no longer pink. In large mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, mustard and salt; stir well.
Distribute half the bread evenly in a buttered 9 x 13 x 2 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with half the pepper, half the cheese, half the sausage, half the bacon and half of each optional ingredient. Repeat layering using remaining bread, pepper, cheese, sausage and optional ingredients. Pour egg mixture evenly over casserole.
Bake uncovered for 55-60 minutes, or until eggs are set. Tent with foil if top begins to brown too quickly.
With about 10 minutes to cook put a layer of cheese over the top and sprinkle some fresh parsley
