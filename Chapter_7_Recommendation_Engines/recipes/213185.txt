Ingredients:
1/2 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 shallot, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pound thin spaghetti
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 (3.5 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup red wine
1 1/2 cups pasta sauce
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 pinch salt, or to taste
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Place the shrimp, shallot, 1 clove of garlic, creole seasoning, and 1/4 cup of olive oil in a bowl, and stir to coat the shrimp with the marinade. Set the shrimp aside.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet, and brown the sausages on all sides until they are evenly brown, about 10 minutes. Remove the sausages from the skillet, and cook and stir the red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green bell pepper, and onion in the hot skillet until the vegetables are slightly softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in 2 cloves of  garlic, and cook and stir until the garlic is fragrant, about 5 more minutes.
Slice the sausages, and return them to the skillet. Stir red wine and pasta sauce with the sausages and vegetables, bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, and simmer until the vegetables are soft, the sausage is no longer pink in the middle, and the sauce has reduced to about half its volume, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes and salt.
Heat butter in a skillet; cook and stir the shrimp and marinade mixture until the shrimp are pink and opaque and the shallot becomes translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. To serve, place about 1/2 cup of cooked pasta on a warmed plate, and spoon shrimp over one side of the pasta, and sausage and peppers on the other side.
