Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
8 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
1 (4 ounce) can chopped black olives, drained
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon freeze-dried chives
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix cream cheese, blue cheese, black olives, butter and chives. Form into a ball shape.
On a piece of plastic wrap large enough to wrap the ball, pour the chopped pecans. Roll the ball in the pecans to cover. Wrap with the plastic. Chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
I grew up eating this on special occasions. We ate it with either buttery, round crackers or stuffed in celery sticks. It is very rich tasting. Try different types of nuts for the coating.
