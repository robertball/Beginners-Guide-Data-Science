Ingredients:
Bring to boil:
1 cup butter
1 cup water
2 Tbsp cocoa
Remove from heat; let cool.
In a bowl mix in with cocoa mixture:
2 cups sugar
1 tsp soda
2 cups flour
½ cup buttermilk
½ tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray or grease 40 mini-muffin cups. Spoon batter evenly into muffin cups, about 1 heaping teaspoon in each.
Bake for 13 to 15 minutes or until top is set and toothpick inserted into center comes out slightly moist.
After brownies are out of the oven, wait for centers to fall. This will happen upon cooling. If not then tap the centers with teaspoon, this will make a indent for peanut butter.
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup peanut butter chips
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
Over low heat, warm creamy peanut butter. While brownies are still warm spoon about half teaspoon warm peanut butter into the center of each brownie; top with chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. Cool completely in pan. Remove from pan and serve.
