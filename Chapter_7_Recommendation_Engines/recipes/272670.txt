Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package chicken tenders
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ cup BBQ sauce
4 slices cooked bacon
1  tomato, chopped
1 cup shredded lettuce
½ cup shredded Colby cheese
¼ cup ranch dressing
6  spinach-garlic-pesto tortillas

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season chicken with seasoned salt and pepper. Grill chicken over direct heat until juices run clear, turning once or twice, 8 to 10 minutes. Move to an unheated part of the grill and lather with BBQ sauce; let stand until sauce becomes sticky, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cut into bite-sized cubes.
Divide chicken, bacon, tomato, lettuce, Colby cheese, and ranch among tortillas. Roll up tortillas and grill over direct heat, folded-side down, until cheese melts, about 1 minute per side. Cut wraps in half to serve.
