Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup pastry flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 dash ground black pepper, or to taste
1/4 cup molasses
1/3 cup white sugar
1/8 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup butter
egg

Directions:
Mix all-purpose flour, pastry flour, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and black pepper together in a bowl and set aside.
Combine molasses, sugar, and maple syrup in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir constantly to dissolve and remove from heat when a small foam rises to the surface, about 3 minutes. Continue stirring and allow to cool slightly; add butter and let cool to room temperature. Add egg.
Pour molasses mixture into flour mixture in the bowl and mix until crumbles hold together when pressed. Knead for 2 minutes, focusing on any dry bits. Form into a flat log and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Cut dough log into small sections and allow to warm up slightly before rolling out between 2 layers of parchment paper to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut shapes with a floured cookie cutter or pastry wheel. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 12 minutes; remove cookies before they brown. Cool on a rack.

Description: 
Crunchy, but not hard, spicy gingerbread cookies from Sweden. You can omit the egg to make it more cracker-like. If you prefer a little softer cookie, leave on the tray for a minute or two before moving to the cooling rack.
