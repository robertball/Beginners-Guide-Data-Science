Ingredients:
1 large sweet onion
1 large orange, unpeeled
1 medium sweet red pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 medium yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
8 medium fresh mushrooms
8 cherry tomatoes
2 small yellow summer squash, cut into 1 inch slices
MARINADE:
1/2 cup olive or vegetable oil
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons orange juice

Directions:
Cut the onion and orange into eight wedges; halve each wedge.  Alternately thread vegetables and orange pieces onto eight metal or soaked wooden skewers.  Place in a shallow oblong dish.  In a bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, sugar, salt if desired, garlic powder and pepper.  Pour over skewers.  Marinate for 15 minutes, turning and basting frequently.  Grill, covered, over indirect heat for 10-15 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp-tender.  Brush with orange juice just before serving.
