Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 stalks celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
2 medium sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 (15 ounce) can low-sodium black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (10 ounce) bag plant-based "ground beef" (such as Beyond MeatÂ® Beefy Crumbles)
1/2 (8 ounce) package fresh baby spinach
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a medium stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, and garlic and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, mustard powder, salt, and pepper. Add vegetable broth and sweet potatoes and bring to a boil, uncovered. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 6 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and add black beans, vegan "ground beef," spinach, and nutritional yeast. Cook until spinach has softened and soup is heated through, about 10 minutes.
