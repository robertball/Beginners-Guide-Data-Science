1 teaspoon ground ginger
4 ounces soy sauce
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
½ cup packed brown sugar
⅜ cup bourbon
½ teaspoon garlic powder

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Remove dish from refrigerator and remove cover. Bake in the preheated oven, basting frequently, for 1 1/2 hours or until chicken is well browned and juices run clear.

Description: 
A favorite named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana and for the bourbon whiskey ingredient; although this dish, sold as Cajun-style cuisine in malls all over America, is reported to be nothing of the kind (not genuine Creole or Cajun fare)! Note: If you double the recipe, make sure that the chicken is still in a single layer. Laissez les bons temps rouler!
