Ingredients:
2 cups mascarpone cheese
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup whipped cream
16 large strawberries, washed and dried well
1/4 cup coarse granulated sugar
2 teaspoons lemon zest

Directions:
Beat the mascarpone cheese, confectioners sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.  Fold in the whipped cream.  Spoon cheese mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tip.
Leaving the stem end in tact, cut off the tip of each strawberry, and carefully remove the core using a small, thin knife.  Stand strawberries upright (stem end down), and slice through the tip toward the stem.  Do not cut completely through.  Repeat, slicing a total of 4 times.  Each strawberry will have 8 sections.  Roll the strawberries in the sugar.
Gently open each strawberry and fill each with the cheese mixture, using a circular motion.  Arrange strawberry roses on a platter, and sprinkle with lemon zest.

My husband and I created these delicious strawberries for a Valentine's dinner we hosted several years ago. They've been a favorite of ours for many years.  They are simple to make for any romantic dinner.
