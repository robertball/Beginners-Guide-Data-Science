Ingredients:
1/2 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup flax seed meal
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup sliced almonds
1 cup butterscotch chips
1 1/2 cups brown sugar, divided
3/4 cup cold butter cut into cubes
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 cup fresh raspberries
2 Tbsp cornstarch
2 Tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 9x9 baking dish.  In a large bowl, combine flours, flaxseed, oats, almonds, butterscotch chips and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Mix well.  Using a pastry cutter or food processer, cut in butter until mixture is coarsely crumbled and a little mealy. Press down half the mixture in the pan and set the rest aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the berries, corsnstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest and remaining 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Mix until all the berries are coated and the cornstarch is dissolved. Spread the berry filling evenly across the crust.
Top the filling with the remaining crust and lightly pack down.  Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust on top has formed and is golden brown.
