Description: 
This is an old time family favorite.  The wonderful aroma is very welcoming to guests and family alike.  The secret is to use freshly ground allspice (unlike Bay leaves they lose much of their flavor when previously ground).  Using fresh and upgraded ingredients make a gourmet dish that is truly a comfort food!
