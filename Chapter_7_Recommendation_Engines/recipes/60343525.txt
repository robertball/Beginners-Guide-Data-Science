Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon shortening
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
Melt the chocolate and shortening over medium heat in small saucepan. Stir until smooth and creamy. Spread over crepes and roll. Top with powdered sugar.

Description: 
This recipe is perfect for crepes. My kids are not quite sophisticated enough to understand crepes but they always ask me for these when I make them with chocolate and powdered sugar.Modified from: Basic Crepes
