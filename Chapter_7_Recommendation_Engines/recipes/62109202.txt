Ingredients:
1 bag shredded cabbage
1 can read beans, drained
1 can corn, drained
1/2 medium red onion, chopped
DRESSING
1/2 cup light mayonaise
1 8 ounce bottle mild taco sauce

Directions:
Mix the cabbage, beans, corn, and onion in a bowl.  Stir the mayonaise and taco sauce together and blend the dressing into the slaw. Cover and refrigerate for about 45 minutes. I would not recommend making this the night before. It becomes soggy.

Description: 
Not only is this recipe easy to make, it is tasty too. Feel free to play with the ingredients: add chopped green peppers, shredded carrots or garbonzo beans. I have even added home-make salsa. It is a great side dish for cookouts and picnics.
