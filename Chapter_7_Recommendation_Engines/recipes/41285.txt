Ingredients:
1 (2.5 pound) broiler-fryer chicken, cut up
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
cooking oil for frying
GRAVY:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken in a large flat dish. Pour buttermilk over; refrigerate 1 hour.
Combine flour, salt and pepper in a double-strength paper bag. Drain chicken; toss pieces, one at a time, in flour mixture. Shake off excess; place on waxed paper for 15 minutes.
Heat 1/8 to 1/4 in. of oil in a skillet; fry chicken until browned on all sides. Cover and simmer, turning occasionally, for 40-45 minutes, or until juices run clear.
Uncover and cook 5 minutes longer. Remove chicken and keep warm. Drain all but 1/4 cup drippings; stir in flour until bubbly. Add milk and 1-1/2 cups water; cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook 1 minute more. Add remaining water if needed. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with chicken.
