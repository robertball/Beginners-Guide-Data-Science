Ingredients:
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate*
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups turbinado sugar (or white if you prefer)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup applesauce
1 cup sour cream
4 cups grated zucchini (or you can do 2 cups zucchini and add 2 cups blended carrots, applesauce)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 TBSP cocoa powder
2 cups 1 to 1 Bob's Red Mill Flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (I like Giardelli 60% cocoa chips or mini chips which seem to work best so they don't fall to the bottom of the bread)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans really good!  In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.
In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, oil, applesauce, sour cream, grated zucchini, vanilla and chocolate; beat well. Stir in the cocoa powder, chocolate chips flour baking soda, salt and cinnamon.
Pour batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean.
Be sure to let the loaf cool at least 10 minutes before removing it from the pan.
*NOTE: If you don't have unsweetened chocolate squares, you can substitute with 3 tablespoon of cocoa and 1 tablespoon of butter per square.
