Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and mashed with fork
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
1 small unpeeled red potato, shredded
1/4 cup diced red onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 egg
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup canola oil for frying
1 cup plain yogurt
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh dill

1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Combine chickpeas, 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs, red potato, red onion, garlic, egg, 1 tablespoon olive oil, cilantro, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl.
Form mixture into 2-inch patties. Place 1/4 cup panko crumbs in a shallow bowl. Gently press patties into the crumbs to coat.
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Fry patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Set patties aside.
