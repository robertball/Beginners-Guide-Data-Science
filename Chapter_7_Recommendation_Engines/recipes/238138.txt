Ingredients:
1 Reynolds® Slow Cooker Liner
2 medium onions, sliced into thin wedges
1/2 cup light beer or water
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast, trimmed of fat
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup barbecue sauce
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Line a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker with a Reynolds(R) Slow Cooker Liner.
Combine onions and beer in prepared slow cooker. If necessary, cut meat so it will fit in cooker. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder,  teaspoon cumin, black pepper, and garlic powder. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over all sides of meat; rub in with your fingers. Place meat in cooker.
Cover and cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high.
Transfer meat to a cutting board. Pull meat apart into shreds using two forks. Return meat to the slow cooker. Stir in barbecue sauce, vinegar, honey,  teaspoon cumin, and ginger gently with a rubber spatula. Heat through.
Spoon meat into buns with a slotted spoon. Drizzle with sauce mixture as desired.  Top with Lime Carrot Slaw.
Lime Carrot Slaw: Place a bag of pre-shredded cabbage and carrots into a large bowl. In a screw-top jar, combine olive oil; lime zest; lime juice; jalapeno; honey; salt; and black pepper. Cover and shake to combine. Stir into the cabbage mixture.
