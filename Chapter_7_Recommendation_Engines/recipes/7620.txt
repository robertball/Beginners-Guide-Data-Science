1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 eggs
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt or tube pan. In a medium bowl, combine the diced apples, 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon; set aside. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups white sugar, oil, orange juice, vanilla and eggs. Beat at high speed until smooth. Stir in flour mixture. Fold in chopped walnuts.
Pour 1/3 of the batter into prepared pan.  Sprinkle with 1/2 of the apple mixture. Alternate layers of batter and filling, ending with batter.
