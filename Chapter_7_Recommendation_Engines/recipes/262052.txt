Ingredients:
2 cups warm water
2 cups pre-cooked cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed

Directions:
Combine water, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl. Mix together and let sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Form dough into patties about 5 inches across and 1/2-inch thick.
Coat a griddle with butter. Cook patties, one at a time, over medium-high heat until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
A popular snack in Columbia, Venezuela, Panama and many other Hispanic countries. Serve with toppings such as cheese, salsa, cream cheese, and butter. I choose to melt cheese on mine during the cooking process, which makes them extra yummy!
