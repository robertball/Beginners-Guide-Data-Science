Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups bread flour
1 cup 2% milk
2 eggs
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch Iranian saffron
3/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Place bread flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter, yeast, salt, and saffron in a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.
Program the bread machine for the dough cycle; press "Start." Mix raisins into the dough by hand after the cycle is complete.
Divide dough into 9 pieces. Roll each piece into a log 6 to 7 inches long. Pinch the ends of 3 logs together and form a 3-strand braid. Pinch ends together at the bottom of the braid. Repeat with remaining logs to make 2 more braided loaves.
Transfer loaves to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, placing them several inches apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are a light golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
My friend showed me this recipe. It has such a floral, delicate taste! The only thing I changed from her recipe was using bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. My favorite bread recipe! Best served with unsalted butter and fresh honey.
