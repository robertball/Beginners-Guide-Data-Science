Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
6 slices white bread, cubed

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and flour to make a batter. Mix in the bread cubes using your hands or a sturdy wooden spoon. Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece into a log about 3-inches long.
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a fast boil. Add the dumplings, cover, and simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the dumplings from the water and let drain. Slice and serve while very hot.

Description: 
These hearty bread dumplings will anchor you during a windstorm and sustain you through the deepest winter, especially when dished up with roast pork, red cabbage, and lots of pan gravy. Many thanks to my husband's family for sharing this recipe.
