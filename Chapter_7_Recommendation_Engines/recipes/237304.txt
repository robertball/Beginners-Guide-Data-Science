Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup crunchy peanut butter
1 cup barley malt syrup
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Beat butter, peanut butter, barley malt syrup, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat eggs into creamed butter mixture until smooth.
Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange on baking sheets. Flatten each ball using a fork, making a crisscross pattern.
Bake in the preheated until edges of cookies are browned, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Makes great cookies! Using barley malt sweetener instead of brown sugar yields a light, not-quite-as-sweet cookie.
