Description: 
Our traditional holiday meal is sauerbraten and gravy, butter-sauteed homemade egg noodles, potato balls, sweet and sour red cabbage, and freshly cooked apples. A lot of work, but worth it once a year! This is a quick recipe to enjoy the sauerbraten flavor without waiting 5 days for a beef roast to marinate. And you'll have plenty of gravy to spoon over your buttered egg noodles and potatoes.
