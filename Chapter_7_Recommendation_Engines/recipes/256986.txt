Ingredients:
1 pound peeled crawfish tails
1 1/2 tablespoons Creole seasoning, or to taste
1/2 cup butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 cup water, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
3 small bread loaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss crawfish tails with Creole seasoning in a bowl.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and green bell pepper; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic. Thin mixture with 1 cup water. Stir in crawfish tails; season with black pepper.
Whisk cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl until smooth. Pour into the saucepan, stirring constantly, until crawfish mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.
Cut tops off bread loaves; hollow out center to create a "boat." Place bread loaves on a baking sheet; spoon crawfish mixture into the center.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is warm and lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
It's yummy! My husband and son love it. 

I got the etouffee recipe from a Cajun friend of mine. It's quick and simple. 

I decided to serve in a bread boat to recreate a favorite dish from a local restaurant.

 I serve it with a salad.
