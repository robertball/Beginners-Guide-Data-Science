3 cups white sugar
1 TBSP vanilla extract
4 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 x 13 baking dish
Combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, until thoroughly blended
Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture until blended. Stir in the chocolate morsels. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared baking dish
Bake in preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove, and cool pan on wire rack before cutting.
