Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups ripe Hachiya persimmon pulp
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups brown sugar
4 eggs
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups fresh cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans.
Stir persimmon pulp and baking soda together in a large bowl. Let stand until pulp is thickened, about 5 minutes. Add sugar, eggs, oil, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Blend until smooth. Mix in flour and fold in cranberries. Divide batter between the prepared pans, filling each 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This bread is the epitome of fall with both persimmons and cranberries, and is wonderful with coffee, hot tea, hot cider, or even a hot buttered rum. A moist bread that can be frozen, but chances are it will disappear before it even cools down!
