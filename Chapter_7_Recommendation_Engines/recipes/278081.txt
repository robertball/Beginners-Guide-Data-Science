Ingredients:
aluminum foil
cooking spray
1 pound lean ground pork
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika

Directions:
Set one oven rack to the middle position and another one 6 inches from the broiler. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
Combine ground pork, maple syrup, garlic, parsley, marjoram, salt, pepper, thyme, and paprika in a bowl; mix gently until well combined. Divide mixture into 6 equal portions and form into patties. Place on the prepared baking sheet and press down with the palm of your hand to flatten.
Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack for 8 minutes. Remove from oven and turn on the oven's broiler on low.
Broil sausage patties on the top rack until they are golden brown, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Lightly seasoned with just a touch of sweetness, these breakfast sausages are great addition to your breakfast plate. I make these in bulk for a quick grab-and-go weekday meal. They can be frozen, just thaw overnight in the fridge.
