Ingredients:
2 # red boiling potatoes, cooked till tender
4 c. firmly packed, finely chopped fresh spinach
1 hot green chile, chopped
1/4 c. chopped cilantro
1 tsp. garam masala
1/2 tsp. each: cayenne and black pepper
1 tsp. salt
juice of 1/2 lemon
1 c. dried bread crums
2 T. oil
tamarind or green chtuney

Directions:
Combine all ingredients through lemon in a large bowl.  Mix with your hands, squeezing the ingredients together.  (There will still be small chunks of potato.)
Spread the bread crumbs on a bowl or plate.  Scoop out about 1/2 cup of the spinach-potato mixture and dump  it into the bowl with the bread crumbs.  Roll it into a ball and coat with bread crumbs.  Then press down to flatten to a 3-inch cake.  Continue with remaining mix, placing patties on a platter or dish.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.
Heat oil, cook half of patties till browned, about 4 minutes, then turn and cook 4 minutes more.  Repeat with remaining patties.  Serve with chutney.
