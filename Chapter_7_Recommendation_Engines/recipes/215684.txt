Ingredients:
4 zucchini
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup cottage cheese
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
5 tablespoons bread crumbs, divided
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add zucchini, whole, and cook until almost soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and allow to cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking pan.
Slice cooked zucchini lengthwise, removing the top third. Scoop out the pulp and transfer to a strainer. Pat pulp dry with a paper towel and transfer to a bowl. Add Monterey Jack cheese, cottage cheese, all but 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, butter, sour cream, garlic, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, salt, and black pepper. Mix to combine.
Spoon mixture into zucchini boats and place on the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle tops with remaining Parmesan and bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn on broiler and continue cooking until tops are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more.
