Ingredients:
1 pound spaghetti
1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets
1/2 cup olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 6 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until golden, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in cauliflower, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Drain pasta and transfer to a large serving bowl. Toss pasta with onion-cauliflower mixture; top with Parmesan cheese.
