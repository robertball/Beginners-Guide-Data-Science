Description: 
The store-bought sauerkraut often used this classic deli sandwich can be bland and less than palatable. Our surprising solution is to simmer bagged coleslaw with vinegar and sugar to produce a great-tasting sauerkraut.
Sweet and sour cabbage and a zesty mustard-flavored mayonnaise transform this deli classic into something special. Oven-grilling allows you to cook the sandwiches all at once (without turning them) rather than cooking in batches on stovetop.
