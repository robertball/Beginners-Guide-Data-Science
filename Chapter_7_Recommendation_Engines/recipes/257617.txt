Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 (15 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 cup frozen corn
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, and carrot; cook and stir until onion is translucent and celery and carrot are crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, paprika, and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour chicken broth, water, and quinoa into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir in diced tomatoes with juice, black beans, and corn. Bring back to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until black beans are heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
