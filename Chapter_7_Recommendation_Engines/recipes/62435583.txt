Description: 
The fishermen of Bodega Bay, California shared this favorite, quick and easy recipe with my sister during a Fish Festival.  It is one of the best chowders I've had, and my kids love it too!  We top with bacon bits and a few shakes of hot sauce for a little spice.  Enjoy!Modified from: Fish Chowder
