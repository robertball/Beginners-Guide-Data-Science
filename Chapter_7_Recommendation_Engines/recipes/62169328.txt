Ingredients:
8 cups chicken broth
2 cups shredded, cooked chicken
1/2 pound egg noodles
1/2 pound frozen mixed vegetables
1 cup milk, half and half, or cream
2 Tbs flour
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
In a large saucepan, bring chicken broth to a boil.
Add shredded, cooked chicken and egg noodles.  Return to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are al dente.
Add frozen mixed vegetables.  Return to a boil once more and cook until vegetables are heated through, about 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk milk, half and half, or cream together with the flour, garlic powder, and onion powder.
Lower heat under saucepan to medium low.  Drizzle milk mixture into soup while stirring gently.  Simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
I created this creamy, comforting soup when one of my daughters was sick and wanted chicken noodle soup, but I needed something more substantial to feed the rest of the family.  I made a simple chicken noodle soup, took out a portion for the sick child, and added extras to the remainder.  It was a hit!
