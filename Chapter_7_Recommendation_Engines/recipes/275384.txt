Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package CAULIPOWERÂ® Cauliflower Pizza Crusts
6 ounces broccoli coleslaw mix
3 tablespoons very thinly sliced red onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup peanut sauce
2/3 cup diced cooked chicken
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place broccoli slaw and red onion on the parchment paper, drizzle with olive oil, and toss to coat.
Bake for 5 minutes; remove from oven, and set aside. Leave oven on.
Spread 1/2 of the peanut sauce on one of the pizza crusts. Top with broccoli-onion mixture, 1/2 of the chicken, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat with second crust and remaining ingredients.
Place pizzas directly on oven rack and bake until crust is golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
Sprinkle basil, cilantro, and mint on each pizza before serving.
