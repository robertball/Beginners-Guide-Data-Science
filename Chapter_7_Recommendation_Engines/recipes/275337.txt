Ingredients:
baking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup applesauce
1 cup apple cider
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 extra large egg, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Topping:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin pan with baking spray.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and kosher salt together in a bowl.
Whisk applesauce, apple cider, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Stir into flour mixture gradually until ingredients are combined.
Spoon batter into the prepared pan, filling each cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a donut comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before removing donuts from the pan.
Combine sugar and cinnamon for topping in a shallow dish. Brush donuts with melted butter on both sides and dip into sugar-cinnamon combination.
