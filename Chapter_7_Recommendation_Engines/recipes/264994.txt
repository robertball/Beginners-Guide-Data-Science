Ingredients:
1 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
Â½ stick butter
4 pounds frozen chicken wings, or more to taste

Directions:
Warm hot sauce and butter in a saucepan over low heat. Mix well after butter has melted.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill wings over direct heat until no longer sticking to the grate, 10 to 15 minutes. Do not peel off wings that are still sticking. Turn wings over and grill until halfway done on the second side, about 10 minutes more.
Dip wings, 3 or 4 at a time, into the sauce. Place coated wings over indirect heat. Grill until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Place wings in a large bowl. Cover with aluminum foil for 10 minutes or until ready to serve.

Description: 
This is a quick, easy, and tasty way of making grilled chicken wings. The taste is great and the mess is less. My brother and I came about this recipe through trial and error, and bouncing ideas off each other. We love it! This recipe is more about technique than ingredients. Frozen wings are required or they will overcook. The indirect cook time helps dry the sauce so they are not sloppy. You'll still need napkins, but much less mess on the face and hands.
