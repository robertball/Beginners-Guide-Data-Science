•	3/4 tsp garlic salt
•	3/4 tsp chili powder
•	1/2 tsp black pepper
Toppings (each)
-1 Tbsp sour cream
-1 Tbsp chopped green onions
-1 Tbsp grated sharp cheddar cheese
-1 Tbsp diced bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large bowl, toss potatoes with oil until well coated. Add all seasonings and continue to toss potatoes until evenly distributed. Place all potatoes directly on center rack in preheated oven. Bake 15 minutes then reduce heat to 350. Continue to bake for another 40 minutes until a toothpick inserted in center of potato offers little resistance. Slice lengthwise down center of potato, add toppings and serve piping hot.

Description: 
This is a nice spin on a classic favourite. When the skin gets left un-eaten, then most of the nutrients get tossed. Flavour it up a bit. You'll love it!
