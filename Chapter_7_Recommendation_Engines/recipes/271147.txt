Ingredients:
Crust:
10 graham crackers, crushed
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 ounces crushed walnuts
Filling:
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup whole milk
4 medium eggs
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
Topping:
1 (15 ounce) can blueberries in heavy syrup
2 cups shredded white chocolate

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and walnuts together in a bowl. Press crust mixture into the bottom of the prepared springform pan.
Combine softened cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until smooth, but do not overbeat. Blend in milk. Mix in eggs 1 at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Beat in sour cream, vanilla extract, and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Chill cheesecake for 1 hour before removing it from the springform pan.
Pour blueberries onto chilled cheesecake. Top with shredded white chocolate. Chill cake 6 hours before serving.
