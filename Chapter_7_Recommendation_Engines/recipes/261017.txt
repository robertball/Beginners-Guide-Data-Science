Ingredients:
2 pounds ripe quinces
2 organic lemons
1 1/2 quarts vodka
1 pound white sugar

Directions:
Rub quince with a kitchen towel really well until skin is smooth. Cut unpeeled quince into small cubes.
Peel lemon zest into spirals with a thin peeler. Squeeze lemons and measure 3/4 cup lemon juice.
Combine quince, lemon zest, lemon juice, vodka, and sugar in a large jar with a tight-fitting lid. All ingredients need to be completely covered with liquid. Keep in a warm place or on a sunny window sill for 4 weeks, shaking occasionally.
Line a sieve with a damp cheese cloth and strain liquid. Use a wooden spoon to press as much liquid out of quince pieces as possible. Pour strained quince liqueur into sterilized bottles and seal. Allow to mature for 6 weeks in a cool place.
