Description: 
This is an easy, healthy salad that is a great side dish to BBQ chicken, beef or fish!  It can also be easily adapted to a Tex-Mex style by changing the lemon to lime, parsley to cilantro and adding ground cumin and/or chili powder!  Be sure to add the lemon zest (or lime zest) as this really adds a ZING to the salad!
