Ingredients:
5 medium garlic cloves, peeled and grated
8 T butter, softened
1/2 tsp water
1/4 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1 (18-20") baguette, sliced in half horizontally
1 1/2 cup shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Oven rack to lower middle - oven to 400 degrees.
Cook garlic, 1T of butter and water in small nonstick skillet over low heat, stirring occasionally until straw-colored (7 to 10 minutes).
Mix hot garlic and remaining 7 T of butter, salt, and pepper in a bowl and spread on cut side of bread.  Sandwich bread back together and wrap loaf in foil.  Place on baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
Remove foil from bread and place halves, butter side up, on baking sheet.  Bake until just beginning to color (apx 10 minutes).  Remove from oven and set oven to broil.
Sprinkle bread with cheese and broil until cheese has melted and bread is crisp, 1 to 2 minutes.  Transfer to cutting board and *with cheese side down* slice into individual pieces and serve.
