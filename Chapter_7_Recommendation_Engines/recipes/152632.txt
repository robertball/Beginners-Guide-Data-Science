Ingredients:
32 OREO Chocolate Creme Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, divided
4 (8 ounce) packages PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 (8 ounce) package BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, melted, slightly cooled
4 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F if using a silver 9-inch springform pan (or to 300 degrees F if using a dark nonstick 9-inch springform pan). Quarter 20 of the cookies; set aside. Finely crush remaining 12 cookies; press firmly onto bottom of greased pan. Bake 10 minutes.
Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add chocolate; mix well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Gently stir in 1-1/2 cups of the quartered cookies. Pour over crust. Sprinkle with remaining quartered cookies.
Bake 50 minutes to 1 hour or until center is almost set. Run knife or metal spatula around rim of pan to loosen cake; cool before removing rim of pan. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Store leftover cheesecake in refrigerator.
