Ingredients:
2 cups frozen mango chunks
1/2 quart buttermilk
1/8 cup habanero peppers, seeded and minced
1/2 (1 ounce) package ranch salad dressing mix

Directions:
Using a food processor or blender, puree mangos until nearly smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and add buttermilk, minced peppers, and ranch salad dressing mix. Mix on low speed with an electric mixer until well combined. Add mayonnaise and continue mixing at low speed until dressing is smooth, about 2 minutes.
Refrigerate until dressing has thickened, 3 to 4 hours. Stir before using and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This spicy dressing with mango and ranch can be made even hotter by adding more habanero peppers. It makes a very large amount, but feel free to scale down.
