Ingredients:
Spice blend:
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon mustard powder
1/8 teaspoon celery salt
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 pinch ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Rice:
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup finely diced onions
2/3 cup uncooked orzo pasta
1 1/3 cups uncooked long-grain white rice
3 cups good-quality chicken broth
1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley

Directions:
Mix together salt, pepper, coriander, mustard powder, celery salt, paprika, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced onion and pasta. Cook and stir until onions soften and pasta turns golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in spice blend; cook and stir about 30 seconds. Add rice and stir until rice is coated with butter, about 1 minute.
Pour in chicken broth. Bring to a simmer. Stir; reduce heat to low. Cover with a tight-fitting lid; cook for 17 minutes. Remove from heat; let covered skillet sit for 5 minutes. Remove lid and stir in parsley, fluffing rice and breaking up any clumps.

Description: 
Here's my version of what's often called 'the San Francisco treat,' although the next time I see this served here will be the first time. I used real chicken broth and a variety of seasonings.
