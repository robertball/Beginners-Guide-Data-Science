Ingredients:
3  eggs, whites and yolks separated
1 ½ cups white sugar
½ cup butter
½ cup milk
1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
3 cups cubed bread

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.
Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread. Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. It is a favorite at Easter in my family. The egg whites add a touch of lightness to it.
