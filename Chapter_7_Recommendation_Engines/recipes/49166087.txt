Ingredients:
3 oz.		veal scallopini (3-4 slices)
3 extra 		jumbo shrimp or 5 large shrimp
1 Tbsp 	butter
1/4 cup 	white wine
1/4 cup 	sambuca
1/2 cup 	full cream
1/4 		lemon (juice)
Flour, Seasoning salt
Pasta noodles
Mixed vegetables: baby carrots, pea pods, fennel bulb (1/4 per person), 1/4 red pepper

Directions:
Parboil vegetables except peppers, in boiling water until just tender.  Drain and cool under ice water.
Roast peppers under a broiler or on the grille.  Place, hot, into a plastic bag for 5 minutes and remove skin, then slice into strips.  Combine all vegetables and set aside.
Lightly salt veal and coat in flour.  Set aside.
Heat butter in pan.  Saute shrimp until color just changes to pink, remove from pan and set aside.
Brown veal in pan, a few pieces at a time.  Add extra butter as needed.  Set meat aside.
Deglaze pan with wine and reduce by half. Add lemon juice.
Add sambuca, reduce by half. Add cream, then add veal and shrimp.  Simmer for 5-10 minutes to heat meat through and finish cooking shrimp.
While shrimp is heating through, season vegetables with salt and saut√© in butter just to heat them up.
Put veal and shrimp on a bed of pasta, add 1/2 cup of cream sauce and plate of vegetables on the side.
