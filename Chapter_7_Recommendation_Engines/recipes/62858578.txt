Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups small broccoli florets
6 ounces sliced portabella mushrooms
two 15oz cans black beanns, drained and rinsed
1 cup salsa
4 12inch tortillas or wraps
thinly sliced scallion, optional

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees
Steam the portabella slices in a skillet with a small amount of water, covered, until they soften.  Add the broccoli and continue to steam, covered, until it is bright green and tender-crisp.  Remove from the heat and drain.
Combine the beans and salsa in a mixing bowl.
Lay a tortilla on a baking sheet.  Spread one half of it with 1/4 of the black bean mixture, followed by 1/4 of the brocolli and mushroom mixture.  Fold over to cover.  Repeat with the remaining tortillas, using an additional baking sheet if needed.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until the tortillas begins to turn golden and crisp.
To Serve, place each quesadilla on plate.  Top with some Roasted pepper sauce with scallion if desire
