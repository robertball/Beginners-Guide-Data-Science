Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt, or to taste
1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust
1 cup thousand island salad dressing, or to taste
1 cup shredded American cheese
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 tomato, chopped (optional)
dill pickle slices (optional)

Directions:
Place the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Season with seasoning salt, drain off grease, and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread salad dressing on the pizza crust. Top with a layer of ground beef and onion. Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted. Allow pizza to cool for about 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and top with lettuce tomato and pickles, if desired.
