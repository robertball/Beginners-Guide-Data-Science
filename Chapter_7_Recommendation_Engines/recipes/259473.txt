Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 small apple - peeled, cored, and finely chopped
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup, or more to taste
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 dash ground cloves
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Combine turkey, apple, maple syrup, salt, sage, garlic powder, black pepper, marjoram, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl; mix well. Form into 10 small patties.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry patties until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
I love breakfast sausage, but most store-bought brands are high in calories and fat and not very diet-friendly. Try this slightly sweet version made with real maple syrup. The apples help keep the sausage moist. I like to cook up a batch on Sundays and store in the fridge for quick breakfasts all week. Take care not to overcook the patties.
