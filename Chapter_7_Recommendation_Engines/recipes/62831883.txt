Ingredients:
1 pound (about 2 ½ cups) dried black beans
6 cups water
4 cups veggie broth
¼ cup olive oil
6 - 8 cloves garlic, minced
1 ½ teaspoon each ground cumin and oregano leaves
2 teaspoons salt
1 ½ cup cooked brown rice
1 - 2 Tablespoons red wine vinegar
For garnish:
2 cups sour cream

Directions:
Rinse and sort beans, drain well.
Place beans and water in a 4 to 5 quart kettle and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer until beans swell and absorb most of the water, about 45 minutes.
Add broth and continue simmering, covered, until beans are tender, about one more hour.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add garlic, cumin and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant. Set aside.
In a blender or food processor (or with a hand mixer or by hand with a masher or fork) smash about 2 cups of the beans and a little broth until smooth; return puree to kettle.
Stir in 2 teaspoons salt, garlic mixture, rice and vinegar.
Cook over medium heat until steaming. Serve and top with sourcream, as desired.

Description: 
We make this recipe when we feel my brother needs to eat something real and hearty (the combination of black beans and brown rice make a complete protein).  He'll eat the whole pot!  This tastes delicious with cornbread.
