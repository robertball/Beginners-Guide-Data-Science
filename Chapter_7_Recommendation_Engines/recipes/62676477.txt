1 Boston butt or pork shoulder roast
1 large onion, quartered and sliced
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder
1 cup barbecue sauce, your favorite
1/2 cup vinegar
a teaspoon or two of liquid smoke, if desired

Directions:
Place pork roast in the crockpot; add chopped onion, salt and pepper and a generous sprinkling of garlic powder. Cover and cook on low for about 9 to 11 hours, or until very tender and shreddable.
