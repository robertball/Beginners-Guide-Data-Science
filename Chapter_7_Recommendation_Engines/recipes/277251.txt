2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups chopped red cabbage
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, crushed
5 cups water

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cabbage, celery, onion, and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in water and vegetable bouillon. Add diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and vinegar. Continue stirring, slowly adding sugar until broth reaches the desired sweetness.
