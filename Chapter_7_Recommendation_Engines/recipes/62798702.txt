Ingredients:
2 lbs potato, peeled and diced into 2" cubes
2 T oil
1/2 tsp black mustard seeds
1/4 c onions, chopped or thinly sliced
2 cloves minced garlic
1 to 2 green chilies, minced
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Boil the cubed potatoes for 5 mins, or until just starting to cook - not fully cooked, because they will turn to mush in the curry, but partially cooked so they will cook a bit faster in the curry.  Drain and set aside.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium to medium high heat.  Add the mustard seeds - they should start to pop within a few seconds, if not raise the heat a bit until they do.
Add the onion, chilis and garlic.  Reduce heat to medium and stir until the onion begins to soften
Add the dry spices except salt and stir well, about a minute or two, to take the "rawness" out of the spices.
Add the cubed, precooked potatoes and the salt.  Stir well to coat well with the spices.
Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until the potatoes are completely done.
If the potatoes were a little undercooked to start with you may need to add a small amount of water, cover, and let simmer a few minutes to completely cook them, but ideally they should finish cooking without doing that.  You may need to remove the pan lid once they have finished cooking all the way through to reduce any remaining liquid.
Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve over rice, or with naan, chapati, or puri.
