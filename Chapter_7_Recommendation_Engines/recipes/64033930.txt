Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Sea salt
1 tsp ground pepper
3 or 4 cloves of garlic minced
3 o 4 jalepenos chopped, without seeds
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
juice of 2 limes
juice of one orange
1 (2 - 4  pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 bay leaves
1 can of coke

Directions:
Mix together salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, oregano, juices in a bowl. Pour over pork, and let sit for an hour.Place the bay leaves and jalepenos in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour in the coke. Place rind of orange on top.
Cover and cook on Low, for 10 hours(or high for 3-4 hours) until the pork shreds easily with a fork. Turn the meat after it has cooked halfway. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat. I then fry it to get it crispy. Serve on small corn tortillas, warmed for small tacos. Serve with guacamole and salsa. And don't forget the margaritas!
