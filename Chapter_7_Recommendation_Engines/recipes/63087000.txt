Ingredients:
8 oz (dry weight) whole wheat rotini pasta, cooked al dente
1 cup edamame (shelled soy beans), cooked fork tender. (May be added to pasta water for the last minute of boiling time.)
2 tsp olive oil
1/4 c diced shallot
1/2 tsp salt
2 Tbsp whole wheat or all purpose flour
1 tsp ground mustard
1/2 c low fat or fat free milk
1 3/4 to 2 c low fat shredded cheddar cheese
2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 tsp freshly-ground black pepper (or to taste)

Directions:
In small bowl, mix together salt, flour and mustard powder.
In large saucepan, saute shallot in olive oil until translucent, about 2 minutes.
Add flour mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk. Stir until a roux is formed (paste-like consistency).
Add remaining milk and continue stirring until no flour lumps remain.
Add the cheeses and stir until smooth.
Add cooked pasta and edamame, mix until well combined.
For a creamier dish, add more milk 1 Tbsp. at a time until desired consistency is reached.
Top with cracked black pepper and serve immediately.
