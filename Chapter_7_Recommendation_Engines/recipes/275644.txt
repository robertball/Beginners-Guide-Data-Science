Ingredients:
1 head roasted garlic
2 cups shelled edamame
1/4 cup tahini
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon harissa
1 tablespoon water, or more as needed (optional)
salt to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins into the food processor bowl. Add edamame, tahini, lemon juice, and harissa; process until smooth. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the mixture seems too dry. Season with salt and pulse to combine.
Transfer hummus to a container or jar with a tight-fitting lid. Cover top with a layer of olive oil to prevent the surface from drying out. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
A whole head of garlic sounds like a lot for hummus but roasting it makes it very mellow, so the hummus is not garlicky at all. Like in hummus with chickpeas, I always add a little homemade harissa, which gives it great flavor without making it spicy.
 It's not worth turning on the oven for just one head of garlic so I always roast 3 or 4 heads at a time and use them within a week or so. This hummus keeps for 3 to 4 days, refrigerated.
