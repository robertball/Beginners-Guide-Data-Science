Ingredients:
Pork:
2 pounds boneless pork shoulder roast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Rice:
1 1/2 cups brown rice, rinsed well
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups water
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa verde (such as HerdezÂ®)
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon lime juice
6 (3-cup) storage containers

Directions:
Place pork cubes in a medium bowl. Add oregano, cumin, salt, coriander, and pepper and toss to coat meat evenly.
Rinse rice with cold water through a fine mesh strainer and drain.
Add 1 teaspoon oil to an oven-safe bowl that will fit inside your pressure cooker. Place rice and salt in the bowl. Add 1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon water and set aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 6-quart electric pressure cooker using the Saute mode on high heat. Cook pork in batches until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes per batch. Turn cooker off. Add salsa verde and stir to combine evenly.
Place a tall trivet inside the pressure cooker for the rice to sit on top of the pork. Place the bowl of uncooked rice on the trivet. Lock the lid and set the valve to 'Seal.' Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 24 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
Unlock and remove the lid. Remove the bowl of rice using oven mitts. Let cool slightly and stir in cilantro and lime juice.
Set the pressure cooker to Saute mode on medium heat. Cook until sauce is thickened, if desired, 8 to 10 minutes. Divide rice between 6 storage containers; spoon the pork and sauce on top. Refrigerate until ready to eat.

Description: 
Make weekly meal prep a breeze with this pressure cooker pork and rice. This recipe uses the Pot-in-Pot (PIP) method, which cooks the pork and rice in separate bowls at the same time. The pork turns out so tender! I like to freeze individual servings and take one out the night before. Top with queso fresco or sour cream when ready to serve.
