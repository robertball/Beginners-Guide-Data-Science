Description: 
This is a chili that you'll find in the Mountain West--either Colorado or New Mexico. It has a medium heat and complex taste, thanks to green chiles from Hatch, New Mexico. The dish is a simple stew with a cohesive taste across different textures and flavors, that can be thickened as you like it. Serve with bread, tortillas, rice, or even over a breakfast burrito!
