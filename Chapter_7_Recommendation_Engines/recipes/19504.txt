Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) jar clam juice
3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
8 slices bacon, cut into small pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, diced
2 quarts shucked clams, with liquid
2 cups half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat clam juice and peeled potatoes. Bring water to a boil and let simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.
Place bacon in a large stock pot. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Stir in onions and celery. Cook until vegetables are soft.
Add potatoes, clam juice and clams to the stock pot. Heat until simmering.
In a separate pot, gently warm (do not boil) half and half. Pour warm half and half into the stock pot and heat just until warmed through. Do not boil the chowder or the cream will separate. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is a rich clam chowder, but not as thick and pasty as some. Fresh shucked clams are recommended, but you may also use canned clams.
