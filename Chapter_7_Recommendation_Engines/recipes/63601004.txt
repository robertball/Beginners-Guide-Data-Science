Ingredients:
1 tsp. Cumin seeds
¼ cup roughly chopped dry whole red chilies
1 teaspoon dry red chili flakes
5 thinly sliced onions
4 lbs (one 12" green) pumpkin, washed and cubed with skin on
Salt to taste
1/3 cup oil
1 tbsp dry tamarind pieces (or other sour fruit: green mango, lemon juice)

Directions:
1. Heat oil and fry cumin and chilies until cumin browns. Add onions and fry until well softened and brown with 1 ½ tbsp salt to quicken the cooking.
2. When browned, add all pumpkin, mix and cover. Do not add water. Turn gas to low, and cook for 25-40 min or until pumpkin is soft and falling apart. You will need to stir frequently to prevent burning on the bottom.
3. Add tamarind, cook another 5 min. Stir pumpkin so tamarind is well incorporated. Serve with indian bread/roti. Makes a great meat side dish.
