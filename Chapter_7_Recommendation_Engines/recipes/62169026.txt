Description: 
I learned how to make these from my Italian mother-in-law.  She doesn't have any of her recipes written down - she just makes them like she always has for years.  They can be used in other dishes as well (brushchetta, pureed with cream over pasta, etc).  I usually just have them on the dinner table in a relish tray as a side dish to any meal.
