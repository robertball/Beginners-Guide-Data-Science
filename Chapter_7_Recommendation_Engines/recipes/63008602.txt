Ingredients:
1 pound butter, room temp
2 pounds peanut butter, room temp
3 pounds powdered sugar
1/2 block parrafin
2 - 12 oz bags chocolate chips

Directions:
Cream together butter and peanut butter until smooth. Add in powdered sugar until "dough" forms. You can roll at this point, but I usually refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. After rolling, place them on cookie sheets. I put down parchment paper so I don't have so much clean up to do. I'll also put them in the freezer for 4-5 hours or overnight after rolling. Makes them easier to dip.
In a double boiler, melt 1/2 bar paraffin wax and 2 12oz bags of chocolate chips (I use Nestle Semi-Sweet). We use toothpicks to dip them in the melted chocolate, place them back on your cookie sheets, then freeze or refrigerate until set. Keep under refrigeration. Can be stored up to 3 months in freezer (like they'd last that long...)
