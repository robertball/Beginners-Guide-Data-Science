Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon Sriracha
Chicken:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon soy sauce
cooking spray
1 teaspoon chopped scallions, or to taste
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Combine broth, sesame oil, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, cornstarch, garlic, and Sriracha for sauce in a medium saucepan. Whisk until cornstarch is dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low.
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Place chicken, cornstarch, and soy sauce into a bowl and stir until chicken is evenly coated. Transfer chicken to the basket of the air fryer. Spray with cooking spray.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes. Shake the basket, breaking up any pieces that have stuck together, and spray with cooking spray again. Continue to cook until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, about 8 minutes more.
Transfer chicken to a large bowl. Pour sauce over chicken and toss to coat. Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.
