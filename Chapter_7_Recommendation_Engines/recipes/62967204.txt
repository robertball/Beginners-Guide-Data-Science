Ingredients:
DOUGH
4 ½ teaspoons Fleischmann’s ®Rapid Rise™ Yeast
1 cup warm water (100° - 110°F)
½ cup granulated sugar, divided
2 large eggs
1 cup apple cider
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6  6 ¼ cups King Arthur Unbleached read Flour, divided
FILLING
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
½ cup confectioners’ sugar
½ teaspoon freshly grated lemon peel
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 2/3 cups peeled, cored, chopped Jonathan apple
¾ cup sweetened dried cranberries, chopped
¾ cup toasted pecans, chopped
GLAZE
2 cups confectioners’ sugar
½ teaspoon fresh lemon zest
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ cup apple cider
GARNISH
¼ cup toasted pecans, chopped, divided
¼ cup sweetened dried cranberries, divided

Directions:
1.	In mixer bowl, with paddle attachment, combine yeast, warm water, and 2 teaspoons sugar. Let stand 10 minutes. Stir in remaining sugar, eggs, cider, salt, lemon juice, ¼ cup vegetable oil, and 3 cups flour. Beat on low speed 2 minutes.
2.	Beat in 3 cups flour. Knead with dough hook until moderately soft dough forms, about
5 to 8 minutes, adding additional flour as necessary. Use remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to grease a large mixing bowl. Place dough in bowl, turn to grease top. Cover; refrigerate dough overnight.
3.	Remove dough from refrigerator and let stand 30 minutes.
4.	To make filling: In a small bowl, stirring with spoon, mix together butter, confectioners’ sugar, lemon peel, cinnamon, and vanilla. Set aside.
5.	Punch down dough; divide in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a 15 x 10-inch rectangle. Divide butter filling evenly and spread within 1 inch of edges of each rectangle. Sprinkle evenly with apples, cranberries, and pecans. Starting from long side, tightly roll up and pinch edges to seal.
6.	Using a floured knife, cut ropes lengthwise in half. With cut sides up, twist two ropes around each other to form a single piece. Place on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheets. Pinch ends together. Cover loaves, let rise 30 to 40 minutes, until puffy but NOT double.
7.	Bake in preheated 350°F oven 30 to 35 minutes or until golden and done. To prevent overbrowning, tent loaves with foil last 5 minutes.
8.	To make glaze: Mix all ingredients with spoon, beating until smooth.
9.	Drizzle glaze over cooled loaves. Garnish by sprinkling each loaf with 2 tablespoons cranberries and 2 tablespoons pecans.10
