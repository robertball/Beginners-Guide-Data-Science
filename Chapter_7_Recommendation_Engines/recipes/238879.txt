Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
1 cup red quinoa
3 red bell pepper, diced
1 bunch kale, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 tablespoons coconut oil
1/2 sweet onion, diced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup toasted slivered almonds
1 lemon, juiced and zested
1 tablespoon olive oil
sea salt to taste
fresh cracked black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa and red bell pepper. Return water to a boil, place cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook for about 10 minutes; add kale and continue cooking until quinoa is tender, about 5 minutes more.
Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; transfer to a large bowl. Stir feta cheese, almonds, lemon juice, lemon zest, and olive oil with the onion mixture; add quinoa mixture and stir. Season mixture with sea salt and cracked black pepper.

Description: 
We love quinoa, especially red quinoa. I like kale (the kids weren't so sure about kale). The kids loved this dish!  Everyone had seconds, even my picky eater. The combination of salty, sweet, and savory was awesome. Keeping in mind that I do the pinch-here-pinch-there style of cooking, this is easily adjusted to your personal taste. Next time I make this, I will be adding in some capers . . . because we like capers!
