Description: 
These cookies are delicious on their own but I like the extra zing you get from icing them with a lemon-powdered sugar mixture. Prep and freeze the cookie dough (will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months!) and when you're having a craving, slice and pop them in your air fryer and they will be ready in less than 10 minutes.
