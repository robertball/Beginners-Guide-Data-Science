Ingredients:
1/2 a head green cabbage
4 large carrots
1 cup cilantro, rinsed and roughly chopped or snipped with kitchen scissors
1/2 cup safflower mayonnaise (or regular mayonnaise)
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cracked pepper

Directions:
Using a kitchen knife, remove stem from cabbage. Cut in half from top to bottom. Either cut into long,
thin strips with the knife, or use the slicing attachment on your food processor to slice each chunk. Set aside in a large bowl.
Trim carrot tops (I leave the skin on, more nutritious, and it's not like you can tell the difference. Also, we're being lazy, remember? And peeling carrots... too much work). Grate using a box grater, or the grating attachment on your food processor. Add grated carrots to cabbage in large bowl. Add cilantro.
In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, honey, cayenne pepper, cumin, salt,
and cracked pepper. Drizzle over cabbage mixture. Toss to coat. Enjoy!

Description: 
Hey internet, let's be lazy together. Have you got a food processor? It was born for this. It takes about 30
seconds to make this slaw if you have one. And oh, ok, it takes a whopping 5 minutes to do things the
old fashioned way with a knife and a grater, but let's just be lazy together, shall we? It's summer.
