Ingredients:
5 cups unpealed diced potatoes
1/4 tsp celery salt
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup diced cooked ham
32oz chicken broth
1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or to taste
3 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery salt, onion, ham, pepper and broth in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
