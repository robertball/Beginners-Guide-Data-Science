Ingredients:
6 Roma tomatoes
4 zucchini
Bertolli® Extra Virgin Olive Oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper (to taste)
2 (6 ounce) balls buffalo mozzarella, cut into 3/4 inch slices
10 large leaves of fresh basil
Shaved Parmesan cheese
For Dressing:
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup Bertolli® Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Cut tomatoes into 1/2-inch slices, and zucchini lengthwise into 1/8-inch ribbons. Season both with minced garlic, salt and pepper and drizzle with Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Roast on grill with cut side up for about 10 minutes, or until nice and evenly roasted.
To assemble the salad: Place the tomato, zucchini (folded) and mozzarella on top of each other, like a tower, with a basil leaf in between layers. Season layers with salt and pepper and a drizzle of dressing. Sprinkle with shaved Parmesan on top.
