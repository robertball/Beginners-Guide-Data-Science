Ingredients:
1/2c all purpose flour
1/4c almond flour
1/4c regular rolled oats
1/4c fine corn meal
1/4c roasted golden flax meal
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2c Steve’s Maple flavoured syrup (we had it on hand)
1/4c milk
Very scant 1/4c vegetable oil
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 lg egg

Directions:
Combine cornmeal and milk. In a large bowl, whisk to combine dry ingredients very well. In a medium bowl, beat egg well, then add the rest of the wet ingredients to it. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients, and pour the wet into the well. Flick dry onto wet, then gently and swiftly fold all together just till barely combined.
Use muffin liners in a 6 muffin pan
Divide batter evenly.
We baked for exactly 19 minutes, with our pan set on a pizza stone, on the second from bottom rack. They did not brown on top, but were a little golden around the edges, and the bottoms were golden. These were nicely a little drier, with a crisp, tender crust.
We ate these hot from the oven, with butter, and had a couple of rashers of bacon and coffee, and they were great.

Description: 
I was messing around with Mary Kay Douglas’s Sweeter Muffin recipe, and we found we really liked the results. We tried to get a Sunny Boy feel to these, and also reduced the gluten. I think these would be great with raisins or chopped dried apricots. What were your results?
