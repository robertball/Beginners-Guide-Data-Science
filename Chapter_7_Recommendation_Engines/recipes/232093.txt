Ingredients:
1 cup orzo
4 teaspoons olive oil, divided
2 zucchinis, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced
coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup torn fresh basil
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, or to taste
1 clove garlic, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and spread onto a rimmed baking sheet to cool completely.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir zucchini and garlic in the hot oil until slightly tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Mix orzo, zucchini mixture, basil, vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to blend flavors, 1 hour to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.
