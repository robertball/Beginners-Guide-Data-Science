Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package honey roasted pumpkin ravioli
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound chicken tenderloins, tendons removed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh sage
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/8 cup fresh pumpkin puree

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook ravioli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until they float to the top, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Stir constantly until brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Season chicken tenders with salt and pepper and add to the skillet. Cook until internal temperature has reached 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and sage and cook, stirring, being careful not to burn. Remove chicken tenders and sauce to a rimmed plate.
Stir milk, cream, and pumpkin puree into the skillet. Add chicken tenders and ravioli to the skillet; toss to coat.

Description: 
This ravioli dish steps away from the traditional fillings and red sauce by using pumpkin-stuffed ravioli and a browned butter-pumpkin-sage sauce. The ravioli is seasonal and may be found at stores such as Aldi® or Trader Joe's®.
