Ingredients:
1 (6 pound) roasting chicken
1 teaspoon onion salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried savory
1/4 teaspoon grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon canola oil

Directions:
Place chicken on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Carefully loosen the skin above the breast meat. Combine the onion salt, thyme, savory, orange peel and pepper; rub half of the herb mixture under the loosened skin. Rub chicken skin with oil; sprinkle with remaining herb mixture.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F. Let stand for 10-15 minutes. Remove skin before carving. Skim fat and thicken pan juices for gravy if desired.
