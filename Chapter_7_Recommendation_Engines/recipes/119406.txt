Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato
1 green onion, chopped
1/4 cup canned kidney beans, coarsely chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1/8 teaspoon celery salt
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, saute the tomato, onion, beans, garlic, celery salt, chili powder and Worcestershire sauce in 1 teaspoon oil until liquid has evaporated; set aside and keep warm.
In a bowl, beat eggs and salt. Heat remaining oil in an 8-in. skillet over medium-low heat; add eggs. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When the eggs are nearly set, sprinkle vegetable mixture over one side. Fold omelet over filling. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover and let stand for 1-2 minutes or until cheese is melted.
