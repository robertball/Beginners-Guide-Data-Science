Ingredients:
1 gallon dill pickles
1 (5 ounce) bottle hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (5 pound) bag of white sugar

Directions:
Drain the brine from the pickles and discard. Slice pickles lengthwise, and return them to the jar. Pour in the hot pepper sauce, and add the garlic. Pour in about 1/3 of the sugar. Close the lid tightly. Gently tip the jar back and forth several times to allow everything to mix well. Leave out on the counter at room temperature for about 1 week.
During the week, add more sugar as the sugar in the jar dissolves. Gently tip the jar back and forth to mix. Continue the process throughout the week, until you have used up all of the sugar. When all of the sugar has been absorbed, pickles will be dark green and crispy. Transfer pickles to smaller sterile jars, and divide syrup between jars. Seal with lids and rings. Store in the refrigerator, and consume within one month.

Description: 
These spicy/sweet pickles are a Texas tradition.  My mother and I have made these delectable pickles for Christmas every year since I was young.  We separate each batch into smaller jars and give them as gifts to friends and family.  I would hate to think what would happen if we skipped a year!!
