Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups bread flour
FILLING:
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
6 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, butter, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Brush with melted butter; sprinkle Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic and oregano to within 1/2 in. of edges. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 rolls.
Place rolls cut side up in a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack.

An enticing combination of Parmesan cheese, oregano and garlic makes these buttery rolls impossible to resist. 'The aroma that wafts through the house while they are baking is incredible,' writes Patricia FitzGerald from Candor, New York.
