Ingredients:
2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled
4-inch lollipop sticks
1 (11 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
2 tablespoons milk
3 tablespoons chopped nuts

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Scoop 6 to 8 balls out of each apple using a melon baller. Dry each apple ball with a paper towel and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Poke each ball with a lollipop stick and refrigerate while making the caramel.
Place caramels in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in milk until sauce is smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool caramel slightly, about 5 minutes.
Dip apple pop in the cooled caramel, allowing excess caramel to drip back into saucepan.
Pour nuts into a shallow bowl and roll caramel apple pops in the nuts until coated; arrange, stick-side up, on the waxed paper.
