Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower (about 2 lb/1 kg)
3  cloves garlic
3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp salt
1-1/4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
1 large shallot, minced  (or œ cup/50 mL minced onion)
1 cup arborio rice
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup grated Canadian Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Trim cauliflower; cut into florets. In large bowl, toss together cauliflower, garlic, 2 tbsp (25 mL) of the oil and 1/4 tsp (1 mL) of the salt. Roast on greased baking sheet in 400°F (200°C) oven until golden and tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Mash garlic with fork.
Meanwhile, in small saucepan, bring broth and 1?cups (425 mL) water to boil; reduce heat to low and keep warm.
In large saucepan, heat remaining oil over medium heat; cook shallot and remaining salt, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes.
Add rice, stirring to coat and toast grains. Add wine; cook, stirring, until no liquid remains, about 1 minute.
Add broth mixture, 1/2cup (125 mL) at a time and stirring after each addition until most of the liquid is absorbed before adding more, 18 to 20 minutes in total. (Rice should be loose, creamy but not mushy, and still slightly firm in centre of kernel.) Stir in cauliflower, garlic, cheese and parsley. For a really creamy risotto, stir in cubes of Canadian Brie or Camembert instead.
