Ingredients:
1 Block 8oz Cream Cheese
4oz (or more) Butterscotch Sundae Syrup
2oz (or more) Fisher Nut Topping (mixed nut variety)
1-3 Granny Smith apples sliced into wedges

Directions:
Let Cream Cheese sit out until it is room temperature.  Place cream cheese in the middle of a plate or platter.  Spread cream cheese out with a butter knife to desired thickness.  Generously drizzle butterscotch topping all over cream cheese (butterscotch in a squeeze bottle is most convenient).  Sprinkle nuts on top of butterscotch.  Place apple slices around edge of plate/platter.  Serve and enjoy apple slices dipped in cool caramalized cheese dip!
