Saucy Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
6 chicken thighs, skin, and bone removed
1 large yellow onion, diced
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1 large can (28 oz.) diced tomatoes packed in their juice
2 tbsp. tomato paste
2 tbsp. dried rosemary
1 c. dry white wine
1/2 c. orange juice

Directions:
Trim chicken thighs of extra fat. (I use scissors for this.)
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil until quite hot, then add the chicken. (The hot oil will keep the chicken from sticking to the pan.) Cook chicken until lightly brown on all sides. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
Let the oil cool a bit and add the diced onion and garlic. Sautee on medium until the onion begins to turn translucent (about 6-8 minutes).
Add the diced tomatoes with their juice, the tomato paste, and the rosemary. Stir to blend well.
Add, wine, orange juice, and stir well.
Place the chicken pieces into the sauce and cover the skillet. Simmer for 40 minutes. If you have time, let the dish sit at room temperature until just ready to serve, then reheat. (It's tasty after the first cooking, but the flavors seem to blend more when allowed to sit for an hour or two.)
This is very good served over brown rice or soba noodles, but any rice or noodle works. It's a good idea to serve with a good loaf of bread to dip into the sauce.
