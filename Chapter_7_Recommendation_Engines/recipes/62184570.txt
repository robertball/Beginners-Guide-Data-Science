Ingredients:
2 sticks butter (1 cup), softened
2 cups finely chopped pecans
2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 tsp. vanilla
2 tbsp. water
Additional powdered sugar for rolling cookies in

Directions:
Preheat oven to 260 degrees.  Cream together the butter, flour, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, vanilla, water and pecans.  Shape into fingers or balls (about 1-2 tbsp. of dough) and bake on an ungreased baking sheet at 260 degrees for 45 minutes until slightly golden brown on the bottom of the cookies.  The larger the balls are the longer they will need to cook.  Cool on wire racks completely before rolling in powdered sugar.  These cookies are fragile so they must be cooled completely before rolling in extra powdered sugar.  Store in an air tight container with sheets of wax paper or parchment between the layers of cookies to keep them fresh.

Description: 
This has been my favorite cookie all my life.  I usually make them during the holiday season and give as gifts.  They are equally appreciated for baby and wedding showers and as hostess gifts.
