Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped candied cherries (optional)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Butter an 8-inch square pan.
Butter the sides of a heavy, 2-quart saucepan; add sugar, sour cream, corn syrup, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook until mixture comes to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture reaches 239 degrees F (115 degrees C) or until a small amount of sugar mixture dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove saucepan from heat.
Stir butter and vanilla extract into sugar mixture and cool to lukewarm, about 110 degrees F (43 degrees C). Beat mixture vigorously until fudge is creamy and no longer glossy. Fold cherries and walnuts into fudge; pour into the prepared 8-inch pan. Allow to cool until hardened, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Sour cream fudge is tangy and sweet, with a smooth texture enlivened by walnuts. This is an old family-favorite tradition that I remember my Uncle Carl making for the family at Christmas-time.
