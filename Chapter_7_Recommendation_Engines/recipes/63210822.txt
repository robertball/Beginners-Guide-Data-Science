Ingredients:
1/4 lb good-quality bacon, cut* into approx 1/4" dice
2 T honey
1/2 c butter, melted
1 c brown sugar
1/4 c white sugar
1-1/2 tsp vanilla
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 c flour
1/2 c cocoa powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease an 8" square baking pan.
Carefully fry bacon bits until nearly crisp. Add honey and stir until foaming subsides. Excluding the fat, remove candied bacon to foil, waxed paper, or a plate to cool.
Blend melted butter, sugars, and vanilla. Add eggs and blend. Sift flour, cocoa, and salt into egg mixture. Fold together. Break up candied bacon and briefly blend it into the batter along with the chocolate chips.
Pour batter into baking pan. Bake at 350 F for 25-35 min until an inserted toothpick comes out clean and the corners are just turning brown. Do not overbake.
Allow brownies to cool about 20 min and cut into 9-12 squares.

Description: 
The combination of salty bacon with rich chocolate sounds strange but is surprisingly delicious.
