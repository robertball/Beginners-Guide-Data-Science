Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup solid pack pumpkin puree
1/2 cup whole cranberry sauce
1 egg
1 banana, mashed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a large bowl.
Beat the butter, brown sugar, pumpkin, cranberry sauce, egg, and banana with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Pour batter into a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
