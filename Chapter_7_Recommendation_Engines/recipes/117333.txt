Ingredients:
2 tablespoons finely chopped carrot
2 tablespoons finely chopped celery
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon butter
1 (4.5 ounce) can deviled ham spread
2 cups biscuit/baking mix
1 tablespoon sugar
1 egg
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute the carrot, celery and onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat; stir in ham and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the biscuit mix and sugar. Whisk the egg and milk; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in cheese.
Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Make an indentation in the center of each muffin; fill with 1 tablespoon ham mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in muffin comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
