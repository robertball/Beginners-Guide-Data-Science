Ingredients:
3 cups diced rhubarb
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine rhubarb, white sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, egg, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a large bowl until evenly coated. Spread rhubarb mixture into the prepared baking dish.
Mix 1 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, oats, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry cutter or two forks until topping is crumbly. Sprinkle topping over rhubarb layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 40 minutes. Serve hot or cold.

Description: 
I modified this recipe with an extra 1/4 cup white sugar. I also added a modifier so that you can make extra streusel  to smash around the bottom and sides to form a crust. The crumble on the top is extremely delicious!
