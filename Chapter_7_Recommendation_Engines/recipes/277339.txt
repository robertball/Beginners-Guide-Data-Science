Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
4 hot dogs
1/2 (8 ounce) package processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed, or to taste
4 hot dog buns
4 sheets aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion and brown sugar and cook until onion is soft but not yet brown, about 5 minutes. Add ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a simmer. Remove from heat.
Cut a slit through each hot dog and fill with cubes of cheese food. Place dogs in buns and cover meat with onion sauce, about 3 tablespoons each. Wrap in aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot throughout, about 15 minutes.
