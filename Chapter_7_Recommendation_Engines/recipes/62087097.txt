Description: 
My 18 month old son spits out any vegetable we try to serve him the old fashioned way so I came up with a vegetable muffin recipe that is packed full of veggies that he loves to eat! They are dense, moist muffins that are not full of sugar or fat. Applesauce,yogurt and flaxseed (optional) add extra nutrition.
