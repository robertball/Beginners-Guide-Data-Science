Ingredients:
3 acorn squash
salt and pepper
olive oil
1 pound Italian sausage
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups Swiss chard leaves, chopped
1/2 cup water or stock
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons chopped walnuts
3 tablespoons bread crumbs
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sprinkle squash with salt and pepper and brush with olive oil. Place cut side down on baking sheet lined with parchment. Bake for 30 minutes until squash is tender. While squash bakes, prepare stuffing. Cook sausage in large non-stick skillet over medium heat 6-8 minutes, breaking up into small pieces. Drain and set aside. Wipe out skillet. Heat olive oil over medium heat and saut√© onion (3 minutes), add garlic (30 seconds), then add chard and water or stock. Stir and cook 3-5 more minutes. Mix sausage and chard mixture and scoop evenly into baked squash halves. Mix remaining ingredients in small bowl and spread evenly over tops of squash. Broil for two minutes until golden.

Description: 
This goes together pretty quickly since you can make the stuffing while the squash bakes. Tastes great on a chilly fall night!
