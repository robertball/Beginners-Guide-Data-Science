Ingredients:
2 cups instant oatmeal
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 banana, mashed
1 cup cashew milk
1 egg, beaten
3 tablespoons avocado oil
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Grind instant oats using a food processor to yield 1 1/2 cups oat flour.
Whisk oat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add banana, cashew milk, egg, and avocado oil and whisk until just moist. Stir in raisins and walnuts. Let batter rest while griddle preheats.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
We love breakfast at our house, but we don't love starting the day with a gluten-filled sugar buzz. These pancakes will satisfy your craving for carbs and sweets and fill you up without weighing you down. Also, you can modify them almost however you want!
