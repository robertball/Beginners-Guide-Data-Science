Description: 
Chicken breasts stuffed with soft cheese, wrapped in bacon, and drizzled with honey. Very easy and tastes amazing. I have lost count of the amount of times I have made this. It's a family favourite, and goes very well with either roasted vegetables, such as aubergine, peppers, courgettes, etc., & sauteed potatoes or salad and potato salad.
