Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup sprouted spelt flour
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 tablespoons water, or more as needed
Tarts:
8 ounces cold creamy fresh goat cheese
4 Black Mission figs, sliced
4 pinches kosher salt
4 tiny pinches cayenne pepper
1/4 cup white sugar
4 sprigs fresh lemon thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix spelt flour, olive oil, salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, with a fork. Starting with 3 tablespoons water, drizzle in just enough for dough to come together. Turn out dough onto work surface. Knead dough until it comes together. Crumble dough and press pieces into the bottoms of 4 small tart pans to form a 1/4-inch-thick bottom crust.
Crumble 2 ounces goat cheese onto each crust. Lay fig slices on top of goat cheese in a single layer. Season with a pinch of kosher salt, small pinch of cayenne pepper. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon white sugar.
Bake until cheese is bubbling and figs are glazed, about 25 minutes. Garnish with sprigs of lemon thyme.

Description: 
I wanted to make some sort of crostata or galette-type, free-form tart which I've done successfully in the past (and haveÂ the video to prove it). But instead of using standard pie crust dough, I decided to try something a little more rustic and savory, using spelt flour and olive oil. I knew this would pair beautifully with the sweet fruit and tangy cheese, but it ended up being way too crumbly. So, I just crumbled it into the bottom of a shallow ramekin and the rest is history.
