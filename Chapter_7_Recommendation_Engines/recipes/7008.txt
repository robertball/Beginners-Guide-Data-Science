Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 1/2 cups scalded milk
4 egg yolks, beaten
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
5 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fruit preserves

Directions:
Cream shortening and sugar together.  Stir in salt, hot milk, beaten egg yolks, and flavoring.  When lukewarm, add yeast to mixture.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Add flour, beating well.  Knead down into bowl.  The dough will be slightly sticky.  Let rise 1 hour.
Cut off small balls of dough.  Roll into rounds in your hands, and place on greased cookie sheets 2 inches apart.  Let rise 15 minutes.
Make a depression into the center of each roll.  Fill with fruit preserves.
Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) until brown.  Watch carefully.  Cool on wire racks.
