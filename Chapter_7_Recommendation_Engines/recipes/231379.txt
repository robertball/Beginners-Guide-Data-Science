Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (14 ounce) package frozen mixed red, yellow, and green bell pepper strips, thawed and drained
2 pounds 93% lean ground turkey
1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray.
Puree peppers in a blender until smooth; pour into a bowl. Add turkey and bread crumbs to bowl; mix. Form the turkey mixture into a loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
I created this on a cold day when I didn't want to go to the store. I came up with this using just what I had in the house. With only 3 ingredients it couldn't be easier. You can also make mini loaves or meatballs with this recipe.
