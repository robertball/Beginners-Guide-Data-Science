Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (3 ounce) package Oriental flavored ramen noodles
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble in the ground beef, and cook until no longer pink, stirring frequently. Drain off grease.
Stir in the flavor packet from the noodles, tomatoes, and corn (with their juices). Break up the noodles slightly, and add them to the skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, or until noodles are tender. Stir occasionally to break up any clumps of noodles.
