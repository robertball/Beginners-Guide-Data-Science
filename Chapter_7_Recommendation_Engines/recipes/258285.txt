Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup minced onion
1 cup frozen corn, thawed
1 tablespoon taco sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons taco seasoning mix
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons water
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 (8 inch) corn tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Drizzle 4 1/2 teaspoons olive oil over diced sweet potatoes in a bowl. Add garlic and salt. Toss to coat potatoes in oil. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until tender, about 40 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add corn and cook until corn begins to brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in taco sauce, taco seasoning, and coriander. Add water and bring to a simmer; simmer gently until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
Stir roasted sweet potatoes and black beans into the skillet to coat with sauce. Spoon mixture over tortillas.
