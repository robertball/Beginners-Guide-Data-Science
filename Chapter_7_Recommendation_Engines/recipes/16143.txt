Ingredients:
3 russet potatoes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/3 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup shredded carrots
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill weed
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese for topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Peel potatoes and slice 1/4 inch thick; set aside.
Heat oil in a medium-size skillet; saute onion until soft. Stir in flour, mustard, celery seed and salt.  Gradually add water and vinegar; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils and thickens.
In a mixing bowl, combine the potatoes, green pepper, carrots and dill; add sauce and mix well. Spoon half the mixture into a shallow 8x8 inch baking dish and sprinkle with half the cheese. Cover with remaining potato mixture and cheese.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and vegetables are heated  through.
