Ingredients:
1 6 oz can crabmeat (drained)
1 12 oz pkg whole mushrooms (stems removed, finely minced, and put aside)
1/4 cup white wine
3/4 cup dry stuffing mix, crushed into crumbs
1/4 cup white onion, finely minced
1/2 cup grated fresh parmasean cheese
1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning
black pepper to taste
1 egg
1 whole roasted red pepper from jar, packed in water
1 Tbsp butter
3 cloves garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease cassarole with butter or non-stick cooking spray.
In a skillet, saute finely minced mushroom stems with onion and butter. Cook until most of the liquid is cooked out, then remove from heat.
In a food processor or mini-chopper, mix stuffing mix crumbs and crab meat.  Add egg and process again.  Add mixture to partially cooled onion and mushroom mix.
Process garlic, roasted red pepper, italian seasoning, black pepper, and parmasean cheese.  This will be the liquid for your mushroom stuffing. Add this mix to your mushroom/crab mixture.
Spoon stuffing into mushroom caps. Arrange caps in cassarole. Pour wine into bottom of cassarole for caps to sit in while baking.
Bake in 400 degree oven for 30 min.  Turn oven down to 300 and bake an additional 15 minutes to dry out stuffing further.
Serve warm - delicious with marinara sauce to dip!

These always disappear quickly from parties, and are perfect for a movie night on the couch.  I love rummaging through cupboards and making new creations from whatever I have handy - this is one of my family's favorites that I've come up with!
