Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
3 pounds chuck roast, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons bacon drippings

3 medium onions, chopped
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup water
6 carrots, chopped
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Combine flour, salt, celery salt, garlic salt, black pepper, and ground ginger in a small bowl.  Sprinkle the mixture evenly on to the beef.
Heat a large heavy-bottomed pot on medium-high heat.  Add the bacon drippings.  Brown the beef in the pot, stirring as necessary.  Drain excess fat.
Add the diced tomatoes, onions, vinegar, molasses, and water to the pot and bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for 2 hours.
Add the carrots and raisins and simmer for an additional 30 minutes, or until the carrots are tender.  Serve with steamed rice.
