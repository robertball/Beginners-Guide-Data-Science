Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 skinless, boneless chicken breast, diced
4 cups water
1 1/2 teaspoons dashi granules
1 (3 ounce) package ramen noodles
cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/2 cup miso paste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove to a plate.
Bring water to a boil in a medium pot. Add dashi and whisk until granules have dissolved. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add ramen noodles, mushrooms, and cooked chicken; simmer until noodles are tender, about  2 minutes.
While soup is simmering, spoon miso paste into a bowl. Ladle about 1/2 cup of the hot broth into the bowl and whisk with the miso until a smooth paste forms. Add paste to the soup, turn the heat off, and whisk until incorporated. Sprinkle with green onions and serve immediately.
