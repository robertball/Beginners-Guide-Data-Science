Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter                 1 tsp basil
2 cloves garlic, minced        1/2 tsp pepper
1 cup chopped onion            3 cups chicken broth
1 cup chopped celery           1 cup half and half
1 cup chopped baby carrots     1 can peas, drained
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
2-3 cups diced, cooked chicken meat
2 cups Bisquik
2 teaspoons dried basil
2/3 cup soured milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the garlic, onion, celery, and carrots in butter until tender. Mix in the flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon dried basil, and pepper. Stir in broth, and bring to a boil. Stirring constantly, boil 1 minute, reduce heat, and stir in peas. Simmer 5 minutes, then mix in chicken. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
In a medium bowl, combine the baking mix and 2 teaspoons dried basil. Stir in milk to form a dough. Drop dough on chicken mixture to form 6-8 biscuits.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cover with foil, and bake for 10 more minutes. To serve, spoon chicken mixture over biscuits.
