Ingredients:
2 cups Bisquick or other biscuit mix
8 oz. room-temperature cream cheese, divided into 3 oz. and 5 oz.
1/4 c. plus 1 TBS. softened butter (not margarine)
1/4 c. powdered sugar
1/3 c. milk
8 oz. jar apricot preserves
Preheat oven to 400 degrees

Directions:
Mix biscuit mix, milk, 3 oz. cream cheese, and 1/4 c. butter well until dough is formed.  Press the dough into greased muffin tins, reserving some to cover the tops when filled, set aside.  Mix other 5 oz. cream cheese and 1 TBS. butter.  Add powdered sugar to make a pudding consistency- it may not take the whole 1/4 cup.  It should taste slightly sweet but not overpoweringly so.  Fill the muffin tins 1/2 full with the cream cheese mixture, then top with about 1 TBS. of the apricot preserves.  Then press the remaining dough over the tops to seal the cream cheese and preserves inside.  Bake in oven for 12-14 minutes- this will turn a very pretty light pastry color when done.  Do not overcook!
