Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans turkey chili with beans, undrained
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn bread/muffin mix
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or as desired (optional)
1 tablespoon sour cream, or as desired (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour the turkey chili into a 9-inch pie dish. In a bowl, whisk together the corn bread mix, milk, and egg until slightly lumpy; spoon the corn bread batter on top of the chili.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of the corn bread begin to brown and the center is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

Description: 
Simple, inexpensive -- and my children gobble it up!  My 9 year-old has even made this for us. :0) Note: you will need whatever ingredients the cornbread mix calls for.  JiffyÂ® calls for 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk.  Egg substitute works well, too.
