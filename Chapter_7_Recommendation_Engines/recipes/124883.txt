Description: 
When I first developed this version of hot chocolate, my husband was quite skeptical. But after one taste, his doubts were erased. In fact, he was the one who suggested I send it to Country. It really hits the spot on a chilly morning, especially when served with cinnamon rolls or doughnuts.
