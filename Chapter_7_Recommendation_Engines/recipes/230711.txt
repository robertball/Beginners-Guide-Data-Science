2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 cup packed brown sugar

1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk both amounts of flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Beat butter, brown sugar, and pudding mix in another bowl with an electric mixer until blended; beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until combined. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
Roll the dough into 2-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
