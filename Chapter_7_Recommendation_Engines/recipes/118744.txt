Ingredients:
1 pound smoked kielbasa or Polish sausage, julienned
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute the sausage; cool. In a bowl, combine the sausage, cheese, one egg, parsley, onion salt and garlic salt; mix well.
Unroll pizza dough; roll into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle. Spread sausage mixture down the center of dough. Bring dough over filling; pinch seams to seal. Place seam side down on a greased baking sheet; tuck ends under. Beat remaining egg; brush over top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
