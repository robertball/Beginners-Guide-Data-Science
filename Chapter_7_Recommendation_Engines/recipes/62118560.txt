Asian Steak over Rice Recipe

Ingredients:
16-24 oz. steak
1/2 cup soy sauce
3-5 Tbsp white sugar
olive oil
salt
6 cloves of garlic

Directions:
Rub steaks all over with garlic.  Make sure to get ever inch of the steak, switching cloves in between.  You may also cut each clove in half to rub the inside of the garlic on the steak, if you prefer lots of garlic (I do!)
Then, lightly sprinkle with salt
Then lightly coat with a thin glaze of olive oil.
In a skillet or stove-top pan, sear outside of steak.  I prefer mine to be Rare to Med Rare but whatever temp you like your steaks at is just fine.  If you prefer it more cooked, Med-Well Done, turn your heat lower and cook for longer.  Remove from heat once the desired temperature is reached.
Set aside steaks on cutting board.
Using the leftover juices from the skillet, turn the heat on med-high and stir constantly to avoid burning.  Add in your soy sauce and sugar, again, stirring vigorously to avoid your sauce burning.
When the sauce begins to caramelize, boil or melt, remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.  The sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.  This should yield about a half cup of sauce.
Now back to the steaks, slice steaks into thin strips, or however you desire your steaks to be cut.  I prefer 1/2 in strips but thicker or thinner is just fine.
Lay strips over a small bowl of rice, or next to a side of rice.
Slowly drizzle your sauce over the top of the steak and rice.  The sauce is extremely rich so a little sauce goes a long way!
ENJOY!
