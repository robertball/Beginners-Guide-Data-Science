Description: 
These spicy little snacks go QUICK whenever I make them!  They are beyond simple to make, and so much fun to eat!   Try mixing it up a little and use pretzel nuggets, peanuts, saltine crackers, little melba toasts, or even Goldfish crackers instead of the oyster crackers for an interesting change of pace.
