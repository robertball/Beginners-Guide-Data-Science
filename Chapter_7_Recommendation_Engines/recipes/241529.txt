Description: 
These energy balls are an awesome snack! They have a great balance of quick energy fuel, protein from the nuts,  powdered milk, fiber, slow-burning carbs from the flour, oats, and wheat germ, and good-for-you fats! They are also filling and, best of all, absolutely delicious. 

They are good for about a week. 

Bon Appetite!
