Mix sugar, matzo meal, oil, eggs, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, walnuts, and salt together in a bowl; pour into prepared baking dish.

Description: 
This recipe is based on a recipe I found online I wrote down the ingredients on a shopping list but was unable to find the recipe again, so I decided to post it here with the adjustments I made to it. It was really a big hit with my family and doesn't taste Passover-y at all. Hope you all enjoy.
