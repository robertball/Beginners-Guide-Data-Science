Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
1/2 tsp of mustard powder
1/4 tsp of onion powder
1/4 tsp of garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1.5 cups milk
1/2 cup of table cream
1 2/3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk and cream. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Top the potatoes with half of cheese sauce mixture, then add the remaining potatoes. Pour rest of cheese sauce over the next layer of potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil or lid.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.
If you want you can remove lid/foil for the last 15 minutes of cooking to get a browned topping.
