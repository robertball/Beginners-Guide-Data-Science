Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup shortening
1/4 cup white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups cold water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix together flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast in a bowl. Add shortening and mix well. Mix in water.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead by hand for 20 minutes, or by machine for 12 to 14 minutes. Toss dough with vegetable oil in a bowl; cover the bowl and let proof for 1 hour.
Form dough into 24 rounds, and place on a greased baking tray. Cover and let proof for 45 minutes more.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 14 minutes.
