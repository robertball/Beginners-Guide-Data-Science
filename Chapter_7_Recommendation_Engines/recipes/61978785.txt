2 cups peeled, cubed potatoes
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
1 1/4 cups milk
1 Tbsp. cornstarch
2 tsp. vegetable bouillon granules
couple of grinds of black pepper
1 tsp. Dijon mustard
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese.
nonstick spray
4 hard-cooked eggs, sliced
1 tomato, halved and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a saucepan, cook potatoes and onion, covered, in boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Add mixed vegetables and cook 5 minutes more, or until tender. Drain.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, stir together milk, cornstarch, bouillon granules, and pepper. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Stir in cheese and mustard until cheese is melted.
Spray a 2-quart round baking dish with cooking spray. Spread the vegetables in the bottom of the dish. Top with the egg slices. Pour sauce over all.
Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Arrange tomato slices on top. Bake 5 minutes more, or until heated through.
