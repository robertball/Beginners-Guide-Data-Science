Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/8 teaspoon paprika
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 Cornish game hens
1/2 cup white wine
1 (15 ounce) can tart cherries, drained
1 1/2 cups red wine
1/4 cup pulp-free orange juice
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine sea salt, black pepper, thyme, garlic powder, rosemary, and paprika in a bowl. Place hens on a baking sheet and evenly brush with 5 tablespoons butter. Rub hens with spice mixture.
Bake hens in preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours, basting every 1/2 hour with white wine.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
Mix cherries, red wine, orange juice, and brown sugar in a saucepan; bring to a boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir in 2 tablespoons butter, and cook until sugar is dissolved and butter is melted, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour into the sauce; whisk until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle cherry sauce over cooked hens.

Description: 
This was an idea I had for a long time but never got around to doing it and it came out fantastic couldn't have hoped for better. My wife and I loved it. The tart cherries complement the flavorful rub on the hen perfectly. For golden brown crispy skin increase temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for last 10 minutes of cooking.
