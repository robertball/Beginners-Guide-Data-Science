Ingredients:
1 Cured Ham - any cut (I used 10lb)
1 Cup Very Strong Coffee or Expresso
4 Tablespoons sugar
3/4 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon
1/4 Teaspoon Ground Cloves

Directions:
Mix coffee, sugar and spices together and set aside.
Use your nose and tongue but remember all these flavors fade into deep ham flavor goodness - very little "spice" flavor imparted into ham.
Make cuts in outer layer of ham - diagonal are most visually appealing.
Place 1/4 cup coffee/spice liquid in bottom of slow cooker.
Place ham in cooker, flat side down.
Drizzle spoon by spoon the coffee/spice liquid over top - up to a 1/2 cup more - use your nose! Reserve remaining liquid for later if needed.
Tightly foil seal top of slow cooker since lid will probably not fit.
5-8hrs on Low Setting.
Periodically - starting half way through cooking - baste with juices in bottom.
You can periodically turn ham to penetrate more surface areas if desired.

Description: 
Straight from the chuckwagon days, coffee & spice takes this ham to deep HAM flavor levels, with no hint of coffee/spices in the end for those not a fan of our favorite bean! Slow cooker does the all day job perfectly!
