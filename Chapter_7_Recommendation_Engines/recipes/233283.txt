Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough
5 teaspoons pesto
10 links breakfast sausage
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Press each biscuit into a 4-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Spread 1/2 teaspoon pesto over top of each biscuit. Place 1 sausage link on the edge of each biscuit and roll dough around sausage. Cut each roll into 4 pieces and place on a baking sheet; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown and sausage is cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.
