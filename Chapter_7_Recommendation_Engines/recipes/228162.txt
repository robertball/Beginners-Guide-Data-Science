Ingredients:
3 large carrots, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 red potatoes, chopped
3 parsnips, chopped
2 small turnips, chopped
3 celery ribs, chopped
1/2 cup lentils
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3 cups water, or as needed
1 teaspoon salt
12 biscuits
1/2 cup grated Colby Jack cheese (optional)

Directions:
Combine carrots, onion, red potatoes, parsnips, turnips, celery, lentils, garlic, oregano, rosemary, and thyme in a large pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables and lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more water if needed.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
Pour cooked vegetables and lentils into the prepared pan. Gently layer biscuits atop the vegetables. Sprinkle with Colby Jack cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are bubbling and cheese is browned, 20 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This melange from underground veggies is a great way to use up those leftover biscuits from brunch before they turn into hockey pucks. But if you don't have leftover biscuits, it works well to use biscuits from a can or quickly whip up your favorite family recipe!
