Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey
1 pound turkey sausage, casings removed
1 egg
3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir onion and garlic until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes; remove from heat.
Stir ground turkey, turkey sausage, egg, parsley, onion mixture, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Use an ice cream scoop to measure 8 equal portions; pat each portion gently into a burger shape.
Pan fry the burgers in a large skillet over medium-low heat until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the burgers should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees F).

Description: 
The subtle flavours of turkey sausage, blended together with sauteed onion and garlic, make these burgers moist and flavourful. Great on a bun or on their own. Enjoy with your favourite toppings.
