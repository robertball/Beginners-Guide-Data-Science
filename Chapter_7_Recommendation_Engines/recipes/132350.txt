Ingredients:
4 slices rye bread
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 teaspoons mayonnaise
4 teaspoons hot chicken wing sauce
2 slices Swiss cheese
1/2 cup sauerkraut
8 slices deli turkey

Directions:
Preheat a large skillet over medium heat.
Lightly coat one side of each slice of bread with olive oil; lay out the slices, oiled side down, on a plate. Spread 1 teaspoon mayonnaise and 1 teaspoon of hot sauce on each slice. Top two of the slices of bread with a slice of Swiss cheese and 1/4 cup of sauerkraut. Arrange the turkey on the other two slices of bread. Bring the two halves together.
Fry the sandwiches in the preheated skillet until the bread is golden brown on both sides and the cheese has melted.
