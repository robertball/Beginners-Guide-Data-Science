Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup canola oil
1 packet ranch dressing
3 tablespoons red pepper flake
4 sleeves saltine crackers

Directions:
1) Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl  for a good long while (5-10 minutes), to really get the crackers coated.
2) Lay them out on a cookie sheet and drizzle the yummy, ranchy, peppery oil that's in the bottom of the bowl, over the top of the crackers.
3) Bake at 250 degrees for 15-20 minutes, stirring them around about halfway through.
4) Let them cool and store in a big ol' baggie. Or a few little baggies.
