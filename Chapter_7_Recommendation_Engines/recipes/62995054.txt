For your own batch to bake:
3 eggs
1 cup oil (or 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup apple sauce)
1/2 cup milk
1 cup sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups flour
1 box instant vanilla pudding
1/2 tsp baking soda

Directions:
Do not use any type of metal spoon or bowl for mixing

Day 9: Mush the bag
Day 10: Follow the instructions below:
Pour entire contents of the bag into a non-metal bowl.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and 1 1/2 cups milk.  Measure out 4 separate batters of 1 cup each into four 1-gallon Ziploc bags.  There will be batter left over in the bowl.  Keep one starter bag for yourself and give three others to your friends with copies of this recipe.  It is helpful to mark each bag with the date of Day 1 (the day you've prepared these four bags).
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
To the remaining batter in the bowl, add:
3 eggs
1 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1 cup sugar
2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups flour
1 box instant vanilla pudding
1/2 tsp baking soda
(You can add whatever else you like too, like nuts, chocolate chips, whatever tastes good!)
Grease 2 large loaf pans and mix additional ½ cup sugar with 1 ½ tsp cinnamon.  Dust the greased pans with half the mixture.
Pour the batter evenly into the 2 pans and sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over the top.
Bake 1 hour.  Cool until bread loosens from the pan evenly (about 10 minutes).  Turn out onto a serving dish.  Serve warm or cold.
If you keep a starter for yourself, you will be baking every 10 days.
