Ingredients:
3 tbsp butter
2 heaping tbsp white flour
3 cups milk
1.5 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese
1 tsp mustard
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
You will need two pots for this recipe. Pour the milk into one pot and heat very gently until quite warm.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in the second pot and add the white flour. Allow to bubble about a minute over low-medium heat.
Slowly incorporate the warm milk, stirring well with a whisk. Once all the milk has been added, allow to thicken over medium-low heat for about 6 minutes.
Once the milk mixture coats the back of a spoon, gradually add the grated cheddar cheese and mustard, mixing as you go. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Heating the milk first makes this sauce incredibly velvety so you won't have to suffer with a grainy texture.
