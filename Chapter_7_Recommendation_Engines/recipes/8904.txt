Description: 
It is a very delicious West Indian meal which can be eaten with rice, roti,  bread or by itself. It uses garam masala, a blend of dry roasted, ground spices from the colder climes of northern India. 'Garam' is the Indian word for 'warm' or 'hot'; garam masala adds a sense of 'warmth' to both palate and spirit, and can be purchased in Indian markets and in the gourmet section of some supermarkets.
