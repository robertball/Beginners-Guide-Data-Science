Ingredients:
3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup clam juice
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 cup sliced green onions
4 cloves garlic, sliced
1 anchovy fillet
2 pinches red pepper flakes
12 ounces halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
salt to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 pinch minced fresh rosemary

Directions:
Puree cherry tomatoes and clam juice in a blender until smooth. Press mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl.
Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, green onions, garlic, anchovy, and 1 pinch red pepper flakes in a cold plan. Place over medium heat. Cook and stir until garlic and onions just start to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato mixture. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer stew until color deepens, about 10 minutes.
Add halibut and shrimp to the stew. Season with salt. Increase heat to high. Cover pan and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Pour stew into a warm bowl. Drizzle in remaining olive oil and sprinkle 1 pinch red pepper flakes on top. Serve with crusty bread.

Description: 
I spent a few days in Florence about 30 years ago, and while I don't remember much, I do recall my surprise at how delicious the Tuscan fish stew was. What I found so interesting was how herbs like oregano, sage, and rosemary, which I'd only associated with meat, were also used with seafood. Also, FYI just in case any old-school Tuscans are coming over: I hear that for this to qualify as an official Italian fish stew you need use at least 5 different types of seafood, which is both insane and adorable. Serve with crusty bread.
