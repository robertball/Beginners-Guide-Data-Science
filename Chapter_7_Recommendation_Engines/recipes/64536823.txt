Title:
Linda's Easy Rotel Casserole Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
12 oz cooked chicken (can use canned) or tuna
8 oz medium egg noodles, or pasta
1 can of mild "Rotel" tomatoes with green chilies, drained
1 can of green beans, drained
1 can cream of chicken soup
Shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
If using canned chicken or tuna, drain it.
Cook the egg noodles in boiling water for about 6 mins.  (If using pasta, cook about 10 mins.)  In a large bowl,  combine all ingredients except cheese, and stir to combine.  Then pour these ingredients in an ungreased casserole dish (my dish is 7" x 12").   Top with shredded cheese - as much or little as desired.  (I used about 3/4 cup).  Bake for 20-25 minutes, then serve.
Note:  Can probably experiment with different veggies.  (Corn, peas, etc.)  If using frozen veggies, I would suggest defrosting in microwave before adding to casserole.
