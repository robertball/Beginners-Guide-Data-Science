Ingredients:
6 thick slices bacon
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1 tablespoon barbeque spice rub, or to taste
4 thin slices prosciutto
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced into long strips
2 sticks pepper Jack cheese
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce, or to taste
1 cup French-fried onions

Directions:
Arrange bacon slices side by side, facing lengthwise, on a sushi mat.
Mix ground beef and spice rub together in a large bowl. Spread in a thin layer over bacon, leaving 1 inch of bacon uncovered on the end furthest from you. Cover beef with prosciutto. Line jalapeno strips across the end closest to you. Place cheese sticks next to jalapeno strips.
Roll up bacon tightly towards the uncovered end.
Preheat grill to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grill bacon roll seam side-down over indirect heat until crisp, about 25 minutes. Brush some barbeque sauce on top. Continue grilling until barbeque sauce is glazed, about 5 minutes. Add remaining barbeque sauce; grill for 5 minutes more.
Remove from grill and coat evenly with fried onions. Slice and serve with chopsticks.
