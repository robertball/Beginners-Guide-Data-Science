Ingredients:
10 ounces spaghetti
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 (5 ounce) package arugula, torn
2 tablespoons shaved Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook garlic until translucent and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes. Increase heat, cook, and stir until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Remove skillet from heat and mix in arugula. Mix in cooked spaghetti and drizzle with olive oil. Serve immediately with Parmesan cheese.
