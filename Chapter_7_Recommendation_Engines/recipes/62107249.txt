Ingredients:
1 pizza dough/frozen dough package
2-3 tbsp of flour for dusting
2 pablano peppers (thinly sliced)
4 jalapenos (thinly sliced)
1 sweet red pepper (thinly sliced)
1 onion (thinly sliced)
1 1lb bag of shredded mexican mix cheese
1 tbsp of olive oil
2 tbsp of melted butter
2 cloves garlic

Directions:
Roll out the pizza dough, dusting the flour on the counter and dough as needed so that it doesn't stick.  Try to make it into a rectangle shape.
Place on a cookie sheet.
Heat oil in a frying pan and saute the garlic, onion, and peppers until tender.
Spread the mixture on the entire rolled out dough, try to get close to the edges.
Sprinkle the cheese on top of the mixture.  You can always add more cheese if you like.
Then roll the dough like a pinwheel so it forms a long log.
Place in the oven at 350 and bake for 45 minutes or until center is baked through.
After about 30 minutes spread the melted butter evenly oven the log and let brown.
Once the bread is done, let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
You can slice each slice in half to make smaller bit size pieces.
