Ingredients:
Bread:
3 cups white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
2/3 cup water
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
1 cup gluten-free baking mix (such as Bisquick® Gluten Free®)
2 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
Icing:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix white sugar, pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, eggs, and water together in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk baking flour, baking mix, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into pumpkin mixture until batter is just blended. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.
Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and milk together in a bowl using an electric mixer until icing is smooth. Spread icing over pumpkin bread.
