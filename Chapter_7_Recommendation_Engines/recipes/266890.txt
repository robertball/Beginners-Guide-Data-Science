Ingredients:
Pastry:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
7 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons ice-cold water, or as needed
Filling:
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
3 large tomatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon oregano
2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Mix flour and salt in a food processor. Add the butter in small pieces and mix into a crumbly dough. Add ice-cold water 1 teaspoon at a time until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll out pastry dough on a lightly floured surface so it generously fits in a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Line tart pan with the dough in such a way that extra dough is sticking out 1/3-inch over the edge of the pan.
Brush dough lightly with mustard and sprinkle with Gruyere cheese. If tomatoes are very juicy, drain some of the liquid. Arrange tomato slices like roof tiles on the cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is solid, about 40 minutes.
Combine parsley, oregano, garlic, and olive oil in a small bowl. Remove tart from oven and brush with herb mixture while still hot. Serve warm or reheat in a microwave oven.

Description: 
This tomato tart alone is a good enough reason for me to look forward to the next tomato season. Nothing quite compares when you have a bumper crop of tomatoes from the garden. Serve as a starter or a main.
