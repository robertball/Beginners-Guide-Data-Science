Ingredients:
2 egg yolks
1/2 tsp. salt
2 Tbsp. powdered sugar
3 Tbsp. lemon juice (OR) 3 tablespoons vinegar
1 1/2 c. oil
1 1/2 Tbsp. flour (OR) 1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch
1 tsp. dry mustard
1/4 tsp. paprika
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 c. boiling water
2 Tbsp. vinegar
salt

Directions:
Using an electric mixer or blender, blend egg yolks, salt, sugar and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice (OR) vinegar.
Slowly pour in 1 cup oil, a few drops at a time, mixing thoroughly.  (Important to add only a little at a time, otherwise it will not set up correctly.)
Add remaining 1/2 cup oil a little faster, carefully blending in each bit before adding the remaining 2 tablespoons of vinegar (OR) lemon juice.
Mix the flour, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, boiling water, and vinegar together until smooth.
Pour into a small saucepan and cook until smooth and paste-like (but not too thick).
Slowly add this hot mixture to the mayonnaise and blend well.
Pour in a container and cool in the refrigerator.
