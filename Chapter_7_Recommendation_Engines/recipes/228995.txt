Ingredients:
1/2 cup cold peach-flavored tea
2 tablespoons cornstarch
4 cups diced peaches
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Whisk tea and cornstarch together in a small bowl; transfer to a saucepan. Add peaches; cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until just boiling, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in white sugar, brown sugar, and nutmeg; simmer over medium-low heat until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken.

Description: 
Make this up in advance for sourdough pancakes. I used Celestial SeasoningsÂ® tea. Substitute water for tea if you don't have it on hand. Chopped pecans might taste good in this, as well as brandy instead of vanilla.
