Description: 
This recipe has lots of flavor with minimal effort, it's like take-out made right in your own home well at least my husband thinks so. I also like to use chicken legs or thighs, double the sauce and simmer it in the crock pot with onions and bell peppers.Orange or pineapple juice work just as nice in this dish.
