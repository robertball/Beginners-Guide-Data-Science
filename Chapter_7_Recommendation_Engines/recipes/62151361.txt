Ingredients:
6 medium potatoes, diced
1 small onion, diced
1 lb andouille sausage, diced
1 clove or 1T garlic, chopped
2 T olive oil or butter
1/4 cup white wine or chicken broth
Salt and pepper, to taste
Cayenne pepper, to taste (optional)
3 green onions, sliced, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
In a large skillet, lightly saute onion and andouille in olive oil or butter over medium heat until the onions are translucent and andouille begins to brown.  Add potatoes, wine or broth, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed and potatoes are almost tender.  Uncover and season to taste with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper, if desired.  Increase heat to brown potatoes, stirring occasionally.  Garnish with green onions & serve.

Description: 
This twist on classic American comfort food is as spicy and smoky as the andouille (ahn-dew-WEE or AHN-dew-ee) you use. With a fried egg or two, this hash moves into sublime dinner fare at our house.
