Ingredients:
One pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2" strips
2 T vegetable or olive oil
2 tsp chili powder
2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
One can diced tomatoes with chiles (similar to Rotel)
One medium onion, sliced
One large bell pepper, green or red (I like to use the mini bell peppers for a more colorful and flavorful dish)
12 tortillas, 6 inch (I prefer Mission tortillas if you don't make your own)
Toppings as desired-cheese, sour cream, guacamole, etc.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place chicken strips in a greased 13Ã—9 baking dish.
In a small bowl combine the oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, and salt
Drizzle the spice mixture over the chicken and stir to coat.
Add the tomatoes, peppers, and onions to the dish and stir to combine.
Bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Serve on tortillas with desired toppings.
