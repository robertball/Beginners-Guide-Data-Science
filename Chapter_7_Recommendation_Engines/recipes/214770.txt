Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 eggs
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
4 (4 ounce) beef tenderloin fillets, pounded thin
2 links pork sausage
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups heavy cream
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a bowl, stir together 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt, white pepper, and garlic powder. In a separate bowl, beat eggs with garlic and parsley. Dredge each tenderloin fillet in seasoned flour, dip in egg mixture, and dip back into flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour.
Gently place the steaks into the hot oil, 2 at a time, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
Place the sausages in a small skillet over medium heat, and fry them until very dark brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Finely chop the sausages, and set aside. In the same skillet, melt butter, and stir in 3 tablespoons of flour. Cook the butter-flour mixture until it turns a pale beige color, about 1 minute, then stir in the sausage, cream, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over the fried steaks.
