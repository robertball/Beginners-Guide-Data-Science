Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 3/4 cups all-purpose white flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup applesauce
1/2 teaspoon maple syrup
2 large eggs
3 ripe bananas, mashed, or more to taste
1/2 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt
1/3 cup low-fat milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons brown sugar, or to taste (optional)
ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat an 11x7-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
Whisk together applesauce and maple syrup in a large bowl. Add eggs and whisk until well blended. Add bananas, yogurt, and milk; mix until combined but still lumpy. Whisk in vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Fold flour mixture slowly into banana mixture with a large wooden spoon until fully combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Slice and serve.

Description: 
Tired of throwing out old bananas? This recipe is a moist, flavorful, and low-fat way to save those bananas and keep your kids coming back for more. No white sugar here. Good old maple syrup, non-fat Greek yogurt, and applesauce make great alternatives to the usual banana bread recipe!
