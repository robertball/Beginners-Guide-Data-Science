Rockin' Ramen Bento Recipe

Ingredients:
3 ounce package chicken flavored instant ramen noodle soup
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 cup cubed cooked chicken breast (ground chicken also works)
2 baby carrots, diced
6 asparagus tips
1 green onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped baby spinach
squirt of Sriracha *optional*
Thinly sliced mushrooms and bean sprouts are also nice additions. You can use any vegetable combo you like but just remember to cut them very small so that they will cook in a short amount of time. I have used the frozen pea/carrot combo and they work good too.

Directions:
Crumble the instant noodles in a medium sized microwavable to go container with lid.
Sprinkle half of the season packet over the noodles and discard the rest of the packet.
Add the remaining ingredients, put the lid on, and refrigerate until lunchtime.
Remove the lid and add 2 cups of water to your noodle bowl. Microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Let stand 3 minutes before digging in.

Description: 
Instant ramen noodles get a face-lift by eliminating some of the sodium and adding protein and freshness. Once you've jazzed one up like this,  it will be hard to go back to eating them straight out of the package.
