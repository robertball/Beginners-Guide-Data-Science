Ingredients:
FOR SUGAR GLASS:
2 cups water
1 cup light corn syrup
3 1/2 cups sugar
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
FOR EDIBLE BLOOD:
1/2 cup white corn syrup
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/8 to 1/4 cup water
15 drops red food coloring
1-5 drops blue food coloring
CUPCAKES:
1 package of white cake mix (and ingredients required by mix)
1 jar of white icing

Directions:
FOR SUGAR GLASS: In a large sauce pan mix water, corn syrup, sugar and cream of tartar and bring to boil. Place a candy thermometer on pot and keep boiling until temperature reaches 300 degrees (hard tack), stirring constantly- I cannot stress this enough, you don't want it to burn. The mixture will will thicken as most of the water evaporates. After mixture reaches 300 degrees quickly pour into a metal baking pan. Once the sugar glass has cooled and completely hardened, use a tenderizer or other heavy ended implement to carefully break into "shards" of glass. Set aside.
FOR EDIBLE BLOOD: In bowl mix together corn syrup and corn starch. Add water until mixture is the consistency of blood. Mix in food coloring. Set aside.
FOR CUPCAKES: Prepare cupcakes according to the directions on package. Allow to cool completely and then frost the cupcakes. Now for the fun part, stab each cupcake with a few shards of broken sugar glass. Finally add a few drops of "blood" to complete the effect.

Description: 
I made made these cupcakes for my nephew's birthday and they turned out so creepy that I thought I would share them here for Halloween.  I tried out a few different methods for sugar glass and included the method which produced the clearest glass for me.
