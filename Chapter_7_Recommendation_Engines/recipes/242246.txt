5 eggs
1/4 cup whole milk
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
2 slices Black Forest ham, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
2 tablespoons diced onion
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 slices toasted thick-cut bread, cut into 1-inch squares
1 cup diced vine-ripened tomato
1/2 cup diced cucumber
salt to taste

Directions:
Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir eggs until about halfway-cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Add ham and onion to eggs; cook and stir until eggs are set and ham and onion are lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat and stir sour cream into egg mixture.
Layer bread cubes into 2 bowls; top with egg mixture, tomato, cucumber, and salt.

Description: 
A wonderful breakfast bowl I came up with by looking around the kitchen for available ingredients. My wife said 'Can you make this again, exactly the same?' Decided I better type it up to be sure I can.
