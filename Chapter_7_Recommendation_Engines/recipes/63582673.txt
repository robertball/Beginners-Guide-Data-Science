Bread Machine Coconut Bread Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1.5 tsp active yeast
1.5 c flour (bread or all-purpose)
.5 c desiccated coconut
1 tsp salt
.75 c coconut milk
.5 c shredded coconut (sweetened or not), optional

Directions:
This works for my 2 cup capacity bread machine, so adjust amounts as necessary for your bread-maker.
The directions for my bread machine require that all ingredients be at room temperature and added in the order they are listed.
The machine has a signal for adding nuts, etc, at about 40 minutes, which is when I put in the shredded coconut.
This can be made start to finish according to your bread maker's directions.
I sometimes prefer to just make the dough in the machine, then cover it and let it rise about an hour, until it has doubled in size.  Then bake it in the over at 325 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this when a friend of mine had to cut out dairy for her nursing baby.  It's rather simple and delicious!
