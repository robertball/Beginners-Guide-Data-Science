Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package fudge brownie mix, batter prepared as directed on box
1 (14 ounce) package caramels, unwrapped
3 tablespoons whipping cream
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with foil.  Pour prepared brownie batter into foil-lined pan, and bake until brownies begin to pull away from the sides, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool completely.
Lift brownies from pan in one piece.  Use a 3 inch heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut 6 brownie hearts.
Combine caramels and whipping cream in a large bowl.  Microwave on High for 1 to 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until caramels are melted and cream is incorporated.  Drizzle caramel sauce decoratively on brownie hearts.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans, if desired.
