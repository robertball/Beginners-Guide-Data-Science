Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 links FarmlandÂ® Beer Bratwurst
1 pound mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 cups diced yellow onion
3/4 cup diced carrots
3/4 cup diced celery
4 garlic cloves, sliced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard
2 cups Cheddar cheese, grated
Salt and pepper, to taste
3 soft pretzels
3 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In heavy-bottomed saute pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add sausages and cook until browned on all sides until just cooked through. Remove, and once cooled, slice into rounds.
To same pan, add mushrooms and cook until well browned. Add onions, carrots and celery. Cook until softened, add garlic, and cook for additional 2 minutes.
Add red pepper flakes and fresh thyme, followed by flour. Reduce heat and cook for 2 more minutes to cook raw taste from flour.
Add chicken stock and heavy cream, and bring to simmer, whisking frequently.
Add mustard and cheddar cheese, and stir to incorporate. Add reserved sausage and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to individual ovenproof serving dishes.
In food processor, or by hand, roughly chop pretzels to make crumbs. Toss with melted butter and top each serving dish with crumb mixture.
Bake until golden brown and warmed through, approximately 12 to 15 minutes.
