Ingredients:
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 large green tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs in a separate bowl. Pour flour into a third bowl.
Pour in enough vegetable oil to measure 1/2-inch in a large skillet; add olive oil. Heat oil mixture to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dredge each tomato slice in egg; coat with flour. Dredge through egg again and press into panko mixture until evenly coated.
Fry coated tomato slices in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove fried green tomatoes with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper plate or paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt.
