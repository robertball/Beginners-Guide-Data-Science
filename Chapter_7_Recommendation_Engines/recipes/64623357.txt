Ingredients:
2 large chicken breast pounded thin
1 TBS olive oil
4 slices thick cut ham
1 cup of grated motzarella cheese ( or any cheese you like )
3/4 cup of good white wine
1.5 cups mild
2.5 TBS flour
2 TBS butter
1 TBS lemon juice
2 tsp mustard powder
Salt/ Pepper

Directions:
Salt and pepper both sides of chicken.  Sprinkle half a cup of the cheese on each chicken breast.  Place the ham on top of the cheese and roll as tight as you can and secure with toothpicks.  Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium high heat.  Cook chicken about 4-5 minutes on each side.  Remove the chicken from the pan.  De-glaze the pan with wine and scrap all the pieces from the skillet and heat until reduced 1/3, about 7 minutes.  Add the butter and stir in the flour.  Cook for about 2 minutes making sure not to burn the flour mixture.  Slowly whisk in the milk and stir constantly until thickened.  Stir in the lemon juice and mustard powder.  Season with salt/pepper to taste.  Add the chicken and coat with the sauce.  Place a lid on the skillet and simmer for 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.

Description: 
The sauce in this makes it stand above the rest.  It eligent enough for company but easy enough for a weeknight meal.  You can use any type of cheese you like.  I normally service this with multi grain rice and steamed fresh spinach.
