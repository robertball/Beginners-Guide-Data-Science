Ingredients:
1/2 stick butter
2 cups converted long-grain white rice
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken broth

1 teaspoon salt
3 bay leaves

Directions:
Melt butter in a pot over low heat. Pour in rice and stir to coat in butter. Let simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally, until toasted but not burnt, about 10 minutes.
Pour chicken broth, lemon juice, salt, and bay leaves into rice mixture. Bring to a rapid boil; continue to boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes.
Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.
