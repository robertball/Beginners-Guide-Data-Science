Ingredients:
4 boneless pork chops (each 6 ounces and about 3/4 inch thick)
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
For Garnish
Fresh basil
Halved or quartered cherry tomatoes

Directions:
Place a pork chop between two layers of plastic wrap on work surface. Using a meat pounder, pound to 1/4-inch thickness. Repeat with remaining pork chops. Transfer to a large resealable plastic bag or nonmetal container. Add balsamic vinegar and oil. Marinate, covered, in the refrigerator 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove pork from marinade; season with salt and pepper. Grill until cooked through and browned on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Serve hot, garnished with basil and tomatoes.
