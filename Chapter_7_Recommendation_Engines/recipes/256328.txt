3 1/4 pounds pork ribs

1/3 cup white wine
2 tablespoons tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, crushed

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pork ribs on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
Whisk hoisin sauce, sugar, soy sauce, white wine, tomato paste, garlic, chili-garlic sauce, and five-spice powder together in a bowl.
Grease a slow cooker insert with cooking spray. Transfer pork ribs to the pot. Cover evenly with hoisin sauce mixture.
