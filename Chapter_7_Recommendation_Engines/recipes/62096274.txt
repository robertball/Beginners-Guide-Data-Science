Ingredients:
1/4 c olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1# kale, rinsed, stems removed, and coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
12 oz. andalusian or portuguese chorizo (if you use mexican chorizo, be prepared for a really spicy dish)
8 small red potatoes, diced
1 can (15 oz.) chickpeas, drained
1 tomato, peeled and diced (or, 1 can (15 oz.) diced tomatoes -- don't drain them!)
Salt and pepper to taste
8 c water

Directions:
Clarify onions in olive oil.  Add chorizo and garlic.....
NOTE: if using mexican chorizo, you can't dice that.  You have to make it into "meatballs" and fry them until done.  I would suggest that if you're using mexican chorizo, make and fry your meatballs in a separate pan since they're so spicy they'll almost overpower the rest of the soup....
After adding the chorizo and garlic, cook for a couple of minutes to set the chorizo and meld the garlic before adding the potatoes and chickpeas.
Cover the ingredients in the pot with the water.  Bring it to a boil and then lower the heat, simmering until the potatoes are done (about 20 minutes).
Add tomatoes with their juice and the kale.  Bring everything back to a boil and simmer for a few minutes, until the kale is tender but not before it loses its color.
Season with salt and pepper to taste and ladle into bowls.  Serve with a hearty, crusty bread for dipping.
