Ingredients:
3 large, Fresh Eggs
1 13 ounce can Sweetened Condensed Milk
1 can 13 ounce Evaporated Milk
12 to 16 ounces (depending on your mood but 12 ounces minimum) of high quality Canadian blended or yes, maybe Irish Whiskey
1 TSP Vanilla Extract
1 TSP Coconut Extract
1 TSP Instant Coffee, dry, not in solution
1 TBSP Chocolate Syrup

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a glass bowl and stir together just enough to break up the egg yolks.  Empty all contents of the bowl into a blender and blend on highest setting for 3 minutes.  Pour into glass container with lid.  I prefer the larger wine bottles with screw on cap.  Refrigerate and age in refrigerator for two weeks minimum.  Then enjoy the best Irish Cream you've ever had for cents on the dollar.

Description: 
Once you try this, you'll wonder why in the world you've been paying all that money at the liquor store for a mediocre Irish Cream when you can have world class quality here for a fraction of the cost AND from a real Irishman.
