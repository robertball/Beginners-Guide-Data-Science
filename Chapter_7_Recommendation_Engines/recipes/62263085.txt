Ingredients:
1 cup margarine, softened
1 cups white sugar
4 eggs
3 cups self-rising flour
1 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups raspberry jelly

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in the flour and milk, alternating so the dough does not become too stiff or too runny. Mix in vanilla. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the center springs back when pressed lightly. Spread the raspberry jelly over the cake while it is warm, but not hot, so it will soak into the cake.
