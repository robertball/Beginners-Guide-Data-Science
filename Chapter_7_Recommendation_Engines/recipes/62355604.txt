Ingredients:
5 ears of corn, schucked
1/2 C small-diced red onion
3Tbs cider vinegar
3Tbs Olive Oil
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 C julienned fresh basil leaves.

Directions:
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the corn for 3 min until the starchiness is just gone.  Drain and immerse it in ice water to stop the cooking and to set the color.  When the corn is cool, cut the kernals off the cob, cutting close to the cob.
Toss the kernals in a large bowl with the red onions, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Just before serving, toss in the fresh basil.  taste for seasonings and serve cold or at room temperature.
This says to blanch the corn, but if you had leftover corn from the grill I think that would be yummy too and if you are in a pinch, you could use frozen or canned corn as well.
