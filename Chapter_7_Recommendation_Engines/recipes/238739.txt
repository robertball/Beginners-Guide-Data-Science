Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, cut into chunks
4 stalks celery, cut into chunks
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup tequila
1 (28 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
2 cups vegetable stock
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 lime, juiced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add green bell pepper and jalapeno peppers to onion mixture; cook and stir until peppers are softened, about 5 minutes.
Pour tequila into vegetable mixture and simmer until slightly reduced, 3 to 4 minutes. Add fired-roasted tomatoes, vegetable stock, crushed tomatoes, lime juice, salt, and pepper to vegetable-tequila mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have blended, about 20 minutes. Stir cilantro into soup just before serving.

Description: 
Simple, inexpensive, and hearty. My boyfriend and I love this different take on boring tomato soup. Best of all, it is very low in calories. Add shrimp for a protein boost.
