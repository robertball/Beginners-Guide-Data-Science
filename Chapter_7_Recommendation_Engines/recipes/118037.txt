Description: 
'My German father-in-law loves to vacation in Greece,' relates Jerry Lappin of Garden City, Kansas. 'After a stay on the sunny beaches of Rhodes, he game me the recipe for this zesty salad, full of fresh tomatoes, red onion, green pepper, ripe olives and feta cheese. I like to serve it for a light lunch with sourdough, French or Italian bread.'
