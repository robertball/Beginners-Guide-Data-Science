Cut the tomatoes about 1/4 inch thick
Wisk together in a small bowl the mayo & milk until smooth and toss in the cut tomatoes, the mixture should thicken a bit after about a minute.
Mix together the Tajin fruit seasoning & flour, by this time the oil should shimmer a bit and be ready for frying.
Coat the tomatoes slices in the flour mix.
Then fry the tomatoes in the oil about 4 a time, don't crowd them for best results.
They should be flipped half way through cooking time.
When done let rest on some paper towel & sprikle with salt.
