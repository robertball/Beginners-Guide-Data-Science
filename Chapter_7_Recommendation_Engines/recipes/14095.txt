Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package silken tofu, undrained
2 tablespoons safflower oil
1 pinch salt
2.3 cups turbinado sugar
1 cup cocoa powder
.3 cup instant decaffeinated coffee powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup whole wheat flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Using an electric mixer, blend tofu until creamy.  Add oil, salt, sugar, cocoa, coffee and vanilla and blend well.
When sugar is dissolved into the tofu mixture remove the bowl from the electric mixer and whisk in flour.
Pour batter into a greased 9x13 inch baking pan.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cake pulls away from the side of the pan. The bars will appear glossy, almost underdone. Cool in the pan and when cool cut into bars using a clean, wet knife.

Description: 
Not all that bad for you, vegan, and rich as the best fudge torte.  These bars keep well and are very moist. Turbinado is unrefined sugar.
