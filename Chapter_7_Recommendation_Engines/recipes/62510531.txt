Ingredients:
3 T white flour
Cold water
1 C very hot water
1 T white sugar (optional)

Directions:
Make a thin mixture of flour and cold water (just enough to wet all of the flour and make it liquid enough to pour.
Pour the cold mixture slowly into the hot water while stirring constantly. Bring to boil.
When it thickens, allow to cool.
Smear on like any other glue.
For slightly better strength, add 1 T of sugar after the glue is thickened.

Description: 
If you are doing a project requiring a lot of glue, this is the stuff you'll want to use. If has the same peel test strength as white glue, but it's a lot cheaper. 
(Word to the wise, store it in the refrigerator or it gets pretty rancid smelling!)
