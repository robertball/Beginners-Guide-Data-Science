Ingredients:
¼ cup (60mL) warm nonfat milk
1 ½ tsp instant coffee granules
3 tbsp (45mL) pure maple syrup
1 cup (80g) unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Add the warm milk and instant coffee to a small bowl, and stir until the coffee has completely dissolved. (It will take a few minutes!) Stir in the maple syrup. Add in the cocoa powder, and stir with a fork until completely incorporated. (It takes a bit of effort!) Chill the chocolate mixture for at least 30 minutes. (If chilling for longer than 2 hours, cover the top of the bowl. with foil or plastic wrap to prevent the chocolate mixture from drying out.)
Line a baking sheet with wax paper.
Remove the chocolate mixture from the refrigerator, and roll it into 16 small spheres. After shaping each truffle, place it on the prepared baking sheet. Once all of the truffles have been formed, transfer them to an airtight container. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
