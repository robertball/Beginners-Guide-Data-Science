Ingredients:
40 banana peppers (5 inches long), stems removed
4 cups prepared yellow mustard
5 cups white sugar
1 cup honey
4 cups apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup water

Directions:
Remove the seeds from the banana peppers and place the peppers into a blender or food processor. Process until smooth. Pour into a large pot and stir in the mustard, sugar, honey, apple cider vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil, so that it is boiling so hard it cannot be stirred down.
Stir together the flour and water until smooth. Pour into the boiling mixture. Continue to boil, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Pour into sterile pint jars and seal with new lids and rings. Process in a boiling water bath for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your altitude.
