Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon bacon grease
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp and browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and reserve 1 tablespoon bacon grease. Crumble bacon once drained and slightly cooled.
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine sugar, syrup, and salt in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave oven until bubbling, about 4 minutes.
Stir bacon, pecans, reserved bacon grease, and vanilla extract through the sugar mixture; heat in microwave oven for 3 minutes more. Immediately add baking soda and stir just until foamy.
Working quickly, spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Let cool until set, about 15 minutes. Break into bite-size pieces.
