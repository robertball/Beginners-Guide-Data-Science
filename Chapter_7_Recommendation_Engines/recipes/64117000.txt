Ingredients:
12 Large Fresh Scallops
2 Cups Buttermilk
2 Cups All Purpose Flour
1/2 Tablespoon Ground Black Pepper
1/2 Tablespoon Salt

Directions:
Heat deep fryer to about 400ÂºF
Fill one small bowl with buttermilk, then fill a separate small bowl with flower, salt and pepper.
Take about 4-5 scallops and put them in the buttermilk, make sure they they covered completely with buttermilk.
Remove the scallops from the buttermilk and place them in the flour mixture. Roll around the scallops until they are covered in a think coat of flour that doesn't fall off of the scallop.
Drop the flour coated scallops into the fryer for about 3-4 minutes until scallops are cooked completely and flour coating is golden and crispy.
Set fried scallops onto a paper towel to soak up extra oil.
Repeat steps 3 through 6 until all scallops are fried up.
