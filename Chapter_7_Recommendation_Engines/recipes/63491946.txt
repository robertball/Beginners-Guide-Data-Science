Ingredients:
Aunt Mariah's Lemon Sponge Cups
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup sugar
4 tablespoons flour
1 lemon, grated rind and juice
1 1/2 cup milk
3 eggs, separated
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.
In a large bowl, cream butter. Add sugar, flour salt, lemon juice and rind.
In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks; stir in milk. Slowly add second mixture to first mixture.
Beat egg whites until stiff; gently fold into mixture. Pour into ramekins or individual souffle dishes and place in pan of hot water.
Bake for 45 minutes.
You will have a layer of lemon custard, with gorgeous, lightly browned sponge on top. Let cool a bit. Turn out and serve with whipped cream, or serve still in the dish. You can also bake this in one large souffle dish. Aunt Mariah likes to garnish with a thin slice of lemon.
