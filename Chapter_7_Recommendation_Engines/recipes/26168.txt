Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 tablespoons brandy
1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup golden raisin and cherry dried fruit mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and brandy. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips and dried fruit mix.  Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies taste best when taken from the oven while still slightly doughy. Cool on cookie sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
