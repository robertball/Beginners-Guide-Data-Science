Ingredients:
2/3 cup quick cooking pearl tapioca
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Bring the tapioca, coconut milk, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar until dissolved.
Beat the egg in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot tapioca mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, then scrape the egg mixture into the simmering pudding, and stir. Simmer gently until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes , then remove from the heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes before stirring in the vanilla extract. Serve either warm or chilled.

Description: 
I have always loved tapioca pudding and coconut, so this dish is perfect for me! One time, for a 'Southeast Asian Cuisine Night,' I served this as dessert alongside pho, spring rolls, and steamed dumplings. For a Southeast Asian touch, top the pudding with chopped mango or chopped peanuts.
