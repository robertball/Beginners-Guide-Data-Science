Ingredients:
2 cups diced papaya
1/2 red onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon hot chile paste, or to taste
4 (6 ounce) tuna steaks
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
3 eggs
1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts

Directions:
Combine the papaya, onion, and red pepper in a bowl. Add the cilantro, lime juice, garlic, and hot chile paste. Toss to combine, then refrigerate until ready to serve.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Brush the tuna steaks with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl until smooth. Dip the tuna steaks in the egg, and allow excess egg to run off. Press into the macadamia nuts.
Cook the tuna steaks on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium. Serve with the papaya salsa.

Description: 
I recently read about the health benefits of macadamia nuts so I thought Iâ€™d share one of my favorite recipes that combines them with grilled tuna.  It's a great healthy summer recipe!
