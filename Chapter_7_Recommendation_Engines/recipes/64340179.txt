Ingredients:
1 tsp olive oil
1 medium onion, medium dice
2 medium carrots, medium dice
2 medium garlic cloves, minced
1 celery stalk, medium dice
2 cups additional vegetables of your choice (such as red pepper, cabbage, asparagus, fennel, zucchini, squash, green beans or peas), medium dice
1 bay leaf (optional)
1 pinch dried thyme (optional)
1/4 cup white wine (optional)
4 cups (1 quart) low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, medium dice
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Heat olive oil & a little broth in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.
2 Add the carrots and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.
3 Add the celery and, if using, any hearty vegetables (such as cabbage and fennel) and the bay leaf and thyme. Season again with salt and pepper and cook an additional 5 minutes. If using, add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the alcohol has reduced by about half, about 2 minutes.
4 Add the broth, potatoes, and any quicker-cooking vegetables (such as asparagus and squash). Let the soup come to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and gently simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork, about 15 to 25 minutes. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper as needed.
