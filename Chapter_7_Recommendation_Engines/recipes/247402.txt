2 teaspoons lime juice
1 teaspoon lime zest
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and ground black pepper
1 (5 ounce) can solid white albacore tuna in water, drained and chunked

1 teaspoon capers, drained (optional)
8 Original Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps®

Directions:
Stir Dijon mustard, lime juice, lime zest, and sugar together in a bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil; whisk until dressing thickens slightly. Stir in the salt and pepper.
Place the tuna in a bowl. Lightly fold in tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, parsley, and capers.
Drizzle dressing over the tuna mixture. Stir gently, trying not to break the tuna into small pieces.
Place a spoonful of tuna onto a pretzel crisp, top with 2 olive slices, and sprinkle with some crumbled feta cheese.
