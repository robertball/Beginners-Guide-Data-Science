Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups chopped fresh asparagus, or more to taste
1 onion, chopped
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
2 tablespoons water
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix asparagus, onion, flour, Parmesan cheese, and parsley together in a bowl.
Whisk 1/2 cup vegetable oil, eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl; pour over asparagus mixture. Stir asparagus mixture until well combined; spread in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the torte comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Love this in the early spring months when asparagus is so readily available. Makes a great side dish. Serve warm or at room temperature.
