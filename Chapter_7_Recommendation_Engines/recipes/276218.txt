Ingredients:
1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
3 tablespoons prepared pesto

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine panko, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Place chicken thighs onto the prepared baking sheet and coat each side with pesto. Press panko mixture onto chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
