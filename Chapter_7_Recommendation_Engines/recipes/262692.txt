Ingredients:
cooking spray
15 Medjool dates
1 1/2 cups unsalted raw cashews
1 cup vanilla Greek yogurt
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon stevia powder
1/3 cup sliced peaches, or to taste
1/3 cup sliced strawberries, or to taste
1/4 cup blueberries, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the bottom of a 9-inch tart pan with cooking spray.
Soak dates in a bowl of warm water until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain; chop dates in half and place in a food processor. Add cashews and pulse until a thick, moist 'dough' is formed and cashews are all broken up. Press dough evenly over the bottom and partly up the sides of the prepared pan to make the crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, about 10 minutes.
Blend yogurt, cream cheese, almond extract, and stevia together in a bowl until smooth. Spread mixture on top of the baked crust. Decorate with peaches, strawberries, and blueberries.
