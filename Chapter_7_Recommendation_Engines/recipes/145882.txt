Ingredients:
2 large eggplants, cut into cubes
salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup whole almonds, skin removed
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved and seeded
4 mint leaves, sliced
2 tablespoons white wine
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place the eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Set the colander in the sink to drain off liquid, about 20 minutes. Pat the cubes with paper towel to remove excess salt.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion in the oil until translucent. Add the garlic; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Stir in the eggplant and almonds, cooking and stirring until the eggplant is tender, but not mushy, about 20 minutes.
When the eggplant is cooked through, mix in the tomatoes, mint, white wine, sugar, salt, and chili powder. Cook mixture for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; remove from heat and garnish with parsley.

Description: 
This eggplant is great served as a side dish or as a complete meal atop bulgur wheat, or couscous. It's a savory and sweet Mediterranean dish. The almonds are a nice source of protein for vegetarians like myself. Enjoy!
