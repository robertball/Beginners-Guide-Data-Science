Ingredients:
1 envelope of active dry yeast
1/4 cup water
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon of salt
1 cup of hot milk
1 egg- lightly beaten
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons of butter for brushing

Directions:
Sprinkle yeast over very water water in a large bowl. Stir until yeast dissolves.
Add sugar, butter and salt to hot milk and stir until the sugar is dissolved and butter is melted.  Cool mixture ot 105 to 115 degrees.
Add milk mixture to yeast, then beat in egg.  Beat in 4 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.  Use some of the remaining flour to dust a pastry cloth.
Knead dough lightly for 5 minutes, working in the remaining flour.
Place dough in a warm oiled bowl, turn and cover and let rise until is has doubled, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.
Punch down dough and knead for 4 to 5 minutes on a lightly floured pastry cloth.  Dough will be sticky, so use a little flour on the mat and hands, otherwise the rolls will not be as light and flakey.
Pinch off small chunks of dough and shape into balls about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches in diameter.  Place in rows on a well greased 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan.  Cover rolls and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Brush tops with melted butter and bake in a 375 degree over for 18 to 20 minutes until browned
