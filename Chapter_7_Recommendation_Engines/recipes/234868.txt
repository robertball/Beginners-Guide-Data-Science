Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter 6 custard cups or ramekins.
Mix eggs, egg yolks, and flour together in a bowl until smooth. Whisk pumpkin puree, half-and-half, milk, sugar, salt, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger into egg mixture until smooth; spoon into prepared custard cups.
Arrange custard cups onto a large baking pan. Pour enough water around the custard cups to fill pan halfway.
Bake in the preheated oven until custards are set in the middle, about 40 minutes. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

Description: 
This is not a particularly sweet dessert, but it is creamy. The recipe calls for cream, but I use half-and-half. Much of the creaminess comes from the pumpkin puree. This is great with coffee, but better with a nice port. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.
