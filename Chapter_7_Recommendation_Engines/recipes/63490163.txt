Description: 
The original recipe was created by Julie Lohre, my fitness coach.  I think it's more of a cake than brownie consistency.  It wasn’t sweet enough for my taste, so I added the Splenda and vanilla, then increased the baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon since Splenda often makes a recipe have trouble rising.
