Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound salmon
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small chunks

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray and place salmon in the middle of the foil.
Whisk maple syrup, Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; brush onto salmon. Sprinkle butter chunks over salmon. Fold aluminum foil over salmon, sealing the edges together.
Cook on the preheated grill until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
