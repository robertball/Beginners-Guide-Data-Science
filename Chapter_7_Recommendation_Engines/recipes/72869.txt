Ingredients:
3 pounds new potatoes, scrubbed and quartered
1/2 cup Italian-style salad dressing
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped green onions
2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the salad dressing, mayonnaise, green onions, dill, mustard, lemon juice, and pepper. When the potatoes are cooled, stir into the bowl until coated. Refrigerate for a couple of hours to blend flavors before serving.

Description: 
A tangy potato salad using Italian dressing and fresh dill.  I love this even though I am not a fan of potato salads.  Can be made using all low-fat or fat-free products. Just as good.
