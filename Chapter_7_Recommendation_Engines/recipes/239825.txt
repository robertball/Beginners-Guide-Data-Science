Ingredients:
1 pound ground lamb, or more to taste
1/2 cup shredded cabbage, or more to taste
1/3 cup diced onion
1 egg
1 1/4 tablespoons ground allspice
1 tablespoon freshly ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground sumac (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Boil lamb in a pot of water, breaking into small chunks with a spoon, until fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Skim fat from water using a spoon and drain water from meat.
Mix cooked lamb, cabbage, onion, egg, allspice, cardamom, turmeric, sumac, salt, and pepper together in bowl; roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through and browned on the outside, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Lamb is usually a pretty fatty meat (with none of the good fats!). So I made up this recipe to satisfy my husband's cravings for lamb. Not only are they fast and easy, they are healthy and freeze well too. I serve this with rice and lentils (in rice cooker) with yogurt.
