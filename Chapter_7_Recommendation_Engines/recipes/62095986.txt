Ingredients:
1 Gallon Whole Milk
1 cup vinegar or lemon juice
Colinder with cheesecloth lined or thin cloth that has been wetted with water.

Directions:
Bring 1 gallon of milk to slow boil.  Watch or it will scald pan.  When at a boil, add either lemon juice or vinegar.  There is only slight taste variation between the 2.  Milk should separate and curddle.  Stir for 1 minute bringing back to boil.  Remove from heat.  Pour into the colinder and allow the watery part to drain away leaving the curds.  Let cool for a moment and when able to pick up, carefully either hang above sink to slow drip out or twist and squeeze out slowly.  When well drained, place between heavy pan & cutting board ( i put my iron skillet on it with a large bowl of water to add to the weight)flattening to about an inch thick.  Leave to flatten and conceal more.  Slice into cubes, lightly fry in oil when ready to put into recipe.
