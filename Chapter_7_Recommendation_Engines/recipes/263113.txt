Ingredients:
2/3 cup almond meal
5 tablespoons butter, melted
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/4 cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®)
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons water
3 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons almond flour
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
Mix almond meal and butter together in a bowl. Spoon into bottoms of the paper liners; press down to form a flat crust.
Stir cream cheese and sweetener together in a bowl just until smooth. Mix in whipping cream and water. Add eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in sour cream, almond flour, and vanilla extract. Spoon into paper liners.
Bake in the preheated oven until cream cheese mixture is almost set in the middle, 15 to 18 minutes. Be careful not to overcook.
Let cool at room temperature; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.

Description: 
This is an adaptation of a popular New York cheesecake recipe that I revised for low-carb diets. The crust is a little off because there's really no perfect substitute for graham cracker, but otherwise it tastes just like my favorite NY cheesecake. Enjoy!
