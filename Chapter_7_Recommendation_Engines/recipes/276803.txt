Ingredients:
Spices:
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons ground turmeric
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon grated ginger, or to taste
4 bay leaves
2 whole star anise pods
2 cardamom pods
1 cinnamon stick
1 kaffir lime leaf
1/8 red chile pepper, sliced
Sauce:
2 (8 ounce) containers plain yogurt (such as NestleÂ®), divided
4 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce (patis), divided
10 chicken leg quarters
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 tablespoon minced onion, or to taste
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
1 cube chicken bouillon
2 cups water
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste
1 (6.5 ounce) can Filipino-style tomato sauce
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Mix ground cinnamon, turmeric, garam masala, paprika, ginger, bay leaves, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon stick, kaffir leaf, and chile pepper together in a bowl.
Mix 1/2 of 1 yogurt container with 2 tablespoons of spice mixture and 1 tablespoon fish sauce in a bowl. Make deep cuts into the chicken thighs to allow sauce to penetrate. Coat chicken with yogurt mixture and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours.
Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Stir-fry onion and garlic in the hot pot for 30 seconds; add remaining spice mixture and continue to stir-fry, 30 seconds more. Add chicken to the pan and fry until spices around chicken have darkened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add marinade and bring to a boil over high heat; continue to boil, covered, for 2 minutes.
Dissolve bouillon in water and add to the pot. Add remaining yogurt, remaining fish sauce, and sugar. Boil chicken in sauce until nearly cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Add tomato sauce; boil until chicken is no longer pink in the centers and sauce has completely thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Melt butter into mixture and cover. Turn off heat and let dish rest to let chicken absorb sauce, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
My version of chicken curry, inspired by Malaysian and Indian curries. I decided to keep this here to save the ingredients for personal purposes, but there's no harm in sharing it to others, so feel free to use.
