Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray
1 (10 ounce) package frozen okra, thawed and sliced
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil, or more as needed
1/2 cup gluten-free flour
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch dried crushed oregano
1 pinch dried crushed thyme
1 pinch chipotle pepper powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Toss okra and grapeseed oil in a large bowl. Mix gluten-free flour, paprika, salt, oregano, thyme, chipotle powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Add flour mixture to okra and mix well to combine. Spread in one layer onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Stir and bake until crisp, 10 to 25 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let stand for a few minutes so that the crispy parts release from the foil.
