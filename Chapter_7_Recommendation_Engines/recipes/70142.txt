Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant, peeled and sliced into 1/2 inch rounds
4 tablespoons mayonnaise, or as needed
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place the bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Coat each slice of eggplant on both sides with mayonnaise. Press into the bread crumbs to coat. Place coated eggplant slices on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Flip slices over, and cook for an additional 20 to 25 minutes to brown the other side.

Description: 
I found that some of the best recipes are the easiest!  Try this once, and more than likely you'll make it again and again.  And another bonus:  if you choose to use low-fat mayonnaise, you'll save the fat and calories that are absorbed when eggplant is fried.
