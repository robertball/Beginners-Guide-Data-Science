Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon anise seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 tablespoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup corn oil
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vinegar
3 tablespoons sesame seeds, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix flour, anise seeds, baking powder, fennel seeds, and baking soda together in a medium bowl.
Whisk oil, sugar, eggs, and vinegar together in a separate bowl. Pour over flour mixture and mix until dough comes together. Divide dough into small pieces and roll into short ropes. Join ends together to form rings.
Arrange cookie rings on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
