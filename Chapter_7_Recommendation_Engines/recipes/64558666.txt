Ingredients:
4 Tbsp of granulated sugar (white or raw cane)
1/2  tsp hot, strong espresso

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk the sugar and hot coffee with a small whisk.
Whip the coffee and the sugar vigorously and continuously until a cream forms and the color becomes a pale, caramel color (this can take up to 5 or 6 minutes).
Put a dollop or two on top of your coffee.
This can be made in advance and kept for a few hours at room temperature. Just give it a bit of a whirl before using.

Description: 
A frothy, foamy coffee - like you get at Italian coffee bars. Sugar is hand whipped with the first drops of coffee out of an Italian moka to get that creamy head like that of an espresso steam press machine.  Try it with either white sugar or raw cane sugar, each has their unique flavour. Read through the instructions of the recipe first to familiarise yourself with the method so you will get the hang of it before starting.
