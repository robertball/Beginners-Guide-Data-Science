Ingredients:
Juice from 3 oranges
Juice from 3 lemons
Juice from 3 limes
Zest from 1 orange
Zest from 1 lemon
Zest from 1 lime
1.5 cups chopped sea scallops
1.5 cups chopped shrimp
1 shallot, peeled and roughly chopped
1 jalapeño, seeded and roughly chopped
One 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and shredded
One 2-inch piece lemongrass, roughly chopped
1 clove minced garlic
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup sesame oil
1/4 cup orange juice
Sriracha to taste (optional)
Salt to taste
3 cups chopped watermelon
2 tablespoons toasted black sesame seeds

Directions:
In a large non-reactive bowl or container, combine the citrus juices and zests. Add the scallops and mix thoroughly. Place in refrigerator to chill for several hours or until shrimp is pink and opaque.
Meanwhile, make a vinaigrette: combine the shallots, jalapeño, ginger, lemongrass, garlic, rice vinegar, orange juice and honey in a food processor or blender and process until smooth. With the motor running, add the oil in a thin, steady stream. If you are using the sriracha, add it now and blend until incorporated. Season with salt to taste.
Once the scallops have marinated, strain and discard the liquid. Place the scallops and watermelon in a bowl and mix gently. Stir in the vinaigrette to taste and season with additional salt as needed. Sprinkle with toasted black sesame seeds and serve at once.
