Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds ground turkey
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon ground ancho chile powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup canned pumpkin
4 cups mashed, seasoned sweet potatoes
1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Cook ground turkey until browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in onion, bell pepper, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, ancho chile powder, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion and peppers have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and pumpkin. Top with mashed sweet potatoes and sprinkle with smoked paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until flavors are well combined and sweet potatoes are browned, about 30 minutes.
