Ingredients:
8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces
3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
1 bay leaf
3/8 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon ginger paste or grated ginger root
1/2 teaspoon fresh black pepper
1-1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch or arrowroot
3 tablespoons chicken stock
Sliced scallions, for garnish
2 cups cooked rice, any type, for serving

Directions:
In a 3- or 4-quart slow cooker (Crockpot), place the chicken pieces, and add the garlic, bay leaf, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, pepper, and brown sugar. Stir to combine, set cooker to HIGH, and cook for 3-1/2 hours (you can also cook on LOW for 7 hours). Stir the cornstarch into the chicken stock, and add this slurry to the slow cooker. (If you have been cooking on LOW, turn the cooker to HIGH.) Stir, and cook for 30 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly and the chicken practically shreds on its own.
Serve over rice, garnished with scallions.
