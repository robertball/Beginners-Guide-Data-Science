Ingredients:
4 eggs
3 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
2 cups pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 1/2 teaspoons celery seed
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon salad seasoning

Directions:
Place the eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove saucepan from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a large bowl, mix the olives, mayonnaise, celery seed, pepper, and salad seasoning. Toss in the eggs and macaroni. Cover, and chill at least 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving.

Description: 
This recipe is better the second day, if there is any left over. My family fights for the leftovers!  You can add more or less olives, celery seed, and mayonnaise to taste. Even better if made the night before and allowed to sit for several hours.
