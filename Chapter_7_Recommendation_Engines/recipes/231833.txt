Ingredients:
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small head cabbage, finely shredded

Directions:
Combine chili powder, thyme, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne pepper, cumin, onion powder, and salt in a bowl.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes; stir shredded cabbage into onion and garlic. Cook and stir cabbage mixture until cabbage starts to soften, about 5 more minutes.
Stir spices into cabbage mixture and cook, stirring often, until spices are evenly mixed in and cabbage is tender, 3 more minutes.

Description: 
I threw this together one night when I was craving a Cajun chicken pasta dish I used to make. I've missed it since going low-carb. This dish was a perfect substitute! Great texture and a very, very mild vegetable flavor. Mostly just Cajun yumminess! Adjust the spices to your taste.
