https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup peanut butter
2 large eggs
2 tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
2 1/2 cups flour
1 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
32 mini Reese’s peanut butter cups, each cut into 4 pieces

Directions:
Mix the ingredients down to the vanilla.  Add soda, salt, and flour.  Fold in chocolate chips.
Using and ice cream scoop, scoop dough (these are big cookies).  Place 6 scoops of dough on ungreased cookie sheet.  Use your hand and slightly flatten each scoop of dough.  Cook for 12 minutes at 350.
Remove cookies from oven and lightly press 8 cut up pieces of the Reese’s peanut butter cups over the top of each cookie.  Return to oven for 2 more minutes.  Cool on baking sheet 2 minutes before placing on cooling rack.  I think these cookies are best eaten warm.  However, the still taste great the next day.  Are best if eaten no later than the day after baking.  Makes 18 cookies.
Variation: use mini or regular M&M pieces in place of the Reese’s pieces.
