1 small zucchini, sliced
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Cut zucchini lengthwise into quarters. Cut quarters into lengths that will fit in a resealable sandwich bag. Add Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, soy sauce, and chicken seasoning.
Let zucchini marinate at room temperature, about 20 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove zucchini from marinade and grill until softened but still firm, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
