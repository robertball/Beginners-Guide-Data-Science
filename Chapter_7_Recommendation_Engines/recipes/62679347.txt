Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
3 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups grated zucchini (about 3 zucchinis)
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Grease and flour two 8 x 4 inch pans.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Sift flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Beat eggs, applesauce, oil, vanilla, and sugar together in a large bowl.  Add sifted ingredients to the creamed mixture, and beat well.  Stir in zucchini and nuts until well combined.  Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake for 40 to 60 minutes, or until tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool in pan on rack for 20 minutes.  Remove bread from pan, and completely cool. (If using Bread and Muffin Crumb Topping, sprinkle topping on top of bread after baking for 20 minutes.)
