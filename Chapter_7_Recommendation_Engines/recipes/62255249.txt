Ingredients:
Starting Group
•2 tablespoons vegetable oil
•3 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut in 1-inch cubes
•1 cup onion, chopped
•4 serrano chili peppers, chopped
•3 cloves garlic, minced
Group 2
•3 cups beef broth (can use 1 cup broth and 1 bottle beer, if desired)
•1 cup tomato puree
•1 large tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped
•2 chipotle chili peppers, in adobo sauce
•1 teaspoon adobo sauce
Group 3
•1 teaspoon kosher salt
•1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
•1 teaspoon ground cayenne
•2 teaspoons aleppo pepper flake
•10 pequin chili peppers, crushed
•1 teaspoon smoked paprika
•2-4 dried ghost chili peppers (naga jolokia), depending on size, cut into small pieces
•1/4 cup chili powder, or more to taste**
•1/2 to 1 tablespoon ground cumin, depending on taste***
•2 tablespoons corn meal

Directions:
Combine all Group 2 ingredients and set aside. Combine all Group 3 ingredients and set aside. Combine onion, and serrano peppers and set aside.
In a large pot, over med-high heat, sear the beef in the oil until browned. Once browned, remove the beef and set aside. Add the onions, and serranos to the pot and sauté until soft (about 6 minutes). Vapors from the peppers cooking may irritate the eyes, so you may need to crack a window. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute (don’t burn the garlic!). Return the beef to the pot.
Add Group 2 to the pot and stir. Add the Group 3 to the pot, stir, and reduce the heat to low and simmer at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally. If the chili gets too thick, add water to thin. If you prefer a thicker chili, let simmer uncovered until desired thickness. Add additional salt to taste if needed.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite chili recipes, but is not for people who can't handle a lot of heat. If you like a spicy, flavorful, and hearty chili, then this is the recipe for you. Don't be scared by the use of ghost chili peppers-- the overall heat level is reduced as it simmers, leaving a hot, but manageable chili. Also, the aleppo pepper makes a great addition-- it has a natural smokiness to it and has a cumin like flavor. The ghost chilies also have a natural smoke like flavor, and are perfect for making a spicy chili. Enjoy!
