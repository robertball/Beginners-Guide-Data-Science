Ingredients:
1/3 cup tahini (sesame paste)
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tbs chopped fresh parsley
2 garlic cloves, crushed
Salt & freshly ground black pepper
6 cups vegetable oil, to fry
1 head cauliflower, cut into medium florets

Directions:
To make the tahini sauce, place the tahini, lemon juice, water, parsley and garlic in a medium bowl and stir until smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Set aside until serving.
Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on medium-high heat.
Add about half the cauliflower to the hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, for about 8 minutes or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Repeat with remaining cauliflower. Place the fried cauliflower on a serving plate. Add tahini to individual bowls for each person to drizzle. Serve immediately.
