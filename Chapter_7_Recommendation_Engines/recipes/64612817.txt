Ingredients:
1 Ziploc bag
4 Tablespoons oyster-flavored sauce
2 tsp seasame oil
2 tsp white vinegar
1 tsp "Better than Bullion"
2 tsp cornstarch
1 pound beef steak, cut into 1/8-inch thick strips
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp ground ginger
3 cloves garlic slivered or minced

Directions:
In a Ziploc bag, add the oyster-flavored sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, better than bullion and cornstarch. Close the bag and toss until the bullion has dissolved. Place the steak pieces into the bag and close the bag again. Toss the bag to coat well, and marinate for at least 30 minutes in refrigerator.
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the broccoli, garlic powder, ground ginger and garlic slivers and turn heat down to low. Cook covered until broccoli is bright green and almost tender, 12-15 minutes. Remove the broccoli from the skillet and set aside.
Pour a little more oil into the skillet, if needed, and stir and toss the beef with the marinade until the sauce forms a glaze on the beef, and the meat is no longer pink, about 7-8 minutes.
Pour the cooked meat mixture through a strainer to get rid of any excess oil.
Add the meat mixture to the cooked broccoli and serve.
Meal cost: $8.75 (minus the spices, oils and sauces which were already in my pantry)
