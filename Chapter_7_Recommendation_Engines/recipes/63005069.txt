Ingredients:
8 large McIntosh apples - peeled, cored and cut into slices.
6 tablespoons corn  starch
1 1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
Topping for a 9x12 pan:
1 C. butter
1 C. sugar
1 C. brown sugar
1 C. flour
1 C. Old Fashioned, NOT Instant oatmeal

Directions:
Place the apples into a large mixing bowl.
Stir the corn  starch, 1 1/2 cup sugar,and cinnamon, together in a bowl.
Pile half the apples into the pan sprayed with Pam, and dot with half of the butter. Sprinkle half of the corn starch-cinnamon sugar mixture over the apples. Pile the remaining apples into the pan. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar mixture.
Make the topping by mixing the butter, sugars, flour, and Old Fashioned oatmeal together until it resembles pea sized bits.  Sprinkle on top of apples.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until the crust is golden brown, about 60 minutes. (Mine took l hour and 15 minutes) Check half way through the baking time, and cover the edges with aluminum foil for the last 30 minutes if necessary to prevent over-browning.
Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
