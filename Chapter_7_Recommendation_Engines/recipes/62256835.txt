Ingredients:
Foot soaking tub or basin
Foot soaking tablets or liquids for moisturizing, deodorizing, and softening (or a tablespoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of bath oil)
Sea salt
Dry towel
Skin file, pumice stone and/or sloughing cream
Foot cream formula
Toe nail clippers, nail file or emery board
Cuticle stick
Base coat polish, nail polish and clear coat polish
Nail dryer

Directions:
Fill a basin with warm water; add foot soaking tablets or liquids for moisturizing, deodorizing, and softening (or a tablespoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of bath oil).  Soak feet twenty minutes; discard water.
Fill a basin with warm water; add sea salt to further loosen dead skin cells. Soak; discard water and pat feet dry with a towel.
Using a skin file, pumice stone and/or sloughing cream, remove dead skin cells - focus on heels and balls of feet.
For deep moisturizing, apply a cream formula to feet.
Clean under toe nail tips and clip; file splits or rough edges.
Using a cuticle stick, push the skin back gently. Do not force cuticles as this may cause injury or bleeding.
Apply a fortifying base coat and top with polish color of choice.  Air dry or use nail dryer (not a blow dryer).  Apply clear protective coat and allow to dry.
Now you are ready to sport your new pedicure by wearing your favorite pair of sandals.

Description: 
There is nothing like a little attention to one's feet after a long hard day. A pedicure is just the treatment working feet deserve. If you do not feel that you can afford to have a professional pedicure in a nail salon, treat yourself to one at home.
