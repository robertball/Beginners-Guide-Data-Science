Ingredients:
2 cups melted butter
3 cups granulated sugar
2 oz. lemon extract
6 eggs
4 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 c. chopped walnuts
zest of 3 lemons (quantity can be approximate)
Glaze:
1 1/2 cups sugar
juice of 3 medium lemons (quantity can be approximate)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
Grease (or spray with non-stick spray) 8 small or 3 standard loaf pans.
Blend Butter, sugar, eggs and extract.
Add flour, salt and baking powder. Mix well.
Add milk, nuts and lemon zest.
Pour into prepared pans.
Bake at 350° 1 hour for large loaves, 45 - 50 min for small.
While bread is baking make glaze: cook and stir juice and sugar until sugar is dissolved.
Pour glaze over top of warm loaves; use pastry brush to spread evenly.  It will seem like you have too much glaze, but let it soak in and use it all -- the glaze makes it delicious!  Allow to cool completely, then remove from pans and wrap for storage and gifting.

Description: 
This is the one treat I never fail to make at Christmas time.  The recipe makes 8 small loaves, and I usually make two or sometimes three batches for gifting. It's a nice change, and the tartness makes one think it's not too sweet (but it really is :))  Makes eight small or three standard loaves.
