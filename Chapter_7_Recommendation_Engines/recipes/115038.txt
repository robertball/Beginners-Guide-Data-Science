Ingredients:
1 cup distilled white vinegar
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 bay leaves
1 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
2 1/2 pounds lean pork, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 pound small green beans, trimmed (optional)

Directions:
Stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, garlic, and bay leaves in a large saucepan. Add the cubed pork, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the pork is tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally. If using the green beans, add them during the last half hour of cooking.
