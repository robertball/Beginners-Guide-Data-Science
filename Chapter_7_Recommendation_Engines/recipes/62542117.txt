Ingredients:
2 lbs ground beef
1 lb ground pork
1 medium onion finely chopped
5 stalks of celery finely chopped
1/2 box of Bell's seasoning
2 tsp celery salt
2 tsp Old Bay seasoning
2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 bag Pepperidge Farms blue label stuffing

Directions:
Add the meat to a large pot breaking it up with your hands. Add the onion and celery and cover with cold water.
Add Bell's seasoning, celery salt, Old Bay, salt and pepper.  Stir to combine.
Bring to a low boil and cook for about an hour.
When meat is cooked through remove most of the cooking liquid with a ladel and reserve.  It is always best to take out more liquid than you think you should because you can always add it back.
Add your bread stuffing to the meat mixture and stir to combine.  Check your seasoning and add more if needed.
Let sit for 5 minutes.  If your stuffing is too dry add back some of your reserved cooking liquid until it is the consistency you want it.
If you are making this in advance, you can put your stuffing into a large casserole dish and put in the fridge. Reheat it in casserole dish covered with foil at 350 until warmed through.
