Ingredients:
1 cup chopped pitted dates
1 cup chopped dried figs
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup boiling water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
2 eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch baking pan.
In a medium bowl, combine the dates, figs, butter and baking soda. Pour in the boiling water, stir well and let stand for 15 minutes.
Beat the sugar, walnuts and eggs into the date mixture. Combine the  all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the date mixture just until blended. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I like to have this sweet, dark and hearty bread for breakfast or with afternoon coffee or tea. Try it thinly sliced and topped with cream cheese and a scattering of chopped dates.
