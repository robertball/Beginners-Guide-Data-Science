1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup walnuts
1 (15.25 ounce) can pears in light syrup, drained reserving syrup
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
3 tablespoons fat-free vanilla yogurt
2 tablespoons honey
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine sugar, cinnamon and walnuts in a skillet over medium heat.  Mix together until sugar and cinnamon are melted and walnuts are evenly coated. Remove from heat.  Spread walnuts on a large plate to cool.
In the container of a blender, combine the drained pears, 1/3 cup of the reserved syrup from the can, vinegar, yogurt, honey, salt, pepper, vanilla extract, and nutmeg; blend until smooth.
Assemble the salad by tossing together the mixed greens, spinach, pear slices, dried cherries, feta cheese, and walnuts in a serving bowl. Serve with dressing on the side.

Description: 
A mix of juicy pears, sweetened nuts, dried cherries, and feta cheese makes this is a show-stopping sweet salad! The taste and colors will impress!  You may add more of the pear syrup to the dressing to make it thinner, or increase the amount of yogurt for creamier results.
