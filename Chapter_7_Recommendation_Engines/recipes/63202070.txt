a pinch of roasted Saigon cinnamon

Directions:
Over medium heat saute the chopped onion and 1/2 tbs canola oil. Add the minced garlic just as the onions begin to caramelize and saute for another minute.
Add the onion and garlic to the pot (I use a rice cooker) along with the rest of the ingredients and cook according to the instructions on the package of your rice or your rice cooker.
