Ingredients:
Aioli:
1 lime, juiced
1 cup roasted red pepper oil, divided
1/3 cup blue cheese salad dressing
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
Slaw:
1/2 (16 ounce) package coleslaw mix
1 lime, juiced
1/2 medium white onion, diced
1 roasted red pepper, chopped
Fish:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
4 cloves garlic, sliced
4 (3 ounce) fillets tilapia, cut into cubes
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon sour cream
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1 (12 ounce) package soft corn tortillas

Directions:
Whisk juice of 1 lime, 2 tablespoons red pepper oil, blue cheese dressing, mayonnaise, sour cream, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon dill in a bowl until combined. Cover and place aioli sauce in freezer until ready to serve.
Place coleslaw mix in a medium bowl. Add juice of 1 lime, 1/2 cup red pepper oil, onion, and chopped roasted red pepper. Toss together until slaw is thoroughly mixed.
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic; cook until slightly browned, about 1 minute. Add tilapia; saute until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add juice of 1 lime, sour cream, cayenne pepper, Cajun seasoning, and dill. Cook and stir until tilapia is browned, about 4 minutes more. Reduce heat to low.
Heat the remaining vegetable oil in a smaller skillet over medium heat. Add tortillas 1 at a time. Cook until bubbles form and tortillas are lightly browned, about 1 minute per side.
Place a portion of the tilapia on each tortilla. Top with coleslaw mixture and chilled aioli sauce.
