Ingredients:
7 slices bacon
2 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of celery soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cheese soup
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch ground paprika, or to taste (optional)
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup butter
7 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup frozen vegetables, or more to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop.
Pour celery soup and cheese soup into a slow cooker set to Low. Season with sea salt, pepper, oregano, garlic salt, garlic powder, and paprika. Stir in chicken broth, water, and butter.
Place potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high until slightly softened, 7 to 8 minutes.
Stir potatoes into the slow cooker. Add bacon and frozen vegetables.
Cook on Low, stirring every hour, until potatoes are soft, 4 to 5 hours.

Description: 
I have been searching for a gluten-free potato soup recipe for a long time. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of options. I tweaked a few recipes that I found lying around. Serve with sour cream, chives, and shredded cheese if desired.
