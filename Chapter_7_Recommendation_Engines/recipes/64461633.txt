Description: 
I love this recipe. I do not eat added sugars, but I love blueberry muffins. I could not find a recipe out there that didn't have added sugars or sugar substitutes. I have tried many different combinations for sugar-free blueberry muffins and this one is the best! The lemon peel blends the flavors together.
