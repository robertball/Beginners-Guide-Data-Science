Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons self-rising flour
1/4 cup chile powder
10 ounces can tomato sauce
2/3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 packet or 1 cube beef bouillon, crumbled
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in flour and chili powder, reduce heat to medium, and cook until lightly brown, stirring constantly to prevent burning flour.
Gradually stir in tomato sauce, water, cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder, and beef bouillon into the flour and chili powder until smooth, and continue cooking over medium heat approximately 10 minutes (or up to 30 minutes for thicker sauce), or until thickened slightly. Season to taste with salt
