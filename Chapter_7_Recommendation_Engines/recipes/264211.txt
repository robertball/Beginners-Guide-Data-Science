Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
4 eggs
1/4 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine almond flour and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix in Cheddar cheese by hand. Create a small well in the middle of the bowl; add eggs and half-and-half to the center. Use a large fork, spoon, or your hands to blend in the flour mixture until a sticky batter forms.
Drop 9 portions of batter onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.
