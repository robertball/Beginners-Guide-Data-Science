Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
4 potatoes, cubed
1 cup medium salsa
2 cups water
1 teaspoon ground cumin
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Cook ground beef and onion until done.
In a large pan add beef, onion, tomatoes, beans, corn, potatoes, picante sauce, water, cumin, salt and pepper to taste, and garlic powder. Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes. I like to use slow cooker and let it simmer all day. Serve; top with cheese.
