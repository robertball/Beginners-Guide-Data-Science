Description: 
These cookies were the treat we would enjoy when we traveled on family shopping trips to Ft. Worth many years ago. My sister, Carrie, always made them and put them in a foil-covered shoe box. By the time we got to Ft. Worth, they were all gone! Now my daughter makes these cookies for me, and at the age of 90, I still think they are the greatest treat.
