Ingredients:
1 c Wheat Chex (or other whole grain cereal)
1 c Honey Nut Cheerios (or other whole grain cereal)
1/3 c wheat flour (or substitute all purpose flour)
1/3 c all purpose flour (or substitute wheat flour)
1/3 c Wheat Germ
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
1 large egg
1/2 c brown sugar
1/4 c canola oil
2 Tbsp vanilla extract
3/4 c fat-free Greek yogurt
Optional -
1/2 c peanut butter
1/2 c quick oats

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Crush the cereal.
3. Mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl.
4. Mix all wet ingredients in a separate bowl.
5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix just until no dry ingredients remain dry.
6. Drop by large spoonful onto baking sheet.  You can form them into 1 1/2 inch bowls and then flatten slightly, but that's optional.  These do not flatten out and do not spread, so you can keep them fairly close together.
7. Bake for 14-16 minutes until crisp and slightly golden.

Description: 
As yummy as they sound, but healthy too!  My 2 year old and 6 year old both love these as much as I do.  Just two will fill me up until lunch time.
