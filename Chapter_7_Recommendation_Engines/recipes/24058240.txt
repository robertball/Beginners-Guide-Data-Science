Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef or turkey
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 green bell peppers, one diced, one sliced in thin rings
1.5 cups cooked wild rice mix
1.5 cups cooked quinoa
1 cup cooked black beans
2 4oz cans sliced black olives
1.5 lbs shredded mozzarella
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp cumin
1 tsp cayenne (or to taste)
1 tsp paprika (or to taste)
1 6oz can tomato paste
1 12oz can tomato juice
1 can diced fire roasted tomatoes, with juice.
2 tbsp cooking oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
In a large skillet, saute diced onions and diced bell peppers in oil with a little salt and pepper until onions are translucent. Add beef and brown. Drain fat and return to burner.
Add tomato paste, tomato juice, tomatoes, olives and all spices. Mix well. Simmer AT LEAST 15 minutes. I do it for 45 minutes to meld flavor and thicken sauce to my personal preference.
Mix the beans, rice and quinoa in with the meat mixture.
In a 9x13 casserole dish, begin layering, starting with meat/rice mixture on the bottom, then cheese, then meat, ending with cheese on top.
Arrange bell pepper rings on top of the casserole.  I like to add slices of tomato, jalapeno and olives to the top as well.
Bake until cheese is melted and golden and the topping veggies cooked (about 15 minutes). You can turn up the heat by adding chopped jalapenos or other chiles to the onions and bells when sauteeing.
