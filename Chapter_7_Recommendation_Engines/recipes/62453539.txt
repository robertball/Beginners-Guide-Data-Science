Ingredients:
1/2 gallon milk
4 oz Greek yogurt or 6 oz regular plain yogurt
2 tablespoons non fat dry milk

Directions:
1.  Pour the entire half gallon of milk into the slow cooker, cover, and turn to low.  I use skim milk but if you prefer a heartier snack opt for a milk with a higher fat content.  Cook for 2 1/2 hrs.
2.  After the time has expired, unplug the slow cooker and allow to sit for 3 hrs.
3.  After this time period, open the crock pot and take out 2 cups of milk and pour into a separate container.
4.  Add the yogurt to the 2 cups of milk and gently stir until it has dissolved.
5.  Add the dry milk. Stir until it is dissolved.
6.  Add this mixture back to the crock pot
7.  Place a thick towel over the crock pot, place in your oven, turn on the light in your oven, and let it sit 8 hrs.  If you have a new and fancy crock pot that holds heat better you can cover with a thick towel and leave it on your counter for about 6 hrs.
8.  Afterwards just store in the fridge!  Reserve 4-6 oz of your batch so you don't have to purchase yogurt when you make yogurt again.
