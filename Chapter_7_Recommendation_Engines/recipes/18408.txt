Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
2 eggplants, quartered and cut into 1/2 inch strips
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup unsweetened coconut cream
2 cups seasoned tomato sauce
1 tablespoon miso paste
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 dash sesame oil

Directions:
Peel some, but not all, skin from eggplant. Place eggplant in a shallow dish and cover with soy sauce. Allow to marinate for 1 hour, turning eggplant occasionally.
In a medium saucepan, mix together coconut cream, tomato sauce, miso paste, and lime juice. Place over low heat and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally. When sauce comes to a boil, remove from heat and cover with lid.
Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok over high heat. Fry eggplant filets a few at a time, until golden brown on both sides. You may need to replenish oil between batches. Serve eggplant over rice or noodles, with sauce spooned over top.

Description: 
An invigorating, Asian influenced dish. Serve eggplant on a bed of Asian green bean vermicelli, or rice, and top with sauce. Excellently complimented by a chilled, dry white wine. This is a recipe I created recently. It is a work in progress, so I would welcome feedback.
