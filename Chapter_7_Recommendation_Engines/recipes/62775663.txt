SHORTBREAD:
Mix flour, butter and sugar with a fork until well blended. Stir in nuts until stiff dough forms. Divide dough in half and shape each into a ball. Pat ball into a 6-inch round about 1/2-inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 8-16 wedges. Bake at 350 for 15 mins. or until golden brown. Set on a wire cooling rack and cool for 2 mins.
