Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken thighs (skin & bones included)
5 chicken bouillon cubes
1 tablespoon Hawaiian sea salt (regular salt is ok too)
1 (1/2 inch piece or 1-1/2 Tbs) minced fresh ginger root
1 large Maui sweet onion, finely chopped
1 (8 ounce) package long rice noodles, aka bean threads (Saifun brand is good)
3 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Place chicken in large saucepan, add 2 quarts of the water (w/o bouillon), the salt and ginger. Bring to a boil over high heat, skim, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken is tender and no longer pink, about 35-40 minutes. Remove chicken saving the broth, and skim solids from broth. Discard the solids.
Shread meat & set aside, discarding the skin & bones. Put broth, onion, bouillon cubes and the remaining one quart of water into saucepan & bring to a boil. Add the long rice, then lower heat & cook covered for 5 minutes.  Turn off heat & let sit for 30 minutes.
After the noodles have sat for 30 minutes, stir in the chicken and heat briefly, if desired.  Sprinkle with green onions before serving. Makes 6-8 servings.
