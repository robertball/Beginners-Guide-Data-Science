Ingredients:
3 large sweet potatoes
1/2 cup chopped Vidalia onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine
1/4 cup red wine
1 tablespoon brandy
2 cubes chicken bouillon
2 cups water
1/2 tablespoon allspice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add sweet potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel, and mash. Set aside.
In a medium skillet over medium high heat, cook and stir onions in olive oil until translucent. Add white wine, red wine, and brandy, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add mashed sweet potatoes, stirring to incorporate. Dissolve bouillon cubes in water and add to the soup with the allspice. Simmer another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

Description: 
A fantastic soup for a chilly fall evening. The scent of brandy and allspice will permeate throughout your home. You can puree the soup if you like, although I prefer to leave it chunky.
