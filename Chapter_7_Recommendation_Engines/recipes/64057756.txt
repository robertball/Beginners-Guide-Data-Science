Ingredients:
1 liter dandelion blossoms
1 liter water
1 lemon
1 kg sugar

Directions:
pick blossoms on a dry day before or around noon (when they are open widest)- not close to a street. Rinse shortly in cold water or spread out on kitchen towel or paper so the crawly things get out.
In a large pot combine the blossoms, cold water and sliced lemon and boil for 15 minutes. Let cool and sit covered for 24 to 48 hours.
Strain through a very fine sieve or linen cloth trying to squeeze as much juices out as possible.
Add sugar to this juice and simmer to a syrupy consistency stirring often. This will take anything from 45 minutes to 3 hours. The "honey" will also get a more syrupy consistence after it cools. Do not boil vigorously or you might get hard candy after it cooled down!
Fill in jars while still hot, screw on lids and turn upside down for about 5 min - this seals the jars like bought ones so they will actually "plop" when you open them (i do that with all homemade preserve jars).
