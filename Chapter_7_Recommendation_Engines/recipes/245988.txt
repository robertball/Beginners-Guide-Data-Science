Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups kefir
2 eggs
4 ounces chocolate chips, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add kefir and eggs; stir until batter is moist but still lumpy. Fold in chocolate chips.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I don't always make pancakes, but when I do, I prefer kefir chocolate chip pancakes. I love traditional pancakes, but kefir gives these an extra dimension of fullness. When making these pancakes, I also highly recommend experimenting with various flavored kefirs, such as strawberry or pomegranate. I don't think of pancakes as healthy in general, but this recipe calls for only 2 teaspoons of sugar. If you include chocolate chips, you don't even need to use maple syrup. Enjoy some orange juice or a coffee with these.
