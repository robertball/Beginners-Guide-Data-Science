Ingredients:
1 (5.5 ounce) package dry risotto mix
4 ounces goat cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Prepare risotto according to package directions. Chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour, until cooled.
Roll risotto into 2 inch mounds. Place a marble-sized chunk of goat cheese on each mound. Press cheese chunks into mounds, then roll mounds around cheese, creating balls.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil and cook the risotto balls, turning occasionally, until evenly golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
