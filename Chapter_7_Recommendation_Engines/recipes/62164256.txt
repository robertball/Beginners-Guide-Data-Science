Ingredients:
1 Boneless New York Strip Loin Grilling Steak (Approx. 0.330 kg)
2 shallots
2 cloves of garlic cloves
2 teaspoons of Club House La Grill Montreal Steak Seasoning
2 tablespoons of Red wine
6 drops Lea & Perrins Worchester sauce
1 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil for cooking
2 teaspoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil for marinating

Directions:
To prepare marinade:
Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning on each side of the steak
Rub seasoning into meat
Drizzle 1 teaspoon Olive Oil on each side of steak
Add 1 shallot (thinly sliced) and 1 garlic clove (thinly sliced)
Add 1 tablespoon of red wine on each side of steak
Add 3 drops of Lea & Perrins Worchester sauce on each side of steak
Then, refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours
Cut remaining shallots and garlic into thin slices and set aside in a bowl for use later
Cook steak:
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on low-medium heat in frying pan
Add shallots and garlic previously set aside into pan (1 to 2 mins)
Take out marinated steak from refrigerator and take off any shallots and garlic stuck to the steak
Then, turn up stove heat to medium-high setting
Once heated up, add steak to frying pan (without any left over marinating sauces, shallots or garlic)
Cook each side of steak for 3Â½ to 4 minutes for medium-rare
Once ready, immediately remove from the stove and the frying pan onto a plate to ensure steak does not get over cooked.
Serve immediately and enjoy!
