Ingredients:
2 pounds baby potatoes
1 pint halved grape tomatoes
2 tbsp chopped chives
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup light Ranch salad dressing
1/2 cup light cucumber salad dressing
1/2 to 1 tsp dill weed
1/2 tsp garlic salt
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Boil the potatoes until they come apart easily when a fork is insterted into them.  Leave the skins on, it lends a nice flavour. Drain the potatoes.
Cool the potatoes 10 to 15 minutes in the pot. Then stir in the tomatoes, celery, and chives.
Mix the two salad dressings together, then stir in spices.  Toss the potato mixture in the salad dressing mix.
This is excellent served hot, but can also be served chilled.

Description: 
Like the name says, this is a hot potato salad made without mayo, so it's a definite healthy choice!  People are often wary of the use of salad dressing in this, but I have not found anyone who doesn't like this!
