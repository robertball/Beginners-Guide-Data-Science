Cranberry Wheat Bread Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup water
4 TBSP honey
2 TBSP softened butter or marg.
2 1/2 cups bread flour (unbleached)
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp ground mace (if desired; can use cinnamon)
2 3/4 tsp yeast
Mix-in (optional): 2/3 cup cranberries (I often use frozen ones)

Directions:
Place liquid ingredients in the bread pan
Add dry ingredients
Place yeast on top of dry ingredients
Place in breadmaker and select "Sweet" setting or "Dough" if you want to bake in the oven
For oven baked, I usually use 2 loaf pans. Divide dough, roll out rectangles, roll up rectangles, pinch ends and place in sprayed pans. Let rise (usually takes 30 to 50 minutes depending on how warm it is). Bake at 350 (breads with honey need a lower temp.) for about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a good, reliable bread recipe. It is from the book that came with my bread machine. Make it with or without cranberries. I usually make the dough in the machine and then bake in the oven.
