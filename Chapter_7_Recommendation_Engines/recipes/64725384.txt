Ingredients:
1.5 lbs of chicken drumsticks (5-6 drumsticks)
2 lemons
6 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons of oregano (Greek oregano preferred)
2 teaspoons of kosher salt
2 teaspoons of fresh ground pepper
1 teaspoon of garlic salt
1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon of onion powder
1/2 teaspoon of dried basil
1/2 cup of olive oil
1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar

Directions:
Rinse and pay dry drumsticks and prepare ingredients for marinade.
Zest and juice both lemons, chop garlic cloves.
Mix all spices, lemon zest, juice and garlic with red wine vinegar and olive oil.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees (Farenheit).
Marinade chicken in a ziploc for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Once marinade is complete, heat a cast iron skillet on medium high to sear the chicken before baking.
Grease the pan and brown the drumsticks for 3-4 minutes in each side, until brown and crispy. Reserve the extra marinade from the ziploc bag.
Once chicken is browned on all sides, place chicken in baking dish or sheet and spoon the remaining marinade on top of the chicken.
Bake chicken at 325 for 30 minutes, or until the chicken has an internal temp of 165.
For extra crispiness, once the chicken has reached the correct temp, broil the chicken for 1-2 minutes before serving.
Serve immediately and spoon the extra pan sauce over the chicken before serving.
Side suggestions: Tomato, Cucumber and Feta Salad or Orzo Pasta Salad
