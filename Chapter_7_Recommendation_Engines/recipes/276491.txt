Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed
3 tablespoons butter
2 cups finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 pinch salt and ground white pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 (16 ounce) tube polenta, cut into 1/8-inch slices

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with 1 teaspoon butter. Add 2 teaspoons Parmesan cheese to the baking pan and shake gently, back and forth, until the bottom and sides are coated with Parmesan, discarding any extra.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add flour and stir until well combined. Turn off heat and whisk in milk. Turn heat to medium-low and bring sauce to a simmer; cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
While sauce is thickening, mix together Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs in a bowl.
Layer 1/2 of the polenta slices in the prepared baking dish and top with 1/2 of the sauce. Repeat with remaining polenta and sauce. Top with cheese mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, about 25 minutes.
