Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) container select oysters, undrained
1 cup chopped green onions
1 cup evaporated skim milk
2/3 cup diced tasso
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
6 cups hot cooked angel hair (about 3/4 pound uncooked pasta)
Basil sprigs (optional)

Directions:
Drain oysters, reserving 1/3 cup juice, and set both aside.
Combine chopped green onions, skim milk, diced tasso, and garlic in a medium saucepan, and cook milk mixture over medium-low heat 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Place flour in a small bowl. Add reserved oyster juice, stirring with a whisk until blended, and add to milk mixture. Cook oyster juice mixture over medium heat 4 minutes or until thick, stirring constantly. Add oysters, chopped parsley, and Cajun-Creole Seasoning; cook 4 minutes or until edges of oysters curl. Combine oyster mixture and pasta in a large bowl; toss well. Garnish with basil sprigs, if desired.

Description: 
We guar-on-tee this Louisiana-style seafood pasta packs a spicy punch. Tasso is a Cajun specialty: smoked pork shoulder that's highly seasoned. If you can't find it, substitute smoked pork chops.
