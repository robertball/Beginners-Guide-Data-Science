Ingredients:
2 cups plus 2 tablespoons of unbleached all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of salt
12 tablespoons (or 1 and 1/2 sticks) of butter, melted and cooled until warm
1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar
1/2 of a cup granulated sugar
1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
1- 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Adjust the oven racks to the upper and lower middle positions and preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or spray them with nonstick cooking spray.
Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside.
Either by hand or with an electric mixer mix the butter and sugars until thoroughly blended. Beat in the egg, yolk, and vanilla until mixed in well. Slowly add the dry ingredients and beat at low speed.
Add chocolate chips. Roll 1/4 of a cup of dough, and shape into whichever shape of cookie you like best. Place on baking sheets 2 and 1/2 inches apart.
Bake until cookies are light golden brown, about 15 to 18 minutes. Rotate the sheets about halfway from bottom to top. Cool the cookies and then enjoy!
