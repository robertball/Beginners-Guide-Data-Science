1 cup raw buckwheat
1 cup hemp seed hearts
1 cup slivered almonds
1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes

1/2 cup cacao nibs
1 1/2 cups almond butter

Directions:
Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Combine buckwheat, hemp seed hearts, almonds, coconut flakes, chia seeds, and cacao nibs in a large bowl.
Mix 1 1/2 cup almond butter, sugar, honey, and salt together in a large saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Pour in buckwheat mixture; stir until completely coated. Press mixture into the prepared pan.
Place chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon almond butter in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until melted, about 5 minutes. Spread melted chocolate over the mixture in the pan with a spatula.
