Ingredients:
2 pounds purple, orange, yellow, and/or white sweet potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick wedges
3 tablespoons olive oil
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Pinch salt
½ cup mayonnaise
1 Tablespoon milk
1 ½ teaspoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon snipped fresh dill
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F. Line two 15x10x1-inch baking pans with foil.
In a very large bowl combine the sweet potatoes, olive oil, ½ tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Toss to coat. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking pans. Bake about 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender and starting to brown, rotating the pans once halfway through baking.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl whisk together ½ cup mayonnaise, the lemon zest, lemon juice, 1 tsp. pepper, and a pinch salt.
In a separate small bowl whisk together ½ cup mayonnaise, the milk, horseradish, dill and 1/8 tsp. pepper.
Serve sweet potatoes warm or at room temperature with the two sauces for dipping.
