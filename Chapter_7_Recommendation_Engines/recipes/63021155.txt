Ingredients:
5 apples - peeled, cored and diced
4 oranges, peeled and diced
1 cup of fresh cranberries
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup coarsely crushed buttery round crackers
1/2 cup butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup liquid non-dairy creamer

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, toss together the apples, oranges, cranberries, brown sugar, Cheddar cheese, and walnuts. Spread evenly in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle crushed crackers evenly over the fruit.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk in flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and baking powder. Drizzle over the crackers, then drizzle the creamer over the casserole. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and uncover. Stir gently to fold in the crust.

Description: 
I had oranges and apples This is a great side-dish for a holiday gathering or would even be good as a dessert over French vanilla ice cream -- or even better if you cook this the night before and heat it up before serving. Enjoy!Modified from: Larra's Baked Spiced Apples and Oranges
