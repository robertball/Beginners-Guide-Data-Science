Ingredients:
6 1/2 cups water, divided
1 cup red quinoa
1 cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
1 cup farro
1 cucumber, seeded and chopped
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 orange bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 yellow squash, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (6 ounce) container crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring 2 cups water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Bring 1 1/2 cup water and couscous to a boil in a separate saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until couscous is tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.
Bring 3 cups water and farro to a boil in a separate saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until farro is tender and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Combine quinoa, couscous, farro, cucumber, red onion, orange bell pepper, and yellow squash together in a bowl.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, and salt together in a bowl. Pour dressing over grain-vegetable mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle feta cheese over salad. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.
