Ingredients:
1 cp rice
1 large chicken thigh w/leg
1/2 cp green bell peppers
1/2 cp of the light green bell peppers
1/4 c red bell peppers
1/2 c scallions
1/4 c celery
1 c of baby peas in the pods
1 c of thinly sliced zuchinni
2 tb curry
1 tb paprika
1 ts red pepper
1 ts poultry seasoning
1 tb parsley

Directions:
Put all ingredients in a crock pot (I have the crock). If you like your rice long and supple then put this in after it's been cooking for 3 hrs. Please use your own judgement as to heat. As it is currently it's zesty, if you want it hotter please feel free to add more. This will cook for 4 hrs on HI. (remove the chicken skin after the chicken is cooked & the bones); set the heat on LO to keep from over cooking the chicken after that.
