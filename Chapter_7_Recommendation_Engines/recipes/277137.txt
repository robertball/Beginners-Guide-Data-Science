Ingredients:
1 (8.8 ounce) package fresh pesto-filled tortellini (such as AmoreÂ®)
1/2 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
1 cup broccoli florets
2 tablespoons chopped, drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain.
While the tortellini is cooking, combine Alfredo sauce, broccoli, and sun-dried tomatoes in a covered saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is tender-crisp, about 6 minutes.
Serve cooked tortellini with Alfredo sauce spooned over the top. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and season with pepper.
