Ingredients:
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 cups pumpkin puree
3/4 cup cane sugar
2 eggs
2 tablespoons molasses
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (9 inch) prepared chocolate cookie crumb crust

Directions:
Place a double layer of cheesecloth in a strainer over a bowl, making sure there is enough space below the strainer to contain any dripping liquid. Pour Greek yogurt into the strainer and allow to drain for 1 hour. Transfer yogurt to a large bowl; discard cheesecloth and dripping liquid.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Add pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, molasses, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to the yogurt and beat with an electric mixer until blended. Pour pumpkin batter into cookie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until edges are firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes. Set the pan on a wire rack, and allow to cool.

Description: 
Let me start by saying I have disliked pumpkin pie my entire life, until a dear friend passed this one along to me last year. It originally called for sour cream in place of Greek yogurt, but in my bid to make it healthier, I switched it up and it works beautifully! Enjoy!
