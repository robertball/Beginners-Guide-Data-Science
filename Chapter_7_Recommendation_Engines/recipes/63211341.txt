Ingredients:
1 cup white flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 ½ cup shortening (May substitute butter.)
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 large eggs
½ c water (reduce to 1/4 c if using butter)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups grated sweet potato

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour a loaf pan.
In a medium-sized bowl, combine flours, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder and salt, set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugars.
Add the eggs, vanilla and water. Stir in grated sweet potato.
Add dry ingredients and mix until just combined. The batter will be quite thick.
Pour into prepared pan (I use a 13x4x4 bread pan) and bake for about 50 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. If using a 9x5 inch pan the baking time will be about 10-15 minutes longer. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from pan and cool completely on rack before slicing.
