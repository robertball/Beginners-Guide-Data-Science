Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using whisk until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk and stir until mixture is moistened.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, about 15 turns. Pat or roll the dough out into a 3/4-inch thick round. Cut circles with a 2-inch biscuit cutter or cup and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve warm.
