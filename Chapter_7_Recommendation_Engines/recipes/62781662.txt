Ingredients:
1 can (12.5oz) - Tyson's Premium Chunk White Chicken
1 cup - sour cream onion dip
1 can (10.75oz) - cream of chicken soup
1 roll of buttery round crackers, crushed
1 rounded Tbsp. - butter or margarine
3 cups - French's fried onions
Morton's Nature's Seasonings added to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Drain all water from chicken.
Put the chicken in a medium bowl and "shred" the chunks with a fork.
Add the onion dip, cream of chicken soup, crackers, and 2 cups of the fried onions to the chicken. Mix together with a spoon, so everything is even throughout.
Put the mix in a small casserole dish. Add butter on top and smooth out casserole.
Add remaining cup of French's fried onions evenly over top of casserole. Sprinkle Nature's Seasonings on top.
Place on center rack in preheated oven. Allow to bake for 30 minutes or until onions on top are a nice golden brown.
