salt to taste
pepper to taste
onion, chopped, 1/4 cup per person
vegetable oil
vinegar
chives (optional)
bacon, cooked and broken into pieces (optional)
lettuce, shredded (optional)

Directions:
Peel and slice potatoes.
Place potatoes in a medium sauce pan.  Fill pan with water to an inch over the potatoes.
Bring water to a boil.  Cook potatoes until just tender, being careful not to overcook.  Drain.
Place potatoes in medium bowl.  Add onions, salt and pepper.  Add enough vegetable oil to moisten potatoes.
Let potatoes stand, covered, for 2-3 hours.
Add more oil, so potatoes glisten.

Add chives, bacon or lettuce, as desired (opt.)
Serve immediately.
