Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
Roughly 1 and 1/2 tsp cinnamon
roughly 1/2 tsp nutmeg
8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
Place the bottom crust in your pan.
Mix 80% of the syrup with the apples; reserve the reamining for the crust.
Fill pie sheel with apples, mounded slightly.
Cover with a lattice work crust.
Gently brush the remaining syrup over the crust, pouring any remaining syrup through the crackes.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. (Be sure to put tin foil under it to catch spills.)  Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.  Be careful not to undercook, or bottom crust will not be done.
