Ingredients:
6 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pound mushrooms, thinly sliced
2 shallots or 1/2 large onion, diced
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
1/2 cup dry white wine
sea salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons finely chopped chives
4 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Saut√© the onions in a 1 TBS olive oil until the onions are translucent. Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring, for about a minute.
Add the rice to the onions and wine in the pan and cook, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes.  This coats the rice with the oil and starts cooking the outer layer of the rice, which will help to keep the grains separate as they continue to cook in the slow cooker.
Put the rice and onion mixture into the slow cooker.  Pour in the broth and stir in the mushrooms.
Cover the slow cooker and set the temperature control on High.  Allow the rice to cook for two hours.
Uncover the slow cooker and stir the rice mixture.  Taste to see if the rice is al dente.  When the rice is al dente, turn off the slow cooker and stir in butter, chives, and parmesan.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
