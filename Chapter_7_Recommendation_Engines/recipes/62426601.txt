Ingredients:
1/2 small onion, sliced
2 tbsp butter, divided
2 slices whole wheat bread
1 slice mozzarella cheese
1 pinch oregano
1 pinch basil

Directions:
In a small skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tbsp of the butter. Add onion and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, butter both slices of bread with the remaining butter. On one slice, place mozzarella and herbs on the unbuttered side.
When onions are done, arrange them over the cheese and herbs. Place the other slice of bread on top, buttered side out. Transfer sandwich to the skillet and cook on medium heat until both slices of bread are toasted and the mozza is melted.
