Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, peeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Stir olive oil and garlic salt together in a small bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add carrots to the plastic bag, seal, and shake to coat carrots completely in oil mixture. Arrange coated carrots onto the prepared baking sheet.
Roast carrots in preheated oven until crisp-tender, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese over carrots and continue roasting until cheese is lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Garnish with additional Parmesan cheese to serve, according to your taste.

Description: 
I made this for Christmas, and one of my guests said the carrots were 'off the chain!' The flavor was amazing! The cheese was nicely crusted combined with the carrot and a little garlic! YUM! A nice change from the ordinary green veggie and still healthy!
