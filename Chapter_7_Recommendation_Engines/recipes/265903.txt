Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
3 pounds butternut squash, peeled and diced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine olive oil, parsley, herbes de Provence, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add butternut squash pieces and toss to coat. Place in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is soft, about 15 minutes. Turn squash pieces and bake 10 more minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes more.

Description: 
Garlic complements the sweetness of the butternut squash very well. This is a great side or vegetarian main dish from the oven. If you cut the squash into small pieces, it will cut down on the cooking time as well.
