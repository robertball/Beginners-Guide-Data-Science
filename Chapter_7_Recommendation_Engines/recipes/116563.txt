Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cold butter or margarine
6 tablespoons cold water
FILLING:
6 cups sliced peeled tart apples
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
CREAM SAUCE:
1 egg
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup sour cream

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Divide dough in half. Roll out one portion. Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom pastry; trim pastry even with edge of plate. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Combine the sugar, flour, lemon peel, cinnamon and salt; add to apples and gently toss. Mound apples in pastry shell so center is higher than edges; sot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie; cut a hole in the center about the size of a quarter. Place over filling; trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry. Add decorative cutouts if desired.
Cover edges loosely with foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F and remove foil. Bake 35-40 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, beat the egg, sugar and lemon juice. Cook and stir over low heat until mixture is thickened and reaches 160 degrees F. Remove from the heat; stir is cream cheese and sour cream until smooth. Slowly pour into center of pie. Cool on wire rack for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until serving.

Like my mother, I have a reputation for making great pies...thanks to wonderfully unique recipes like this. After the pie is baked, a cream sauce is poured inside. It's irresistible!
