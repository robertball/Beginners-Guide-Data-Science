Ingredients:
1 cup mashed white sweet potato, or Yukon gold
½ cup water
1½ teaspoons salt
½ teaspoon chili powder
¼ cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes with green chiles

Directions:
Steam the potatoes until they are fork-tender. Once the potatoes are very tender, fork-mash them and measure out one cup of mashed potatoes to use for this recipe.
In a high-speed blender, combine the cup of mashed sweet potato, water, salt, chili powder, nutritional yeast, and lemon juice and blend until completely smooth. Warm the diced tomatoes in a small saucepan over medium heat, then pour the cheese sauce from the blender into the pan and stir well to combine.
Heat the mixture until your desired serving temperature is reached, then serve warm with your favorite chips or crudites.
