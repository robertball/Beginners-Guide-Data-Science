Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups quick-cooking oats
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla  until smooth. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the quick oats and chocolate chips. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place balls 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet and press to flatten slightly using a fork.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are golden brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
