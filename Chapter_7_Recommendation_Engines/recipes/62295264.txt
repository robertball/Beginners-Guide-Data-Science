Ingredients:
1 lb. of ground turkey (or beef)
1 packet taco seasoning
1 cup of salsa
2 tortillas - I used whole wheat
1/2 can refried beans
1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles
2 cups frozen corn, thawed
1 small can of sliced black olives
Shredded cheddar cheese - I actually used "Mexican Style"

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground turkey (or beef) - add taco seasoning. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a 2.5 quart baking dish, pour half the salsa on the bottom. Place 1 tortilla in the baking dish - mine didn't fit perfect, but close enough. You'll be having two layers, so you'll split the ingredients in half.
Spread half of the refried beans over the entire tortilla then add cheese, ground turkey, tomatoes, corn, black olives, then spread some salsa over the top. Add another tortilla and repeat. You can finish it with more cheese and black olives.
Bake covered (with lid or foil) for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 5 minutes.
Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. I served it with sour cream on top.
