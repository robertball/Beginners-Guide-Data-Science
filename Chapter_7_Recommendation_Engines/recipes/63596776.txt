Ingredients:
1 shallot, diced fine
2tbsp Olive Oil (butter is better...)
Salt and Pepper
2 cups Arborio Rice
4-5 cups Chicken Stock, warm
Lots of mushroom, sliced
More olive oil or butter
Salt and pepper
Italian seasoning

Directions:
In a pan over medium heat, saute the shallot in olive oil until they're soft.
Add the rice and stir with the shallot, until the rice is just sort of opaque on the outside.
Start adding the stock, 1/2cup or so at a time.
(don't add it all at once!)
Stir until the stock is absorbed, then add more.
Repeat!
While that's going, in another pan on medium heat, add more oil and the mushrooms, salt, pepper, and a bit of italian seasoning. Stir occasionally until the mushrooms are cooked through.
Keep tasting the rice as the stock is added--you want it sort of al dente--soft, but with a bit of firmness (not crunch!) at the center.
When it's done, add the mushrooms and stir.
Add more salt and pepper as necessary.
Or Parmesan cheese :)

Description: 
Mushroom Risotto without cheese. Don't get me wrong, it's better with Parmesan mixed in at the end, or some butter, but this still tastes great.
