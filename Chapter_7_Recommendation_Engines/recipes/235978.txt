Ingredients:
4 cups butternut squash cubes
1 teaspoon salt
2 dashes ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon curry powder
salt to taste
1 large Honeycrisp apple - peeled, cored, and diced
1/2 large yellow onion, diced
3 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup almond milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Spread butternut squash cubes onto a baking sheet; season with 1 teaspoon salt and cinnamon.
Roast squash in preheated oven until fork-tender, about 30 minutes.
Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir curry powder and a few dashes salt into the oil. Saute apple and onion in the seasoned coconut oil until softened, about 10 minutes.
Pour vegetable broth and almond milk into the pot; add butternut squash and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer about 20 minutes; season with salt.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
