Ingredients:
¼ cup chili-garlic sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 pound chicken, cut into bite-size pieces
1 ½ cups coarsely chopped fresh basil
1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained
1  green bell pepper, sliced into strips
1  red bell pepper, sliced into strips
1 cup fresh green beans (2-inch pieces)
1 cup snow peas
1 large carrot, thinly sliced
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Mix chili-garlic sauce, oil, and fish sauce in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir just until heated through, about 1 minute.
Stir chicken, basil, bamboo shoots, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, green beans, snow peas, carrot, and mushrooms into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium; cover and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes and salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
