Ingredients:
3 large egg whites, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups prepared frozen BACARDI® Mixers Pina Colada
1 3/4 cups well-shaken low-fat buttermilk
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups all-purpose flour for dredging
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 large red onions, cut crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices
1 liter olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk together eggs, BACARDI(R) Mixers Pina Colada mix, buttermilk, flour, salt and cayenne until smooth. Place the flour for dredging in a separate bowl.
Heat 1-inch of oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Working in batches of 4 or 5, dredge onion slices in flour and dip rings into batter, letting excess drip off.
Cook in skillet until golden brown, about one minute per side.
Transfer browned rings to a baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, turning once, until crisp.
Remove from oven and let sit for 2-3 minutes to cool. Salt to taste and serve with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce.
