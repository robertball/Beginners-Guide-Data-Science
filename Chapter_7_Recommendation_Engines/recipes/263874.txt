Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
6 eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 cups chopped spinach
1 onion, chopped
1 cup shredded Gouda cheese
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Grease a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish with butter.
Whisk eggs, cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a bowl. Stir in spinach, onion, and Gouda cheese. Pour into the prepared souffle dish.
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)).  Place water in the pot and add the trivet. Place the prepared dish on the trivet with an aluminum sling, folding ends on top. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 25 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the fast-release method, about 5 minutes. Open and remove the lid. Lift quiche by grabbing the ends of the foil sling. Let cool for 5 minutes.
