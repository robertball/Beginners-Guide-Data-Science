Ingredients:
1 (13.5 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
1/3 cup raw sugar
3 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Combine coconut cream and coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir cocoa powder, sugar, corn syrup, and sea salt into the coconut mixture; blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
Place in the refrigerator until chilled, 1 hour to overnight.
Pour coconut mixture into an ice cream maker; freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.

Description: 
The trouble with most vegan ice creams is texture and flavor. If you use just coconut milk, you end up with something that tastes watery. The coconut cream (not cream of coconut) is coconut milk with twice the fat, which helps in the flavor and texture departments. The corn syrup helps smooth out the texture as well. You end up with a delicious, rich, velvety chocolate ice cream that will have people wondering if it really is vegan or not.
