Ingredients:
4 cups tapioca starch
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Place tapioca flour in a large bowl. Add sugar, butter, eggs, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well until a soft dough forms.
Pinch off a small piece of dough and roll out into a rope the length of a pencil on your work surface; coil tightly into a spiral. Repeat with remaining dough. Arrange spirals on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked on the bottom but still pale on top, about 15 minutes.
