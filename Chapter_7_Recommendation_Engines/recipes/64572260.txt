Ingredients:
4 tsp olive oil
8 bone-in chicken thighs (about 1-3/4 pounds), skin removed
1tsp of tumeric powder
1 tsp of salt
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 Tbsp lime juice
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp white vinegar
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
2 tsp cornstarch
2 Tbsp cold water
8  green onions, sliced
Hot cooked rice or ramen noodles optional

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Mix 1 tumeric powder and salt. Coat mixture on chicken and fry chicken; cooking  8-10 minutes on each side or until golden brown. In a small bowl, whisk water, brown sugar, lime juice, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, pepper flakes and five-spice powder. Pour over chicken. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 30-35 minutes or until chicken is tender, turning chicken occasionally.
In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and cold water until smooth; stir into pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir 1 minute or until sauce is thickened. Sprinkle with green onions. If desired, serve with rice.
Freeze option: Cool chicken. Freeze in freezer containers. To use, partially thaw in refrigerator overnight. Heat slowly in a covered skillet until a thermometer inserted in chicken reads 165Â°, stirring occasionally and adding a little water if necessary.
