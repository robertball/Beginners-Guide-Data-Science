Ingredients:
4 ounces linguine pasta
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 1 inch medallions
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the pork tenderloin, and cook until meat is no longer pink inside. Remove from skillet and keep warm.
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat; stir in mushrooms and cook until tender.  Pour in chicken broth and bring to a simmer.  Once the broth is hot, stir the blue cheese and salt until the cheese has melted.
Mix together the water and cornstarch and slowly add to the simmering broth.   Cook for 1 minute until thick and clear, stirring continually.  Serve over linguine and pork medallions.
