Description: 
This is a great vegetarian substitute for buffalo wings; it's also much more affordable than buying chicken wings, and meat eaters love it too. If you want to spend more time on it, you can make your own sauce and breadcrumbs, but I'm often looking for a quick potluck meal, and this is an easy, fast recipe that always gets great reviews.
