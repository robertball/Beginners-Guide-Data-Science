Ingredients:
2 Teaspoons ground mustard seed
1 Teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 Teaspoon ground allspice
2 1/2 Teaspoons salt
1 Teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 Cup Balsamic vinegar
1/4 Cup olive oil
1 1/4 Pounds pork tenderloin
4 Cups cauliflower florets
2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 Teaspoon dried rosemary

Directions:
Please note that this recipe requires marinating the pork for 2-24 hours before cooking.
Combine the ground mustard, garlic powder, allspice, 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, balsamic vinegar and olive oil in a resealable plastic bag.  Add pork and shake to distribute the marinade.  Squeeze out air and seal bag.  Refrigerate and marinate for at least 2 and up to 24 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350°F.  Place marinated pork into a glass baking dish along with the marinade.  Bake while basting 3-4 times until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145°F; about 1 hour.
While the pork is cooking prepare the cauliflower.  In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with the extra virgin olive oil, rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon salt until well coated.  Arrange on baking sheet in a single layer.   Bake along with the pork for 40-50 minutes until lightly browned and tender.
Allow the pork to rest 5-10 minutes before serving with the cauliflower.
