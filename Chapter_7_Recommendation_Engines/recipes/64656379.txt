Ingredients:
2 (12 oz) Jones Dairy Farm All Natural Pork Sausage Rolls
12 Hawaiian dinner rolls
8 large eggs, scrambled
6 slices pepper jack cheese
8 slices American cheese
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
Warm large skillet over medium heat. Form sausage into 12 patties, slightly larger than one dinner roll. Add sausage to skillet and cook until completely cooked through.
Meanwhile, using a serrated knife, cut rolls in half lengthwise (without breaking apart). Place bottom half of rolls in 7x10-inch or 9x13-inch baking dish; set tops aside.
Scoop scrambled eggs onto bottom rolls; top with pepper jack. Place sausage on top of pepper jack and top with American cheese. Carefully top with top buns.
Combine melted butter and maple syrup in small bowl. Brush over tops of rolls allowing the sauce to drip down sides and into the bottom. Use entire amount.
Bake 15-20 minutes or until cheese is bubbly and melted. Serve and enjoy!
