1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup water
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup margarine
4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
5 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup margarine, oil, 4 tablespoons cocoa and water.  Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring often.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. Make a well in the center, and pour in the cocoa mixture.  Stir until smooth.  Mix in the buttermilk, 2 teaspoons vanilla, cinnamon, baking soda and eggs.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool slightly before frosting.
