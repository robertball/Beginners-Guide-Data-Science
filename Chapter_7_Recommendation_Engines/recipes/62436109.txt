Ingredients:
2 14 ounce boxes of Chex whole grain cereal (such as multi bran)
Olive oil spray (or you can use canola or another oil in a mister bottle)
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp jalapeno powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp parsley flakes
1/2 tsp salt (to taste)
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix (or use the recipe on AR for this - just as good and you can adjust the spices/salt)
*See footnote below for other flavor combo ideas*

Directions:
Place cereal in a large bowl.
Spray with PAM until lightly coated, mix, spray again, mix, spray again.
You only need a light coating so the dry ingredients stick to the cereal.
Add your dry ingredients and lightly toss cereal around making sure all ingredients have adhered to the cereal.
If you find some dry ingredients are still on the bottom of the bowl then give another spray of PAM and mix again.
Store in a large ziplock baggie or airtight container.
