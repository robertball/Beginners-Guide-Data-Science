Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups potatoes, peeled and diced
1/3 cup celery, diced
1/3 cup onion, finely chopped
3/4 cup cooked ham, diced
3 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon pepper, to taste
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons flour
2 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and water in a stockpot.
Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute.
Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot or crockpot, and cook soup until heated through.
Serve immediately.
