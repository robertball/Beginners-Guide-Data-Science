Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 large onion, sliced
1 large zucchini, julienned
1 (14 ounce) package tofu, drained and cubed
1 clove garlic
7 Thai chiles, chopped
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1/4 cup lime juice
2/3 teaspoon sugar
1/3 teaspoon salt
1 quart water
8 ounces cellophane noodles
1/2 head lettuce, chopped

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover, and bring a boil. Remove from heat, cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and zucchini until tender. Mix in the tofu, and continue to cook and stir until browned on all sides.
With a mortar and pestle, grind the garlic and Thai chiles into a fine paste. Mix with the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and salt.
Bring 1 quart water to boil in a pot. Turn off heat, and soak the cellophane noodles in the hot water 1 minute, or until soft.
In a large bowl, toss together the eggs, tofu mixture, garlic and chile paste, noodles, and lettuce.
