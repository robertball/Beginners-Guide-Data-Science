Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) fresh pumpkin, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Combine pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon sticks, and cloves in a large pot over low heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until pumpkin is very soft, about 30 minutes. Mix in coconut and remove from heat. Mash large pumpkin pieces with a potato mash, or leave them slightly chunky. Let cool for 10 minutes.

Description: 
This pumpkin dessert is very famous in Brazil and is eaten everywhere - we call it Doce de Ab√≥bora com Coco. You only need 5 ingredients. Serve cold or at room temperature. It is usually eaten with queso fresco, but I like to serve it with goat cheese or eat it on bread.
