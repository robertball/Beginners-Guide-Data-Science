Ingredients:
4 cups tapioca starch (such as Bob's Red MillÂ®)
1 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 1/4 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
3 eggs
2 teaspoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Pour tapioca starch into a wide bowl.
Combine 1 cup water, vegetable oil, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Slowly pour over the tapioca, mixing with a spoon until evenly combined. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Stir Mexican cheese blend and eggs into the tapioca mixture. Knead dough until soft and sticky, 5 to 10 minutes. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if dough seems dry.
Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Pao de Queijo is a traditional peasants' bread from Minas-Gerais state in Brazil, but is now a delight countrywide. Last time I visited Brazil I was surprised to find cheese bread at the airport, offered along with American-brand pizza, though with a Brazilian brand that reminds us of this old Mineira tradition. (Minas-Gerais means the general mines, as this part of Brazil was the first where rich mines of gold, diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones were found. It is also where one of the world's richest iron ore deposits are located.)
