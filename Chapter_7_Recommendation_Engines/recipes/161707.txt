Description: 
This is a shredded, slow-cooker version of my favorite chicken mole, created when I knew I wouldn't have time in the evening to make the real thing for dinner.  If you can't find ancho chili powder, you can substitute regular, but use a little more; and use your favorite type of hot sauce. I love Golden Habanero, but any kind tastes good!
