Ingredients:
1 lb. (500 grams) Icing Sugar
1 Small Bottle of Corn Syrup (approx. 500ml.)
1/2 lb. Soft Margarine (1/2 of a standard tub)
1/3 to 1/2 of a bottle of Maple Flavouring

Directions:
With an electric mixer, mix margarine, corn syrup and Maple Flavouring until light & fluffy.  Gradually (and carefully) add icing sugar and mix well. Taste and add more maple flavouring if desired.
Note:  Mixture may be too thick to finish with electric mixer, if so mix by hand.
Note 2:  This is for a single batch, but it is easy to double.
Note 3:  A single batch makes about 5 250 ml. bottles.
