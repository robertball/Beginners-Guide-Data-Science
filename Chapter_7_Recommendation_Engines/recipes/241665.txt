Ingredients:
1 package Duncan Hines® Salted Caramel Brownie Mix
1 large egg
1/3 cup oil
1/3 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees  F for metal and glass pans, or 325 degrees  F for dark or coated pans.*
Grease sides and bottom of pan with shortening or oil spray.
Empty brownie mix, egg, oil, and water in a large bowl. Stir until well blended (about 50 strokes).
Spread into a greased pan. Drizzle the salted caramel pouch in lines across the pan. Using the tip of a knife, drag it through the batter and caramel to get the desired marble effect.
Bake 35-38 minutes for an 8"x8" pan, or 30-33 minutes for a 9"x9" pan. *Add 3-5 minutes for dark or coated pans. Brownies are done when toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge of pan comes out clean.
Cool completely in pan on wire rack before cutting and serving.
