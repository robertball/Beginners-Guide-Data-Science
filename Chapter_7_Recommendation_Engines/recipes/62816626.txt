Ingredients:
2 boneless chicken breasts
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbsp olive oil
10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 mozzerella cheese
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
30 wonton wrappers

Directions:
Warm olive oil in a pan and add garlic.   Cook chicken in oil until the juices run clear.   Remove from heat and dice into 1/2" or smaller cubes.
In a large bowl, combine chicken, spinach, onion and cheeses.
Put a small amount of water on a plate and dip each wonton wrapper in it.   This helps them stick together.
Place one water-dipped wonton down, then another directly on top of it.
On top of this, put about 1/8 cup of chicken/spinach mixture.   Then add another water-dipper wrapper on top of this and another on top of that one.
Now crimp the edges of the wrappers with a fork.
Boil in salted water for 5-8 minutes.
Serve with a nice alfredo sauce.
