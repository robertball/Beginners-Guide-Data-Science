Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 pound beef flank steak, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon peanut oil
2  teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
2 large green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast sesame seeds for 1 to2 minutes, or until the seeds begin to turn golden brown; set aside.
Whisk together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, sugar, garlic, cornstarch  and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Toss beef with marinade, cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes to overnight.
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large, nonstick skillet over high heat. Add the green onions, and cook for 5 to 10 seconds before stirring in the beef. Cook and stir until the beef is no longer pink and is beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
