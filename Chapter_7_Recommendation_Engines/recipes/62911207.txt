Description: 
These are reminiscent of the rolled cookies my grandmother always baked for Easter and Christmas. I love baking these with my grandchildren, icing with Sugar Cookie Icing, which is colorful and easy to work with.  The house will smell like Christmas while you are baking these!Modified from: The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies
