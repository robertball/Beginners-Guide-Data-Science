Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
1-1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp yeast
1-1/2 luke-warm water

Directions:
1.  combine the three dry in a large bowl then pour in the luke-warm water.  Stir until completely combines,  Dough will look messy and not and  smooth and that is completely okay.
2.  Once combined, cover tightly with plastic wtp and let sit on the counter overnight.  I let mine sit for about 15 hours.  Let it rise anywhere from 12-18 hours.  Dough will be puffed up, appear bubbly and be sticky.  It won't be in a ball shape and that is normal.
3.  when dough is done rising and ready to bake, preheat oven to 450 degrees
4.  heavily flour clean countertop or surface.  Turn dough onto floured surface and shape into a round ball.  Cover lightly with plastic wrap (you can just lay the plastic wrap that you used to cover your large bowl over the top) and let dough rest
5.  while dough is resting, place your dutch oven into the oven for 30 minutes to preheat.
6.  after dutch oven is preheated, place ball of dough in the cents of the dutch oven and cover with lid.  The Baker Chick said:  You can put a piece of parchment paper under it if your dutch oven doesn't have an enamel coating.
7.  note handles will be extremely HOT - use heavy hot mitts
8.  Bake at 450 degrees for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, remove lid and bake for an additional 15 minutes until done, bread will be golden colour
9. let cool, if you slice too soon, it will become doughy
