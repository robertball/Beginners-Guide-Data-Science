Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 loaf Italian bread
12 ounces shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix melted butter, parsley, olive oil, and garlic together in a bowl.
Slice bread diagonally without cutting all the way through; do the same on the opposite diagonal to create cube-shaped sections still attached to the bottom crust.
Spoon butter mixture carefully between sections; stuff in shredded Italian cheese blend. Wrap loaf in aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; unwrap and bake until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
An easy way to dress up a plain loaf of bread! Great as an appetizer or as a side dish to grilled steaks. My local grocery sells a blend of mozzarella and provolone cheese that I use.
