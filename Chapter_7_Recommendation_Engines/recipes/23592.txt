Description: 
This recipe has been passed around our family for years.  I do not know the origin, but our family loves it.  It is now a holiday tradition.  It's simple and quick, made with cut up hot dogs or cocktail wieners, brown sugar, whiskey, and tangy ketchup! Serve these little dogs with toothpicks.
