Description: 
I came up with this recipe while prepping ingredients to make a quiche. I realized the veggie mix made a wonderful salad just by itself! Don't skip the Parmesan-Romano cheese, it cuts the acidity of the Worcestershire sauce and garlic and makes for a wonderful flavor blend. My boyfriend heartily approves! This recipe would also be a good vegetable base for a quiche.
