Description: 
My grandmother (Nonnie) used to make this chowder using leftover veggies from the week and a piece of ham on the bone.  It's incredibly creamy and the thyme and pepper make it such a savory dish.  I use a piece of boneless ham steak, but I find that if I don't use ham on the bone, I need to add some salt to get the flavor right.  Enjoy!
