Ingredients:
1 block (8 oz) 1/3 less fat cream cheese
8 oz bottled blue cheese dressing
8 oz Frank's Red Hot sauce
1- 1/2 lbs chicken breast
Tostitoes Scoops
Celery

Directions:
In a dutch oven on the stove, melt the cream cheese, blue cheese, and Red Hot together, stirring occasionally.
While they are melting, cook chicken in any desired manner (I usually microwave the chicken for 4 minutes per side-a little overdone is ok, it makes it easier to shred).
Shred the chicken into the melted cheese mixture.
Serve w/Tostitoes and celery sticks.
