Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 packet Italian dressing and seasoning mix
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon celery seed
3 tomatoes, diced
3 carrots, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable broth
1 cup uncooked elbow macaroni
1 (15.5 ounce) can white beans, drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, undrained
1 (5 ounce) package spinach, chopped
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add olive oil. Add onion and garlic to the hot oil and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add Italian dressing mix, oregano, basil, and celery seed. Saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Add tomatoes, carrots, and zucchini to the pot and stir to coat. Add broth, macaroni, beans, and corn. Stir to be sure macaroni is covered by the broth. Press cancel and select Soup setting; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Stir in chopped spinach. Add Parmesan cheese to individual bowls to taste.
