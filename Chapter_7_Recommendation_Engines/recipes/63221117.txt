Ingredients:
3 cups of fresh mint leaves, rinsed, drained and packed. No stems.
2 cups whole milk, divided
1 cups heavy cream
2/3 cup sugar
A pinch of salt
5 egg yolks
1 cup chocolate chips (I used mint chocolate chips)

Directions:
Heat mint leaves, cream and 1 cup of milk on the stove until just steaming (do not let boil.) Remove from heat and let stand, covered for 1 hour.
Strain the mixture into a separate bowl, pressing on the mint leaves to get out all the liquid. Return the mixture to the saucepan and add sugar and salt. Heat just until sugar has dissolved.
In a medium sized bowl, whisk egg yolks. Slowly pour heated milk mixture into egg yolks, whisking constantly. Return mixture to the saucepan.
Cook over low heat until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.
Strain though a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl. Add remaining cup of milk and stir to combine.
Place in fridge until completely cool then process according to the directions on your ice cream maker.
Stir in chocolate chips once ice cream has formed.
Enjoy!
