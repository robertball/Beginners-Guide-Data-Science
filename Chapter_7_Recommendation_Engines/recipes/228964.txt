Description: 
A much lighter pasta Alfredo recipe that's packed with veggies and flavor, but tastes as good as the original. Linguine is extended with shredded zucchini 'noodles' to lower the calorie count and up the nutrition! I promise you can't even tell the zucchini is in there. A great way to use up summer's zucchini abundance too!
