Description: 
We served this at our twin daughter's graduation open house.   Since that time, it is our most requested pasta salad.   My daughters will make batches of this to take back to college to share with their friends.   Scale back the salt and MSG if it suits your tastes or needs, but in this recipe the amounts listed blend in very nicely.
