Ingredients:
2 pounds asparagus, cooked and drained
1 cup olive oil
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
4 radishes sliced
1/4 cup finely chopped green pepper
3 Tablespoons dill relish
1 Tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
1 Tablespoon fresh chives, chopped
3 hard boiled eggs, sliced
2 tomatoes, quartered

Directions:
While asparagus is steaming, whisk together all other ingredients until well blended.  Place asparagus in dressing and stir just enough to cover well.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, the longer the better.
To serve, fill a platter with salad greens.  Remove asparagus from dressing with a slotted spoon, arrange over greens.  Garnish with sliced hard boiled eggs and tomatoes

Description: 
Mix together early in the day, or better yet the night before.  If you put the asparagus in the dressing while still hot, it will absorb more of the flavor
