Ingredients:
2 tbsp. vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 celery stalks, chopped
1 carrot, diced
1 can (28oz/800g) whole tomatoes
1 can (28oz/800g) crushed tomatoes
½ tsp. basil
1 small can of tomato paste
2 tsp. chicken stock
1 cup. half and half
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large soup pot, heat oil over medium/low heat
Mix in vegetables and cook until tender.
Add tomatoes, water, chicken stock, and simmer until veggies become extremely tender, 12-15 more minutes.
Remove 1/3 of your soup mix, let cool and pour into blender, puree mixture.
Pour puree mix back into your soup, stir in the seasonings and half and half.
Reheat back to a simmer and make sure not to bring your soup to a boil when reheating.
Like chunky soup? Skip the puréeing part of the recipe and just stir in the seasons and continue to simmer!
