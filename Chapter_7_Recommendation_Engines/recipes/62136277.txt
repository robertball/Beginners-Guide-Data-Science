Ingredients:
1 lb. Ground Beef
1/4 of a White Onion, chopped
1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder
1/2 tsp. Oregano
1 Jar (1lb. 10oz.) Ragu Chunky Sauce (Tomato, onion, garlic)
3 tbs. Granulated Sugar
18 Lasagna Noodles
1 Beaten Egg
1 15 oz. Container Ricotta Cheese
3/4 cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
2 tbs. Snipped Fresh Parsley
1 Bag Shredded Mozzarella Cheese

Directions:
Sauce: Brown and chop ground beef. Saute with onion and garlic powder until onion is tender. Add Ragu sauce and sugar. Let simmer for ten minutes.
Meanwhile, cook noodles for ten minutes or until they are tender yet firm. Drain and set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Filling: Combine beaten egg, ricotta, parmesan, and snipped parsley.
Assemble: Lay noodles on flat, non stick surface.
Spoon on one layer of cheese filling, one layer meat sauce, and one layer of mozzarella cheese. Place another noodle on top and roll up like a jelly roll.(Thickness of layers can be done to preference)
Bake: Place rolls in greased 9x13in. pan(glass works best for me). Spread a spoonful of sauce on top of each roll.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Melt a little more parmesan and mozzarella on top and ENJOY!
