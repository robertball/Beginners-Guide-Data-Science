Ingredients:
7 cups rolled oats
1 cup wheat germ
1 cup unsweetened flaked coconut
1/2 cup unsalted sunflower seeds
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup boiling water
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees  F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the oats, wheat germ, coconut, sunflower seeds and almonds. In a separate bowl, mix together the oil, honey, boiling water, brown sugar, salt and vanilla. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until evenly coated. Spread in a thin layer on a large baking sheet.
Bake for 60 to 90 minutes in the preheated oven. Stir every 30 minutes, until lightly toasted and fragrant. Granola will crisp up more when cooled.
