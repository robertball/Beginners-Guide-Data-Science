2 3/4 cups all purpose flour*
2 tsp cream of tartar
1 tsp baking soda

Heat oven to 400F(200C)
Thoroughly mix butter, Crisco, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and the eggs.
Blend in flour, cream of tartar, soda and salt.
Shape dough by rounded teaspoonfuls into balls (rolling between hands works great.)
Mix the remaining sugar and cinnamon on a saucer, and roll dough balls in mixture. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheet.
Bake 8-10 minutes or until set. Remove -immediately- from baking sheet!
