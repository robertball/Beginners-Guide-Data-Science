Ingredients:
10 chocolate wafer cookies
4 ounces reduced fat cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup DannonÂ® Natural Flavors Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons shaved chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Line 8 standard size cupcake cups with paper liners.
Set a chocolate wafer in each cup. Crush the remaining cookies, and set aside.
Process the cream cheese, Dannon(R) Natural Flavors Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt, sugar, egg, and cocoa in a food processor until smooth. Add the melted chocolate and process just until blended in.
Divide the batter among the cups, and sprinkle with the cookie crumbs. Bake until the cheesecakes are set, about 20 minutes. Cool on a rack, and then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for an hour or more. Serve garnished with shaved chocolate.
