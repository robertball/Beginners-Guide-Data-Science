4 cups great northern beans
1 pound bacon
1 onion, chopped
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Soak beans overnight in cold water. Simmer the beans in the same water for 1 - 2 hours, until tender. Drain and reserve the liquid. Arrange the beans in a 5-6 quart slow-cooker by placing a portion of the beans in the bottom of dish, and layering them with bacon and onion.
In a saucepan, combine molasses, salt, pepper, dry mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and pour over the beans. Pour in 2 cups of the reserved bean water. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours, until beans are tender. Add more liquid if necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry.
