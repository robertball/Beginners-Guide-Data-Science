Ingredients:
2 large butternut squash
1 large sweet potatoe
3 tbsp Brown sugar
2 tbsp Secret fall spice mix (follows)
Salt and Pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp oilve oil
1 cup diced white onion
4 cloves of garlic diced
2 cups Chicken Stock
2 cups Apple Cider
1/2 cup Heavy cream
8oz package of cream cheese
Sour cream
Spice Mix
Everything is equal parts - so decide how much you want to make. I make a spice jar full and that is about 2 teaspoons of each.
Pumpkin Pie Spice
Clove
Allspice
Nutmeg
cinnamon
kosher salt
black pepper
Mix together and I put this on all my fall root veggies in the oven with olive oil.  Butternut squash, acorn squash, carrots, sweet potatoes etc and then roast in the oven.

Directions:
Peel squash and pototoe and dice
place squash and pototoe in a large zip lock bag with the olive oil, salt, pepper, brown sugar and fall spice mix and shake.  Please them in a roasting pan on 350 until tender.
In a large pot place olive oil, onion and garlic and cook until tender.
Once squash and pototoes are done put in food processor with onions and garlic and puree to smooth.  Add back to your pot and mix with apple cider, chicken stock, cream cheese.  I would not taste to see if you need more salt and pepper.  I then return it to the food processor to puree again.  Back to the pot and add heavy cream.  Let simmer for an hour on low.  Sour cream is for topping with some croutons.
YUMMY!!!!
