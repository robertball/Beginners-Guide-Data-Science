Ingredients:
1- 1 lb. package of pre-sliced stir fry beef (or your own choice of beef sliced thinly)
2 packages of Ramen noodles
1-2 carrots (cleaned and cut into peeled strips)
1 small package of green onions (cut into 2-3" pieces)
1 container of sliced mushrooms
1 can of bean sprouts (or a few handfuls of fresh sprouts)
1 head of cabbage (chopped into 3-4" strips)
1 med-large yellow onion (sliced into 1-2" strips)
Soy Sauce, Aji-Mirin, Sesame Oil, Sugar, and Water

Directions:
Use a counter top electric skillet for cooking (or something like it with same size).
Begin by making the sauce. The sauce is approx. 2 cups water, a 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 cup sugar, 4 T. Aji-Mirin and splashes of sesame oil. Feel free to alter the sauce to your liking by adding more or less of each. It should have a slight sweet teriyaki taste when done.
Next prep veges and boil Ramen noodles and set aside.
Heat skillet and cook beef in a little oil.
Once meat is cooked through, push it to one corner of the skillet and begin to add veges and noodles to the skillet and pour sauce over top. Put lid on skillet and cook everything for approx. 20 minutes or until veges are tender.
Serve over rice.
