Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (2 pound) kabocha squash, seeded and cut into wedges
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup apple cider

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease lightly with cooking spray.
Place kabocha squash skin-side down on the baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until fork-tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Scoop squash flesh into a food processor; puree until smooth. Discard skin.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin tins with cooking spray.
Stir white sugar, brown sugar, canola oil, and olive oil in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Stir in 3/4 cup pureed squash and vanilla extract.
Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir gradually into the sugar mixture, alternating with apple cider, until smooth. Pour into muffin tins, filling each cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a simple yet comforting muffin. Tastes more like a spice cake that will stay moist for days. I make this all throughout the fall when kabocha squash is in season.
