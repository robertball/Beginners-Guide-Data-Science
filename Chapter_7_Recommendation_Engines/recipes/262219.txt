Ingredients:
2 potatoes
2 beets
2 carrots
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup walnuts, or to taste
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken
3/4 cup mayonnaise, divided, or to taste
1 pomegranate, seeds only, or more to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes, beets, and carrots into a large saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool, at least 15 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Peel potatoes, beets, and carrots. Coarsely grate vegetables and eggs into separate, individual bowls. Season with salt and pepper.
Place a small glass in the middle of a serving plate. Layer salad around the glass into a bracelet-like shape in the following order: potatoes, 1/2 the beets, carrots, walnuts, 1/2 the chicken, onion, eggs, remaining chicken, remaining beets, topping each addition with 1 tablespoons mayonnaise except for the walnuts, onion, and last beet layer.
Remove the glass and cover salad with the remaining 6 tablespoons mayonnaise. Garnish the top with pomegranate seeds.

Description: 
The Russian name for this classic Russian salad is garnet bracelet, named after a famous Russian short story by the same name since the pomegranate seeds resemble garnets. Layers of beets, potato, egg, walnuts, and chicken make this a fantastically different option for lunch or a buffet.
