Description: 
Too cold out to grill? No grill? No problem. These are tasty turkey burgers pan-fried on the stovetop. The secret is to only flip them once. And don't go for the super lean turkey. You'll want a little bit of fat to make them juicy. Top with your favorite cheese and garnishes. Serve on your choice of bun or lettuce wrap and enjoy.
