Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups cornmeal
3/4 teaspoon Creole seasoning
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 3/4 teaspoons white sugar
5 teaspoons shortening
1 1/4 cups boiling water
lard for frying

Directions:
Combine the cornmeal, Creole seasoning, onion, and sugar in a medium bowl.  Pour in boiling water and shortening; stir until the shortening melts.
Melt lard or bacon fat to a depth of 1/2 inch in a large skillet; bring to a temperature of 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) over medium-high heat.  Shape heaping tablespoons of the dough into flattened balls (thickness is a personal preference).  Fry in hot oil, turning once, until crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.
