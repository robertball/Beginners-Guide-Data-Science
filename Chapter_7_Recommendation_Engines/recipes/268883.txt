Description: 
I made these little chocolate-covered Oreo® devils with my kids yesterday and they were a huge hit! I did the covering and they did the decorating. We also did a second batch as little monsters, where we just dunked the tops into red sprinkles and then glued either 1 big eye or lots of little eyes onto them. They were gone in no time at the kids' school Halloween party.
