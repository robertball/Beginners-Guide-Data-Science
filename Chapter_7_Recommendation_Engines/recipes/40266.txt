Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package NESTLE速 TOLL HOUSE速 Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels, divided
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup water
1 (16 ounce) container prepared vanilla frosting, colored as desired

Directions:
MICROWAVE 1 1/2 cups morsels in medium, microwave-safe bowl on HIGH (100 percent) power for 1 minute; stir. Microwave at additional 10- to 20-second intervals, stirring until smooth; cool to room temperature.
COMBINE flour, baking soda, salt, ginger and cinnamon in medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in small mixer bowl until creamy; beat in molasses and melted chocolate. Gradually add flour mixture alternately with water, beating until smooth. Cover; refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm.

BAKE for 5 to 6 minutes or until edges are set but centers are still slightly soft. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.
PLACE remaining morsels in heavy-duty plastic bag. Microwave on HIGH (100 percent) power for 30 to 45 seconds; knead. Microwave for 10 seconds; knead until smooth. Cut tiny corner from bag; squeeze to pipe chocolate. Decorate with piped frosting or icing.
