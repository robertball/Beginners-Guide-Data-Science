Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons white sugar
2/3 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
5 eggs, room temperature
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 pinches salt
2 1/4 cups milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Grease and flour the bottoms and sides of the pans, making sure to remove excess flour.
Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until well incorporated.
Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl.
Mix milk, vanilla, and almond extract together in a third bowl.
Alternate adding flour mixture and milk mixture to butter mixture; blend well. Evenly distribute batter between the 2 prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove cakes from the oven; let sit for 5 minutes. Let cool completely on wire racks before removing cakes from the pans.
