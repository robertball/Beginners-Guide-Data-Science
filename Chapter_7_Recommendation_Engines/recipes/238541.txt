Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter
1 (7 ounce) bag cone-shaped corn snacks (such as Bugles®)
24 ounces white chocolate, broken into pieces

Directions:
Transfer peanut butter to a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until softened, 15 to 20 seconds.
Spoon peanut butter into a piping bag and gently fill each corn snack with peanut butter.
Melt white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Dip the filled corn snacks into the melted white chocolate until evenly coated; transfer to a sheet of waxed paper to cool.
