Ingredients:
2 pounds swordfish steaks
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup dry sherry
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 cup mango chutney

Directions:
Place swordfish steaks in a large, shallow bowl. In a small bowl, mix lemon juice, dry sherry, ginger and mango chutney. Pour the mixture over swordfish steaks, turning steaks to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place swordfish steaks in a medium baking dish. Cover with marinade. Bake in the preheated oven 20 to 30 minutes, basting occasionally with marinade, until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
