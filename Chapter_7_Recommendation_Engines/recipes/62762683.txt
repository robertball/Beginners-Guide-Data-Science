Ingredients:
3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
6 pitas
1 bag of fresh spinach leaves
For marinade: 1 cup lime juice (freshly squeezed is best, but bottled can be used with success)
1 cup cooking oil* (I use  ½ cup veg. and  ½ cup olive oil)
2 tsp. ground ginger
1 cup fresh strawberries, stems removed and crushed
2 tsp. dill seeds
2 tsp white sugar
2 tsp honey
For salsa:
1/2 medium red onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, de-seeded and minced
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 orange bell pepper, chopped
1/3 cup finely shredded fresh cilantro leaves
1 1/2  cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced (feel free to use up to 2 cups)
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine all ingredients for salsa and refrigerate.
Combine all ingredients for marinade and use to marinate your chicken breasts for about 2 hours.  Grill or bake chicken breasts and brush on the marinade during cooking.
Fill pitas with fresh spinach leaves, slices of cooked chicken and top with fresh salsa.

Description: 
This was the entry I submitted for the South Carolina Strawberry Festival recipe contest.  Although I did not win first place, I was honored to receive the Queen's Choice award and a yellow ribbon. The strawberries came from my own garden and I was lucky enough to have a plentiful amount of them to pick.
