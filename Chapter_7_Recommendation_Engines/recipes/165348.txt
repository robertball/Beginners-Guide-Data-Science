Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, diced
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 1/3 cups chopped onion
1/2 cup red wine
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 (16 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢), or to taste

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a heavy, 5 quart pot over medium-high heat until the grease begins to render out, about 3 minutes. Stir in the ground beef and onions. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour in the wine, and season with salt, basil, oregano, garlic, and pepper. Simmer uncovered until most of the wine has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the tomato paste, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and hot pepper sauce. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.

Description: 
This was passed down from my late Grandma Augusta to my mother and now me.  It's an Americanized take on a nice Italian meat sauce for spaghetti, loaded with meat, tomatoes and other good things. Enjoy!
