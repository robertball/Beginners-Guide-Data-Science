Description: 
When using this marinade on all our venison and beef cuts the results are outstanding.  Tender, delicious meat every time.  We mostly grill our meat.  Also, anyone who says they don't like wild game MUST try this recipe and you will become a fan of it!  The longer it sits in the marinade the more tender the meat will be.  It is really important to trim all the fat off the wild game.
