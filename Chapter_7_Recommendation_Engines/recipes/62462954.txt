1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup or less vegetable or chicken stock as need for consistency
Salt and pepper to taste

Description: 
This pesto has a wonderful flavor, with the red peppers, basil, and parsley coming through individually and in a wonderful combination. I served it on some whole wheat bruschetta. The pesto is only 144 calories with 13 grams of fat and 1 of fiber.
