Ingredients:
Pastry Crust:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
3 tablespoons ice cold water
Filling:
4 cups blackberries
1 1/4 cups sugar
6 tablespoons flour
3/4 cup water
1/4 stick butter or margarine

Directions:
Prepare pastry crust: Put flour, salt and butter into a bowl and mix with pastry blender or mixer until well combined. Add ice water and mix to pastry consistency. Refrigerate while preparing filling.
Combine washed berries, sugar, flour, and water, and place in oven-proof baking dish.
Roll out pastry on floured board and cut into 3/4" strips.  Arrange pastry strips  on top of berries in a criss-cross pattern. Place remaining strips of pastry in berry mixture.  Top with dollops of butter. Sprinkle lightly with sugar if desired.
Bake at 400Â° until crust is golden brown. (About 30 minutes or so) Serve hot with ice cream or whipped cream.
You can use any kind of berry in this recipe. I've even made a quadruple berry cobbler, with Raspberries, Blackberries, Strawberries and Blueberries....YUMMY!
