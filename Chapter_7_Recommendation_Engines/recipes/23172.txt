Ingredients:
1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
2 tablespoons minced onion
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent roll dough
2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, slowly cook and stir the mushrooms, parsley and onion in 2 tablespoons butter until tender. Drain and set aside.
Separate the dough into 4 rectangles. Cut rectangles in half, forming 8 squares, and arrange on a large baking sheet. Place 1 tablespoon mushroom mixture on each square. Top each square with 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese. Fold the squares into triangles.
In a small saucepan, melt remaining butter. Brush triangles with butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm.
