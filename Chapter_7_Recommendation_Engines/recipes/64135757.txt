Ingredients:
10 Slices thick cut peppered bacon
10 tsp brown sugar
1 tsp Maple extract
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 Eggs
1 tsp Maple extract
3/4 cup buttermilk
2 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 5.3 oz Vanilla Greek Yogurt
1/4 cup butter
4 oz cream cheese
1 tsp Maple extract
2 cups confectioners sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Set aside.
Cut bacon length wise in half and then cut the bacon into small pieces. Place bacon in frying pan and add the brown sugar and the Maple extract. Cook on medium heat to desired crispiness. Bake in oven on 450 degrees if needed for extra crispiness. Separate 1/4 of the candied bacon into a separate bowl. Then set candied bacon aside.
In a large bowl, mix together sugar, oil, eggs, Maple and buttermilk. Stir in 3/4 of the candied bacon. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt; gently stir into candied bacon mixture. Stir in chopped nuts and yogurt. Spread batter into prepared pan.
Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine butter or margarine, cream cheese, maple extract, and confectioners sugar. Blend until creamy. Frost cake while still in the pan. Then garnish the top of the cake with the 1/4 remaining bacon.
