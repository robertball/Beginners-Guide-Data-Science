Ingredients:
4 cups torn fresh spinach
salt to taste
1 ½ cups shredded cooked chicken breast
2  green onions, thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) container nonfat sour cream
¼ cup plain nonfat yogurt
2 tablespoons whole wheat flour
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
½ cup 1% milk
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
6 (7 inch) whole wheat tortillas
½ cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add spinach and a splash of water. Season with salt and cook until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.
Mix chicken, spinach, and green onions together in a large bowl.
Combine sour cream, yogurt, flour, salt, and cumin in a medium bowl. Add milk and jalapeno. Mix well. Pour 1/2 the sauce into the chicken mixture. Divide filling among tortillas.
Roll tortillas up and place seam-side down into a large baking dish. Spoon remaining sour cream sauce over enchiladas.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.
