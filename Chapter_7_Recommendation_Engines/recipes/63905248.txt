Ingredients:
citrus peels

Directions:
Collect enough orange, lemon and/or grapefruit peels in a plastic bag in the freezer until you're ready to start - use juiced or handpeeled fruit and do NOT scratch off the inside white
In a large pot cover with cold water, bring to a boil and discard the water, REPEAT THIS TWICE MORE (i know it smells great, but this takes the bitterness out and enough aroma will be left).
Drain well and weigh.
Add the same amount of white sugar to the peels plus a little water and put back on stove.
Bring to a boil slowly and simmer at very low for about 1 hour until the peels are glazy.
Take out with a slotted spoon and put on dish towels or racks to dry - you might want to use a tray underneath to be able to carry all of it.
Put in a cool place and let dry for a few days, turning every day so it dries evenly.
The cooled cooking liquid will get syrupy and can be used like any syrup in cooking, very good!
Store in plastic containers or jars and chop just before using
