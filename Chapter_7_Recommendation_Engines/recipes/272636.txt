Ingredients:
1/3 stick butter
1 cup bread crumbs
4 tomatoes
1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced onion
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/3 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, or more if desired

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Stir in bread crumbs until butter is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
Slice off tops of tomatoes using a paring knife; make one long round incision in the centers to core. Stick a spoon in the cut and scoop out interior, reserving flesh, and leaving only the rinds.
Place 1/2 the scooped tomato flesh in a blender and pulverize to a liquid. Set aside 3 tablespoons to use; discard the rest.
Combine bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons reserved tomato pulp juice, 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, onion, basil, parsley, garlic powder, cayenne, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stuff mixture into cored tomatoes using a spoon. Place stuffed tomatoes on a baking sheet and tent with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese evenly on top of tomatoes. Return to oven and bake until cheese is melted and golden, about 10 minutes more.
