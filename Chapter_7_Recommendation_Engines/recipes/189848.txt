Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, cut into chunks
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter
1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish with butter or oil.
Place the sweet potato chunks into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Add the brown sugar, butter, condensed milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt to the mashed potato; beat with a wire whisk until fluffy. Crack the eggs into the bowl and continue whisking until the mixture is light in color; pour into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 90 minutes.
