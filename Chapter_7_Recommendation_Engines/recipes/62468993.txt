Ingredients:
9 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter
12 oz Premier White Chocolate chips
1/4 cup Light Corn Syrup
8 oz Sandies Pecan Shortbread cookies
2 Cups Mini Marshmallows
1/4 cup Grahams Cracker Crumbs

Directions:
In a heavy bottomed saucepan, melt the butter, corn-syrup and chocolate.  Scoop out 1/2 cup of the melted chocolate mixture and put to one side.
Put the cookies into a large freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin.  You need both crumbs and pieces of cookies.
Fold the cookie pieces and crumbs into the saucepan of melted chocolate, and add the marshmallows.  Mixing everything together.
Tip the mixture into a 9 inch square foil pan and flatten with a spatula.  Pour over the remaining chocolate mixture and smooth out the top.
Sprinkle the top with the Grahams cracker crumbs.
Refridgerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Cut into 24 fingers.
