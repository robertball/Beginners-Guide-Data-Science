Ingredients:
5 tablespoons butter
4 eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, salt, flour and milk. (Use a blender for this step, if desired.) Melt the butter in a 9x13 inch baking pan. Pour the contents of the mixing bowl into the pan.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until the mixture rises. Serve at once. Sprinkle lemon juice and powdered sugar on top at the table. Add fruit or whipped cream if desired.
