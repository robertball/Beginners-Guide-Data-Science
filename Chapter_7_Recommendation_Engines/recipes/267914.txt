Description: 
Hatch chiles and tomatillos take this white chili to another level. I like to make my own roasted salsa verde but you can always use jarred or canned. Cooked in the slow cooker for ease and convenience. Top with your choice of sliced avocados, shredded cheese, cilantro, or sour cream.
