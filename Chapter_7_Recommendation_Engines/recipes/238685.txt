Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 (10 ounce) package fresh spinach
6 large eggs, slightly beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons cream cheese, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add spinach to mushroom mixture and cook until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir eggs into mushroom-spinach mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cook, without stirring, until eggs start to firm; flip. Sprinkle cream cheese over egg mixture and cook until cream cheese starts to soften, about 5 minutes.
