1/4 cup cornstarch
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
4 large eggs - room temperature
2 large egg yolks
3/4 cup sugar
Pinch of salt
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract - divided
1 cup finely grated carrots

1/4 cup golden raisins - chopped
3 1/4 cups powdered sugar - divided
3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) butter - softened
1 1/2 cups cream cheese - softened

Directions:
Heat oven to 400.
Grease a 12x17 jelly roll pan and line with parchment paper, then grease and flour the parchment paper.
In a bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg.
In another bowl, beat on high speed, the eggs, yolks, granulated sugar, salt and 1 tsp. vanilla until light and fluffy - about 3 minutes.
Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture and mix about 1 minute or until just combined.
Stir in carrots, raisins and 1/2 cup of walnuts.
Pour batter into pan and distribute evenly.
Bake 10 minutes or until done.
Lightly dust a cotton tea towel (not terry cloth) with 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.
Remove warm cake from pan onto tea towel and slowly peel off parchment.
Starting on long side, carefully roll cake and towel together.
Cool cake completely, seam side down.
For filling, beat butter until smooth then add cream cheese, mascarpone and remaining vanilla and mix until smooth.
Add remaining powdered sugar and beat until smooth.
Unroll cooled cake and spread 2 cups of frosting over it.
Re-roll cake and place seam side down on a platter.
Spread remaining frosting over cake and sprinkle walnuts on top.
