1 Cup Frank’s cayenne pepper sauce
1/3 Cup vegetable oil
1 Teaspoon granulated sugar
1 Teaspoon garlic powder

2 Teaspoons cornstarch

Directions:
Combine first seven ingredients for the sauce your choice in a small saucepan. Heat sauce over medium heat until boiling, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow it to cool, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
While the sauce cools, whisk egg yolk with 2 teaspoons water in a medium bowl until pale yellow. Whisk in cornstarch until dissolved.
Drizzle the hot sauce mixture into the egg yolk mixture in a steady stream while rapidly whisking. Cover the sauce and chill until ready to serve.
