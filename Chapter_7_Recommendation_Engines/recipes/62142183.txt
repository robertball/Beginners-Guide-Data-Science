Ingredients:
1/2 cup sourdough starter
1 cup water
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup amaranth flour
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
2 T. honey
1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
cornmeal

Directions:
Combine sourdough starter with water and 1 cup whole wheat flour. Stir thoroughly, cover with cloth.  Let sit 7-24 hours.
After sitting, add the other 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and honey.  Add all-purpose flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough loses stickiness.
Knead lightly, roll out to 1/2" thickness.  Cut with 2 1/2" biscuit cutter. Place rounds on pan sprinkled with cornmeal.
Sprinkle tops with cornmeal.  Cover with clean towel for about 45 minutes.
Heat skillet on medium heat.  Spray skillet if your pan is non-stick. Place rounds on, turning heat to medium low.  Cook for 6 minutes per side. They should be light to medium brown, with sides looking dried out. Flip rounds.
Cool thoroughly. Best if refrigerated or frozen for storage in sealed container.
To eat an English muffin, pierce sides with fork all the way around the round; pull apart.  Toast in toaster or under the broiler.
