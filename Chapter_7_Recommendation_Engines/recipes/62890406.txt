Ingredients:
4 large russet or Kennebeck potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch fries
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 Tablespoons salt
2 quarts peanut oil

Directions:
1.Cut your potatoes into 1/4 square strips. It is important to get a regular size as they will cook differently if they are of different thicknesses. Combine the vingar salt and 2 quarts of water into a large saucepan and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and boil for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and put them on a cookie sheet to cool for 5 minutes.
2. Heat the oil to 400 degrees. Put an amount of fries in the oil so that they are loose and have plenty of oil around them dont crowd the oiler, do it in batches if necessary. Cook for 50 seconds and remove and place on paper towels to cool for 30 minutes at least. At this point the fries can be frozen and kept for later. This actually makes them better, but you can go right ahead and cook again if you need to, just make sure to cook them to room temperature first.
3. Cook again in 400 degree oil for 3 1/2 minutes. DON'T try to combine steps 2 and 3. They need to cool in between to get a good crispy skin! Remove and dry on paper towels, salt to taste.

Description: 
If you are like me the first time you made french fries you chopped up some potatoes and tossed them in the hot oil. They came out soggy and no where near as good as I would like. I did some research and found out properly made french fires are cooked 3 times! This takes quite a bit longer , but you get a fry that will stand up to McDonalds any day of the week.
