Ingredients:
2 dried red chiles, stemmed and seeded
1 cup fresh grated coconut
1 cup rice flour
1/2 cup gram flour (chickpea flour)
1 tablespoon tamarind, or as needed
4 tablespoons coriander seeds
1 tablespoon skinned split black lentils (urad dal)
1 tablespoon asafoetida powder
1 medium head cabbage, shredded
1 pinch salt to taste
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste
oil for frying

Directions:
Heat a heavy pan over medium-high heat. Place chiles in the pan and toast, turning often, until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer toasted chiles to a blender.
Add coconut, rice flour, gram flour, and tamarind to the blender with the chiles and process to a fine paste. Add a small amount of water if necessary.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over high heat. Add coriander, urad dal, and asafoetida; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Transfer this mixture to the tamarind mixture in the blender. Blend to combine.
Place shredded cabbage in a large bowl and add tamarind-coriander paste. Stir to combine; season with salt and sugar.
Heat oil for frying in a large heavy skillet. Spread small portions of cabbage mixture in the hot pan and fry patties until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
Cabbage can sometimes be boring to work with, so here is a recipe which gives a flavorful twist to the otherwise boring cabbage. 
This is a recipe from coastal India for pan-fried cabbage patties, where coconut is found in abundance. Passed on from my grandmother, this recipe uses fresh Indian spices and ingredients. Serve with Indian rice or naan bread.
