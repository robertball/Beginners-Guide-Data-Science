Ingredients:
1 1/2 quarts fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 pint heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (10 inch) angel food cake, cut in cubes
1/2 quart fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced

Directions:
Mix 1 1/2 quarts strawberries and white sugar in a large bowl; gently mash strawberries with a potato masher. Cover and refrigerate.
Beat cream cheese in a bowl until light and fluffy; set aside. Beat heavy cream in another bowl until soft peaks form; add whipped cream cheese and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Beat confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture.
Layer about half the angel food cake in a large bowl or trifle. Spread a third of the cream cheese mixture over the cake and top with a layer of mashed strawberries. Repeat the layers, finishing with a final layer of the cream cheese mixture. Arrange the remaining 1/2 quart strawberry slices decoratively. Chill until ready to serve.

Description: 
I cheat and use prepackaged angel food cake, but I absolutely, always, use fresh fruit and make the whipped cheesecake cream myself. I use a cream cheese whipped cream so that I stays looking nice when it has to sit around on a buffet for a few hours. Since the cream cheese gives it stability you can use WAY less sugar than traditional whipped cream calls for.
