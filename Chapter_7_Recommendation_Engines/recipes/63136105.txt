Ingredients:
8-10 oz. pasta of choice
extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
1 (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach or Kale (rough chopped)
8 oz. fresh mushrooms, your choice, thick sliced
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 medium vadalia onion, sliced
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
3 Roma tomatoes, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
8 oz. of kalamata olives, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil.
While it comes to a boil, chopped the veggies and put on a plate for easy of adding later.
Cook the pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until the tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and set aside.
While pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir the onion slightly and add red bell pepper.  When pepper is soft, add mushrooms until they give off their liquid, about 10 minutes. Add the red wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil. Stir in the tomatoes, spinach or kale, basil, parsley, and olives into the boiling mixture; continue cooking and stirring, until the flavors blend, about 10 more minutes.
Mix the cooked pasta into the veggies and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer the pasta and sauce until the flavors have blended, 8 to 10 minutes.
