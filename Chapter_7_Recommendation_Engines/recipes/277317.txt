Description: 
My husband makes some of the best breakfast sausage I've ever had, and he was gracious enough to share the seasoning recipe! He doesn't make it too sweet on purpose--because I usually drench the sausage patties with maple syrup anyway--so if you prefer a sweeter variation, you could always add more brown sugar to taste. This seasoning amount is enough for 1 pound of ground pork.
