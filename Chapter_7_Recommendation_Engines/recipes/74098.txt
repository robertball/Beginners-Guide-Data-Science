Ingredients:
1 large zucchini, finely chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup freshly grated Romano cheese
1 cup 2% milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
onion powder to taste
dried parsley (optional)
1/4 cup vegetable shortening

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the zucchini, onion, eggs, Romano cheese, milk, and flour. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley.
Heat about 1 tablespoon of shortening in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop 1/4 cupfuls of the batter into the skillet, and flatten slightly with the back of a spatula. Turn fritters over when the center appears dry. Cook on the other side until golden brown. Set aside and keep warm. Add more shortening to skillet as needed, and continue with remaining batter.
