Ingredients:
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 apple, peeled, cored, and diced
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, plus more for garnish
8 eggs
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup Mott'sÂ® Natural Applesauce
1/3 cup arrowroot flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
Maple syrup, for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Put butter and apples in 11x13 glass baking dish. Bake until butter and apples begin to melt and brown (about 5 minutes). Remove from oven and set aside.
Place eggs in a blender and pulse until smooth; add coconut milk, applesauce, arrowroot powder, almond flour, vanilla, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and sea salt. Blend until smooth, 45 to 60 seconds.
Carefully pour batter over browned butter-apple mixture in the casserole dish.
Bake until pancake is set in the middle and edges are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Dust with cinnamon before serving, if desired.
