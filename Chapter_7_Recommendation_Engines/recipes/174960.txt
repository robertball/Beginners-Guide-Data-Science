Ingredients:
1 ½ cups chicken broth
½ cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
¾ teaspoon ground ginger
¾ teaspoon brown sugar
¼ cup cornstarch
1 ½ teaspoons ground ginger
¼ teaspoon curry powder
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into cubes
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3  green onions, chopped
1  bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
½ cup cashews

Directions:
Whisk together the chicken broth, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger, and brown sugar in a bowl.
Combine 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger, and curry powder in a large, sealable plastic bag and shake to mix. Add the chicken to the bag and toss until well coated.
Heat the olive oil and sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Cook and stir the chicken in the hot oil until golden brown,  3 to 5 minutes. Add the green onions and bell pepper to the pan, cooking another 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the sauce mixture into the chicken and vegetable mixture; reduce heat to medium. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the dish and bring to a boil; allow to boil until the sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add cashews and toss to serve.

Description: 
Inspired by some other stir-fry experiments, this is an attempt to recreate a Chinese takeout favorite from a restaurant I no longer live close to. Other veggies can be added as you like.
