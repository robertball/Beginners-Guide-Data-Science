Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place the green beans in a saucepan with a lid and pour enough water over the beans to cover; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cover; simmer until the beans are tender but still crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain. Spread the beans onto paper towels to dry.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat; stir the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese into the melted butter. Reduce heat to low; add the beans and cook and stir until the beans are heated through and the crumbs are beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the parsley over the mixture to serve.
