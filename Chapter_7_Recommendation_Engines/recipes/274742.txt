Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup palm sugar
1/3 cup fish sauce
1/4 cup Sriracha sauce
1/4 cup tamarind concentrate
1/4 cup sesame oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons grated ginger
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 (8 ounce) package dried Thai rice noodles

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, palm sugar, fish sauce, Sriracha sauce, tamarind concentrate, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and cayenne pepper in a large zip-top bag. Add chicken and marinate in a refrigerator, 3 to 4 hours, or overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from bag, reserving marinade. Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink inside and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes.
Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes.
Pour reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook sauce until reduced, 4 to 5 minutes.
Slice grilled chicken and place over noodles. Top with sauce as desired.
