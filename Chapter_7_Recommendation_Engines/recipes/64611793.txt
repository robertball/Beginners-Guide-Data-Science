Ingredients:
2 cups pumpkin puree
2 cups nonfat plain Greek yogurt
2 eggs
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 muffin tins with cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, yogurt, eggs, oil and vanilla. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves and salt. Slowly combine the dry ingredients into the bowl with the wet ingredients, using a mixer. Mix ingredients until just incorporated, about 1 to 2 minutes. Scoop 1/4 cup batter into each muffin well. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until muffins spring back when pressed lightly on top and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted.
