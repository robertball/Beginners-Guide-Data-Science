Ingredients:
1.5 cups whole grain polenta
1 cup whole grain buckwheat flour
3.5 cups water
1 cup vegetable broth
1 tsp salt
1/4 butter, room temperature
6 ounces Taleggio DOP, room temperature
1 large head of radicchio
1 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Whisk together the cornmeal and buckwheat flour.
Bring to a boil in a large pot the water, broth, and salt. Sprinkle the polenta mixture into the water little by little, whisking constantly to avoid clumping. Immediately reduce the heat and simmer, stirring often to avoid burning.
Cut the butter and Taleggio into cubes, remove and discard the crust from the cheese. Reserve 4 cubes of cheese. Add the butter and remaining taleggio to the polenta. Stir often.
Heat a griddle or skillet. Remove the outer leaves of the radicchio and cut the head into four equal wedges. Drizzle the oil onto the griddle and cook the radicchio on each side until heated and slightly charred, when just beginning to wilt.
The polenta is ready when it is thick and creamy like grits. Distribute equal portions onto plates and top with a cube of Taleggio and a wedge of grilled radicchio. Serve immediately.
