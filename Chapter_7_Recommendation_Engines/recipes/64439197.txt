Ingredients
4 whole salmon fillets
3 tsp Montana Mex Chile Sea Salt
2 tbsp TFM Coconut Oil
1 ea yellow, green, and red bell pepper
1 medium sweet onion, cut in half then sliced into thin rings
1/2 c Slow Press Chardonnay
1 c fresh pineapple, cut into medium sized chunks
1 1/2 c Stonewall Kitchen Sesame Ginger Teriyaki Sauce

Directions:
Heat a deep saut√© pan over medium high heat for 2 minutes. While pan heats, season salmon generously with Montana Mex Chile Sea Salt. Add coconut oil to pan and allow to melt. Place salmon in pan flesh side down and sear 3-5 minutes until a nice brown crust has formed.  Flip and continue to cook an additional 3-5 minutes or until desired level of doneness.  Remove from pan and set aside on a plate covered loosely with foil. In the same pan, add bell peppers and onion, and stir fry until lightly browned and fragrant, about 5-8 minutes. Take pan away from heat and add the Slow Press Chardonnay, using a wooden spoon to scape up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Bring to a simmer to reduce wine, about 3-5 minutes. Add Stonewall Kitchen Sesame Ginger Teriyaki Sauce and stir to coat all veggies. Bring to a simmer and cook until heated, about 3 minutes. To serve, spoon a bed of cooked rice (if using) on a large serving platter.  Pour vegetable mixture and top with rested salmon. Serve with cooked white or wild rice for a complete meal.
