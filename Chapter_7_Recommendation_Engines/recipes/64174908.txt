Ingredients:
4 Tbs Coconut Oil
3 Tbs Petroleum Jelly or shea butter
1 Tbs Beeswax, shaved
1/4 teaspoon Kool-aid powder, ( I like orange, cherry, lemon and fruit punch)
A small container re-purposed.

Directions:
Melt the ingredients completely in a ziplock bag in hot water bath.  DO NOT MICROWAVE - it heats unevenly and you may get a nasty burn. Squeeze in to containers and cool. Decorate outside of container as desired.

Description: 
I have so many food and cosmetic allergies, so I went looking for a way to make my own lip gloss.  This is a variation of a recipe I found on line.
