In medium bowl, beat egg yolks on high speed until thick and lemon colored, about 5 minutes.  Add softened cream cheese. Beginning on low speed and increasing to high, beat until smooth.
In large mixing bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt until foamy. Add 1/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, beating constantly until sugar is dissolved and whites stand in soft peaks. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the cheese mixture, then fold the lightened cheese mixture back into the remaining egg whites. finally, fold in the thawed whipped topping.
Puree raspberries in a blender or press through a sieve. Spread half of fluffy cheese filling into the cooled crust. Pour half of the raspberry puree over the filling and swirl it in with a knife. Repeat with remaining filling and raspberry puree. Freeze until firm.
