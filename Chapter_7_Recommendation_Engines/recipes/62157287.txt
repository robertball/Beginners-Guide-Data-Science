Ingredients:
10 dried Chiles de Arbol with stems removed (usually found in mexican markets)
2 large tomatoes
1 small garlic clove
1/4 of a small white onion
1/2 oz of fresh chopped cilantro
1/2 tsp cooking oil
Salt to taste

Directions:
In a 3 quart sauce pan, core the tomatoes and boil them in water for 10 minutes, or until the flesh is peeling away and the tomato is tender.
In a frying pan, heat cooking oil until warm and place the chiles in the pan - do not burn them as they do so very quickly once the oil is hot.
Add the tomatoes, onion, garlic, chiles, and cilantro to your food processor.
Pulse it until the tomatoes are liquid, then turn on full until the chiles are ground and well blended into the salsa.
Taste the salsa and season with salt to your liking.
Add water and mix to desired consistency.

Description: 
Authentic Arbol chile salsa.  I like mine hot, but you can tone down the peppers if you wish.
