Description: 
This recipe comes from a dear friend of mine who's made his living as a sous chef on a luxury cruise line. When I asked him for a recipe for deep fried turkey, this is what he produced. Please remember to PAT THE TURKEY DRY before placing into hot oil. We don't want any injuries....just full tummies! Recipe is for brine for a 16-pound turkey.
