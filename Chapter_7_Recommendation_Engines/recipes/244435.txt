Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (11 ounce) package chocolate chips

Directions:
Line a 9x9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil.
Combine sweetened condensed milk and chocolate chips together in a microwave-safe bowl; melt in the microwave until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes. Stir until smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared pan.
Refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour. Lift fudge out of pan by pulling up by the foil. Flip fudge onto a work surface and cut into 12 to 16 pieces.
