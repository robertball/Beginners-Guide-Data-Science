Ingredients:
1 cup butter-flavored shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup butterscotch chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat shortening, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, and white sugar together in a bowl until creamy; add eggs and vanilla extract and beat until smooth.
Whisk flour, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until dough is well-mixed; slowly stir in oats. Stir butterscotch chips into dough until evenly distributed. Drop dough by the spoonful 2 inches apart onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I was in the mood for something sweet with pumpkin and butterscotch and I came up with these cookies. My husband and kids love them! These cookies are extra moist and following the recipe should give it a more cakey than crisp texture. If you are looking for a crispy oatmeal cookie, this is not it!
