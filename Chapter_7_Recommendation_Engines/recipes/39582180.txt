Ingredients:
2 C flour
1 t baking powder
1/4 t salt
4 T unsalted butter
1 C white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 t vanilla
1/4 t almond extract
3/4 c whole almonds with skins, toasted, cooled and coarsly chopped
1 large orange zested and minced to yield 2 T zest

Directions:
Sift first 3 ingred together in sm. bowl
Beat butter and sugar together until light and smooth; add eggs one at a time, then extracts. Stir in almonds and zest. Sift dry ingred. over egg mixture, then fold in until dough is just combined.
Heat oven to 350. Halve dough and turn each portion onto an oiled cookie sheet covered with parchment. Using floured hands, quickly stretch each portion of dough into a rough 13 x 2-in log, placing them about 3 inches apart on cookie sheet. Pat each dough shape to smooth it. Bake, turning pan once, until loaves are golden and just beginning to crack on top, about 35 min.
Cool loaves for 10 min; lower oven temperature to 325. Cut each loaf diagonally into 3/8-in slices with a serrated knife. Lay the slices about 1/2-in apart on cookie sheep, cut side up. and return them to the oven. Bake, turning over each cooke halfway through baking, until crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 15 min. Transfer biscotti to wire rack and cool completely

Description: 
Uses small amount of butter producing richer, more cookie-like texture. Will keep at least 2 weeks in airtight container, but taste better if eaten same day as when baked
