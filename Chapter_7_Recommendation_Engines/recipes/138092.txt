1 (6 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and coarsely chopped
1/4 cup roasted garlic
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
8 ounces crumbled feta
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup half-and-half (optional)

Directions:
Place roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, oregano, and white pepper into a blender; puree until smooth. Add feta and cream cheese, and puree until smooth.
With blender running, slowly pour in olive oil until incorporated and thickened. Stir in half-and-half if needed to achieve a dip consistency. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
