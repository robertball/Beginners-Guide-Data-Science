Description: 
These tartines are assembled on long slices of crisply toasted baguette topped with a mash of garlic and herb Boursin®, cut with ricotta and goat cheese to make it spreadable. On top, chopped tomatoes, sweet and crunchy, with a drizzle of olive oil, basil, salt and pepper. I love these for lunch or even breakfast. Satisfying, but uncomplicated.
