1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons Dijon-style prepared mustard
1 teaspoon honey
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
3/4 cup shredded provolone cheese
3 ounces hard salami, diced

Directions:
In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente, rinse under cold water and drain.
Preheat oven broiler and place halved tomatoes on a sheet pan 6 inches from the broiler. Broil skin side up until the skin is wrinkled and partially blackened.
Place the tomatoes in a food processor and add the tomato paste, garlic, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, mustard and honey. Blend until smooth. With the processor running, add the olive oil and vegetable oil in a thin steady stream. Season with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, combine the tortellini, cheese, salami, celery, olives, bell pepper, onion, parsley, rosemary and lemon juice. Gently toss and drizzle with vinaigrette to coat. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Best served at room temperature.
