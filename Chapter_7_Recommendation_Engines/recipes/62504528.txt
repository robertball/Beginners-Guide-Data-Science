2 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 small turnip or rutabaga, peeled and diced
2 parsnips, peeled and diced
1 medium or 2 small butternut squash, peeled and diced

1 pkg cream cheese (250 gms)
3 cups milk
pinch of nutmeg
1 cup shredded parmesan cheese
2 - 3 tbsp melted butter
1 cup fine bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
You want just about 8 overflowing cups of chopped vegetables.  Bring vegetables and milk to boiling on medium high and lower to medium low, stirring several times until vegetables are fairly tender.  Add cream cheese and stir until cheese is melted and mix in parmesan cheese and nutmeg well.  Add salt and pepper as desired.  Pour into well greased casserole dish.
Mix melted butter with bread crumbs and spread over top.
Bake, covered  at 350 F and vegetable casserole is bubbling, approximately 30 minutes.  Remove cover and cook another 5 minutes or so to let top brown.    Let sit for two minutes prior to serving.

Description: 
As root vegetables now come to harvest, try this out.  These are the vegetables I used but I am sure everything can be altered to suite your individual tastes.  Collectively everything comes together and everything tastes GOOD even if you don't like parsnips or turnips, etc.
