Description: 
To make this recipe the most budget friendly it would be easiest to purchase a package of taco seasoning,  but then you would lose the home-made flavor of making your own.  So for this recipe I increased the amounts of seasoning and made a large batch that I have access to anytime I want to add a little or a lot of taco flavor to a dish.  Sounds crazy but I find cheap spices at my local drugstore (Walgreens, Bartells..etc)Modified from: Taco Seasoning I
