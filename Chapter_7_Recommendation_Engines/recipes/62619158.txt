12-oz of sliced Canadian bacon, slices cut into quarters

Directions:
Place hash brown patties in a single layer in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Create a layer of Canadian bacon, then sprinkle with cheese.
In a bowl, beat egg substitute, milk, salt and mustard. Pour over ham and cheese.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Uncover; bake 15 minutes longer or until edges are golden brown and a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.

Description: 
The original recipe is delicious, but this is my healthier version, with less fat and calories. It also freezes beautifully and individual portions can be reheated in 3 minutes in the microwave.Modified from: Wake-Up Casserole
