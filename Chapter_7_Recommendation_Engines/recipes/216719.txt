Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 onion, chopped
3 potatoes, diced
3 stalks celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups water
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1/2 head cabbage, finely chopped
1 (28 ounce) can whole tomatoes with basil, undrained and chopped
1/2 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion, potatoes, celery, and garlic in the melted butter until the onion and celery are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the water over the vegetable mixture; stir the chicken bouillon into the liquid until dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil; cook at a boil until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir the cabbage into the boiling liquid. Reduce heat to medium. Add the tomatoes with juices, ketchup, hot sauce, and Italian seasoning; stir to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer until the flavors have a chance to mix, about 15 minutes.
