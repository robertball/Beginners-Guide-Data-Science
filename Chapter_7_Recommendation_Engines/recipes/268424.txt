Ingredients:
1/2 pound raspberries
3 tablespoons white sugar, divided
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 cup amaretto liqueur
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
1 cup crushed amaretti
4 whole amaretti cookies

Directions:
Reserve 6 raspberries for garnish. Place remaining raspberries in a saucepan and add 2 tablespoons sugar, water, and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until raspberries break down, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl to remove seeds and reserve raspberry sauce.
Combine amaretto liqueur, heavy cream, and remaining sugar in a mixing bowl. Whip until soft peaks form. Add mascarpone cheese and blend thoroughly.
Place 1 or 2 tablespoons crushed amaretti in the bottom of a serving glass. Add whipped mascarpone mixture and a layer of raspberry sauce. Repeat layers and top with 1 reserved raspberry and 1 whole amaretti cookie. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
