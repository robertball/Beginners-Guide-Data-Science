Ingredients:
2-3/4 cups and 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup and 3 Tbsp shortening, chilled
1/2 Cup Butter, chilled
1/4 cup and 3 Tbsp tablespoons ice water

Directions:
Whisk the flour and salt together in a medium size bowl.  With a pastry blender, cut in the cold shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water over flour.  Toss mixture with a fork to moisten, adding more water a few drops at a time until the dough comes together.
Gently gather dough particles together into a ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling.
Roll out dough, and put in a pie plate.  Fill with desired filling and bake.
