Ingredients:
Vinaigrette:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
Salad:
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 1/2 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
1 cup farro
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 cup chopped tart green apple
3/4 cup dried cherries
2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Whisk oil, maple syrup, vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
Cook and stir walnuts in a small skillet over low heat until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
Bring chicken broth, farro, oregano, and basil to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, cover with a lid, and let sit until all the liquid has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Transfer farro to a glass bowl and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes more.
Mix walnuts, green apples, dried cherries, and parsley into farro. Drizzle dressing over farro mixture and toss to coat; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
