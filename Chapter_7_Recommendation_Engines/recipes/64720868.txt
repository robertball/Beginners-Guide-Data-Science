2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
1 large bunch of bok choy
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
1. Heat grill pan over medium heat.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger. Set aside.
3. PUll the leaves off the base of the bok choy and slice off the very bottom of the stem to remove any tough pieces. Wash the leaves individually and let them dry completely on a clean kitchen towel.
4. Brush individual bok choy leaves with soy mixure.
5. Grill leaves for about 30 to 45 seconds per side to wilt the bok choy and create grill marks on the stems and leaves.
6. Sprinkle grilled bok choy with sesame seeds and serve warm.
