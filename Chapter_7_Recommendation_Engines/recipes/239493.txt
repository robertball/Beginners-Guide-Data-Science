Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 large onion, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion until softened and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add jalapeno peppers to onion; cook and stir until onion is browned, about 10 minutes more. Transfer onion mixture to a plate.
Heat about 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet and add 1 tortilla. Top tortilla with 1/4 cup Mexican cheese blend, 1/2 of the onion mixture, and 1/4 cup Mexican cheese blend, respectively; top with 1 tortilla. Cook quesadilla until browned and cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining oil, tortillas, cheese, and onion mixture.

Description: 
This is great for an appetizer or meal. You can add meat if you like, but I made a vegetarian option for meatless Monday! Top each quesadilla with sour cream, salsa, lettuce, and guacamole.
