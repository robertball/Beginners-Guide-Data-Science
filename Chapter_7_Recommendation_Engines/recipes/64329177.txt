Ingredients:
4 medium-sized yukon gold potatoes
1/2 sweet onion
4 baby carrots
1 tsp ? Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon cornstarch,
1 cup of almond milk
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Cut up the potatoes and onion in big chunks, then toss them and the carrots in the seasonings. Roast in the oven for 40 minutes at 425 degrees. Then heat up the milk, water, and cornstarch (I think you could do without this) over medium heat. When the vegetables are done, put them in with the milk mixture and pureed with a stick blender. Then stir in a couple teaspoons of dried chives.
