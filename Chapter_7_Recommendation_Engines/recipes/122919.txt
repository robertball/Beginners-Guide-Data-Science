Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
2 eggs
1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
TOPPING:
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans
FILLING:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  Add eggs, sugar, butter, salt and vanilla; mix well.  Add 2 cups of flour; beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.
In a saucepan, combine brown sugar, honey, butter and salt; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Boil for 1 minute.  Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan; sprinkle with pecans.  Set aside.  Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; roll into a 24-in. x 8-in. rectangle; brush with butter to within 1 in of edges.  Combine the pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over butter.  Roll up from long side; seal seam.  Cut into 1-in. slices; place cut side down in pan.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-28 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool 1 minute; invert onto a serving platter.
