Ingredients:
1 pound dried red beans
2 quarts hot water
1 pound smoked turkey sausage, cut into chunks
1 cup finely chopped onions
1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Put red beans in a large pot with enough water to cover by several inches. Soak 8 hours to overnight.
Drain and rinse beans. Pour hot water into the pot. Add beans, sausage, onions, bell pepper, celery, cayenne pepper, salt, and bay leaf to the pot; stir. Place pot over medium heat, put a cover on the pot, and cook, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking at a simmer until the beans are tender, about 30 minutes more. Remove and discard bay leaf before serving.

Description: 
If you want real Cajun, you have to try red beans and rice. Often, this simple dish is loaded with fat and sodium. Try this reworked recipe that everyone loves! No one will ever know it's the 'healthy' version!
