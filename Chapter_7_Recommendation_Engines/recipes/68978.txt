Ingredients:
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 small white onion, grated
1 stalk celery, grated
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
2 quarts half-and-half cream
1 pint heavy cream
1 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 pound lump crabmeat
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1/2 cup sherry wine

Directions:
Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Stir in flour to make a smooth paste, and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Mix in the onion, celery, and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook and stir for about 4 minutes.
Gradually whisk in the half and half cream so that no lumps form. Stir in chicken broth and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer, and pour in half of the sherry. Season with dill, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until soup has reduced by 1/3. Add crabmeat, and simmer for another 10 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls, and top off with a splash of the remaining sherry and a sprinkle of fresh chives.
