Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large yellow onions, diced
6 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
4 carrots, sliced 1/8-inch thick
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
46 ounces low-sodium vegetable juice (such as V8Â®)
46 ounces reduced-sodium beef broth
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
2 cubes beef bouillon
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
1 (15.25 ounce) can yellow corn, drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can great Northern beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can cut green beans, drained
8 ounces frozen peas
8 ounces frozen lima beans
8 ounces frozen sliced okra

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, and carrots until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir garlic into onion mixture; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove pot from heat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in batches in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer browned beef to onion mixture in the large pot using a slotted spoon.
Heat onion-beef mixture over medium heat. Stir vegetable juice, beef broth, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, beef bouillon, thyme, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer to blend the flavors, at least 1 hour.
Stir corn, kidney beans, cannellini beans, great Northern beans, green beans, peas, lima beans, and okra into beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes.
