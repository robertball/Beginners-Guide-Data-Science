Description: 
A massively underrated summer dessert, semifreddo has a rich taste, and you get what's basically an airy, custard-style ice cream without having to use a machine. However, it all comes at a cost. The classic procedure is a little bothersome, since you need to make three separate components – a zabaione, a meringue, and whipped cream – so, I decided to simply use the eggs whole, and make a 'zabaringue.' I knew I wouldn't get as much volume, but I didn't care.
