Ingredients:
1 lg. can B&M; brand barbecue flavor beans
1 lg. can Hunt's brand chili beans
1 lg. can pork & beans in tomato sauce
1 lg. can pinto beans
4 oz. molasses
2 Tbls. liquid smoke
2 Tbls. Worcestershire sauce
pinch of salt, to taste
pinch of black pepper, to taste
1 c. brown sugar, packed
3 T. dried mustard
1 c. barbecue sauce, any kind - use your favorite
1 large onion, chopped
garlic powder, to taste
1 lb. ham, diced (turkey ham or Spam may be substituted)
4 to 8 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Pour all of the beans into a large, deep pan (disposable aluminum pans are great for this). Rinse the cans with a little water and add to the beans for extra moisture.
Add all the other ingredients, except the bacon, to the beans and mix to combine.
Place the bacon slices on top.
Bake for approximately 3 hours, making sure to check every so often to make sure that the beans are not drying out. If it seems that they are, add a little water and remove from the oven. The sauce will thicken as the beans set.
Serve with any grilled meats of choice.

Description: 
My dad got this recipe from a family friend decades ago and it was THE staple side dish during the summer, served along side grilled meats. Personally, I like to experiment with the beans by adding different types (red kidney, garbanzo, etc.). When mom made these beans, she always used Spam...which, alone is kind of awful, but works very well in this recipe!
