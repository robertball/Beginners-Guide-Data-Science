Description: 
A gorgeous, Italian style heart warming soup made with tomatoes, potatoes, spaghetti and the special secret ingredient....marrow from a marrow bone. Both myself and my brother have been brought up with this delicious soup, and I have made it ever since. Marrow bones are available from your butcher very cheaply, sometimes even for free. If the bone is very large, ask your butcher to cut it in half for you, so it will fit into the pot comfortably. You can use a can of cannellini beans if you prefer. Serve this soup with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
