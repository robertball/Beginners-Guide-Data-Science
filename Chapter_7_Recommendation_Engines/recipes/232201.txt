Ingredients:
4 cloves garlic
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 bay leaves
1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
6 whole black peppercorns
4 pods green cardamom
4 whole cloves
1 large onion, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 green chile pepper, cut into matchsticks
2 tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup water, if needed (optional)
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon ground fenugreek (menthi powder)
1 russet potato, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 pound paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 cup frozen peas
2 teaspoons honey

Directions:
Place garlic and ginger in a blender or food processor; puree until smooth.
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir bay leaves, cinnamon stick, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cardamom pods, and cloves in hot oil until spices change color and become fragrant, 1 to 2  minutes. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir garlic-ginger puree and green chile pepper into onion mixture; cook and stir until chile pepper is tender, 1 to 2 minutes more. Stir in tomatoes. If mixture becomes too thick, add water. Season with chili powder and cumin. Remove tomato mixture from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.
Transfer mixture to the blender or food processor; puree until smooth. Pour sauce into a saucepan and add butter and fenugreek.
Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and stir in potatoes. Simmer until potatoes are nearly tender, 10 to 15 minutes; add paneer and frozen peas. Continue to simmer until potatoes and peas are tender, about 5 minutes more. Stir in honey and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
