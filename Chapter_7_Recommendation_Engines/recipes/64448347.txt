1/4 cup margarine
1/4 cup flour
1 cup milk (dairy or non)
2/3 cup mayonaise
3 tablespoons chopped onion
3 eggs well beaten
1/2 cup cheddar cheese, grated
dash of salt and pepper

Directions:
Cook the broccoli and drain.
Chop the onion and set aside.
Beat the eggs and set aside.
Make the white sauce: melt margarine in a saucepan. Add flour and stir until mixed.  Slowly add the milk, stirring to prevent lumps. Cook until thick.
Combine the white sauce immediately with all other ingredients (except the cheese) into a casserole dish and mix together.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese on top and bake another 15 minutes or until set.
