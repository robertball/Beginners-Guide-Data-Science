Ingredients:
8 cups riced russet potatoes (approximately 5 lbs.)
1 cup half and half
1 cup butter
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons salt
3 1/2-4 cups flour

Directions:
Mix first five if the above ingredients:
Cover with cloth and refrigerate overnight.
The next day when ready to start rolling mix in flour. Some potatoes have more water in them so you may need more flour.
Roll the mixture into fist sized balls (3 1/2 to 4 oz.).  Store them in the refrigerator - remove as you roll. Roll the lefse on a well floured board covered with a pastry cloth using a grooved rolling pin with a lefse sock on it. If ball is too moist use more flour on the cloth.
Bake lefse on grill heated to 475 to 500 degrees. A cool grill causes dry lefse. This batch makes approximately 24 circles of lefse.
