Ingredients:
2  15.5-ounce cans chickpeas, rinsed, patted dry
4  garlic cloves, crushed
? cup olive oil
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
splash lemon juice
2½ cups chopped mixed tender herbs (such as parsley, cilantro, chives, and/or basil)

Directions:
Place chickpeas in a large skillet or Dutch oven and add garlic and oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are crisped and some have split open (these will be the most delicious ones), 10–15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in herbs. They DO turn quickly, so keep an eye on them during last 5-10 minutes.
Add some lemon juice once the chickpeas are nice and toasty.
