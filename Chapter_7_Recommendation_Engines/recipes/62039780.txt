Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1 tsp white vinegar
dash of salt
1/2 tsp almond extract
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup sugar
food coloring of choice

Directions:
Beat egg whites with vinegar and salt until doubled in volume, beat in almond and vanilla extracts.  Sprinkle in sugar very slowly 1 tbsp at a time, beating until sugar is dissolved and meringue stands in firm peaks.  Beating will take about 25 minutes in an electric beater.
Spoon half of mixture into a second bowl.  Blend in a few drops of food coloring.  Drop by tsp 1 1/2 inches apart on brown paper bag lined cookie sheets.  Sprinkle on colored sugar.  Bake slow oven 250 degrees 45 minutes or until crisp.  Remove from brown paper and place on wire rack.  Store in an airtight container.
NOTE: It is best to use a brown paper bag to line them onto.  You can get a paper bag at any store!
