Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey (99% fat free)
1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
4 tbsp chunky salsa (use medium or hot for extra kick)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients until well mixed.
Add salt & pepper to taste.
Divide into 4 patties.
Spray a frying pan with cooking spray and cook over medium heat until cooked thoroughly (about 10 minutes), flipping once about half-way through.
Chill the burgers and they stay together better on the grill. Freeze the uncooked leftovers and throw them on the grill frozen.
