Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed, divided
2 cups buttermilk
1 cup unfed sourdough starter
2 tablespoons butter, cubed
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Mix 3 cups all-purpose flour, buttermilk, sourdough starter, 2 tablespoons cubed butter, and white sugar in a glass bowl. Cover and set in a warm area until double in size, 8 to 12 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl. Add to flour mixture.
Knead dough until it is soft but no longer sticky, adding flour as needed. Roll dough with floured rolling pin until it is 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick.
Combine 6 tablespoons melted butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it has the consistency of a paste. Spread sugar paste evenly on rolled dough.
Roll up dough into a cylinder shape. Cut dough into 1/2-inch pieces using dental floss or a serrated knife. Arrange rolls into a cast iron skillet.
Bake cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
