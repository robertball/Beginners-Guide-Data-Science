Ingredients:
1 large cucumber coarsely chopped. (take seeds out if they are large)
1 large red bell pepper seeded and coarsely chopped
2 medium and 1 large home grown tomatoes coarsely chopped ( about 1 1/2 to 2 cups)
1/2 red onion diced
2 large garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup quality olive oil
1 teaspoon ground pepper
4 to 6 good sized fresh basil leaves chopped
1 Tbsp. chopped Italian parley leaves
1 1/2 cups spicy hot V8 juice
1 1/2 cups tomato juice

Directions:
Coarsely chop your vegetables and add to large bowl. Add all other ingredients as recipe calls for. Let sit for 20 minutes. Put in blender and pulse only long enough so you still have some small chunks of vegetables in your Gazpacho. Put in to a pitcher and chill refrigerator until cold and favors have had time to meld.
