Ingredients:
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
2 cups chopped walnuts
1 Tbsp flour
5 to 6 cups chicken stock
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup whipping cream

Directions:
Melt the butter in a 2 quart saucepan and slowly saute the walnuts for 10 minutes.
Add the flour, stir to coat the nuts and saute for another minute.
Slowly add the chicken stock to cover the nuts by about 1 inch and simmer for 90 minutes.
Let cool slightly, add 3/4 cups cream, then puree in a blender briefly, to maintain a nutty texture.
Reheat just before serving; do not boil.
Serve in bowls with a dollop of remaining unsweetened cream.
