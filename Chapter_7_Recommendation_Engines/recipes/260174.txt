Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 eggs, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
Ganache:
1/3 cup heavy cream
3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
Topping:
28 fresh raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup mini muffin pan and an 8-inch square pan with 1 teaspoon butter and 1 teaspoon flour each.
Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat; stir in sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth. Fold in 1 cup flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt gently.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups using a small ice cream scoop, filling each 3/4 full. Pour remaining batter into the square pan.
Bake both pans in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few crumbs attached, about 12 minutes for the mini muffins and 20 minutes for the square pan. Remove from oven and cool in the pan for 5 minutes.
Transfer round brownies to a wire rack to cool. Let 8-inch pan of brownies cool in the pan, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 small squares.
Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it almost boils, about 3 minutes.
Place chopped chocolate into a bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate and whisk until smooth. Cool until thickened, about 2 hours.
Place a dollop of ganache onto each brownie piece. Top each with 1 raspberry.

Description: 
My daughter wanted brownies with raspberries for her class as a treat for her birthday and since I did not want to make huge brownies for all the kids I came up with these mini desserts.
