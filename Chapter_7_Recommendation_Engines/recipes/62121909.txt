Ingredients:
13 frozen Ore-Ida hash brown patties (about 1 1/2 packages), thawed
1 can condensed Campbell's cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
16 oz. sour cream
1/2 c. onion, diced
3/4 t. salt, or to taste
1 t. coarse ground black pepper
2 t. minced garlic
1 1/2 c. grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 c. melted butter
2 c. corn flakes cereal

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the soup, sour cream, onion, salt, pepper, garlic, and cheddar cheese.
Crumble the hash browns over this mixture and fold together to combine. Mixture will be thick.
Spread mixture into a greased 9x13 baking dish.
In a small bowl crush the corn flakes to a texture you like. Stir in the melted butter until blended and spread/shake this mixture evenly over the hash brown mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until hot and bubbly all the way through. Let stand a couple of minutes to firm up a little.

Description: 
To hear him tell it, my husband was raised on this dish. After several years of marriage I finally asked my mom-in-law for the recipe. Wish I'd gotten it from her sooner! Hope you like it as much as we do.
