Melt butter over a low flame or, if you haven't discovered fire yet, in microwave on low.  Add butter, egg, and maple to the dry mixture.
Mix gently with a whisk or fork until all ingredients are blended.  Do not overmix!
Drop mixture one dollop at time onto either a greased baking sheet or, preferably, into a heavily greased mini cupcake/muffin sheet.  Bake in oven for exactly 9 minutes and 53 seconds.
Remove bites from oven and let cool for 5 - 10 minutes.
Gather bites from the sheet and arrange on a plate.  Add cocoa and/or powdered sugar and serve while still hot.
