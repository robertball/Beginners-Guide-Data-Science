Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
1 (6 ounce) can water-packed tuna, drained and flaked
2/3 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
2/3 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/4 cup sliced radishes
2 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine tuna, bell pepper, celery, carrot, radishes, green onions, and parsley in a large bowl.
Drain macaroni and rinse in cold water. Drain again and add to the bowl with the tuna mixture.
Combine mayonnaise, ranch dressing, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.

Description: 
A delicious pasta salad that tastes great with all the veggies in it. I substitute canned shrimp in place of canned tuna if I want to change it up a bit.
