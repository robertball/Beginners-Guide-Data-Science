Ingredients:
1/2 cup light olive oil
1 1/2 cup evaporated cane juice crystals
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
3 cups shredded zucchini
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
Frosting:  6 Tbsp cocoa powder
1/4 cup butter
2 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
For brownies mix oil, sugar and vanilla  well.  Combine flour, cocoa, soda, & salt and then stir into sugar mixture.  Fold in zucchini and nuts (if using).  Spread in 13x9 greased and floured pan.  (I just lightly spray a glass dish)  Bake 30 minutes at 350*.  Brownies will spring back when gently touched.
Frosting:  Melt cocoa and butter.  Set aside to cool.  Blend together powdered sugar, milk and vanilla.  Stir in cocoa mix and spread over cooled brownies.
