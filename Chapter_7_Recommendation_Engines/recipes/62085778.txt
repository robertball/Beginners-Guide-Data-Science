Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1/2 cup cocoa
1 tsp salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 tsp vanilla
2 1/2 cups oatmeal

Directions:
Cover a kitchen surface with wax paper before you begin. In a large saucepan, mix together the first three ingredients until well blended.  Add the milk all at once, stirring until combined.  Add the margarine and cook, constantly stirring, over medium heat until it comes to a rolling boil.  Cook without stirring for 2 1/2 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter and vanilla.  After the peanut butter melts, stir in the oatmeal.  Working quickly, drop heaping tablespoons onto wax paper.  Allow to cool.

My mom has cooked these no-bake cookies for as long as I can remember.  No other recipe provides such a rich, fudgy treat.  Have a glass of milk handy!
