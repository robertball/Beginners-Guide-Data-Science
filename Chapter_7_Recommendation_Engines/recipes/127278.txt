Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, divided
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, slightly softened
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon CALUMET Baking Powder
2 cups chopped PLANTERS Walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coarsely chop 8 of the chocolate squares; set aside. Microwave remaining 8 chocolate squares in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 min., stirring after 1 min. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla; stir until well blended. Add flour and baking powder; mix well. Stir in chopped chocolate and walnuts. (Note: If omitting nuts, increase flour to 3/4 cup to prevent excessive spreading of cookies as they bake.)
Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough, 2 inches apart, onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake 12 to 13 min. or until cookies are puffed and shiny. Cool 1 min.; remove from baking sheets to wire racks. Cool completely.
