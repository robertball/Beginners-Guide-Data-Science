Ingredients:
2 Tbs butter plus 1/4 cup divided
2 cups rotisserie chicken shredded
Onion
2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese or cheese of your choice
1 fresh jalapeno diced ( optional)
1/4 red bell pepper (optional)
8 flour or corn tortillas ( your choice)
1/4 flour
3 cups homemade chicken broth or canned chicken broth
1 cup sour cream
6 oz canned green chilies
2 cups shredded pepper jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
In a skillet  saute the onion, bell pepper and jalapeno (if using) in butter until translucent.
Add the shredded chicken until heated through.  Remove from heat
(If using corn tortillas place between two damp paper towels and microwave for 30 seconds so they don't tear while rolling.)
Place 3 Tbs of the chicken and some cheese down the center of each tortilla and roll.  Place seam side down in a baking dish.
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet over medium heat and add the flour and cook stirring constantly for one minute. Add the chicken broth slowly while stirring  and cook until slightly thickened.  Once thickened, remove from heat and add the green chilis and the sour cream. Pour over the enchiladas and top with remaining cheese.
Bake uncovered at 350 for 25 minutes until warm through and slightly brown on top.

I whipped this up one night with ingredients I had already.  My family loved these.  There are many layers of flavors and this is so easy to put together on a weeknight.
