Ingredients:
1 sleeve graham crackers (about 10 - enough to cover your baking sheet)
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 finely chopped walnuts*

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line a baking sheet with foil and grease very lightly with vegetable oil (just 2 or 3 drops) or cooking spray.
Break graham crackers into rectangles and arrange on foil-lined baking sheet.
In small saucepan, combine brown sugar and butter over medium heat.  Bring to boil.  Boil about three minutes, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens.
Pour mixture over graham crackers and sprinkle with nuts*.
Bake at 350 for about 10 minutes (watch carefully so they do not burn)
Cool 3 minutes and remove to baking rack to cool completely.
*You can omit the nuts and use graham cracker crumbs, if desired.

Description: 
Our family friend, Hilda, often brought over a plate of her various cookies, often for no other reason than she felt like baking that day.  We loved her authentic Swedish recipes, but these tasty, toffee-glazed graham crackers disappeared first!  It's amazing how four simple ingredients can be transformed into a delicious treat!
