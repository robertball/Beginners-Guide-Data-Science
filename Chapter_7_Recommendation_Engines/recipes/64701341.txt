Description: 
You don't have to eat the giblets to make a great tasting gravy.  They are used mainly for the flavor.  My Mom (I am in my 60's!) would add the chopped giblets and a couple of chopped boiled eggs to the gravy. You don't have to eat the giblets to make a great tasting gravy.  They are used mainly for the flavor.
