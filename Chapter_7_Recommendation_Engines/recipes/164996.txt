Ingredients:
4 (6 inch) MissionÂ® Fajita Flour Tortillas
1 pound lean ground sirloin
salt to taste
pepper to taste
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 red tomato, cut into 1/4-inch slices
2 leaves green leaf lettuce, small leaves
1 large red onion, 1/4-inch slices pulled into rings
12 dill pickle slices

Directions:
Separate ground beef into 4 equal parts (4 ounces each); form each part into 4 thin half moon shape patties.  Try to shape each patty to fill half of a tortilla.
Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet (or use a square, deep-walled non-stick electric skillet) over medium high heat.
Season each hamburger patty with salt and pepper and cook for 3 minutes a side or to your desired temperature.
Near the end of desired cooking time, evenly sprinkle each patty with 1/4 cup of Cheddar cheese and allow the cheese to melt.  Remove cheeseburgers and reserve hot.
Warm tortillas in a microwave for 10 seconds.
For 1 serving: Place a hot cheeseburger on one half of a warmed tortilla and top with 1 tomato slice,1 lettuce leaf, onion rings and 3 pickle slices.  Fold the tortilla in half and serve.
Repeat the build for the remaining 3 servings.
