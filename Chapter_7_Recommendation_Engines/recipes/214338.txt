Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 pkg. (8 serving size) JELL-O Strawberry Flavor Gelatin
1 cup cold water
1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries
1 (8 ounce) tub COOL WHIP Whipped Topping, thawed, divided

Directions:
Stir boiling water into dry gelatin mix in large bowl 2 minutes or until completely dissolved. Stir in cold water. Place strawberries in 6-cup mold; cover with 2 cups of the gelatin. Refrigerate 30 minutes or until gelatin is set but not firm (gelatin should stick to finger).
Meanwhile, refrigerate remaining gelatin 30 minutes or until slightly thickened (consistency of unbeaten egg whites). Add 2 cups of the whipped topping; stir with wire whisk until well blended. Spoon over gelatin layer in mold.
Refrigerate 4 hours or until firm. Unmold. Serve topped with remaining whipped topping. Store leftover gelatin in refrigerator.
