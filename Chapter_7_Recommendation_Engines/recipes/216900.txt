Ingredients:
cooking spray (optional)
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 (6 ounce) containers vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup half-and-half cream, or more if needed
1 cup bran cereal (such as Fiber One®), crushed
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup malitol brown sugar substitute (such as Sugar Twin®)
1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin tins with cooking spray.
Whisk the egg, oil, yogurt, and half-and-half together in a bowl until combined; stir the bran cereal and walnuts into the mixture. Mix the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar substitute, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl; add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and stir just until moistened. It's okay to add a little more half-and-half if the batter is too stiff. Fill each muffin cup about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Remove immediately to rack to cool.

Description: 
I like to optimize every carb or calorie I eat to be healthy as well as delicious.  This recipe combines bran and yogurt to make a really scrumptious muffin! These can also be made with fruit yogurt by leaving out the cinnamon and nutmeg and adding 1/2 cup fresh berries.
