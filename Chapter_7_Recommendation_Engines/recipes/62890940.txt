Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter (smooth or crunchy; either is fine)
1 egg
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp. baking soda
(optional: 1 tsp. vanilla extract)

Directions:
Mix ingredients in medium bowl until well blended.  Drop by spoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet and bake in oven at 350 degrees for about 10-12 minutes or until browned, yet with a slightly doughy center.  Allow cookies to cool on sheet before removing (otherwise they'll crumble).
