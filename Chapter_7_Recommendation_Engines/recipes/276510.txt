Description: 
Low and slow makes the best pulled pork, and here's a recipe to do it in your slow cooker! If you don't follow the keto way of eating, simply add the barbecue sauce of your choice and about 1/4 cup brown sugar to the rub. I used my barbecue recipe published on this site, because it has no sugar. We really enjoyed this. Serve with additional barbecue sauce, if desired.
