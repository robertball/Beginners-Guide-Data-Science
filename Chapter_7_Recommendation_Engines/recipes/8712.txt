Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 ½ cups finely chopped, cooked chicken meat
¼ cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons minced celery
1 tablespoon minced onion
¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 tablespoon shortening
½ cup milk
⅛ tablespoon poultry seasoning
½ cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs, for rolling

Directions:
Combine 1/3 cup of the soup, chicken, bread crumbs, celery, onion and 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning. Mix well and shape into 6 croquettes (I make patties). Chill in refrigerator for about 1 hour.
Remove croquettes from refrigerator and roll in additional bread crumbs. In a large skillet, melt 1 to 2 tablespoons shortening. Brown the croquettes in the shortening. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the remaining soup, milk and 1/8 teaspoon poultry seasoning. Heat over low, stirring occasionally. Serve sauce over croquettes.
