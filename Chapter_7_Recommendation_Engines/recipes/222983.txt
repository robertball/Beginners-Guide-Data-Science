Description: 
Decided to post this as I tried the 2 most popular banana puddings on the site, and didn't much care for either. So I combined them and was satisfied with the taste. A banana pudding base with cream cheese, condensed milk, whipped topping, and sour cream. Serve as you want with fresh bananas, whipped topping, and vanilla wafers.
