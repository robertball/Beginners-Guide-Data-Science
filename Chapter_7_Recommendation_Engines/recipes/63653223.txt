Description: 
The great thing about homemade burgers is that they can easily be modified accordingly, and these turkey burgers are great for those who are gluten intolerant, follow a gluten free diet, or simply wish to avoid breadcrumbs in their mixture without sacrificing taste or texture (like me).
