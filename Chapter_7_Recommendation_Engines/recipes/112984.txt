Ingredients:
3 pounds ground beef
1 cup raisins
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
6 hamburger buns

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium heat.
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, raisins, onion, garlic, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix lightly using your hands, then divide into 6 portions. Flatten each portion into a patty.
Place burgers on the grill and cook for about 7 minutes per side, or until well done. If you do not wish to grill, fry patties in a skillet over medium heat.  Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.

Description: 
A good way to spruce up the old hamburger for the family, with great flavor! For a cheese burger, I suggest either muenster, or provolone cheese to complete the taste.
