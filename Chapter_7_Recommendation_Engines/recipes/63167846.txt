Ingredients:
1 large yam, peeled and chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 cup carrots, chopped
3 cups/0.6 L vegetable broth
3 cups/0.6 L water
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 cup (250 grams) red lentils, rinsed

Directions:
In a large heavy saucepan, saute the onion for a few minutes over medium high heat.
Add carrot, yam, lentils, salt and curry powder, stir well.
Add broth and water, turn heat to high until the mixture reaches a boil.
Turn down heat and simmer for 30 minutes till potatoes and carrots are soft.
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, use a traditional blender and work in small batches.
If the soup is too thick for your liking, slowly add more warmed broth as you blend to reach desired consistency.
