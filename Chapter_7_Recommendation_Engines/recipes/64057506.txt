Description: 
This pancake recipe is my inspiration to encourage my 5-year boy to eat more fruits.

It is an excellent choice for kids that do not like fruits as they do not bite the shredded apple. Instead, they will love the natural sweetness. It also allows me to cut half of the sugar in a regular recipe. I even substitute the sugar maple syrup or brown sugar to add some varieties into this recipe. What way I do, my son will always says, Yum-yum!
