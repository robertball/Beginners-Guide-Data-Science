Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/3 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 loaf Italian bread, cut into 1-inch slices
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 cup water
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, green onion, bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; form into 1-inch meatballs. Arrange meatballs in a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Arrange bread slices in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine cream cheese, mayonnaise, Italian seasoning, and pepper in a bowl; spread over bread slices. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese over the cream cheese mixture.
Combine spaghetti sauce, water, and garlic in a bowl; add meatballs. Pour spaghetti sauce mixture over bread. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
