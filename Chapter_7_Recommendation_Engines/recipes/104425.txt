1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsweetened coconut cream
3 green chile peppers, chopped
4 fresh curry leaves
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 teaspoon saffron powder
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, salt, coconut cream, green chiles, curry leaves, cayenne pepper, saffron powder, garlic, and water in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the coconut cream thickens, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Test the potatoes for doneness by piercing them with the tip of a paring knife. When the potatoes are tender, remove the pan from the heat. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with plain rice.
