Ingredients:
1 c urad dal (split)
2 bay leaves
4 green cardamom pods or approx 3/4 tsp cardamom seed
1/8 tsp turmeric
1 c milk
1 c water
1 tsp salt
4 T ghee
1 c onions, sliced thin
1 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp ginger paste
8 whole cloves
3/4 tsp garam masala
3/4 tsp black pepper or cracked black peppercorns

Directions:
Soak urad dal in a bowl covered by 2" of water for 2 hours.
Drain and put in a saucepan to cook with the cardamom, bay leaves, turmeric, milk, water, and salt.
Cook over low heat, covered but vented, just simmering, for about an hour.  Stir as needed.  Don't let it stick or burn.  The beans should be quite firm still at the end of an hour.
Add another 1/2 c water, stir well.  Cover completely and cook another 15 to 20 mins, til the dal is soft and creamy.
Heat the ghee over med-high heat and add the onion, ginger, garlic, and cloves.  Fry, stirring constantly, til the onions begin to brown, about 15 mins.
Turn off heat and add the garam masala and pepper. Let fry another 15 secs or so then immediately pour over the dal mixture.
Stir to combine, serve with rice.
