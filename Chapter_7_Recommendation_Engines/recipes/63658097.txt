Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 cup wheat flour
1 T. buckwheat or dark rye flour (optional - and can be any interesting contrasting grain you'd like to add)
1 3/4 tsp. yeast
1 3/4 tsp. salt
3 T. Sugar (natural not refined)
3 T. Coconut Oil
1 cup warm water
1/3 cup sour cream
1 egg

Directions:
In a medium bowl stir together dry ingredients. Add remaining ingredients to bread machine then top with dry ingredients. Set machine on dough cycle and wait for the beep.
Pre-heat oven to just warm (but not too warm). Line cookie sheet with parchment paper. When dough is ready, deflate and gently form into a roll about 12-14 inches long. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Roll in the palm of your hand and pinch together at bottom to form equal sized balls. Place evenly on cookie sheet.
Let rise in warmed oven for about 20-30 minutes. Bake at 350 until golden brown, somewhere around 15-20 minutes. Cool rolls completely on rack, cut in half and make yourself a nice sandwich.
Can also make one loaf of bread.
