Ingredients:
1 package super firm tofu
1/4 cup Hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Remove tofu from packaging. Place about 4 paper towels on a plate. Set tofu on top of plate and cover with more paper towels. Place a cast iron pan or something else that is heavy on top. Let sit 30 minutes.
In a medium bowl, stir together Hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes.
Cut tofu into bite-sized pieces. Place in bowl with sauce and toss to coat. Let sit 30 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a medium cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Once really hot, add tofu. Once nicely seared on the bottom, flip over. Continue to cook until seared on bottom.
Drizzle with sesame oil and remove from heat.
Sprinkle with green onions and serve with rice.
