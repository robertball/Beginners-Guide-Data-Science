Description: 
This one is a salad that has a great combination of sweet and sour.  It is great with chicken or any simple entree. I am always trying to make up new, crazy, salads and this one has been a work in process for 10 years.  The fresh dill is not a necessity if you have a hard time finding it but if you do care to splurge on fresh herbs, it adds a great flavor!
