Ingredients:
1 Cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ginger powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup soft butter or butter-flavored shortening
1 egg
2/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup chopped dates tossed with 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon soft butter or margarine
2-3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Mix first 5 dry ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
In a larger bowl, cream butter with sugar for one minute. Add all remaining cake ingredients and blend together.  Add dry ingredients and mix until blended.  Fold in the dates and pour into a 9" greased pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until cake tests done. Turn on broiler in the oven and broil top of the cake until golden brown on top.
Invert onto a wire rack to cool slightly then flip back into the baking pan or onto a serving dish.
Whisk glaze ingredients adding enough milk to make a pourable, but not runny, glaze.  Using a large spoon, drizzle the glaze in a scribble pattern all over the top.  Allow glaze to set before cutting the cake.

Description: 
Delicious, moist cake that is perfect for breakfast.  I have also used diced, dried apricots instead of dates.  Adding some grated orange zest is another tasty variation that goes well with the dates.
