Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large sweet onion, diced
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/4 cup slivered almonds
3 (14.5 ounce) cans French-style green beans, drained
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in olive oil, then mix in onion, garlic, and almonds. Saute until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in green beans and season with salt and pepper. Cover skillet with lid and cook for 3 minutes, stirring a few times so mixture doesn't burn. Transfer mixture to a shallow dish and place in refrigerator to cool. When cool, pack into a resealable bag.
At campsite, heat a skillet over the fire or camp stove, dump in contents of bag, and cook just until heated through.

Description: 
Five minute preparation at home, then into a plastic baggie for transport, and heat over an open fire!!!  Yum!!! Please don't try to use frozen green beans - it just doesn't work. You can turn this dish into a complete meal by adding sliced sauteed chicken.
