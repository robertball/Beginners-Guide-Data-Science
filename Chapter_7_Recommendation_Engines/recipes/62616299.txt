Description: 
I love many recipes on AR and some call for boxed recipes. I have been using the recipe for years, it is in a very old cook book that I cherish. A very special lady from Manitoba shared it with her community, now I will share it with AR world. This cake is best used with puddings, or fruit added or as a trifle.
