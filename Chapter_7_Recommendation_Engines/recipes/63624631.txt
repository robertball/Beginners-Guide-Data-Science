Ingredients:
1/3 cup Herdez Pasilla Cooking Sauce
1/4 cup honey
The juice of 1 lime
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tbs olive oil
1 pork tenderloin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F
In a small pan mix the Pasilla sauce, honey, lime juice, garlic,  and olive oil.
Cook over medium low heat until the honey dissolves and mixes with the other ingredients, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Arrange the tenderloin in a baking dish.  Pour the sauce over and around the meat.
Cover the dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Remove the foil, but save it.  Baste the meat with the sauce and return to the oven, uncovered, for 10 more minutes.
Remove from oven, baste again and set aside covered with the foil to rest for about 10 minutes.
Pour the remaining sauce in a small sauce pan and cook over medium high heat until reduced and slightly thickened.
Slice the tenderloin and pour the sauce over.
