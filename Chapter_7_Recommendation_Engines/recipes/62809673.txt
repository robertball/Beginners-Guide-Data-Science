Ingredients:
1 or 2 bunches Organic Swiss chard
1/8 teaspoon Brittany sea salt
2 teaspoon Organic virgin olive oil
4 lemon wedges
1 Tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
1. This recipe works for many different cooking greens like: collard greens, turnip or beet tops, mustard greens, spinach, tat-soi, and rapini (broccoli rabe). Wash chard well to remove all sand and remove all tough stems. In a large saucepan, bring to a boil about 1/2 inch of water and drop in the Swiss chard leaves. Return to a boil, cover and cook 2 to 3 minutes until leaves are tender. Add salt and remove from heat. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of cooking liquid. Add oil to the reserved liquid and pour desired amount over the chard before serving. Serve each portion with a lemon wedge and sesame seeds. Enjoy!
