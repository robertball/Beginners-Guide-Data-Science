Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, cut into small pieces
1 cup hot water
3 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; add butter and crush into the flour mixture with hands until it resembles breadcrumbs.
Mix hot water and garlic into the flour mixture until it all comes together into a dough; turn out onto a cutting board dusted with flour. Knead dough 3 or 4 times. Cut dough into 10 pieces, roll into balls, and flatten into discs.
Cover dough with a clean kitchen towel and let sit for 20 minutes.
Heat a cast-iron skillet over-medium high heat.
Roll out one of the dough discs to about the size of your skillet. Cook in hot skillet until golden and puffy, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough portions.

Description: 
This goes so well with Mexican or Indian soups, lentils, beans, or chilies. I'm sure you could also use as a base for quick pizzas or brush with garlic butter for a tasty treat on its own!
