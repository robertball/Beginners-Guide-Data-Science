Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAFÂ® Premium Strawberry Fruit Filling
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
3 eggs, lightly beaten
Dreamy Buttercream Icing:
1 cup butter, at room temperature
3 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, beat cake mix, oil, water and eggs until smooth. Add a little LUCKY LEAF Strawberry Pie Filling at a time, gently stirring to create swirls.
Fill cupcake liners about 2/3 full of batter. Bake 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting.
Dreamy Buttercream Icing*: Cream butter until fluffy. Gradually add powdered sugar and beat until smooth. Add vanilla and 1 tablespoon heavy cream, and beat for 1 minute, adding more cream as needed to reach desired consistency.
Spread frosting onto cool cupcakes. Garnish with additional strawberries.
