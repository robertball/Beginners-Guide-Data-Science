Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1 1/3 cups seasoned bread crumbs
1 small onion - grated, and juice drained
2 eggs
3 tablespoons applesauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix the turkey, bread crumbs, onion, eggs, applesauce, chili powder, paprika, and kosher salt in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions, then shape into patties.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange the patties in the skillet and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Place the browned patties on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Transfer the patties to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake the turkey burgers in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve the turkey burgers on the hamburger buns.

Description: 
A meatloaf style turkey burger that's moist and flavorful. My kids love these burgers and don't realize it's a lighter  alternative to beef burger. My kids just slap on some mayo and head to town. Great served with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of condiments, with a side of chips or raw crispy veggies.
