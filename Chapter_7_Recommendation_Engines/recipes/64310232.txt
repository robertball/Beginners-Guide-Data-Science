Ingredients:
2 teaspoons Ener-G Egg Replacer
1 cup whole wheat spelt flour
3/4 cup all-purpose gluten free flour mix
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/4 cup raisins
1 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup Sunsweet Lighter Bake or applesauce or prune puree
1/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup non dairy milk

Directions:
Have ready a 12-cup standard-size silicone muffin pan or line a muffin pan with liners. (Susan’s note: I used 15 silicone muffin liners.)
Preheat the oven to 375ºF with a rack in the lower third of the oven. Whisk the Egg Replacer with 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl until frothy, then set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat and all-purpose flours, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the walnuts and raisins.
In a separate bowl, stir together the pumpkin, Lighter Bake (or apple sauce), molasses, and soy milk until no lumps remain. Add the reserved Egg Replacer. Stir this mixture into the flour mixture just until combined.
Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups and bake for 30 minutes, or until they are golden and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool completely before removing the muffins from the pans.

These are sweet and rich and perfect for celebrations and special occasions. But be carefulthey’re not sugar free and addictive.
