Ingredients:
6 potatoes
8 eggs
seasoning salt to taste
1 cup margarine
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and slice.
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and slice.
In a 9x13 inch casserole dish layer potatoes and eggs, sprinkling each layer of eggs with seasoning salt, ending with potatoes.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt margarine with sour cream.  Pour over potatoes and sprinkle lightly with seasoning salt.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a casserole that was used for Lenten meals by my in-laws. It is Hungarian in origin and everywhere I take it, I get requests for the recipe.
