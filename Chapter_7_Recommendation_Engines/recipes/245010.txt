Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups dry penne pasta
4 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil
1 pound smoked sausage (such as farmer's sausage), sliced
1 onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 orange bell pepper, sliced
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced (optional)
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir sausage, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, and mushrooms until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, minced garlic, garlic powder, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes into vegetable mixture; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Drain pasta and spoon onto plates and top with sauce mixture.

Description: 
This recipe is the best when made using farmer's sausage, but any sausage links will do. Add the red pepper flakes at the end for a little kick, or leave them out if spice isn't for you.
