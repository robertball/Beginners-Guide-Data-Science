Ingredients:
2 Cups lemon juice
2 Cups Water
2 Cups White Sugar
1 1/2 Cups gin
10-15 mint leaves

Directions:
Make a simple syrup by combining the water and sugar in a heavy pan and bringing to a boil over medium heat, while stirring constantly to dissolve sugar and prevent burning. Let syrup cool to room temp.
Place the mint leaves on a cutting board and gently hit them with your hands to release the oils. Place in the bottom of a tall pitcher.
Once the syrup has cooled, add it to the pitcher, along with the lemon juice and gin, mix well.
Serve over ice.

Description: 
This cocktail is so delicious and refreshing on a hot Summer day. Beware though, it doesn't taste like it has alcohol in it, so it can sneak up on you. Freshly squeezed lemon juice tastes best in this one.
