Ingredients:
3 carrots, peeled and halved
1 large sweet potato, chopped into large pieces
1 large head cauliflower, cut into large chunks
1 stalk celery, halved, or more to taste
6 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon unsweetened coconut cream
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill
1/2 lemon, juiced, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add carrots and sweet potato. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until semi-tender, about 5 minutes. Add cauliflower, celery, garlic, and turmeric; stir well. Simmer, stirring every few minutes, until cauliflower is fork-tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add onion, season with salt, and stir until golden, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir sauteed onion, coconut cream, and dill into the soup. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and pour mixture into a large bowl. Let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Taste and adjust lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.
Use an immersion blender to blend until smooth. Enjoy hot or refrigerate and serve cool.
