1 large onion, chopped
2 pounds sauerkraut, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Set the slow cooker on saute.  When it has reached the desired temperature, saute the bacon and onion together until the bacon is almost crisp and the onion begins to brown, about 10 minutes.
Drain but do not rinse the kielbasa.  Place it in a large bowl and add the bacon-onion mixture.  Add the brown sugar and caraway seeds.  Mix together.
In the slow cooker, saute the kielbasa pieces until brown about 10-15 minutes.  Remove from the slow cooker.
In the slow cooker layer one half of the sauerkraut mixture, then half of the thinly sliced apple, then half of the browned kielbasa sausages.  Repeat the layers ending with the remaining kielbasa sausages.
Set the slow cooker on low and cook for 5 hours.  The kielbasa will MELT in your mouth.  No knife needed!
