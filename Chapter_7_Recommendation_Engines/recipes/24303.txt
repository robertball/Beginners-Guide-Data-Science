Ingredients:
6 cups rolled oats
4 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 pound shortening
2 cups raisins
1 1/2 cups shredded coconut
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large bowl combine oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  With a pastry blender cut in shortening until crumbly.  Stir in raisins, coconut, chocolate chips and pecans.
Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 10 weeks.
Attach a tag that reads:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment paper.  Measure 4 cups of the mix into a large bowl.  Whisk together 1 egg, 2 tablespoons milk and 2 teaspoons vanilla; stir into the mix.  Roll into 1 1/2 inch balls and place on prepared baking sheet.  Flatten with a fork dipped in sugar.  Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden.  Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
