Description: 
I make this salad for almost every large family gathering I attend.  It is ALWAYS a great hit and there is seldom any left over.   It is a great pasta salad which can easily be made the day before. You can vary the ingredients by using fresh broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, cucumbers, etc.
