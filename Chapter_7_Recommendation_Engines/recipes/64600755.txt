Ingredients:
Ingredients
1 medium zucchini
24 – 30 zucchini blossoms
1 small onion, chopped
fresh parsley & basil, chopped
3 tablespoons for olive oil
1 ½ cups Arborio rice
½ cup white wine
6 cups vegetable broth
1 tablespoon butter
½ cup freshly grated parmigiano cheese

Directions:
1)	On the course side of a box grater, shred the zucchini and set aside on a paper towel in order to remove some of its moisture.
2)	Prep the flowers by opening them and removing the inside bud. Rinse them and dry them out with some clean paper towels. Course chop them and set aside on a paper towel.
3)	In a stock pan, heat up your vegetable broth and keep the burner on low during the risotto making process.
4)	In a large skillet set to medium heat, add your onion, parsley, basil and oil and simmer until onion becomes a bit translucent; about 2 – 3 minutes.
5)	Add the rice and cook it for just a few minutes, until it becomes fragrant and toasty.
6)	Add the wine. This will splatter about a bit as the wine hits the pan. Cook off the wine for a few minutes.
7)	Add 1 cup of hot vegetable broth, the zucchini and the flowers. Cook until the flowers have wilted and the broth has dried off.
8)	Lower the heat to low-medium and continue adding broth one cup at a time until the rice is fully cooked, this will take about 30 minutes.
9)	Remove from the heat and add one tablespoon of butter and the parmigiano cheese. Blend well until butter and cheese is fully melted.
10)	 Plate and serve immediately.
