Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 cups chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 teaspoon fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped (optional)
1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the garlic and cumin and cook, stirring, for an additional 2 minutes.
Pour in the pumpkin puree, black beans, corn, chicken broth, tomato sauce, and 1 teaspoon cilantro; season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a gentle boil; reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes.
Garnish each bowl of soup with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream and additional cilantro, if desired.

Description: 
A friend of mine makes a similar Southwestern-style soup using sweet potatoes, but I found that processing the potatoes takes a bit of extra work.  I came up with the idea to use canned pumpkin and created this wonderful, thick, hearty soup that doesn't take a lot of effort to make. It's full of all that's good for you, so enjoy!
