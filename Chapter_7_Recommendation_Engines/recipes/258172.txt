Ingredients:
1/4 cup melted butter, divided
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 lamb shanks
sea salt, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 large onion, chopped
3 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried thyme, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary, divided
1 teaspoon dried basil
3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
1 cup red wine, or more as needed
1 (2 1/2 pound) butternut squash, peeled and chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Heat 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a large oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Season lamb shanks with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
Stir onion, carrots, and celery into the pan. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic, 2 teaspoons thyme, 1 teaspoon rosemary, and basil. Pour in chicken broth and wine; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and cover.
Place covered pan in the preheated oven; bake until lamb shanks are tender, about 6 hours. Check level of liquid every 2 hours, adding more chicken broth or red wine if too much evaporates.
Place butternut squash in a large pot of water with 1 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.
Stir 2 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary. Mash with a fork until smooth. Reheat over medium heat before serving with lamb shanks.

Description: 
A new butcher moved into town and it figures we are moving! Glad we were able to try their American lamb shanks. This was an amazing dinner and we shared this recipe with our friends Mike and D!
