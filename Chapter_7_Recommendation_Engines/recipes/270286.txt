Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large yellow onion, finely chopped
1/2 large red onion, finely chopped
1/2 large red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 large green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 jalapeno chile pepper, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
1 pinch ground turmeric
1 pound dry kidney beans, soaked overnight
8 cups chicken broth, or more as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook for 1 minute. Add peppers and garlic; cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, paprika, chipotle, and turmeric. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Drain beans and add to the pot. Pour in enough chicken broth to cover beans. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring every 20 minutes and adding more broth if needed, until tender, about 2 hours.

Description: 
Slow-carb diet friendly. We eat this daily. Keep it in stock. I separate this into mini food storage containers and freeze for an easy side dish to reheat when I don't have free time. Make sure to soak kidney beans the night before.
