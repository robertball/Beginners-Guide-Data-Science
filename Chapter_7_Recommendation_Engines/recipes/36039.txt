Ingredients:
3 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered lengthwise
3/4 cup white sugar, or to taste
1 1/2 cups white wine

Directions:
Place strawberries into a medium bowl. Dust with sugar, then pour the wine over them. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.
Let the strawberries stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. Spoon berries into 6 dessert cups, and distribute the remaining wine over the berries.

Description: 
Wonderful dessert that is light and refreshing. The strawberries marinate in the wine for hours producing a strawberry flavor wine at the bottom of the bowl that everyone will be fighting for. Adjust the amount of sugar depending on the sweetness of the berries you have. Great way to dress up not-too-sweet strawberries! Champagne may be substituted for the wine.
