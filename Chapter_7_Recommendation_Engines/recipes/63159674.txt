Ingredients:
2 8-oz. packages cream cheese, softened (light works great)
1 c. mayonnaise (light also works here, but DONâ€™T use Miracle Whip!)
1 c. Parmesan cheese
2 cloves garlic, pressed or finely minced
1 4-oz. can fire roasted green chilies
1/2 4-oz. can diced jalapeno peppers*, drained
8oz bacon (8 strips), cooked and crumbled
1-2 sourdough baguettes, sliced, and/or crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. If using bacon, reserve 2-3 Tbs and sprinkle on top of dip before baking.  Combine cream cheese, mayo, parmesan, and garlic and stir until smooth.  Add jalapenons and green chilies.  If using bacon, stir in remaining bacon.  Spread dip into a 9? pie plate or a small baking dish.  Sprinkle with remaining bacon if using.  Bake for 20-25 minutes or until dip is bubbly and golden brown.
