Directions:
Set IP to sauté, Heat olive oil, add peppers and onions until just getting tender.
Remove casing from sausage and breakup and add to pot.  Lightly cook just to brown a little.
Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes.
Add sauce, water, seasoning, spinach, and pasta. Mix well.
Close the lid and seal.
Manual pressure high 5 minutes.
Natural pressure release 5 minutes then quick release remainder.
Open pot, add half the cheese and stir.
Add remaining cheese on top and serve.
It’s difficult to figure an actual time with the Instant Pot.
