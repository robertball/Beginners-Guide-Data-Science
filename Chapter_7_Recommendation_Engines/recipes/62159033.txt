Ingredients:
2 frozen Chicken breasts
1 can drained black beans
1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies
2 chicken boullion cubes
1 1/2 cup corn
1 cup carribean jerk 30 min marinade
1 1/2 cup water
1 cup quick barley

Directions:
Add chicken breasts, marinade, beans, tomatoes,corn,and boullion cubes to crock-pot.  Turn crockpot to low for about 5 hours, After 5 hours, add water and barley, turn to high for 1 hour.  Shred chicken with 2 forks before serving.
If I was leaving it all day I would just add all ingredients to the crockpot and leave on low for 6 hours, but up the water to 2 cups....
Serve with cheddar cheese and sour cream...
Enjoy!
