Ingredients:
1 (12.5 fl oz) can canned chicken breast (such as Trader Joe's(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2 large eggs
Â½ cup shredded smoked Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon taco seasoning mix, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Drain the canned chicken thoroughly, getting as much moisture out as possible. Spread chicken on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until dried, about 10 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a bowl. Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Mix eggs, Cheddar cheese, and taco seasoning into the chicken.
Scoop 4 even mounds of the mixture onto the same baking sheet. Flatten into tortilla-sized circles.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 8 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Yes, a shell made out of chicken! I wanted to make a no-carb taco shell and came up with this recipe and it's oh so tasty! Another plus is that your protein is already in the crust. Keto- friendly and gluten free. We topped ours with lettuce, onion, tomato, cheese, avocado, and salsa.
