Ingredients:
pinch saffron
1.5 cups basmati rice
1 large (28 oz.) or 2 small (15 oz.) cans fava beans
juice of 1/2 lemon
2 cups waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into medium dice
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 cup crumbled feta
1 large handful fresh dill, minced
1 large handful fresh mint, chiffonade
salt as needed

Directions:
Crumble the saffron between your fingers and cover with a 1/4 cup of hot water. Let sit for 5 minutes. Make the basmati rice in your usual way (rice cooker or stovetop), including the saffron water as part of the regular volume of water.
Drain and thorougly rinse the fava beans. Bring them to a simmer with the lemon juice and a little water, and salt if needed. If they are already quite tender, just a few minutes is fine. If they are a little tough you might want to let them go for half an hour.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over a medium-high flame, and fry the potatoes in a single layer, tossing occasionally until tender, crispy, and golden brown. Add salt as needed. Add the garlic and cumin powder and cook for one more minute.
To serve, fill each bowl with 1 cup of rice, and top with 1/4 of the beans and 1/4 of the potatoes. Drizzle with a bit more of the extra-virgin olive oil if you like. Top with the feta and herbs.
