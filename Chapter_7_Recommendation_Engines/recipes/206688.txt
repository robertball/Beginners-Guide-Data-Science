Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
4 soft sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
2 green onions, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 egg
3 tablespoons bread crumbs
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
8 English muffins, split and toasted

Directions:
Mix the beef, sun-dried tomato, green onions, garlic, bell pepper, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl using your hands to assure the ingredients are equally integrated. Form into 8 1/2-inch thick patties.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the burgers in the hot skillet until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 5 to 6 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on the toasted English muffins.

Description: 
These were born in Inwood, NY, where I live, in honor of the farmer's market that sells the freshest ingredients every Saturday. It is an alternate version of the All-American favorite. Serve with 'the works' (onions, relish, mustard, ketchup, mayo) on toasted English muffins.
