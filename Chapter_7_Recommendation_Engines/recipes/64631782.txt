Ingredients:
2 pounds 99% Lean Ground Turkey
1 3/4 cup Old Fashioned Oats, Coarsely Ground
1/2 cup Panko Bread Crumbs
1 (1.8 ounce) package Lipton Dry Mushroom & Onion Soup Mix
2 tsp Dried Minced Garlic
2 tsp Dried Minced Onion
1 tsp Seasoned Salt
3 Extra Large Eggs
6 tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce
6 oz Fresh Spinach, Chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Blend oats in food processor until coarsely ground.
Put oats, panko bread crumbs, soup mix, garlic, onion, seasoned salt in a large bowl, mix well.
Blend spinach in food processor until chopped well, you don't want any large pieces of spinach.
Add spinach to bowl and mix with oat mixture.
Add ground turkey, eggs & Worcestershire to spinach/oat mixture, mix with hands until evenly combined(food safe gloves come in handy here). Do not over mix or the meat will become tough.
Spray 2, 12 count muffin pans with olive oil, make sure to cover the top of the pan also to make clean up easier
Press mixture into the muffin pans, each muffin should be level with brim of each cup. Makes about 15 muffins.
Bake in preheated oven until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
For better results add a small amount of water to the remaining empty muffin cups, just enough to cover the bottom of each one. (optional)
You may need to use a butter-knife to scrape around the sides of the cups to get them to release easily.
