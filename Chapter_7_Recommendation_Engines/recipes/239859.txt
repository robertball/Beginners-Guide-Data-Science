Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
3 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon powdered jalapeno pepper
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup applesauce
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, chopped with seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5x3-inch loaf pans.
Whisk flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and powdered jalapeno pepper together in a bowl. Add vegetable oil, applesauce, and eggs to flour mixture; beat until until batter is smooth. Fold zucchini and fresh jalapenos into batter. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
I love zucchini bread and jalapenos and with the bounty of both coming out of my garden I figured I'd mix the two together. The jalapenos add just the right amount of heat. You can add walnuts and/or raisins, if desired.
