Ingredients:
3 extra large eggs
2 tablespoons corn oil
1 tablespoon bourbon whiskey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 1/8 cups butter, softened
1 1/2 cups chopped toasted pecans
9 ounces semisweet chocolate chips
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat eggs in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until eggs are foamy, about 3 minutes; beat corn oil, bourbon whiskey, and vanilla extract into the eggs until just incorporated.
Beat flour, white sugar, and light brown sugar into egg mixture until smoothly blended, then beat in butter.
Gently stir pecans and chocolate chips into the filling.
Fit the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and pour the filling into the crust.
Bake in preheated oven until top is golden brown and a knife inserted halfway between the center and edge of the filling comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes.
Cool the pie on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
