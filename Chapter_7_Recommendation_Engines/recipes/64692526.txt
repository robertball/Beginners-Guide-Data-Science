Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Vidalia onions (diced), 1/4 tsp sea salt
1 1/2 tbsp butter (or coconut or olive oil)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/4 cup full-fat sour cream (or cashew sour cream)
1/4 tsp white pepper,
1/8 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp celery salt
1/4 cup homemade mayo
1 1/2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
1 tsp coconut aminos
Optional: 1/2 tsp unflavored gelatin plus 2 tbsp coconut milk

Directions:
1. Heat butter in a large saute pan over low to medium low heat.
2. Add diced onions and sea salt and saute for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Keep heat just low enough so they onions donâ€™t burn.)
3. Add garlic and saute for another 5-10 minutes or until onions are caramelized. Set aside to cool.
4. Mix celery salt, cumin, and pepper into sour cream and add to food processor. Add about a tbsp of the caramelized onions to the food processor, then add mayo, parsley, and coconut aminos. Process until smooth. Stir in the remaining caramelized onions.
5. Refrigerate dip for at least 6 hours or overnight for best taste. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
*Optional gelatin: This gives the dip a similar thickness to Heluva Good dip. It is not necessary for taste. Without it the dip will be thinner but still tasty. Put coconut milk or water in a saucepan. Sprinkle 1/2 tsp gelatin** over the top and mix. Put on very low heat until gelatin dissolves completely (should only take about a minute). Remove from heat and let sit until just cooled to the touch. Add to dip and mix well. Dip should thicken after several hours in the refrigerator.
To make cashew sour cream: Soak 1 3/4 cups raw cashews in water for 6-8 hours. Drain liquid. Puree cashews with 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1/2 tsp salt. Add 1 1/4 cup water (adding 1/4 at a time) until you reach desired consistency.
