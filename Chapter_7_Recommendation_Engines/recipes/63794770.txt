Ingredients:
106 ounce can diced tomatoes, drained (reserve 1 cup of liquid)
15 cloves garlic (mixture of sizes)
1 1/2 XL onion. (approximately 20 ounces)
3-4 jalapenos (I used 3 and it was very mild...I prefer mild)
2-3 bunches of cilantro (I did 3...I like cilantro!)
7 teaspoons lime juice (approximately 1 well-squeezed lime)
4 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons cracked pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cumin

Directions:
Pour 1 cup of tomato juice into food processor along with onion and jalapenos. Process until smooth. Add cilantro, processing to desired consistency. Pour into large mixing bowl. In 2-3 batches, process tomatoes to desired chunkiness. Add to bowl. Add remaining ingredients, stir well. Best if allowed to sit for several hours for flavors to develop.
