4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 tomatoes, chopped

Heat the oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat; add the garlic, and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute.  Stir in the shrimp and the tomatoes.  Cook just until the shrimp turn pink, 3 to 5 minutes.  Pour in wine; simmer for 2 additional minutes.
Top shrimp with mozzarella cheese, and broil until the cheese is melted and golden.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and dried parsley before serving.
