Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup almond flour
1 cup pitted Medjool dates
1 tablespoon agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Filling:
5 avocados, peeled and pitted
1/2 cup melted coconut oil
6 tablespoons lime juice
1/4 cup agave nectar

Directions:
Blend almond flour, dates, 1 tablespoon agave, vanilla extract, salt, and nutmeg in a food processor until crust sticks together when pinched. Press crust evenly into the bottom of a springform pan.
Process avocados, coconut oil, lime juice, and 1/4 cup agave nectar in a food processor until filling is very smooth; pour over the crust, smoothing with the back of a spoon or spatula.
Freeze pie until set, at least 4 hours. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a recipe I've fine-tuned to my vegan mother's taste, which is quite the challenge considering her strict diet. So far, no one has noticed the avocados until I tell them, and the looks on their faces are priceless. It's entirely guilt-free, and an easy way to trick your carnivorous friends and family into eating healthy! Garnish pie with shredded coconut, if desired.
