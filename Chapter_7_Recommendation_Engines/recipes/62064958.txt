Ingredients:
shredded cabbage
3 tbsp. mayo
1 tbsp. vinegar (only once)
1 tbsp. evaporated milk
1 tbsp. sugar

Directions:
Mix ingredients as many times as needed to moisten cabbage. You can use as much or as little cabbage as you like. Just keep mixing the ingredients with the cabbage until it is to your liking. We usually mix it until it's very moist.

Description: 
This recipe brings forth warm memories of my childhood. We served it every year with Thanksgiving dinner which sounds strange - but it was WONDERFUL mixing in a bit on the plate with the stuffing and gravy. It is unlike any coleslaw I have ever had. Give it a try!  You won't be disappointed.
