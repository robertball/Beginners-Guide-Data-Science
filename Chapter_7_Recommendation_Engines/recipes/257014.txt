Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Whisk milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture. Whisk until well blended.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by 1/4 cup measures onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
