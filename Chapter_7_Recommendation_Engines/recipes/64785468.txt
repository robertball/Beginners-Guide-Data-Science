Ingredients:
4 cups low sodium vegetable broth
2 tbsp evoo
160 grams risotto rice
3/4 cup Prosecco
1 cup roughly chopped strawberries
2 tbsp ch√®vre (soft goat cheese)
1/4 cup grated Grana Padano
2 tsp balsamic vinegar

Directions:
In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.
Warm the evoo in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in Prosecco, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth and the strawberries, stir. Add 1/2 cup broth, stir in the goat cheese and grated Grana Padano.
Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 18 minutes.
Turn off the heat. Allow to rest 2 minutes before plating. Top each plate with one tsp balsamic vinegar.
Note: you may not need all the broth
