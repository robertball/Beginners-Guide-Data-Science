Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 t salt
lemon wedges, powdered sugar, maple syrup and/or Nutella for topping.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Place butter in a 3 1/2 quart oven-proof baking dish.
Place baking dish in oven. Butter will melt while you prepare the batter.
Combine eggs, milk, flour and salt in a blender (I add the flour last). Blend thoroughly, stopping the blender to scrape down sides if necessary.
Check the pan. If the butter is completely melted, give the batter one more quick blend, then pour it into the pan with the butter.
Bake for 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
