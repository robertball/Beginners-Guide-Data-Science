Ingredients:
6 Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled and diced small
1 onion, diced small
2 stalks celery, diced small (optional)
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter, or more to taste
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Rivels:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1 egg

Directions:
Combine potatoes, onion, celery, 1 tablespoon salt, and thyme in a saucepan. Cover with chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add milk, butter, corn, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook and stir gently until butter is melted, about 30 seconds.
Place flour, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 dash pepper in a bowl. Crack egg into the bowl and combine with fingers or a fork to create very small dumplings or rivels. Add rivel mixture to the soup. Stir to combine.
Reduce heat to low and stir occasionally, until rivels are cooked and soup is thickened, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
This is the potato soup recipe my grandma used to make: potatoes simmered in chicken broth with the addition of milk, rivels, and flour to add to the creaminess. I crave this simple recipe every winter! I have tweaked the recipe by adding extra vegetables occasionally, but this is the version I like best! Top with fresh scallions or chives and more freshly ground pepper.
