Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 fresh tomatoes, diced
2 green bell peppers, diced
1 yellow onion, diced
1 1/2 cups ketchup
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 jumbo eggs
1/4 cup seasoned salt
1/4 cup ground black pepper
1/8 cup garlic salt
5 pounds ground chuck
24 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat two 12-cup muffin tins with cooking spray.
Mix together tomatoes, bell peppers, onion, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and eggs in a bowl. Mix together seasoned salt, black pepper, and garlic salt in a second bowl.
Place ground chuck in an extra large bowl and add tomato mixture and salt mixture. Using gloves, mix until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Form meat mixture into 24 evenly-sized balls. Wrap each ball with a slice of bacon and place in the prepared muffin tins.
Place muffin tins on a rimmed baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake until bacon is crispy and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
