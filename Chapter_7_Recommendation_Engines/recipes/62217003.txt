Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons garlic, minced
2 Tablespoons olive or canola oil
3 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Or, shredded rotisserie chicken.
3 cups chicken broth
3 cups chopped carrots (3 large carrots)
3 chopped red pepper
5 celery ribs, chopped
1 teaspoon dried savory or sage
1 can cream of chicken soup
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
2-1/2 cups 2% milk
16 slices velveta cheese
1 pound wide egg noodles, dry (1 1/2 pkg)
*1 pack Saltines and 1/4 c. butter topping

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. Add chicken; cook and stir until no longer pink. Add the broth, carrots, celery, cream of chicken soup, and savory. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in cheese until melted. Pour over chicken mixture. Add noodles; mix well.
Transfer to a 3-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until bubbly.
