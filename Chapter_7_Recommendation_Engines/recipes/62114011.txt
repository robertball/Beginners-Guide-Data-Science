Ingredients
2 tbsp chicken bouillon granules
1 dl parboiled long grain rice
1 dl red lentils
1 tbsp parsley
1/2 tsp white or black pepper
1 tsp poultry seasoning
1 dl parboiled long grain rice
1 dl green lentils
** Layer ingredients as listed in the jar, starting with the chicken bouillon on the bottom**
2 tsp butter or margarine
2 L. water
OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS:
1/2 dl chopped celery
2 dl chopped cooked chicken

Directions:
Bring water with margarine to a boil in a large pot. Add contents of jar and optional ingredients if desired then bring to a second boil. Cook for 5 minutes then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and serve hot.
Optional ingredients will make the soup thicker, but if you like soup with broth, leave them out.
Great with fresh baked bread or rolls!
