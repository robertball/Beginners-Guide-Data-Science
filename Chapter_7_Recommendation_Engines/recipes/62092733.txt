Ingredients:
1 ½ cups of long grain rice, cooked
½ red onion, thinly chopped
3 celery stalks, thinly sliced
½ cup slivered almonds
1  11 oz. can mandarin oranges, drained
1 cup fat free Italian salad dressing

Directions:
While rice is cooking, prepare other ingredients.  Mix together onion, celery, almonds, and dressing.  After rice has cooled a bit, mix in.  You may add more dressing if desired.  Mix in mandarin oranges gently—they should break up a little.  Serve cold or at room temperature.

Description: 
My mother used to make this with brown rice, but I usually use white.  I also try to use a zesty Italian dressing.  It's good for any time of the year, but it's a great summer salad
