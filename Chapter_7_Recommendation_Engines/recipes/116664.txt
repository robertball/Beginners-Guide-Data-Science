Ingredients:
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm 2% milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 egg
4 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons raisins
2 tablespoons dried currants
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 dash ground allspice
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water
ICING:
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon 2% milk

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in milk.  Stir in butter, egg, sugar and salt. Combine 3/4 cup flour, raisins, currants, cinnamon and allspice; add to the yeast mixture and mix well.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; shape into six 2-in. balls.  Place 2 in. apart on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray.  Using a sharp knife, cut a cross on top of each bun.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Beat egg yolk and water; brush over buns.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.  Combine icing ingredients; pipe over buns.
