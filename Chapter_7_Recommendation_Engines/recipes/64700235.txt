Description: 
Ok, I have never made Swedish Meatballs before—and I have been missing out. These were pretty amazing.  I know there are a zillion different recipes in the land of Swedes, so here I’ve chosen to lighten them up using ground turkey and chicken stock and adjusted the seasonings to up the flavor. With our Minnesota winter still in full force, these little magnificent gems are going to help you beat the February blues.
