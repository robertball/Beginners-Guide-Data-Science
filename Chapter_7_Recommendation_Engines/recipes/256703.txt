Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) container prepared pizza dough
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces Brie cheese
3/4 cup coarsely chopped, lightly toasted California Walnuts, divided
2 ounces thinly sliced ham, torn into 1-inch pieces
Snipped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
2 cups baby arugula
1 firm but ripe pear, cored and cut into thin bite-size pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide pizza dough into 2 pieces and roll out each very thinly (about 9 x 13-inches) on a lightly floured board. Place on prepared baking sheets and brush lightly with olive oil.
Thinly slice Brie and place evenly over dough or spread Chevre evenly over dough; sprinkle with half the walnuts. Top with ham and rosemary.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
Stir together balsamic and honey in a medium bowl. Add arugula, pear and remaining walnuts and toss lightly to coat. Sprinkle evenly over warm flatbread and cut into small squares.
