Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium red pepper, diced
1 medium onion, diced
1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs
8 thin slices top round beef for braciole (about 2 oz. each)
1 (24 ounce) jar PregoÂ® Veggie Smart Smooth & Simple Italian Sauce

Directions:
Heat half the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the pepper and onion and cook until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in the bread crumbs. Remove the skillet from the heat.
Spread 1/2 cup vegetable mixture onto each beef slice. Roll up the beef around the filling and secure with toothpicks.
Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef rolls and cook until well browned on all sides. Stir in the sauce, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender.

Description: 
It may be one of the simplest dishes in Italian cooking, but it's really tasty. Thinly sliced beef is rolled around a mixture of sauteed veggies and bread crumbs and served in a red sauce....sounds good, doesn't it?
