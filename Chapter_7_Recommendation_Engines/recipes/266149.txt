salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or more if needed

1/2 bunch fresh basil, chopped
6 leaves fresh sage, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
5 tablespoons white wine vinegar

Directions:
Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and layer on a plate. Set another plate on top as a weight and set aside for 30 minutes.
Rinse eggplant and pat dry with paper towels. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook eggplant in batches until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side, adding more olive oil as needed. Drain on paper towels.
Layer sauteed eggplant slices into a shallow dish. Sprinkle with parsley, basil, sage, garlic, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and white wine vinegar.
Cover and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
