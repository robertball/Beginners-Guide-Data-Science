Description: 
Every year I bottle(can) lobster and always have it obn hand. A last minute addition to a meal, With bottled lobster on hand, a quick bisque it was. I didn't add the cognac or brandy as I was not sure it it would be appreciated so I threw this little recipe together and was a great success.
