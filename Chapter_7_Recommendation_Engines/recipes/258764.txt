Description: 
Not only do these little Italian pastries look and taste delicious, but this cannoli recipe stays true to the classic version, right down to the mixed peel and chocolate pieces in the filling and the finish of chopped pistachios on top. You won't be able to resist these! Fill the cannoli just before serving or the shells will get soggy.
