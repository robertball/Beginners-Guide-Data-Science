Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
4 teaspoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 ripe peaches, pitted and diced
2 ripe nectarines, pitted and diced
4 ripe plums, pitted and diced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter
Topping:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick butter, softened

Directions:
Combine water, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until cornstarch is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add peaches, nectarines, and plums; toss to coat. Cook, stirring often, until thick and bubbly and fruit is semi-soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice and butter. Pour into a pie plate.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Add butter and stir until combined. Mound topping over fruit. Place filled pie plate onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is nicely browned, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
I had purchased too many peaches, nectarines, and plums. So I thought I would make a cobbler, but I wanted a crunchy top. This recipe was born, and it's been a hit at home and at work ever since. Use very ripe fruit. My family loves the topping so I've taken to doubling it. My husband will eat for dessert and breakfast.
