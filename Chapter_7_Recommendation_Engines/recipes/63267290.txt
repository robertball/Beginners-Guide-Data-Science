Ingredients:
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
1 Tablespoon rice wine vinegar
3 Tablespoons sugar
2/3 cup water
1/3 cup fish sauce (most are gluten-free, but check to label to make certain)
1-2 Thai chiles or Serrano chile peppers, sliced into thin rings
2 cloves garlic, smashed with the blunt side of your knife, then minced

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and stir to dissolve the sugar.  Taste and adjust amounts, if necessary, to get your desired balance of hot, sour, salty and sweet.  I like mine sweet and tangy with a bit of heat that lingers briefly on the lips.
Note:  You can also grind the chiles, sugar and garlic using a mortar and pestle, if desired.
