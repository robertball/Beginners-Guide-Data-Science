Ingredients:
4 cups baby spinach, loosely packed
1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/2 lemon, juiced, divided
1/3 cup plus 1-1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper
1 16-ounce-package gnocchi
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1 3.5-ounce package goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Purée spinach, almonds, garlic and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in food processor. With machine running, slowly pour in 1/3 cup olive oil and process until smooth. Add parmesan cheese and pulse to combine. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice.
Heat remaining 1-1/2 tablespoons olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add gnocchi in a single layer and cook without stirring until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden all over.
Stir tomatoes into skillet with gnocchi and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in pesto. Sprinkle with goat cheese and serve hot.
