Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable stock
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon curry powder
2 cups uncooked couscous
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups uncooked quinoa
1 tablespoon salted butter
2 tablespoons slivered almonds, or to taste (optional)
5 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups finely shredded carrots
1 cup drained garbanzo beans
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup raisins
3 green onions, finely sliced
1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon (optional)
For the Dressing:
2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2/3 cup apple cider vinegar
6 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons turmeric powder
2 tablespoons curry powder, or more to taste
1 tablespoon dry vegetable soup mix
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Combine vegetable stock with 1 teaspoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; add 1 teaspoon turmeric and 1 teaspoon curry powder. Stir in couscous and remove pan from heat. Cover and let sit until water is absorbed completely, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring water to a boil in a pot and add quinoa. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Cover and let stand for a few minutes if there is liquid left in the pot.
Fluff couscous with a fork and place in a very large bowl. Mix quinoa into the bowl; allow to cool.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute almonds until toasted and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Let cool and add to the couscous and quinoa. Add celery, carrots, garbanzo beans, parsley, raisins, green onions, and preserved lemon. Stir to combine.
Combine 2/3 cup olive oil, vinegar, honey, 2 tablespoons turmeric, 2 tablespoons curry powder, vegetable soup mix, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk together. Toss dressing over the couscous mixture, a little at a time, stirring to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to let the flavors develop, 8 hours to overnight.
