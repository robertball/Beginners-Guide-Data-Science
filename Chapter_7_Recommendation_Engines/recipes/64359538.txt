Ingredients:
3 medium zucchini (baby marrows)
3 Tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated

Directions:
Cut zucchini in half crosswise.  Then slice each half into 3 slices lengthwise, making 6 slices per zucchini (or slice small baby marrows lengthwise).
Mix oil, garlic and parsley in a bowl and spread on both sides with a brush.
Sprinkle one side of each slice with Parmesan cheese.
Place on medium high heat grill with cheese sides up, crosswise on the oiled grill.  Grill for about 8 minutes, until the cheese melts and the slices are cooked through and show grill marks.
