Ingredients:
15 oz. can of prepared chili
16 oz. shredded cheese
2 pre-made pie crusts
1/2 medium onion
4 hot dogs

Directions:
1.  Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F
2.  Dice the onion and slice the hot dogs into bite sized pieces.
3.  Cut the pizza crusts in half.
4.  Lay the half crust on a cutting board.
5.  Place the chili, hot dog pieces, cheese and onion on the crust.
6.  Firmly fold over the crust and pinch the edges so that the contents are held inside the crust and the crust is completely closed.  Place the pie on a baking sheet.
7.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each crust half.
8.  With a knife, slice the top of the pies to allow steam to escape as it is baking.
9.  Place the pies into the oven for 15 - 20 minutes, until they are golden brown.
10.  Let the pies cool a bit before eating because the filling will be extremely hot straight out of the oven.

Description: 
This is a quick meal to make.  It's just like having a chili dog, but wrapped up in a nice neat portable hand pie.  Feel free to replace the canned chili with your own recipe.
