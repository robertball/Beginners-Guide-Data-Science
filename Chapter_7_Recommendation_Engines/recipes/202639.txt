Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup chopped dried mango
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup coarsely chopped macadamia nuts
3/4 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Simmer orange juice and mango in a small pan over medium-low heat for 8 minutes. Set aside.  Beat the butter, shortening, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time.  Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the macadamia nuts, coconut, cranberries, and mango; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a fresh cookie that I go for when I don't want the old standby chip cookies. A little lighter than most, and almost cake-like in the middle. They go really well with a pina colada or any other fruity drink for that matter!
