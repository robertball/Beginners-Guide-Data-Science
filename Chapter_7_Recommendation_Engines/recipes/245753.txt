Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 (16 ounce) packages frozen shrimp (41 to 60 per pound) - thawed, peeled, and tails left on
4 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
canola oil for frying
Buffalo Sauce:
1 cup buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®)
1/2 cup cayenne pepper sauce (such as Frank's® RedHot®), or to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon corn syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
Run a sharp knife along each shrimp's back and open slightly. Place shrimp in a large bowl of cold water.
Whisk eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Drain shrimp and add to egg mixture; mix with your hands to combine and coat.
Mix flour, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and cornstarch together in a large bowl. Dredge shrimp, a few at a time, in flour until well-coated, including the opening in the backs. Place battered shrimp on baking sheets.
Chill shrimp until batter is set, about 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan.
Fry shrimp, in batches, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. Test one to make sure shrimp is cooked through. Transfer to paper towel-lined bowl to drain.
Place buttery spread, cayenne pepper sauce, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Heat until sauce is combined; stir in corn syrup.
Divide shrimp among serving bowls. Stir in sauce until shrimp are completely covered.
