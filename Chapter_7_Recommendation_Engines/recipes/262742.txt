Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni
1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh chives
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup cottage cheese
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1/4 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
1 shallot, minced
1/3 cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon melted butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and place in an 8-inch casserole dish.
Combine tarragon, salt, white pepper, rosemary, chives, sage, and thyme in a small bowl. Mix well. Combine cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, and Gruyere cheese in another bowl; add the herb mixture and stir. Pour over the macaroni and stir to coat evenly.
Combine shallot, bread crumbs, and butter in another dish; sprinkle mixture over the macaroni.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
A light and refreshing version of mac 'n cheese. It still has a delightful cheesy flavor, but more on the milder side in order to allow all the flavors in this dish come together as one.
