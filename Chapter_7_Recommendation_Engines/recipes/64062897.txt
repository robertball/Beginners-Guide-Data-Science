Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
3 Tbsp cold butter
3/4 to 1 cup buttermilk
1 Tbsp milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in enough buttermilk just to moisten dough.
Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 3-4 times. Pat or roll to 3/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.
Brush with milk. Bake at 450Â° for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
