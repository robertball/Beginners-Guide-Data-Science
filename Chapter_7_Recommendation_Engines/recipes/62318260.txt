Ingredients:
3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 1/4 c. all-purpose flour
1 c. graham cracker crumbs
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
2 c. milk chocolate chunks
1-1 1/2 c. miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line cookie sheets with wax paper.
In a mixing bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat together the butter and sugars until light and fluffy.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat to combine.
In another mixing bowl, whisk together flour, graham cracker crumbs, baking soda and salt.
Add the dry ingredients to the butter-egg mixture in two batches, beating well each time to combine.  Stir in the chocolate chunks.
Drop the cookie dough in heaping tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheets, about 3-inches apart.  Press three or four miniature marshmallows into the top of each cookie.  Bake until the edges are browned and the marshmallows are gooey, 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and allow cookies to sit on the sheets for 3 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before storing in an airtight container.

Description: 
Campfire goodness without the campfire.  Poking the marshmallows into the tops of the cookies instead of mixing them into the batter will keep them from oozing onto the baking sheet, so be patient with this step. (Sometimes I wrap a marshmallow into the middle as well.)
