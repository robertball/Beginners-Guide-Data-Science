Ingredients:
3 1/2 c peeled, finely shredded Russet potatoes
1/2 c olive oil
1 1/4 tsp salt
3 T chopped fresh marjoram
1 T chopped fresh rosemary
1 T chopped fresh thyme
1 large egg, beaten
black pepper
2 c carrots, peeled, sliced 1/2 inch
2 c shallots, peeled, 1 inch chopped
2 c sweet potato, peeled, 1/2 inch chopped
1/4 c + 1 T olive oil
2 c zucchini, 1/2 inch half-rounds
2 tsp minced garlic
2 T chopped fresh thyme
1/3 c red wine
1/3 c vegetable stock
salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F.
Strain potatoes and squeeze to express liquid.
Combine potatoes, oil, slat, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, egg, and pepper.
Set aside 1 1/4 c potato mixture covered in refrigerator. Press remaining mixture into 10 inch pie plate bottom and sides. Dab paper towel over surface to remove remaining moisture.
Bake crust at 425F for 20 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Reduce heat to 350 and cook 10 minutes more until bottom is slightly golden or dry.
Preheat oven to 475F.
Toss carrots, shallots, and sweet potatoes with 1/4 c olive oil, salt and pepper. Roast at 475F about 45 minutes until tender (sweet potato will get mushy).
Add zucchini, garlic, and thyme to roasted vegetables and mix. Roast an additional 15 minutes to soften zucchini.
Reduce oven to 400F.
Stir wine and stock into vegetables, deglazing pan.
At this point, the bottom crust, roasted vegetables, and reserved potatoes can be kept in the refrigerator until ready to assemble.
Season with salt and pepper. Pour into crust.
Squeeze moisture from reserved shredded potatoes. Top roasted vegetables with reserved potatoes. Drizzle with 1 T olive oil.
Bake at 400F for 20 minutes or until golden.
Let pie rest at least 45 minutes before serving.
