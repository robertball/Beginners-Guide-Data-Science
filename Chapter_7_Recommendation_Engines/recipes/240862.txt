Description: 
A delicious recipe for vegan French toast. Spice it up with 1/3 teaspoon nutmeg, cloves, or 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. Add a mashed banana or a few tablespoons of applesauce to the mix for added sweetness and flavor. Add fresh berries or crushed nuts to the mix if you wish for even more variety. Of course, finish it off with a drizzle of maple syrup for an amazing dairy-free, egg-free, vegan breakfast.
