Description: 
Delicious, low fat, chocolate flavored Protein Milk Shake perfect for athletes as well as a healthy alternative to ice cream for the kids. Protein can be substituted for about 3/4 c of chocolate Ovaltine for the kids, although I do add a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder to the mix.
