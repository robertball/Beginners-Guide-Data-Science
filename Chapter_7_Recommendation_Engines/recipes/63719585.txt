Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can black beans, drained, rinsed and patted dry
1/4 cup onion, cut into wedges
1/4 cup corn, drained well
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped into little pieces
2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 eggs
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon Thai chili sauce or hot sauce
1/2 cup bread crumbs, oats, or Panko crumbs

Directions:
Chop onion and garlic and cilantro.
Mash black beans with a fork or Slap chop until thick and pasty.
Add onion, garlic and cilantro to mashed beans.
In a small bowl, mix eggs, chili powder, cumin, and chili sauce.
Stir the egg mixture into the mashed beans. Add bread crumbs until the mixture is sticky and holds together. Divide mixture into four patties.
If pan-frying, heat 2 Tbsp. oil (I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil) and cook over medium high heat, approx. 8 minutes first side, 5 minutes the second side.
If grilling, place patties on foil, and grill about 8 minutes on each side.  Lightly spray foil with non-stick spray.
If baking, place patties on baking sheet, and bake about 10 minutes on each side at 375 on cookie sheet coated with non-stick spray.

Description: 
Winner!  These robust patties replace store bought patties and taste much better at a fraction of the price.  They can be pan-fried, oven-baked or grilled and hold together perfectly.  These can also be prepared in advance and frozen for later.
