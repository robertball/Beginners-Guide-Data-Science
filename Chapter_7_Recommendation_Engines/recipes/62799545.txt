Ingredients:
For Pancakes:
- 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 8 ounces buttermilk
- 4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 2 teaspoons red liquid food coloring
- Extra butter or nonstick cooking spray
For Cream Cheese Glaze:
- 4 ounces low-fat cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup powdered sugar, sifted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon milk, if needed

Directions:
Preheat a griddle to medium-high heat. In a bowl, use a whisk to combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the milk, buttermilk, butter, vanilla extract, white vinegar and food coloring, whisking to combine completely. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring just until combined. Do not overmix.
Brush a little butter or spray nonstick cooking spray on the hot griddle, and spoon batter into the desired sized pancakes. Cook until bubbles form in the batter, the edges are dry and the underside is lightly brown, about 5 minutes, then flip over and cook the other side 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat as needed until all of the batter is used.
As pancakes cook, make the cream cheese glaze: In a small bowl, use a fork to stir together the cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Add a little milk if needed to make a glaze that has a thin enough consistency to drizzle.
To serve, stack three pancakes on a plate and drizzle cream cheese glaze over them.

Description: 
Red velvet cake is a classic Southern treat. These red velvet pancakes channel the brilliant red hue and the light chocolate flavor of the cake, right down to a cream cheese glaze that's a riff on the cream cheese frosting that usually tops red velvet cake. They're the perfect indulgence for a special breakfast or brunch.
