1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup chopped maraschino cherries

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Beat in the bananas just until combined. Stir in the walnuts, chocolate chips and cherries.
Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 70-80 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
