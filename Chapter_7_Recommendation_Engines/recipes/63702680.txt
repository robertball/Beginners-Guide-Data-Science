Description: 
I've been trying to make a perfect Strawberry Cupcake to go with the Real Strawberry Frosting recipe I developed a couple of years ago. It's been a long road and lots of cupcakes tested and tasted along the way. I think I have finally got the recipe. It works every time I make it. The trick was NOT using puree as I do when making the frosting. Rather, it was changing the texture of the strawberries into a powder that brought this cupcake recipe out of my test kitchen and into my recipe box! I am pleased with the results!
