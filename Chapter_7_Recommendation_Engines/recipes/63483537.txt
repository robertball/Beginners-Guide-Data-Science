Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups light corn syrup
3/4  cups white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt. Cut in 1 cup of butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the prepared pan, and press in firmly.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In a large bowl mix together the eggs, corn syrup, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons butter, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the chopped pecans.
Spread the filling evenly over the crust as soon as it comes out of the oven.
Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until set. Allow to cool completely on a  wire rack before slicing into bars.
