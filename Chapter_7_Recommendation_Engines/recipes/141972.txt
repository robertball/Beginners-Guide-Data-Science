Ingredients:
4 cups self-rising flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2/3 cup shortening
2 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Sift together the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture has a fine crumb or cornmeal texture. Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until a soft dough forms.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, pulling off any pieces sticking inside the bowl. Gather dough into a ball and knead about 20 times, until smooth and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Working on a floured surface, roll or pat the dough out to 1 inch thickness. Cut into rounds with a 2 inch biscuit cutter, or the floured rim of a glass, by pressing straight down and up. Twisting the cutter will prevent the biscuits from rising as high. Place biscuits about 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet, and allow to rest a few minutes.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.

Description: 
I'm a Southern girl and these are the ultimate buttermilk biscuits. They're easy to make and, the best part is, you put the dough in the fridge the night before to let them rise extra high!
