Title:
Slow Cooker Chocolate Pot de Creme (with ganache!) Recipe

Ingredients:
5 egg yolks
2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup baker's sugar (I like how fine the granules are in baker's sugar)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (not a typo. a whole tablespoon!)
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
Ganache topping: 1/2 cup chocolate chips & 1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Use a 6-quart slow cooker with an inserted oven-safe dish that fits all the way inside your stoneware. (I use a 1 1/2 quart oval Corningware dish. ) Add water around the dish until reaching the halfway point on the side (about 1/2 to 1 cup of water).
In a mixing bowl, whip together the yolks, cream, sugar, vanilla, and cocoa powder. Pour this mixture into your inserted dish. Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for 2 to 4 hours. Your custard should be set in the center and not too jiggly. Touch it lightly with your finger---you shouldn't get a bunch of gook on your finger.
Unplug your cooker and let it cool for an hour or so, or until you can safely remove the inserted dish. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, or until fully cool.
To make the ganache (this is optional, but it's so good and so easy, you really should just make it and impress yourself):  Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave (not long---30 seconds or so, then add a few at a time--don't scorch the chocolate!), and whisk in the heavy cream until it's fully incorporated. Pour evenly over the top. Return to the refrigerator for ANOTHER 2-3 hours (this is the hard part) before serving.
