Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (105° - 110° F) or (40° - 43° C)
1 Tbs. yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup oil
3 1/2 - 4 cups bread flour
2 cups white whole wheat flour
1/3 cup powdered milk
1 1/2 tsp. salt

Directions:
In a large glass bowl, heat water in microwave for 1-2 minutes, until it reaches the correct temperature- no hotter. Add yeast, sugar, and oil, and allow to sit 10 minutes, until bubbly.
Add flours, powdered milk, and salt, and mix until dough comes together. (Start with the least amount of flour.).
Turn out onto lightly floured work surface, and knead for 6-8 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until dough is soft and smooth. (Do not add more than 1/2 cup more flour, including the flour used on the work surface. )
Form a round ball, and place in lightly oiled bowl, cover, and allow to rise approximately one hour, or until doubled.
Punch down, and again, turn out onto work surface. Divide dough in half, and form 2 loaves. Place in lightly oiled loaf pans. Cover and allow to rise to 1" above pan rims.
Preheat oven to 350° F.
Bake bread for 35 - 45 minutes, until top of loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cover with aluminum foil if tops are browning too quickly.
Remove bread from oven, and turn out onto cooling rack. Allow to cool before cutting.
