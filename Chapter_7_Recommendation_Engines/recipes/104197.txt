1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon Morton® Table salt
Morton® Rock Salt for Making Ice Cream*

Directions:
Combine ingredients; mix well. Pour into freezer container. Freeze according to Freezing Directions.
Follow manufacturer's instructions for assembling ice cream maker. Fill freezer tub with a mixture of one (1) part Morton(R) Rock Salt for Making Ice Cream and eight (8) parts crushed ice to a level well above the line of the mixture in the ice cream container. Pack ice down firmly and let stand 5 minutes. For a hand-cranked model, turn crank slowly, increasing speed as the mixture begins to freeze.
