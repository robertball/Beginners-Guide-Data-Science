Ingredients:
Vinaigrette:
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 green onions, sliced
4 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon fennel seed
salt to taste
3 cups water
1 1/2 cups quinoa, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup hazelnuts
5 tablespoons sweetened dried cranberries
1 apple, cored and chopped

Directions:
Blend orange juice, olive oil, green onion, lemon juice, chives, cilantro, parsley, balsamic vinegar, fennel seed, and salt together in a blender until dressing is smooth.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread hazelnuts out on a baking sheet.
Roast hazelnuts in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour nuts onto a clean towel and rub to remove skins; roughly chop hazelnuts and discard skins.
Combine quinoa and cranberries in a large bowl; pour dressing over the top and toss to coat. Stir apple and hazelnuts into quinoa mixture just before serving. Season with salt.

Description: 
I adapted this recipe from a Beans, Grains and Lentils class I attended about 20 years ago. It is a favorite of mine with great flavor.
 Quinoa is a nutritional powerhouse. It is high in protein, magnesium, and iron as well as a good source of calcium. Quinoa is gluten free, easy to digest, and a complete protein.
