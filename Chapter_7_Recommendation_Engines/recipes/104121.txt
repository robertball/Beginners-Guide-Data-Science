Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour
1 cup SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract
1 teaspoon lemon rind
Lemon Filling
2/3 cup SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup water
2 egg yolks, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons lemon rind
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
Whipped Cream Frosting (optional)
1 1/4 cups whipping cream
2 tablespoons SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend
1 teaspoon lemon rind
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
Cake Layer Directions: preheat oven to 350 degrees  F. Grease and flour 2 (8-inch) round cake pans.
Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a fork or a pastry blender until crumbly. (This procedure may be done with a mixer at the lowest speed).
Stir together eggs, milk, lemon extract, and lemon rind in a small mixing bowl; add 1/3 of the egg mixture to flour mixture. Beat at low speed of an electric mixer until blended. Beat at medium speed for 30 seconds or until batter is smooth, stopping to scrape down sides of the bowl. Repeat procedure 2 times. Spoon batter into prepared pans.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on a wire rack 10 minutes; remove layers from pans and cool on a wire rack.
Lemon Filling Directions: combine SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, cornstarch, and water. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, in a non reactive saucepan until mixture thickens. Gradually add about one-fourth of hot custard mixture into yolks, whisking until blended; return to remaining hot mixture, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture comes to a boil; boil 1 minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and stir in butter, lemon rind and lemon juice. Place plastic wrap on the surface. Set aside to cool.
Whipped Cream Frosting Directions: beat whipping cream until foamy; gradually add SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking, lemon rind, and lemon extract, beating until soft peaks form.
To Assemble Cake: spread Lemon Filling between cake layers. Spread Whipped Cream Frosting on top and sides of cake.
