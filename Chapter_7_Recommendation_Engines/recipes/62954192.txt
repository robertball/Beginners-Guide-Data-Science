4 cup flour
1 tsp cinnamon
1 cup hot water
2 tsp baking soda
1 cup sugar

1 tsp ginger

Directions:
Mix shortening, sugar & eggs; add molasses
Sift dry ingredients; add to creamed ingredients; mix in hot water
Drop onto greased cookie sheet; bake for 10 minutes or until browned (my Great Grandma didn't give me a time; so this is a rough estimation)

Description: 
When I lived in Japan my Japanese friends were amazed that American's would bake a cookie with ginger. They loved this cookie. This is a nice ginger bread cookie with out having to break your teeth to eat it.
