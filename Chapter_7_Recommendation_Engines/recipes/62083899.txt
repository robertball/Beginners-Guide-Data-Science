Ingredients:
6-8 oz lumb crab meat
1/4 cup light mayo
juice of 1 lime
1 tbsp red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 tbsp green onion, finely chopped
1 tbsp chopped cilantro
1 avocado
2-4 dashes of Old Bay Seasoning
2-4 dashes of Tabasco
1 pinch salt
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Chop bell pepper, cilantro and onion.  Combine mayo, juice, onion, cilantro, bell pepper and seasonings.  Gently fold in crab.  Cover with plastic wrap directly on the salad and refrigerate about 15 minutes.  To serve, cut avocado in half and carefully scoop out of shell.  Top each avocado half with 1/2 of the salad.
Amounts are variable, if you like a moister salad, add more mayo.  If you like it hot, add more Tabasco. If you want it crunchier, add a little more vegetables. Everything is to taste here!
