Ingredients:
Cake:
3/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
2 1/2 ounces unsweetened baker's chocolate
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup egg substitute
1/4 cup brewed coffee
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons Frangelico*
Glaze:
3 ounces Sugar free chocolate
2 tablespoons Frangelico*

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray an 8-inch cake pan with cooking spray.  Set aside.
Bake hazelnuts in preheated 350 degrees F oven until golden brown (approx. 5-7 minutes).  Set aside.
Make cake.  Melt chocolate in a small pan over low heat.  Set aside.  Place hazelnuts and remaining cake ingredients in a medium mixing bowl.  Stir until well blended.  Add chocolate and mix well.  Pour into prepared 8-inch cake pan.  Bake 15-20 minutes.  Cake will seem slightly underbaked.
Remove cake from pan.  Cool on a wire rack.
Place cool cake on a serving plate.
Make glaze. Place chocolate and Frangelico* in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat while stirring constantly.  Pour melted chocolate glaze over torte.   Refrigerate torte until ready to serve.
