Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups tomato juice
1 1/4 cups vodka
2 serrano chile peppers, seeded and minced
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup olive juice
1 pickled red pepper (such as Peppadew®), minced
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
1 large clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
ice cubes
8 ribs celery
8 spears pickled asparagus
8 pitted green olives
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir tomato juice, vodka, serrano chile peppers, red wine vinegar, olive brine, red pepper, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon black pepper, sriracha sauce, garlic, lemon zest, celery salt, and kosher salt together in a pitcher. Cover the pitcher and refrigerate until chilled, 2 to 4 hours.
Divide ice between 8 Collins glasses. Pour vodka mixture over ice and garnish each with celery rib, asparagus spear, green olive, and black pepper.

Description: 
I love sriracha and using it to replace the conventional Tabasco® hot sauce in my go-to Bloody Mary recipe creates an equally quenching, but slightly brighter and spicier cocktail. For more fire, substitute with habanero chiles or pepper vodka. Garnish with celery ribs, pickled asparagus, and green olives.
