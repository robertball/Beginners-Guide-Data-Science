Ingredients:
1 carton extra firm tofu, pressed, then cut into 1 inch cubes
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 Tbsp. molasses
2 Tbsp. lime juice
2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
2 Tbsp. fresh chopped cilantro
salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
1-2 Tbsp. canola or peanut oil(use a high temp oil)

Directions:
1.  Drain tofu and cut in half lengthwise and press. To press: Put tofu slices in between several layers of paper towels, or a dish towel, and place large heavy object on top.  I use a baking stone, then pile canned tomatoes, cast-iron skillet, whatever I have that is heavy and handy .
2.  While tofu is pressing, combine next six ingredients.  Season with salt and pepper.
3.Heat large cast-iron skillet or non-sticker and add 1 tbsp oil.  When hot, add tofu and cook over med.-high heat.  Do not turn for @ 7 minutes.  Should be golden.  Flip and cook other side(s) until all are golden. Add more oil as needed.
4. Pour in marinade and shuffle the pan back and forth to cover the tofu.  Cook at medium heat until tofu gets "glazed".  Don't let it cook too long and get sticky.

Description: 
Tofu alone is bland. It takes on the flavor of whatever you marinate it in, therefore, marinating is a must.  If you do not have the time to marinate, try this awesome recipe and glazing technique.
