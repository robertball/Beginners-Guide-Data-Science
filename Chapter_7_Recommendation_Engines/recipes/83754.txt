Ingredients:
2 medium shallots, minced
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
4 cups thinly sliced radishes
1 cup Italian flat-leaf parsley (whole leaves, washed, patted dry, stems discarded), lightly packed
4 large hard-cooked eggs, in small dice

Directions:
Whisk shallots, mustard and vinegar with a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper in a 2-cup measuring cup.  Gradually whisk in oil in a slow, steady stream to form a thick dressing. (Can be covered and held at room temperature several hours.)
Place radishes, parsley and chopped eggs in a medium bowl. (Can be covered and refrigerated for several hours.)
When ready, toss with dressing, adjust salt, pepper and vinegar to taste, and serve.
