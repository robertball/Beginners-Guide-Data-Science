Description: 
This recipe used to be printed on the Old Bay® cans, but it was removed a decade or more ago; it is very different than the one on the current Old Bay website. I much prefer this one and even today occasionally see a posting from someone looking for the old recipe from the Old Bay can. Well, here it is!
