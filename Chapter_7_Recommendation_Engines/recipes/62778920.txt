Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
4 lamb shanks
salt and pepper (sprinkled on the lamb)
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 c. dry red wine
3/4 c. dry white wine
1 c. water
1 tsp. chicken bouillon
2 tbsp. fresh rosemary (1 tbsp. dried)
2-3 twigs fresh thyme (1 tsp. dried)

Directions:
In a large cooking pan (one that has a cover), warm up the olive oil over medium heat (don't let the oil get smokey though). Then add the lamb shanks and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook on each side (adding salt and pepper as you go) until the lamb is lightly browned (about 10 minutes). Remove from the heat and set aside.
Toss the diced onions in the oil, along with the garlic, and stir for about 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and stir well. Then place the lamb shanks back into the pan and cover. Let simmer, covered, turning each shank every half hour until the meat begins fall off the bone (about 2-1/2 to 3 hours, but if you have to cook longer for the "falling off the bone" bit, it's worth the wait).
