Ingredients:
1 large bunch Swiss chard
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger with juices
salt to taste

Directions:
Place chard on a flat work surface. Remove large stems and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Chop leaves coarsely.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chard stems; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Toss in chard leaves and season with salt; cook and stir until chard is wilted and liquid is mostly reduced, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I usually don't add much to Swiss chard, as I love its natural flavor, but the addition of ginger brings it up a couple more notches. Hope you enjoy it too.
