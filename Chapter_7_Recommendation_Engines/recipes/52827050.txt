Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 egg
1 egg yolk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter (Chunky Style)
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup Reese's Peanut Butter Chips

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, yolks, and vanilla; mix until fluffy. Stir in peanut butter. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Finally, stir in the peanuts and Peanut Butter Chips. Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
Roll dough into walnut sized balls. Place on the prepared cookie sheet and flatten slightly with a fork. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should look dry on top. Allow to cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to cool completely on a rack. These cookies taste great when slightly undercooked.

Description: 
This cookie got its name because a whole 18-ounce jar of peanut butter is used to make it. It is the creamiest, moistest cookie I have ever had, and bound to be a favorite with anyone who makes them. Just don't over bake them!Modified from: The Whole Jar of Peanut Butter Cookies
