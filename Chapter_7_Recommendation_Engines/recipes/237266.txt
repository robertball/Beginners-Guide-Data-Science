Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Heat olive oil and sesame oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat; add garlic and decrease heat to medium. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add asparagus, soy sauce, and water to garlic; cook and stir until liquid is mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes. Cover wok and cook until asparagus are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a very quick and healthy vegetable side dish. Even my son, who is very picky, loves this. It works well as a snack with wine, as an appetizer, or as a side dish, especially for Asian-inspired dishes.
