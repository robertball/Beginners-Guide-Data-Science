2 (8 ounce) cans Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls

Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray large cookie sheet with cooking spray. Stir together crabmeat, cream cheese, onions and garlic salt.

Place 1 teaspoon crab mixture on center of each triangle about 1 inch from short side of triangle. Fold short ends of each triangle over filling; pinch sides to seal. Roll up. Place on cookie sheet.
Stir together egg yolk and water. Brush egg mixture over snacks. Sprinkle with sesame seed. Discard any remaining egg mixture.
