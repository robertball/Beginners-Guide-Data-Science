Description: 
We just love this as a great summer substitute when everyone is tired of the usual potato salad fare and you are overrun with fresh vegies from the garden. The cool and crunchy vegetables go well with the grains and you know your family is eating something high in fiber and very healthy. If your kids like potato salad, they will like this.
