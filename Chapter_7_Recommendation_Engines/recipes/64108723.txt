Ingredients:
1 large or 2 small zucchini, shredded (2 cups)
6 large eggs
2-3 scallions, green and white
1/2 cup almond flour or 2 tablespoons coconut flour
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon sea salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons coconut oil or butter (melted)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place zucchini and yellow onion in food processor using the shredding attachment  or my new handy salad express.
Place into a colander to release its liquid for 10 minutes.  Or you can squeeze with a white dish towel.
In a mixing bowl whisk eggs.  Chop the scallions into thin slices and add to the bowl along with flour, onion powder, basil, salt and pepper.  Whisk together then add in zucchini.
Take a baking dish and brush with oil or butter.
Pour in your egg ingredients and bake for 34-40 minutes or until center is firm.
Top with diced tomatoes, sliced avocado or salsa!
