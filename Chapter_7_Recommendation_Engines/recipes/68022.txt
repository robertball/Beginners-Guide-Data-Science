Ingredients:
1 pound dried pinto beans, washed
1 white onion, chopped
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped

salt to taste

Directions:
Place beans in a large pot with onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and lard; add enough water to cover with 4 to 5 inches of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook for 2 to 3 hours. Depending on the beans, it may take up to 5 hours. Add more water if necessary.
When beans are soft, season to taste with salt.

Description: 
I searched all the recipes, and none are close to real Mexican beans.  The canned type are only a pale imitation of the real beans simmering all day on the stove.  Easy and inexpensive, too. Do not soak and drain beans overnight as per American or European bean recipes. Cook the beans in their own liquid.  You can use black beans and different chile peppers in this recipe.
