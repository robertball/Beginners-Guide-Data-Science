1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tsp marjoram or thyme
8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup reduced sodium chicken broth
1 cup low-fat evaporated milk
1/8 tsp ground pepper

salt and pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked
1 cup frozen peas, thawed

Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a medium sized baking dish with cooking spray.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion, celery, and garlic, & herbs; cook 5 minutes, until tender. Increase heat to medium-high, and mix in mushrooms. Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan, and whisk in flour until smooth. Gradually whisk in broth & milk, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened. Season with salt pepper, red pepper & nutmeg. Stir in tuna, peas, mushroom mixture, and cooked noodles. Transfer to the baking dish. Melt remaining 1 tablespoons butter in a small bowl, mix with bread crumbs, and sprinkle over the casserole. Top with cheese.
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.
