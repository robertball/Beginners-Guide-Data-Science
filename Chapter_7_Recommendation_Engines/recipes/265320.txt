Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups Italian tipo "00" flour, or more to taste
3 large eggs
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon water, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt and tomato paste. Gently beat eggs with a fork, incorporating the surrounding flour, until batter is runny. Bring remaining flour into the batter using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.
Knead dough with your hands by flattening the ball, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.
Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Roll dough out using a pasta machine or rolling pin and turn into your favorite pasta shape.
