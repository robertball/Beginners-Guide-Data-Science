Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 cup 2% milk
4 eggs
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1-1/3 cups milk chocolate chips

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat the sugar, milk, eggs, 1 tablespoon oil and vanilla until well blended. Combine flour and salt; gradually beat into sugar mixture.
Transfer to a greased 15 in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350Â° for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Place on a wire rack. Drop peanut butter by tablespoonfuls onto cake; gently spread evenly. Cool completely. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips with remaining oil; stir until smooth. Spread over peanut butter layer. Refrigerate until set. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before cutting into bars. Refrigerate leftovers.
