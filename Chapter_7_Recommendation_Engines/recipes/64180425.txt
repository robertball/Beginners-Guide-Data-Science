Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. Butter
1/2 c. Bread Crumbs
3 c. thinly sliced Granny Smith Apples, peels & cored
1/4 c. Golden Raisins (optional)
1 1/2 tsp. Grated Lemon Peel
1/2 c. Sugar
1 tsp. Cinnamon
1/4 c. ground Almonds
1 sleeve fillo dough
1/2 c. Butter, melted
Powdered Sugar for Dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.  Spray baking sheet with cooking spray.
In a skillet, melt 2Tbsp. butter.  Add bread crumbs and saute until lightly browned.  Set aside.
In a mixing bowl, mix together apples, raisins, lemon peel, sugar, cinnamon, and almonds.  Set aside.
Place one fillo sheet on a pastry towel or wax paper.  Brush with melted butter.  Layer second fillo sheet on top and brush with butter.  Continue the process until half of the fillo sheets have been used (about 10 - 12 sheets).
Reserve 2 Tbsp. bread crumbs.  Sprinkle half of the remaining bread crumbs over the fillo.  Pile half of the apples in a 3 inch strip along the short end of the fillo dough leaving about 2" on each side.  Use the pastry towel to gently fold the apples over and roll in a jelly roll fashion, bushing with butter after each turn.  Place strudel on prepared baking sheet.  Sprinkle half of the reserved bread crumbs over the top of the strudel.  Repeat the process for second strudel.
Bake for approximately 20 - 25 minutes.
Dust with powdered sugar and serve warm.
