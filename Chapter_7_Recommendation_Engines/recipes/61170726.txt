Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup raisins
2 cups chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the flour and baking soda, set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, applesauce, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat in the instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips, raisins, and nuts. Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Edges should be golden brown.

Description: 
By replacing half the butter with applesauce and half the chocolate chips with raisins, I only slightly altered the original. They are still soft and tasty with half the fat.Modified from: Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies
