Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen spinach, thawed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (14 ounce) can hearts of palm, drained and sliced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
1 (5 ounce) can water chestnuts, rinsed and chopped
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (such as Sargento® Traditional Cut)
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (such as Sargento® Artisan Blends)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine spinach, garlic, salt, and pepper in skillet; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant and spinach is warmed through, about 5 minutes.
Combine hearts of palm, cream cheese, sour cream, water chestnuts, and half of the mozzarella cheese together in a separate bowl. Add spinach mixture and stir to distribute ingredients evenly. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish; top with remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Necessity is the mother of invention - and this recipe! After discovering that we didn't have the ingredients for our original Thanksgiving appetizer, we created this out of the ingredients we did have. Now we have a new holiday favorite and a great dip to take to parties and tailgates! Serve with pita chips.
