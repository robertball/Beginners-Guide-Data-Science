Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover them and bring to a boil for 7 to 10 minutes OR tender on the outside but still firm inside.
(Microwaving the potatoes is an option as well).
Place half of the potatoes in the dish and sprinkle with half of the various cheeses, 1/2 crumbled bacon and 1/2 finely diced onion.
Whisk together cream, chicken broth, mustard, butter, flour, marjoram, dill, garlic and salt and pour 1/2 the mixture over the potatoes.
Repeat layers.
Pour remaining mixture of cream, chicken broth, mustard, butter, flour, marjoram, dill, garlic and salt over the last layer of potatoes.
Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.
Tent potatoes if they brown too fast.
