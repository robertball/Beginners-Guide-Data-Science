Ingredients:
1 pound Brie cheese, cut into cubes
4 large plum tomatoes, diced
1 cup shredded fresh basil
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste
3 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Mix Brie cheese, plum tomatoes, basil, 1/2 cup olive oil, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a bowl; cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate for 2 hours.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Add pasta to cheese-tomato mixture; toss. Sprinkle pasta with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
It's really that good. Rich and decadent. If you really want to impress, then get a small block of Parmesan and grate it. Gives a better flavor than pre-grated.
