Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground allspice
2 teaspoons ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 cups quick cooking oats

Directions:
Cream first three ingredients until fluffy, add eggs and vanilla.  Mix all dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in oats.  Let dough stand at room temperature for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto lightly greased cookie sheets.  Flatten cookies slightly and bake for 10 minutes.  Do not overbake.
Take cookies from the oven when still puffy and edges are just beginning to brown.  Let cookies cool a minute or two on cookie sheets before removing.  Cool completely on racks.  They are fragile and difficult to remove from the cookie sheets when they are still warm, so work gently.

Description: 
A delightful childhood memory of buying cookies after school for a penny a piece is what I envision when someone says Dad's Cookies.  They were baked on Winters Lane in Catonsville, Md. during my childhood days and then on Pratt St. in Baltimore before being bought by a New York company.
