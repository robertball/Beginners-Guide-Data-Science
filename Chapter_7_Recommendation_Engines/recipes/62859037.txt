Ingredients:
1 pound deli sliced roast beef lunchmeat
1 large onion sliced thin
1 large bell pepper sliced thin
1/4 tsp Italian seasoning
pepper to taste
1/2 cup mayonaise
1 Tablespoon Canola or Olive oil
8 slices of Monterey Jack or Mozzarella cheese
8 Hoagie sandwich rolls
shredded lettuce (optional)
sliced tomatoes (optional)
sliced pepperchinis (optional)

Directions:
Slice your onion and bell pepper thin and cut the rings in half. In a pan heat your oil. Add your onions and bell peppers and cook for 5 minutes. While your onions and peppers are cooking take the roast beef and roll it into the shape of a log and cut into thin strips. After the vegetables have cooked for five minutes add the roast beef. Cook for an additional 5 minutes stirring the meat and veggie mixture several times. Remove the meat mixture and set aside. Take your hoagie rolls and lightly brush the insides with mayonaise and place mayonaise side down in the pan to heat the rolls for approximately 30 to 40 seconds. Remove rolls from pan and add mayonaise, meat mixture and a slice of cheese. You can also add shredded lettuce, tomatoes and pepperchinis if you like. Enjoy!
