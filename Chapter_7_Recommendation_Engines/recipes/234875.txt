Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and diced
1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into long thin pieces
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook apples and parsnip in the melted butter until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir water, brown sugar, and cinnamon into apple-parsnip mixture; cook until sugar dissolves and apple-parsnip mixture has softened, about 5 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

Description: 
Parsnips and green apples come together for a healthy dessert. Great for those who are watching calories and fat and trying to eat more fruits and veggies. If you're really health conscious, you can omit the butter and add water to the pan in its place. Cook longer for desired texture; cook less or not at all for a healthier raw dessert.
