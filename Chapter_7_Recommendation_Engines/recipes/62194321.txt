Ingredients:
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup sugar
2 cups lightly packed fresh mint leaves
8 cups watermelon pieces
4 egg yolks

Directions:
Warm the sugar and half the cream in a saucepan. Pour the remaining cream in a large bowl.
Add the mint leaves to the saucepan, stir, cover, and remove from heat. Let steep at room temperature for 1hr.
While the mint-cream mixture is steeping, puree the watermelon pieces and strain, retaining the juice. Set aside.
Strain the mint leaves from the cream, and re-warm the mint-infused cream.
In a separate medium bowl whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the warm mint-infused mixture into the egg yolk, whisking constantly without cooking the egg. Scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.
Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula. Pour the custard through the strainer into the bowl with remaining cream.
Mix watermelon juice into the custard mixture.
Pour into your ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's directions.
