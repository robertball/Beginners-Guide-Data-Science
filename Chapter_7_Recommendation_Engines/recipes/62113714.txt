Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1 large green pepper (chopped)
1/2 large onion (chopped)
1T olive oil
2 cloves garlic (minced)
1 can black beans
1 - 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
1 c frozen corn
1 package taco seasoning
1/4 c water
1/4 c brown instant rice
1/2 t cumin
1-1/2 t chili powder
2 t salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
Add olive oil, green peppers, onion, minced garlic, ground beef and salt to pot over high heat.  Cook until meat is browned.  Drain any excess fat. (I use very lean ground beef so I don't have excess to drain.)
Add rest of ingredients and simmer for 15 minutes or so.  Serve with beer bread or taco chips.  Garnish with fresh chopped onion or cheddar cheese.

Description: 
Black beans, Corn, Green Pepper and taco seasoning make this a delicious variant of regular chili.  This recipe was born of necessity using only what I happened to have on hand. The family thought it was so delicious I decided to submit it.
