Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1/2 (750 milliliter) bottle dry white wine (such as Chenin Blanc)
1/2 pound dry brown lentils
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until the onions soften, turn translucent, and begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer 10 minutes.
Stir in the lentils, chicken stock, Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, and dried onion. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving.

Description: 
This is a substantial soup with an amazing flavor. Finely minced carrot and fresh herbs are a nice addition to this soup; I add the carrots in with the onions in the extra-virgin olive oil at the start, and the fresh chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro, fresh mint, or whatever the creatures in the garden haven't devoured) just before serving as a garnish. My family prefers this with common brown lentils, but Umbrian or red lentils would work well here too. We have this soup with thin slices of baguette and a salad tossed with balsamic dressing.
