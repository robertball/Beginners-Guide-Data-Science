Ingredients:
6 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 large egg
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup frozen raspberries
1 chocolate crumb pie crust
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 (1 ounce) squares semi-sweet baking chocolate

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat cream cheese in a large bowl until fluffy. Gradually beat in condensed milk until smooth. Add egg, lemon juice, and vanilla extract; mix well.
Arrange raspberries on the bottom of the pie crust and slowly pour cream cheese mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is almost set, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Combine cream and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring until melted and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour chocolate glaze over the cooled pie and refrigerate until ready to serve.
