Ingredients:
1 sheet commercial puff pastry, 1/8 inch thick (see note)
4 medium to large apples (Cortland, Idared, and Spartan work well)
1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tsp cinnamon (ground)
1/4 tsp nutmeg (ground)
1/8 tsp cloves (ground)
1/3 cup superfine sugar
2 Tbsp cornstarch
1 egg, beaten well

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Lay the rolled dough (see note) onto a pizza pan (without holes)
Peel apples, then slice them into 1 cm thick slices; discarding cores.  Saturate with the lemon juice to avoid browning.
Add spices, sugar, and cornstarch and toss to coat
Put the filling in the middle of the dough and fold the edges towards the center.
Brush with beaten egg and put in the fridge for 10 minutes, then brush with beaten egg again and immediately place in the oven on the upper rack
Bake for 20 minutes, then give the galette a 1/4 turn and lower heat to 350, bake another 8-10 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool.  Serve warm with a scoop of good quality vanilla ice cream.

Description: 
A fancy yet simple version of apple pie.  This version was conceived in a Montreal hotel room (with a full kitchen, nonetheless) after being inspired by all the apples at the Marche Jean-Talon.  I hope you enjoy this!
