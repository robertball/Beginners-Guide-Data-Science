Ingredients:
1 cup Jägermeister
1 (8.4 ounce) can citrus flavored energy drink (e.g. Red Bull™)
1 (3 ounce) package black cherry-flavored gelatin mix

Directions:
1. In a small pot, bring Red Bull to a rolling boil. Stir in gelatin mix and continue to stir until completely dissolved.
2. Remove from heat and stir in Jägermeister. Allow to cool slightly.
3. Lightly wipe the inside of shot-sized disposable cups with light, non-flavored cooking oil to prevent sticking. Pour the mixture evenly into 15 cups.
4. Refrigerate until set.

Description: 
In our household, our drink of choice is Jägermeister. One night, a friend suggested making jello shots with Jäger. After a couple attempts, we finally came up with one that complimented Jäger's unique flavor. Hope you enjoy them as much as we do!
