Crash Hot Potatoes Recipe

Ingredients:
New Potatoes (or other small, round potato)
Olive Oil
Kosher Salt
Black Pepper
Rosemary or whatever herb you like.

Directions:
Begin by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil.(or nuke them)
Add in as many potatoes as you wish to make, and cook them until they’re fork-tender.
Next, generously drizzle olive oil on a sheet pan.
When the potatoes are tender, place them on the cookie sheet… -giving them plenty of room to spread out.
Next, grab your potato masher and gently press down on the potato until it slightly mashes…
Then rotate the masher 90 degrees and finish flattening it. Of course, you don’t want to absolutely smash it into the pan—you want it almost to resemble a cookie.
Next, brush the tops rather generously with olive oil.
Next, grab some Kosher salt. You can use regular salt, but I’d really recommend using kosher. It adheres to the potatoes more easily and really flavors them nicely without getting too salty. -Be ye ever as generous with fresh ground black pepper.
Now, you can grab some chives…or thyme…or whatever herbs you have available -Whatever herb you use, just chop it pretty finely and sprinkle over the top. -\
Now throw them onto the top rack of a very hot (450-degree) oven, and cook them for 20-25 minutes… -…or until they’re golden and crispy and sizzling.
