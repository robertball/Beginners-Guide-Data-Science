1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
3 cups water

2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 dash red pepper flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until softened and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add water, black-eyed peas, vinegar, sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes. Cook until peas are tender, 60 to 90 minutes.

Description: 
This has become my new go-to recipe for black-eyed peas. I'm a Southern girl and never thought I would be able to stray from the tried and true meat-seasoned version, but this one wins! Delicious and low fat.
