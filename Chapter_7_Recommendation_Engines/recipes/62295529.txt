1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons grapeseeed, canola or neutral flavored oil
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 tablespoon sugar
Red pepper flakes to taste
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
ADD 1 tsp soy sauce... this makes it GREAT!!

Directions:
Rinse the wakame, place in a bowl, and cover with water. Soak until soft, about 5 minutes. Squeeze dry and trim away the spines if the pieces are whole. Slice or chop into thin strips, and toss in a bowl with the dressing. Serve now, or cover and chill until ready to serve.

Description: 
While the wakame rehydrates, mix the dressing in the bottom of a serving bowl. Then simply add the slivered wakame - SQUEEZE it dry, like spinach - toss and serve at room temperature or chilled.**With the addition of about a tsp of soy sauce, this is really REALLY good! Used about 1/3-1/2 tsp pepper flakes.
