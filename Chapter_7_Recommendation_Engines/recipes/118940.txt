Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fat-free milk
1/4 cup butter or stick margarine
2 eggs
3/4 cup raisins
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons cold water
ICING:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon grated orange peel
4 teaspoons orange juice

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, cinnamon and salt. In a saucepan, heat milk and butter to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F.  Add to dry ingredients; beat just until moistened. Add eggs;beat until smooth. Stir in raisins and enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray, turning once to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 18 pieces; shape each into a ball. Place in two 9-in. round baking pans coated with nonstick cooking spray. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross on top of each roll. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Beat egg yolk and water; brush over buns. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Combine icing ingredients; pipe crosses onto rolls.
