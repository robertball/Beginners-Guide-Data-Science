Description: 
A unique pizza made with BBQ sauce, rather than your traditional pizza sauce. I believe pizza is a personal choice as far as toppings go. This is how my family enjoys this pizza, but feel free to add or omit any of our toppings. Don't use the cheese, use the cheese, or change the cheese to your favorite flavor. Possibilities are endless - bottom line - I hope you enjoy our Hawaiian BBQ pizza!
