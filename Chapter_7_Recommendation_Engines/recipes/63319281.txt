4-5 cooking apples, thinly sliced
1/2 cup brown sugar, firmy packed

Melt the butter in a large skillet.

Spread the apples mixture evenly in the bottom of the prepared pan.
Pour batter over apples.

Description: 
I saw a recipe for muffins using this idea, but didn't want to serve muffins to afternoon guests, so I modified it to be cake.  Seemed to be worth the effort as it was quite popular.
