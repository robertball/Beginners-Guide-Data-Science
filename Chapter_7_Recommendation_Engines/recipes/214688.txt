Ingredients:
1/2 cup applesauce
3/4 cup turbinado sugar
2 tablespoons honey
3 eggs
3 large peaches, peeled and chopped
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
2 cups whole wheat flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 2 9x5-inch bread pans with cooking spray.
Stir the applesauce, sugar, honey and eggs together in a bowl; fold the chopped peaches into the applesauce mixture. Add the baking soda, vanilla extract, almond extract, poppy seeds, and flour; stir to combine into a batter. Pour about half of the batter into each of the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
