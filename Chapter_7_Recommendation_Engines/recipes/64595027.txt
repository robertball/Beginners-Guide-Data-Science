Ingredients:
6 c. Jalapeno peppers, sliced in half lengthwise and seeded (leave some seeds if you like it hot)
1 1/4 c. Apple Cider Vinegar (I use raw with mother)
1 tsp.  Pomona's Universal Pectin - found on Amazon
2 tsp. Calcium Water - comes with Pomona's Universal Pectin (along with instructions)
5 c. Sugar
6 Freezer safe jars with lids, washed

Directions:
Place the jalapenos and vinegar in a blender or food processor.
Pulse the mixture into small bits, don't make them super fine.
In a saucepan combine the jalapeno vinegar mixture, pectin & calcium water (if using Pomona's Universal Pectin).
Heat until boiling, then add the sugar.
Bring to a boil once again, then boil for one full minute stirring continuously.
Remove from heat, ladle jelly into freezer safe jars leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch of head room at the top.
Screw or place lids on and then cool completely to set.
Refrigerate for up to a month, or store in freezer for up to a year.

Description: 
Here is a quick and easy recipe for some Jalapeno Freezer Jelly.  Most recipes I see call for fruits to be added with the peppers. This stands alone, and is great with cream cheese or any other savory dishes.
