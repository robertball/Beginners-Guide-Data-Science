Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) tuna steaks, about 1 inch thick
1 cup Italian-style salad dressing

Directions:
Place tuna steaks with Italian dressing in a bowl, coating both sides; marinate in refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Preheat outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill tuna on the preheated grill until tuna lightens in color but retains a thin line of pink in the center, about 5 minutes on each side.
