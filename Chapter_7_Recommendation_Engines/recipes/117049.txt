Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) can refrigerated breadsticks
1 egg white, lightly beaten
coarse salt
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes

Directions:
On an unfloured surface, roll each breadstick into a 20-in. rope; twist into a pretzel shape. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Brush with egg white and sprinkle with salt.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 10-13 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack. For mustard dip, combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl. Serve with pretzels.
