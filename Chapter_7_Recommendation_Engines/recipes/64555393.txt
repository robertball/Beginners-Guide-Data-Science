Ingredients:
Barilla Gluten Free Penne Pasta (i prefer non GF)
Simply Organic sloppy joe seasoning packet
Ground beef 15% fat (or whatever % you like)
Onion
a couple pinches of cayenne pepper (for a tiny kick)

Directions:
I like to sautee onions until they are just a little brown.
then prepare the sloppy joe as package indicates.
meanwhile, cook penne pasta to desired tenderness.
once done, put sloppy joe over pasta.

Description: 
sloppy joe over penne pasta. I thought that pasta could be just as good as a bun. I'm from Cincinnati, OH where we have 3 ways (chili over spaghetti with cheese).
