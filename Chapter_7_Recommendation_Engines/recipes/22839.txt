Description: 
Time consuming, but worth it.  This is a recipe my mom only makes for holidays or when her kids come home to visit.  The sauce is better if you make it the day before and let it sit over night.  You can make this ahead of time and freeze for a few weeks before you bake them.  Serve in large squares smothered with any left over tomato sauce and a little parmesan on top.
