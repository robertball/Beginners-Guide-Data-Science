Description: 
This recipe will guarantee they eat their raw veggies! It is SO great!  My grandpa 'invented' it years ago and we have been making it since!  Anywhere I take it people want the 'secret' recipe!!! It's actually a simple blend of mayonnaise, sour cream and seasonings. It is best chilled overnight to bring out the flavor!!  ENJOY!
