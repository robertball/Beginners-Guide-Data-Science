Ingredients:
3-4 cups flour
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1 package active-dry yeast
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup margarine or butter
4 eggs, divided

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, mix 1 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and yeast.
Combine milk, water, and margarine or butter in a microwave safe bowl. Heat in microwave until liquids reach 120. Margarine does not need to be melted.
Slowly add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and beat until mixed.
Add 3 eggs, 1 egg yolk, and 3/4 cup flour. Mix 1 tablespoon of sugar with the egg yolk and refrigerate.
Stir in additional flour gradually until dough is soft.
Lightly grease a large bowl. Place dough in bowl and cover with a light cloth. Store in warm place until dough rises, about 2 or 3 hours.
Remove dough from bowl and place on a lightly floured pastry cloth. Divide into 2 pieces, one piece about 3/4 of the dough and one piece about 1/4 of the dough.
Divide 3/4 piece into 24 large squares. Divide 1/4 piece into 24 smaller squares.
Compose each large square of dough into a ball.
Lightly grease 2 muffin pans. Place one ball in the center of each muffin tin.
Compose the 24 small squares into balls.
In each large ball make an indentation. Place one small ball of dough in the indentation of each large ball. Dampen the indentation with cold water before you place the ball of dough in the indentation.
Cover the muffin trays and store in a warm place. Allow to rise for 2 to 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 375
Brush each brioche lightly with the egg white and sugar mixture. Bake for 12-15 minutes. Serve warm.
