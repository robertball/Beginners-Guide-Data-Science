Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) cod fillets
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 fish bouillon cube
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup butter, cut into small chunks
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
2 teaspoons dried tarragon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay cod fillets in a baking dish and season lightly with salt and pepper.
Combine water and fish bouillon cube in a bowl. Stir to combine and pour over cod.
Mix bread crumbs, butter, parsley, dill, tarragon, salt, and pepper in a bowl with a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over cod.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork and the crust is golden and crunchy, about 20 minutes.
