Ingredients:
1 small jar pickled beets
2/3 cup sugar
2/3 cup white vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 whole cloves (optional)

Directions:
Drain the beet juice from the jar, leaving about 1/2 inch pickling liquid in the bottom. There is no need to remove the beets from the jar.
Combine sugar, vinegar and cloves in a saucepan. Heat over medium high heat until the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and allow to cool 5-10 minutes.
Pour syrup, including cloves, over beets, making sure beets are fully covered. Put the lid on the jar and give it a gentle shake.
Store beets in refrigerator. Wait at least a few days before eating.

Description: 
I love my mom's pickled beets, but I don't always want to go through the fuss of making a batch. This recipe takes about as much time as boiling water! No special equipment needed. The hardest part is waiting for the beets to become infused with flavor.
