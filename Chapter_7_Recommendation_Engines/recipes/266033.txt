Ingredients:
4 ounces dried apricots
4 ounces dried peaches
1/2 pound seedless green grapes, halved
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon water, or as needed
1/4 cup small candy eyeballs

Directions:
Arrange apricots and peaches on a platter. Skewer a few grapes on a toothpick vertically and the last one horizontally (for the head).
Mix confectioners' sugar with water to make a thin, slightly sticky icing. Use icing to glue 2 candy eyeballs on each piece of fruit and on the horizontal "head" of the grape caterpillar.

Description: 
If you are concerned that your kids eat too many sweets during Halloween, try these non-candy snacks. Dried and fresh fruit like apricots, mangoes, and grapes are so much more appealing when they look at you!
