Ingredients:
4 medium boneless chicken breasts
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup creamy caesar dressing
2 T Worchestershire sauce
2 T balsamic vinegar
2 T brown sugar
1 t lemon juice
1 t oregano
1 t dried basil (or 1 T fresh)
fresh ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse chicken breasts well and pat dry. You may want to cut the breasts into smaller pieces. Place the chicken in a gallon-size plastic storage bag.
In a large measuring cup or small bowl, combine all remaining ingredients. Mix vigorously until well blended. Pour over chicken in bag. Refrigerate for at least four hours (overnight is better).
Heat a gas grill to 375 degrees or medium-high heat. Cover the grill with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray. Grill the chicken for about 8 minutes on each side.
While chicken is grilling, reduce remaining marinade by pouring into a small saucepan and heating just to boiling. Then lower heat and simmer on low until chicken is finished grilling. Pour sauce over grilled breasts before serving.

Description: 
My husband and I could grill chicken five nights a week, so I'm always looking for new flavors for it. This recipe came about from lots of tinkering, and now it's our favorite pre-grilling marinade.
