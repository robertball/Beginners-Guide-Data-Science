Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 large egg whites
2/3 cup skim milk
2/3 cup nonfat plain yogurt
1 cup raw sugar
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped peeled apple

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Whisk the whole wheat pastry flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until evenly combined. Use your fingers to make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites, skim milk, yogurt, raw sugar, canola oil, and vanilla extract until smooth; mix in the chopped apple.
Pour the liquid ingredients into the well in the dry ingredients, and mix to make a thick batter.
Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.
Bake the muffins in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
Cool the muffins in their cups for about 5 minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.

Description: 
What I like the most about these muffins is that the spices make the muffin what it is. The raw cane sugar and whole wheat pastry flour are the best to use because they are the least processed ingredients available and retain more of their natural goodness. The chunky apple bits give me more for my bite and add another level of sweetness to the muffin. These make a great breakfast or brunch item, or you can have one with a cup of coffee and unwind! Enjoy!
