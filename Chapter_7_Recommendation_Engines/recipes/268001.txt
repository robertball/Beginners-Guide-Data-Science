4 ounces halloumi cheese, cut into 4 slices

Directions:
Combine salad greens, tomato, avocado, and cilantro on a plate. Drizzle with salad dressing.

Description: 
If you can manage to refrain from eating the halloumi straight out of the pan or off the BBQ, then chop it up and throw it in this delicious fresh salad! Enjoy with a chilled glass of white and a good book.
