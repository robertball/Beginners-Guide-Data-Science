Ingredients:
5 pounds ground beef
1/2 large onion, diced
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground dried rosemary
salt to taste
1 3/4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup
1 1/2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of celery soup
1 (29 ounce) can pure pumpkin
40 hamburger buns

Directions:
Brown the ground beef with the onion in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat as it cooks, until the beef is crumbly and starting to brown, about 10 minutes.
Drain the fat from the beef, and stir in the pumpkin pie spice, thyme, rosemary, salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, tomato soup, celery soup, and pumpkin. Mix in the pumpkin, and stir until all ingredients are well combined.
Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the flavors have blended and the mixture is thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
Sloppy Joes, only with a pumpkin twist for fall. We live in Circleville, where the annual Pumpkin Show is huge, and my kids and I made this recipe up so we could have an easy sandwich available during the festivities. It can be made ahead and frozen or refrigerated.
