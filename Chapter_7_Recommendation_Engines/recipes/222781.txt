Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 pound ground beef
1/2 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 hamburger buns, split
4 slices of Swiss-style processed cheese

Directions:
Mix golden mushroom soup, sliced mushrooms, and Worcestershire sauce in a saucepan over low heat and simmer while you complete the remaining steps. Stir sauce occasionally.
Mix ground beef with monosodium glutamate, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a bowl; form 4 patties from the ground beef and pan-fry in a skillet over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Place each burger onto the bottom of a hamburger bun and top each with a slice Swiss-style processed cheese. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of sauce over the cheese, place the bun tops onto the sandwiches, and serve.
