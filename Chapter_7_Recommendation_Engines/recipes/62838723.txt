Ingredients:
1 cup  water
1/4 cup non-iodized salt
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 cups soy sauce
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp Tabasco
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 garlic powder
1/2 cup wine (dry is best)

Directions:
Mix ingredients well.  Fillet salmon and cut into desired sized chunks, leaving the skin on.  I don't get too worried about a perfect fillet job, as the backbones smoked are the best of all.  Place the chunks and backbones into ziplock bags and cover with brine.  I like to double bag them, and then place into refrigerator for at least 12 hours.  Remove and rinse fillets very well in cold water.  Pat fillets dry with paper towels, and then place on smoking racks.  Allow fillets to air dry for 1-2 hours until a sticky glaze develops on them.  I like to use a fan to speed up the process, and I elevate my racks for better air flow (hint:  place several layers of newspapers under the racks.)
Move racks to smoker.  I like hickory, apple and alder for my smoked salmon, sometimes using one, or all three.  Smoke fillets for about 2 hours.  After that there is no need to continue smoking.  Leave fillets in smoker to continue drying out and monitor.  In my indirect smoker, I can complete the smoking /cooking process in about 4 hours total on smaller sized salmon (like sockeye).  Remove fillets when they are 95% done, as they will continue to cook as they cool.  Do not over cook.
Now is the time to reward yourself for a job well done.   Grab a bubbly  malt beverage, and enjoy the sweet meat from the backbones.  It's the best kept secret of smoking salmon!

This brine is a notch up from a basic brine.  This recipe makes enough brine for about 10 lbs of fillets.  Adjust as necessary.
