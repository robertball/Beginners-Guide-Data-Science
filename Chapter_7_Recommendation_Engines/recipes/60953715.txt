Description: 
Unfortunately, my kiddos won't eat anything that looks like a fish so I have to get tricky with them. After I put these on the grill, I remove their tails, bread them and bake. They look just like chicken nuggets and my kids will actually eat them.Modified from: Marinated Grilled Shrimp
