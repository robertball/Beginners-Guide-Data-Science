Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 large cloves garlic, sliced
Freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Rinse the chicken with water and pat dried with paper towel.  Combine all the ingredients for Sauce in a large pot (I used my Le Creuset).  Make sure the pot is big enough so the chicken will not overlap each other.
Bring the sauce to a boil on medium high heat.
Add the chicken and reduce the heat to medium low.  Cover and cook 30 minutes.  Turn the chicken once 15 minute through.
Set the broiler to High and transfer the chicken onto a baking pan with wire rack (so the oil will drip down).  The skin side facing down first.
Broil the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side.
Meanwhile turn up the stove to high and reduce the sauce until it thickens.  Make sure it doesnâ€™t burn when the sauce is boiling.
Serve the chicken on a plate and pour the sauce over.  Keep the extra sauce in a small bowl so you can adjust the taste based on preference.
