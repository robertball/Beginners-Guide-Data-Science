Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
preheat oven to 400 degrees line a large cookie sheet with foil.
Cut cauliflower into bite sized pieces. Toss with oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. (I like a lot of garlic, but You can adjust to taste.)
Spread in single layer on cookie sheet and roast in the oven for 30-40 minutes stiring every 10 minutes. It will look dark but the darker ones are the sweetest.
Note: Don't use minced fresh garlic, it WILL burn.
