Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced into strips
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 small tomato, sliced
1/4 cup golden raisins
1 cup sliced okra
1 cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon water
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet; cook and stir the bell pepper in the hot oil until softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir the jalapeno peppers, ginger, garlic, and bay leaves into the bell pepper; cook until fragrant, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with the coriander, red pepper, turmeric, cumin seeds, cardamom, black pepper, and cinnamon; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Add the tomato slices and raisins to the mixture; continue cooking 3 more minutes. Mix the okra thoroughly into the mixture to coat with the spices.
Stir the coconut milk and water together in a small bowl; pour into the mixture. Cover the skillet and cook covered until the okra is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add water if needed to keep moist. Season with salt. Serve warm.

Description: 
This is okra in coconut milk curry. Very simple to make and great with rice and naan for a complete meal. A spicy and very creamy vegan curry that will even please non-vegans. If you like more spice, use more peppers or other spices to your liking.
