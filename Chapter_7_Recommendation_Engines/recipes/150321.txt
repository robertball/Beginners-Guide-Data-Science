Description: 
Chicken breasts are marinated with spices and fruit in this easy and very flavorful dish. I pour the marinade over the chicken in a freezer bag, then freeze them for future use. I take them out of the freezer the night before I want to serve them, and thaw in the refrigerator. By dinner time, they are ready to bake, making a quick and delicious meal!
