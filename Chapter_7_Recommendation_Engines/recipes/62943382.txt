Ingredients:
30 mini phyllo pastry shells
3/4 cup ricotta cheese
1 roasted pepper, patted dry
3 tbsp. grated Parmesan
1/8 tsp. smoked paprika
1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
salt
black pepper
1 tbsp. olive oil
2 tbsp. blanched almonds
1 tbsp. capers, patted very dry

Directions:
Prepare the shells: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line and 18" by 12" jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Arrange shells in a single layer in the pan. Bake 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. Cool completely on a wire rack.
Prepare the filling: Put a knife blade attachment into a food processor. Add in the ricotta, red pepper, parmesan, paprika, cayenne, 1/8 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp black pepper, and pulse until smooth. Transfer the mix into a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate(for up to 3 days)
In an 8" skillet, combine the olive oil, almonds, and 1/8 tsp. salt. Cook on medium for 7 minutes or until golden, stirring. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels. To the same skillet, add the capers. Cook 1-2 minutes or until crisp, stirring. Transfer to paper towels. When cool, chop the almonds and capers.
Snip one end of the bag containing the cheese mixture and pipe into the shells. Top with the almonds, capers, and fresh snipped chives.
