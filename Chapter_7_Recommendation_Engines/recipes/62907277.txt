Ingredients:
2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing
1 1/4 cups sugar
4 eggs
2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest, more for garnishing
2 cups self raising flour, sifted
1/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
GLAZE:
1 cup powdered sugar
3 teaspoons milk
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed orange juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 340F/170C. Grease and flour a bundt cake tin.
Using an electric beater, cream the butter and sugar together for 4-5 minutes until very pale. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating very well between each one, if necessary adding a spoonful of flour with the last egg to prevent the mixture from curdling. Beat in the orange zest. Add all the sifted flour, blend well, then slowly mix in the orange juice.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 45-50 minutes or until a cake tester, inserted into the center of the cake, comes out clean. If it starts to brown too quickly, cover loosely with a sheet of lightly buttered foil.
Leave the cake, in its tin, to cool on a wire rack, then carefully turn it out onto a serving plate.
For the Glaze, sift the powdered sugar into a bowl and stir in the milk and orange juice until you have a think runny consistency. Drizzle the glaze with using a spoon over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides, and leave to set. Garnish with more finely grated orange zest.
Serve cut into slices, and store any leftovers in an airtight container.
