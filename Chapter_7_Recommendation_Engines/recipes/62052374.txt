Ingredients:
Crust:
4 cups flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 cup shortening
4 egg yolks
2 Tb lemon juice
8-10 Tb cold water
Filling:
7 cups finely-choppled apples
2 cups sugar
1/4 cup flour
2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
1) Combine flour, salt and baking powder in bowl; cut in shortening until coarse crumbs.  In small bowl, whisk egg yolks, water and lemon juice; stir into flour mixture with fork to form a ball.  Divide in half.  Press (or roll) one section into bottom of 15 x 10" pan.
In large bowl, combine filling ingredients.  Spread over pastry in pan.  Roll out remaining pastry and fit over the top.  Brush with milk.  Cut slits for steam.  Bake at 375 for 45-50 minutes.  Cool before cutting.  May drizzle a powdered sugar glaze over the top, using lemon juice in place of water.
