Ingredients:
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 cups Of Cheez-its crumbs (See Notes)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon of coarse black pepper (Optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
On large plate Place the cracker crumbs.
In a wide bowl add eggs. Whisk until the eggs are frothy.
Dredge the breasts in the cheezit crumbs, making sure all sides are thoroughly coated.
Place the Cheezit encrusted breasts onto a oiled sheet pan. If you have a rack for the pan spray the rack also and put the chicken on top of the rack.
Place the pan into a preheated 425 degree oven. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes or until just cooked through.
If the chicken breast is thick you may need to give it a bit more time. what works best for me is to pound the high points down with a meat mallet.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Description: 
One Of My Favorite Snacks Is Cheddar Jack Cheez-It's, So I Figured I Try Coating A Chicken breast With Cheddar Jack Cheez-It Crumbs. Both My Wife And I Loved It. Try Different Sizes Of Crushed Crumbs They Do Make A Difference In The Taste And Look. If Your Going To Use Larger Crumbs You May Wish To Dip The Chicken First Into Egg, Then Flour, Then Egg, Then Into The Cheez-it Crumbs To Help Them Adhere To The Chicken Better.
