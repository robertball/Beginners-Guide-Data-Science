Description: 
I've tried a couple of butterbeer recipes I found online and they all were either so sweet they made me sick or they had oily butter in them that made me sick. so I opted for a simplified version that tasted a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch. and was strong enough to slightly inebriate something larger than a house elf. Great for Harry Potter themed parties or Halloween and even served super chilled in a frothy mug can magically warm up even the coldest wizards.
