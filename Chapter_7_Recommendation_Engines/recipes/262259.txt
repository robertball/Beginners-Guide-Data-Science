Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15.5 ounce) can light red kidney beans (including liquid)
1 (15.5 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
3/4 cup water
1 package taco seasoning mix (such as Old El Paso®)
1 (8.5 ounce) package dry corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy®)
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
3 cups shredded Colby cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook and crumble pork and black pepper in the hot pan until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Stir kidney beans, corn, water, and taco seasoning into the skillet with the pork. Bring to a boil.
Combine corn muffin mix, milk, and egg in a bowl for the corn bread mixture.
Spoon pork mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with Colby cheese. Pour and carefully spread corn bread mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until corn bread is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My picky-non-vegetable-eater husband loves this easy Mexican casserole. There's very little clean-up, it costs less than $10 to make, and the leftovers reheat fabulously right in the microwave. I haven't found anyone that doesn't love it! Meat, vegetables, dairy, and grains all in one easy, tasty dish! For those that don't care for corn bread, there is another option for this recipe in the footnotes. Enjoy!
