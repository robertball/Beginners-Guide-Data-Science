Low Carb Crab Cakes w/Roasted Red Pepper Sauce (GF)
Makes 8 three-inch cakes
Crab Cake Ingredients:
1 cup lump crab meat
1 egg, beaten
2 tsp dijon mustard
1 Tbl fresh lemon juice
2 tsp Old Bay seasoning
2 Tbl parsley, chopped
1.5 Tbl coconut flour
2 Tbl coconut oil

Directions:
Gently pick through the crab to make sure there are no shells or cartilage in the meat, and add to a small bowl. In another small bowl, combine the egg, lemon juice, and dijon mustard, mixing until smooth. In a third bowl, combine the old bay, parsley, and coconut flour, mixing thoroughly. Gently add the egg mixture to the crab, folding until combined. Then add the dry ingredients to the crab mixture and gently mix in. Try not to break up/shred the pieces of crab too much. Heat the coconut oil over medium heat in a nonstick saute pan. Form 8 small cakes and place carefully in the hot oil. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side or until golden brown. Remove from the pan to a plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle with kosher salt, squeeze half a fresh lemon over them and serve with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce.
