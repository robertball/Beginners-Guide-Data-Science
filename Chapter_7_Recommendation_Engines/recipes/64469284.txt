Ingredients:
2 cans of refrigerated crescent roll dough
2 cups shredded cheese (mozzarella, cheddar or a mix of your choice)
1 8ounce package cream cheese
1 tsp garlic powder
5 strips of bacon, cooked and diced
2 T chopped fresh scallions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a stand mixer, stir cream cheese, shredded cheese, garlic powder, bacon and scallions until well blended.
On a cutting board, unroll crescent dough. Pinch diagonal seams together. Cut dough lengthwise so that you have squares of dough. In the center of each square, place a heaping teaspoon of cheese mixture. Wrap dough around the filling and place on a lightly greased baking sheet.
Repeat with the other can of dough.
Place trays in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until tops of the rolls become lightly browned.
Let stand 2 minutes before serving.
