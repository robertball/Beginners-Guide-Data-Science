Ingredients:
1 small sweet potato, shredded
1 small Yukon Gold potato, shredded
1 small zucchini, shredded
1 large carrot, shredded
2 green onions, chopped
1 cup Nordica 2% or 4% Cottage Cheese
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons Gay Lea Spreadables, or as needed
Gay Lea Sour Cream (optional)
Shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (100 degrees C). Toss sweet and Yukon Gold potatoes with zucchini, carrot and green onion. Stir cottage cheese with flour, eggs, salt and pepper until well blended; pour over vegetables and stir to combine.
Melt a little Spreadables in a large, nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Scoop 1/4 cup (50 mL) portions of vegetable mixture into skillet; flatten using back of measure. Cook for 5 minutes per side or until browned and cooked through. Transfer pancakes to a baking sheet in oven to hold warm. Repeat with remaining vegetable mixture, adding additional Spreadables to the skillet as needed. Serve pancakes with sour cream and cheese (if using).
