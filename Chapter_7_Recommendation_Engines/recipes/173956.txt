Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pheasant breast
1 (4 ounce) jar sliced jalapeno peppers
12 slices bacon, cut into thirds
6 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 20 minutes
36 toothpicks

Directions:
Cut the pheasant breast into 36 pieces, and place into a bowl. Pour the liquid from the jalapeno peppers over the pheasant, stir, and set aside to marinate for 20 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Drain the marinade from the pheasant and discard. Place a slice of jalapeno pepper onto each piece of pheasant breast, and wrap with a third of a strip of bacon. Skewer 6 of the pheasant pieces on each skewer.
Cook on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until the bacon is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the skewers from the pheasant pieces, and place a toothpick into each piece to serve.
