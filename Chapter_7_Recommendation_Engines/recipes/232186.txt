Description: 
Bored with traditional Greek salad? I personally do not like feta cheese so I substituted a good fat (avocados) in its place. I have removed the onion that is traditionally found in a Greek salad as it does not complement the addition of mangoes. You can use your favorite Greek salad recipe as well just leave out the onion and add the mango. Goes very well served along with grilled chicken, grilled vegetables, and rice.
