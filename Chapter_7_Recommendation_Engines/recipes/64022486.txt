Ingredients:
Elmer's glue
2 disposable cups
Food coloring
Water
Borax Powder
Plastic spoon
Tablespoon

Directions:
Fill one small cup with water and add a spoonful of the Borax powder and stir it up. Then set it aside.
Fill the other small cup with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the glue.
Add three tablespoons of water to the glue and stir.
Add a few drops of the food coloring and stir it up until mixed.
Now the fun part... add one tablespoon of the Borax solution you made earlier and stir well. Watch the slime form!
After the slime forms let it sit for about 30 seconds and then pull it off the spoon and play with it!
