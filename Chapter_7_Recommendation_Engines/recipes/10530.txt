Ingredients:
1 (1 ounce) square bittersweet chocolate, chopped
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Melt chocolate in double boiler over low heat and stir until smooth. Remove from heat.
Mix together flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.  In large bowl, cream butter or margarine and sugar together, beat in eggs, then vanilla extract. Gradually add dry ingredients and mix well.
Put one half of prepared dough into another bowl and blend the melted chocolate into it.  You now have one half chocolate dough and one half plain dough
Divide each of these in half. You now have four pieces of dough, two chocolate and two vanilla. Form each of these into a squared off log 6 to 8 inches long.
On a large sheet of foil place one chocolate log and one plain log next to each other.  Brush each with water. Place remaining plain log on top of the chocolate side. Place the remaining chocolate log on top of the plain side.  Wrap the four logs firmly in the foil and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Remove dough from foil and cut into 1/4 inch slices. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 8-10 minutes or lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
