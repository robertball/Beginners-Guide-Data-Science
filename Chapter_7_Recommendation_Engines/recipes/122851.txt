Ingredients:
4 cups mixed nuts
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place nuts in two greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until warm. Set aside and keep warm. Meanwhile, in a large heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup and water. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Uncover and cook until a candy thermometer reads 290 degrees F (soft-crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in nuts, butter, vanilla and salt. Quickly spread into a thin layer on baking pans. Cool completely; break into pieces.

Description: 
Peanut brittle is done one better when prepared with mixed nuts instead. This impressive candy is simply delicious. I like to pack some in pretty plastic bags to give as gifts.
