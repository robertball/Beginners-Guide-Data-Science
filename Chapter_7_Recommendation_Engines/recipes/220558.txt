Ingredients:
6 slices thin-sliced cooked corned beef
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 slices bacon
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1 head broccoli, broken into florets (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Wrap 1 corned beef slice around each chicken breast.
Wrap a slice of bacon around outside of corned beef wrapping. Secure with toothpicks if needed.
Arrange wrapped chicken in a deep baking dish.
Arrange broccoli florets around wrapped chicken breasts.
Stir cream of mushroom soup and sour cream together in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the chicken and broccoli to completely cover. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove foil from the dish, return to oven, and bake until bacon browns, about 30 more minutes.

Description: 
This recipe doesn't take too long to prepare, and is very good served with the sauce over rice. I usually tenderize the chicken breasts a little before wrapping them.
