Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 envelope taco seasoning mix
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups ranch dressing
1/2 cup Italian-style salad dressing
1 red onion, diced
1 head lettuce, shredded
1 (17 ounce) package nacho-flavor tortilla chips, crushed into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Cook ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, breaking the meat up as it cooks, until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and stir in taco seasoning mix. Remove from heat and let stand until beef mixture is cool.
Mix ground beef with Cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, Italian dressing, and red onion in a large salad bowl. Chill the beef mixture until cold, at least 30 minutes. Lightly mix in lettuce and tortilla chips just before serving.
