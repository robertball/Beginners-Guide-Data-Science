Ingredients:
1 serving nonstick cooking spray
1 1/4 cups oat flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
2 scoops chocolate protein powder (such as Premier ProteinÂ®)
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 overripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup milk
2 large egg whites
3 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mix together oat flour, sugar, walnuts, protein powder, cinnamon, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl.
Mix together mashed bananas, applesauce, milk, egg whites, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to banana mixture; stirring until just combined. Transfer batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top of bread springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
