Vegan Double Chocolate Muffins Recipe

Ingredients:
2 flax eggs
11/4 cup beet puree (or sub butternut squash, applesauce, or another hearty fruit puree)
1/4 cup maple syrup (sub honey if not vegan)
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 tsp sea salt
1.5 tsp baking soda
1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/3 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or unbleached all purpose)
1/3 cup dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips + more for topping or dark chocolate, chopped
1/2 c. chopped walnuts or pecans (opt)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line 12 muffins with paper liners.
Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl and let rest for 5 minutes.
Add beet puree, maple syrup, brown sugar, baking soda, salt and whisk for 45 seconds.
Stir in the almond milk and whisk once more.
Add cocoa powder and flours and stir with a spoon or spatula until just combined, being careful not to over-mix. If the batter appears too thick, add a touch more almond milk. But it should be quite thick and NOT pourable â€“ rather, scoopable.
Lastly, stir in chocolate chips. Then divide batter evenly between muffin tins (should be enough for between 11-12) and sprinkle with a few more chocolate chips (optional but recommended).
Bake for 17-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool for a few minutes in the pan, remove from tins and let cool on a cooling rack. Will keep covered for several days. Freezer for longer-term storage.
