Ingredients:
100 g chicken
1/4 pc onion, sliced
2 pcs egg
1/3 pc bitter melon
1 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp mirin
1 Tbsp sake
1/2 Tbsp sugar
salt
steamed rice (for 2)

Directions:
Cut the bitter melon along its length then use a spot to take the seeds found at the center. Slice it thinly then soak in water with salt for about 5 minutes. Drain before using.
In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar and a pinch of salt. Mix well.
Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces then pour the seasonings then marinate for about 30 minutes.
In a microwave safe bowl, put the chicken, onion, and bitter melon. Cover then microwave for 4 minutes using 600W.
Take the bowl from the microwave. Pour the whisked egg then mix. Put back the cover then microwave for 2 more minutes.
Keep it covered for about 2 minutes then open and mix.
Pour the chicken and egg on top of rice. Add some myoga to garnish then serve.

Description: 
Let's stop arguing if the egg or the chicken came first because for this dish, both are needed as main ingredients. Oyakodon is a Japanese rice bowl dish. It's a very common food at home. It's simple and easy to make.
