(To decrease fat & sugar, may use fat free, sugar free pudding, lite or fat free whipped topping and skim milk)

Refrigerate at least one hour, preferably over night (the longer the refrigeration, the more of a mousse type texture the dip will have).

Description: 
This light dip goes quickly at parties - be prepared with the recipe!  It goes well with apples, bananas, strawberries, grapes, etc. - not so much with melon type fruits.
It also makes a great pie filling in an oreo crust!
