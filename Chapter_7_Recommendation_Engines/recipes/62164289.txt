Description: 
This is the Only way my Familia likes mashed potatoes, sometimes I can get away with adding roasted garlic and sour cream-chives to them, but NEVER at Thanksgiving!! We like them chunky so I don't mash too much.Do Not cheat and use a processor or mixer, these make the pot's gummy, as well as cold milk, hence heating it up. I know it's a Lot of pepper, you have to be able to See it! That's the point! I didn't learn how to make mashed pot's till I married Carlos, from his Mom, I always thought they came from a box, Nope!! Enjoy!!
