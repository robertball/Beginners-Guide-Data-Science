Ingredients:
2 pink grapefruit, peeled and sectioned
1 large ripe avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1 cup alfalfa sprouts

3 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Arrange 1/4 of the grapefruit sections and 1/4 of the diced avocado decoratively on a salad plate. Top with 1/4 cup of sprouts. Repeat with remaining grapefruit sections, avocado, and sprouts to make 4 salads.
Mix lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl; drizzle dressing over each salad.

Description: 
A flavorful recipe, inspired by a salad I had in Austin, Texas at a fancy restaurant. They added ahi in their version, but mine is vegetarian. It is great either way!
