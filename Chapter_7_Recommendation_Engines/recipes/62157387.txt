Ingredients:
Sauce:
6 tbsp. Tomato sauce
4 tbsp. Sugar
2 tbsp Worcestershire
2 tbsp A-1 sauce
1 1/2 tbsp. Vinegar
10 tbsp. Water
Chicken:
½ lb. sliced raw chicken (boneless, skinless thighs preferred)
1 egg white
½ lb. corn starch
Final Prep:
1 tbsp. minced ginger
1 tsp. minced green onion
1 tsp. garlic
1 tsp. cayenne pepper

Directions:
Make sauce by mixing together tomato sauce, sugar, Worcestershire, A-1, vinegar and water.  Set aside.
Stir chicken with egg white until chicken is completely coated.  Then put chicken in corn starch.  Mix until every piece of chicken is coated with corn starch.
Put chicken on plate and set aside.
Proceed by putting wok on fire until hot.  Then pour in ½ gallon vegetable oil.
Put chicken into hot oil (medium fire) and deep fry until half crispy.  Then take chicken out of oil.
Take most of oil out of wok, leaving a small amount.  Put in hot pepper and garlic and cook in wok for about 3 seconds.
Then pour the sauce in the wok.  When sauce boils, stir sauce for about 15 seconds.
Put the chicken in wok; stir it and put the ginger and green onion in last.  Stir mixture over.
Then serve immediately.  Serves two.

Description: 
This is something I make at least once a month for my family, at their request.  I found it online in the early days of the internet.  I generally serve it with rice (may want to double the sauce if you do) or make potato nest bowls to serve it over.  Watch the cayenne, I tend to half it for my taste, others may want to increase it.
