1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup light brown sugar

In a bowl whisk together flour, light brown sugar, powdered ginger, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ground cloves and cinnamon.
Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
Add pumpkin, beaten eggs, vanilla and oil.
Stir gently, just until combined.
Pour into a lined 9×9 baking pan and bake in a preheated 350(F) oven for 30-35 minutes.
Allow to cool, in the pan, on a wire baking rack.
When cool enough, lift the bars from the pan and continue cooling on wire baking rack.

Sift in powdered sugar and whisk together.
Add vanilla and milk (as needed for consistency).
Whisk until smooth, pearly and perfect spreading consistency.
