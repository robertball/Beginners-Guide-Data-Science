Ingredients:
1 pound white confectioners' coating (white almond bark), broken up
1 (18 ounce) jar peanut butter (such as JifÂ®)

Directions:
Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with plastic wrap long enough to overhang the dish by several inches on each side.
Place broken coating into a large glass microwave-safe bowl and melt on low power in microwave oven, about 5 minutes, stirring after every 30 seconds to 1 minute. When coating is smooth and creamy, stir peanut butter into coating until fudge is thoroughly combined. Spread fudge into the prepared baking dish.
Refrigerate fudge until set, 1 to 2 hours. Lift fudge out of the pan using the plastic wrap for handles and slice into squares with a pizza cutter.
