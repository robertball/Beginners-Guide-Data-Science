Ingredients:
1 cup mayonnaise
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Place chicken pieces into a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread mayonnaise mixture over chicken, and top with Parmesan cheese.
Bake until the juices run clear, chicken is no longer pink in the middle, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest chicken piece reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is my favorite chicken recipe, which I learned while doing low-carb dieting. I prefer dark meat so I'll use 4 legs and thighs. You can do this recipe with pork chops as well.
