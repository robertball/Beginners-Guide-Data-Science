Ingredients:
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Beat together all ingredients using an electric mixer, starting on slow speed to avoid scattering the sugar everywhere, then working up to medium speed.  Beat until frosting is smooth, adding more powdered sugar if needed for a stiffer frosting or a little milk if a thinner frosting or icing is desired.

Description: 
This is the icing recipe from a Cinnabon clone recipe.  It tastes just like the icing from Cinnabon and I use it on everything that calls for a cream cheese frosting.
