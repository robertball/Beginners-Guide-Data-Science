Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cherry Jell-O速
4 cups boiling water, divided
2 1/2 cups cold water, divided
2 envelopes unflavored gelatin
2 cups milk
1 cup sugar
2 cups sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (3 ounce) package lemon Jell-O速
1 (3 ounce) package orange Jell-O速
1 (3 ounce) package lime Jell-O速

Directions:
In a bowl, dissolve cherry gelatin in 1 cup boiling water. Add 1/2 cup cold water; stir. Pour into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. dish coated with nonstick cooking spray; refrigerate until set but not firm, about 30 minutes.
In a small saucepan, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over 1/2 cup cold water. Let stand for 1 minute. Stir in milk and sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat until gelatin and sugar are dissolved.
Remove from the heat. Whisk in sour cream and vanilla until smooth. Spoon 1-2/3 cups creamy gelatin mixture over the first flavored layer. Chill until set but not firm. Prepare remaining flavored gelatin as directed for cherry gelatin. Alternately layer flavored gelatins with creamy gelatin layers, allowing each to set before adding next layer. Top with lime gelatin. Refrigerate overnight. Cut into squares.
