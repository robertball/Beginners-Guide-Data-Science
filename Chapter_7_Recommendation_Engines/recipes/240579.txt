Ingredients:
1 avocado, peeled and pitted
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup chocolate chips, melted
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger Irish cream liqueur (such as BaileysÂ®) (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups confectioners' sugar, or to taste
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Blend avocado and melted butter together in a blender until completely smooth; pour into a saucepan and place over low heat.
Stir cocoa powder, melted chocolate chips, Irish cream liqueur, and vanilla extract into the avocado mixture until smooth. Add 3 cups confectioners' sugar in small amounts, stirring each addition completely into the avocado mixture before introducing the next; cook and stir until thick and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
Grease a baking dish. Pour the fudge batter into the baking dish and smooth with a spatula into an even layer. Sprinkle chopped walnuts atop the fudge and dust with 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar.
Refrigerate fudge until firmly set, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Avocados mate so well with cocoa. They are, after all, natives of the same part of the world. The avocado gives this fudge a delightful creaminess. This recipe was sent by a friend in SoCal.
