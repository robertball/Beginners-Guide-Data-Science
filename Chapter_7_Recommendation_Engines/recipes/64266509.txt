Ingredients:
2 cups navy or pinto beans
1/2 pound bacon
1 onion, finely diced
4 tablespoons molasses
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon liquid smoke

Directions:
Soak beans overnight in cold water. Drain, Rinse and put in new water to cover beans. Simmer the beans until tender, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Drain and reserve the liquid.
Cut bacon into small pieces and saute, drain grease.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Arrange the beans in a 2 quart bean pot or casserole dish by placing a portion of the beans in the bottom of dish, and layering them with bacon and onion.
In a saucepan, combine molasses, salt, pepper, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and liquid smoke. Bring the mixture to a boil and pour over beans. Pour in just enough of the reserved bean water to cover the beans. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until beans are tender. Remove the lid about halfway through cooking, and add more liquid if necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry.
