Ingredients:
Cake:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup amaretto-cream-flavored hot cocoa mix
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/8 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, hot cocoa mix, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.
Beat white sugar and 1 cup butter together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Mix in 1 cup sour cream, milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
Beat flour mixture into sour cream mixture gradually, on low speed, until just blended. Spoon batter into 16 mini fluted tube pan molds (such as Bundt(R)), filling each 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
Cool cakes in pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove from pans; cool completely before frosting, 10 to 15 minutes.
Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 tablespoons sour cream, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar gradually; beat frosting until smooth. Frost the cooled cakes.
