Ingredients:
2 1/2 c. flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp. salt
1 1/4 c. sugar
1 c. (2 sticks) butter, softened
1 egg
2 tsp. vanilla extract
Cookie Icing

Directions:
MIX - flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Beat sugar and butter in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla; mix well. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until well mixed. Refrigerate 2 hours or overnight until firm.
ROLL - out dough on lightly floured surface to 1/8th inch thickness. Cut into shapes with cookie cutters. Place on greased baking sheets. (We used parchment without greasing and it worked just fine).
BAKE - in preheated 375 F. oven 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on baking sheets 1 minute. Remove to wire racks; cool completely. Decorate cookies with icing and decorations. Place on wire rack to dry.

Description: 
I found this recipe in a magazine and wondered how good it might be. I don't care for cut out sugar cookies with no taste, so I gave it a try. Wow! Was I surprised to find that these were very flavorful and crispy. They are now our favorite Holiday cookie!
