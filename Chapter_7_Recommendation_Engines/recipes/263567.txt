Ingredients:
3 large eggs
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup diced smoked ham
2 tablespoons diced onion
2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Beat eggs until just combined; do not over-beat.
Melt butter in a skillet over high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper. Sprinkle in a nice pinch of salt and a touch of pepper. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start to soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along the edges of the omelet.
Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over the omelet. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Fold omelet in half with your spatula and transfer to a plate.

Description: 
A change of pace from a French omelet, the Denver omelet is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I've ever learned to cook professionally, as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.
