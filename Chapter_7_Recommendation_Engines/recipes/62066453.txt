Ingredients:
1 pkg. Candy Melts (I use Wilton)
Candy flavoring of your choice (Optional)(I use Wilton)
Pretzles (any kind can be used)
1 TBS. shortening

Directions:
Melt Candy Melts according to directions on package.  If you choose to use chocolate chips, melt them in a deep bowl or a glass measuring cup.  Melt for 1 min. on 50% power in the microwave.  Stir.  Follow by melting in 30 second incruments on 50% power, stirring between, until melted.  Once the chocolate is melted, add the flavoring of your choice (optional).  For pretzle sticks:  Holding the end of the pretzle stick dip it into the chocolate as high as you can.  Lay this on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper.  Repeat as neccessary.  For regular pretzles:  Using a fork, dip the pretzles into the chocolate and then lay flat on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper.  To make them colored, use white candy melts and add either food coloring or Wilton chocolate coloring.  Let these cool in the fridge until hardened.  If you want to add an extra special touch, try melting chocolate of a different color and drizzling it over the pretzles after they have cooled then placing them back in the fridge to cool again.
