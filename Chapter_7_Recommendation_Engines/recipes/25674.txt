Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 large green bell pepper, sliced
1/2 large onion, sliced
1 pound baby carrots
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound cubed beef
3 pounds white potatoes, thickly sliced
1 1/2 quarts water
5 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled

Directions:
In a large, deep skillet over medium heat, cook bell pepper, onion, carrots and mushrooms in butter, until onion is translucent.  Stir in garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and beef.  Cover and cook over low heat until vegetables are softened and meat is browned, stirring frequently.
Meanwhile, place potatoes in a 2-quart saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15 minutes.  Drain and stir potatoes into vegetable mixture.
Pour 1 1/2 quarts water into the 2-quart saucepan and dissolve the bouillon in the water.  Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
In a large mixing bowl or stock pot, carefully combine broth and vegetable mixture until well combined.  Serve hot.
