Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
4 cups sliced apples
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan.
Mix 3 cups all-purpose flour, white sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, salt, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Beat eggs in a separate large bowl; add vegetable oil, buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture; stir together with a large spoon. Fold apples and pecans into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes. Cool cake in pan.
Cook and stir margarine and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons flour; stir constantly until combined. Stir in milk and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Cook and stir until thickened, 5 minutes.
Invert cake onto a plastic cake carrier or container; poke holes over entire cake using a knife. Pour hot icing over entire cake. Pour any remaining icing into the center of the cake. The icing will absorb into the cake overnight.

Description: 
I store my cake in a plastic cake carrier turned upside down. The icing will run off, therefore a regular cake plate will not work unless you have one with high sides. This cake is much better the day after. It is so very moist. It is even better if you put your slice in the microwave for 10 seconds to just have it warm. My family would disown me if I did not have this cake for holiday get-togethers. Nothing better with a cup of coffee.
