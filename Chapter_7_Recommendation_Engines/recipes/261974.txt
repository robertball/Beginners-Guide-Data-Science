Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups gluten-free crisp gingersnap cookies
7 tablespoons coconut oil, melted, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place cookies in a food processor or blender; pulse into fine crumbs.
Pour cookie crumbs into a bowl. Drizzle 5 tablespoons coconut oil on top; mix well with a fork. Add 1 tablespoon coconut oil if mixture doesn't hold together. Press mixture into a pie plate to create a crust. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool before filling.

Description: 
A gluten-free version of cookie crumb crust for pies. I've made this with butter cookies, graham crackers, animal crackers, and even vegan cookies. This recipe makes one 9-inch pie crust. If using for a pie that needs to be baked, making sure it is only lightly browned, or it may burn when re-baking.
