Ingredients:
10 ounces sirloin steak tips
10 ounces beef brisket, trimmed of fat, cut into small chunks
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 shallot, minced
1/4 cup wild game rub (see footnote)
4 whole wheat hot dog buns
4 slices white Cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Condiments:
Lettuce leaves
Sliced tomatoes
Chopped onion
Relish

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine the sirloin and brisket in a food processor and pulse until ground.
Transfer the meat into a large bowl. Add the mayonnaise, shallot, and wild game rub; gently mix.
Divide the meat  into 4 equal portions; shape the "burgers" into hotdog shapes.
Place on preheated grill and close the lid. Cook for 4 minutes. Lift lid; flip burger dogs and close lid.
Lightly toast hot dog buns, then set aside.
Sear the burger dogs on all four sides for extra char flavor, about 2 1/2 minutes per side for medium, or until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F. During the final minute of grilling, top each burger dog with a slice of cheese.
Transfer burger dogs from the grill to a grill bun. Salt and pepper to taste; serve with your favorite condiments.
