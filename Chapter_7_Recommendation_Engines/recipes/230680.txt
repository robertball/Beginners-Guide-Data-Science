Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 (1-inch thick) boneless pork loin chops
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup margarine
1 (6 ounce) package pork stuffing mix
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling with cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; brown pork chops in the hot oil, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Bring water and margarine to a boil in a saucepan; add stuffing mix and cover. Remove saucepan from heat and let stand 5 minutes to absorb water. Remove cover and fluff stuffing with a fork.
Spread apple pie filling into the prepared baking dish; layer pork chops onto pie filling layer. Spoon stuffing over pork chops. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and cook until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
