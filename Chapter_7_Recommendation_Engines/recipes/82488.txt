Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 zucchini, cut into 1/4 inch slices
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
salt and pepper to taste
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup sun-dried tomato pesto
3 eggs
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 10 inch springform pan with parchment paper.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the Italian sausage; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain well and reserve.
Heat the olive oil the skillet over medium heat. Stir in zucchini and garlic; cook until zucchini is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir basil into the skillet; cover and simmer until zucchini is soft, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cool slightly; place in a square of cheesecloth or a colander and squeeze dry.
Use one can of crescent dough to form a crust in the springform pan, pressing dough up sides. Layer 1/2 cup mozzarella , the cooked zucchini, the cooked sausage, and the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella in the crust.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; dot with the pesto. Beat the eggs, cream, and paprika in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper.  Pour egg mixture over layered ingredients in crust. Place remaining crescent dough, in one piece, on top of pan to form a top crust. Trim; poke hole in the middle to vent.
Place pan on a baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil; bake an additional 15 minutes. Turn off oven; allow pie to rest in warm oven for 20 minutes. Serve warm, or refrigerate for at least 3 hours to serve chilled.
