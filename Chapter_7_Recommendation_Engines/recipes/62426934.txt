Description: 
This dish is made all in one pot. Great for a crowd, & easily adaptable for smaller portions. Serve it with coleslaw & crusty bread, if desired. You can omit the crab claws, & just do a simple corn, potato & shrimp boil. 

Serve with butter (for potatoes and corn), salt, Tabasco, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges, crusty bread, & plenty of napkins, & dig in.
