Ingredients:
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 ripe banana, mashed
1 cup fresh raspberries, cut into small pieces
1 cup dark chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or fill with paper liners.
Mix almond meal, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat butter and sugar together in a separate bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one by one, beating until each is incorporated. Stir vanilla into the butter mixture.
Mix milk and yogurt together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture, alternating with milk mixture, to the flour mixture until just incorporated. Stir mashed banana into batter; fold in raspberries and chocolate chips. Fill muffin cups 3/4-full with batter.
Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
These muffins came about when I was trying to create a somewhat healthy muffin for my son to eat that used up ingredients I had. I've made them twice so far, and every time they are gone within 30 minutes and got rave reviews.
