Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons hot water
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
10 drops green food coloring, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs. Stir in vanilla extract and peppermint extract. Dissolve baking soda in hot water and mix into the batter.
Combine flour, salt, and cream of tartar in a separate bowl. Add to the batter gradually; mix well. Stir in chocolate chips.
Drop spoonfuls of batter onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 1 minute; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
