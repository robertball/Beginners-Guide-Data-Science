Ingredients:
2/3 cup Hellmann’s Lite mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Hellmann’s Dijonnaise
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon smoked Spanish paprika (or sweet paprika)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 green onions (green and pale green part), thinly sliced
1 cup diced celery
3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
8 hard cooked eggs, peeled and coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons olive oil
8 slices whole grain or whole wheat bread
1/2 small onion, thinly sliced
Parsley leaves, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the mayonnaise, Dijonnaise, and paprika in a large bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup of the mayonnaise. Add the green onion, parsley, celery and eggs to the remaining mayonnaise and gently fold to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste.
Brush the bread on both sides with some of the oil and grill on a grill or grill pan until lightly golden brown or place on a baking sheet and place under the broiler for 45 seconds per side.
Spread some of the reserved mayonnaise on each slice of bread. Divide the egg salad among the 8 slices of bread, top with slices of onion and a few parsley leaves.
