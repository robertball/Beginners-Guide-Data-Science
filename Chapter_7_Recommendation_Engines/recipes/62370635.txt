Ingredients:
5 cups old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup toasted wheat germ (I buy at Target or Whole Foods)
1 cup coarsely chopped almonds
1/2 cup flaxseed
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
1 cup honey
8 Tbs unsalted butter (I cut it down to 4)
1/2 cup each golden raisins & cranberries

Directions:
Heat oven to 300.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  In large bowl toss together oats through nutmeg. In a separate bowl melt butter.  Add honey to melted butter and stir until combined.   Pour honey mixture over oat mixture and stir well. Bake until golden brown about 20 min (watch it closely usually somewhere between 17 - 20 min with my oven.
Let cool and break up into smaller pieces.  Mix in dried fruit.  Store in air tight container.
