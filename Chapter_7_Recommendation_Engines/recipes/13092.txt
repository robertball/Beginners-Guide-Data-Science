Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 onion, finely diced
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
6 ounces tomato paste
1 (16 ounce) can chili beans, drained
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain excess fat, and crumble. Stir in onion, green pepper, tomato sauce, tomato paste and chili beans. Season with chili powder, hot sauce, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and garlic powder.
Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until desired consistency (at least 1 hour for best flavor).

Description: 
This makes a very thick chili. For a thinner chili, omit the tomato paste. For a chili soup, omit tomato paste and sauce and use 1 can (16 ounces) tomatoes with liquid and add 1/2 cup water and 1 beef bouillon cube.
