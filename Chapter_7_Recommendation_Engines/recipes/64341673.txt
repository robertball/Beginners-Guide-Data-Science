Ingredients:
One Cup Milk, Yogurt or Kefir
2 Cups Boiling Water
3 T Oil or butter
1/2 Cup warm water
2 T (Scant) yeast
4 T plus 1 teaspoon sugar
1 T plus 1 teaspoon salt
8 Cups Flour

Directions:
Pour boiling water over the milk or yogurt. Add the butter.
Dissolve yeast in the warm water.  When bubbly and the water/milk mixture is 120 degrees or less, add the yeast, salt, sugar and flour to the milk mixture.
Knead until smooth.
Let rise until doubled.
Make into four loaves.
Let rise about 1/2 and hour.
Bake at 400 degrees on stone if you have it, for about 30 minutes.
When you put it in the oven, toss a cup or so of ice into the bottom of the oven. The steam from it will help to form a nice crust on the bread.
