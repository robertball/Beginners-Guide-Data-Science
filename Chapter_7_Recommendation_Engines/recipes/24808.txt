Ingredients:
2 pita breads
8 leaves romaine lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces
2 green onions, chopped
1 cucumber, chopped
3 tomatoes, cut into wedges
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons sumac powder
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toast pitas 5 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until crisp. Remove from heat, and break into bite size pieces.
In a large bowl, toss together toasted pita pieces, romaine lettuce, green onions, cucumber, and tomatoes.
In a small bowl, mix the parsley, garlic, sumac powder, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and mint. Pour over the pita mixture, and toss just before serving.

Description: 
Sumac is available at Middle Eastern food stores. It may be left out of this salad, but the flavor to me is important to the overall taste.
