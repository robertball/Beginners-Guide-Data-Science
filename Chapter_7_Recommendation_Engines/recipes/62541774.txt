Ingredients:
(Double recipe for a 9X13 pan)
3 cups sweet potatoes cooked
2 eggs
1/2 cup melted butter
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup sugar (I have never put this in)
Topping:
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup flour

Directions:
Mix first ingredients and place in square baking dish, or 9X13 if doubled.  Mix topping ingredients, preferrably with hands.  Will be like a moist cornmeal.  Spread on top and bake for 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees.  Can easily make the day before and bake the next day
