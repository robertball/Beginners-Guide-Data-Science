Description: 
Well, my mother in law, being the treasure trove of Peruvian cooking wisdom that she is, has given me another fabulous original recipe that I could modify a bit... there is no better way to use vast quantities of seasonal zucchini or yellow squash for a healthy, light and utterly delicious dish.
