Description: 
This is a healthy stick to your ribs breakfast.I found it in a magazine 35 years ago and have made it ever since. Now my kids are grown and gone, but I have given it to them when they were away at college, and as a gift in an attractive jar. I have not found a better recipe.  So delicious and a very nice presentation!
