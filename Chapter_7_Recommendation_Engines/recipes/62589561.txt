Ingredients:
12 oz. pasta
4 tbsp. butter
2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, cut into 2" pieces
1 10oz. pkg. frozen peas
2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
2 oz. thinly sliced prosciutto, cut into thin strips
2 oz. ricotta salata or Parmesan, shaved

Directions:
Cook pasta until al dente, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water.
Heat 1 tbsp. butter in large skillet, add leeks and season with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally until tender, about 3-5 min.
Add peas and cook until warmed through, about 2-3in.
Add leeks mixture to drained pasta, then add remaining butter, lemon juice and prosciutto.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add reserved pasta water a little at a time until a thin sauce coats pasta.  Serve garnished with cheese.
