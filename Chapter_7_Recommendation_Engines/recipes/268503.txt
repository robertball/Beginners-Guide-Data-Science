Ingredients:
1/2 cup gluten-free corn flakes
1/4 cup potato starch
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 egg
2 (8 ounce) balls fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into wedges
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place corn flakes in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crushed.
Combine crushed corn flakes, potato starch, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning in a shallow dish. Beat egg in a second shallow dish.
Dip mozzarella cheese pieces first in egg, then in the corn flake mixture.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add breaded mozzarella cheese; fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a baking pan lined with a wire rack to drain excess grease.
