Ingredients:
8 ounces Italian sausage links
2 1/4 cups water, divided
1 pound shell-on medium shrimp
3 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 cup chopped onions
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1 cup long-grain white rice
1/4 cup Chateau Ste. Michelle Syrah Ros√©
1/3 cup frozen peas
Salt and pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Boil sausage in 1/4 cup water for 5 minutes. While the sausage is boiling, remove the shells from the shrimp. Put shells and tails in 2 cups of water. Bring shrimp water to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.
Grill the sausage links for about 5 minutes or until they are completely cooked through. Brush the shrimp with 1/2 tablespoon oil and grill about 2 minutes per side. Pull off and set aside.
Heat a medium pot on medium high heat and add vegetable oil, onions, and red pepper. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until the onions are translucent. Add Cajun seasoning and rice; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the Syrah Rose, stir for a few seconds, and strain the shrimp stock into the pot. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat down to a simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, chop the shrimp and sausage into bite-sized pieces.
Once rice is done, add peas, shrimp, and sausage and cook for another 2 minutes to heat through. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Garnish with chopped green onions.
