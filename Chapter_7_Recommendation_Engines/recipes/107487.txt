Ingredients:
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons fresh ginger root, grated
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground clove
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
2 limes, zested and juiced
1 cup orange juice
1 rack pork spareribs, cut in half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together the brown sugar, ginger, cayenne, clove, cinnamon, paprika, oregano, pepper, salt, and lime zest; set aside.  Squeeze the limes, and add the juice to the orange juice.  Rub the ribs well with the spice mixture.  Place into a glass baking dish, and pour in the juice.
Cover the dish, and bake in preheated oven for 90 minutes.  Uncover, then continue cooking until nicely colored, 20 to 30 minutes more.  Brush the ribs with the pan juices a few times while they are cooking.
