Description: 
Kung Pao Chicken (Chinese Name: Gong Bao Ji Ding) is one of most common dishes you will see in almost any Chinese restaurant, and you may see it made with different ingredients. The most original one I have seen was with green onion only and no other vegetables. Today I am making it with vegetables, which reminds me of the very first time I had Kung Pao Chicken.
