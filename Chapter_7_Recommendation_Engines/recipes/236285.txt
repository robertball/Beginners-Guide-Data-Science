Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
Â¼ cup butter
5 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
4 pounds chicken wings, tips removed and wings cut in half at joint

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Stir wing sauce and vinegar into melted butter until fully incorporated and heated through.
Working in batches, cook chicken wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer cooked wings to hot sauce mixture and turn to coat completely. Leave wings in sauce for 2 to 3 minutes to soak up flavors. Remove to a serving plate.
