Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup HERSHEY®'S Dutch Processed Cocoa
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sliced almonds
1 cup HERSHEY®'S Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1 tablespoon shortening
1/4 cup HERSHEY®'S Premier White Chips
1 teaspoon shortening

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 F.  Beat butter and sugar in large bowl until well blended.  Add eggs and almond extract; beat until smooth.  Stir together flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; gradually add to butter mixture, beating until smooth.  (Dough will be thick.)  Stir in almonds with wooden spoon.
Divide dough in half.  With lightly floured hands, shape each half into rectangular log about 2 inches in diameter and 11 inches long; place on large ungreased cookie sheet, at least 2 inches apart.
Bake 30 minutes or until logs are set.  Remove from oven; cool on cookie sheet 15 minutes.  Using serrated knife, cut logs diagonally using a sawing motion, into 1/2-inch thick slices.  Discard end pieces.  Arrange slices, cut sides down, close together on cookie sheet.
Bake 8 to 9 minutes.  Turn slices over; bake an additional 8 to 9 minutes.  Remove from oven; cool on cookie sheet on wire rack.  Dip end of each biscotti in Chocolate Glaze or drizzle glaze over entire cookie.  Drizzle White Glaze over chocolate glaze.  Garnish with additional almonds, if desired.  About 2-1/2 dozen cookies.
Chocolate Glaze:  Place 1 cup Hershey's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips and 1 tablespoon shortening (do not use butter, margarine, oil or spread) in small microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 to 1-1/2 minutes or until smooth when stirred.  About 1 cup glaze.    White Glaze:  Place 1/4 cup Hershey's Premier White Chips and 1 teaspoon shortening (do not use butter, margarine, oil or spread) in small microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 30 to 45 seconds or until smooth when stirred.  About 1/4 cup glaze.
