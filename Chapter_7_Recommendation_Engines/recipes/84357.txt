Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
4 1/2-inch thick pork chops
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
5 tablespoons vinegar
1 1/4 cups sour cream
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
3/4 teaspoon crushed dried summer savory
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Press pork chops in the mixture to coat.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the pork chops on both sides. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, whisk together the chicken broth, vinegar, sour cream, sugar, savory, and bay leaves. Arrange the pork chops in the prepared baking dish. Pour sauce over the pork chops.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven.

Description: 
This is a recipe my Grandma Margie has been making for the past 40 years and it's our favorite pork chop recipe. They're kind of sweet and kind of sour, but absolutely wonderful!  You can also substitute 6 ounces of cream cheese for the sour cream if that's what you have on hand, in which case you should bake the dish covered. These chops are great served with rice pilaf, mashed potatoes, or over pasta, with a salad on the side. Enjoy!
