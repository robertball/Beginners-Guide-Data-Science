Ingredients:

Directions:
Bring the fettuccini to boil until cooked and drain.
Fry the onion on a large pan until golden brown. Add the ground beef to the onion and let it cook for a few minutes, while breaking it into small pieces. Add vegetables, mushrooms, green pepper, spices and salt, and let it simmer on a medium to low heat.
On a large baking pan, spread 1/3 of the fettuccini to the bottom. Add the meat, mushroom soup and cheese one at a time. Repeat the process until obtaining a layered creamy fettuccini with meat. Place in oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.
