Ingredients:
1/2 cup garbanzo bean flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup water

Directions:
Stir the garbanzo bean flour, oats, cornmeal, cinnamon, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the water until only small lumps remain.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat until a drop of water skitters across the surface. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until  the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Beans and grains combined make a nice combination.  This recipe was developed for those on a wheat sensitive diet who can have gluten.  It's great for people who need to be dairy and egg free. These do not form bubbles on the first side like 'normal' wheat pancakes. They do not brown like regular pancakes, either.
