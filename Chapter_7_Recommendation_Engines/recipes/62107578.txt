Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil.
1 onion, chopped.
1 garlic clove, crushed.
1/2 kg lean minced beef.
1 glass red wine.
1 can chopped tomatoes.
1 1/2 tbsp tomato puree.
1 red chilli, or 2 tsp red chilli flakes.
1/2 tsp ground cumin.
1/2 tsp ground coriander.
1/2 stick cinnamon.
Good shake of Worcestershire sauce.
1/2 beef stock cube.
1 can red kidney beans.
Few coriander leaves, roughly chopped.
Salt and pepper, to season.

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large heavy-based saucepan and fry the onion and garlic until softened.
Increase the heat and add the mince, cooking quickly until browned.
Pour in the wine and boil for 2-3 minutes.
Stir in the tinned tomatoes, tomato puree, fresh chilli or chilli flakes, cumin, ground coriander, cinnamon and Worcestershire sauce and crumble in the stock cube. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook over a gentle heat for about an hour, stirring occasionally until the mixture is rich and thickened.
Add the kidney beans and fresh coriander. Cook for a further 10 minutes, uncovered, before removing the heat and adding any extra seasoning if necessary.

Description: 
This yummy chilli is great served with rice or over jacket potatoes, accompanied by crusty bread, guacamole, sour cream, lime wedges and a big green salad. This recipe is best enjoyed a day or two after it is cooked as the flavours develop and the texture becomes richer. You can leave it in the fridge after cooling and then heat before serving. The recipe can also be frozen. Enjoy!
