Emilia's Cuban Black Beans Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound dried black beans, rinsed
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 cup chopped parsley
1/2 cup pimento-stuffed Spanish Queen olives, sliced
1/4 pound (uncooked) bacon, chopped (Or pick up pre-cut raw bacon bits from your butcher)
2 Tablespoons Fresh Oregano (or 1 Tbsp dried)
Kosher Salt to taste
1 Tablespoon Cumin
1 Tablespoon Black Pepper
Juice of 1 lime
2 bay leaves
2 annatto seeds
1 medium yellow onion, diced
5 garlic cloves, crushed

Directions:
In a large pot, brown the bacon with the annatto seeds, retaining the renderings
Using the bacon grease, sautee onions, garlic, parsley and half of the cilantro for approximately 5 minutes, allow to cool
Add in beans, bay leaves, salt, lime juice, cumin, oregano, pepper, and fill pot 3/4 of the way to top with water, bring to a boil, cover and then reduce heat, allowing beans to simmer until the beans are tender-about 3 1/2  hours (in crock pot use High setting /for 2 hours and Low for 3)
In the last half hour, add the sliced olives and the remainder of the cilantro for additional flavor (depending on your preferred consistency, you may want to remove the cover to allow some of the water to evaporate at this point, especially if using a crock pot!)
When desired consistency is reached, serve over white rice, and sprinkle with chopped parsley for color.

Description: 
My mother-in law made these often when I lived in Miami before her death.  After reading the other recipes on here, I found they all missed one very important ingredient for authenticity-PORK! This recipe takes a while to cook, and I have also used a crock pot with good results for those who enjoy using them. Hope you enjoy!
