Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 clove garlic, minced
2 naan breads
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine butter and garlic in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Spread butter mixture over 1 side of each bread and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Reduce grill heat to low and place bread, butter-side down, onto grill. Cook until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes, moving bread around every 15 to 20 seconds and watching for flare-ups.
Turn bread over and sprinkle evenly with mozzarella cheese. Close grill and cook until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet, cut each bread into quarters, and serve warm.

Description: 
This takes only minutes to make and is perfect to throw on the grill just before serving dinner. I like to make this with different cheeses, such as Parmesan or Gruyere, or whatever I happen to have on hand. Keep an eye on it constantly, as it tends to burn easily!
