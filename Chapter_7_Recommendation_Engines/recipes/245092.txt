1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or more to taste), for garnish

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook ground sausage until browned, breaking it up into small pieces, about 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to a bowl. Drain fat from skillet; wipe out skillet with a paper towel.
Melt butter in skillet over medium heat, Stir in onion and saute until translucent, 2 or 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Whisk in flour until evenly mixed into butter, 1 minute.
