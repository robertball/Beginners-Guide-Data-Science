Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1/4 cup butter or margarine
3 cups milk
2/3 cup cornmeal
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2 egg yolks, beaten
7 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions:
In a large saucepan, saute the onion and red pepper in butter until tender. Add the milk. Bring to a boil. Gradually whisk in cornmeal; whisk constantly until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cheese, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper. Add 1 cup of the cornmeal mixture to the egg yolks; mix well. Return all to saucepan.
In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and remaining salt until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cornmeal mixture. Transfer to a greased 2-qt. souffle dish. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
I use the vegetables from our garden in all my cooking. Dotted with parsley and red pepper, this souffle is a favorite.                                         --Janet Eckhoff, Woodland, California
