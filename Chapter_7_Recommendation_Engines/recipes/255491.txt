Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix with pudding
1 cup chopped nuts

Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Mix pumpkin, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, and cinnamon together in a bowl; spread in the prepared baking pan. Pour cake mix on top. Pat chopped nuts into surface. Spoon melted butter evenly over nuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Allow cake to cool completely, about 1 hour. Turn over onto a baking sheet; remove parchment paper.
Mix cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and whipped topping together in a bowl. Spread onto cake.

Description: 
This tastes a bit like pumpkin cheesecake on a sugar cookie crust, but the ingredients may surprise you (they did me!). This was served at a holiday party and everyone kept going back for more.
