Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan.
Sift flour with sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in cornmeal.
Beat eggs briefly in another bowl; add milk and melted butter. Pour into the flour mixture and stir just until moist. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cornbread comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.

Description: 
I don't know if cornbread was ever designed to be baked above sea level, but this recipe creates lighter but sturdy cornbread. This is not a light-as-air muffin, but dang is it good!
