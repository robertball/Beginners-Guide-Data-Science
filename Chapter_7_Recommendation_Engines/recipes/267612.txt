Ingredients:
1 cup whole mung beans
1 cup basmati rice
8 cups water
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground fenugreek seeds
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon asafoetida powder

Directions:
Soak mung beans in water for at least 4 hours. Soak basmati rice for at least 10 minutes. Drain and rinse mung beans and rice, separately, until water runs clear.
Place mung beans in a large pot. Cover with 8 cups water; bring to a gentle boil. Cook for 10 minutes. Add rice, salt, fenugreek, pepper, turmeric, and asafoetida powder. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently until water is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat; keep covered and let stand for up to 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Khichdi is a lovely comfort food often served for breakfast, but I find it makes a wonderful side dish with a curry or salad, or a light main dish. I have eaten khichdis prepared by Indian friends that were like porridge, with the mung beans and rice indistinguishable because it was cooked until almost smooth. My husband prefers it more like a pilaf, with mung beans speckled among seasoned grains of rice. Serve hot with butter, ghee, or chopped cilantro.
