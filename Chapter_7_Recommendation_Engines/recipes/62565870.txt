Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1 cup corn syrup
2 cups sugar
1- 2 c. Spanish peanuts (raw)
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine water, corn syrup, peanuts, sugar and salt in a heavy 4-quart saucepan.
Put in the candy thermometer and cook over high heat.   Stir frequently until temperature reaches 290 degrees.
Remove from heat and add the soda. Mixture will foam up. Stir thoroughly, then gradually stir in coconut.
Pour onto buttered cookie sheets (2 regular or 1 large) with rims.  Pull or stretch with well oiled forks.
Let cool completely, then break into pieces.

Description: 
Although this is not her exact recipe, this is similar to the one found in Grandma Helms' recipe box. Her's was only a list of ingredients. She made it every Christmas, so she must have known the instructions by heart.
