Ingredients:
1 cup white cornmeal
1 cup gluten-free baking flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup 2% milk
1/3 cup low-salt butter, melted
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 8x13-inch glass dish.
Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl. Add milk, melted butter, and egg; whisk until well combined. Pour batter into the glass dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn oven off and leave bread inside for a golden brown finish, 2 to 3 minutes more.
