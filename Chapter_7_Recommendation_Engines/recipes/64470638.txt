Ingredients:
1 egg white
30g icing sugar
Enough kale as you dare
1 pretty cupcake case
2 bottles nicely chilled white wine

Directions:
1.Take your egg out of the fridge as it needs to be at room temperature.  Although what does room temperature even mean?  What if your room is in the Arctic or on the surface of the sun, HUH?! I bet you hadn't thought of THAT.  Anyway, moving on.
2. Pour yourself a nice glass of wine - I recommend a Pinot Grigio.
3. Separate the egg white from the yolk. Whisk the white until it forms stiff peaks. I don't care what you do with the yolk, that's up to you. Howabout wrapping it up as a nice (if runny) present for your favourite elopus?
4. How about another glass of wine?  Go on, you deserve it after all that Gishing you've been doing this week...  Cheers!
5.  Slowly add the icing sugar to the egg white. NO, NOT THAT FAST!!!  Slower... slower... a bit slower still...  yep, you've got it.
7.  Wait, what happened to No.6?!
6.  Ah, there it is.
8. Anyone fancy another glass?  I know I do... oh, the bottle's finished.  I'll open another one, hang on...
9.  Is it jusht me or ish thish kitchen starting to spin a little?
10. Shove the egg and sugarythingy mixshure inna the oven. I not sure what the temperashur should be...   jush make sure ish in until ish cooked...
11. I's have a little nap now... Zzzz...
12. Take the Fluffy Bite out of the oven and sprinkle liberally with kale.  It is ESSENTIAL that you curse Misha Collins' twisted mind at this point.
Enjoy!
