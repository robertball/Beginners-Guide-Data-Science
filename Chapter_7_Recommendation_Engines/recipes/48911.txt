Ingredients:
3 pounds pork shoulder, trimmed and cubed
1 clove garlic
1 tablespoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
sausage casings

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the pork, garlic, salt and pepper. Place on a clean smooth surface and knead, knead, knead for at least 10 or 15 minutes. The longer you knead it, the more tender your sausage will be.
Soak the sausage casings in water for 1 or 2 minutes. Rinse the casings by sliding over the faucet. Slide the casing all the way up onto the spout of a sausage stuffing funnel. Press meat through the funnel into the casing carefully so that no air bubbles get inside. Sausages should be plump. Twist periodically to form links.
Place sausages in a large pot with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. They can be frozen after cooling. Use as you would store bought Polish Sausage.

Description: 
My Busia taught me this recipe. What more can I say? This is REAL, old fashioned polish sausage. Busia always said kneading the meat by hand made the sausage more tender than using a meat grinder.
