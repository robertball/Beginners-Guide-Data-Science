Description: 
Sick and tired of trying bottle after bottle of dressing, and not finding anything that came even close to my favorite restaurant-inspired salad, this recipe allows me to have simple, delicious salad anytime, with only a few simple ingredients. Tastes amazing on salad with fruit (apples are my favorite), or even as a bread dip!
