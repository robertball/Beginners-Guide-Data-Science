Ingredients:
1-1½ lbs. Boneless pork chops
¼ c Soy sauce
¼ c Heinz ketchup
¼ c Water
¼ c Rice vinegar
2 T Hoisin sauce
2 T Honey
1 T Ground mustard
2 tsp. Ground Ginger
1 tsp. Sriracha chili sauce
3 Garlic cloves
1 Mandarin orange fruit cup, drained

Directions:
Rinse and dry pork, set in a large zip lock bag or dish for marinating.
In a blender or food processor, combine all of the other ingredients, and blend very well.  Pour about half of the sauce/marinade on to the pork, making sure it is coated well.  Marinate pork for at least an hour in the refrigerator, the longer the better.
Pour the remaining sauce/marinade into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often, until the sauce thickens.  Use this sauce to brush on the pork during the last half of grilling.
