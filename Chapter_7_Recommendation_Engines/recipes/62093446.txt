Ingredients:
1-1 1/5 pounds ground beef
1 can kidney beans
1 bag of lettuce
2 medium tomatoes (diced)
1 small can of chopped black olives
1 package of Doritos Cool Ranch Chips
2 cups Mexican Chedder Cheese
1/2 cup salsa (I prefer Herdez)
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef. Kick it up a few notches and add a little garlic salt and pepper. Drain the excess fat and return to the stove and add the kidney beans and taco seasoning with 3/4 cup water. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer for 5-7 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and olives. When the meat has finished cooking drain any excess liquid and add to the salad mixture.
In a seperate bowl, combine the sour cream and salsa and mix thoroughly.
Add the sauce to the salad and mix well.
Add crushed chips to your salad once you've served yourself. The amount of chips is up to you.
