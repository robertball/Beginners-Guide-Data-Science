Ingredients:
- 1/2 pound ground chicken or turkey
- 1 pound of ground pork
- 1 small onion minced
- 1/2 cup of boiling water
- 1 clove of garlic, chopped
- 1.5 teaspoons of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon celery salt
- 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon sage
- pinch of ground cloves
- 2 potatoes
- enough pastry for a 2-crust, 9 inch pie

Directions:
In a heavy 3 quart saucepan combine all ingredients except potatoes.
Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly until the meat loses its redness and about half of the liquid has evaporated. Cover and cook for 45 minutes longer.
Meanwhile, boil and mash 3 medium sized potatoes. Mix the mashed potatoes into the meat mixture and cool. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Roll out half the dough and line a deep 9-inch pie plate. Fill with the cooled meat mixture and cover with the remaining dough. Seal the edges and make a cut in the top crust with a sharp knife. Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for 30-40 minutes longer.

Description: 
These wonderful meat pies are a Christmas tradition, that has been in our family  for years. Making 20 of these a year is a multi-generational holiday tradition for our family. It's the most authentic to the original made with Pigeon that I have ever had.
