Very good and very easy to make.  I used regular bacon, and didn't have any pearl onion, so i just used regular chopped.  Everyone in my house really liked this.  Thank you!!

I found this recipe because I had some canadian bacon to use up.  I love onions but hate pearl onions so just chopped a walla walla sweet and cooked with the bacon.  Was surprised at how good this was.

Used chopped white onion instead of pearl, bacon bits instead of Canadian bacon. Was a hit! Will definitely make it again.

My whole family loved this dish!  For the first time ever, we ate all our green peas and wanted more.  I improvised a bit by using onion powder instead of onions, and it was still delicious.

This was really good, although I made some changes. I used purchased crumbled bacon and onion powder in place of pearl onions, only because my husband hates onions. May try adding some fresh mushrooms or asparagus to the mix.

The flavors blended well.  Peas are not my families favorite side dish, which may account for only 3stars.

I liked these a lot. I had some pearl onions I wanted to use up and this was perfect. The only change I will make next time is adding a shot of tabasco to give it a little zip

Tasty little dish. I used a Texas sweet onion diced instead of pearl onions and I cooked them in with the canadian bacon. We really liked these and I will be fixing this recipe again. Thanks Marlene!
