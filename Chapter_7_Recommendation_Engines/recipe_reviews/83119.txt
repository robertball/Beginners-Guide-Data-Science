I liked this recipie. however the other reviewers said they couldn't find canned apples. I believe they could also be referred to as apple pie filling. At least that's what I used and it worked for me.

Canned apples? Not only couldn't I find them, the store manager had never heard of them. I used sliced fresh apples, but the pork came out bland and tasteless -- more poached than sauteed. The apples produce too much liquid, and it's all too easy to overcook the pork. If you try this recipe, be sure to drain off the excess liquid during those final 5-6 minutes.
