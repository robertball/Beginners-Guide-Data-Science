Totally awesome fudge.  Just a tip for first-timers, make sure to slightly crush cookies by hand.  If ground too much, the fudge will turn into a gross grey colour and taste gritty. Overall, extremely easy.

quick and easy and something different than the standard fudge.  I used 3 cups of Nestle's white chocolate chips and no-brand sweetened condensed milk with  great results.  Fudge set up perfectly.  I had the holiday oreos with the red cream centers.  Heated until chips were just melted then gently folded in the cookies.  It made a red/white marbled affect; very pretty and festive.  Thanks for the great tip of not crushing too fine.  Cut each cookie with a serated knife and threw away all the fine crumbs.  Nice texture.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I made a change to this one. Instead of using oreo cookies. I used a few tablespoons of rasberry jelly and swilled it into the chocolate. My sister and her friends loved it.

We made it ORANGE! My 6 year old son has to bring a "Non-messy" special treat to school this week for the whole class. Being that it's almost Halloween, I wanted something fun and yummy, but not cupcakes or sugar cookies like everyone else brings. After melting the chocolate and condensed milk, I added about 12 drops of yellow food coloring and 5 drops or red, and mixed it well, then folded in the cookies. I found it was easier to break the cookies by hand into 4 or 5 pieces than to cut them, that made more crumbs. I also used a 9x13 pan so it's easier to cut small portions.  If you are making this for a lot of people (more than 20 kids or 10 adults) then you may want to double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan. Also, spread into the pan while it's still a little warm! Mine wouldn't spread out nicely, so I put a sheet of wax paper on top and then pressed across that to spread it evenly, and that worked wonderfully.

Awesome!  Very easy and super delicious.  Check to make sure what you're using is white chocolate and not "vanilla milk" whatever.  White chocolate will have cocoa butter in it.

WOW!  This recipe was divine!  It literally took five minutes to slap together!  It tastes just like those Hershey's Cookies n Cream chocolate bars.  My husband even said it was really good and he doesn't like sweet things and he doesn't like Oreos!  This was a great recipe and I will make it again and again.  just writing about it makes me want to eat another piece!

Yummy!  This will become a tradition!  My husband said it tasted like the inside of an oreo.  The only thing I would change would be to put it in a 9x13 pan to make it easier to cut into small pieces.

This recipe is delicious!!! Just don't forget to break apart the sandwich cookies by hand. Don't crush them in a plastic bag by banging the cookies with something (like a cup.) It will make the presentation not so good. Break each cookie in about 4 or 5 pieces and leave it. Trust me, it makes for better looking (and non gritty) fudge. I made this for a family birthday party, and everyone kept going back for more. My grandpa (who rarely eats any sweets), wanted to fill up a container for himself to eat! Many of my friends find this fudge addictive, and I have to agree. Excellent recipe.

This recipe was incredibly quick and delicious!  I will be making this fudge again for Christmas.  I used 18 ounces (or approximately 3 cups) of Nestle white chocolate chips, a 14 ounce can of Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, a pinch of salt and about 1/2 of a 1 lb. 2 oz. package of Oreo cookies.  I broke each Oreo in 4 to 5 pieces while the other ingredients were melting together over low heat.  Once the chocolate chips were completely melted, I gently folded in the broken Oreo cookies.  I poured the fudge into an 8x4 inch bread pan which I lined with aluminum foil and sprayed lightly with cooking spray.  The result was a tall fudge like the kind you see at fudge shops.  This recipe was incredible and I love the simplicity of the preparation.  Tastes just like Hershey's Cookies 'N' Cream bars, only better!

It was so easy.  My mom makes fudge with marshmallow fluff.  Mine never turns out right...i just dont have the gift. So this is MY fudge now.  Also, I used chocolate raspberry chips and omitted the cookies and it was amazing.

I am laughing now reading the reviews... I crushed the oreoes with a hammer so you can only imagine how gritty and grey the fudge turned out. I came back to the recipe wondering what the heck I had done wrong. The first review, DON"T crush the oreos to much. Wish I had read the reviews first. I am going to give this another shot :)

Soooo goooood! I made the recipe exactly acc. to instructions (except used nestle white chocolate chips instead of white chocolate bars). It was AWESOME! I followed a lot of the other reviews and broke/cut the cookies into 4-5 pieces over a plate. I poured 1/2 the fudge mixture into the pan, then c arefully picked up the whole chunks, placed them ontop and then spread the rest of the fudge over it - this avoided any dirty spots. and the cookies were well dispersed and evenly coated. I placed it in the fridge for about 2 hours to harden up a bit, cut it into small squares and stored it in the fridge till I served it! It was great!!!

This turned out great. Do NOT take anyone's advice to melt the white chocolate in a microwave as opposed to the stove. I smelled something burning and happened to look over and see the top completely black. Thankfully I was able to salvage the rest of it (the bottom also burned). Besides that though, everything went well. Make sure to coarsely chop up the oreos as well (I did mine into 4 pieces each). Throw away all the loose crumbs to prevent your fudge from looking gritty/chalky.

Everyone who ate this fudge had one of two comments:  "It tastes just like cookies and cream ice cream!" or "It tastes just like a Hershey's cookies and cream candy bar!"  No bad reviews yet!  I will add this to my collection of flavored fudge recipes!

Great, tastes just like a Hershey's Cookies & Creme bar (my favorite as a kid). A little softer than I was expecting, but very nice. I made a batch for my boyfriend's mother for Mother's Day, I'm sure it will be very well received!

Edit: made again today for coworkers. Mistakenly bought Double Stuff Oreos--oops! I had a very hard time breaking them without the icing oozing everywhere. I would avoid them in the future!

Gorgeous, gorgeous fudge.  I just love it...  I followed the recipe exactly, although I did use mini Oreo's (all I had to hand) and cut them into quarters, and discarded the crumbs as I was concerned that it would taste a little gritty.  I will certainly be making this again and again, so easy and sure to impress.

I wanted a different fudge recipe for a change.  So I decided to try this one and another one from allrecipes.  I used the 3 cups of white chocolate chips like a reviewer said. I also just broke the oreo cookies in half, and did not use the crumbes like another reviewer said.  I tell you this is my new favorite fudge, and it was a hit at Christmas.  Will keep this recipe for sure!!!!

This was quick and easy, but as my husband noted, it wasn't exceptional and it wasn't horrible. To be perfectly honest, I thought it was just plain gross. Since the only real ingredients (besides cookies) were white chocolate and sweetened condensed milk, that was all you could taste. This is also obviously not a true fudge, which I knew going into it and I didn't take away any points for, but it's worth noting. It was just too sweet and the flavor wasn't anything special. It needs more salt to offset the syrupy concentrated sugar in condensed milk. I will not be making this again and it will probably end up getting tossed.

This is delicious!  I broke my oreos with my hands instead of using a knife to keep the pieces large.  It was great!  I really reccomend trying it.

This had a great taste, but I did a few things according to other's suggestions that I wouldn't do again, thus only 4 stars.  I used white chocolate chips, and next time I'd definitely go with the baking squares so that my fudge comes out firmer.  As much as I love the chocolate cookies, I'd cut the amount into a little over half.  It was just too much.  Also, I'd break them into 6-8 pieces a piece, rather than 4-5 pieces.  Lastly, instead of mixing the cookies into the chocolate, I'd pour down a layer of fudge, sprinkle cookies on top, and pour the remaining fudge on.  This also took a long time to set.

This was really yummy and SO easy! I cut the oreos into quarters. Mmmmmmm. Next time I might cut back on the chocolate a little, it was a touch too much white chocolate flavour. Otherwise it was delicious!!!

Super Easy & VERY good!  I missed the "chill" part for 2 hours.  Left on counter, but had to put in refridgerator to get firm before cutting.  Excellent recipe, will definitely be making many more times to come!  Yes, definitely don't crush the oreos into coarse piece, I crushed by hand & it worked perfect.

Wow!  These were really really good.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and used oreos with the red cream filling.  It definitely works better to hand break the oreos into 4 pieces and discard the crumbs (I ate them - what can I say?) For those who did this and had a problem with the fudge turning orange the secret is to not stir too much.  Just barely get the oreos mixed in there.  There will be some bleed-thru, but it creates a nice marbled effect.  Refrigerate them in an airtight container, because they will get a bit melty if left sitting out.  They are even better the next day, if they last that long. Cut them into little squares because they are definitely very rich!  If you are looking for a low fat, healthy dessert look elsewhere because this ain't it, but oh! So Good and so easy!!  I'll be making these everytime I need to take a dessert somewhere

I've always stayed away from fudge recipes because they intimidated me. This recipe is so simple and so good. I followed it to a tee, and it came out perfect. I've never had much of a sweet-tooth, but this is really good. It has the smoothness of fudge, with the crunch of Oreo cookies. Five stars and highly recommended!

very easy to make, we like to make it during winter and just place outside on patio table to set. don't skimp on the oreos and white choco chips- otherwise will taste more "milky" then sweet.

This was super easy to make and tasted pretty good but I think next time I will cut out some of the cookies.  There were almost too many cookies in it.  I'm sure other's will disagree with me, but I like the melt-in-your-mouth fudge and this was more like a candy bar that had to be chewed completely before swallowing.  Great taste and great appearance!

I thought it was missing something.  Simply tastes like the ingredients...White chocolate and cookies.  I wouldn't consider it a fudge.  It is a very simple recipe to make when you need a sweet treat to take somewhere.

The store didn't have any white chocolate baking squares, so I used white chocolate chips. It worked out perfectly. This was the fastest fudge I have made. I will def make this tasty fudge again and again.

Delicious! I used fat free condensed milk and tried my best to only break the oreos in half but when stirring them in with the chocolate, it is inevitable that they will break up more causing a slightly grey color.

Something I have noticed is that Hershey's has vanilla chips.  I always replace the white chocolate with the vanilla chips.  This recipe works great in the microwave too!  Just don't microwave the cookies in it.  One of my absolute favorite fudge recipes.

This is my favorite fudge and it is simple to make. I melted the chocolate in the microwave.  I put it in for 30 seconds at a time and took it out to stir.  I continued until the chocolate was smooth and creamy.  Also, make sure to leave cut or break the cookies into large chunks to prevent the fudge from turning to a dingy gray color.  I make sure to pick up the cookie pieces from the cutting board instead of sliding them off the cutting board into the chocolate. This was I don’t get any crumbs in the fudge.

YUMMY! White chocolate is one of my favorites - I've made this recipe twice now - the first time I used a bakers white chocolate and didn't read the reviews that stated NOT to break of the cookies too small. I didn't much care for the taste of the white chocolate. The smaller cookie pieces caused the fudge to have a gritty texture. I made it again using Nestles white chocolate chips and broke each cookie into 5 pieces and didn't put in any small pieces - this time it was AWESOME!nVery creamy, yummy cookies and cream fudge! Thank You!

Okay first of all my fudge is the most disgusting grey color.  It does NOT look like the picture here.  The taste is very sweet.  I probably won't make again because of the color.  Who eats grey food??

Wow! This was so easy. I wanted to get the baking squares as suggested but after looking at the price in the store I just couldn't afford it. I ended up buying two bags of white choclate chips instead and it turned out great. Thanks!

Great simple fudge recipe! I followed other suggestions such as- 3cups white chocolate chips, discarding all extra cookie dust/crumbs, and using the holiday oreo which marbles it red/white. I gave it one less star because although it tasted fine, and looked fine, it really was just...fine. Not "GREAT" like a true 5 star deserves. I WILL make again to keep a variety, but it won't be my "underdog" fudge. :o) Happy Baking!*** UPDATE- I'll be eating crow till next Christmas! After sitting overnight and taking to the family, it got RAVE reviews, and didn't last long! Guess I should be a little more patient next time!

So very, very good and very moreish.  The colour did turn a bit brown instead of the cream colour I expected but it didn't matter.  The end result still tasted the same.  Will make again next year.

A tip for those that said thier white chocolate balled up and got thick or stiff, if that happens to you when making fudge, add some oil to the chocolate (before you add any cookies or vanallia extract). The oil helps thin out the chocolate, make sure to use oil though not milk otherwise your chocolate and fudge will just seperate and look chucky and not appetizing.

LOVE this recipe!!  I go overboard at Christmas with making cookies and candies, and this one has become a staple in my lineup.  It's a more unusual fudge that kids and adults love.  :)

This was great for the first day or two but then got hard.  We didn't care for it after that.  We liked the idea of this recipes, but certainly don't want to eat in a day or two.  I am going to keep looking for a better recipe.

I thought this could use some vanilla extract for richer flavor. Very good, but hard and a little bland. No complaints from the kids!

I made this the first and second time exactly as written and it was wonderful - i was constantly asked to make more.  The third time i substituted white chocolate chips (a bit cheaper in Canada than the blocks) and it was just as good...so started getting creative as others had.  Now i have used semi-sweet chips with Dulce de Leche sweetened condensed milk and toasted almonds on top, peanut butter chips and layered the fudge with marshmallows in between (like Confetti slice) and latest creation was equal amount of dark chocolate chips and semi-sweet mint chocolate chips with regular condensed milk - and it is AMAZING.  I have even used low fat condensed milk (accidently) - it turned out fine if a little softer than usual but just as good.  This is one of the most versatile and tasty recipes i have ever tried!!  I can't wait to try other flavors of chips and condensed milk...have a can of chocolate to add to the next creation.

Great and easy to make!  I made it gluten free by using Glutino's gluten free chocolate vanilla creme filled sandwich cookies.  I cut the cookies with a serated knife and that worked perfectly.  My supermarket was out of white chocolate baking squares, so I used 3 cups of hershey's white chocolate chips.  I will definitely make this again!

If you're not careful they can turn a rather unappetizing gray color.  When you break apart the cookies pick out the larger pieces and GENTLY stir them into the chocolate.  The small crumbs/cookie dust will turn the fudge gray.

I made this fudge last weekend and it was super quick! Overall, it was good, but I found it a little bit too sweet for my liking. Definitely though, it is something to reach for if you're craving that little something. If you are someone who likes super sweet treats, I would recommend this!

This was to die for!  Very easy.  Just wish I had read the reviews beforehand - I crushed the cookies in the food processor, and ended up with scary looking fudge.  (I actually froze it and will thaw it for Halloween, and call it "graveyard fudge.")  Made another batch, this time, crushing the cookies by hand.  Success!  Note that you can melt the chocolate in the microwave to save time (and dishes).  Thanks for the recipe!

WARNING WARNING WARNING!!!!!
This fudge is HIGHLY addictive, and it only less than 10 minutes to whip together. I made this on December 23rd and I can't leave it alone! It's consuming my every thought. I was laying in bed on Christmas morning and I wasn't thinking about the presents under the tree, I was thinking about getting up for a cup of coffee and a big ol' piece of this fudge! LOL. Destined to become a regular treat at my house (unfortunately for my thighs.)  :)

Beautiful fudge! Sweet and creamy.  Be very careful to avoid adding cookie crumbs, and very carefully fold the cookies into the white chcolate mixture.  If you are careful, you will have white fudge with large pretty cookie chunks.  I increased the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  Wonderful!

I use red creme Oreos during the Christmas season and it makes a lovely, bright holiday treat!

Awesome! Super simple, I added white chocolate chips instead of bars. I storage them in the food container rather then just placing them on the plate on the counter.

The texture is more like the candy bar, than fudge.  The recipe made two pans.  The one pan satisfied our craving and the other I sent to work with my husband.

Delicious! A little piece of this goes a long way as it is very sweet. I took the advice of others and used a butter knife to cut the oreos into 5-6 pieces and discarded the tiny crumbs.

This is one of the easiest recipes ever.  Anyone can make these.  I had a ton of great comments about these.  I included these in a gift bag for employees & clients.  I didn't want to tell anyone what the recipe was though.  It was much too simple.

I had made this around christmas time, planning to use it as part of a goodie basket for family, and forgot to review it! This was super, super easy to make but it wasn't good enough for me to add to anyones baskets. My mom makes delicious home made fudge, maybe I'm just used to the real stuff, but this just tasted like a softened version of the hersheys cookies n cream bars. I wouldn't call it fudge. Thanks anyways

It was ok. I would have added more Oreos. It really just tasted like white chocolate.=(

This is so unbelieveablly good! I threw it together in about 10 to 15 minutes! I used 2 bags of white chocolate chips. I broke the cookies by hand, broke them into fourths. It turned out perfect! I love the cookies n' cream candy bar by Hershey's and this tastes exactly like it!!

Quite easy. I used Trader Joe's peppermint candy sandwich cookies and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract. It's VERY good though quite sweet. Isn't that what fudge is about.....being sweet? ;)

Loved the taste and the appearance, but mine did not set up very well.  Don't know what I did wrong.  I'll still probably try again, though, because we love how they taste.

Oh my goodness I love this recipe! It turned out even better than I expected. I was skeptical because my previous attempts at fudge have been less than stellar, but this was awesome! I wanted to find a good recipe to use for Christmas gifts, so I tested this one out beforehand & brought the leftovers to work. My coworkers loved it! Now I plan on taking it to all my family gatherings over Christmas- it might just become one of my signature desserts :). I can't wait to try it with the mint Oreos- they are my favorite!

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Easy and oh so sweet - good for those, like me, that have a sweet tooth the size of the Grand Canyon! Followed the recipe exactly and chopped my cookies individually. It was a very attractive fudge to please all the senses.  I'll be making this one for Christmas for sure!

My husband and I thought it was too sweet, but all the kids loved it.  My daughter brought it with her while helping at the school play and it was gone in minutes with everyone saying it tasted just like the Cookie and Cream candy bars that they use to buy.  I live in Florida, so good thing it was eaten quickly because it melted if out of the fridge too long.

This is THE easiest recipe I have tried. My family loved it... a bit sweet but still yummy, so next time, i will add more salt, and more oreo. Every bite must have oreo, so next time, after i pour everything, i will add more oreo on top, like right beside each other... but this is definitely a keeper....

This recipe was so delicious! I tried it nonchalantly thinking it tasted like any other fudge, but after a holiday party, everyone was asking me for the recipe! The oreos added a little crunch, which made it even better. I did 2 bags of white chocolate morsels without measuring, and it actually still turned out well. Can't go wrong!

This recipe is so easy and really good - the first time I made it, I forgot the salt and it was good, but the second time I made sure to include the salt and it tasted much better.  It's a winner with the hubby and both of my college-age boys, and their friends!

This recipe was simple and very easy to make. I used mint Oreo cookies instead of regular Oreo cookies. It gave the fudge just a hint of mint which everyone enjoyed!! It was a big hit at the Fire Hall!! :)

This was easy to make and my family loved it. Just like the Hershey cookies and cream bar.

Just made fudge for the first time ever, and this recipe was awesome. It's really simple to follow, and provides a good base for making other variances too. 
The only downside is that chocolate squares where I shop only come in 4 oz containers, but that's ok because I can double it. I tweaked the recipe slightly to add one six oz package of bitter dark chocolate in addition to the rest of the ingredients. This helps to balance out the overbearing sweetness of white chocolate and the sweetened condensed milk. Even with the alteration, it is still a very rich fudge.

This recipe is so rich and so good.  There was one review that pointed out the outcome of over crushing the cookies.  I decided to use Oreo minis instead and forget the crushing.  Just as good as the first batch.  I could have sworn the first(and second) time I made this, the recipe called for vanilla extract.  I added everything here to my shopping list.  I don't normally bake, so I would have no use for vanilla extract.

An avid baker, I thought I'd give this one a try since it's just three ingredients and seemingly easy. It just was not to my liking at all. And I used good quality white chocolate, too. I usually make my cookies & cream fudge with sugar, butter, marshmallows, vanilla, etc. I will go back to making it that way from now on.

This was very yummy and very easy to make. The only thing was that it seemed to not keep as well as the other fudge I made. On the third day it was kinda drying out. I did use knock off oreos so maybe that was what was causing it?

This recipe needed a few changes. First, if you really like Cookies N Cream, I'd use more oreos. For my serving size, it called for a half of a cup of oreos. 3/4 of a cup is better. Second, make sure that if you are making a loot less than the original of 40, use a MUCH smaller pan. Used a little bit smaller and the fudge was almost flat. :/

The taste was great! only thing I didn't like was it turned out rock hard. I think next time I will use one and a half bags of chips instead of 3. I also tried the suggestion of adding strawberry jam and it was ok but nothing I'd remake. But I will certainly make the cookies and cream version again!

Ok, I don't know what went wrong, since I followed this recipe to a T, but it never set and was incredibly thin.  It tasted ok though, so I'm sure it would have been great if it had worked out correctly.  Disappointing!

This recipe saved my holiday!  My go-to candy recipe failed me, leaving me in search of a last minute recipe to make two dozen small gifts.  This recipe was simple, and really looks great when done.  It couldn't be easier.  Just line your pan with parchment paper, then you can easily pull it out and slice the fudge with a pizza wheel to get those nice cross-sections of the cookie. So many of them were eaten in the preparation we are lucky there were any left to gift.  This will be on our list of go-to candy recipes from now on.  Thanks Eagle Brand!

This is fantastic!  I used 3 cups of white chocolate chips instead of the baking squares and I broke the Oreos into 5-6 pieces using my hands.  I made four kinds of fudge today (this one, regular fudge, rocky road, and peanut butter) and this was by far my favorite.  I would recommend this to anyone.

I made these for my boyfriend, he's a huge fan of white chocolate. I'm not, so I didn't like these too much but I did think it was a really quick and easy recipe that made a good amount of fudge. We'll see how he feels about them.

Im not a fan of white chocolate, by my finace is, so I made this for him to take into work during the holidays.  I followed the recipe exactly, it was super easy and according to my fiance and all his co workers, super delicious.  He even caught one of his co workers stealing some and hiding it in his desk!  Ive made this several times since then, always for other people, and i get great feedback every time!

I've made this a few times and find them absolutely delicious. So has everyone else who have eaten it. Made it for a picnic last weekend and it got attacked. The host likened the people attacking it to vultures. I want to try this with double stuff or the double decker oreos sometime.

i made this today. it has been sitting in my fridge for about 8hrs and has not set up. the top is set, but the bottom is super super soft, not able to cut in squares. followed the recipe as written, no changes. the taste is good, but just not the consistency im looking for, and not able to give out as planned. looking for a different recipe.

yum! This is a very sweet fudge. Just what I was looking for. I take some crushed up oreos and put them on top of the fudge for a little prettiness and some extra cookie. Took these to work and everyone loved them. Have made them time and time again.

Easy & delicious.  I made this with white candy coating.  After a couple of days in the fridge, the texture is not the same, next time will probably use the white chocolate baking squares.  Either way, still yummy!

These were great! I definitely recommend breaking up the cookies by hand. Cut the squares pretty small too, I'd say 1''x1'' because it's so rich it's hard to eat more than that at one time. I brought this to work and my coworkers loved it! My boss even asked for the recipe=)

Pretty good!  GREAT if you are an earth science teacher and want to provide a fun snack... these are now known as "fossil fudge" to my friends, family, and students! :)

This was quite tasty.  I made a mint version for Christmas using mint Oreos with 1 t of peppermint extract added when I stirred in the cookies.  The mint Oreos made the fudge a festive green color.  Would make again.

i took someone elses advice and cut the cookies. i cupped my hands and picked up the bigger chunks to add to the chocolate.  after i poured the mixture into a square pan. i pinched and picked up the small crumbs that were left and sprinkled on top.  i have never been a fudge eater, but i am now!!!sooo yummy.

I used 18oz of white chocolate chips and it took a while for them to melt on low heat but its delicious. Yes it turns out sweet but look at the ingredients chocolate, sweetened condensed milk and cookies...

Love the idea of using white chocolate, but this is just overpoweringly sweet making it hard to actually taste anything other than sugar.  Super disappointed

I loved this recipe.  I brought this into work and it was gone within the hour.  I've had several people request the recipe already.  I used 3 cups of white chocolate chips and 1 tsp. vanilla and a half package of oreo's.  Will definitely be making this again

4 ingredients - so easy!  To make sure you don't burn or brown the chocolate, use a double boiler.  Chopping the cookies with a knife makes a prettier end product than crushing them with a blunt object.

Delish!! This was soo yummy!! Another great fudge recipe to add to my collection! My family has said I'm the official fudge maker of the family it was that good :) My only suggestion, I took another reviewers advice of using christmas oreos that had red creme instead of the normal white for a more festive look....I got more of a halloween effect turning the entire batch of fudge red! So I will no longer do this unless I'm using it for halloween cause it was quite gross looking....luckily it didn't bother us & we still ate it all up :) But I would't give it as a gift to someone looking like that! Use regular white creme filled oreos!

This did not turn out well for me.  I melted the chocolate, milk, salt on the stove top, but my white chocolate/sweetened condensed milk mixture did not melt well, it sort of balled up even on low the whole time then I forced my oreos to mix in.  If I were to make this again, I'd certainly spray my pan with non-stick spray in addition to lining with wax paper and I'd try melting the chocolate in the microwave.  My product, while tasty, was crumbly and disappointing for as expensive as real while chocolate was to buy in my store.  I would not make this again.

I made these using orange filled Halloween Oreos. I have no fault with the recipe except they very sweet. The directions were right on. I did do as suggested & chopped the cookies & used the crumbs left for my grandson to toss on his icecream. This kept the fudge with almost no specks of brown. Note: I used 1/2 a pkg. of an  18 oz. bag of Oreos

This was good. Definitely super easy. Although I would like to mix something else into it next time, because the flavor of the sweetened condensed milk was too prevalent for me.  Be sure to break the cookies up by hand so that your fudge does not turn a brownish color.  Mine looked great by doing this.

Very, very good and very, very easy! I tried to follow someones suggestion by putting a layer of cookies on the bottom of the pan and then spreading out the fudge on top and it didn't work for me...the fudge was too thick and didn't spread easily so I ended up mixing it all together and then spreading in a 9x13 pan. Will definitely make again!

Hands down, the BEST recipe for fudge EVER!  I have made this countless times over the years. Anytime I go over someone's house or to a party, this is the recipe I bring.  It is an absolute hit with everyone.  Everyone asks for the recipe and it's so incredibly easy.  I've got it practically memorized because I've made it so much.  I brought this to a Halloween party last year and used orange food coloring in the chocolate and it was a huge success!  Why make any other kind of fudge?  A MUST TRY!  Fabulous!  :-)

The only things I did different were that I used three cups of white chocolate chips and a 9x13 pan. These were REALLY simple and also really good (IF you like white chocolate...which I do).

I made these for my daughter and she loved it.  She likes oreos and white chocolate.  Tip:  be sure to only break the cookie in about 5-6 pieces for the best result and look.  Will make again and again.

Quick, easy, tastes heavenly.  I appreciated the lack of stirring forever like traditional fudge!!!!  This tastes just like an oreo cookie.  Mine did turn a little grey but it doesn't make it look less yummy. You only need about 1/2 package of oreos for the recipe so doubling will not cost a lot extra.  I also used white chocolate chips like another reviewer.  That was what was on sale at my grocery store.  Takes about 1 1/2 bags.

I have tried this recipe in the past and had trouble with it setting up.  This time I used 20 oz of vanilla flavored almond bark and worked out good.  To avoid the "grey" color - here's a trick.  Break cookies into pieces and put them into the bottom of your pan.  Then pour the fudge on top and then press more cookies into the top of the fudge.  This way there is no stirring and the fudge won't turn grey.

This recipe was very easy to follow and has a delicious result. I found that the best way to break up the cookies was to simply break them into 4 quarters and they were the perfect size.

It's chilling right now and it looks awesome!! It's not grey. :] I love how the ingrediants promise a delicious treat no matter what. I was really worried that I would break the Oreo's to fine, so I used my hands then went over with a knife. I used a whole row of them in an 18 oz. package. This might be my first time making fudge right!!! UPDATE: Oh my gosh, yes!! IT looks great. I'll try to put a photo up; a picture would of helped me so maybe it will help others. This is fantastic, will MAKE  AGAIN. My little brother ate the whole thing in less than three days. He loves fudge lol. Particulary this one.

Very good consistency. Very rich, but we love em. Will dip in milk chocolate next time and add some more cookies. They were also better on the next day imo. Best fudge i had so far and so easy to make.

Followed the recipe to a T and the Oreos floated to the top leaving what turned into ice cream on the bottom. I left it in for 2 days and it still never fully set. Kids loved the taste, but it was extremely messy.

Perfect recipe as is. SO good! As other reviewers said, make sure you do no over crush the cookies! Just do it slightly by hand, otherwise they will taste gritty and turn grey.

This recipe is super easy to make, and it doesn't require any exotic ingredients. 

If you don't like white chocolate you probably won't be a big fan. But, if you are like me and my kids and you enjoy white chocolate you will find it very yummy. 

It's very sweet, so tiny squares are the best. 

My kids LOVED it! I'll definitely make it again.  :)

So, recognizing this is my own fault, I read the 3 (6 ounce) packages wrong, and thought that meant 6 ounces in total. Didn't turn out so well. I will be trying again tomorrow after another trip to the store.....

This was an amazing fudge that was so easy to make! Had to take something to a church meeting and this was a huge hit! The only thing I changed was I used mint stuffed oreos! Completely recommend this a great chocolate minty taste that looks great with the green stuffing swirled into the white chocolate! Will be making this for more things!

Loved this recipe! I made it in a double boiler so it wouldn't burn, and as recommended by other reviews broke the cookies into small chunks by hand.  One pack of Oreos was just the right quantity. To make the fudge more festive I sprinkled crushed candy cane bits on top before letting it cool. The peppermint taste added a nice touch! Making them again for my family Xmas dinner tomorrow!

Very dissapointed that the author did not to mention to melt the butter beforehand to avoid the grainy texture. Read it in a review after making it, and it definitely is a must in making this fudge recipe. Otherwise good.

The first time, i followed the exact recipe and it didnt set, but still a delicious gooey mass. My second attempt included 2-2 1/2 cups of white chococalte chips and for soft, malleable consistency, i used 1 cup marshmallow fluff. i love this recipe because its super simple and after i made it on christmas all my co-workers were begging 4 the recipe and even want an encore batch for valentines. kudos on creator's originality!

This is an excellent, easy recipe..I just followed what the others said and broke the cookies into 4 or five pieces and made sure there wernt alot of crumbs. Theres an ice cream shop here who sells it and theirs is too sweet and has all of the gritty crumbs in it. This recipe is way better!! I will be making it often!

Attention Women who LOVE and CRAVE Chocolate...This is the recipe for you!  My whole family loved this 'fudge' and are already begging me to make it again! I did put a few of the Oreo Cookies in the food processer and only hand-crumbled about 5 cookies. Then, I dragged my knife through the fudge before putting it in the refridgerator to chill, made a pretty 'swirl' effect!

Exceptional fudge.  I used a chef's knife to cut the cookies into quarters.  The fudge was chewy but not too chewy, and soft but not too soft.  It was just right! Will make again!

Super easy and so many options.  I gave this as gifts for Christmas this year using mint oreos.  My husband brought some to work and it was gobbled up in minutes.

This tastes just like white fudge covered oreos. Most people were right use large chunks of cookies because they will break up more as you stir them in. That way you don't end up with grey fudge. Yummy

I'm not a huge white chocolate fan, but this is delicious and super easy to make. I'll look forward to experimenting with different kinds of cookie crumbs for new flavors - maybe some gingersnaps or nilla wafers?

Super tasty and easy fudge. It does get dried out after a few days in a cookie tin though. I doubled the recipe using three regular sized (12 oz.?) bags of white chips and it came out just perfect.

This is easy and great!! My family LOVED it. It is now requested at every family get together and everyone wanted my recipe!!! The only thing I changed was.... When I crushed my oreos, I had about 1/2 a cup left over so I sprinkled them on top. Gave it a great appearance!

These came our great.. I only changed the cookies.. Instead of using regular oreos I used the mint ones.. they ended up tasting like thin mints.. I also broke my cookies by hand , i found the bigger the better when breaking them.  They leave a great texture inside the fudge.. Ohh I used Nestles Premium white morsels and melted then using a water bath technique.. Definately will make again..

Very good and EASY!!  I used Holiday Oreos with red frosting in the middle and they are so pretty!  I'm going to put them in Holiday gift baskets.  And I'm excited to try the spring and Halloween oreos too.

I made this for a bake sale and it was a hit. I took the other review's advice and broke the Oreos into pieces rather than putting through a food processor. They taste really good and looked great.

These were just ok.  Do believe other reviewers when they say these are too sweet, because they ARE.  I tasted some right before putting the oreos in, and the fudge was NOT too sweet, but once the creamy center of the oreo goes in and gets mixed in with the fudge, it becomes almost unbearably sweet. I even tried adding some butter to make the sugary taste go away.   Maybe the key here is to add more salt, or not all of the sweetened condensed milk.  They have potential, but overall, not a great taste.

This was very very very sweet!!!! It lasted a long time because of that. I crumbled my cookies a lot more than it is pictured, though, and I added an 1/8 tsp. of vanilla instead of salt. Good result still!

Given that it's white chocolate and I really don't care for white chocolate (I also used white choc chips - had onhand,) these were good (I made them for teachers, not for myself.) I used the Halloween oreos for color, thinking (ha!) that the fudge would stay white and the orange/black of the oreo would stay intact - the cream of the cookie turned the fudge orange, so it wasn't really as pretty as the original intent, but - once cut - it looked a lot better. Definitely recommend serving chilled and cutting into tiny pieces, as this is crazy rich - my 11 year old indulged in one "regular size" piece and, though she loved it, afterwards said she probably should have had a smaller piece. I also roughly cut the cookie pieces as others suggested, and placed them in a collander over the sink to shake out the crumbs. Doesn't get any easier than this!

Super Easy and delicious! So quick to make too! This will be a great back up to have when I need something special fast. My husband LOVED it and even got jealous as I loaded up trays as christmas presents. I have to add, I made this as Christmas presents for my coworkers. My Boss loved it so much he asked for the recipe to give to his wife! 5 stars all the way!

This turned out very nicely. I did add 1/2 stick(1/3 cup) butter to the chocolate chips while melting. Great tasting!

Just finished cutting up the fudge!
This is the best, it tastes so good! Extremely easy and only cost about $7.00 for all the ingredients to make 2 1/2 pounds!! I used 1 1/2 Nestle bags of white chocolate chips and everyone in my family loves it.
It will be just perfect to add to my Christmas goodie trays. 

One note: crush the cookies into 6 pieces with your fingers so you wont end up with grey fudge.

Really excellent and easy to make.  It doesn't stay fresh for long, so make sure it all gets eaten the day it is made.  Which is fine, because it is a good excuse to keep munching more!!!

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and broke up the cookies by hand into 4 pieces for bigger chunks.  This recipe was so easy, and so delicious!

I have made this recipe for several years and have never had a bad batch of fudge yet. This is my youngest son's favorite and every year for his Christmas party at school, he insists on bringing this fudge for all his classmates. Last year his teacher loved it so much she asked him for the recipe.

Very yummy fudge, but very rich due since it is nearly pure white chocolate.

Very good, although the consistency was more like a melty white chocolate bar than fudge.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious! I broke the Oreos apart with my hands and then cut them up a little more with a knife, as someone else suggested. I left the crumbs on the cutting board and only put the cookie pieces into the fudge mix and it turned out fabulous. It is very sweet but so yummy!

Too sweet and I have an extreme sweet tooth.  I did not like these at all.  I agree with another, that if you crush the cookies too fine the fudge will be grey. So it didn't even look appealing.  Not to mention a waste of money as I don't usually have white chocolate, oreos or eagle brand on hand.  I took these to a party without trying them first. BIG mistake. No one ate them.
