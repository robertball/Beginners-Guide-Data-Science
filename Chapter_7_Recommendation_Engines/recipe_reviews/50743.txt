My husband said I should always make the salmon like this.  The salsa is very good on the salmon and would probably be good on chicken or pork, which I will try in the future for variety.  With the leftover salsa I found myself putting it on a ritz cracker as a snack.

The salsa could have benefitted from a little lime juice and snipped cilantro, but other than that, this was pretty good. Oh, I use the '10mins per inch thickness' for baking salmon, and it turned out perfectly. Thanks, Tawnea!

I didn't bake the salmon but prepared it in my stovetop smoker. The salsa was an excellent accompaniment!  Added a little cilantro.  Good recipe to use for grilled salmon.

AMAZING!!! this fruit salsa should be put on everything you make. incidentally - i put 1/4 cup of mango in the salsa, and only one garlic clove, and instead of 1/2 cup of pineapple juice, i just wrung out the pineapple over it. (i had hollowed it out for the most part by picking at it while i cooked)

Absolutely loved it!!! The salsa was so delicious- added extra jalapenos to one half and left the other half without because my brother can't stand spicy food.  I prefered the spicier version.  Definately will make again.

The salmon was definitely tasty and the baked limes added some aesthetic appeal.  I added mango to the salsa, as I had some laying around.  It was a nice addition.  And I used Thai chilis, because you can't get jalepenos where I live (in Taiwan).   

I do have to say that the cold salsa seemed a little out of place with the  fresh-from-the-oven salmon.  It was also quite pepper heavy, which would be a turn-off for people who are undecided about peppers.  I would also let the salsa sit in the fridge for an hour or two before serving, so the pepper essence can soak into the juice a bit more.  I'll most likely make it/a close version of it again. Yum.

A very fresh and healthy tasting dish. I've made this twice now and the first time i was a little nervous of using 2 jalapeños because my mom really can't do spicy food so I only used one and absolutely no spice or heat could be tasted. The second time i used both jalapeños and its was MUCH better. The heat really wasn't much but it was just enough to give the dish a little zing. Will definitely be making this again!

I made this with hamachi (firm white fish) and it was excellent.  I will try making the salsa with cilantro and lime next time.

I made the salsa with a different recipe for the salmon. Very good and tasty (I used canned pineapple tidbits - for convenience and that's what I had in my pantry).

The salmon itself had good flavor, and I liked the salsa for the most part, but the peppers bothered me for some reason. They seemed a bit too crunchy. I'm thinking when I do this again I'll add a little lime and let the salsa mix marinade overnight and hopefully get slightly more tender. Im thinking the flavors would be more complimentery with chicken. My dad would probably vote 6 stars if he could.

Didn't care for the salsa; the tomato doesn't blend well with peppers and pineapple.  the whole salsa doesn't have enough in common with the seasoning on the salmon.

This was great!  The only thing not so great was not something that could be controled.  We couldn't get any  jalapeno peppers due to the recall on them. We used another kind but the salsa was just crying out for them.  We didn't use as much rosemary and we served it with garlic coucous.  Wonderful!!!

The lemon salmon itself was boring, but the fruit salsa was very good!  I cut back pretty significantly on the jalapeno because my wife and I don't like spicy--we used 1/2 a pepper, and it was plenty spicy for us!

I loved this very fresh tasting recipe. Since I was serving this to my family I omitted the jalepeno peppers. When my 13 year old approved of it, I knew this was a keeper.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it was DELICIOUS! The salsa had just the right amount of "kick", and there was enough left over for snacking the next day. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I loved this, I used Troucons of Salmon because I found other Salmon very expensive.  It was extremely easy to do, I found I could do it in the 20 minutes it took to cook the fish.  To make it look nicer, I moulded to rice into circle blocks using a cooking ring, then I put the salsa on top pileing like a pyramid and placed the salmon next to it, with the slice of Lemon over the wider part of the salmon.  Everyone commented on how nice it looked and how tasty it was.  I thought the Salsa would of been better with more flavours, but the mix of peppers and pineapple made the flavour interesting and light.  I used Grapfruit Juice instead of Pineapple Juice.  It perfect served only just slightly hot on a hot day when you don't really want a hot and heavy meal.

Loved the salmon part of recipe (fresh rosemary and lemon) but didn't care for salsa.....the flavor of jalapeño is overwhelming and the overall salsa flavor is not bold enough  to mask the strong wild salmon taste.  Tomatoes weren't listed in initial ingredients so I substituted a can of rotel...ugh.

That salsa is YUMMY!! I followed recipe exactly.  Recipe did not say cover or not to cover salmon.  I chose to cover and I probably cooked to long, but was moist and tangy.

Super good.  Yes to adding avocado and mango.  I also used a can of chunk pineapple and the juice from there. 2 tomatoes, only 1/4 cup total of red/yellow pepper.  I substituted the jalapeno (didn't have any) with tabasco ... won't do that again.  Use jalapeno.  And, just before serving I took the salmon out and fried it in the frying pan, I like the edge a bit crispy.  Loved it!!!

Definitely a hit with the b/f. If reviewed alone, we would have given the fruit salsa a 5. It was awesome. MAKE SURE YOU BUY SALMON WITH NO BONES!

Salmon had a good taste out of the oven with the lemon, but I thought the salsa had a weird flavor.  Probably won't make again unless I get a better recipe for fruit salsa!

This was very tasty, although I would recommend covering and not cooking as long!  The salsa was great although kids didn't feel the same.  Cliantro and watermellon were added with less jalap. A nice change of pace for salmon!

I dont like fish usually, but this was good. Made but didnt eat the salsa.  I made 2 foil packets and added the lemon, rosemary, salt, pepper, and some Mrs Dash.  Forgot the water.  Cooked for 30 minutes at 350 and it was cooked perfect.

Made this for supper last night, and it got rave reviews.  The salsa adds a nice pop of flavor.  Very light and flavorful and is a definite keeper.
And to add to the easiness, I used canned pineapple instead of fresh and was able to use the juice from the can.

Very yummy- I didn't change a thing except used canned pineapple instead of fresh. The salmon w/o the salsa is great, too. (I still prefer it with it, though)

great for a light summer meal. I thought the salsa needed a little something so I added cilantro, salt and coriander. Cooked the salmon as directed, but also threw in a few chicken breasts for my husband and daughter since they don't eat salmon. Came out great.

This review is for the salsa only. I made the salsa with some grilled talaipa.  It was very good, but it was a bit too light and summery for March. I may try it again this summer. My husband thought it was good with the "hint of lime" Tostidos.

This was pretty good, my husband added some more seasonings to his (he likes lots of salt) and I left mine as is and enjoyed it with a salad.  Yummy.

Really good. Makes a lot of salsa so hoping to use the leftovers with grilled pork chops tomorrow night. I used a 14 oz can of pineapple tidbits with juice and yellow and orange peppers but otherwise made as directed.  Very nice meal tonight with a side caesar salad.  Will repeat this often.

I made this for dinner on Mother's Day, and my entire family loved it! I used fresh pineapple and mango, and used a little box of pineapple/mango juice. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added that mango and used only 3/4 of a jalapeno.  (I don't like spicy food very much and was nervous it would be too spicy.  I left some jalapeno on the side for my dad to add extra spice to his.) I baked it for 30 minutes uncovered, and then left it in the oven for a few extra minutes with the oven turned off.  I served it with farro and baked broccoli.  Yummy!

actually 5+  ... I made this for dinner Thursday night and it was sooooo good.  I ended up having unexpected company and they loved it too.  I mixed the salsa together let sit for a while, and at the end ended up throwing in an avacado and some cilrento.  Have added to my favorites and will make again.

Our whole family loved this recipe!  It is very hot with the jalapenos but we thought it was fantastic and the pineapple gave it just a little sweet with the spicy.  I really wanted to try some mango with it too but kept forgetting to buy it.  Already made twice and will be using this recipe often.

I used a 1/2 cup pineapple and a 1/2 cup mango. It really helped mellow out the jalepino, making the salsa "kid" friendly.

I wanted this recipe to be good, but the Fruit Salsa has WAY too much onion and garlic for me and my family.  I will probably make again and tweek the salsa recipe by using milder green onions, cutting way back on garlic and maybe adding some lime juice to perk up the flavors a bit.

I really liked the fruit salsa!  We ate this with rice, even mixed some of the fruit salsa in the rice....deliciously sweet with hint of hot spice (depends upon the jalapenos).

I used canned pineapple. I really liked it but my 9 year old didn’t really. She thought the garlic and peppers made it spicy. She prefers her salmon not to go with anything else, like a salsa. I liked the ease of baking it.

Excellent. Only thing I did was grill the salmon using  a cedar board and added about a 1/4 cup diced strawberries to the salsa. Make the salsa the day before it so much better that way.

The fish was very tender and good this way. There was way too much salsa and the fish would have been fine on its own. We did eat the salsa with eggs the following day.

Loved this with minimal changes!  1) I decreased garlic cloves to one 2) didnt use jalapeno so that my 4 year old could enjoy 3) added a diced mango.
