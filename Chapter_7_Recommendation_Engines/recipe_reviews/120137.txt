Delicious! Instead of the whole potato, I sliced it in half after it was done so it'd be easier to scoop the potato out.

Not your typical twice baked potato.  The egg really changes the consistency.  I was nervous after mixing up the pulp and other ingredients, because it seemed very  liquidy.  It set up really well after it was put back in the oven and the result was very good.

Good recipe.  Good flavor.  The cheese on top was very dry and over cooked.  I would add the cheese about 10-15mins before the potatoes are done, or for a creamier taste, top with melted velveeta cheese. Yummy!

These were great!  I deviated from the recipe by skipping the bacon (I got lazy).  I put the cheddar cheese in the mixture but skipped the amount designated to go on top.  I also put the onions in the potato mixture rather than on top, but did sprinkle them with green onion tops after baking, as a garnish.  I changed the process by cutting my potatoes crosswise (see my photo).  In order for them to sit up, I had to cut a small amount off the ends to make it a flat surface.  It didnâ€™t matter that once scooped my shells were open at both the top and bottom.  I filled my shells and they baked up just fine that way.   Just a tip: leave a decent amount of potato on the shell, otherwise they may break or split when filling or serving.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was great!   If I were REALLY dedicated, I would put the potato mix in a pastry bag and fill the potato shell using a fancy tip.  But not necessary, this recipe is excellent w/o the fancy/schmanzy fussing.  I had to wrap the potato shells w/ foil b/c I tore them when I was scooping them out.  I removed the foil at serving time.

My kids loved them.  When I made them I cut the potatoes lengthwise. Another person suggested garlic and I used garlic salt.  I also added the remainder cheese during the last 5 minutes of baking so the cheese would not dry out.  Next time I will try sharp cheddar.

Fabulous.  Even without bacon and onions this was delicious.  It was the first time I managed to get my kids to eat more than 1/2 a baked potatoe.  Thanks so much!

This was a very good recipe! I was suprised how pretty the potatos look I would of took a picture but we just could not wait to eat them lol. It did feel like it was missing a little something and i would have to say that butter taste so the next time I think I will add butter to this.

Very good recipe!  I think next time I might a little garlic to the potato when mashing them.  My husband loved them and he hates "cheese on everything", and the kids loved it too, although I never told them about the eggs and mayo!  

Will definitely make again..thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled it for a family of three (with a huge potatoe lover). We had one or two left over. I also cut them in half which makes it way easier to scoop out. I had to give five stars for how much husband and child loved this.

Great, easy and fun to make. So tasty. I did mix the green onions in the filling rather than placing them on top but I think it would be great either way!

These turned out awesome! Used 2 VERY large red potatoes let them cool for about an hour and that made it way easier to scoop out. Skipped topping it with the remaining cheese and used turkey bacon and chives instead. YUM YUM

Recipe as written is OK but I made it better: First rub potatoes in olive oil and salt and bake for ~40min. Then scoop out the insides, brush inside with butter/salt/pepper. Fill the inside with shredded cheese/bacon/ham then crack an egg on top. Add more salt/pepper/cheese then bake for ~20min. AWESOMMMEEE

I was not as thrilled with these as I thought I would be.  The kids absolutely loved them but I did not think they were fluffy enough or flavorful enough.  Maybe it was just me because the reviews are excellent and my family loved them.

wow i have never made such good potatoes. but that's probably because i'm still an amateur. 
so being an amateur, i couldn't scoop out the potato from its shell.. so i just mashed it all up and made it into mashed potatoes, and sprinkled the cheese on top.
i also added a slice of pepper jack to the mash to add a little more flavor
my roommates like to eat this dish with lots and lots of tapatio!

These were great! It seemed soupy when I mashed it together, but cooked just fine, and tasted great. I would cut the mayo in half next time. I don't love the flavor. I also used Hormel Real Bacon crumbles instead of cooking bacon, it saved time.

so easy! i ended up breaking a couple potatoes trying to scoop them out, so i'd recommend making a couple extra just in case.. i ended up throwing the broken bits into a glass pan and adding the potato mix into it, so it tasted great it just didn't look as pretty.

seriously though, this is the simplest twice baked potato ever. yummmy :)

pretty good recipe.  i cut the potato in half since it was easier to scoop out the potatoes.  I like a little more flavor, so I added some butter, garlic powder and onion powder.  I did not add the bacon, green onion and cheese toping until the last five minutes of baking.

I lightened this recipe a tad by subbing low fat mayo, fat free milk and fat free cheese (for those of you minding your waistlines). I also added a teaspoon or two of garlic powder, omitted the bacon and extra cheese. To get a smoother consistency, I blended the mixture with my immersion blender, rather than mashing it. The result was light and fluffy - the filling was overflowing from the shell!   My boyfriend and I devoured these bad boys along with a steak in balsamic & red wine reduction and a side of steamed broccoli.  Excellent, and not nearly as difficult as I thought they'd be!

Pretty good recipe, it definitely impresses people more than your average baked potato. The only problem was that it was too dry, and I couldn't figure a way around it.

I made these potatos for my husband and they came out great. We both loved them. I added more mayo than called for and added Garlic Garlic from Tastefully Simple with Hormel bacon bits. I only had red potatoes. The red potatoes came great but I'm sure russett potatoes would have been better since the red potato shells have a hard time keeping their shape. Easy to make but takes a long time to bake. I will definitely make these again because they are so yummy. Don't forget the sour cream when serving!

Pretty good. Creamy, but shells do fall apart before stuffing.  Recommend  encasing in tin  foil to preserve shape. Also, recommend dotting in butter on top, otherwise will dry out when cooking. But good, not the best though.

Recommended...tried these to go with the steaks I cooked for the Valentine's Day dinner I made for my wife.  I added some Parmesan cheese to the mix to give some extra flavor.  Also added a couple of dashes of Tony Chachere's seasoning for extra kick.  Overall we both enjoyed this recipe; will make again.
