Here's some tips:  I adjust it for 24 servings - it's an even 1/2 c. butter.  Keep heavy cream to 1/2 c. as well.  Only add sugar gradually until desired consistency - this will prevent grainy.  Don't like almond addition?  Skip it and add full teaspoon of vanilla.

Easy, yummy, and easy-to-make frosting. However, bit too much almond
flavor for my family. Next time I make it I will cut in half the amount of
almond extract.

I was unsure how to rate this. It tasted excellent, but looked grainy and ugly when done. I made this for cupcakes for my kids classes at school and had to take each cupcake and roll it in sugar crystal sprinkes because of how the frosting looked. Once I did that, they looked fine. However, having said that, it is probably one of the best tasting frostings I have ever had, and the cupcakes were a huge success.

The flavor was great; I omitted the almond extract because I didn't think it would work with my dessert. My only complaint is that the frosting didn't seem to hold up to warm temp, I had to refridgerate them so the frosting was very stiff when cold!

I have never reviewed any recipes before, but this one deserved my time and efforts.  This was the best frosting I have ever made. ever. It was creamy and had a nice consistency..not too heavy, not too light  Everyone loved the hint of almond flavor.  I did not experience the grainy texture that others had mentioned. I did make sure to follow the directions and alternately add and beat the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar.  Also, I cut this recipe in half and had PLENTY of frosting left.  I frosted a "lambie" shaped cake (which needed a lot of frosting to give it a wooly texture). Greatest frosting recipe ever. I highly recommend this recipe!

Tasted amazing and got rave reviews from my guests! While the frosting did look a little grainy it wasn't as bad as I thought it would have been with reading the other reviews. I made the recipe to a tee and would only make half next time ~ Since after 2 dozen cupcakes and a 9 x 13 cake I still had a good amount of icing left over.

I really love almond flavored sugar cookie frosting, so I added a little more almond extract.  I made half the recipe and it was plenty for four dozen sugar cookies.  It was a little runny for me, so I did have to add more powdered sugar.  I think next time I make this I won't add as much whipping cream to it, and it should be perfect!

Delicious but I used way less cream and flavored it with marshmallow LorAnn flavoring.  It tops a white chocolate whipped cream cake and it has blue white chocolate stars on it.  Yummy!

Very easy recipe (esp with AllRecipes ability to change the serving/ingredients).  Taste was good (my girls love sweet!) but texture was a bit grainy.  Great recipe if you are brand-new at making frosting and want to find out if it's do-able.  Now that I've done this I can try other recipes--and/or play with this.  If you need a simple frosting recipe that does not call for shortening, this is a good one to try.

I followed the instructions to a tee... And my frosting turned into sweet butter.  My daughter started over again and it was not butter this time it just did not turn out to anything except for watered down sugar.  I will try another recipe.

AMAZING!
Was so simple! I only made a third and it still made way too much for my 12 cupcakes. But very delicious! Quick and easy!

If you love the flavor of almond, this recipe is incredible!  It was my first time doing a cake icing from scratch and it came out perfect.  I used it on a pyramid shaped cake for a birthday and it stayed put and even had a bit of a "sandy" look to it which was great.

YUMMY frosting, but mine has the consistency of cookie frosting (it's super runny). I've kept it in the refrigerator for almost an hour and it's still not fluffy.

Just tried this recipe, cut it down for 24 servings. I LOVE it, I definitely agree with some of the other reviews, easy on the almond. The texture for me was not grainy at all.

Came out extremely sweet, and extremely grainy. Method is incorrect; sweet tasting but directions need to be corrected to create a better texture and appearance.

Followed the directions, except I only put in two cups of 10X and this unspreadable, drippy mess, was so sweet it almost hurt to swallow.

I will probably not make this one again. It wasn’t what I was looking for. I really wanted it to be creamy, it was more like paste. It tasted fine but not the the texture I was looking for. I should have listened to the other reviews.

Very yummy however it had a very unappealing visual consistency and melted very quickly at room temperature. Will not use this again without trying less butter and more sugar for a smoother consistency.

Flavour wise, this is really good, but it's not nice in appearance.  Thankfully this cake is for my family and they don't care what it looks like.  Will look for a different recipe next time.

Pretty good recipe. I omitted the almond extract and added chocolate chips, not bad.
