Is a very good and easy recipe. This is a tasty change for famililes on the run.  I added 1/4 c green onions and a little more cheese. The second time I made it, I also cooked 2 chicken breast and added them to the casserole.  My 5 yr old loves it and so does my honey.

This quickly became one of our family favorites. I usually add some tortilla chips in the casserole as well as on top. Thank you for sharing!

Very good and very easy.  I added a can of black beans, drained and rinsed, as another reviewer suggested and left off the corn chips as they go soggy on the leftovers.  A great vegetarian main dish.

I tried this recipe and found it incredibly bland.  It sounded like it would be tasty, but it really was not. Will not make it again.

I did not like this at all and my husband thought it was OK.  All I could taste was the chili powder, which was too strong.  None of the other ingredients seems to contribute to the taste.  It was kind of boring.  We won't make it again.

This came out a little 'dry' for my taste and it didn't seem to have a strong cheese taste, which I was looking for.  Maybe double the cheese soup?

Otherwise, it is a good base recipe, maybe it needs some tweaking to pump up the flavor?

Yums!! This was SO delicious. It's one of those recipes that is better than it sounds. My husband loved it too--he said it was one of the best meals I've ever made, which is always a nice compliment :) I will definitely be making this again! Thank you!
