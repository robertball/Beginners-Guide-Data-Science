I just had to review this because I couldn't believe no one else had. I'm going to be honest and say I eyeballed most of the ingredients and just added to taste but every single batch I've made has been downright superb!!! I agree nothing else tastes quite right and this one just hits the spot. It's become a staple in our household.

Really good. I added a little butter to this to give it a richer flavor. The whole family approved. Keeper!

Just what I was looking for. I had all the ingredients on hand & it was easy to make. I followed the recipe  exactly, didn't add crushed pineapple to the sauce    since it was optional. Even my pickiest eater liked it.

Great sauce, I did add ginger,  cut the white sugar in half and added brown sugar, used a third of ACV and replaced the rest with distilled, a  drop of lime juice used pineapple chunks, some cut up bell pepper and scallions, because I used this sauce for Sweet n Sour MeatBalls. It was Amazing;-)

Absolutely fantastic. I think my boyfriend raved about this recipe for a solid 30 min after eating it.   I mixed it in with chicken, onion, celery, hot and sweet peppers, more of the leftover pineapple, and served on rice, but I think this would delicious on anything you put it on.

A really good basic sweet and sour sauce.  I made it with half white sugar and half light brown because I ran out of regular sugar.    Came out wonderful.  Would be good with a bit of hot sauce if it's too sweet for you but I love it as is

Best sweet and sour sauce recipe I’ve ever made! I substituted 1 cup of corn syrup and a half cup of white sugar for the sugar in the recipe. Also used flour to thicken, but only because I was out of corn starch! The corn syrup gave it the shine the corn starch would have.

Delicious and easy to make. I used the cook's suggestion to use the pineapple chunks, for both the juice and the crushed pineapple. That made it a lot more economical.

I’m not exactly the best for measuring things, but even so, the combo of ingredients makes for a beautiful sauce. It is simmering to perfection right now and I am quite happy. The only real change I made was, instead of crushed pineapple, I bought real pineapple and have it a rough blend in water. Thanks!

Didn’t use garlic powder.  Very good recipe.  Reduced sugar a bit.  Was very good with our chicken balls.  Will certainly make again.

I substituted orange juice for pineapple and added some green pepper chunks as it was simmering. We all loved it and will definitely make it again!

I had never made sweet and sour chicken and wanted to try it. This recipe looked closest to what I was looking for. It was excellent! I may never order Chinese food out again. It was so easy to make. You can't go wrong with this. I had a problem with it thickening enough, so I just added more cornstarch and liquid. I didn't have quite enough pineapple, so I added a little orange juice. It was great.
