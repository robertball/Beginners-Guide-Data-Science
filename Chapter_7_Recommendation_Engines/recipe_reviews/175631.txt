Great dish!  I made it vegetarian by replacing the pork with tofu sliced in 1 inch strips and by not using the egg.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

this turned out really well. I made a few adjustments, using chow mein noodles in place of the pancakes, and only adding a little bit of hoisin sauce when I tossed the meat mix and noodles together. My only complaint is that it was a bit salty, so I may cut down on the soy sauce a bit.

I thought this recipe was great. I used rice spring roll wrappers and plum sauce. The wrappers and plum sauce are found at any Asian market or on Amazon, or other places online and very easy to find. I have to be gluten free so I make my own Amerasian food so I get a variety of all the good stuff, and this is good!

This was really tasty. However, another reviewer had suggested using spring roll wrappers as the pancakes which we tried and found they don't really work with a hot filling. We ended up just putting the mu shu on rice.

Well, here is another case where I didn't see the reviews and as it turns out, it didn't matter. The other  one I am referring to is one that had not so favorable reviews and I loved the dish....this one has pretty good ones and ended up something I wasn't impressed with. There is a bunch of steps, the egg provided an odd texture, and the mushrooms were chopped and MIGHT have given the dish some flavor but got lost in the dish to me. I could not find the Chinese pancakes and used the chow mein noodles as others suggested and that was fine but the sauce was like a thick tar that didn't distribute flavor to the overall dish but was confined to wherever you dabbed it on. The pork was mighty tender but that is the only thing that stood out to me. Sorry but I will not be making again.

I didn't care for this. Too many unnecessary steps.  If you've ever had real Moo Shu, this is not it. Skip it and look for a less complicated, yet more fulfilling recipe. Oh and you need real "Asian pancakes", not rice paper.

This makes a great, quick at home Asian dish that the family likes.  Changes:  I used pre-packaged slaw mix, leftover chicken or pork, any mushroom mostly for texture rather than flavor and flour wraps instead of pancakes.  Don't skip the green onions and add extra ginger. Definitely spread the hoisin all over the wraps, as this is what gives the dish its flavor.  If you like spice, add sriracha or cayenne powder.

I might try it again adding matchstick carrots and pea pods, as well as strips of bamboo shoots and celery, oyster mushrooms, bean sprouts, and water chestnuts.  It just needed more to it.  The sauce was OK but a bit thick.

Loved this recipe! The hoisin sauce is a must. Loved putting this dish together. Not sure how anyone could consider this meal plain.
