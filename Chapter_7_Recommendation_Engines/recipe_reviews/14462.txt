You know what I think?  You only live once, so why not use a whole darn avocado.  I also used 2 green onions instead of a regular onion.  And it was delicious.  Lots of flavour and colour.

Very pretty salad.  I made my beets heart shaped for valentine's day.  Was a bit confusing in instructions - step #4 "with the 1/2 cup vinaigrette"  There was more than 1/2 cup, so I wasn't sure if I was suppose to put the beets only in a 1/2 cup of the liquid.  I put the beets in it all.  thanks!

My guests loved this and so did I. Beautiful on the plate, and fun and easy to bake the beets. I did not use the second amount of vinegar though. It was enough with just the apple cider vinegar. I also used toasted almonds. Thanks!

Very yummy! I made the mistake of putting it on the same plate with mashed potatoes/main entree and the beets/dressing turned the potatoes pink. It was kinda funny -- so my suggestion is to make sure you keep this salad on a plate by itself! The taste was really good --- nice combo. of ingredients. Very pretty, too. I used canned beets, which were way less of a hassle and just as good. Thanks for sharing!

My husband raved and raved about the delicious new flavors in this salad. It was a nice compliment to our meal, and one I'm sure to make again. I couldn't find apple cider, so I had to use plain apple juice...it had a slightly different taste than I imagine the cider gives it and I can't wait to try it with the cider.

This was good. I've never cooked raw beets before and boy do they taste just like canned!! Next time I'd use canned and save all that time. I didnt toast the walnuts either and they were still good. My boyfriend really liked it. Im on the fence...It was good, but I wouldnt make it again. Ok, maybe to impress someone because it was all red and pretty.

Definitely "can" the beets.  Too much time and hassle, especially the pink fingers you get from working with the beets.

Very good!  I don't like beets nor avocados but this is a light, healthy, tasty salad.

I marinated the beets, apples, onions, and avocados all at the same time since the avocados were a bit green and it came out beautiful and delicious.

I cooked the beets on the pressure cooker, used balsamic and red wine vinegar, used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and everybody loved it.  Thanks

I loved this! I used fresh orange and red beets which added beautiful color. The dressing was fabulous-- it turned a bright red from soaking the beets in it. I made enough for 3 days and just stored the dressing and beets separately. It wasn't difficult to cook the beets at all. Great dish!

This recipe was a perfect Thanksgiving starter salad although it was more filling than I intended! I did make a few changes on the dressing. I boiled about a cup and a half of the cider until it had reduced to 3/4c to intensify the flavor. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I increased the vinegar to 3/4c. It was great.

I definitely modified the recipe to what I had on hand. I made the dressing out of red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, honey, oil, mustard, celery seed, salt and pepper.  I also didn't have any salad greens. I toasted up some sliced almonds and added some Boursin cheese. Turned out delish. I know it totally veered away from the recipe but the beet/apply/avocado/onion mixture was perfect!

This was really good but I thought something was missing.  I added some goat cheese and it did the trick.

I was initally very hesitant about this recipe, as I have had terrible luck with making vinaigrette dressings---but this recipe was delicious! My friends and I loved it---will definitely make again.

I LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe!  The mixture of the tastes was wonderful.  The only downside was that it took a long time to make, but it was worth it in the end.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  There was a lot of extra salad dressing, but I will probably just use it for other salads.

I halved the quantity of dressing and found there was plenty for 3 beets.  Marinated the sliced beets in all the vinaigrette and just ate the salad 2 days later so this definitely keeps.  Used powdered mustard in lieu of prepared mustard.  Forgot the onions on the salad, but I served this with sauteed chicken livers with garlic so I guess the garlic compensated for the onion, which I didn't even notice was missing until I just re-read the recipe!  Will definitely re-do, and definitely again with the chicken livers.  Delicious!

I made this salad 2 Rosh Hashanas in a row. I tweak the recipe a bit, adding pomegranate seeds on top as well as avocado slices. I set it up on each plate, which looks very impressive, but is also rather time consuming.

Great combination of flavors and textures! I used a Granny Smith apple, and the crisp tartness was a nice complement to the beets. My friend and I both agreed it needed a little something else, and decided some crumbled blue cheese would be perfect. I'll do that next time.

Alright, the vinaigrette is good, wasn't crazy about it.  The best part was the beets after they'd marinated in the vinaigrette.

If I could choose no stars I would.  
I am a huge fan of all the ingredients in this recipe, however, combined is TERRIBLE!  It looks pretty but tastes awful.  It takes wayyyyy to long to make.  This was a huge d disappointment, my boyfriend was not impressed either.

I thought this was delicious.  I added goat cheese which was a great complement to the sweetness of the beets and the apples. I also realized at the very last second that I used up all the apple cider and apple juice in the house... so I had to substitute 3/4 cup water with 1/2 tsp of sugar.  It was still delicious but I think it would be better with the cider.

Don't need to change a thing...FABULOUS!!!  Used olive oil in place of vegetable oil!!  Thanks so much for the healthy, beautiful recipe!
