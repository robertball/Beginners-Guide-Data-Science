I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this recipe so I followed the recipe exactly.  It was fantastic until I added the tomatoes. Then it was horrible. I'm not sure if it was the strong taste of the tomatoes or there was just too much going on in one pot. Tossed out and ordered pizza. I'm might make this again but will not add tomatoes.

AWESOME!!!!!!!
Sage lovers rejoice, I am not usually a stew fan but this dish was superb.  I substituted cream of brocolli soup for the cream of mushroom and added some florets.  Was delectable.

I honestly don't know why I first chose to make this because the recipe didn't appeal to me, but I made it anyway. I am so glad I did. It was delicious. I served it with a loaf of fresh French bread and everyone went back for seconds. Definitely a keeper!

This is a nice alternative to beef stew.  The reviews regarding the tomatoes made me a little nervous about using them. We really like tomatoes so, I drained the can of diced tomatoes and did not use the juice.  I felt like maybe the juice would overpower the chicken taste. We enjoyed it this way very much. The other thing I did different was to add another 1/2 - 1 Cup of chicken broth JUST BEFORE serving to get the "stew consistency" I wanted.  It was a little too thick without. Probably because, in part, due to not using the tomato juice.  I did not serve over rice, very yummy without.

It kind of reminds me of a name brand canned soup - only heartier and spicier.  I substituted an extra can of cream of chicken.  I also used oregano instead of sage.  It's wonderful served with cooked pasta shells.

My husband & I both liked this recipe. I opted to leave out the tomatoes, though, based on another review. I also made it in the slow cooker. Just "dumped" everything right in ( I left the breasts whole & shredded before serving) and cooked it on high for 4 hours, then turned it to low for 3 hours. Perfect! Chicken was tender and the broth was very tastey. Served in a "bowl" of rice with peas on the bottom. Nice alternative to traditional stew!!

Wow this was so good.  I left out the celery and added chives instead.  I sauted the chicken in butter and spices instead of oil.  I also used cream mushroom with roasted garlic instead of just plain cream of mushroom.  This was aesome!!! My husband absolutely loved it.  I will definately be making it again.  Perfect for Cold Winter nights.

I made the following changes to the recipe. I put all of the ingredients, except the chicken and diced tomatoes, in a slow cooker. I first browned the chicken in a frying pan, with a small amount of vegetable oil, and then added it to the slow cooker. I cooked the food in the slow cooker for 7 1/2 hours, and then added the tomatoes for the last half hour. As recommended, I served it over hot cooked rice.

This dish was easy to make due to its "on-hand" ingredients. However, I was hoping for better color, texture and overall flavor from this dish.

Very Good!! Made once and followed the recipe - would give it 4 stars that way. Made some adjustments and turned it into 5! Added a can of cream of celery, fresh mushrooms, corn and peas too!! Bumped the cup of chicken broth up to a can and omitted the tomatoes. Added some Italian seasonings and garlic and herb Mrs. Dash!! mmmmm....

This was better then I was expecting. I was a bit nervous about using the tomoatos after reading one of the reviews, but Im happy I put them in. I followed the recipe exactly & will do the same next time.

I loved this!  I added some potatoes after cooking the chicken and veggies in a can of chicken broth and skipped the tomatoes and served over rice with warm rolls.  It was wonderful!

Well, I would never waste expensive boneless breasts on a dish like this, so I used what I had leftover from a whole chicken I had roasted last week. The thought of using tomatoes did not appeal to me, so I left them out. Not a bad dish, but it needed more vegies and fortunately I had leftover gravy which helped with the overall flavor. Added more seasonings too and topped with dumplings. Good base recipe and thanks!

Wow!  Easy and delicious.  I made this for twelve people from age 12-70 and even the picky eaters loved it (even the one that picked out all the tomatoes!)  I added sliced mushrooms and wasn't exact on any measurements but the outcome was wonderful.  Definitely destined to become a family favorite.

Very good, if you drain the tomatoes, and add a little thyme.

I made it and kept it in the fridge for a day.  It was great the next day and even better four days later when I finished it off!

I listened to another reviewer and left out the tomatoes.  Added a can of white beans and some crumbled bacon instead.  Delicious!

Had this tonight. I love the seasonings in this soup. I changed based on diet restrictions, so no cream soups. I love that the veg can change in this too. I used carrot, onion, celery, and baby sweet peppers that needed to be used. The recipe didn't specify, but I did not drain my tomatoes. I started this with frozen chicken breast that I threw in when I added liquid and let them cook in the broth before dicing. I needed a cup more liquid but as I upped the veg amounts that isn't the fault of the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious. Made almost as instructed...I drained & rinsed my canned tomatoes. Served with egg noodles.
