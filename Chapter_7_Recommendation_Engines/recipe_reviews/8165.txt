My wife made this cake for us after we got a ton of persimmons in our market box. It is moist and delicious -- awesome!

This recipe works perfectly, and tastes fabulous. I added a cream cheese icing, which gave it a great added flavor.

Didn't try it as written, so the amount of stars applies to how it came out- in this case, I changed a lot. Used whole wheat pastry flour, 1 & 1/2 c persimmon pulp, left out spices & nuts, added an egg & 1 1/2 c very fresh chopped medjool dates. I wanted a very sweet breakfast cake for coffee, & I got one :). I think it would be very good with walnuts also, but wanted my baby to be able to eat some- I'll try it next time.

I made this tonight and it was a big hit. Makes a lovely, spicey sweet cake which is a perfect treat around the holidays. 

I made a few modifications. First - I doubled the amount of persimmons and used a little more butter (closer to 3/4 of a cup). So it made my cake turn out very moist but still light. I also added raisins instead of the nuts, which added to the sweetness. Will definitely make it again, and want to try it in muffin format.

Made this with a few changes! I read some of the other comments. For starters, I cut down on the spices. I used 3/4 teas of cinnamon and 1/2 teas of ginger. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Instead of all white sugar, I used half brown sugar and half white. Turned out fabulous!

You can't taste the persimmons, but this cake is yummy!  It was a great way to use up all those persimmons getting ripe on me.  I followed the recipe as close as I could, except I left out the lemon zest.  Try it with some whipping cream!

This was delish. The spice mixture was spot on and the aroma was wonderful.

It tastes pretty good, but not that much like persimmon.  I'll try tweaking it a bit  next time to see if I can't get more of a persimmon flavor.  Overall, it's a good way to get rid of a fair amount of ripe persimmons.

Yummy!  Somewhat dense cake but great flavor - loved the pecans in it.  Glad to have another tasty recipe for persimmons!  Will definitely make this one again - tonight!

I liked the taste of this after I made it but the cook time is way too long in my opinion, either that or the bread/cake mix might be better if put into a rectangle bread pan instead of wide cake pan. I put the cake in for 40 minutes and now it is too dry, maybe 35 would be better?

This was a great recipie to use up a bunch of ripe persimmons. I used the sites recipie adjuster to increase the servings until it used up as much pulp as I had. Then I put it in a 9 x 13 pan. It still only needed about 35-40 min to cook at 350. The only other adjustment I made was to use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I was surprised to have to add the baking soda to the pulp instead of the dry ingredients and even more surprised when it caused the pulp to gel. As described it made a very dense batter that I had to spread out in the pan and even after it cooked I could still see the lines in the top of the cake from the spatula, so it didn't smooth out much as it cooked. It has a dense cake texture and a nice flavor of spices and orange with only a light persimmon flavor even when using overripe persimmons. Mine also has small bits of persimmon since I didn't blend the pulp only mashed it.

Absolutely fabulous! Moist and rich with just the right amount of sweetness. I substituted three quarters of the sugar with Sucanat, (the other 1/4 with organic sugar) and the butter with coconut oil. It came out wonderfully! It is truly irresistible!

A keeper! Came out lovely - was a big hit at a potluck party, where there were a lot of desserts. Good combination of flavors. Only addition was 1 egg, since the ingredients were so stiff, it was hard to mix it on low with an electric mixer.  It was done in 40 minutes. One of my friends mentioned that she doubles the amount of persimmons in breads and cakes, which I will try next time. I also used a bundt pan, which I prefer for presentations.

amazingly moist, flavorful and very versatile.  I've made this many times now, both following the recipe and customizing it.  Everytime it's been wonderful.  The original is very good as is the gingerbread style version suggested by another reviewer.  And since it has no eggs, I can make it for my vegan friends.
