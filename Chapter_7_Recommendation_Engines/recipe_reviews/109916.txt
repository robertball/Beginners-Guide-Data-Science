I'm torn with how to rate this recipe. For the record, I made this exactly as written leaving out the optional mushrooms. While the flavor is good, there isn't anything "sauce" about this recipe and you sure couldn't eat it as a soup like the recipe submitter mentions. Was there a blending step that was left out perhaps? As written you will end up with a warm pico de gallo which is fine but don't count on a sauce.
