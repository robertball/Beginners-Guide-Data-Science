I would actually give this a 4.75, only because I found the lasagna to be very watery. Next time I would cut down on the broth. Great tasting, though, and leftovers just as good or better. I used homemade veg broth, which I do for everything. Very easy to make -- just keep all the ends of veggies that you have in a bag in the freezer (carrot ends, broccoli stalks, onion bits, etc). When you have enough to fill a pot, cover them with water and boil until the veggies have basically nothing left! Drain and keep the "broth." You can compost or throw out the soggy veggies, and then freeze the broth for when you need it. Great way to recycle old bits of veggies, and couldn't be healthier or more natural!

This recipe was wonderful!  Some changes I made include: fresh basil instead of rosemary, fresh spinach instead of frozen, and alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I also added chopped portobella mushrooms and a ricotta layer made up of ricotta cheese, 1 egg, mozzarella cheese, fresh parsley, and salt and pepper.  I used no-cook noodles to counteract the amount of liquid that the other reviewers talked about.  This came out AWESOME!  Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again.  So creamy and delicious!

I have made this recipe now several times, and it always comes out perfect.  Even people who hate spinach love this recipe.  I have found that no matter what type of noodles you use, you don't have to boil them with this recipe.

Excellent.  I sauteed the onion & garlic in a little olive oil instead of Pam for more flavor and didn't bother to spray the baking pan.  With the sauce in the bottom of the pan, the lasagna didn't stick.  I substituted a little oregano for the rosemary (I guess you could substitute a little basil too), used whole wheat lasagna noodles and, per one reviewer's recommendation, used a jar of (Classico) portobello mushroom sauce.  Instead of the frozen spinach, I substituted a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach which I just washed, drained, & chopped into slightly smaller pieces.  Although I did chop the artichokes a bit, I'd chop them a little smaller next time.  Just a note - this lasagna isn't high (like you'd think of for a meat lasagna).  If you'd like it higher, you could probably double the recipe, except for maybe the feta that you sprinkle on top.

I made this for an ultra-picky friend once, and need to make it again soon. It's a GREAT variation on the typical meat lasagna. My only changes were to use a home-made sauce, and I never boil my noodles first. I always use regular, dry noodles, and just make sure I've included enough sauce to boil the noodles as the lasagna cooks. The result is a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well, without mushy noodles.

This was so good. I used no boil lasagna noodles and left the artichokes whole and added the juice as well. I also used one bag of fresh prewashed spinach instead of frozen.And I added some ricotta when I layered. I've made it several times, it's a keeper.

WOW!! David..please tell me you have more than just this one recipe to share with us.  This was an amazing Lasagna.  The flavors blend together so well.  I only used about 1/2 a cup of broth (I like mine a little on the thick side) and crushed about 1/2 a tsp of dried rosemary since I didn't have the fresh.  I added 1/4 a cup of whipping cream to the sauce..to give it a pink look. This is truly a gourmet dish.  You could even omit the broth and noodles all together and use this as a dip with french bread.  I plan on passing this one along...thanks for sharing!!

Loved this unique lasagna and it was even better the next day!  Used no-cook noodles, fresh spinach, a 32 oz jar of sauce (which it really needed) & regular artichoke hearts instead of marinated.  The only thing I would probably do differently next time is to use less rosemary since 1 Tb. was a bit overpowering.

This was fabulous!  I couldn't find vegatable broth so I used chicken broth.  I also used a 16 oz jar of sun dried tomatoe alfredo sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.  After the jar was emptied I filled it up with about 3/4 c of water, shook it and added it to the rest of the mixture.  I also drained the artichoke hearts juice into the mixture.  This was a BIG hit at my dinner party.

I have been making this lasanga for years, it was a recipe from a Betty crocker cookbook. My version uses garlic Alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. You have to try it this way!  The Alfredo goes perfectly with the spinach and artichokes. Also, you don't need to cook the noodles first. They will cook when you bake the lasanga. This is a really great recipe that everyone I have made it for loves!

This recipe is fantastic!  For those reviewers that complained about it being too watery at the end, an easy fix is to just not cook the noodles at all.  Put the lasagna noodles in dry and they will soak up the liquid as they cook.  I wouldn't change a thing in here.  Do yourself a favor and make this as written the first time before you try any modifications, it's really good!

I love artichokes. I love spinach. I love lasagna. So I thought I'd love this recipe, but I didn't. It came out the perfect consistency, not watery like some reviewers, it was just very bland. I had even added extra spices. It seems like some of the reviewers that really liked it added a major ingredient, like ricotta or chicken. Won't be making again. **UPDATE** There was most of the pan left over, because nobody really liked it, and I will say that the leftovers reheated actually taste much better than the first day--even enough to maybe call it 4 stars.

Impressed!  One reviewer commented on how skimpy it was so I kept everything the same except decreased the noodle amount to 6 and put it into an 8x8 dish.  I used only 8oz homemade veggie stock, I used non-marinated artichoke hearts, added chopped fresh basil, dried rosemary, and thyme to the mixture, 7oz of fresh spinach, and regular feta (added a little basil, oregano, garlic powder to it).  It was wonderful!  My 2.5 year old had 4 servings at dinner then the next day for lunch had 2 servings.  I think this will become our regular lasagna dish from here on out.  Others suggested alfredo sauce instead, it doesn't need it!  Just think of all the extra calories you save by using a tomato based sauce!

This lasagna was great!!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the broth down to 8oz.  I also added some oregano b/c i love the flavor and used fresh spinach.  When i simmered the onion/garlic/artichoke/spinach mix w/ the broth, i left the lid off the pan to burn off some of the liquid.  I used one 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and then added one can (15 oz) of tomato sauce.  I also did NOT pre-cook the noodles - they turned out perfect.  There is plenty of liquid to boil the noodles as the lasagna cooks.  I also did not find that there was too much liquid (maybe b/c i reduced the broth).  My husband is already asking me to make this lasagna again.

A girlfriend and I made this for New Year's Eve for our husbands as a special dinner.  We added shredded chicken and a little alfredo to make it "pink".  It was heavenly.  I never eat my own leftovers, and this one I couldn't wait for.  The spinach is wonderful fresh, and the marinated artichokes are much better than the canned ones.  Make sure you have a deep dish, though, as it does grow in the oven.

I just made this for my "nerd club" aka book club and everyone RAVED about it.  It had to be hands down one of the best lasagna's I have ever made, meat or no meat.  It came out picture perfect and tasted even better!
I did follow the other's suggestions:
1. I used no bake lasagna noodles
2. 1/2 the amount of vegetable broth
3. Cooked fresh spinach
3. 1/2 cup half and half to sauce
4. Ricotta layer above the noodles and before the mozzarella.  I used about 16 oz ricotta, 1 egg, mozzarella, parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

This will be a keeper and is definitely going into the permanent recipe box....WE LOVED IT!  Thanks for sharing!!

With a few changes, this was a fantastic recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and opted out of boiling the noodles in favor of soaking them in hot water until I was ready to bake--they came out perfectly al dente. I also added a layer of ricotta mixed with parsley and mozzarella, which was a great touch. I'm only giving this four stars because it definitely needed some tweaking: in the future, I'll add slightly less vegetable broth, and whatever you do LEAVE OUT THE ROSEMARY. It overpowered all of the other flavors in the dish and nearly ruined it. I'll use basil next time. Other than that, this was a great dish and a great "quick" lasagna recipe, especially with the herb and garlic feta on top! I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe is really spectacular-- tangy and bursting with flavor.   Guaranteed to be a hit, with requests for the recipe.  *Like others, I find this dish a bit watery, so I reduce the vegetable broth by almost 1/2 and I do not boil the noodles.  This results in a firm lasagna, which is my preference.      I make a few other changes.  *I add a cheese layer of ricotta, one egg, and minced fresh parsley.  *I make the tomato sauce with Allrecipe's Best Marina Sauce Ever, and I truly think that this makes a massive difference.  That sauce is exceptional, super easy, and probably costs  bit less than many jarred sauces.  *I use 5- 6 oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  *In addition to the fresh rosemary, I add 10- 15 fresh basil leaves, and about 1T of a mix of fresh oregano, thyme, and sage.  *My prep time is closer to 45 min than 20-- and totally worth it.  *I find that this serves 8 adults with average appetites, when served with a salad and bread.    Expect this to serve only 6 hungry adults, or 4- 5 teenager boys.

I know everyone hates it when you adapt a recipe and rate it, but I made the alfredo version, and it rocked.  Added also 1 heaping tsp on sundried tomato 'pesto' to it, more black pepper, more garlic, and yum.  Also added that ricotta layer.  So delicious.  Not low-fat, but good for a nice treat once in awhile, and at least no bad fats (I made my own alfredo - not from a jar or can). Also, I indulge in pasta so infrequently, I always put a doulbe layer of the uncooked noodles.  Came out perfect, and beyond restaurant quality.

Very tasty.  The only changes I made were 1:not to cook the noodles ahead of time (should have, at least to where they started getting soft, because they were slightly firmer than I like)  2:used water and beef bullion in place of vegetable broth, tasted fine.  3: used 2 standard jars of alfredo sauce (a bit more than 28oz, but the extra moisture was good for the uncooked noodles).  

This was a great recipe that I will make again.  Leftovers were gone in 1 day (and were better than the original)

I followed the directions and suggestions of most: add some ricotta on the layers, sub basil for rosemary, don't pre-cook the noodles, and added some extra mozzarella.

It just didn't turn out well at all.  There was so little "sauce" that the noodles remained pretty al dente and it was really dry.  There wasn't enough sauce to fully cover each layer of noodles.  I don't know what I did wrong but I won't be making this again.

If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would! This is the BEST lasagna I have ever tasted and I love how you don't even miss the meat. VERY satisfying and delicious. The only change I made was using fresh spinach rather than frozen. I could eat this every day and never tire of it. Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Instead of mixing the artichoke/spinach mixture with red sauce, I mixed it with jarred alfredo and added shredded rotisserie chicken.  Then, I added a red sauce in between layers with the mozzarella.  GREAT!  I will definitely make this again and again, especially for guests.

Excellent! Instead of a jar of spaghetti sauce I roasted a pan of roma tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and garlic. I also saved all the juices from the tomatoes. I also had fresh baby spinach that I used in place of the frozen spinach. Since my family doesn't like feta cheese I opted for parmesan reggiano cheese. Also, I did not boil my lasagna noodles. I layered the uncooked noodles in between the artichoke mixture, liquid and cheese. I was careful when adding the liquid so as not to end up with too much liquid. The baking time is approximate for the lasagna. I can see the cheese bubbling as well as the liquid in the bottom of the pan. The liquid/broth cooked all of the lasagna noodles and did not stick when lifting it out of the pan. There are fresh flavors in each bite. It is hearty and delicious. The tomatoes, spinach and artichoke all works well in this dish. What I like best is that there is no meat, just fresh vegetables, tomatoes and herbs. I ate this with, "Michael's Foccacia Bread," also from this website.

My favorite lasagna! I've made it over a dozen times and now make the following adjustments. 1) Don't boil the noodles first. 2) Use 12 oz cooked fresh spinach vs frozen. 3) Use 3/4 onion chopped finely. Thanks for a great recipe, I can't eat meat lasagnas now, this is sooo good!

Amazing!  I'm trying to convert our diet to less meat and am looking for some vegetarian main course recipes that are filling, yummy, and balanced. This one is at the top of my list!

I presoaked no-boil noodles in hot water for ten minutes while preparing the filling. Followed the recipe for the veggie filling, using two bags of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I used fresh rosemary and added 2 Tbs of fresh basil.  For the cheese, I used the more traditional lasagna filling which is ricotta, mozzarella, and one egg mixed together. Newman's Marinara sauce is perfect in this recipe and brought the flavors all together.  Everyone loved this dinner!

Used less broth as suggested by other reviews. Did not boil the noodles at all which scared me but it was amazing! Not too soggy at all. A big hit!

I thought this was really yummy and easy to make.  I used the no boil noodles, I just soaked them in hot water for about 10 min to get them soft.

I love this recipe - I used it at a Crab feed we had at church as the Vegetarian/alternative entree, and it was raved over. I madde it with the tomato based sauce, but also made a pan with an Alfredo sauce from a jar. The white lasagna was probably the most popular of the two. I also added some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce another time, and they were a great addition.

Sooo good.  Made last weekend and making again this weekend.  Whole family loved, only complaint...no leftovers!  Used a bag of fresh spinach in place of frozen and as another reviewer suggested added a layer of ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg and mozzarella).  Replaced rosemary with italian seasonings due to personal preference.  Did not boil the noodles and had no problem being runny.

My husband really liked this. I didn't pre cook the noodles and it turned out great...it was a tad bit on the watery side though.

Love, love, love, love this recipe!!! So tasty and yummy!! I left out the rosemary, as I didn't have any, used fresh spinach, and only used 1/2 cup of vegetable broth. Also, did NOT boil the noodles and they cooked PERFECTLY!!!! I used a 9x9 pan and it filled to the top beautifully (but beware, put it on a cookie sheet in the oven because it can bubble over the side). My boyfriend was very skeptical, since it had no meat in it, but he loved it too (and has already asked me to make it again)! I am slowly cutting meat out of my diet, and a recipe like this makes it much easier. This is very filling and honestly you don't even miss the meat because it is so tasty.

Love This!! Entire family of picky meat eaters with different tastes all liked this. Prep is fairly easy, make sure to use-no boil noodles and it doesnt turn out liquidy. I have made this As Is and w/mushrooms, I also personally like to add a cup or two more mozzarella. Have taken to potlucks with great reviews.  It's a beautiful refreshing lasagna.

I made this dish for a party last night.  We had 10 people over, and my oven died right as I put in the lasagna.  We ended up microwaving it, and it still turned out great! 20 minutes on Medium, then 10 minutes on Med-High. We covered it with a damp towel so the noodles wouldn't get dried out.  I made homemade sauce the night before with olives and mushrooms.  It matched very well with the spinach and artichoke. I wish I'd made more,  I want some leftovers!

This is an excellent dish.  A group of about 8 of us get together every week for dinner, one girl is vegetarian, and I'm always looking for vegetarian dishes that won't leave the others feeling cheated. EVERYONE of us loved this recipe, and I have been begged to make it again several times now! Thanks!

WOW! What can I say?! This was a hit at our house! My husband said this was better than his mother's meat lasagna -- and she's pretty famous for her lasagna! This is one we'll make again and again. Like other reviewers suggested, I used the alfredo sauce instead of red sauce -- it just seemed like alfredo sauce was a better complement to artichokes and spinach. We gobbled this is up! Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This was a great option for vegetarian lasagna!  I have never had the artichoke and feta additions to one before and it turned out very flavorful!  Will definitely make this again.

I used chicken broth, a package of baby spinach cut up, quartered artichoke hearts drained and chopped. I did not cook my noodles and it was not overly soggy. Next time I'll add in ricotta to make it more lasagna-like. It was very good. I omitted the rosemary and used basil instead. We enjoyed this.

Made this for a vegetarian friend who just had a baby and ate some of the leftovers, and...oh my!!! Made a few changes based on other reviews: doubled recipe for 13X9 size, used no boil noodles and 20 oz fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I cooked the artichoke mixture for about 30 min before adding the spinach (and just allowed spinach to wilt) and then drained this mixture before adding a jar of tomato alfredo sauce instead of red sauce. I also reduced the amt of onions and garlic and topped with mozz and parmesan instead of feta. This was super creamy, cheesy and good!  I'm sure original recipe would've been a 4.5, but this took it over the top!!!

Delicious. I used a mixture of parm, swiss and mozzarella cheeses. Used jarred Rao's sauce since I didn't have any homemade ready. Used fresh basil and rosemary. This is really a delicious lasagna. I, like many others, didn't bother to boil the noodles. They cooked perfectly in the lasagna as it baked. Don't hesitate to make this recipe! Thanks, dmccracken!

Wonderful flavor. I've never used fresh rosemary, just half the amount of dried. 

The lasagna is a bit too cheesy and soggy. Next time I'm going to use 2.5 cups mozerella (maybe even less), and only 3/4 the can of veg broth. And to brown better I'll cover for 35 min and uncover for 20.

This was my first time making lasagna and everyone that ate it love it! I followed other people's suggestions and did not cook my noodles before putting it in the over. I mixed some ricotta with the mozzarella when making my layers. And unlike some reviewers I didn't think it was too watery. If you let it sit for about 15 minutes, it will absorb any excess liquid.

I adore this recipe. It's my all-time favorite lasagna. I will say that it comes out very watery, so I would cut the broth down to just one cup. But I've made it as lasagna and as baked rigatoni, and it's always delicious. I've done different things as far as topping - feta, no feta, goat cheese - it's all fantastic.

Super tasty - the flavors burst out of this lasagna and it was very, very simple to make.  I added shredded chicken (which I had boiled down from two breasts). Everyone enjoyed it, even the toddlers.  I'm not sure how/why everyone else's ended up watery.  Just make sure to really squeeze the spinach - the lasagna was saucy but NOT watery at all.

HELLO! This was amazing!!! I made it exactly as specified, and I wouldn't change a thing! This recipe will be a keeper in my recipe box. AS a vegetarian, I was pleased as punch (spiked!) to find such a delicious and KILLER RECIPE. The feta on top really makes it by adding a nice tangy zing. Absolutely delicious!!! Thank you so much for such a delicious meal!!! YUM YUM YUM!!!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, but I think it would be too watery if made exactly as the recipe states. It was definitely a 5 star recipe with my additions/changes :-). I took the advice of others who reviewed the recipe and used no-boil lasagna noodles (they soak up a lot of liquid) and fresh spinach. I omitted the rosemary and added some Italian seasoning to the vegetable/sauce mix. I also added some white wine while I sautéed the onions and garlic. I make my own feta cheese and I had a lot of it, so I put feta in every layer with the mozzarella. This lasagna was seriously good and full of flavor. My husband was unsure because it didn't have any meat in it, but after eating he said it was so good that he didn't miss having any meat. He is also not a fan of ricotta, so I was looking for a recipe that didn't include ricotta. This lasagna wasn't as high as the ones I typically make, and I would consider adding another layer or two in the future. This is definitely my new go-to lasagna recipe!

Very good.  I didn't have any veg broth, so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  I also added a full brick of cream cheese to the sauce and stirred until melted.  Adds a creamy quality to the sauce.  Really good.

Wow. I loved this recipe. I too decided to use "over ready" noodles as it tends to cook the noodle to the perfectly al dente. There is a lot of room to experiment with this and add additional veg (zuchini, mushroom, etc). I also added crumbed herb tofu to the mixture for extra protein and cheesey texture. Makes 8 generous servings and freezes well.

It was good, but a little soupy.  I think the veggie mixture needs a little longer simmer.  Also, we only did two layers of noodles in the lasagna.  It reheated great, just not my favorite flavors.

very good flavor, very moist, but not too much liquid. the last thing you want is dry lasagna, which this one was not. The only thing i would change is less rosemary.

The flavors in this dish are absolutely incredible! I only found a few small flaws. First, the rosemary is a bit overpowering and I will definitely use less next time. Second, I would suggest draining the vegetable mixture with the broth before adding sauce. The broth made the sauce a little too runny. Also, for a little healthy kick, I used whole wheat lasagna noodles. Nobody even noticed! I will definitely use this recipie again in the future!

Really liked this - pretty easy and tasty. Used the no boil lasagna noodles, 1/3 tsp dried rosemary and EVOO when sauteeing the onion and garlic.  For me, it was a tad on the bland side.  However, think the flavors will intensify overnight.  Will follow some of the recommendations others suggested the next time (using basil vs. rosemary, adding ricotta, using less veg broth, etc).  We know several vegetarians and think this recipe would really impress them.

So I made this next to perfect!  These were my changes:
1. I used fresh basil instead of rosemary
2. I used fresh Spinach
3. I used the no boil noddles
4. I used 3/4 can of the veggie broth
5. Instead of just mozzy cheese, I made a ricotta/mozzy mixture using egg.

My only complaint was that there wasn't enough 'meat' sauce to fill my 9 x 11 pan!  So good though!!

OMG!!!  This is soooo good!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I tweeked it according to other reviews.  I used the Quick and Easy Alfredo sauce from this site, sauteed the onion and garlic in EVOO, and added some basil.   I used oven-ready noodles.  I used light butter in the Alfredo sauce and light cheese in the lasagna.  Simply amazing!!!!

I LOVE this lasagna.  My friends always ask me to make it when we get together for girls night. You do have to make sure to really squeeze as much liquid out of the frozen spinach as you can - took me a few times making it to get the right consistency.  You can probably use less broth as well.  All in all, though, great flavors, nice and fairly healthy - great vegetarian option - I don't even miss the meat.

I never cook the noodles, and I do spread ricotta cheese on the dried noodles that I layer.  I usually add a homemade marinara sauce instead of a jar and sliced mushrooms.  LOVE IT!  It's always requested for birthday dinners.

This was soooo good!  I can only give it 4 stars though, because... rosemary?  Really?  DEFINITELY leave that out.   But otherwise, amazing!  I added mushrooms, used 16 oz. spinach, plain feta, and sprinked some dried italian herb mixture into the pan while everything simmered.  Everyone loved it, with approval from my fiance to make it again.  I didn't miss the meat at all, though he said it would *also* be really good with sausage in it. ;o)  Thanks for this great recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I've probably made 2 dozen different kinds of lasagna in my life, and this was one of the best. My dinner guests raved. I'm making it again this weekend. I took the advice of some other reviewers and did NOT use the vegetable broth at all. This produced the perfect consistency.

This lasagna was so yummy! A nice change from a traditional veggie lasagna.  The only changes I made were 1. I did not cover the veggie broth with a lid (some said theirs was too soupy so I figured I would let some evaporate) 2.  Instead of using a 28 oz jar of spaghetti sauce, I used a 15 oz. bertolli alfredo and then 13 oz. of homemade spaghetti sauce 3. I could not find garlic and herb feta so I substituted for california tomato and basil. 4. I used basil instead of rosemary.  My entire family raved about this recipe and literally every 5 minutes my grandma was saying how delicious it was.  Not only was it fabulous tasting but it was also easy to prepare.  To make it even easier, I think you could probably get away without boiling the noodles.

This was a pretty good lasagna recipe but could use one more layer to make it more interesting. Combining the veggies and sauce make it have many fewer different layers. Overall though, it tasted good. I used regular lasagna noodles but let them soak in hot water in the lasagna pan while I prepped the ingredients. Although they weren't cooked, they finished cooking up the liquid in the lasagna. The leftovers saved and reheated nicely. Just having feta on the top however made the top noodles more prone to dryness, even if using foil. Next time I would save a little sauce for the top and then cheese to protect the top noodles more.

This is a definate keeper and dare I say I might be so inclined to make this my "usual" lasagna!!!!!

I used no-boil noodles and an entire large bag of fresh baby spinach.
So as not to scare the family I threw the feta right into the sauce and once the noodles expanded (approx 30 minutes)I topped the edges with some more cheese.
Everyone, especially the kids, loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best lasagna I have ever made!  No, actually, it is the best lasagna I have ever tasted!  I used no-boil noodles, fresh baby spinach, and water packed artichoke hearts.  I had no time to make sauce, so I used Rao's marinara (in my opinion the very best jarred sauce available.  Not cheap, but worth every penny). I would serve this to my most discerning guests.  Even better reheated the next day, this recipe deserves ten stars.

This recipe is TERRIFIC!! I added a layer of ricotta cheese for a dinner party and everyone STILL raves months later at how terrific this dish was! It's decadent and delicious and very simple to make!

I absolutely love this recipe.  Just a hint: the No-Cook lasagne noodles work very well and cuts prep time down.  I am single, so I bake the lasagne and then freeze it in individual servings. It reheats very well!

I am just learning to cook, and this site is heaven sent!  I looked at all the suggestions that others had made to this recipe and incorporated some of them (I used 15 oz marinara sauce, 10 oz alfredo) and it turned out incredible!  I definitely recommend this one.

My modifications: used a 16oz jar of Creamy Alfredo instead of the tomato-based sauce; added a layer of sliced portabella mushrooms sauted in olive oil; used tomato-and-basil feta cheese which gave the dish some color; and used a veggie bouillon dissolved in 1-1/2 cups water for the broth. I highly recommend using marinated instead of un-marinated artichoke hearts as stated in the recipe. The results are AWESOME!! Thanks, David!

As written , I'm giving this 4 stars...but with the advice of other reviewers, this was easily a 5 star dish. I used fresh Spinach, no cook lasagna noodles,
2 cans of artichoke hearts instead of 1,added sautéed onions and Portabella mushrooms, and I added a layer of fresh mozzarella and ricotta (mixed with an egg, parsley, garlic, parm cheese) I couldn't find the garlic herb feta, so I just used regular. Also, I had some leftover spinach and artichoke dip from Costco and I layered that with the cheese layer...I wouldn't go out of my way to use the dip next time, I just wanted to get rid of it, but it was so good in there! Everyone gobbled this up! Oh- it was a bit watery as it was cooking, so I put a cookie sheet to catch the excess...but the finished product was not watery at all.

This was an excellent dish, I used ready to make noodles. My own home made sauce, Fresh spinach sautéed with garlic & white wine and the key is to squeeze the water out of the spinach before you assemble the lasagne but was super tasty

This was delicious!!  I added in some mushrooms that I needed to use and also used fresh spinach (had to use that up quickly, also.)  I actually pre-cooked the noodles like the recipe said, which I almost never do, but I liked it.  I added in some cottage cheese, also.  I might leave out part of the broth next time.  The feta on top got nice and roasted after I put it under the broiler to brown it on top and it was delightful.  Can't wait to make this again - SO GOOD!

This recipe was amazing! I used the no bake lasagna noodles which made this even easier, and it turned out great. For a lasagna this recipe was fairly quick, but maybe a little too time consuming for a weeknight meal for most people. Great for a Sunday night dinner though! Both of my boys ate it really well, and my two year old had three serving of it so I would say it was a success for us. Even without meat in this it is still very filling, and we have quite a bit left over so enjoy for the next couple of days. Next time I might add some mushrooms, which I would saute with the onion and garlic, but I didn't feel like anything was missing from the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Considering how much cheese is in this recipe, it's pretty amazing that it's under 400 calories. I cut the veggie broth to 8oz and added about 1/4 tbsp dried rosemary and 1/2 tbsp dried basil. I could taste the rosemary, but I wouldn't have wanted more than the amount I put in. Wateriness was not an issue - it was just right. I would make this again!

Yum! I made several changes (as recommended by other reviewers) and it was amazing! I used fresh spinach and no broth. I also added ricotta mixed with an egg and some nutmeg. It is a great vegetarian friendly recipe!

I brought this to a Christmas potluck and nearly everyone there asked for the recipe.  The flavors are fantastic and it was so easy to make.  I was pretty liberal with the cheese, used fresh baby spinach as opposed to frozen, and about 3/4 of the vegetable broth.  Will definitely make it again!

Great recipe!  I left out the rosemary (don't like the flavor), added mushrooms, and only used about half a jar of tomato sauce.  My husband loved it.  It also makes great leftovers, seems to get better each day!

Fantastic!!!  My (non-veg) husband loves this.  Took it to a party last night...a big hit with everybody.  I agree that not boiling the noodles is the way to go.  I also add chopped sun-dried tomatoes to each layer and sprinkle on top.

Looking for a meatless dish for a meat and potatoes family can be a real challenge. This one did the job. Everyone loved it. Did make changes based on personal preference and other reviews: Used fresh spinach!! It's less runny and better tasting. Did not cook the noodles. I was worried about that, but it worked great. Baked for 50 min, uncovered and baked 10 min more, then let rest for 10 minutes--no problem with it being runny like others did. Used basil instead of rosemary. Like someone else said, it was not a very "deep" dish lasagna. Next time I might consider adding a few more ingredients and an additional layer. I think black olives would be a nice addition, too! Thanks for the recipe!

This was heaven! I used classico roasted red pepper alfredo for the sauce. Since we don't like much rosemary I used a lot less. That is a personal taste though. We will eat this a lot

This lasagna was pretty delicious. I followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out to be a little runny so I would suggest using less tomato pasta sauce. But it was really good otherwise! Also, we added a touch of basil which was also very tasty.

Awesome lasagna!  I used oven ready noodles and there was the perfect balance of moisture.  I also added mushrooms.  Personally, the feta made it a bit salty, but next time I'll just buy a more milder feta.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Very good. But there wasn't enough of a tomato flavor for our taste. Next time I'll use more tomato sauce to balance the flavor of the spinach and artichoke. Used spaghetti noodles instead of lasagna, which worked very well. Also added ricotta cheese to the mozzarella which made for a rich cheese filling.

Just wonderful!  If you like artichoke dip, you'll love this, if made with Alfredo sauce.  Don't use the nasty alfredo in the jar; I used "Alfredo Sauce" by R. Swift on this site, and quadrupled the recipe (except for parm).  Took me about 10 minutes, and amount of sauce was perfect.  Only other change was to reduce rosemary to 1/2 t. dried.  Tip: the absolute best way to drain spinach is to squeeze the defrosted spinach between two plates.

This was my first time making vegetarian lasagna so I made this recipe nearly exact. I took some suggestions and used about 2/3 can of vegetable broth instead of the entire thing, I used 5 oz of fresh spinach instead of the frozen, I used tomato basil feta (couldn't find the recommended) on top, whole wheat lasagna noodles. YUM YUM! The longer it sits the more moisture it absorbs, so if there is a lot of liquid let it sit for more time. I definitely recommend using whole wheat lasagna noodles and I did boil them as instructed. It came out wonderful. Thanks for this recipe!

Awesome recipe! I altered the reciped per others reviews and used 3/4 to 1 cup of broth and did not boil the noodels as they cook in the sauce. Next time I may add some portabella mushrooms or use the classico sauce with mushrooms in it, as another person suggested.

A definite keeper.  I did pay attention to what other said about it being 'watery'.  To fix, I simply simmered the broth with the veggies until it was reduced to just a few tablespoons.  Also, I skipped the jarred sauce, and went for crushed tomatoes.  I strained out the really watery part of crushed tomatoes with a fine sieve, and was left with a nice thick consistency. I doctored the crushed tomatoes with oregano, crushed fennel, and a little bit of garlic.  I used 2 cans of tomatoes, and would probably use 3 next time.   Followed the recipe otherwise. I wasn't sure I'd like the rosemary, but it turned out to be delish.  The feta was a great choice too.

I really loved this recipe.
I had never made a vegetable lasagna without ricotta cheese, so I was a little worried about how it would turn out, but turn out it did!!!  
Actually, it was much less heavy than a typical lasagna.  We liked it a whole lot better than the spinach/ricotta lasagna I usually make.
Here are some recipe suggestions/modifications:
*Add a little less (1/2 cup less)   vegetable broth.
*I used organic vegetable broth.
*I used basil & rosemary.
*I used whole wheat pasta.
*I added mushrooms & zucchini.
Would double batch next time & freeze 2nd lasagna (Its always nice to have a stash of healthy frozen meals available).
Very very yummy!!

Fantastic!  This is a great meat free recipe and you don't even realize that it's vegetarian!  I used marinated artichoke hearts, cause that's what I had on hand, and the taste was great.  I also used fresh spinach with that after simmering covered for five minutes I removed the lid and let the liquid reduce for about five minutes.  It could have used 12 lasagna noodles opposed to 9.

The best veggie lasagna ever. I added extra artichokes because we love them and used a putenesca tomato sauce that added some great olive umph. Even better the next day!

Absolutely fantastic delicious awesome lasagna! I would give it more than five stars if I could! Even my meat-eating friends couldn't stop raving about it, no one missed the meat.  As previous reviewers suggested, did not pre cook noodles, and added some mushrooms. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and used an Italian 5 cheese blend since I had no mozza.  I will make this again and again!

Although this dish was quite good, I recommend that you get the artichoke hearts marinated in oil.  They are slightly more expensive, but the ones I got were in herbed vinegar and gave the dish that vinegar taste.  Luckily, it was not even noticable when I heated it up as left-overs.

Great flavor combination! I followed some previous suggestions and used alfredo instead of marinara sauce, and added a layer of sauteed portobello mushrooms. I found that the 28 oz. of sauce was too much, so I cut it by about a cup. Also, drained off some excess liquid from the artichoke/spinach mixture. I used fresh spinach, so that may explain it. Guests loved it.

I had to write in...what was the big fuss about this lasagna? I am a vegetarian always on the hunt for a good vegetable lasagna.  I found this recipe bland, and the absence of ricotta was dearly missed.  I won't be making this one again!

WOW!  We had this on a day when we were eating "meatless," and my picky husband and daughter liked it better than any lasagna I've made.  (And I've made a LOT of lasagna!)  The tastes of the artichoke and feta blend so well, and the taste is traditional and yet different at the same time.  Definitely one we'll make again!

An excellent dish.  Next time I might add substitute some ricotta for the mozzarella to give it more of a smooth texture expected from lasagna.

This is DELICIOUS!!! Absolutely, the BEST lasagna I've ever tasted.  I've made four batches already, and everyone loves them. When baking, I mixed crushed garlic and fresh oregano into the ricotta cheese.  I did not put any broth into the sauce, because it made it too watery. I also used garlic & herb feta cheese - DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for this recipe!!!!!!!

Didn't have pasta sauce, so used roasted tomato soup, loved it !  Hubby had 2 portions.   Next time I'm gonna leave the mozzarella  and mix creme fraiche (low fat) with the feta to give a more creamy topping.

We love this recipe, it truly is a keeper.  I have made this 9-10 times my husband is a son of a dairy farmer and it gets his approval.  I do change it up each time i make it, i will change the cheese depending on what i have, it will not matter.  But for even more flavor i do use the marinade from the artichokes as the broth, oh yes it is good, good, good.  For the 4 of us it will last for one dinner and lunch the next day.  Enjoy it is one of the best vegetarian recipes i've tried.

Turned out fantastic using no boil noodles.  Otherwise may have been a bit watery. Made this tonight for friends and they all thought it was delicious.  Will definitely add this recipe to my collection.

Very good!!!!! I just didn't make it lasagna style because I only had whole wheat pasta. I followed the directions otherwise.....EXCEPT I used fresh chopped spinach only because it was going bad. Other than that, this recipe was good ! If you follow me- you know I double the herbs and garlic for personal taste! Yum! Very good as left overs microwaved or re-heated in the toaster oven.

this is WAY too salty for me. i feel like i need to eat a lot of plain vegetables on the side with this. the taste, aside from salt, is pretty good. not my favourite vegetarian lasagna though and i will look for others. it was really easy to make though for a lasagna. i would omit the rosemary next time - the marinated artichokes and flavoured feta give it enough herbiness.

Delicious! The only change I made was to use regular uncooked lasagna noodles. They soaked up the juices and cooked in the same amount of time as the recipe calls for.

My family enjoyed this and have requested it again, although they prefer the white lasagna.  I forgot to thaw the spinach, so I didn't use the vegetable broth and instead used an extra 1.5 cups of sause.  We always add fresh basil to our lasagna and thought it worked very well with the rosemary.  Next time I'll add sauteed mushrooms to the vegetable mixture along with additional sauce as it was a bit dry.  A very forgiving recipe and very easy to customize to your family's taste.

4 pieces of advice: don't boil the noodles (put them in raw), add some chopped carrots along with the onions and garlic for more "meatiness", use 1 bag fresh spinach, replace rosemary with basil. It turned out spectacularly!

Well this was very good but I think I prefer my vegterian lasagna. I added a bit more garlic and seasoning. I also layered the feta cheese by lightly sprinkling on each layer. Yet, I think this was very good and very filling. I like it even more because my husband and child both liked it. I will make it again and one last thought....the mentioning of the lasgna coming out watery....lead me to add half the water. I used fresh spinach so this was a mistake. i should had added all of the water. The fresh spinach I just mixed into the mixture and put a lid on it and allowed it to sit for 5 minutes and it wilted all on it's own, which was more than enough.

We like to go meatless a few times a week and this recipe fit the bill. We will never go back to the traditional gabillion calorie recipe! I took the suggestion to NOT boil the noodles and it turns out perfectly. The noodles will absorb the extra moisture and it has never ends up being watery.

I've made this recipe for multiple potlucks, and it's a vegetarian hit every time!  The only minor changes I've made is that I use dried rosemary (about half the amount of the fresh); I sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top instead of crumbled feta; and I DON'T boil the noodles--the artichoke mixture has enough liquid with the broth and tomato sauce to boil the noodles while the lasagna cooks.  I've also successfully made it with an added ricotta layer, but you can follow the recipe as is and not go wrong.  This one is definitely a keeper!

This was ok but kind of bland. It could use a little more flavor and some meat!

This was good, and easy too. The only thing I would change next time is to add a bit of basil and DEFINITELY half the rosemary. Plus I would cut the spinach in HALF. Mine was a bit soupy, but not too bad. The noodles absorbed the moisture as it sat. I'm guessing it will probably be better tomorrow, but it's great today too!

I substituted the regular pasta sauce with alfredo. I know that's a huge change but, after changing the sauce, the result was so excellent I still had to give this recipe 4 stars. Everyone loved it!

This lasagna was fantastic! I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of broth. I also used homemade chicken broth instead of veggie, and used fresh wilted spinach instead of frozen (I hate frozen spinach). It turned out amazing! Even my husband, a total meathead, loved this lasagna (he didn't even raid the fridge later like he usually does after a veggie meal)!

This is a delicious recipe, but I had two problems.  The prep time is WAY longer than stated - it took me an hour, and the finished lasagna was very watery in the bottom - perhaps someone could help me with that ?

This is the best lasagna recipe I've found on this site so far!  Lots of flavor.  I made it just as written except that I used fesh spinach instead of frozen.

Loved this!  I used ready cook noodles, added some cubed tofu and parmesean to the mozzarella mix.  It would also be good with sauteed zucchini added into the main sauce mix.

Really good! I followed others' advice and used about 1/3 of a can of vegetable broth, and the consistency turned out just right. I also added some Parmesan cheese to the top. It turned out great!

This was delicious! It's time consuming but what lasagna isn't?:) And it was totally worth it. I did make some substitutions. I omitted the broth, didn't think it was necessary. Instead of frozen spinach I used fresh baby spinach by chopping it into smaller pieces. After I added the tomato sauce, also added a bay leaf and let it simmer for a bit. Instead of shredded mozzarella I used goat's cheese (I'm trying to avoid cow's milk). Because goat's cheese is stronger, I didn't use that much, just put little pieces on top of each layer. Didn't bother with the feta since I was already using goat's cheese. Delish! Even my 3 yr old asked for seconds! She's never asked for seconds for anything! Thanks for sharing! This is definitely a keeper!

This was AWESOME! I followed others suggestions and only used 1/2 the broth. I also added 1 chopped sweet yellow pepper because I had one on hand. I used a standard rectangular baking dish and made 12 noodles instead of the 9. I love feta cheese, but I sampled some of it with the sauce and found it a bit pungent for this dish, so I used mozzarella and parm on the top. I had some ricotta on hand, so I added a layer in the midddle. I used freah basil instead of the rosemary. It was one of the best lasangas I have ever had (boyfriend agrees)!!! Will make this again! I am not a vegetarian by any means but I did not miss the meat! SO GOOD!

I've done this recipe a few times now.  This lasagna always turns out great! I never add the rosemary (personal preference), I use Italian seasoning instead, and I always use oven-ready pasta that you don't have to boil. Sometimes I add other veggies mushrooms, zucchini, etc. and I've also substitute the tomato sauce for an alfredo sauce. I also sometimes add ricotta or cottage cheese mixed with an egg between layers. We love it!

The best thing I've made so far! With some advice taken from other reviewers (fresh basil instead of rosemary, garlic alfredo sauce, fresh spinach, and 1/2 can chicken stock) this turned out deeelish. I'm an amateur and this was my first lasagna, and one I'll definitely be making again.

I made this for a brunch last Sunday based on the recipe and reviews alone---what a hit! I used Pam Oil Oil but did also use a TBSPN of extra light olive oil. The flavors blended great--satisfied all guests including my vegetarian. Used no cook noodles-came out perfect!

Yum.  Very good.  I followed some of the other reviewers and did not precook the lasagna noodles.  Cooked well and moist.  I did not have a jar of spaghetti sauce, so used 1 each - 14 oz can diced tomato and tomato sauce, and a small can of tomato paste with Italian seasonings.  Didn't use as much rosemary.  Also used a cheese blend that included jack cheese as it was what I had on hand and added sliced olives.  Definite keeper.

This was my first dish as a new veggie diet lover.  I really enjoy this dish (even my eat loving husband likes it).  My only addition would be a little more seasoning.  I threw in some italian seasoning for just a little extra flavor.

As reading the other reviews I did not cook the noodles, I used fresh spinach and added ricotta and egg with the mozzarella layer. Very tasty.  I have a house full of meateaters that were skeptical of no meat in their lasagna, but everyone loved it.

Awesome recipe!  I loved the twist of artichokes and feta with the spinach in the lasagna.  I threw in the artichokes and juice and the spinach (still half frozen), and it was yummy.  I saved it as a favorite.

I originally made this recipe as a vegetarian alternative to the traditional meat lasagna for a party.  Even the meat eaters loved this... it disappeared long before the regular lasagna.  One change I did make was on the sauce.  I intended to make it with alfredo sauce, but accidentally bought the wrong size - only a 22 oz instead of 28.  In a pinch, I mixed in a 6 oz can of tomato sauce to the alfredo and it turned out great.  Will probably make the same way next time.

decent lasagna, not the best i've made.  it wasn't quite what i was expecting.  seemed bland even though i added quite a bit of other spices, etc.  i think the tangy feta was my favorite part.

We added chicken and it was delicious!  Next time I will add more mozarella and an extra layer of herbed feta in the middle.  Loved it!

Delicious. I've made this several times. Now I skip the rosemary, double the garlic, and used plain feta. No need to boil the noodles prior to cooking. Enjoy!

Absolutely, hands down, the BEST meatless lasagna I have ever had!  Will be a staple in our house!  I followed suggestions to add extra pasta sauce, use no-boil noodles, and fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  Didn't have feta, so tossed extra mozzarella on top at the end.  Turned out fantastic - table of 8 all asked for seconds and thirds!

A good, basic recipe to start. Used 3/4 cup vegetable broth and did not cook the noodles beforehand. Just needs more spices to kick up the flavor. Delish!!

We LOVED this lasagna and so did our guests.    I made a few changes:  I used no-cook noodles, did not use the rosemary or the vegetable broth, but ended up having to use an extra 1/2 can of spaghetti sauce, so I'll try the broth the next time I make this if I decide again to not cook the noodles ahead.  I added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms (sauteed them with the other vegetables) and I used regular feta on the top, but also added some mozzarella.    So so so so good!

This was excellent!  My boyfriend who doesn't like leftovers wants to eat this again tomorrow night!  I used about 20 oz of artichokes and only half a can of vegetable broth and it was the perfect consistency.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous and then some.  I will freeze the leftovers and serve my vegetarian daughter.  I will leave out the salt when cooking the noodles but will not change anything else because nothing could improve this fantastic recipe.

Excellent!  I needed a vegetarian option for a dinner party we were hosting, and this one turned out to be the most popular even amongst the meat-eaters!  Took advice from other reviewers and cut down on the amount of liquid (used broth from a can of green beans), and it turned out great!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Prepared with dried rosemary and I didn't have feta cheese to top the lasagna so I ust used more mozarella.  We thought it was great and hubby deemed it a "do again".  We'll make sure we have feta cheese next time.

Very good and unique recipe.  Had it for company and they said they could barely tell there wasn't any meat in it because it was so hearty.  Will make again and again.

This was my first vegetarian dish and I think it's a great substitute for a typical lasagna. The flavor in this dish is well balanced—the crumbled garlic feta is a must. I have slightly modified the recipe by adding a little bit of ricotta cheese to the artichoke/spinach mixture.

This lasagna is awesome!  I'm not a fan of the typical "veg lasagna" with white sauce and various vegetables, but this is out of this world.  My family could not get enough of it.  Tip:  Add more moz and feta (you can't have too much).  Also, I used the "no boil" noodles and this made this dish really ez and quick to make.

This was delicious! I too followed the advice of some reviews and added a ricotta cheese layer (ricotta,  egg, parmesan cheese and fresh chopped parsley) I believe it bulked up the final result and prevented it from becoming watery as some reviews complained of. This recipe was requested by several of my dinner guests. I will definitely make it again in the future!

Really delicious! I followed just about everything exactly as written expect I added mushrooms, used only an 8 oz bag of muenster cheese (all I had and didn't want it to become a cheese gut bomb) and used grated parmesan instead of feta. Sprinkled dried basil on top as garnish. I found the amount of sauce listed was plenty. I'll probably use ricotta and mozzarella next time, just because I love them both. Wish I had more leftovers!

This recipe won first place at a football party/lasagna cook-off contest! Way to go!   Drain the excess broth that doesn't evaporate before you put the sauce in. Also, use a high quality jarred sauce and add more artichokes if you prefer a stronger artichoke taste.  Oh, and make sure to  top w/ cheese and sauce, not just cheese.   This is a definite crowd pleaser!

This was fantastic.  I plan to add some mushrooms, and I left off the feta because I dislike it, but otherwise easy as can be.  I even used no-boil lasagna noodles which made it even easier.  Get yourself a good quality pasta sauce, it will make a difference!

Very good and a nice twist on the usual lasagna. I changed it a bit by adding a layer of ricotta mixed with one egg and the mozzarella which added great flavor and texture. Also used only half the broth and no bake noodles so it was pretty solid and not too runny.

I really wanted to make this more of a vegetable lasagna, so I added baby bellas, squash, zucchinni, fresh basil, fresh baby spinach, and a pinch of fresh rosemary. To make it healthier, I used Pam Olive Oil Spray coating, whole wheat uncooked lasagna, and lowfat cottage cheese for the first two layers, part-skim mozzarella for the top two layers.I used canned artichokes in water, finely chopped and a Vidalia onion.I also added thyme and oregano, and used a packet of Bertolli's  Summer Crushed Tomato and Basil Pasta Sauce 13.5 oz.. Adding freshed cracked black pepper and kosher salt....mama mia. I've never made a veggie lasagna before, but this will be a staple in my house from now on. Thanks for the base recipe!

You'd think that the marinated artichokes would make it too sour, but they didn't because you have to drain the marinade before using the artichokes. This recipe turned out GREAT, and my boyfriend who is not at all kitchen/cooking friendly made this lasagna ON HIS OWN because it was so easy! **He did put 4 smallish-medium cloves of garlic, though, instead of 4.5 because my pregnant sister is sensitive to garlic, and she was even able to take seconds!

Great lasagna!  We added about 1/2 of a fifteen ounce container of ricotta - jus a little per layer.  Other than that followed recipe to a T.  Next time I may try switching oregano for the rosemary.  Although we did like it with the rosemary too.  Even my 14 month old gobbled it up!  Thanks - will make again!

FANTASTIC.  I made this for Christmas (it's red and green!) and I was asked by 3 people for the recipe.  I made it the night before and put in the fridge.  Took out about 1 hour before cooking.  Delish!  I only used about 1/4 to 1/2 cup veggie broth.

Even though I made a few changes, I still give this 5 stars because I think overall it is a great recipe. My husband, a big meat lover, said it was really good. And I know he wasn’t just saying so, because he ate almost half the pan. Also, my in-laws, who used to run a catering business, loved it. I think the broth can be either cut way down, drained out of the spinach mixture before adding to layers, or left out entirely. For those reviewers that said they were missing the ricotta, all you have to do is put it in there – I did, and it was awesome. The other changes I made were Italian seasoning instead of fresh rosemary, half an onion instead of a whole one, chicken broth instead of veggie, and a little heavy cream to make it ‘pink’. It’s even better the next day (if your family even leaves any for the next day!)

Delicious! I took the advice of another reviewer and added a ricotta/mozz blend. I also added two portabello mushrooms. I was very happy with the results, and am looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow!

This was the best lasagna I've ever had, much less made!  I did modify a few things (not drying the spinach and not putting any vegetable broth at all, and I used whole wheat lasagna cooked until not quite al dente), but the overall execution was just superb and I know I'll make it again!  :)

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I've been making it for years now, and am finally rating it.  My vegetarian friends love it and I've even been commissioned to make a bunch of these for a party.  I add an extra 8 ounce can of tomato sauce b/c it needs just a tad bit more for me.  Also I use the Barilla no cook lasagna noodles to make it simple.  YUMMY!

To-Die-For!! This is unbelievably delicious! I used marinated artichoke hearts from the jar and the thawed, frozen spinach; however, I can't wait until the spinach ban lifts so that I can try this with fresh baby spinach. I am going to recommend this to my Cooking Friends for our monthly dinner party. Wow! Thanks.

Awesome. Very tasty.  I used 2 fresh spinach bundles instead, no broth, just the juice from the artichoke (non marinated).  I also put a layer of cottage cheese w/ some parm. to give it a real lasagna taste.  It was awesome!!  I threw in some onion salt, garlic salt and oregano as well.

The husband gave it a perfect 10!  I took the advice of many others and didn't boil the noodles. I also skipped the feta cheese and used parmesan instead.  It turned out great!

I wasn't very thrilled with this recipe.  I think that the broth soaks into the spinach and makes the flavor taste strange.  The artichoke hearts were lost in there.  Next time I will try it without any broth to get the artichoke and spinach flavors to come through.

Very, very good and simple to make.  Prepared in the morning, put in fridge, took out around 5:00 and brought a little closer to room temp, popped in oven, and voila... delicious.  I did not cook the noodles, just put them in uncooked.  Other than that, prepared just as is except I seasoned the artichoke mixture with a little salt as it was simmering.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  But I did take others advice and made the following changes:  did not cook the noodles, added mushrooms with the onions, didn't use rosemary b/c didn't have any, drained all juices from mixture before adding sauce, added italian tomato paste with sauce, layered with ricotta cheese mixture (ricotta, parsely, oregano, egg, and pepper) and baked for 50 minutes.  FABULOUS!! Definitely on the make again list

I brought this to a potluck and had many rave reviews. I did make a few changes. Since I didn't have any vegetable broth, I added the liquid from the marinated artichokes. Added sliced mushrooms at that point and let most of the liquid cook out before adding the spinach, artichokes and sauce. For the cheese layer I mixed together ricotta, parmesan, mozzerella and two eggs. (I love ricotta! But no gritty supermarket brands...I always buy from an Italian market...so much better!) I didn't have any feta either but I don't think it mattered. I will be making this again and again.

This has become my lasagna recipe. It's flavor is ALWAYS delicious. I have made it for dinner parties at home, potlucks, and even as a care package for sick friends. Everyone always finishes the whole thing. It reheats wonderfully in the microwave too! Thanks for posting this divine lasagna recipe.

I've made this twice.  The second time I added ricotta to give it a bit more body, everyone loved it.  I don't boil the lasagna noodles before baking, it's not necessary.

This lasagna was wonderful!  I usually don't make lasagna all that often, but this was a great change from your usual dish!  It was easy to prepare, as all your ingredients are done in one pan.  I also didn't cook the noodles before baking, if you add about 12 cup of liquid to the artichoke and spinach mixture it will cook the noodles during the bake time.  It held it's shape when I served it (which is a problem I've had with other lasagna's) and it tastes even better the next day.  Even my husband who only likes meat sauce liked this dish!  Thanks for a new family dinner!

I was very excited to make ts because I enjoy all of the ingredients.  I used marinated artichoke hearts and they really wrecked the dish!  The taste is good at first, but the after taste is vinegar and the marinade the artichokes came in.  It was awful.  A great recipe, just do not get marinaded artichoke hearts!!

Wonderful with the following additions:
I used alfredo sauce AND spaghetti sauce, which combined was awesome! (Double the sauce from the recipe.) I also added a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with one egg, some parsley, and some mozzarella. One substitution I made, but will not make again, was  whole wheat lasagna noodles. I did not care for them. I also did not cook the noodles first - no need, just add about 1/2 cup of water to the pan before baking.
Great recipe!

I can't believe someone rated this "just o.k.!" This is the BEST lasagne I have ever tasted, with meat or without. I use Classico's Spicy Red Pepper tomatoe sauce, and it blends really nicely and adds a bit more flavor. I'm often suspicious of feta, but it works really well with this dish! It's easy to make, and though it takes some time, it's definetely worth it.

I made this recipe last night. I found it very easy to make & my boyfriend practically ate the entire pan!  I used oven ready-no boil lasagna, fresh spinach instead of frozen, alfredo sauce & marinara sauce,& organic mushrooms. Next time we are going to add chicken!!  Thanks for sharing David.

This is fabulous!!  We enjoy this lasagna better than a regular meat lasagna.  It's great with extra cheese! We also added portabella mushrooms and that added additional great taste and presentation.  We have made this several times and every time we have served it everyone has asked for the recipe! You won't be disappointed.

This is a wonderful meal and easy to make!  I bought all the stuff to make this and forgot to buy the lasagna noodles, so I just used spiral noodles I had on hand and prepared the dish as if I were using lasagna noodles.  It turned out just fine.  Can't wait to make again!

The best lasagna recipe ever! You will not miss the ricoota cheese which can be too much sometimes. The flavors are wonderful and even the non veggies loved it. No one missed the meat at all. Replaces my old lasagna recipe.

I'm a conservative.  I eat meat.  but I was making dinner for one of my liberal vegetarian friends.  I, not wanting to disappoint a lady, made this.  It was great!  It's the rosemary that really makes it good--fresh is a must!

I really enjoyed this recipe, though I made some changes.  I used the no boil lasagna noodles and they worked just fine.  I also added a layer over the spinach and artichoke layer, of a ricotta mixture (ricotta cheese, 1 egg, mozzerella cheese, parsley some salt & pepper)--sorry, I don't have the exact measurements, I tend to cook by taste and visual appearance.  I think this added layer of cheeses gave the dish more substance.  My vegitarian daughter just loved it, and so did her meat eating brother.  Very yummy and consider this recipe a keeper.

This recipie is a great alternative to the normal meat sauce lasagna. I found it to be a little soupy, so I've cut the veg. broth by 1/3 and found that it made a perfect batch!

My whole family really enjoyed this dish.  I added mushrooms to it, and drained the vegetable broth.  It turned out wonderful.  Next time I'll put more spinach in it, and use marinated artichoke hearts. :)

This recipe is delicious!!  Served it for company and everyone loved it.  This will replace my old lasagna recipe!  I did have to add a little extra sauce for the top layer because I guess I used too much of it before I got there.

This was absolutely wonderful!  We even forgot to add the pasta sauce and it was still delicious.

This is absolutely fabulous.  My picky kids and husband loved it.  In fact my 5-year-old asked if we could have it everyday.  I highly recommend this one!!

this was a good veggie lasanga. the flavored feta on top was interesting and really added a lot of flavor.  i added portabella mushrooms for a little more texture- good. might try a white sauce next time instead of red.

My husband hates artichokes and spinach, I love them.  Thanks to this recipe I don't have to cook them for myself anymore.  It looked, smelled and tasted like something I would pay $15 a plate for at an Italian Restaurant; but it came out of MY oven.  This is a definate "do over".

This is my new favorite lasagna recipe, hands down.  I first tried it when we were having some vegetarian friends over for dinner, and everyone was begging for the recipe!  I like the texture of artichoke hearts so i only cut them into quarters instead of chopping them.  When i make it just for our family i add 3/4 lb of cooked ground sausage to the sauce, since we're meatatarians.  It turns out great every time!  I always double the recipe and freeze one for later, to save time, since it is an intensive dish to make.

It was a little watery for my first time making it, but I think that's because I didn't drain my noodles right away, and also could have let the sauce simmer a little longer before adding it to the pan. Even so, the first time I made it everyone at the table had seconds, and my 1 year old had 3 helpings! :D I didn't even think she would like it, but every time we came in from outside and smelled it cooking all of us could hardly wait to eat it.

Delicious!!!!  I did use no boil noodles, add portabella mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and used fresh spinach; however, this is a fabulous base recipe that is very easy.  That's what cooking is all about -- make it your own -- try it several different ways.  Thanks so much for this great recipe -- I will use it again and again!  Also, the re heated leftovers are almost better than "right out of the oven"!

I made this recipe with some of the modifications from the reviews, mainly adding portobello mushrooms, basil instead of rosemary, and Alfredo sauce instead of tomato. It was incredible! All of our 12 dinner guests LOVED it!!

My family loved this recipe and I'll definitely be making it again.  I used the no-cook lasagna noodles.  I used 1 cup of water with 1 tsp chicken base.  I used 2 (28 oz) jars of Alfredo sauce with sun-dried tomatoes. I used fresh spinach and rosemary.  I drained my artichoke hearts before chopping.  Excellent!!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I made it for 2013 Christmas.  We just finished the last of it from my freezer last week.  Tasted just as good if not better reheated.  Froze very well.   Thanks All Recipes you have never disappointed me with your recipes

Pretty darn good! I didn't have spinach so I substituted in lots of fresh kale. And used homemade dried rosemary instead of fresh. I didn't boil my noodles beforehand and it turned out fine. I kind of liked the feta on top but I don't think it needed it. With it, the dish was pretty salty and I didn't add any salts to my sauteed veggies or anywhere.

Loved this recipe!  I used fresh spinach and also added some diced black olives to the mixture using an alfredo sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  I also added the ricotta cheese, which I feel is necessary for lasagna.  I did however use a light alfredo sauce to combat some of the calories and you couldn't tell with all of the different cheeses.  I also used oregano instead of rosemary.  I used about 10 ounces of vegetable broth and added the artichoke juice instead.  My boyfriend loved it!

I made this for my husband, and we thought it was great.  Instead of cooking the pasta, I put the nine noodles in a separate pan of hot water while preparing the other ingredients.  I added feta cheese to each layer of mozzarella and made my own gravy (tomato sauce).  The only other thing I would suggest is using 32 oz. of tomatoes or tomato sauce instead of the recommended 28 oz because the extra liquid is needed if you don't cook the lasagne noodles beforehand.  (And I don't recommend pre-cooking them because they will cook properly in the oven, without any gumminess.)

This was a nice alternative to the traditional lasagna.  It lacked a little in "body" due to no ricotta/cottage cheese, but we didn't really miss it.  The great thing about this recipe is that none of the ingredients spoil quickly, so you can buy everything and wait until it's the most convenient to make it.  Couldn't really come up with anything that needs to change in the recipe, hence the 5 stars!

I used spinach lasagna noodles and added mushrooms and fresh basil. Make sure to use fresh, good quality cheese and it will turn out delicious and tasting like something ordered from a gourmet Italian cafe. Repeat recipe for sure!

I made this recipe using a couple of suggestions from other reviewers as well as my own. I used 2 cups of veggie broth; didn't cook my noodles; 1 TBL dried basil instead of the rosemary; added 1 tsp oregano; instead of the frozen spinach, I used a bag of baby spinach and chopped it; added lg container of sliced fresh mushrooms (sauteed with the onion); added large container of cottage cheese to the layers and sprinkled parmesan within the layers.
I was worried when the lasagna first came out of the oven, because there was a little water on top (I removed with a paper towel). The lasagna was moist but not runny and the layers stayed together. It was delicious! Next time I might add diced rotisserie chicken (my BF missed the meat, but I didn't). 
Thank you for a great recipe!

This was really good and easy to prepare.  The only thing I changed was to NOT cook the noodles first.  It turned out perfect!  I love not having to cook the noodles first, it makes it so much easier to make!

Delicious! I did use about 1/3 of the broth called for and it was still a bit too much since I pre-cooked the noodles.  Next time I will omit.  I added 16oz of sliced mushrooms which really helped bulk this up as well as fresh spinach.  In the future I would add more artichokes as well.  I also used 15oz alfredo mixed with 13oz spaghetti sauce which was delish.  I wanted to use all alfredo, but didn't have enough and I enjoyed this combo, as did my guests.

Wait. I've never reviewed this before?! I could have sworn.. Anyway, shame on me for not giving this 5 stars sooner. This is my absolute FAVORITE lasagna! I took suggestions that it was too watery and cut back on the vegetable broth the first time (only left about an ounce or two in the can) and threw in the whole jar of artichoke hearts with the marinade and everything. That was when I personally liked it best, but I noticed a lot of people saying it was too "vinegary." I made it with a coworker this past Friday and her and her mother RAVED. I added ricotta/egg/nutmeg mixture to the mozzarella cheese layer, used and entire package of no-boil noodles (I like my lasagna noodles rolled flat), a whole can of broth and just a little (ounce or so) of the artichoke marinade. I'll definitely use the ricotta again next time. I think the measurements would be perfectly fine, not too watery if you used an entire package of lasagna noodles to soak it all up.

I did not have any feta cheese, but it was FABULOUS even without it. All members of my family consumed multiple helpings, including my 18-month old. Wonderful flavor! I did throw in a couple shredded chicken breasts with the artichoke mixture (sorry, couldn't resist) and it was the perfect meal!

This lasagna turned out fantastic!  I followed some other reviews that said the noodles didn't have to be cooked beforehand and just used oven ready noodles and mine didn't turn out runny at all.  I also added a layer of eggplant (cut lengthwise) and ricotta cheese and topped with cheddar rather than feta.  Turned out fantastic and was super easy to make!  Will definitely be making again!

This is fantastic - I followed suggestion of others and did not cook the noodles ahead of time - I also reduced the broth amount to about 10oz. and used a 16oz package of frozen spinach.  I would definitely make this again - hearty but not too heavy and really good flavor combo.

It's okay. It's not horrible, it's not great, it's just okay.

I thought the artichokes add too much sweetness, but I could have not cut them fine enough. There's just a hint of umami, which I thought could have been brought out more, so if I make it again, I'd add mushrooms or olives (I don't even like olives, but I think they'd be a good addition to this dish). 

I do like the idea of putting spinach in lasagna, the spinach itself isn't overpowering, and seems like a good way to get more vegetables. 

I assembled this the night before, and stuck it in the fridge, then upped the baking time to 1 hour covered and 30 minutes uncovered. I couldn't find herb and garlic feta, and I didn't want to buy fresh rosemary that I knew would go to waste, so I used a large helping of dried Italian seasoning instead. I also used the oil from the marinade to sautee the onions and garlic.

This is actually my first vegetarian dish.  My only substitution was soy cheese, and I made a faux feta from tofu.  My family loved it!  We are true meat eaters and with this lasagna, we didn't miss a beat!!

This is an amazing recipe...I love vegetarian lasagna, and this tastes incredibly gourmet for how relatively easy it is. The rosemary makes the dish, in my opinion. I have made it a few times now, and the only changes I would recommend are:
1. Use less broth, maybe about 2/3 of the can. Otherwise it's too watery.
2. Add a can of Italian stewed tomatoes. This is a personal preference, but I don't think it's quite tomato-y otherwise.
3.Add some fresh chopped basil. It complements the rosemary nicely.

This was an excellent recipe!  The only changes I made were added mushrooms, a little italian seasoning and using only half a teaspoon of rosemary.  My husband, who is a self-proclaimed carnivore, loved this dish!  Its definitely a keeper!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!! I used the no cook lasagna noodles, and just topped the sauce on top, with the cheese. I left out the vegetable broth, used fresh spinach, used my own home made spaghetti sauce, which had sweet italian sausage and hamburger, added ricotta cheese, and left out the feta, OH - and used roasted Garlic!!!  Dish was gone in a couple days, and hubby wants me to make more! Making more today!

Could do without the overpowering feta. Also agree with the others to put in uncooked noodles or it will be soggy.

I used ricotta cheese (seriously, it's lasagna!) and made some alterations to seasoning, but followed the recipe for the most part.  I didn't have any issues with the batch turning out too soupy.  Really good!  I would make it again.

I liked the flavor on this, but the spinach was very strong and overwhelmed the lazagna.  I was looking for something to serve for a dinner party and thought that this recipe was not good enough to serve to guests.

Instead of rosemary i used basil and oregano. I also increased the amount of sauce to fit my taste. I have made it twice now; second time i omitted the artichokes for fresh mushrooms, just as good.

I made this recipe last night and it was amazing. The only changes I made were I used EVOO instead of spray and I mixed some Italian Turkey sausage into the sauce. Mine wasn't watery at all. Make sure to squeeze ALL the water out of the spinach. And let it simmer on the stove for a little longer to reduce it. Soooo delicious.  Even better the next day.

This lasagna is awesome! Everyone went up for seconds. I used spinach lasagna noodles, added 1 tsp. dried rosemary instead of 1 tbsp. fresh rosemary, which tasted so good in it!  I only had a 10 oz. can of veg. broth that worked out perfectly, and I did not add the feta on top, just extra mozzarella. It was amazing, will definitely make again!  
**update**  I made this again for a larger number of people and doubled the filling except I stuck with only 1 onion, probably about a can & half of broth, and 1tbsp dried rosemary. Also, I did not boil the noodles first. Delicious once again!!

This was good but I think my measurements were off a bit so I ended up with a very oniony lasagna. I would add a bit more artichoke I think and try the ricotta cheese layer someone reviewed before me. Worth making again though.

It tasted awesome, but much too watery. Probably didn't need the veg broth at all, or at least I should have strained it before adding the tomato sauce.

This is a fantastic recipe! This went so fast that I don't think we'll ever be using our old lasagna recipe again! It is a vegetarian dish and my family likes lots of meat, so I browned two packages of Jimmy Dean ground sausage and added it to the artichoke mixture after I stirred in the pasta sauce. The sausage takes up a lot more room, so I ended up only having room for 2 layers of noodles. Fantastic recipe!

This recipe was decent. I enjoyed it more then my husband. I made it as directed except for I used no cook lasagna noodles and fat free feta. Even still, there was a little bit of extra juices in my lasagna. The artichoke in this recipe is the star, so if you aren't a big fan you may not want to try this recipe.

YUMMY! Almost fail proof! I made a few changes. I only used 1/2 can broth. I used a bag of fresh spinach. I added a little alfredo sauce to the red sauce. I also added a nice layer of ricotta. You could do so much with this one! MMMMMMMMmmmmm!

Like every recipe, I considered this a base and since some people said the lasagna was flat and water I made some changes (still gets 5 stars though :D). I normally make "World's Best Lasagna--which is also fantastic, but I wanted a change of pace, so here we go.  First, I doubled the onion and garlic and sauteed in olive oil, I didn't have fresh rosemary so I threw in dried rosemary and basil. I added TWO cans of artichokes and TWO packages of thawed, drained frozen spinach and left out the veggie broth but salted to compensate. I used a vodka creme sauce, rinsed the jar, then added another half jar of tomato basil sauce, and finally threw in 8 oz creme cheese. This gives the mixture a gorgeous orange color and thick texture that is tempting to eat as is. For assembly, I used enough of the mixture to cover the bottom and then 4 al dente noodles oriented length wise in the 13x9 pan and half of one perpendicular to the rest at the end for complete coverage. I then added about 1/3 of the ricotta mixture which I doubled and spiced with italian herbs and salt. This was covered with a light layer of shredded mozzarella and then then 1/3-1/2 the spinach artichoke mixture. These layers were repeated and then I topped it with one more layer of noodles and whatever was left plus around 6 ounces of Feta. With the additions and alterations, the lasagna was taller than the 9x13 so I oiled the foil to prevent cheese stick-age. The result is about 10 servings and it reheats wonderfully

Excellent blend of flavors!  I used whole wheat lasagna noodles, added shaved carrots to the artichoke mixture and used a spicy tomato sauce.  I was worried by the addition of the feta, only because it doesn't seem like an italian ingredient, but it was surprisingly delightful!  My husband couldn't rave enough about this meal!

My husband loved this but I found it to be way too garlicy and salty.  Next time I would cut down on the garlic a LOT and probably try and have fresh or steamed artichokes instead of marinated or canned.

Kids loved it!  I thought it was ok. I made 2 8x8 pans. Made one that night and froze the other. I liked it ok. But kids even ate leftovers willingly.

Delicious! I didn't have vegetable stock so just used water. I skipped cooking the lasagna noodles and just used them out of the box. The whole family really enjoyed this dish!

AMAZING!!!  I made exactly as written with one exception, I did NOT pre-cook the noodles and it was perfect!!!  I usually do not care for Feta cheese but it is absolutely amazing on top of this lasagna.  It's my new favorite meal.

My husband thought this was really great...I had no beef so I used chunks of chicken that I had cooked earlier.  I also added minced garlic and onion as well as chopped bell pepper.  Yum!  And so easy too!

Excellent recipe! I didn't have any vegetable stock so I used the water from the can of artichoke hearts instead. My husband doesn't even like artichokes and he had 2 servings! Definitely a keeper.

Oh my goodness. This will be added to my list of staples. Everyone in my house, including friends and family, loved this lasagna. I made it with the no-bake noodles, which was a mistake, but I only have myself to blame for that one. They got too done (soggy).  The pasta sauce with the spinach and artichoke was genius.  Also the feta was awesome. I used a sun dried tomato feta because that's what was available at my local store. It was great, and I would imagine any flavored feta would rock.

This is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! I made it for a dinner for about 12 people and everyone loved it, even those who do not like artichokes and/or spinach!!! The only change I made was, I used alfredo sauce instead of pasta sauce!!! Sooooo good!!!

This was outstanding.  My husband and I AND our toddler loved it.  The only change I made was draining most the vegetable broth before adding the pasta sauce, and I used a dash of nutmeg and omitted the rosemary.  I will definitely be making this again!!

This was absolutely delicious- even my 18-month-old gobbled it up!  I have to admit that my boyfriend refuses to eat a meal without meat, so I browned 1lb of Italian sausage and layered that in as well.  It certainly didn't hurt the flavor and helped to vary the texture and maybe absorb some of the extra liquid that other reviewers had complained about.

Oh my goodness.  This was AMAZING.  I tweaked the recipe ever so slightly by adding a jar of sliced mushrooms to the spinach/artichoke mix, used no-boil noodles, added ricotta cheese between the layers and used 1/2 the amount of vegetable broth.  I was asked to make this again...on a weekly basis if possible!

this is a great lasagna.  i actually preferred this recipe over our regular meat lasagna. i did not have rosemary or feta on hand so i left those out. i added a 14oz can of diced tomatoes when i added the broth to give it a little more body. bought a 32oz bottle of sauce so i added all of that and just threw my noodles in the pan raw and they came out perfect in the end. no sogginess found here. will make again.

This dish is exceptional!!! I found it a little watery too, so I just cut down (about 2oz) on the vegetable stock. I have made this dish over and over again. So easy and so good!!! The leftovers (if there are any, are amazing!)

This was an amazing lasagna!  Used an organic "puttanesca" sauce for the pasta sauce, which is a bit spicy with olives... and combined with the artichokes and herb/garlic feta, was a very "spicy Mediterranean" , delicious flavor.  This is a recipe I will use over and over!

Made some modifications to the recipe: Ready bake lasagna noodles Dry rosemary Chicken stock  Great recipe, great flavor and taste. Easy to make. If you're using dry rosemary, use 1/4 - 1/2 tbs CHOPPED instead of 1 tbs. I used 1 tbs and it was way too much but it still tasted good.

This was just OK.  Nothing great.  My vegetarian DS said it was good.  I did not cook the noodles and it was just the right amount of liquid.  Maybe those who thought it was too much juice did not let it sit after baking?

I used "no boiling required" lasagna noodles, and it still came out juicy. I will cut down on the veg broth next time. I took a reviewer's advice about cutting back on fresh rosemary, and I used about 1 tsp, and it was noticeable, so I'm glad I did not use a tbsp. Other than that, it was pretty tasty. I will make this again, and next time it will be perfect.

As is stands it wouldve been a 4, but I made some modifications to this recipe which in my taste brings it to 5 stars: Not a big thyme fan, so used fresh basil. I know this is more a veggie lasagna, but ya need cheese! I added a layer of cheese mix (10 oz ricotta, 1 egg, some salt, pepper, parsley, oregano and basil w/ the mozzarella) where the mozz was, I didn't pre-cook the noodles so they would soak up the soupiness that other reviewers mentioned. I also layered differently: noodles, cheese mix, sauce mix. (putting a thin coat of plain sauce under the first noodles, so they won't stick!) My fiancee and friends really liked this! Very good!

I served this to guests and they ate almost all of it and then begged for the recipe. And it was so easy! You don't have to boil lasagna noodles -- just soak them in the sink in hot water for 20 minutes -- a wonderful shortcut on a hot summer day. I didn't have vegetable broth, so used chicken broth. At room temp this tastes just delicious, so would be a good thing for a potluck.

My family loved this lasagna. I only made three small changes.  I did not cook the noodles as others suggested.  I did not have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth.  I did not use rosemary because I was out.  I agree with others this would have been soupy if I had cooked the noodles but it was perfect with regular noodles uncooked and we did not miss the rosemary at all.  Great recipe.

I doubled the recipe as one user suggested to give it more height and used fresh spinach.  Didn't pre-cook the noodles and let it sit in the fridge overnight which softened the noodles naturally.  The recipe wasn't at all watery, but it did require an extra 45 minutes of cook time in the oven.  delish!

This was very good. After his first bite, my bf said "You can make this anytime!" then proceeded to inhale 3 pieces. He had it for breakfast the next morning too! My friends loved it and so did I.

I did this for a pot luck and it got great reviews.  I did think it had a little too much liquid.  Next time I will do a ricotta or cottage cheese mixture instead of the mozzarella throughout.

This is so great.  You have to watch the fluid a bit.  Make sure the water is squeezed well out of the spinache or cut the chicken broth a bit.  But even with the excess juice, it still tasted great.  I have fed it to company before and all were happy.

Excellent recipe that the whole family enjoyed, even my slightly spinach squeamish son. Might add something for a little more tang/kick next time, perhaps a little more garlic, but overall a great recipe.
___________________

Update: I made this again and the only differences were that I used no-boil noodles and I steamed some kale instead of the spinach. I can't imagine those 2 made that huge a difference but man, the flavor in this dish is AMAZING. Great recipe!

This is a great change from typical vegetarian lasagna. I really like artichokes (and spinach), but there was so much that the paper-like texture got tiresome to chew. I think next time I will cut the amount of artichoke in half and replace it with mushrooms. I added ricotta and would recommend this. 
The recipe did make a lot and it boiled over.

Great recipe!  I varied it a bit - used no boil noodles, subed tomato sauce for alfredo sauce and added mushrooms and ricotta cheese, (to make it a "white lasagna").  I also omitted the broth all together, because most of the comments said it turned out watery.  Next time I'll use half the broth because mine turned out a bit dry.  Otherwise, definitely a keeper!

This was amazing.  We don't eat wheat, so I used no-boil rice lasagne noodles, and it came out perfectly.  The only other changes I made were to add a small package of thinly sliced, baby bella mushrooms, and I sauteed the onions, garlic, and mushrooms in 1/3 cup white wine.  This is the *only* vegetarian dish my husband will eat.

This was different and delicious altho, I might add that I'm not a pasta person so take this as a huge compliment! (I know, very un-American of me!) My daughter Ashley and I discussed the recipe and she felt that it would be better with an alfredo sauce, given the vegies, however, being that hubster doesn't like it, we compromised on a pink sauce. I did add the Feta cheese to every layer and used a blend of Italian seasonings. A big thank you from the McLean family!!

This is wonderful!  I took others' advice and used fresh baby spinach chopped in the food processor.  I used very little of the vegetable broth and used a marinara sauce recipe from this site for the pasta sauce.  This is definitely worth the effort!

Great recipe! I ended up using garden rotini noodles because it was all I had. Also used chunky vegetable pasta sauce and it was a terrific meatless dish. Very tasty and satisfying!  Left out rosemary because I don't like it - used basil instead.  The next time I make this, I might try adding fresh mushrooms and a brick of cream cheese as suggested by another rater.

I rated this 5 stars because all five in our family really liked it, which is rare. For those who found it to have a bit too much liquid, just let it simmer longer to reduce.  This does work well with noodles that need no cooking, but bump up the number.  I cut down on the feta (due to family requests) and used more mozarella than what was called for.  It was a good call . . .the more cheese the better I say!  Definite repeat!
I MUST add that it is SO nice to use frozen chopped spinach in a recipe and NOT be required to squeeze it dry!

I'm a novice cook and took this to a potluck last night - it was the HIT of the party! I used other reviewers' suggestions - no-cook noodles, 1/2 the amount of broth, 2/3 the amount of pasta sauce, dollops of ricotta along with the mozzarella layers. I think next time I'll use even less broth and sauce and try to make it thicker. All around awesome flavors and presentation!

I made this for Christmas dinner, and we loved it. I was out of broth (forgot to pick some up), but I remembered that some of the reviews suggested reducing it, so I siphoned off about a cup from the garbanzos with fennel (also from this site) I'd made the night before, and the consistency was just right. I used homemade marinara "imported" from our favorite Jersey deli, no-boil noodles, 2 cans of unmarinated artichokes, and 8 oz of fresh spinach. This was one of the easiest, quickest lasagnas I've made, and the flavor was excellent. I'll definitely be making this again, and not just for special occasions.

I have made this several times and is very good.  I would not suggest using the whole can of broth because it will be too watery (use only half).  You can also add in any vegis you want.  I also also mix a 1/2 a jar of red sauce with a 1/2 a jar of white sauce to change it up a bit.

My SO and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did modify the recipe a bit using a few of the great suggestions given: 

1) I incorporated a ricotta layer as suggested by TYKE99 - ricotta cheese, 1 egg or egg substitute, mozzarella cheese, fresh parsley, and salt and pepper.  Doing that gave the dish an extra dimension. 
2) I do not like rosemary, so I used basil instead.  
3) I do not like my dish oily and eat vinegary tasting artichokes, so I used artichoke canned in water instead.  
4) I reduced the veggie broth to half, since a lot of reviewers said the dish was a little watery.  
5) Since I did not find no-cook lasagna noodles at my local supermarket, and I was afraid my unboiled lasagna noodles might come out raw, I half cooked them.  The lasagna noodles came out perfect!
6) Using 3 lasagna noodles did not entirely cover my 9X13 inch baking dish, so I used 4.
7) FINALLY... I used parmesan cheese for the topping, since I did not find herb and garlic feta at my local supermarket.  It gave the dish a nice crust when I broiled the top.   

Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was very good. One thing I like to suggest to those who want to sub the tomato based sauce for alfredo, I'd like to politely suggest not to do this, mainly because I know where you are coming from. I was brought up on very creamy, rich and high fat foods and found it hard to try things that were not. But really, if you try it as is it is sooo good and just profoundly healthier for you and your family. Especially if you can also use a lower fat cheese.

This was tasty and not at all soggy.  I let the liquid cook off and added the broth/garlic/onion combo to my spinach and artichoke mixture (I pureed the artichoke).  Added the sauce and thought it didn't look or smell very good as a finished product, but was actually quite tasty when cooked.  The artichoke added good flavor.

Don't waste time pre-cooking the noodles, there's plenty of liquid to cook them while it's baking. It was really good, but I'm not giving it 5 stars b/c it needs something with more substance - maybe mushrooms??

A very good lasagna recipe; one I will definitely make again.  I added 16oz of low fat ricotta since I love ricotta, but I'm certain this dish would still be good without it.  I made this the day before and let it sit uncooked overnight in the refrigerator.  I also did not cook the noodles beforehand and baked it covered with foil for 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect.  This was very good, but every few bites I was reminded of that yucky canned ravioli I ate as a child.  It took me a few bites to realize that it was the larger chunks of artichokes that had that flavor.  I don't use canned food often, so maybe I’m just not use to that 'canned' flavor.  In the future, I will use artichokes from a jar or omit them all together.

This was Amazing!  I served this at a special dinner party and everyone was amazed at the unique idea of adding feta and artichokes to Lasagna.  I also substiuted the feta for a Kraft Mediteranean (feta/mozzerela) blend and would do it again in a heart beat.

What a fabulous find! My husband and boss loved it and went back for seconds. You don't have to be a vegetarian to love this dish.

After reviewing other comments about too much moisture, I squeezed out the spinach until it looked like a baseball. I did the same to the artichoke after chopping it. I used exact broth, and the result was a beautiful dish that held it's shape on the plate.

This was THE best lasagna ever! I don't know why but it is! So glad I made it. My usual meat'lovin hubbie said it was the best lasagna he ever ate. This will be a staple...so easy and no need to pre-cook the noodles. I will be making this again this weekend for a party! Thanks for sharing.

I have made this lasagna again and again, and I always receive wonderful reviews.  A big Italian-cooking fan friend of mine says it is the best lasagna he's ever had!  I've doubled the spinach and artichokes, which packs it with more veggies and still works great. I've also added ricotta cheese, mixed in with some parmesan, and done alternating cheese layers similar to traditional lasagna, with feta still on the top.  Awesome!

Delicous, extremely aromatic, full of flavor. I'll definitely make this one again when we have guests (or when we don't... ) Adendum: We made it when we had BOTH sets of parents over for Mother's day; quite a success.

I had to omit the feta even though I love it.  My family is not as open minded.  I also used Alfredo sauce instead of tomato.  It was divine!  My guest loved it also.

Fantastic recipe! I did use 10 ounce fresh spinach and added cottage cheese over the uncooked noodles. Everyone at work asked me for the recipe. Thanks to whoever posted this. My husband loved it,too, even without meat in it!

Delicious, nutritious and super easy. The lasagna was actually ready to be assembled by the time the noodles were finished cooking. I used prechopped garlic. I also used dried rosemary in place of fresh, and I used two packages of fat free mozzarella cheese (4 cups, not 3 as the recipe calls for). This recipe is easy and when using fat free mozzarella cheese, it's incredibly low in fat. Yummy!

This is a great recipe!  I made the following changes: regular, canned artichoke hearts instead of the marinated kind, cut the broth down to 1/2 cup, and used uncooked noodles (cooked the lasagna at 450 degrees for 50 minutes to cook the noodles).  I will be making this again!

This is an absolutely wonderful lasagna! I made it for the third time last night. I also do not pre-cook my lasagna noodles and they are perfect after the dish has been baked. I used fresh baby leaf spinich instead of frozen and non-marinated artichoke hearts and probably twice the cheese (we're cheese fanatics). I'm going to try to make one ahead of time and freeze it for later to see how that works out. Thanks for the great recipe!

This lasagna was delicious.  I did make a few changes.  I used a can of regular artichokes (not marinated) because I'm just not fond of that vinegar taste in recipes.  I added another 1/2 jar of sauce (I used Classico Spicy Red Pepper as recommneded), sauted mushrooms in with the onions and garlic, and added ricotta.  I used a 15 oz container with one egg, S & P, parsley and garlic salt.  I think I actually used 4 cups of mozzarella (I topped with mozz instead of feta.  I used basil instead of rosemary, and I used the Barilla no-bake noodles.  With all of my changes (I know it seems like a lot) it probably tasted very similar to the original.  It was so delicious - the flavor was just perfect.  The only problem was that it was really runny.  I couldn't wait the 10 minutes to let it set (too hungry and it looked too good), so it was a soupy mess.  Looked pretty until I cut it, but we didn't care - it was just family and everyone (including the children) really enjoyed it.  My dilemma is that I was testing this out for a big dinner (80 people) and I won't have time to try it again.  I'm thinking I will just reduce the broth to 1/2 cup per lasagna, and then even let it boil without the lid.  We are going to pre-bake and re-heat the next day, so hopefully that will work.  If anyone has advice on how to do this, please write in.  This was a keeper - my husband said it was better than my usual veggie lasagna.

Very good flavor. I added fresh crimini mushrooms when cooking the onions. I also added a 24 oz container of cottage cheese on top of the mozzarella layer and I used no-boil noodles. The end result was very runny and the broth could be cut to 1 cup and still have plenty of liquid. I could only find 26 oz. jars of sauce.

I used oven-ready lasagna noodles and it turned out perfect. I only used one 28 oz. jar of sauce (per instructions) and it definitely did NOT need more sauce! As others suggested I added dollops of ricotta after the mozzarella layer. Despite the hour+ prep time and cost of ingredients, this recipe is a keeper since it tastes so good.

I made this for my artichoke-mad husband although I didn't expect to care for it myself.  It is really, really good.  I had homemade pasta sauce (used 5 cups) and chicken broth on hand and as they were both full of garlic & onion I didn't include what was called for in the recipe.  I was worried about the amount of broth called for but it was quickly absorbed by the vegetables.  I topped the dish with plain feta but I think it would also be fine without.  This baked perfectly and wasn't watery, which to me is the mark of a great lasagna recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

This is very good.  I gave a piece of it to a co-worker for lunch, and she said it was delicious.  I'm not sure about the artichokes, but I think that is a personal issue, and not reflective of the dish.    I didn't use marinated artichokes.  Definitely use more than one bottle of sauce.  I used about 3/4 of a jar of Classico Spicy Red Pepper (one reviewer's suggestion) and 3/4 jar of Classico Sun Dried Tomato, but it could have used a whole two jars.  Next time I will try adding ricotta cheese, as several other reviewers have done.

This is one of my favorite dishes, and I don't like traditional lasagna all that much. It came out a little soupy the first time i made it, so i only used about 3/4 can of the vegetable broth next time.  Chicken broth also works well - for those non-vegetarians out there.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I feel like the black sheep!  I can't believe all the great reviews about this dish.  The feta didn't taste that great with this dish, also the pasta sauce I used probably changed the whole taste (bell pepper & mushroom).  
But the best lasagna on this site is Creamy Chicken Lasagna!!!

OHMYGOSH!  I do not like spinach, I do not like artichokes, but I LOVED this recipe.  My husband is vegetarian, so I made it for him, but I wound up eating the most!  I did twist it a little by adding soy meat and sauteed mushrooms for added protein.  My mouth waters just thinking about it!  Thank you and I will pass this on for years to come:)

Very good. I doubled the spinach, garlic, and onions.  Next time I will add other chopped veggies too...love the feta.

This was awesome!!!  My husband and I both like it better than any lasagna we've had.  (with or without meat!)  My one year old loved it too.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that's all I had.  I also put it in 2 8x8" pans and froze one for later.  YUMMY!  I can't wait to take that one out of the freezer next week!

This is an absolutely awesome dish!  It's easy to prepare, and delicious.  It's a great alternative to traditional lasanga.  My dad, who is the pickiest non-vegetarian in the world (he refuses to try tofu even), loved it.  He said that I could make that any time I wanted.  One suggestion from me is to use fresh spinach - it's less of a hassle to deal with than defrosting of the frozen spinach.

This was a huge hit with my friends - both vegetarians and carnivores.  Extremely tasty and had a slight zing to it.  It did take me a little longer than 20 min prep time.....I would allow an hour prep time to be on the safe side.  It was soooooooooooooooooooo good and totally worth it.

A taste of the Mediterranean!  
It is different from the same ol'-same ol' lasagna and very tasty!
We have made it only one time so far and used alfredo sauce.  Love the rosemary and feta flavors!

This was very good! The marinated artichokes really added a nice flavor. Added sauted mushrooms, which I thought was nice addition. Did not cover sauce while cooking & let it cook down a little so no problems with being watery. (Also left pan in oven for extra time) Used chiken broth, since could not find vegetable. My husband thought this was great. Good leftovers. Will make this again!

After all the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed.  I think it's because I found out I didn't really like marinated artichokes.  I also made it with red sacue, as the recipe called for instead of a white sauce like some people suggested.  I think that the spinace flavor might have gone better with a white sauce.

This recipe is GREAT for vegetarians.  It is soo tasty.  Instead of using plain lasagna noodles, I substituted whole wheat noodles which gave it a denser texture.  I also used extra feta.  It was great even as leftovers!

Wow! I'm a vegetarian and my fiance is not, but we both love this lasagna.  Try using fresh spinach lightly cooked with some butter and garlic instead of the frozen.

I've had people tell me they had a second child just so I'd make them another pan of "my lasagne." I gave this recipe 4 stars because, as written, it comes out a little thin on two counts: first, it's watery; second (more important), it just doesn't have as much filling as I'd like. So, I doubled everything except the noodles and the chicken stock. After adding the sauce I simmer it for a long time (up to an hour, depending on the sauce I use) to make sure there's no wateriness to the sauce at all. The only other change I make is to broil it for about 5 minutes at the end so some of the cheese gets brown and crusty.

Definitely will make again! This is a lasagna that carvivores should love! Satisfying and filling, too.  I used  Italian sausage pasta sauce (it's all I had), and I added sliced black olives. But the recipe as is---it's amazing. I used no-bake lasagna noodles (which I don't usually like), but they worked out great. Next time I make this, I will try to make it more plant-based.

This was one of the best lasagnas I have ever had! I am so sorry for those of you who didn’t like this or who liked it but had issues. The only changes I made were to use fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. So there’s that little bit of extra effort to have to chop it all up. And I did take the advice of those who said not to boil the noodles first. In fact, I don’t think I’m ever going to boil lasagna noodles again! The noodles came out perfect! No sogginess, mushiness, limpness. Don’t be afraid of the liquid. I was. The whole time I was assembling I was so dubious. I was positive it would be awful. At the end there is still a little bit of liquid but nothing major. The tastes are delicious, the noodles are perfect. And it leaves it open to add things. The next time I want to add things like mushrooms, carrots, black olives. You could add meat if you’re a carnivore! But definitely try this recipe before you poo poo it! And really, this all comes together quickly. I poured myself some wine, put in some music, assembled the dish. Lovely!

This was a big hit.  Spouse ate half of the lasagne all by himself.  I wound up adding some ricotta, because it's lasagne, and due to some technical difficulties I had to cook the thing in the Big Green Egg.  The cheeses picked up a lot of the smoke, which gave it an amazing flavor I couldn't have gotten indoors.  (Not without setting off the alarms and scaring the pets, anyway.)

The artichokes make this recipe.  I doubled both the artichokes and spinach, then cooked the broth down to less than half.  I added a 16oz container of cottage cheese mixed with 1 cup of mozzarella and one egg.  I layered veggies, tomato sauce, dabs of cottage cheese mixture, precooked lasagna noodles, and so forth.

I added palm hearts and used chicken broth, fresh basil, oregano and rosemary. Due to a tomato allergy I used alfredo sauce and fresh spinach. Also I took a chance from another review and did not precook my lasagna noodles and voila I didn't need to:) saved me a step and some time. This recipe was delicious:)

Made this for dinner tonight -- definitely will make it again -- delicious!!!  The only "changes" I made (if you could call them that) was to use an 8 oz bag of fresh spinach (which I chopped) and I didn't cook my noodles -- just used regular old noodles but didn't cook them first.  Mine was not too runny… I think using raw noodles makes a difference.  The jar of pasta sauce I used was Ragu with garlic and onion… it's a great "base" sauce for a lot of things.

It's yummy but much too watery as is.  I leave out the broth and use a big bag of spinach.  It makes enough liquid and the texture is perfect.  I also add a layer of Ricotta mixed with an egg and grated parmesan & mozzarella with chopped parsley, salt & pepper.

THE BEST lasagna I have ever had! And I used fake cheese!

Adjustments:

-Used no cook lasagna noodles. This really helps with the moisture and is less work!
-Used "fake cheese" because we eat too much cheese (though I'm sure equally delicious with the real thing)
-Doubled the amount of spinach

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I double the recipe for a 9x13 pan or use a smaller pan for a single recipe.

I cut the broth in about half as others suggested.  I think it turned out delicious! Great recipe!

The only things I did differently was to add a small container of ricotta because it was about to expire.  After some of the reviews, I did cook the spinach/artichoke mixture down more so it wasn't so wet. It was a nice alternativ. Served with Simple and Delicious Beet Greens and Roasted Romanesco, Broccoli, and Cailiflower.

Loved this recipe. I followed the directions with only a couple changes: I added 2 chopped jalapenos (I love spicy lasagna) and a package of chopped fresh mushrooms when I added the spinach and artichoke hearts. I also used fresh spinach, only used one cup of broth, and used ready to cook lasagna noodles which. Came out perfect! Quick, healthy, and cheap... My kinda meal! ;)

This was great. I put the feta in between the layers of noodles and mozzarella and next time I might use Ricotta instead. I used no-cook noodles. I also thought the rosemary was a little bit strong so next time I would use less.

Made it just as directed, except we used a little less rosemary because it's not my favorite.  My husband ate more than half my himself over the course of 2 days and my 2-year-old couldn't shovel it in her mouth fast enough!  So great!

I loved the taste of this recipe and did not find it to be a lot of work.  The only downfall is the calorie content.  At nearly 500 calories per serving it was not the healthy dinner I was hoping it to be.

I really like this recipe- it's a great alternative to the standard pasta with tomato sauce - The ingredients blend wonderfully - I used bowtie pasta because I didn't have lasagna noodles on hand and I used half the garlic listed (personal preference) and fresh spinach and it turned out great -the whole family loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

I did not cook the noodles beforehand, and I baked the lasagna uncovered because I didn't have anything to cover it with. It turned out a little bit dry (which I prefer to an extent so that was okay) and some people would probably want the noodles to be a little softer. It worked pretty well though. Great flavor! I also topped it with parmesan cheese instead of feta. Chopping the artichokes was a huge pain because they're so squishy and slippery...I think they might sell them pre-chopped and if so I'm definitely buying those next time...

The only substitutions I made were some fresh sweet basil and tomato basil feta. The recipe is easy, although time consuming if you are chopping by hand. Overall, I liked the taste and I'm sure I will make again.

The whole family really liked it!!  That hardly EVER happens!  I only made a couple of subtle changes.  I didn't have veg broth, so I used chicken broth.  I added lots of sliced mushrooms to onions and garlic and sauteed in olive oil.  I didn't cook the noodles.  I used the oven ready kind.  I also omitted rosemary and substituted dried basil. I couldn't find herbed feta, so I used tomato and basil feta and then sprinkled oregano over it at the end.  Sooo good!  Will add to family favorites!!

I added 1 lb of italian sausage & 1 lb of lean ground beef & it made the PERFECT lasagna. Definitely making it again. I didn't like the feta though, I would nix it the next time.

I've made this recipe many times over the past 3 years.  Everyone loves it!  I never precook my lasagna noodles; just layer them in and they cook just fine.  The fresh rosemary gives it a great flavor.  I've added mushrooms and have used different flavors of feta as well.

Good Stuff!  I added mushrooms to the mix and used fresh spinach instead.  I also did a layer of sliced kumato tomatoes, and I threw in some fresh chopped basil.  I also did a layer of ricotta, but would skip that next time and do cottage cheese instead.  It was a little too watery the first night, but the liquid soaked up the next day and I always think it tastes better the next day anyways.  This was a hit even with serious carnivores.  Will definitely make this again!

EXCELLENT - best vegetable lasagna I've ever made or had!  I took advice from other reviews and did not boil the noodles and used olive oil to saute the onions and garlic.  We were very pleased with the taste and texture, there is no doubt we will make this again and again!

Made this many times, and everyone always loves it.  I use fresh spinach (one of those plastic salad packets will suffice), and sometimes add other fresh herbs.  A version featuring white sauce, sauteed local eggplant and squash, and ricotta cheese (in addition to mozzarella) also went over well.  It's not hard, or too terribly time consuming; it just takes awhile to cook.

Fan-freaking-tastic! Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I think I prefer this as the best lasagne I have ever eaten. I used whole wheat noodles and didn't bother to boil them first (why bother with that extra step when it turns out perfect anyway?), and used 12 of them. Also used 1 c more mozzarella cheese and slightly more pasta sauce because I couldn't find the packages with the quantities required. Big hit with my whole dinner party, leftovers are already gone. :'(

Made this "pot style" by using pre-cooked mac noodles.  After adding the pasta sauce (step 3), I let this simmer for 20 mins.  Added mac noodles and some mozzarella and cotija cheeses.  Let them blend/warm and served with a bit more cheese on top.  Fantastic and so easy!

Very nice lasagna, in my opinion, and I love that it's a veggie lasagna but uses tomato sauce--most use white sauces, and while I like those okay, I prefer tomato sauce so this was great for me.  I thought the flavors went well together.  Bf, however, was unhappy  bc there was no meat.  That was his only problem with it; I asked.  ;o)  Whatever, I like this a lot so I'll eat most of it.  I didn't bother boiling the lasagna noodles; if you add about a cup of liquid to your dish, the noodles will cook while it bakes.   You do tend to have to bake a tad longer; I baked with the foil on for 45 mins, then took it off and baked another 15 and it was perfectly cooked.   Instead of adding water, I added in a can of diced tomatoes with the juice and that worked perfectly, but you can use water if you prefer.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this lasagna!  I made some modifications.  I only used 8 oz broth, added portobello mushrooms, used fresh spinach, and did not pre-cook the noodles.  I also used one jar Classico's roasted garlic alfredo sauce instead of red sauce.  The dish was not runny, it did over flow the 11x7 I used.

Very good recipe! I followed the advice of others and went easy on the broth so that the lasagna would not come out to watery. I also used beef broth instead of vegetable just because I already had it but it came out great! My meat loving make members of the family even said that would like it again!

THE BEST Lasagna I ever made. Like most people I made "some" changes such as using Imported Italian Parmessan and Romano cheeses for the "topping" instead of Feta. 
I also added 16 oz. fresh mushrooms (cleaned and sliced)  and Two Zuchhini quartered and sliced in 1/4 chunks.
DELICIOUS!! 
BEST I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!

Love this recipe! Next time I will add chicken for sure and drain out more of the liquid before layering the artichoke/sauce part into the lasagna. I also use whole wheat noodles and low-fat cheese. A wonderful, healthy meal!

Delicious!  Since I have turned vegetarian I have decided to start cooking some of my own meals.  This is the first recipe I've tried and the first meal I have ever baked.  Not too difficult for a beginner, save for obvious beginner mistakes (underestimated prep time, cooked noodles too soon).  However this still came out to become one of my favorite dishes ever.  My non-vegetarian sister loves it too!  Tastes great with thyme and basil on top, and went well with a side of potatoes in rosemary-butter sauce.

Very very good! Made almost exactly as is except I used no boil noodles, doubled the pasta sauce, artichokes, and spinach and I added mushrooms.  Husband loved it too! Will make often.

I use Vons Select Artichoke Pasta Sauce and add a layer of ricotta, egg, and basil mixture.  Always gets rave reviews.  I also don't pre cook the noodles.

It doesn't really need another 5 star review, but here's one anyway. My 12 and 8 year old and meat loving husband as well as myself all loved this recipe. I did add ricotta to the layers and will be putting this into our regular dinner rotation schedule! Thanks for sharing!  =D

This is the BEST lasagna I have ever had. I made this a few nights ago. As with some of the others, I didn't cook the noodles before I put them in- and I found them to be the PERFECT texture once baked. I added a bit more tom sauce and veg broth to the sauce to make it a bit more runny. But it turned out to be the perfect consistency once baked. I also used old cheddar cheese in between layers. This was a HIT in my house, and I know I will be making this again- quite soon in fact!

Absolutely delicious.  I used the feta cheese on each level, and it really added a lot to the textures of the dish.  I also added salt and pepper to the spinach and artichokes, and next time I will probably add some oregano/extra spice to them as well.  Overall a fantastic dish!!!

This was delicious!  I added a bit of cream cheese to jarred marinara & crushed tomatoes to make a pink sauce, and I added ricotta in with the mozzarella & egg for firmer cheese layers.  I omitted the rosemary & used fresh basil & baby spinach.  It was a hit!  My kids even cleaned their plates; and a foodie friend said that 'if she had ordered this somewhere, she'd be 100% pleased'  This will definitely go into a regular rotation at our house!

This was really good. I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of not precooking the noodles. The only reason it wasn't 5 stars for me is that it felt a little like it need something more....more  veggies or something to make it more substantial and it's flavor is very dependent on the jarred sauce you choose. I loved the addition of the package of herb and garlic feta on top. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

Yum! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Added a little pesto and black olives to the tomato pasta sauce and only used about 1/4 can of broth. Even with only using 1/4 can it still came out a little watery. I think you could probably omit that all together and it would still taste fine. Also, left out the feta (only because I forgot to buy some) and it still tasted good. Will make again!

I halved my recipe, didn't precook my noodles since most reviewers said it was runny. I also added fresh spinach and swiss chard to my recipe. This was a yummy take on a meatless lasagna. Thanks for sharing.

I picked out this recipe to get more magnesium in my diet, nothing to do with wanting a vegetarian meal, so I cooked up a pound of hot Italian sausage with the onions and garlic before stirring in the rest. I left out the broth entirely (and definitely didn't need it), and used unmarinated artichokes, then alternated layers with mozzarella and ricotta cheeses (it took 12 noodles). Since everything was cooked already, I only put the lasagna in the oven for 30 minutes.  It was delicious with fresh bread broiled with butter, parmesan-romano and garlic powder.

Very good!  I added a ton more veggies and omitted the rosemary (but only because I didn't have any).  As a meat-lover, going without the ground beef seemed depressing but the artichokes really do a great job of replacing my preferred form of protein.  Next time, I'll make it with the "Easy Italian Chicken" recipe found on this site.

This was pretty darn good! I love artichoke, and I love spinach, so naturally I love them combined!

My husband liked it and I thought it was good, but there seems to be something missing, not sure what...I may have to improvise and add some ricotta or something.  I think it's a good start for me to experiment with the idea of veggie lasagna since I am a huge meat eater.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't change a thing and had great success.  I used Safeway brand pasta sauce (onion/garlic flavor).  Made 12 servings at about $1.75 per serving.

I have made this wonderful dish twice now, and have had amazing compliments on it,  each time I was asked for the recipe. It is delicious. I did substitute the feta cheese for goat cheese. But its a fantastic recipe. Thank you so much :)

This was great. I used 3/4 of the broth and it wasn't too watery at all.  My hubby loved it as well. I will make this again for sure.

This was very good. Drained the artichokes and reserved the liquid.  Added vegetable broth to make 14oz. Used 2 pkgs. frozen spinach and the no-boil noodles. Did not use the feta cheese and cut up the artichokes. Baked as directed. Will make this again!

This is wonderful, and I do not eat spinach. I made this the first time following the directions, this time I'm adding cottage cheese, nice sub for ricotta, and using a vodka sauce, it should be wonderful. My husband raves about this dish. I pair it with a cream cheese and herb biscuit. Add a glass of Chardonnay and you can call it gourmet.

Every body loved this dish.  I think really the only trick you have to do with this dish is not cook the noodles first.  Because of how watery the sauce is it will cook the noodles while baking and help make the sauce more consistent.  That was the only thing I changed and it came out great.  Set aside getting rid of onions and adding more garlic but that's just because my girlfriend hates onions.

Fantastic lasagna!  We've made it 3 times in the past 3 weeks.  We were using regular feta with tomato and basil until we found this actual type of feta for our most recent batch.  We actually preferred the other kind.  It was a little less salty.  Super, super yummy though!! :)

I tweaked the recipe and used Garlic Alfredo pasta sauce instead of tomato pasta sauce and also used fresh spinach. I thought the dish could use some meat so I added little over a pound of chicken breast (seasoned with basil, parsley, thyme, garlic salt, and rosemary) -cubed and then cooked- to the artichoke/spinach mixture (while simmering). Made this dish for Valentine's day dinner for my boyfriend and his roommate and they devoured it. Will make again!

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did make a few changes (doesn't everyone?)  I added a lb. of sweet italian sausages and browned it with the onion and garlic.  I didn't boil the noodles and all but the top noodles were soft by the time I finished cooking.  I will soak the top layer noodles in hot water next time.  Changed the spices a little -- a Tbsp of basil, oregano and 1/2 tbsp of fennel seeds added at the simmering stage.  The amount of cheese was perfect.  Thanks for submitting this yummy recipe.

Used whole wheat pasta, reduced fat cheese, and 1/2 of broth (i used chicken because no vegetable broth on hand). It was tasty. Next time I think I'll add Basil and use fresh spinach.  Will be making this again.

This was very good.  I like my artichokes chopped finely, as well as the spinach.  I think it could have used a tad more sauce.  The leftovers were a little dry.  But overall, my husband LOVED the dish.  Just because no meat, doesn't mean it isn't filling! IT IS!  Great with salad & bread.

This was really good and a nice change from the typical red sauce lasagna. I cut a lot of the ingredients though based off my own taste and added extra garlic, spices, etc to my taste.

I was inspired by this recipe and made an easier version. I used al dente cooked penne, that I tossed with the artichoke and spinach filling as well as some drained, chopped tomatoes. I added a few spoonfuls of ricotta to the casserole (I didn't bother mixing them in), some cracked pepper, and shredded mozzarella on top. I also beat two eggs and poured them in to bind the casserole. Baked with some grated parmigiano on top, it came together beautifully.  Thanks for the inspiration! Next time I'll add mushrooms and matchstick carrots for color.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I changed a couple things though.  I used no boil noodles so they would not turn out soggy.  Also this cuts down on time.  Instead of red sauce I used a white sauce or alfredo. I also added ricotta in between a layer.  Wonderful!

I think the spinich is overpowering in the recipe and could have more cheese or something else. I didn't care for the rosemary either. It was ok, but you really need to like spinich and artichoke. My husband wasn't a fan.

I'm a vegetarian and I often make this for my non-veg friends because it doesn't leave them with that 'incomplete' feeling they sometimes get when you serve meat-free food. Hearty and delicious. I've made this several times and will make again.

This recipe was terrific!  I used uncooked noodles and did not parboil them.  When the lasagna was done I let it sit for half an hour before cutting, which allowed suitable time for settling of the juices.  It cut perfectly and was not watery at all!

The is a great recipe!!!! I did modify it a bit to suit my taste, but I think that's what's so great about it. I used regular whole wheat noodles but did not cook them prior to layering in the pan and it came out perfect. I also used fresh baby spinach and didn't drain the artichokes. I added some chopped baby portobello mushrooms to give it more of a "meaty" texture. And reduced the veggie broth to 12 oz and used a 32 oz jar of sauce.  I think I might try an alfredo sauce next time. But this was fantastic. Thanks for sharing!

This was a tasty base recipe.  I made a few changes but did not change the integrity of the recipe.   I used 14 oz of diced tomatoes and 14 oz of pasta sauce.  I also included some fresh basil and sauteed mushrooms.  It wasn't overly juicy.  10 minutes is definitely enough time to set the lasagna.

For being vegetarian, it was excellent! My husband complained that it missed meat, and I found myself not craving a second helping(my true test of a great recipe) Although I can't say what it needed, so maybe it just wasn't my thing.

INCREDIBLE. That's all that can be said for this dish. We used no cook noodles, and fresh basil, as well as fresh spinach and zucchini. The only thing I would do is maybe add some more veggies and sauce. :) Thanks so much for this recipe...I will be making this again and again. My boyfriend said it's been one of his favorite dishes, and I cook something new 3-4 times a week...well done D!

Just made this for the second time because my friends kept asking for it. I used no cook noodles, fresh basil instead of rosemary, italian cheese blend for the mozzarella, and added chicken breast. WOW!

A no meat lasagna? This Sicilian would usually say, "No Way!" But this recipe is amazing.  We've tested this out on a lot of friends, and have had nothing but rave reviews. This has passed the vegetarian test, and a meat lover said, "If you didn't tell me there wasn't any meat in this, I wouldn't have known."  I altered the recipe a bit and added more garlic, just because I always do that. I used no-bake noodles, because why wouldn't you - saves so much time and still tastes great. I used about 12 ounces of the vegetable broth and left the lid off - both of these things will keep the mixture from being soupy.  Other than that, I stick to the rest of the recipe.  Perfect alternative to a meat lasagna, and just as hearty. Other veggie lasagnas fail miserably, but not this one.  Thanks DMCCRACKEN for a rockin' recipe!

This was very good! A lot better than I expected it to be. I am not a huge fan of vegetarian meals, but I really thought this had good substance without meat. I made half of it with ground beef for my boyfriend. Next time I think I will try it with alfredo sauce, and maybe grilled chicken.

This recipe was amazing! I added chopped carrots and mushrooms to the garlic and onions, used less mozarella (didn't have enough), and used plain goat cheese instead of feta (personal taste). I also added a little bit of sour cream to the sauce to make it creamy. Did not precook the noodles. It was slightly watery so I will probably reduce the broth just a bit next time. Oh, I also sprinkled the top with the fresh rosemary because I forgot to add it to the sauce. Great recipe!

I made this along with a meat lasagna for my dad's 60th birthday party.  There were 8 adults and two kids, two of us vegetarian.  I only had one piece of this vegetarian lasagne left at the end of the night! And that was after appetizers. The only major thing I remember doing different was to use home made marinara instead of jarred. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum! Gotta use feta on this one--it really compliments the other flavors quite well. COuple things I changed based on what I had on hand: fresh basil in place of rosemary, chicken stock in place of veg., added shredded meat of one cooked chicken breast, and a variety of cheeses. Super easy to put together--like most lasagnas, tends to be better reheated, in my opinion. =)

I brought this to work for an Earth Day potluck and everyone loved it!  I used ricotta instead of feta (I added most of it into the sauce and put some on top), I used 1/2 the broth and and no-bake noodles but other than that, I kept everything the same.  Delicious!

Amazing flavor. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried. I also didn't have marinated artichokes, so I made my own. (See below for recipe.) Well worth the extra step. Used chicken broth and no-boil noodles. (Can't wait for my husband to try this.)  1 bag of Frozen artichoke hearts prepared according to the package directions 1 cup each wine vinegar and olive oil (*virgin, not extra virgin) 4 cloves fresh garlic, minced  3 tablespoons minced fresh Italian parsley  Mix together wine vinegar, oil, garlic powder and parsley. Add artichokes. Stir, cover and refrigerate. Better on the second day. Will keep several weeks in the refrigerator; stir occasionally. Makes 24 whole chokes.  *Extra virgin olive oil may become too dominate in flavor so virgin olive oil is preferred.

I've been making this recipe for years now and am just not writing a fantastic review for it! This is the 'go to' when making dinner with friends. Fun and easy and so very delicious. The only take away: make sure the spinach is thawed and drained completely or it will make the lasagna soupy. Cheers!

This recipe is super tasty.  I have made this several times (after about my 6th time I'm moving the star count up!).  It is a staple at my house.  I have done the half red half alfredo sauce and my personal fave is the sun dried tomato alfredo sauce.  I've also made it with fresh spinach, no bake noodles, etc to save time and it turns out just as well.  Everyone that has had this has absolutely raves about it.  The only advice is chop up the artichokes well enough or the loose leaves can burn.  As another reviewer mentioned, the left over are fantastic.  I've actually been told they are better after they have had a day to sit.  Perhaps making the lasagna the night before and baking it the day off would be a way to get that "next day flavor" from freshly cooked lasagna (beware:  I have not tried that yet, just an idea).

This was fantastic - the best recipe I've found on this site.  I did add red pepper and might try mushrooms next time. I also didn't use the full amount of cheese, but it was still superb.

UNREAL.  Everyone loved this.  I (of course) made some changes.  I added 1/2 of the broth called for and did not boil my noodles.  I also added 1 can black olives and a layer of riccota cheese.  I doubled the recipe and then tried to jam it into a 9x13 cause i wanted a super thick lasagna.... bad idea, i ended up making the 9x13 and a 9 x9.  Leftovers were no problem!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it... its was worth the work.

I didn’t love this, and I’m confused why it’s so highly rated.  Thought I did something wrong, but others shared my issues in the reviews I read.  At a party I threw, my guests said it was very good, but the other dishes I made vanished, while this was the one I had most of left.  I boiled the noodles for half the recommended time on the box (about 6-8 minutes), and those actually came out quite nicely.  I added extra cheese and a ricotta layer, and that also worked out well.  But I didn’t have enough sauce, and I only ended up using 6 noodles instead of the 9.  And I thought the sauce came out watery even though I only used 1 cup of the veggie broth.  I thought the whole dish was rather bland and boring.  I look forward to seeing more reviews on how to liven this up.  I think I’ll try the alfredo sauce next time for a little added thickness, and perhaps even less broth.  This time I uhad sed Classico Triple Mushroom Pasta Sauce, which I thought was good, but didn’t stand up to the liquid.  I plan to try again, but so far, not impressed and a little confused about the high ratings.

This was a pleasent change from normal lasagna, we used marinated artichoke hearts which added a strange taste, however it was easy to pick out which is why I didn't vote lower because that was our goof up.

This was pretty good. I added eggplant to the vegetable mixture. That may have been the reason that it did not have quite as much sauce as I would have liked.

This recipe was surprisingly good. I didn't think all the flavors would come together so well, but they did. Also, it had a nice consistency and was not too soupy. I used no-bake lasagna noodles and a little less (about 10 oz. instead of 14 oz.) broth. I also used alfredo sauce at the advice of other reviewers. I added some mashed up cannellini beans to give it some fiber. Turned out surprisingly good.

This is an awesome dish. However, definitely don't go into it thinking "italian tomato-based lasagna". It has several strong flavors that are good together, but they ARE strong flavors.

This is the best spinach lasagna I have ever had.  My wife and son just loved it.  I also took two big helpings, hot from the oven, over to the Obama campaign HQ here in town to two wonderful young campaign workers from Hawaii and California who hadn't had home cooking for months.  They were tickled to see metal utensils!  And they loved the lasagna!  The californai "girl" is a vegetarian and she just raved!  Served it with a fresh romaine salad, and a nice glass of fresh locally made apple cider.

This was great, I did use alfredo sauce, just because it sounded like it might be better with the rest of the ingredients, but I would like to try using red sauce next time.

This was a GREAT recipe!  I read the others that said it was watery, so I used uncooked noodles, and it was perfect!! Everyone loved it, and it was quick and easy.  Thanks for submitting it!!

Little bit on the boring side. I added portabello mushrooms and olives.  The olives definitely were a welcome addition.

This recipe is just a great new twist on lasagna.  The rosemary is inspired and divine!  I added red pepper and black olives just to get a few more veggies.  The is a great recipe and will make it again soon.

This was delicious! It is very flat compared to traditional lasagnas, so the presentation is not as impressive, but I still thought it was amazing and would definitely make it again.

My family loved this lasagna variation. I shortened the prep time by using the no-cook lasagna noodles, used beef broth instead of the vegetable broth, a three cheese mozzarella pizza blend and used goat cheese instead of feta. Instead of putting the goat cheese on top, I divided it between two of the layers and finished with the pizza cheese blend. The goat cheese really made this unique. Will definitely make again.

I made it exactly as is except I substituted chicken broth for the veggie and basil and oregano for the rosemary.  I think it could have had a little bit more flavors, maybe some black pepper or red bell pepper but overall it was delicious.

This recipe is a wonderful base recipe to follow. I, like many of the other reviewers changed a few things. I sauteed some onion, garlic, and bell pepper in olive oil then added my sauce, artichoke hearts, and spinach. I left out the broth completely, used oven ready noodles, 2 cups mozzarella cheese and 1 cup romano. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the outcome, the feta topper is awesome.

Made various changes to the recipe. Added ricotta cheese, placed the feta cheese in the middle layer(to avoid dryness up top), and a few others. Would definitely make again, maybe adding another vegetable or using a white sauce.

Thought this was an excellent vegetarian lasagna.  I substituted fresh spinach for frozen and artichoke hearts packed in water for marinated.  Whole wheat noodles were used instead of regular.  As well, I used a combo of dry curd cottage cheese with part-skim mozzarella and skipped the feta.  Next time I would cut down on the vegetable broth by about a quarter cup as it was a bit watery.  But everyone loved the recipe and I will make again.

This was really good - a nice change from the traditional. I used fresh spinach...I took the advice from others and only used enough veg broth to accomodate the spinach (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup). I also didn't have fresh herbs, so I added a tsp of dried basil. Fresh is probably better, but this still turned out great. My husband said he could have ate the whole pan!

Turned out pretty well. Don't care for the feta cheese, didn't seem to go with the Italian flavors. Added ricotta cheese, used no-boil lasagna noodles, and used a 26oz jar of sauce instead of 28oz but it stll came out runnier than I'd like. Next time I'll replace some of the sauce with tomato paste.

This is simply wonderful!  I, too, added a ricotta layer with some fresh basil and parsley.  I used the big, flat no-boil lasagne noodles and used a little extra spaghetti sauce to compensate for the dry noodles.  I used fresh spinach, extra garlic and a mix of mozzarella and provolone.  This was quick, easy and very savory.  I would fix this as a "company" dish--it's that delicious (and seemingly foolproof).

Yum! This is super delicious.  The only thing I did different was I used butter and olive oil to cook the onions and garlic not cooking spray.  Next time i think I'll throw in some squash.  Delicious!

I made several changes to reduce the calorie and fat content of this lasagna and it turned out good but not great but I think that's because I ended up not liking the herbed feta.  I think next time I try it, I will use regular feta because I like the thought of the feta.  I used whole wheat pasta, 1/2 of the vegetable broth, bottle of garlic pasta sauce, artichokes that were not marinated, 2 cups fat free mozz cheese and 1 cup of skim mozz cheese.  I also added tofu so I could have the protein.  I also make this mistake every time and next time i'll remember to start with the layer of pasta and not the mixture because i never have enough to top the lasagna with the mixture.  I don't know if that happens to anyone else but it always happens to me when i'm making lasagna.  I'll definitely make it again with some minor modifications.

wow- this lasagna is incredible! an easy to follow recipe that turns out scrumptious. we tweaked the recipe a bit for our personal preferences. we used almost two bags of fresh baby spinach, added some zucchini and baby bella 'shrooms. we also made our own sauce because we had a lot of tomatoes on hand. used basil instead of rosemary and used very little of the veggie broth. comfort food at it's best.

This was a wonderful vegetarian dish. My boyfriend and I added zucchini and portabella mushrooms and after having read a few reviews added a layer of ricotta cheese (with egg and Italian herbs mixed in). The only thing that I would recommend altering is the amount of liquids used. We strained nearly everything but because of the broth we were left with a great lasagna but almost a soup at the bottom of the pan, I would merely say to cut back on the amount of broth used. Other than that it was superb!

Ever since a friend made this for me years ago, I've rolled it out for a plethora of occasions.  It is always VERY well received.  I think my favorite twist is the use of rosemary.  Excellent recipe!

this was just okay. i made it twice, once with rosemary, which was awful to my tastebuds, and once without. i really wasn't anything special. and i love spinach and artichokes. it was quite runny, although i did cut back the veg stock and used no-cook noodles.

absolutely delicious. i used goat cheese instead of feta and the flavor was just the perfect addition. As for the rest of the recipe, i have to say it might be perfect. Just the right amount of ingredients and all the flavors together just melt in your mouth. thanks!

Made this for my husband's poker group last night and all raved about it.  Said it was the best lasagna they ever had!  Even asked for the recipe!   Use 1/2 of the broth; basil instead of rosemary; and basil & tomato feta cheese.  Also included a layer of ricotta cheese mixture (8 oz. ricotta cheese, 1 egg, salt, pepper & basil to taste).

For the first time cooking lasagna, my husband said it was "Perfect!". I used no boiling lasagna noodles, added a layer of ricotta cheese (ricotta, egg, salt, pepper, fresh basil), a layer of white mushrooms sauteed in EVOO and red wine. I also added a spalsh of fat-free half and half to the marinara sause. I did not have feta, so I simply sprinkled the top with grated parmesan. Delisioso!

I added zucchini, green pepper and mushrooms at the first step (into the broth). I also substitued oregano for rosemary and it was awesome!!! Everyone loved it and most had seconds. I think this is one of the best lasagnas ever! I have made it again and again. Thanks.

We make this about once a month, and have had success every time, but it's kind of a finicky recipe.  We use fresh spinach, which takes a bit longer to dice up, but tastes so much better and the recipe overall isn't as runny.  Also, it is SO much easier to use the pre-cooked noodles--not only for time, but because the other ones can roll up onto themselves and make a mess.  Lastly, be sure to use the herbed feta cheese and the fresh rosemary...both really flavor the dish.

This has become a staple recipe in my house as well as for parties. I do it a little differently but I want to point out that there is nothing wrong with David's original. Not a real big fan of Rosemary, I use just a pinch or 2 and instead use 1 1/2 tblsp. of Basil. I used more cheese, and I use a cheddar mozarella mix in the middle layers. I don't boil the lasagna noodles at all, I just put them in dry. Always comes out perfect.  I used a food processor and pulse the artichokes so they come out at an even consistency. The last thing I fold in one pint of Ricotta cheese into the final sauce at the end after it cools a bit. I have to say, it comes out wonderful.

Didn't taste it myself as I made it for my girlfriend's meeting at work. Feedback from here was that they absolutely loved it.
Kudos to Allrecipes for another hit!

This was a little salty but otherwise good. I used whole wheat noodles that I layered into the pan uncooked, and added a ricotta and basil/oregano layer too.

This recipe was delicious....I added more fresh garlic, fresh spinach and mushrooms.  It was a little runny but very delicious.  I will take the advice next time to use 1/2 the can of broth.  I also used the oven ready lasgana noodles and it turned out great.  Thank you!!

This was a very tasty dish.  My husband's friend even wanted the recipe. I followed some suggestions and used the no-cook noodles, 1/2 the broth, tomato/basil feta, added ricotta and topped with black olives.

YUM! I only used 1/2 can of veg broth, but I really don't think it's needed at all. I used non-marinated artichokes and the Classico Triple Mushroom sauce from the store. Excellent lasagna, so easy to prepare also. Make sure the noodles are al dente.

Being a meat lover, and a slave to my grandmothers recipe, we tried thid veggie version during a dinner party with my vegetarian friend and it was a HUGE HIT! We all loved every bite, and I made a few adjustments for personal taste which I'll share: I used 10oz of frozen bagged spinich, and 6oz of the tomato basil feta which I had. I also added some basil (sprinkled over each layer), ricotta cheese (spread on each layer of pasta) and I used the whole wheat pasta. I decreased the broth to 1/2 can, and rolled the spinach and the artichockes in a towel and wrung them out as vigorously as I could, and my sauce was not runny in the least. This will become one of our new favorites for sure! Thanks for yet another great recipe!

Wow!!  Really this is wonderfull---I too used the "Best Marinara Sauce yet"  The Marinara sauce is excellent.  You really need to use this sauce for an overall top best flavor.  Also, as others commented with the "to much broth" well I used no boil lasagna noodles--5 star all the way!!!!!!

This is really good lasagna! First time lasagna maker here. I did read the reviews and omitted the broth. My spinach mixture seemed dicey so I actually just added a splash or two of the marinated oil from the artichokes. This made the lasagna VERY flavorful! I also subbed in some ricotta with the other cheese and omitted the feta (not a fan). But the base recipe is so easy, you can do a lot with it and it's hard to mess up.

Made primarily as printed -- and it came out great. Make sure to let it stand for at least ten minutes, so as to let some of the water evaporate out. I also added some olives and sliced sun-dried tomato to the top layer for a touch more color and flavor. Nothing too decadent, but it was simple and delicious.

I didn't like this too much, even with the suggestions (less broth, add ricotta). I think the main thing I didn't care for was the taste of the marinated artichokes... much too vinegary for me. Won't bother with this one again.

Best lasagna ever!!!  The only thing that I would change would be to replace the mozz cheese within the layers w/ a classic lasagna ricotta cheese mixture.  Still would top off w/ the mozz cheese.  Great reviews from family and it went faster then my ziti.

This dish was delicious and full of flavour. Although it was a little too runny for me and sloppy to serve. Next time, I will reduce the amount of broth and double the cheese and maybe add some ricotta in the mixture. Everyone loved it though.

This lasaqna is fantastic, even for meat lovers! My dad had seconds and thirds! The only thing I would comment on is that I don't feel like the rosemary added much, is just as good without if you don't have any on hand.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Pretty easy to make and very tasty. To lower the fat, I used fat-free feta and pasta sauce and low-fat mozzarella. The grocery didn't have vegetable broth, so I used chicken broth. I also substituted the fresh rosemary and garlic for dried versions. Still came out wonderful! We will be using this one again and again.

I thought this lasagna was great. Even more impressive, my carnivorous husband thought this recipe was GREAT!  Now that's impressive.  My only change was that I didn't precook the noodles.  I let the moisture cook them while in the oven.  My only complaint was that it was SO sloppy that it served up more like a casserole.  I think I will try less sauce than recommended.

!!!OMG!!! I was a bit hesitant to make this because of the stars and man ohhh man alive am I glad that I did! This is the most delicious lasagna that I have ever eaten. My husband who usually doesn't like anything with the sound of spinach or artichoke, devoured it. I made this just as the recipe calls for.

I made this recipe for a party yesterday, and it is delicious! I stuck pretty closely to the recipe: I used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and added a bit more feta). It tastes even better the day after as the flavours intensify a bit. A great and different veggie lasagna recipe—and I'm not a vegetarian!

This was really good. Def as good as any lasagna I've ever had in restaurant. I substituted a very strong cheesy homemade alfredo sauce for the red sauce and it worked so well. I've also made it with red sauce, and it was good but I just prefer a cream sauce. Use fresh lasagna noodles if you can make them or buy them, and use a food processor to mix the artichokes and spinach really well. Also freezes well.

This was a hit with my health-conscious in-lawsand 4-year-old!  Even my husband who needs meat with every meal loved it too. I doubled the artichokes, added mushrooms and ricotta and used about 3/4 of the can of broth (I subbed chicken for veggie broth) and only one jar of 26 oz pasta sauce.  The result was not at all soupy.  I used regular crumbled feta on top as well.  It does take a while to prep (I assembled on Fri, put it in the fridge, took it out Sun evening and let it get to room temp then cooked covered for 40 min at 450, then uncovered for the last 10 min.)  I am now sending this on to my sister-in-law who asked for the recipe.  I can't wait to try it with alfredo sauce!!!

This is a nice lasagne.  Per other reviewers, I reduced the broth by about 1/3 to avoid the soupy-ness that some described, and I'm glad I did.  I used chicken broth; it's all I had!  I thought the artichoke/spinach/tomato sauce fell just short of being enough, so I ended up adding a touch more of Muir Glen Fire-Roasted Pasta Sauce (so good!) for my top layer of sauce. Added just a bit of a good parmesan to the mozzarella/feta topping. I like this dish because it is satisfying but not overly-filling like a meat lasagne can be.  Thank you, David!

I made this last night for some guests, and everyone LOVED it!  I used 4 cups of cheese and added mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The feta really adds a great flavor.  I think next time I'll replace the artichokes with summer squash and red/yellow bell peppers.

This was really good - I basically followed the recipe.  Went a little lighter on the rosemary because it's not my favorite herb, and it was fine - I also only cooked the noodles a few minutes to soften them, next time won't precook them at all - I don't think they need it.  Different and good!

Very yummy! I added a homemade spaghetti sauce with hamburger in it b/c my boyfriend refuses to eat a main dish without meat. I don't think it hurt the recipe though. It was still very good!

This was a hit! I made the following changes:  I left out the onion due to taste preferences of one of my dinner guests.  I also used approximately half of the can of vegetable broth.  I added basil/grlic flavored tomato paste to the sauce and simmered for approx 15-20 minutes.  I pre-cooked the noodles and did not have any problems with them. I also added parmesan to the layers of mozzarella. My dinner guests raved and in fact one of them who is a professed non-veggie eater went home with the recipe and leftovers!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this a couple weeks ago for just two people.  It was great that night and for leftovers the next few days.  I used no-boil lasagna noodles because of earlier comments about there being too much liquid.  It turned out perfect. The feta added depth.  Only a couple modifications: I used regular crumbled feta and added italian spices to it.  I used 1 can of artichokes hearts (in water) and 1 small jar marinated in oil. I added about a cup of shredded mixed monterey jack/cheddar b/c I did not have enough mozzarella.

It's nothing like old-fashioned, fattening lasagna, but to be so healthy, this is scrumptious. I omitted nearly all cheese except for a few sprinkles of lite-mozz on top for eye appeal. No-bake noodles rock; just work quickly so they don't start to curl before you finish layering or pop in the oven.

This was good, although it seemed anticlimatic after reading all the excellent reviews.  I think it needs cottage cheese to give it some richness.

We enjoyed this.  Boyfriend says he can't think of anything wrong with it.  Next time we plan to add layers of zucchini, yellow squash, cottage cheese with the mozzarella, and maybe some tofu.  Would have preferred unmarinated artichokes.  Doubled the spinach.

Excellent - I will definitely make this again. The changes I made were: I used 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary (I did not have any fresh), and I used 1/4 cup parmesan to sprinkle on top (instead of the feta). I used whole wheat lasagna noodles. I used NON-marinated artichoke hearts instead of marinated. I would do the same again. It was delicious.

I made a few changes because I'm on diet...So I used whole-wheat lasagna and non-fat mozzarella and feta. The onions always blend very well with spinach, I don't know about the garlic thaw. I didn't use marinated artichoke either (to much calories and fat if you ask me). Overall it was a very good and interesting recipe! I'll probably make it for some dinner party!!!

This recipe consistanly performs and is so easy for an impressive meal.  Some things I modified.  
1. Use 1.5 bags of fresh, organic spinach
2. Use whole wheat lasagna noodles and do NOT boil them first.  Put the noodles, dry, directly in the baking dish - saves loads of time and mess!
3. Use various amounts of Italian cheese blends (there are many to choose from).
4.  Add Cremmeni (sp) mushrooms - they are terriffic!

I did not cook the noodles and they were awesome.  I used an 11X13 pan so I used one less layer but 5 1/2 noodles per layer.  I used 12 oz. of fresh spinach.  Too many onions if you ask me.  I'll cut it to 1/2 next time (but I also used Ragu with onions and garlic so that may be the problem!).  I skipped the rosemary- maybe next time I'll add some basil instead.  I used non- marinated artichoke hearts.  The feta was delicious on top- I only used 2 C of mozz. and it was plenty as we don't love cheese.  I also increased the sauce to 1 1/2 jars.  It was delicious the next day.

This is the first recipe I have rated - because it is that GOOD!  My  6 yr old picky eater even commented on the aroma in the house.  I have never made such a flavorful and healthy dish before.  I added mushrooms to the spinach/artichoke mixture and cut back on the vegetable broth and used regular unboiled lasagna noodles as others suggested and it baked just fine.  Next time, I will add the ricotta as others mentioned, didn't have it on hand this time.  GREAT RECIPE!

wonderful idea for a recipe. i personally did not like it, but i think that was because i decided to use a jar of tomato sauce, rather than making my own (being of italian decent, this probably would have been a better idea). just an "fyi" to those of you, like myself, that are picky about your tomato/pasta sauces. also, the next time i make it (and i will make it again!), i will probably substitute the feta cheese for a parmesean or asiago.

Followed the advice of others and did not boil the lasagna noodles.  No problem.  I used dried rosemary, but ground it with a mortar and pestle because I didn't want big pieces of it.  Made no other changes and it was great!

I have made so many recipes from this website that have been delicious and this is only the second one that did not pass the test. I usually have great success with 5 star recipes and this one fooled me and my family. There are so many better pasta recipes that taste far superior without all the effort that a lagagna requires.

one of the best lasagna recipes ever. use the boil-free noodles and the prep time is practically cut in half. also, use more sauce and less broth. all the broth can make things a big liquidy.

Absolutely wonderful!! Its a great alternative to the traditional veggie lasagna and it could also have meat added if so desired. I used one and half jars of tomato sauce (one traditional and one roasted garlic for added flavor) and it make the perfect amount. Thanks, will absolutely use this recipe again and again!!!!

Delicious! The feta cheese makes this very salty; I wouldn't recommend using any extra salt. I added sun-dried tomatoes (non-oil packed variety)to the sauce, and they complemented the lasagna well.  Also, I recommend using a smaller dish or adding more filling; this makes for a "short" lasagna. Will definately make many more times!

This is a great dish. I've tried making changes, but it always comes out best when I make it as suggested and add plenty of extra sauce (I use chunky vegetable primavera sauce) to the veggie mixture. Yummy, healthy alternative to traditional lasagna!

This recipe is now a staple in our house. I have made this dish with multiple variations and always gotten rave reviews. (Even from die-hard carnivores!)  One tip to save time: don’t bother pre-boiling the lasagna noodles.  I’ve used raw whole wheat and spelt lasagna noodles without fail. There is plenty of sauce for them to cook in.  You can substitute frozen collard greens for spinach for a different taste.  The feta cheese on top is not essential.  I highly recommend Muir Glen Organic Garden Vegetable Pasta Sauce for this recipe.  I think it is the rosemary in this dish that sets it apart from other lasagna recipes.

Oh wow - this lasange was absolutely delicious!  I was really hesitant about including the fresh rosemary (since I'm not a huge fan of the way it smells ...), but I think that it really added to the flavor.  Excellent recipe  :)

Personally I enjoy lasagna with ricotta it doesn't seem the same to me.  This didn't taste bad but I will not make again.

This was very good.  I made as a main course for a vegetarian Easter meal and it went over very well.  I just added mushrooms, used fresh spinach, and used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it was great!

Wow, I liked this lasagna better than traditional it was so full of taste!  The only thing I changed is that I put in 1 1/2 jars of pasta sauce.  Excellent recipe, thanks!

Oh MY!!!  This was just WAY too good!!  I recently had an awesome artichoke lasagna at a local restaraunt and I wanted to be able to make it at home, so I tried this recipe.  It was COMPLETELY different that the one at the restaraunt....but oh so much better!!  I used alfredo sauce instead of red sauce (I ended up using two full jars), used chicken broth instead of vegetables, and omitted the rosemary.  I didn't mind the flavored feta on top, but it was such a small amount that I'm not sure it added much.  I may try doubling it next time, or leaving it out altogether!!  Also, I did not boil the noodles before hand and it turned out perfectly!!   Definitley try his recipe!!  It's delish!!!

Love this recipe! For the sauce I make my own meat sauce using 3 or 4 italian sausages with the casings removed.  It adds a perfect amount of flavor and appeases meat lovers.

I like this lasagne as well as any that I order at a restaurant.  I've made this several times with the following modification: use one and a half jars of sauce (Classico Spicy Red Pepper as recommended by another reviewer) and add an extra layer of pasta - it seems more "filling" with the extra layer.

This was quick and easy - especially if you use No-Boil lasagne noodles.  The first time I made this, it turned out very salty and was skimpy on the filling.  I think it was the herb 'n garlic feta.  Made this a second time and increased the artichokes to two cans, used one and a half jars of pasta sauce and used parmesan for the topper instead of the feta (and the No-Boil!).  All in all, a very tasty dish.  My girlfriends raved!

I wasn't sure if my husband would like this, but he just loved it! He even liked the leftovers! I did use my own homemade sauce that had meat in it, and used 2 cubes of vegetable bouillon mixed with water. Don't skip out on the garlic & herb feta!! That really topped it off! Delicious!!

Well, I deviated from the recipe, but the result was wonderful.  My deviations included using 1 can of spinach, 1 3/4 c. homemade vegetable broth, 1 can of artichoke hearts (not marinated), 1 can of spinach, 1/2 jar tomato pasta sauce and 2 c. reduced fat mozzarella cheese.  I also used a 8" x 8" baking pan.  I imagine my version is healthier (but still delicious).

Excellent recipe.  Next time, I might add 1/3 less broth for greater firmness, but other than that, no changes.  A low fat idea might be to omit 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese (it's tasty but not absolutely necessary) and omit the feta.

a great veggie option, even for non-veggie people! i used sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce, and I used only about 20 oz. (the first time I made it, there was too much sauce). it seems like it would have too many flavors, but it works great! w/ no-cook lasagna noodles, this is easy and fast.

I thought it was just ok, not any better than other veggie lasagnas. I used a can rather than a jar of pasta sauce and ended up really needing that extra 2 ounces difference in content between the 2 types of packaging. Also I substituted ricotta for most of the mozzarella. That may have had something to do with the way it turned out.

This was really easy and very good.  I used 2 cups fat free, and 1 cup regular mozzarella and reduced fat basil and tomato feta.  I also used Emeril's Roasted Gaaahlic tomato sauce.  It turned out great, I can't wait for tonight's leftovers.

overall, this recipe was average. it looked gorgeous when i took it out of the oven. like a picture in a food magazine. but the taste was rather bland, and the lasanga was on the thin & whimpy side. nice change for a monday night dinner, but would not make again for company. it doesnt do the job to impress. i didnt get any "oohhhs & aahhhs" like i normally do when i cook. just a nod and an "allright".

My carnivore husband says that he likes this even better than meat lasagna! I just used plain feta cheese, decreased the onion, added mushrooms and it was wonderful.  Delicious! Great texture and taste; not bland like some veggie lasagna can be.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I didn't miss the meat at all, the texture of the artichoke and spinach mixture was great.  It tasted just as good, if not better then the lasagna I usually make.  This one is going to replace the heavy three hour lasagna recipe I used to make!  Thanks, David!

This is the BEST lasagna that I've ever had!  I made it for my family and there were NO leftovers!  I too added sauteed mushrooms and a small amount of low-fat ricotta cheese.  I didn't have a problem with the liquid, perhaps because I used the no-boil noodles.  This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent lasagna.  I used the no cook noodles that soaked up the extra liquid.

I just made this for a huge New Year's Eve potluck and three people asked for the recipe.  Truly excellent.  I should mention that I only gave a "Kid Friendly" rating of one star, as I have absolutely no idea if kids would like this.  I think that rating should be optional - I can say dozens of adults love this on New Year's Eve, for what that's worth!  :)

All I can say is YUMMY!! Great recipe I made this Christmas Day for some of my relatives who are vegetarians they loved it and so did many others. I used "Newmans Own Sockarooni Pasta Sauce" and it was absolutly the best, I also added some sauted mushrooms, I did not add as much broth because previous reviews said it was alittle soupy. Mine came out perfect. This is a Keeper, the feta cheese on top is the best! Thanks David!

This was great!  Entire family liked it.  The only thing I would change next time would be to add less broth.  As it is, I only added a half a can, and it was quite liquidy even though I know I drained the spinach and artichokes well.

I tried this recipe for a staff dinner. Our staff has a mix of vegetarians and meat eaters, so I wanted a dish which both would enjoy! Boy, did they ever! There was an empty pan very quickly...IT WAS A HIT !! I will be making it again soon, I am sure :-) Thanks.

Tried this recipe as a variation to the same boring meals we have and it was awesome!!  I used beef broth instead of vegetable broth ( I didn't have it), dried rosemary instead of fresh, fresh spinach instead of frozen, added oregano and mushrooms, and topped it with both mozzarella and feta. My husband and his buddy raved about it!  Will DEFINITELY make again--Thanks Dave!!

Good. NO broth needed. I just used the artichoke juice and still soupy. Dried rosemary would be fine too. Fresh gave it a very strong flavor. Added mushrooms & used Chunky Garden Vegtable pasta sauce and it was really good.  My vegitarian friends loved it.

I added zucchini to the sauce and it was yummy.  Be careful not to put too much of the sauce mixture on the bottom in the first layer.  Next time, I'll make twice as much and freeze one lasagne!

wow.
i have always loved meaty lasagna... no more.  this is now my permanent lasagna.  delicious.  balance of flavors was perfect.  i made only one change.  i put an 8oz container of fresh sliced mushrooms in the pan with the onions and garlic to saute together.  i just couldn't make a lasagna without mushrooms... i just couldn't.  i did worry about the "soupy" comment by several of the other reviewers, so i never covered my pan while simmering.  the dish came out perfect.  absolutely perfect.
(my mother-in-law took some to work as a leftover for her lunch the next day and one of her coworkers called me immediately for the recipe & made it that very night... and her family LOVED it, too)

Excellent veggie lasagna.  We left out the onions, used fresh spinach, and we should have reduced the broth (really soupy).  My son, the vegetarian didn't want this recipe because he has had so much lousy commercially prepared spinach lasagna that he dreaded this, but he really liked it, as did the meat eaters.

This recipe takes some time to put together, but WOW it is definitely worth it.  We had it after a t-ball game one evening.  The adults absolutely loved it and the kids wanted more.  Who needs to go out to eat italian when you can make this for the fraction of the cost.  Way to go.  5 BIG STARS!!!!

Best lasagna ever!  It's even better as a leftover (if there are any leftovers), because all the ingredients have a chance to sit overnight and mix together.

I live in a dual omnivore/herbivore household, so it's tough to find things that my girlfriend will eat (she's vegetarian) and that are hearty enough for me. This is! Our son loves it too. I use Barilla "no cook" lasagna noodles, which make this even easier to make.

Yum!! One of my favorites. Even my husband likes it. Just proves you don't need meat to have a fabulous dinner. I never cook lasagne noodles...just add 1/4 cup of water at opposite ends of the pan.

Very good, and a nice change for lasagna.  Next time I will experiment with a little more filling, and less broth.  It was a little watery.

This was a unique dish with really nice flavour. I'll be careful next time to choose a flavourful pasta sauce that adds to the dish instead of the pasta sauce I used. I chose a tomato and basil and it just wasn't robust enough to add anything to the  overall dish. Will definitely be making this again. Thank you for a great recipe.

This turned out just lovely!! When I added the vegetable broth, I was a little nervous that the dish might come out runny, so I ended up using half of a jar of sauce. I used whole grain pasta and low-fat feta. I don’t think it cut back on the flavor at all. What a great recipe?

Wow, they didn't even notice it was vegetarian.  I can't wait to make this again . My modifications:  for the cheese, I used  about a cup of Parmesan, a cup of Mozzarella,  one round of Boursins Garlic and Herb Gourney cheese and an egg.  (Did not have feta)  I also added a cup of fresh spinach in addition to the frozen.  Huge hit for my normally meat eating family.

Made this for a friend who had surgery and it got rave reviews. Can’t wait to make it for me!  I followed the recipe almost exactly... just added some extra seasoning—Pampered Chef Garlic Rosemary blend in addition to the fresh rosemary. Really simple to make. Thank you for an excellent recipe.

This is a really good recipe that can be customized to your tastes. I used oven-ready lasagna noodles so I didn't have to boil the pasta first, but otherwise made it as directed. Next time I'll add zucchini and yellow squash.

Solid dish - made this for some vegetarian friends who came over. Subbed the frozen spinach for fresh, and used no boil lasagna noodles, but followed the recipe otherwise. Nice lasagna!

So I loved this dish. The texture was a little off putting for a lasagna at first so it took some getting used to, which is why it only got 4 stars.; but as soon as I got used to it not being a true lasagna I really enjoyed it a lot. I think next time I will add ricotta cheese to the veggie mix or something but other than that it was perfect.

This recipe turned out watery.  Next time I will use eggs and probably ricotta and cut down on the broth.  I used fresh spinach and it worked well.  I'll make it again with adjustments.

Pretty dang delish. Made my own "herb and garlic feta", added a pound of Italian sausage. Increased mozzarella, and decreased noodles by 1/3. Recommend not overcooking the onions, as the crispness gave the dish a whole new texture which was awesome. Boyfriend loved this dish! (And that's impressive, because he is definitely a better cook than I am.)

Love this... I also add shredded chicken and two jars of sauce. Made this with some homemade garlic bread and a salad with homemade Greek dressing for a dinner party I had a few months ago and it was a hit!! I had no left overs for the next day (which kinda made my heart sad lol) but that’s a good thing!!

Pretty good!  Didn’t have vegetable broth so I just added another jar of spaghetti sauce.  I used no-boil noodles presoaked in warm water while I was simmering other ingredients.  This was a nice and solid lasagne, not watery at all!

I thought this was really good! I added some sliced mushrooms and 2 small zucchini’s sliced. I only added 1/2 the broth and made up the difference in liquid using more sauce. I also used ready to cook gluten free noodles that I bought at Vons. This will be my go-to recipe.

Everyone loved this recipe!! I made it mostly as is except I added ricotta to the mozzarella layer. Also, I made the sauce/ artichoke/spinach/broth mixture two days before putting the lasagna together and it mixed together really well. I didn't pre-cook the noodles and they came out great.

Everyone absolutely loved it.  I followed directions except that I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  About 10 ounces I guess.  I didn’t quite dice it…but smaller than a chop.  Also, I cooked it 40 minutes covered, 25 uncovered(10 more than in directions because it seemed wet), and then let it sit for about 20.  Also, I couldn’t find Garlic & herb feta so I used Garlic & tomato feta.  I also used 4 Cups Mozz instead of 3.  Don’t pay attention to the comments about it being too wet. Also used no boil Gluten Free lasagna noodles.  If you didn’t tell people there was no meat in here they wouldn’t even know.

I goofed and didn't buy a large enough brick of cheese, so be sure to buy at least a pound. It came out a bit watery when I made it, and that was even with adjusting it on my own to bake 30 mins. with foil and 30 mins. without. I didn't have time to consult any of the other reviews beforehand. Overall, a very tasty meal pared with garlic bread and a side salad.

I also did not precook the noodles and it came out perfect. I didn’t care for the artichokes so I omitted them the second time I made this. I subbed with fresh spinach, mushrooms, and zucchini. Also added a layer of ricotta. Very good recipe!

This was a wonderful vegetarian lasagna!  I added sliced yellow zucchini  and baby bellas to my sauce, but accidentally forgot the spinach.  Quite honestly, we didn't miss it.  Also added some lowfat cottage cheese as a layer.  Definitely a keeper!

Super yummy and fairly easy to prepare.  Most time consuming is to make sure spinach is well drained & dried so the dish isn't watery.   We substituted Basil for the Rosemary (just a personal preference).  This one is a keeper!

Added sliced baby bella mushrooms, some fresh basil and parsley from the garden. Sprinkled feta cheese on the top right before serving.  (I agree with the other comment about cutting back on the broth...too watery if the suggested amount is used). Other than that, it turned out just right.

This was a big hit for our entire household, including the non-vegetarians! It was polished off the next day and the leftovers were even better. Our sauce was not watery, but we simmered it for twice as long as the directions recomended.

I loved the addition of feta cheese on top, which I usually don't put on a lasagna.  My husband felt that the end product was too watery, so we will use less vegetable broth in the sauce next time.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was delicious.  The second time, I substituted home-made alfredo sauce for the tomato sauce and it was even better1

This recipe was really, really good.  I used less broth and also used the broth from the artichokes.  I added oregano and basil as well.  I will use more rosemary next time.  Very easy and very tasty.  Everyone in the house loved it.

I added some frozen grilled chicken into this and we had a mouthgasm. You should increase the cheese quotient, and I doctor'd the mix with a little basil and oregano. I also ditched the feta for some pepper jack. Mmmmmmmmmmmm, belisimo.

This was delicious!! The only thing I did different is add some mushrooms to it - just cuz I had them! 
Not watery at all.  Matter of fact I was making this dish with a guest who was not eating any dairy bi products at all... so I made a small portion for her - using vegan cheese substitutes.  I browned some ground turkey on the side, mixed in some marinara sauce and herbs for those who might want to add meat to it... all in all, we were 8 adults with barely any leftovers!! Everyone raved about it!!  Thank you for a recipe that isn’t delicious as is, but which can easily be tweaked without losing its awesome flavors!!  Ps. Just wish I had taken a picture! It looked great too!!

My family can't stop talking about how much they liked this recipe. As other reviewers suggested, I used lasagna noodles right from the box. They cooked up just fine. I also cooked and used a steam in bag of chopped spinach. It did not need to be drained.  I will definitely make this for company. It was delicious!

Added carrots ,just for added color and texture.  Extra spinach leaf every layer along with cooked ones  . It was very good might try it with Alfredo sauce next time since it is like an artichoke dip.

I had enough for 3 different meals (for my hubbie and I). I also used fresh cut up spinach (much easier  than squeezing out frozen spinach.) I love Bertolli Portabello Mushroom sauce. It says in recipe to use 28 oz, but most jars sauce are 24 oz) 
***DO NOT PUT SO MUCH VEGGIE BROTH***. It doesn't need it. I only used 3/4 cup chicken broth which work out fine. I also used it more as a side dish, and had Italian Sausage grilled on BBQ together with this  and it was perfecto! But if you have a vegetarian in the group, it is the perfect thing to serve.

Nice 15 lb verge lasagna. Followed some suggestion, less broth, more sauce, did not cook noodles .Texture was great..nice and chewy. However, I thought BLAND!! Gave it a day in fridge..and what REALLY  helped was a some Tabasco sauce! Made things pop!! Then me and hubby were happy. May add sautéed mushrooms next time just for more texture.

Btw..from TX.

Anytime I can make lasagna is good, especially when I add vegetables.  I like to add a bit of a kick  when making vegetables, so I add a touch of hot pepper depending on the availability of what I can get ( jalapeño  or poblano, or even a touch of good hot sauce like a good Tabasco product.

Very good! And I do hate when people review recipes and then change it up...but I did...I was afraid of all the broth (liquid), so I did dump some out before adding the bottle of tomato sauce. I didn’t boil the noodles first and they were fine. I did add a handful of baby Bella mushrooms and sprinkled  the top with goat cheese because I had it and needed to use it up. I would make this again.

This recipe is amazing.  I think as others mentioned in their reviews, a white Alfredo sauce would pair perfectly however it is great with red sauce too.  I also used the regular uncooked lasagna noodles that were suggested in the reviews and I like the tall lasagna so I used a smaller square baking dish.  Substituted the basil for the rosemary and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  This definitely is a keeper.  Love it!!!

Okay, this recipe is a winner. We have vegetarian friends, so I’m always looking for ways to satisfy all of us without compromising their dietary lifestyle.

The recipe was fun to make. It went together faster than my usual lasagna, and was far more nutritious.

I took hints from previous reviewers. The layer of ricotta, Italian seasoning, and basil added an extra dimension we all enjoyed. The use of fewer lasagna noodles added to the flavor as well. (Next time I’ll substitute thin-sliced eggplant.)

This recipe is a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing it with us.

My favorite veggie lasagna recipe.  I'm not really into ricotta cheese, but I do love feta, so this one is a keeper.  I've made it several times and I don't think it needs any modifications.  However, I'm sure this would be good with basil instead of rosemary, as several reviewers mentioned.

This is delicious. Coming from a person who doesn’t usually like veggie lasagna. I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen and tomato purée instead of pasta sauce. I also didn’t pre cook the noodles. I made sure they were all covered in sauce and they have the perfect bite to them. It was a lot more hearty and substantial that I thought it’d be!l

Loved the flavor and this would be worthy of 5 stars if not for the fact that it’s so watery. Even after letting it stand, I had to drain off the liquid before serving. I highly recommend omitting the can of vegetable broth.

This was amaaazing! I doubled up on the spinach, garlic and added half a container of fresh cherry tomatoes! Also added fresh ground pepper and 1 tsp red pepper flakes. I think one thing that made a huge difference was using the full amount of vegetable broth and letting it reduce to about half before adding the tomatoes, spinach and tomatoes paste. This was delicious. Thank you!!

This was really, really good.  I omitted the broth (I believe including the broth will result in a watery consistency), added portabella mushrooms to the sauce, and doubled the amount of spinach.  I also inserted layers of ricotta cheese (I put the fresh rosemary in the ricotta instead of including it in the sauce).  I see a lot of raters chose to use a white sauce over of a tomato-based sauce, but please note marinara is most definitely a culinary match with these ingredients.  My husband wasn't that excited about this dish because he thinks lasagna should always have meat, but I disagree.  The flavor profile on this dish is unique and delicious, and I won't hesitate to make it again.  If he doesn't like it, he can cook dinner.  Yeah, that's not happening...  he can barely make a reservation ;)

We made this for neighbors who had a baby.  They loved it so much we made it for ourselves - and Loved it too.  A definite keeper.  We didn’t change anything! Actually - we did use lots of fresh spinach instead of frozen - was awesome.

Good for a vegetarian main dish. Prep is longer than 20 minutes. Next time we'll use a low sodium broth.

Fabulous! I added a box of fresh mushrooms (pint) saluted with veggies, and a second box of spinach and a bit more chicken broth after I saw how much liquid was absorbed. Delicious recipe! Highly recommend

This is, hands down, the best lasagna I have ever eaten!  I stumbled across it when we had a vegetarian friend over for dinner, and he had mentioned his favorite vegetable was artichoke.  It was so good that now it's the only lasagna recipe I use.  Even my carnivorous hubby, and our three picky kids gobble it up.  It also reheats deliciously!  Almost better the second day.  The only changes I made to the original recipe were to scale it down slightly for a smaller pan, use dried rosemary and Italian seasoning in place of the fresh rosemary (because that's what I usually have on hand), and don't precook the noodles.  The sauce is sufficiently watery that it actually comes out better if you use dry lasagna noodles.

This is one of my favorite recipes that I never get tired of making! However, I use the no-boil noodles instead of boiling them. This helps this lasagna to be MUCH less watery. I also make sure I choose a low-moisture mozzarella cheese for this reason.

Easy to customize. I used 6oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen. I was very generous with the cheese and used a homemade marinara sauce. I think a good marinara sauce is key to the full flavor of this dish.  I was worried it would be too watery, as the filling was pretty juicy when i layered it in, but the noodles sucked up all the extra juice and it was fine!

Tried this for my family including two teenagers. Lasagna is my favorite dish and this is my new favorite lasagna. Love the artichokes and spinach, couldn't even tell there was no meat. Took advice of reviewers and did not cook noodles, worked out just fine.

I'm obsessed with this recipe. I thought, oh just another veggie lasagna, but it turned out fabulous and everyone in the family loved it. I think the artichokes and feta give it a little extra tang, and  the texture was really creamy considering there was no ricotta or cottage cheese. I'm definitely adding this to my regular rotation!

This was an easy recipe and one that fit in with my families three vegetarian meals for every meat meal plan. I did run into the issue of excess liquid the first time and made a few mods of my own, most of them have been mentioned in other comments but I will include them anyway. 1. I used vegetable stock and did a partial reduction before adding. 2. I added uncooked mushrooms that I roughly chopped into the filling just before layering (they soaked up plenty of moisture and flavor).  I boiled my noodles a minute and a half less than al-dente and cooked my lasagna twenty minutes longer uncovered. The pasta was perfect when the dish was done and I had no excess moisture. 

My only other notion was trading rosemary for oregano, but that is just my taste.

Very good recipe. I took some advice from some other reviews and only added about 3/4 can broth and didn't use rosemary I switched to basil. I also added ground turkey just to give it a little bulk. My family loved it

A friend made this using regular noodles and it was a 5 !!! 
 I made it using Target's 9 oz. "Simply Balanced" oven ready gluten free noodles, and it was a little watery. It could be that the spinach was the culprit.
  I have since read that GF products absorb more liquid, so fewer oz. of the product would be used,  which may be the reason GF noodles come in 9 oz instead of 12 oz. packages.
Will update review when I make it again soon.

Love, love, love this recipe. I have yet to have any company try this and dislike it, and luckily it can cater to vegetarians in your social circles. I have in the past made this without having vegetable broth on hand--if you're a carnivore like me, chicken broth works just fine as a substitute without really changing the flavor drastically. 
There are a few things I do differently with the recipe. First and foremost, DO NOT boil the noodles. There is absolutely no reason to; they will cook fine in the lasagna, since the sauce is so liquid to begin with. Added bonus--no extra effort or dishes using this method! I use whole wheat noodles and have never had problems doing it this way. I get 1/2 a carton of ricotta cheese (normally about a cup of cheese total) and add about 2 tbs of parsley flakes to it, then stir. I spread this cheese with my first two layers of mozzarella in the lasagna. What can I say, I like the creamy ricotta texture. I also usually can't find "garlic and herb feta" at my local grocery store, so I just use plain feta cheese and sprinkle some dried Italian seasoning on top of it instead.

I liked this recipe because it was simple and didn't require a huge amount of cheese the way many lasagnes do. However, I found the artichoke to be overpowering (made it kind of vinegary) so next time I make it I'm going to try doubling the spinach to artichoke ratio.

I did tweek this a bit. I added some fresh spinach along with the frozen. I added some fresh thyme and basil I had left over and mushrooms cooked in extra garlic.  I am not a vegetarian so I used some cooked hamburger ,  and used extra juice from a can of whole tomatoes instead of the broth. 
All in all, it came out the best I have ever had. I will never make plain  lasagna again!

This would be a worthy entree for vegetarian dinner party. I didn't have a can of broth so instead of draining the artichoke hearts, I just poured that marinade in! I had also run out of pasta sauce, so I substituted a can of chopped tomatoes. It was very tasty indeed! Great consistency. Nice change up from the ordinary veggie lasagna that uses zucchini or eggplant. I will make it again!

This was a hit in my house!  I added fresh spinach in lieu of frozen.  I also added some diced black olives to the artichoke mixture.  The last change?  I added thin layers of ricotta & fresh spinach.

This was fabulous! I did add ricotta- I think it would've been way too thin without it. I also subbed Italian seasoning for the fresh rosemary because we don't care for it. I cut the broth down to one cup - I think it would've been way to soupy with more. I used the oven-ready noodles. My husband (who usually asks, "where's the meat?") said he liked this better than traditional lasagna!

Like others I used fresh spinach, added a ricotta layer (ricotta, beaten egg and Parmesan mixed together) and used alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also used the no-boil noodles and they worked great.  My family LOVED it and immediately asked for it to be added to the rotation. Next time I will add a lot more spinich. Great recipe!

A fan favorite with our visting families. I made it with cooked noodles but I found that no cook noodles work best. I don't use any spays so olive oil to saute and smeared in baking dish. Let the broth simmer until most liquid is gone. I also changed it up adding a dash of oregano or basil and used half red sauce and half alfredo to make a pink sauce. Vodka sauce would work great too!

This lasagna comes out amazing every time I make it. I sub basil or parsley instead of rosemary and don't cook the noodles beforehand - I find they get the perfect texture cooking in the sauce in the oven.

Very easy recipe. Don't get too caught up with all the different variations. It is good as it is stated. My only exception is that I don't precook the noodles. Made this over and over again. Delist!

Disclaimer: I made this without spinach and also used no-boil noodles. That said, fantastic recipe. Tastes great and the portion sizes are perfect.

This was pretty good overall on my first attempt to make it. I let the mixture simmer a little longer to help all the excess juice evaporate and I added cheddar cheese to the top layer rather than feta. I think I will decrease the artichokes by half next time and add in other veggies such as zucchini, squash, carrots, and/or broccoli.

Made modifications based on prior comments:
- used less broth
- alfredo instead of regular sauce
- layer of ricotta
- oregano/basil instead of rosemary. used probably double what the recipe called for and same for garlic.
I didn't pre cook pasta, but it still came out pretty watery, which I don't mind. It was very good, but not super delicious.

I liked this but I will definitely add ricotta when I make it again. It was lacking the delicious richness that you get from ricotta in traditional lasagna.  I didn't  think it was too watery because I used a slotted spoon to create the veggie layers.  I also added fresh mushrooms because I had them on hand.

With the following additions, this lasagna is a HIT! Cut down the broth to 1/2 and add ricotta between the layers. Ricotta is a MUST in any lasagna!

4.9 stars because I think it must be improved on when homemade sauce is used.   Took a risk making it for company and LOVED it!    I was worried based on a few reviews but this was flavorful and delicious even to the meat loving peops.     My vegetarian friends said it was delicious and announced to my husband "your wife is an excellent cook!" Which they clearly were not obligated to add...   I wished I had doubled the recipe because I wanted MORE :-).  It's lighter than meat lasagna. 
I followed directions almost exactly using no-boil noodles except that I make my own simple pasta sauce instead of jarred (with olive oil garlic and onion sautéed before adding a can of whole tomatoes to simmer.).  I use that as a base in lots of recipes requiring sauce.    I also used fresh chopped spinach and of course salted my homemade sauce to taste.  Oh, and I did add a splash of cream to the sauce according to one reviewer suggestion but I'm not sure if that made a difference.
Regarding reviews complaining of flavorless ness, I can only think that maybe they didn't use  marinated artichokes which have strong flavor or perhaps they didn't add enough salt which was left out of recipe since jarred sauces usually have sufficient salt.    I can't help but think homemade sauce makes a big difference here.
I can't wait to make this again!!!!  Thanks- I am adding this to my recipes and feel like a real homecooking chef like those ladies I always admire ;-).

Loved it, but made some changes....

Didn't want it to be too watery like all the other reviews wrote. So I doubled the spinach (added 1 cup of Alfredo sauce), added onion and sliced tomato and a crusted cheese topping. (1 cup of crutons or  seasoned bread crumbs and mix with your choice of cheese) Delicious!

I love lasagna and this is a great variation to the traditional dish! Changes I made:  I used 2/3 of broth, ready to bake noodles, 12 oz bagged fresh spinach, Italian spice instead of rosemary, traditional feta,  and added light ricotta to each layer and went a bit heavier on the mozzarella. It was just slightly runny, but not bad. I might cut back to just 1/2 the broth next time, otherwise my wife (a vegetarian) and I (a meat lover) enjoyed it very much, so thanks for the recipe! God bless!

Great lasagna! Would give this recipe 4.5 stars but I have rounded up to 5 stars because I had to make some modifications due to the ingredients I had on hand. Unfortunately, I didn't have any herbed feta cheese so I ended up using herbed goat cheese which was good but may have been a bit overpowering. I also had some ricotta I needed to get rid of so I used that as well. Overall great lasagna. The layers held together like a dream! I will make it again!

Read reviews about it being wet, so cooked the pan of sauce and spinach and artichokes and vege broth long enough to get it more like thick sauce. Then read another review about no need to cook the lasagna noodles, so I quit trying to tear apart the stuck-together noodles, and used them dry. It was perfect, but I did add more sauce since it comes as 24 ounce jars, not 28 ounces. Roughly 37 ounces I figured. And I was generous with the mozzarella, as I wanted every corner perfect and ended up using about 8 more ounces (at least--maybe more) than it called for.  We didn't have anything but plain feta cheese, so I added a packet of Italian seasoning that I had, but I'm sure any mix of Italian seasonings would do. I'll make this again.

Oops! Posted too soon!  I added 8oz chopped roasted red pepper as well as a mix of scallion and yellow onion. I substituted 25 oz Alfredo sauce for tomato and added three layers of a mix of 18 oz ricotta with fresh chopped parsley and 1 egg mixed in. Also used mozzarella for an extra cheesy lasagna.

Everyone loved this recipe! I didn't have marinated artichokes or frozen spinach, so I satueed 4 garlic cloves, 1/2 red onion, 1 small yellow onion, chopped red bell pepper in about 2T evoo, and then added a bag of fresh spinach, seasoned everything with dried parsley, oregano, basil, and 2 splashes of balsamic vinegar. Once that was cooked down I added the broth and artichokes. My sauce was a bit thin and I felt like there was too much liquid and I wanted it to thicken up so I added about 2T of flour. I started with noodles when layering in the pan, not the artichoke mixture. I also layered the feta along with the mozzarella, about 1 oz for each layer and then 2 oz for the top. When I make it again, I will use less broth.

Best lasagna ever! I tweak my recipe a bit and add layers of ricotta cheese. I also add mushrooms into my spinach/artichoke mix. Oh, and oven ready to cook noodles are way easier to work with rather than boiled. I've served this to the pickiest meat eaters and they loved it and were astounded that it could taste so good with no meat at all!

This was surprisingly good - i didn't know how the marinated artichokes would go with sauce but it worked.  The one change i made is i added ricotta -- lasagna just isn't lasagna without it :-)

Very simple to make,  and it got great reviews.  I used Newman's garlic and herb pasta sauce, and plain feta because my store didn't have the garlic and herb.  I added more garlic to compensate, no problem!

Very good and the feta was a nice touch.  I might use a little more next time.  9 lasagna noodles are about half of a package.  I used 1 tsp of dry rosemary instead of fresh, but I didn't really like the flavor.  Next time I'll use basil, oregano or Italian spices.

I made this recipe exactly as is and it was a winner.  I took leftovers to work to get a second opinion and they (4 guys) said it was delicious.

Every vegetarian dish I make my dad always says something like "it's good but this could be better with sausage..." This is he ONE dish he has never said that and regularly asks me to make it. I personally favor it much more than traditional lasagna. Make sure the spinach is thoroughly dried though before adding it to the mixture as it can become watery, but other than that the recipe is wonderful.

Made this for dinner because the couple joining us are vegetarians.  This was an awesome recipe.  My additions were minimal.  I sautéed mushrooms and onion together before adding everything else.  I realized too late that I didn't have quite enough mozzarella cheese on hand so I added manchango cheese as well.  I also added sliced olives.  It was wonderful.

Made with ready to cook lasagna noodles - was just as delicious! Everything was delicious. The only thing I'd change would be to keep the artichokes a little bigger and chunkier. And maybe add mushrooms and pine nuts.

I made this for company and everyone LOVED it! However, I did add a layer of ricotta cheese, which I think was necessary in order to taste like a legit lasagna. (For the ricotta layer mix one container with one beaten egg and 2 Tbsp. dried parsley.)  In order to make sure that it wasn't too runny, I simmered down the veggie broth until it was nearly gone. It turned out perfectly. I will experiment making this recipe with different types of veggies.

Everyone loved this! Didn't precook my noodles, just soaked them. I made it in a smaller dish, needed fewer noodles, but it made it higher. Yummo!

Excellent recipe! Made some minor tweaks as others suggested such as cutting down on broth and added some cherry tomatoes to the veggies but otherwise closely followed recipe and so so good! And as always with Italian, better the next day. Thank you.

I personally liked it but my hubby wasn't to stoked about it.  But then again he's a little pick.  He did state that he would eat it again but never request it.  That's not too bad.

Made this for dinner party last night. A couple of the guests are vegetarians. I am not. Everyone loved it. Will definately make this again. Not just for vegetarians either. Very yummy. I doubled all the ingredients and made it just as written except I used the no boil noodle's. I layered the lasagna pan until it was full.

The changes I made were no-cook noodles rather than cooking the noodles first.  I used home-canned roasted tomato sauce, fresh spinach and a an entire 25 oz. jar of marinated artichoke hearts - chopped in my Cuisinart.  I probably used more cheese as well - did not measure.  Baked it the day before the dinner then reheated at 350 covered for about half an hour.  Big hit by my vegetarian family for Thanksgiving.  Yumm!  I will make this one again!

This is a good recipe but it definitely needs things added. Since I was worried about it being soggy I only cooked my noodles for about 5 minutes and that worked out well. I added ricotta as well. I wanted to try and keep it to the original recipe but I wish I had added more seasonings. It's not bad but its not amazing although I feel that it truly could be if maybe more veggies and seasonings were added. I'm looking forward to making it again with those changes.

Always a hit. I saute the frozen spinach with the onions and garlic and use Italian blend seasoning instead of rosemary. I also use the oven ready lasagna noodles so no pre-cooking necessary for that!

This was fantastic.  I got the recipe from the All Recipes magazine and it only called for 1 cup of vegetable broth, So mine was not watery as I read others came out.  I also used Arrabiatta sauce.    I can't wait to make it again for all my friends!

I've made this dish several times to great reviews but have always found it a little watery. I've tried with uncooked lasagna today and that was even better and needless to say easier. I always add mushrooms, parmigiana cheese and use fresh spinach. So delicious!!!

My family thought the leftovers tasted better of this dish.  I used a can of artichokes and my husband and I agreed that it left a funny taste in our mouths.  I attribute it to the artichokes.  Next time I would add more cheese to the layers.

I loved this, my family liked it, not a typical lasagna they were expecting. There is a lot of flavor packed into this lasagna. With a few modification, the portions were also about 300 calories, 9 generous portions in the pan. I used whole wheat pasta, only 2 cups of cheese, and added canned chicken breast.  My 4 year old ate it and getting him to have a dose of green veg besides a few random green beans here and there is a challenge. Very good, will make again.

VERY good recipe! I made a couple of very slight changes...I added some fresh mrooms when I cooked the onions, I used 24 oz. jar of a mushroom spaghetti sauce, and I used regular feta with a little garlic powder and some basil. Mine did not turn out runny in the slightest, I also waited 10 minutes before I cut it, I think that helps keep it from being runny.

This was one lasagna recipe I've tried that my husband loved! I added a little more spinach and I topped it with more spaghetti sauce before I added the feta. It was great! I was concerned about the broth but that cooked off fairly well. Not an issue.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit with my family and friends. I made some changes: I cut the vegetable broth in half, it was too watery as directed. I also tend to add additional things each time I make it. At different times I've added green peppers, mushrooms, black beans, oregano, thyme, tofurkey Italian sausage...really it depends on what I find around the house. Regardless of the additions we all love it! This will be one recipe that definitely stays in rotation at our home.

This is one of my go-to recipes.  I love that it's lighter than a regular lasagna but no one seems to care.  It's vegetarian and if made with rice lasagna noodles, it's gluten free too.  I make it exactly as written.

This recipe is amazing! A truly fantastic vegetarian recipe. The lasagna can turn out watery, so be sure to get the spinach as dry as you can after rinsing and before adding it. The same for the lasagna noodles after boiling them. I'm not vegetarian so sometimes I add chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Every time I make this the family goes absolutely crazy. The prep work isn't too bad for this, and it's healthy and delicious.  Win-win situation.

So easy and tasted great.  A Greek inspired twist on traditional lasagna.  I was skeptical, but really enjoyed it!

I can't say that I actually followed the directions because I pretty much made my regular meatless lasagna and put artichokes in it, but I give it 5 stars for the idea because it turned out great!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didnt precook my noodles and I added 2 cups of ricotta cheese to the mozzarella cheese.  Just before placing in the oven, I added 3/4 cup of water around the edges (for the noodles) and it turned out perfectly!!  Thank you!

Used all noodles, added more motz, and provolone to layers. Would have rated a 5...next time will use smaller amount of rosemary...

This was tasty, but as one reviewer stated, a bit watery (even without putting the whole can of vegetable broth in it.. Great as a base vegetarian Lasagna recipe to play around with though! I might add the ricotta cheese or use Alfredo sauce next time to get just the right consistency.

I added zucchini and spinach as suggested and used plain tomato sauce and blended a can of whole tomatoes instead of using jarred sauce. I have found from experience that the less "stuff" in the sauce the better the over all flavor of the lasagna. This turned out really good. I have wanted to make veggie lasagna for a long time and must say I am glad I finally did! I will use this recipe again and again. Perhaps next time I will try roasted veggies as someone had suggested. Yum!

Really good and got good comments!  Used a 12-oz bag of fresh spinach and no-boil noodles (worked great).  Would strain veggie mixture before adding sauce next time.  I substituted red sauce for pre-made alfredo sauce.  Made in a 10 x 10 pan so it was higher.  Thinking chicken may be a good addition to add more bulk.  It was delicious, just thinking for the future.

I brought this to book club and it was a huge hit, even with non-vegetarians. I used no-boil lasagna noodles, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will add more heat to the filling, maybe add some red pepper flakes and more garlic.

This is superb!  I tinkered a bit as I always do (no, I don't remember exactly what I changed but it was nothing major) and I used uncooked noodles.  Very, very good and the noodles were just right!  I'll definitely make this again and again.

A great recipe made better once you follow other reviewers' tips to use the alfredo sauce instead of the tomato sauce, cut down on Rosemary, and add ricotta cheese. I served it to a mixed group of meat eaters and vegetarians, and they all loved it.

Delicious and enjoyed by all the family I used basil instead of rosemary and used no boil/oven ready lasagna noodles to speed up the process.  This one is a keeper.

Based on other reviews I almost doubled the sauce and used a sundried tomato alfredo sauce instead of regular spaghetti sauce.  It was a huge hit and completely devoured!

There's not a lot of sauce for the lasanga.. I was worried about it being dry. But surprisingly, this wasn't an issue. The lasagna was delicious. Edit: I forgot to mention... I used homemade chicken stock instead of the broth, homemade pasta sauce (basically tomato sauce + seasonings), unmarinated artichoke hearts and plain feta. It was literally PERFECT.

This was the best I ever made or tasted honestly. I usually make lasagna with beef and sausage, didn't miss them. I used whole wheat noodles due to specific diet which I usually hate but the flavor is so good it covered them up! Family loved it too. Will make again. Thanks!

This was one of the best Lasagna's I've ever made!  Thanks for the recipe.  I made my own sauce, used Rice Lasagna Noodles and skipped the Feta and it turned out fantastic.  Will be making this again very soon.

As is, I liked this recipe but it does need some tweaking.  Like other reviewers, I DID NOT cook the noodles first and for more layers I prepared it in a 8x8 inch baking dish.  I used about 1 3/4 of a cup of veggie broth.  Only because I bought a box instead of a can.  Before I "assembled" it the spinach artichoke mixture was a little bland so I added pepper and garlic salt to taste.  After the changes it was absolutely delish.  My meat eaters didn't even miss the meat.  This is a keeper.

So awesome! I did do some modifications this time but I have also prepared as written. This time I added some mushrooms to the onion and garlic sautee along with the rosemary at that time. I then added two 6oz jars of marinated artichokes along with the oil/liquid mixture that they came in. I let all that simmer for awhile before adding an entire bag of baby spinach and veggie stock. I decided to try jarred alfredo sauce this time around. I bought roasted poblano alfredo sauce. I didn't realize that it had a spicy kick to it but that worked great actually. I then added 2 T of capers, some fresh pepper, and about 2t of dried basil. I allowed all that to simmer for about 10 minutes before I prepared everything with no boil lasagna noodles. I think adding the alfredo sauce make this 5 star recipe a 10 start in the end! I will def be making again and again! Thanks so much! :)

After a few modifications, this is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Like many others, I didn't cook the noodles and I did double the recipe (fit perfectly in my "lasagna pan").  I used basil instead of the rosemary and used some crushed red pepper and spicy cheese on top as we wanted a little more "zip!"
Will make again!!

The flavor is right, but the sauce is too watery.  It could have used some tomato paste or maybe just void the broth and simmer the ingredients in the sauce.

I loved this, my spouse said it wasn't bad. Coming from  a person who is afraid of artichokes and suspicious of anything meatless, that is actually high praise.   Made it with half the broth (per the comments) and did not precook the pasta.   One caveat, I made it in  a 7x11 pan and expected left over sauce. There wasn't any, in fact I only had enough sauce for 3layers(2layers of pasta). Not sure how this is supposed to make a 9x 13 dish.

This is my very review on this site. I followed this recipe exactly except for not cooking the noodles at all, and it came out too "soupy". I doubled it and may have made a mistake somewhere but the sauce was still really good. I ran out to the store and bought all the ingredients again. This time however I only used half can of veg stock. Instead of lasagna ,I filled uncooked manicotti with a mix of ricotta and egg. put them in a tray and poured sauce over and baked it. It was amazing. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe, so easy to make too! I used whole wheat lasagna noodles, uncooked, and they turned out great. My husband liked it but it wasn't his "favorite" recipe because the flavor of the artichoke is quite prominent. But, if you like artichoke, you'll LOVE this recipe!

Yum my favorite lasagna now, but I changed it according to the reviews so only 4 stars for the basic idea which is simple enough to alter it to taste without fail.

This was very good. I followed other suggestions and used fresh spinach, less broth, and I also made a ricotta/egg layer. All I did was soak the egg noodles while I did the rest, so no boiling. HOWEVER, I have to say that BECAUSE I did not pre-cook the noodles, I really needed that extra broth and could have used additional tomato or alfredo sauce. My lasagna was a tad dry. So, if you are going to skip boiling noodles, keep the broth and add about an extra 10-15 ounces of sauce. It will be perfect!!! Thanks for a great recipe.

The only change that I made to the original recipe was that I didn't precook the lasagna noodles, and I used whole wheat noodles.  The vegetable broth and artichoke taste is overwhelming and not to my liking.  The lasagna has a vinigary taste.  Although I do not find it to be to watery and I do like the feta cheese on top.  I'm looking for vegetable lasagna to replace my usual meat one once in a while.  I'll keep looking.

I was not expecting to like this but this came out pretty well.  The only substitutes I used were 1/2 c of chicken broth and just a few dashes of dried rosemary because that's all I had.

This turned out great. I did add ricotta to the mix only b/c it was about to go bad but other than that the recipe is great as is:) The only thing I'd suggest is to make sure you cover the top noodles with enough sauce. I spaced out and didn't cover it completely and it turned out a bit crispy at the edges (last I checked, lasagna isn't meant to be crispy) HA! Thanks for the recipe. My friend's have faith in me now.

Excellent. Use 1/2 cup of chix broth as suggested.  Used a full 16oz bag of frozen spinach and would do so again.  Used only 12oz of artichokes but I"m not a huge marinated artichoke fan.

I made this for my sister-in-law who just had a baby. She is a vegetarian and loved it! I thought it was pretty good but it was a little runny, even after taking the advice of others who recommended cutting down the vegetable broth. I also used whole wheat lasagna noodles, and used low fat ricotta instead of feta for a creamier taste! It felt like it took forever to make though!!

This recipe hardly needs any more reviews! I've made it twice in December and delicious both times.  What makes it particularly good is that it isn't laden with cheese so you don't feel like you have lead in your stomach when you are done dinner.  The artichoke flavor is nice and comes through consistently.  I've made it as written and also modified it to double the spinach and add mushrooms.  Next time I'll double the artichokes.  A crowd pleaser.  Highly recommend.

I made this last night. It was way easier than a roasted veggie lasagna I make from the Joy of Cooking. I gave it 4 stars b/c it was very good, and easy but it wasn't quite as tasty as the one in Joy.

I used frozen spinach, no bake noodles, 2 cans of artichoke hearts (double, not marinated), some fresh parsley and parm. ch too. I finished with a few bread crumbs on top too. I did not have any issues with it being watery and I didn't think it was overly cheesy. I will make this again, loved that it was pretty quick.

This was a great lasagna to start with, but as previous reviewers said it was a bit too watery. I added a layer of diced tomatoes in between the artichoke layer, to which I also added some mushrooms. I also omitted the rosemary and used parsley, basil, and oregano (and S&P). My friend made this another night with the ricotta layer and she said it was amazing. While my lasagna was a bit soupy, probably from having used fresh spinach and too much of the oil from the artichokes, it soaked up the liquid the next day or so. Regardless of how soupy it was, it was delicious. I will be making some changes so that I don't end up with lasagna soup, but I found it to be very enjoyable. The flavours were great. Maybe I'll cut the Mozzarella cheese down a bit as I found it a bit too cheesy.

Made the same night as Bob's Awesome Lasagna from Allrecipes.  This won, hands down, with everyone, including meat-eating men.  I added baby portabellas, cottage/cheese egg mixture, a little half and half, fresh spinach at the last minute, and homemade marinara.  Excellent!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was wonderful. I used the no-boil lasagna noodles, but otherwise followed the recipe. It did not turn out watery at all and was very filling and a nice change over the traditional lasagna. I would definitely make this again.

I gave it 4 stars only because it was very time consuming to make! But very delicious!  Here's a tip: Buy lasagna noodles that have already been cooked - it saves time and you don't have to do the first step.  Also, parmasean makes a great substitute! ;)

Great recipe. I used low-carb noodles, reduced fat Feta and 2 cups part-skim Mozzarella cheese to make it a bit lighter and it was fabulous. I was nervous about the "soupiness" of the mixture when it went into the oven, but it came out perfectly creamy.

I did cut amount of marinated artichokes in half (5 oz jar) as I find the flavor can be a bit too over powering & I'm glad I did. It was just the right amount for us. To increase the artichoke I also used a 14 oz can of plain quartered artichokes drained and chopped. I doubled the spinach and added 8 oz sliced mushrooms drained. I added provolone in place of the feta as my daughter & son-in-law do not like feta. I did not pre-cook noodles, as other reviewers had suggested, and the lasagna was not watery and held together nicely. I think I will add drained ricotta next time, as well.

A little bland.  I'd sub a layer of mozzarella for a second layer of feta and cut back the red sauce next time.

SO good!!! I used noodles that didn't need to be boiled and even though the sauce was very watery it was absorbed by the noodles perfectly!! The flavor is great! I used fresh spinach and just steamed it :) 
*** and this is only the third dish I've ever cooked and it was so simple!

I can't cook to save my life but somehow mastered this one!  The first time I made it I used fresh spinach, fresh garlic, and sun dried tomato feta instead of the garlic and herb.  I used a little extra sauce and uncooked, regular lasagna noodles as others have recommended.  I skipped the rosmary and instead used a random herb blend I had in my cupboard. It turned out incredibly good.   Then I had some ingredients left over so I made another a week later with some more variations.  I used frozen spinach, skipped the atrichokes, used pre-minced garlic (the kind from your spice rack) and a little extra vegetable broth.  I thought since I wasn't using as fresh of ingredients it wouldn't be as good, but somehow it turned out even better!  Although since I skipped the artichokes I used extra spinach and I don't think I'd use extra spinach again.  Both versions were better the next day than fresh out of the oven.  Was perfect to take to lunch all week!

I have made this a few times now and have been happy with it. It takes a little bit of time, but is worth it. I am making Thanksgiving dinner this year and my boyfriend asked me to make this (we are vegetarian). To my surprise, my meat eating family members just called and asked me to make it.

Delicious.  Followed exactly except I used Chicken broth instead of Vegetable broth and I diced up one fresh tomatoe and added that to the mixture.  Would make again definitely.

Yum!  I followed the popular suggestions.  Once the filling was ready I was definitely worried about it being soupy.  But I used the no-boil noodles and it turned out perfect.  I assume those noodles absorb the excess liquid and the cooking time thickens it.  Anyway - I served this alongside a traditional lasagna and this was just as popular.  A very nice alternative!

Good recipe.  Only changes I made were using homemade pasta sauce I canned with my gardent tomatoes, using lower fat cheeses and adding in a little low fat ricotta for additional creaminess in the layers.  Also a few chopped black olives.

This recipe is amazing and hearty!  In anticipation of it being runny, I made some changes.  I cut the broth in 1/2, used less tomato sauce (I used the Traditional Ragu in the jar...one jar was perfect!), and used 8oz. of fresh, chopped spinach instead of frozen.  I also couldn't find any garlic and herb feta, so I mixed in some chopped fresh basil and 3 chopped garlic cloves to some plain feta cheese.  I substituted fresh basil in place of rosemary.  It ended up being one of those plastic packs of fresh basil you can get at the grocery stores, chopped...1 TBLS in the spinach mix and the rest in the feta cheese.  I recommend that your first layer be noodles (I cooked mine al dente) so that it helps absorb any liquid.  I threw about 1 tsp. of dried oregano into the spinach mixture, too.  My family (picky kids included) LOVED this lasagna.  Perfect for a vegetarian night.

I made this recipe as-is and found it to be a great vegetarian version of one of my favorite meals. I did find it to be a little watery, but it was perfect the next day for reheating. Next time, I will try using only 3/4 of the suggested vegetable broth, and i may substitute the feta cheese for parmesan as a topping. Overall, delicious recipe and relatively easy to put together quickly!

This is one of my favourite recipes ever. I love the combination of artichokes, spinach, and feta, and this is probably the ultimate way to do it. It was fairly easy, and sooo delicious. My mom and I made it once for a holiday supper and everyone who dared to try it loved it.

This was absolutely delicious! Added more sauce, did not cook the noodles as others advised, used 1/2 the broth and added a a little feta to each layer!

This was easy to make - I put together the night before so we could throw in the oven to cook.  Used the no bake noodles and it turned out great.  My husband has been raving about the leftovers too.

This turned out just wonderful. Would highly recommend!  Added a little more garlic than it called for along with fresh basil, oregano and red pepper flakes to zip it up a little more. My husband just loved it and so did I!  Will absolutely make again - soon!

I replaced rosemary with basil, tomato sauce with alfredo (one jar plus 3/4 water), and added ricotta while layering.  It was excellent, but a little wet.  Will cut down on the water next time.  Still very good!  A little expensive to make, though.

This was a recipe that we were slightly unsure of, but wound up loving.  We omitted the rosemary since we are not big fans of it an added a little more garlic.  We are changing our diet to vegetarian and this is a meal that will become a regular.

This dish is a unique twist on spinach lasagna but the lack of ricotta and addition of artichoke turned out nicely. I used whole wheat cooked noodles, 3/4 C of broth, 1 jar of 3 cheese tomato sauce, 1/2 jar of vegetable tomato sauce, and a couple backs of the italian mixed shredded cheese. It wasn't too watery or anything like I read in the other reviews and turned out perfectly, the extra little sauce was good.

Been going meatless for the last few weeks and decided to give this recipe a try.  I absolutely love lasagna and any pasta dish for that matter but my husband isn't so fond.  I'd never cooked with artichoke before but love spinach artichoke dip! lol! Anyways, so I made this and I loved it!  We had it for dinner 2 nights and I had it for lunch 3-4 days!  Had to finish it!  I didn't use all the vegetable broth, alittle more than half.  Didn't cook the noodles done, only boiled for like 6 mins and turned out perfect.  This wasn't watery or mushy as some users said.  I didn't use feta cheese but I did add a can of chopped mushrooms to the sauce mixture.  I think if I made this again I might would add two layers of ricotta cheese in between.  Great dish though!

Tasty. The kids didn't enjoy it as much as it sounds like some of the other reviewers children did but the ate some of it anyway. I loved it. Like other reviewers I didn't boil the noodles before baking and it came out perfect. Fully agree that boiling would have made much too watery!

My boyfriend liked  this alot. My office manager went crazy for it. Used olive oil instead of cooking spray, used fresh spinach, and drained the mixture before adding the sauce. I used sundried tomato Alfedo sauce and it came out delicious!

Very delicious recipe.  I definitely recommend using no boil noodles - I did and my lasagna turned out just right, moist but not watery.

This was pretty good! I halved the recipe since I didn't need that much, and it worked well. I used the no boil noodles, and fresh spinach. It was pretty good, but I think next time I might go with the alfredo sauce!

I really enjoyed this, I followed it exact except I used dried rosemary, and made one layer of my noodles whole grain.  (I'm trying to eat healthier)  I would make this again!

My husband really liked this recipe.  I diced up some chicken and put it in there along with a layer of ricotta cheese (with egg, mozzarella cheese and parsley).  I also used extra tomato sauce.  Good stuff!

I was expecting more from this lasagna. A good "no meat lasagna" but I think more cheese would improve this. Easy to do, especially since I did not cook the noodles first. This would have been way too soupy if the noodles were cooked first. I used fresh spinach and whole wheat lasagna noodles. I reduced the rosemary by half and was glad I did.

Very good recipe.  I made a few modifications to suit my tastes though.  I sauteed the onion and garlic along with a couple cups of sliced mushrooms.  I omitted the rosemary since I find it can overpower the flavors and instead added a couple tablespoons each of chopped fresh basil and oregano into the sautee mixture at the end along with two bags of well drained frozen chopped spinach.  I decided to add some ricotta to the spinach/artichoke mixture too, 1 large container.  I also doubled the artichoke hearts to two jars since they are one of my favorites.  Used no boil lasagna noodles and about a jar and a half of some good quality marinara sauce I found at the store, plus added some asiago and romano cheese (about a cup each)along with the mozzarella as well as omitting the feta since I don't care much for it.  It came out incredibly and my girlfriend is still raving about it and asking me to make it again.

My husband made this when a few friends came over and they absolutely loved it too, even after initially complaining about our lack of meat. It was so delicious and very filling. Good balance of cheese and sauce. It even opened my husband up a little more to feta, which has been a tough transition for him. Poor guy, didn't know what he was missing.

Very nice!  I made exactly as stated, with the exception of not using jarred tomato sauce - I used 3.5C of the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site instead.  I had concerns that the feta flavor would be overwhelming, but it really tasted great with the spinach and artichokes.  The artichoke mixture was slightly watery at assembly, but after baking, not watery at all.  Very tasty!

Great recipe base + lots of good advice in the reviews = a delicious lasagna my friends loved.  My changes due to ingredients on hand and time constraints were: 1.) didn’t bother cooking the noodles, minced garlic to save chopping time, chicken broth instead of veggie, Italian seasoning 1T instead of rosemary, chopped fresh spinach instead of frozen, non-marinated artichoke hearts, small can of chopped mushrooms, 3 sm jars of alfredo sauce (1 four cheese, 1 w/ roasted garlic, 1 with mushrooms).  Layered as directed and baked for recommended time.  Delicious, creamy and very appreciated.  Thanks to all for the recipe and suggestions.

This is a good recipe, but I found it a bit bland.  Next time I make it, I will be using less onion and adding in mushrooms.  I will also try ricotta cheese instead of mozzarella as a filling and use more herbs than just rosemary.

This is now a regular in my kitchen. I have added mushrooms and cut down on the broth. I also made sure to really squeeze out the spinach. Great with a salad and crusty bread. My kids even like this one.

This turned out awesome, but I only gave it 4 stars instead of five since I made some modifications. I used only alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce. It was amazing. I used Bertolli alfredo sauce. Also, I used a mozzarella/parm blend which was great. I omitted the feta on top since I'm not a fan. Also, I added a lot of spices to the spinach/artichoke mixture including garlic salt, onion powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, herbs de provence, celery salt, and a little poultry seasoning (just b/c I had it on hand). I just wanted to make sure it didn't turn out bland...as other reviewers had mentioned. It was great. Made it for company and the whole thing disappeared. Will definitely make again but never with tomato sauce.

This is by far the best veggie lasagna i have had, EVERY time i make it not one person leaves without asking for the recipe. i saw one comment that it is to watery,  leave the bottom 3 noodles un- boiled and that seems to help.

I used about 20% less cheese 30% less broth, and it was delicious.  My tomato sauce was almost a paste, so I scaled back on that a little too.  I also replaced the mozzarella with ricotta.  Didn't have any artichokes so I skipped that part.  Next time I make this I will add some zucchini.

This was pretty good.  As other reviewers said it ended up watery on the bottom for some reason, so I would leave out the broth, and maybe just add some salt and pepper for flavoring.  It needed a lot more sauce than stated to prevent the noodles from drying out.  It tasted quite good however, it was nice to have a different kind of lasagna.

Four and a half stars.  Excellent dish. We are not vegetarians, but I cook a meatless meal once a week and this is one of the best vegetarian meals on this site.  I use "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site instead of a jar of sauce.I also cook down the sauce/spinach/artichoke mixture 20 min. before assembling the lasagna.  I subbed chicken broth for veg broth.

Great recipe, everyone who tried it raved about it :). I did change a few things. First, i took 1 1/2 lbs. chicken breast, chopped to small bits, and browned with onions garlic and 1/2 tsp. rosemary, and made it an layer. I used the suggestion of another review to include a ricotta layer in there (1 lb. ricotta, 1 egg, parsley, salt and pepper). I cut the rosemary in the sauce preparation down to one tsp, and used vodka sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. But overall, a really good take on lasagna with a pan-mediteranean feel to it.

I followed the recipe as is, and it was absolutely delicious.  I made sure to drain the artichokes and spinach really well (using a potatoe ricer) and it was not as liquidy as some of the reviewers had mentioned.

I made this recipe exactly as written only I used Oven Ready Lasagna noodles--crossed my fingers hoping all the watery sauce would be enough to cook them and it worked.  Whole family absolutely loved this one.  Thanks for sharing--definitely keeping this one around.

I rated this recipe as a 4 because I was not big on the Rosemary in it, but, my husband really liked it.  Tonight I decided to make it again but I did things a little differently since I didn't have spinach.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in about 1TBLSP of the artichoke marinade.  I then added the artichokes, added 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 29oz can of tomato sauce.  I added basil, oregano, parsley, and some white sugar.  I also added 1/2 cup of water in place of the vegetable broth because I didn't have any.  I alternated the tomato sauce with the noodles, mozarella cheese, and parmesan cheese.  I didn't have any feta cheese either.  It turned out awesome!  My husband and my 2 kids ages 2 and 4 devoured it.  I know this is a little bit different of a recipe but this was a great base to start from.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was wonderful!  Some changes I made was I did not cook the noodles first, and they were perfect.  There is more than enough moisture in there too cook them.  I used savory instead of rosemary, and I added zucchini, mushrooms and a layer of Ricotta.  And I used more lasagna noodles, as each layer was not totally covered with the amount of noodles they suggested.  What a great recipe.  You can add so many things, including meat and it would still be great.

Husband asked if I made it or bought it...that's how good it was.  Didn't have the artichokes, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I think that the next time I make it I will double the recipe of bka it in a smaller dish.  It turned out very skinny.

I love the idea of putting artichokes & spinach together in a lasagna, so I had high hopes for this recipe.  However I found it to be a little lacking.  I think perhaps it needed more seasoning and a ricotta or cottage cheese filling.  My family & I thought it was just okay.

This was a very easy and flavorful dish.  My husband loved it and he isn't always a spinach and artichoke man.  I even made it for some friends who are new parents and they raved about it as well.  I think if you wanted to add some sausage or meaty sauce it would be just as good.  ENJOY!

this was a great alternative to traditional lasagna. my family loved it! i added ricotta and used no boil noodles. i also added about 2 tablespoons flour to the onion/spinach/artichoke/broth/sauce mixture (before i added it to the pan) because it just looked so watery. next time i will make it with a cream sauce instead of a tomato.

Yum!!!  Loved this recipe.  I followed it to the letter.  I ran out of sauce/ artichoke spinach mixture so I had to top my lasagna with additional pasta sauce.  Next time I'll use about 14 oz more than the recipe calls for.

I made this for a non-traditional Christmas dinner and it was pretty good. I learned that I do like my lasagne to be very cheesy and I missed the ricotta, so next time I would add that. Other than wanting to chaneg the cheese it was great.

I served this during a Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge hit.  I made the spinach and artichoke mixture as instructed with the exception of using 1/2 alfredo sauce and 1/2 tomato sauce.  I did not make lasagna though.  I turned this into a baked ziti by mixing the sauce with 1 lb of cooked ziti noodles.  I layered the ziti mixture with the mozzarella cheese in a 9x13 baking dish and topped it with the feta cheese and more mozzarella.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a fantastic recipe! No one minded there was no meat in our meal. I substituted basil for the rosemary too. I also used more feta cheese in there too in each layer. Next time I'll add kalamata olives, I think that will make it even better! Because there's so much liquid, I didn't cook the noodles either, which makes it a one-pan meal! Update: Made this last night using hearts of palm instead of artichoke hearts, and goat cheese instead of feta. Best one I've made yet!

I have been making this dish for Christmas for the past 5 years. It is absolutely a crowd pleaser.  Instead of using cooking spray I use Olive Oil and I also use Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce instead of red pasta sauce. I love love love it.

This was really good. I only had water-packed artichokes, so that is what I used. It would be better with the marinated.

Probably a 3.5- meaning it was okay but don't want it too often.  I think it was more like a 4 and a nice change.  I added some finely chopped leftover Pistachio Chicken.

Fantastic. I added in red pepper, zucchini and mushrooms in addition to the artichokes and spinach. I also added in a teaspoon of oregano along with rosemary.

I was very excited to see a recipe like this. I love artichokes and spinach. I am vegetarian but made this for two meat-eaters. They loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. For sure a favorite. They only thing i did different was use only 2 cups of shredded cheese because its all i had on hand. Thx for the recipe!!

I loved this recipe! Having read other reviewers' posts, I only added half the veg broth at first, but through all the simmering, found that I actually needed to add the rest of it. This one is definitely a keeper!

maybe my expectations were too high, but this recipe didn't knock my socks off. i think next time i'll add more spinach and artichokes (the sauce seemed pretty light) and try experimenting with a pesto or light alfredo sauce instead of tomato. we'll see.

I added extra garlic because we love it.  I added the marinade from the artichokes to the sauce and used 35 oz of tomato sauce total.  I did NOT cook the pasta (it was just regular lasagna, not no-cook).  Mine was not soggy at all and it got rave reviews.  All the tomato sauce was a little hard on my acid reflux though :-/

I amde this although I really do not prefer artichokes- but wanted to try to like them. IT WAS VERY GOOD. I would not make it again bc I did notice the artickoes in it, and prefer not to have them- but still it was a good recipe. I loved the feta cheese!

We thought it was Okay. Next time I would add less fresh rosemary and another package of spinach. Mushrooms would also be great next time.

I also just soaked the lasagna noodles and used a bit less liquid.  This was a fantastic meal that was easily reheated the next day!

This lasagna is awesome! Especially for a vegetarian dish. I added pine nuts and flax seeds to the sauce and substituted Italian seasoning for the rosemary. I also used half Italian-blend cheeses and half mozzarella. My husband said I can make it ANY TIME. =) Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe will be added to our rotation.  I am trying to do more vegetarian meals and this was pretty easy to make.  I did not have all of the ingredients available so I had to use dried minced onion instead of fresh (mine were becoming plants), our rural Super Walmart only has plain Feta, and instead of frozen spinach I chopped fresh spinach that was about to go bad.  And I always use no-boil noodles, which made this a do-able weeknight meal.  I only used 8oz of part-skim mozzerella, but used my whole 8oz container of Feta.  This recipe is very forgiving of substitutions.  Next time I think I will use Bleu Cheese instead of the Feta to see how it tastes.

We LOVED this but is loses about a 1/2 a star because it is so salty.  I think next time I will leave most of the Feta off altogether and rinse the artichokes well.  That should help at least a little with the salt.  Other than that, it was delicious and SO easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

I made many changes: Fresh spinach, basil instead of the rosemary, added chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth and used only half of the amount called for. I bought the rose sauce at Costco and used the whole litre. I used Barilla Callizone lasagna pre-cooked lasagna,,they are rectangle noodles. They are the best..no cooking, no dirty pans and they taste great!!! So easy and simple and so good!!!! This is a lasagna where you can almost add whatever you want. One time I added fresh mushrooms, another time was red and yellow peppers. I have never tried it with tomatoe sauce, but I will definetly give it a try.

Loved it, and the kids loved it.  Bonus: it is super easy.  I used whole wheat noodles.  If you use the bag of chopped frozen spinach and not the block you don't even have to thaw it and drain the water, just toss the frozen spinach into the sauce as you cook it.

This is great. Such simple ingredients with such a huge taste. I only used 1 cup of broth (due to previous reviews), but I think I will reduce it to less- maybe 3/4 cup because it was still very wet. I must not have drained the spinach & artichokes enough. The only changes I made were: I used whole wheat lasagna noodles, 1/2 tbsp rosemary, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar & regular feta.   Also, this made way more than 8 regular sized servings!! It made double that... I couldn't imagine splitting one full size lasagna with 8 people, especially with vegetable sides & bread. We really need to rethink our portion sizes in the US... Anyway I'll definitely make this next time we have a lot of people over.

My boyfriend is a veg (and im not) so this dish was great for us.  I looked at comments and noticed some people said it was too watery.  i used half a quarter liter of water with a brouillon block mixed in.  We have rosemary and basil growing in our garden so we used that as well.  We found already cooked lasgna noodles in the freezer section of our store and they worked out great.  Tasty and easy dish!

Loved it!!! Even my 21 year old son said to make it again and that he liked it much better than my usual lasagna recipe. I don't think it turned out too soupy at all and the only thing I changed was to used regular canned artichokes instead of the marinated ones.

My family *demolished* this dish -- they couldn't stop raving. I used the full amt of liquid (vegetable broth) but then cooked it down. Figured it might give the veggie filling more flavor. Also dumped in one zucchini and a package of mushrooms, which I think added a good amount of heft. The mixture of mozzarella and feta on top, as well as the artichokes, really gave a great flavor.

Really good. I only gave it 4 stars because I followed others' advice and omitted the veg. broth. If I'd added it, I have a feeling it would've been WAAAAY too soupy. It was perfect without it. Yummy!

Wonderful!  I used lasagna noodles that were "no pre-boil"  and didn't add any of the broth.  Just make sure you cover the noodles with sauce so they cook!  Instead of the broth, I did just add a bit of the juice from the marinated artichokes.  It worked great!  Both the kids loved it too.

This was EXCELLENT!  Only thing I changed was added 6 oz. of tomato paste for thickness, added dash of Italian seasoning and little bit of salt.  It was soooooo good!  Thank you!

This is a nice recipe...I made two versions for a dinner party, one as originally posted and another with ricotta added as other reviewers recommended.  I had some friends who were not ricotta fans, so they appreciated the choice and everyone raved about the taste.

I really really liked this!  I did add the ricotta mixture as other reviews suggested, and I enhanced both that and the tomato sauce with some sun-dried tomato pesto.   I used whole wheat no-boil noodles and they turned out perfect.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent and a big hit in my house. I used fresh baby spinach and no cook noodles. When I took the Mozzarella out I realised I'd mistakenly bought a mozzarella/cheddar mix so used that instead. I also cut down on the feta cheese slightly. This looked beautiful when it came out of the oven and tasted even better. Definitely a family favourite. Thankyou so much.

It has alot of flavor for a veggie lasagna!  I used no-boil noodles, fresh spinach & added ricotta cheese(mixed w/egg and fresh basil & oregano) and it was delicious!!!  I also cooked an extra 10 min uncovered to get rid of the extra juice.  Delightful!

This was SOOOO good! I think boiling the spinach & artichokes really helped tone down the 'artichoky' taste. Loved it, will make again!

Very Good but noting exceptional about it.  I'd cook it again because it's relatively cheap and very easy... but probably not for guests.

We loved this recipe.  With the exception of using no-boil noodles and being heavy-handed with the cheeses, I followed the recipe exactly.  The smell while this was cooking was absolutely divine.  The is the best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had.  (And my husband is not a huge fan of ricotta cheese so to find a recipe for lasagna without ricotta is a bonus!) Outstanding!

very good, very easy.  Use only 6-8oz of broth (I used chicken broth) and more mozzerella cheese.  I used uncooked noodles and it turned out fine.

This recipe is outstanding.  I had a party with a couple of vegetarians and I did not know what to prepare.  Found this recipe and it was delicious.  I am making it again tomorrow!  Filling, tasty, everyone wanted seconds.

As a novice cook who'd never made a lasagna before, I found this fairly uncomplicated to make. I did as others suggested and cut back on the liquids, and I also added ricotta cheese to every layer. It turned out great, and everyone at the dinner party loved it. I only give it four stars because buying a lot of the ingredients was so expensive!

My husband was a fan...I thought it was okay.  I did use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Also used organic ingredients-of which I did not like the sauce I used.

Good, pretty easy to make. My husband and brother both thought it was good (for having spinach in it). I thought it needed a bit more flavor. Is NOT good the next day. It got soggy and mush overnight.

I made this lasagna as part of our Christmas dinner and it was a big hit with my family!  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh, vegetable bouillon dissolved in water for the broth, and low-fat mozzarella cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I also used plain feta cheese, but added some garlic powder and a little Italian herb seasoning.  The result was a delicious vegetarian lasagna.  I think it might also taste good if you substituted a prepared alfredo sauce for the marinara sauce (although that would definitely increase the calorie count).

I brought this to a Christmas potluck dinner and people couldn't stop raving about it...Like the others who've reviewed this, I think cutting back on the vegetable stock by 1/2 is a good suggestion.  I was hoping to bring home leftovers, but this was gobbled up so quickly that now I think I need to make some more SOON!

This was a really delicious lasagna! I used whole wheat pasta and added a few dollops of ricotta cheese on top of the mozzarella layer, which made it really good! As a personal preference I would use about half the rosemary called for in the recipe.

Let me start by advising that everyone in my family was skeptical about this recipe. Atrichoke? Spinach? Ewwww! :) But, me being the experimental type, stuck to my guns and made it anyway. It was a success! Even with their negative expectations, they liked it, even my 1 year old. Everyone went back for seconds. I would definitely make it again. This time, my family won't give me such a hard time.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It was a hit!  I mixes the spinach, artichokes and freshh rosemary and parsley with fat free ricotta cheese and fat free cottage cheese and used it between the layers of lasanga.  I also used a bottle of pasta sauce with the layers along with cheese.  I used the non-cook lasanga noodles and assembled it the night before.  it was great.

What an amazing Lasagna! This was my first shot at making lasagna and it was delicious! This recipe isn't getting rave reviews for nothing! It's also very versatile- you can easily incorporate other ingredients to make it to your liking, or do the same by limiting or omitting others. The feta cheese added a great zing to it. I think next time I'll add black olives and experiment with the pasta sauce! I'm bring this over for Christmas-eve!

I substituted kale for the spinach, and chevre for the feta. It was tasty, but like so many before, I found it very liquid. I'll probalbly make it again, but I'll omit the soup stock. With the tomato sauce, it was probably wet enough.
I also did not pre-boil the noodles, which is a good thing because they would have been kindergarten paste! With a little tweaking, this will be a great dish.

This is a great recipe and makes a delicious meal!!  After reading some reviews, I opted to leave out the veg broth... I substituted dried Italian seasoning instead of the fresh rosemary and used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I used one 26oz jar of roasted garlic tomato pasta sauce and added in about 3/4 of whipping cream.  The consistency was perfect - next time I plan to add chopped zucchini!

Made this delicious recipe last night and everyone loved it.  I used the "best marinara sauce" recipe instead of store bought spaghetti sauce and also added parmasean cheese with the mozarella cheese.  I assembled it earlier in the day and took out about 30 minutes before putting into the oven.  The cooking time was still the same as the directions.  Will be making this again and might make it with italian sausage next time too.  Thanks for this great recipe!

All in all a really good recipe.  I did make some changes though.  I did not use marinated artichokes since I don't like the oily taste.  I used the plain canned artichokes. I forgot to buy vegetable broth so I used the remaining liquid from the canned artichokes and some of the water from the pasta.  I also added basil because I love basil.

YUM! I love this recipe! Family and friends always rave when I bring it to potlucks. I have used jack cheese in place of the mozzarella and it tastes fabulous! Definately worth the effort  =)

Love this lasagna - everyone asks for the recipe.  I double the tomato sauce and don't preboil the noodles.  It's great for office potlucks.

I've made this several times. Even my friends who don't like veggies or feta will eat this. I'm not a big fan of rosemary but this lasagna is still amazingly good.

Delicious! I made it exactly as written and it turned out just right (not too liquidy at all). I was a bit worried that there wasn't enough filling, but once it was done it was perfect! I'm making it again for company this weekend!

This lasagna is fantastic! After reading some reviews, I used about half as much broth, slightly less pasta sauce, and mixed ricotta with the mozzarella. Everything came out perfectly.

This was really good! Even my meatlovin' husband liked it. The "no boil" lasagna noodles were less hassle. We didn't have regular onion so I had to use green onion instead. I only had 2 cups of mozzarella but with the feta it was fine. I'll definately make this again!

This was delicious.  I even used regular uncooked lasagna noodles and they ended up tasting like they were boiled!  I also substituted 1 tsp. dried rosemary for the fresh, used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen, used a jar of alfredo sauce instead of tomato, used two cups of lowfat mozarella, not 3, AND used low-fat feta.  I know, I know the alfredo sauce negated all the lowfat cheese, but man was it good.  This is a KEEPER!

Awesome recipe! I love that this is vegetarian. I added a can of mushrooms and only used 2 10oz. jars of tomato pasta sauce because that's all I had. Also, like others suggested, I didn't boil the lasagna noodles first. I used tomato basil feta because I couldn't find the kind the recipe called for but I don't think it really matters much. Try it, it's really delicious.

I think this lasagna is even better than the traditional one.  Great blend of flavors.  Even my picky kids loved it.  If I were to change anything, maybe a tad less broth.

My boyfriend went crazy for this lasagna and tells everyone we know that they need to get the recipe from me. Next time I am going to add extra garlic, onion, and portobello mushrooms, and may try whole wheat lasagna noodles.  Might mix in some ricotta too.  Makes great left overs, by the way, hot or cold. Definitely a keeper!

This was so good.  Used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I only got 2 of each layers, but I think I was assembling the layers thicker than intended.  Made great leftovers, too.

Everyone at my office loved it, but I was not a big fan.  It was just okay - nothing fantastic.  And the fresh rosemary was a little overwhelming on top of the other flavors.  It wasn't bad, it's just something I would make again.

This was a good lasagna recipe.  I used ricotta instead of feta, used unbaked noodles, have a can of chicken broth, and half a jar of artichoke hearts.  I will be making this again maybe with the feta next time.

This was so so good, and really easy to prepare.  The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of broth.  The lasagna was a bit too runny for my tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent dish.  I followed previous reviewers's recommendation to cut back on the broth to avoid a runny lasagna and this worked well.  I needed more mozz cheese than recommended by the recipe.

I'm not a big fan of lasagna; however, this was so good that I couldn't stop eating it!  Leftovers heated in the microwave seemed even better.  In fact, I finished this off last night around 11PM!

This turned out really well, but I did make some changes. I used less broth than called for and used chicken instead of veggie, and also added some cooked shredded chicken and mushrooms, and used (extra) homemade sauce.  I'm betting the leftovers tonight will be even better.  Thanks for the recipe.

Took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. I rated it 4 stars because I did change a few things. I used mini lasagne noodles and didnt cook them first, sauteed my onions and garlic in a little olive oil, used one and a half TBSP dried italian seasoning instead of the rosemary, used only half a can of chicken broth,not sure if you really need any broth, and topped it with fresh parm., instead of feta. I used an 11x7 pan and only did 2 layers. I will make this again soon.

This is a great recipe. It was my first time trying it and it came out fantastic. The whole family loved it. I did, however, use chicken broth instead of vegetable, because that's what I had. I also sauted the onion, garlic, etc. for a little longer than the recipe calls for. It's also a good idea to lightly coat the lasagna noodles in olive oil after they have been cooked, otherwise they will stick together while the onion, garlic, spinach, and artichoke are being sauteed.

we were not fans of this lasagna.  it could have been chef's error, but there was an overwhelming taste of spinach.  I think if I decide to make it again i will use much less spinach

This was delicious. The artichoke/spinach mixture complemented the lasagna fairly well. Like other reviewers, I omitted the vegetable broth for fear that it would turn out too watery. Luckily, it worked out. I also sauteed my vegetables in extra-virgin olive oil because I am not too fond of cooking spray. All in all this recipe is a keeper!

Looked great, smelled great, but there was something off about the taste.  Had to assault it with extra sauce and ricotta to eat it. I'll make this again, but not with the marinated artichokes- they don't quite fit in here.

Delicious and easy to assemble!  I sauteed sliced crimini mushrooms along with the onions to give the dish some heft.  My normally meat-loving husband gave this dish a big thumbs up!

Awesome.  Absolutely amazing.  I had no problems with it being watery like others complained of.  I used no-cook noodles, and I think that might have helped.  I plan on making it again with the addition of some chicken, but it was amazing even as is!

My husband says this is the best dish I make.  I add some shredded roasted chicken, use jarred spaghetti sauce and alfredo sauce (to make it a creamy pink sauce), and also use a layer of ricotta mixed with italian seasoning and parmesan.

Delicious!  My first attempt at making lasagna of any kind and it was terrific!  Way easier than I had imagined and this recipe is perfect for me since I don't care for the ricotta cheese, etc in usual lasagna.  I love veggies, so I added some of my own - mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, etc and it was awesome!  Thanks!
Updt 1/2015 - made per recipe but used prepared alfredo sauce instead and added extra veggies.  Delicious!

DELICIOUS!! I made this for our anniversary dinner-coupling one of my favorites (lasagna) with one of my husband's favorites (spinach). Now we both have a new favorite! I doubt I'll go back to "normal" lasagna. Try this one even if you don't like artichokes!

I've made this lots and we just love it!  I double the mozzarella (a must) use regular canned artichoke hearts (not marinated), use tomato basil feta if available, and use dried rosemary chopped finely (instead of fresh).  I've not had a problem with mushy cooked lasagne noodles like some others have experienced.  I guess the broth could be cut down, but you can just use a slotted spoon when assembling to minimize runniness.  As a rule, lasagne needs time to sit (at least 10 minutes) before serving, so that helps.  One thing that I think is VERY important is your choice of marinara. I will not ever use store marinara sauce (not even Rao's!) since finding the most fresh and delicious recipe on allrecipes called Best Marinara Sauce Yet. Choose your marinara wisely and you will just love this recipe, or any other that calls for marinara as part of it.

I thought this was a really nice vegetarian change from my usual meat filled menu.  My boyfriend still complained that there was no meat, yet he wolfed it down.  The rosemary flavor was a little too strong for me.  I used a tbs of dried... next time I will cut it down to 1/2 and grind it so there are not such big chunks. Otherwise a great and versatile recipe! I might try it with some meat next time...

My partner and I agreed that this recipe was a fun alternative to more traditional lasagnas.  I didn't add the broth or all of the cheese, and it was the right consistency anyway.   In the future I'll use higher quality artichoke hearts; the canned ones aren't nearly as nice as the ones you get at a high-end deli counter.

I made changes per other suggestions- did not pre-cook the noodles, used 1 tsp. dried rosemary, used chicken broth (didn't remember to buy or prepare veggie), and it turned out great!  Making it again tonight for a dinner party.

This turned out really great.  I didn't use feta cheese, because I don't like it, instead I used mozzarella.  I also added mushrooms and I used artichokes in water because I didn't have any of the marinated kind on hand.  This lasagna turned out very delicious though, everyone asked for the recipe.

Really good and different! I don't use the feta and instead combine the mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan and layer them with the other ing. Next time I may add some alfredo sauce to that mixture for some extra fat and taste. Make sure you drain the spinach well.  I also add mushrooms since they don't overpower and they go well with the combination .Takes a little time but worth it. Another keeper.

This is a very HIGH 3 1/2 stars. We loved everything that was incorporated in this lasagna, but we really like the traditional lasagna. Good...will probably have again, but not on regular rotation.

Delicious. I made some minor alterations: Used whole whwat lasagna noodles, frozen artichoke hearts, double the spinach, tofu mozzarella and hald the called for amount and sun dried tomato feta. I also added a little vegetable broth to the edges of the lasagna pan as I was putting it in the oven as it didn't look very moist. Only change I'll make next time is adding a bit of salt and perhaps some mushrooms.

i loved this recipe! i changed it a bit by   not using veg broth and instead i used red wine which intensified the flavor of the the sweet basil i used instead of rosemary... so good, my hubby & i agree, this is the yummiest lasagna :)

I made this for my boyfriend (a very picky eater) and less than a week later he proposed!  Not only is it delicious, it'll make even the pickiest eater happy!

This was something different. I may try it again, but not with the artichoke hearts.  I did add mushrooms and 1-1/2 cups sauce as others suggested...good call. I also only used 2 cups of mozzarella and parmesan instead of feta.

Very disappointing, and I was hopeful, too.  I basically followed the recipe with a few minor changes and was excited that it would be considered a "core" meal for WW purposes (with my minor changes).  I guess there are some recipes that do not benefit from calorie and fat reduction, and this was one of them.  I even added mushrooms and a layer of FF ricotta.  Oh well.

I was disappointed by this recipe, I hoped that it would be better because of the 5 star rating.  I didnt cook my noodles beforehand and my lasagna was still soupy. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and whole wheat noodles and those were my only changes. I think that it would be better if the vegetable broth was either reduced substantially or elminated totally. It was very runny.

Like a lot of other people, I modified this a bit.  I added mushrooms, added a layer of ricotta (I added parmesan, the spinach & an egg to that), and added some Alfredo sauce into the sauce mixture and as a layer in the middle.  I also used a little goat cheese on top instead of the feta.  This was quite possibly the BEST lasagna I've ever had.  I'll be making it again!!!!

I thought this was alright - a bit too salty for my liking, but my guests really enjoyed it.  I made a few modifications, as suggested by others: I didn't cook my whole-wheat lasagna noodles and I added 2 layers of ricotta (15 oz ricotta + 1 egg + garlic powder).  My bnoodles were perfect - it was not a soupy mess, probably because I hadn't pre-cooked my noodles (they were not no bake).

this lasagna was good, but i made my own alfredo sauce which completely fell apart in the oven & made it a buttery greasy mess.  BUT, i do see the potential & next time i will use store bought sauce!

I made this the other night for the first time and had my in-laws over to try it out.  Everyone, including my 9, 6 and 4 year olds gobbled it up!  BRAVO.  The only thing I might do is add a little less broth to make the lasagne hold together better.

Very good and easy to assemble. I actually made two smaller lasagnes and froze one for later on. It reheated well and will be something that I make again.

i made this for a holiday dinner and it was a hit with vegetarians and carnivores alike. i substituted cut leaf spinach for chopped, to give it more texture, and also subbed parmesan cheese for feta. i ended up pouring off about half of the broth after simmering (before adding the pasta sauce) and it turned out great. i also made it in a 9x9 pan, and had a cup or so of sauce left over after building the lasagna, which i sent home with one of my guests to use over pasta later. thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this four stars because I didn't like it, but certain family members really did.  In all fairness to the recipe though, I didn't follow it exactly.  I took the advice of many others and made quite a few changes.  First...I added sauteed mushrooms (NOT a mistake as they were a great addition).  I also made it in a 9x9 pan to creat a thicker lasagne as I didn't want to double the ingredients.  This also wasn't a bad suggestion as in doing so the lasagne was now as thick as a regular one would have been.  However...I also added a ricotta mixture, and a alfredo sauce, in addition to the red sauce.  To me the alfredo sauce addition made it far too rich, in which case...leaving it in a 9x13 dish might have been the better alternative.  Also...I agree with others that you don't at all miss the meat, however...I did lose the flavor of the artichokes and spinach, which is great if you are trying to 'hide' veggies in there for your family...but if you like the flavor of them, I found they were just lost.  Of course that may also have been because of the alfredo sauce.  All in all, its a good recipe...but will probably need to be made and tweeked a few times to your liking.

Great flavor, but I was a little disappointed in the overall thickness of the slice that resulted from the 13X9 inch pan. Next time, I'll either prepare it in a 9X9 or double the recipe.

Wow! I had the inlaws over to try this with use because the kids don't like lasagne. They could not believe there was no meat in it and my mother-in-law took the recipe home with her! I had two pieces left over which made lunches for my husband and me the next day! What a great lunch!

Very yummy lasagna, I love artichokes.  I used a larger baking dish and just about doubled the ingredients.  Added layers of the ricotta/egg/cheese mixture as recommended in earlier reviews.  Did not cook the artichokes or sauce and each had their own layer.  Used a bottle each of spicy red pepper sauce and spicy tomato basil sauce, so lasagna was slightly spicy.  I didn't pre-cook the regular lasagna noodles, and was afraid it wouldn't cook so added some of the broth before baking, but it bubbled over alot, so next time I won't be adding any extra liquid.  Didn't use the feta, which was fine, just topped it with mozzarella and real parmesan cheese.  Served to my family with salad and fresh garlic bread, and everyone liked the lasagna.  I will definitely make this again and will experiment using cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

This lasagna was delicious and I didn't even include the spinach. I forgot to buy it.  I will make this again!

This was wonderful!!! Very tastey indeed.  I love ricotta with my lasagna, so I used it in the layering process and topped it with motzerella and parmesan, although I am sure motzerella and feta would be great too.  It turned out awesome.  I couldn't really see this recipe without the ricotta, as it really made it fantastic.

I made this recipe for my boyfriends birthday pt luck party.  It was when we first started dating.  Everyone at the party was extreamly impressed by it.  Needless to say, my boyfriend is now my husband.  This recipe must have won him over! hehehehe.  Really good recipe.

This recipe was very delicious.  I made only two changes, I used oven ready noodles and I left out the rosemary.  It turned out really good, but I will try it with the rosemary next time.

FANTASTIC!  Even my fiance who is big on meat sauces loved this one.  I made a mistake, though, by adding additional sauce AND water to cook the noodles (as suggested by other viewers).  It was WAY too soupy, so next time I will omit the water and just put in extra sauce.  While it didn't look too appetizing (because of MY mistake) it tasted absolutely delicious!

This was a very easy, throw together kind of meal but it tastes very yummy.  I took the suggestions from others and did not pre-cook the noodles and it came out great.  I also tried making this with zucchini and it was also fantastic.

this did not turn out very well for me. it had too much onion, and without the ricotta cheese, it was a bit flimsy. if i make this again, i'll definitely make some substitutions.

When looking for a vegetarian lasagna recipe, this blows away the typical zucchini/carrot/etc. versions that are found on every recipe site.  This had a great flavor and wasn't too heavy. Next time I'll leave out the feta as it just wasn't for me.  But other than that, this was dead on.

This recipe was everything each person who rated it, made it out to be. Everyone at my potluck loved it and some asked for the recipe. When I make it again though I think I would add a little extra of both cheeses and maybe some ricotta cheese as well - but made by the recipe was great too!!

This is a hit with everyone I've made it for!  I made it the original way (minus the feta) the first time. I've made small variations along the way: oven-ready lasagna noodles save a lot of time!  I used about 2/3 of canned tomato sauce, 1/3 spaghetti sauce (to thicken and flavor).  I've also added ground chicken before and it was good. For a lower-fat version, I use fat-free ricotta, and then use about 1 cup of mozzarella for the top.

I followed the recipe exactly and the lasagna was cooked right. However, the taste wasn't as spectacular as other reviewers has said though. I will probably make it again because it is quite easy to make.

My store didn't carry herb and garlic feta, I'm
sure that would have made a difference.  Family
ate it without asking what was in it, which was a
good thing:-)  I liked it topped with a little meat sauce and freshly grated parmesan.

This lasagna was absolutely delicious!  My husband thinks he has to have meat at every meal, but he had three helpings of this the first time I made it!  Plain feta works fine, and I replace the onions with onion powder.  Also, I add a can of mushrooms and use Classico's Spicy Tomato & Pesto sauce, which is delicious.  This has become a regular at our house.  YUM!

I used a small onion, and it was still way too much.  The recipe tasted like a big onion.  Otherwise I think it would have been good.

Very simple recipe! Doesn't take nearly as long to make as a meat lasagna does. 
Everyone absolutely loved it! The reheated leftovers were even better. 
Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the amazing recipe!!! =)

I loved this recipe.  I used fresh spinich & homemade macaroni sauce.  It was terrific & filling.  The spinich & artichokes makes it more healthy than plain ole lasagna.

This recipe was good, but not great. The spinach and artichokes kind of get lost in the sauce. Perhaps keeping them as a separate layer might be better. Also, the flavored feta was not the best. Next time I would use plain feta instead, as my husband and I love feta. Might be better with an alfredo as others have tried. Probably won't make this again. At least not how it's written.

Per the reviews, I added 1/2 the recommended vegetable broth.  I added a layer of ricotta mixture.  Minus the artichokes (not a big fan).  & used bottled alfredo sauce.  
Rave reviews, very easy, the nicest looking and tasting lasagna I've ever made.  THANKS

I made this last night and used a bottled alfredo sauce instead of the red sauce.  My husband, who doesn't like traditional lasagna LOVED it. Next time I will reduce the sauce a bit more so it isn't quite as moist. DELICIOUS!!!!

I absolutely adored this.  I think it was a tad bit on the soupy side, but will let the sauce reduce a bit next time should take care of that.  One of the few recipes I don't have to "tweak" to get it just right.  
My husband, however, did not like it.  He is not a spinach fan.  Oh well, he can just fix a sandwich or something the next time I make this!

Yummy!  I made this based on a slightly different recipe...used alfredo sauce instead of tomato, and didn't pre-cook the noodles. I just added a 1/4 cup of water to each end of the pan before baking.  Great recipe! Just like artichoke spinach dip made into lasagna!

This lasagna is incredible! Don't worry about cooking the noodles before you assemble it: there's more than enough stock in the spinach to make them nice and tender. Yum!

used 2/3 cup of chopped onion, 1 herb ox chicken bullion cube with 2/3 cup of water. left out rosemary, used 6oz of fresh spinach, and ragu robusto garlic for the sauce. Couldn't find the herb and garlic feta so I just put fresh grated parmesan. The whole family thought it was excellent. Will make again

I have this exact recipe - except that the recipe in the book uses a jar of Alfredo or Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce rather than a tomato-based sauce. It's KILLER with the Alfredo sauce.

My husband really loved this and I have a tough time getting him to eat veggies! I will add this to our regular list of meals. It was really good.

Fabulous recipe. Make more sauce then the recipe calls for and use less chicken broth

After reading the previous reviews I KNEW this was going to be a good one! This has replaced our old meat-sauce recipe. We thought it was a little too salty so next time will try low sodium broth. Also concerned it might turn out to be watery so I just simmered it a little longer with the lid off to reduce the broth. I like the idea of using the lasagne noodles that don't require pre-cooking--that will make preparation even easier. It was a hit!

This is the first time I've ever cooked with artichokes. My husband and daughter were skeptical at first, but they LOVED it! It's now added to one of our "favorites" lists.

Delicious!  EVERYONE who has tried this has loved it!  The onions add a nice body to the filler (I used red onions), and the artichokes mix great with the fresh rosemary.  One of my favorite veggie lasagnas so far.  Thanks!

Pretty good vegatarian recipe. Loved the feta on top - could not find the garlic and herb so I used regular and it was great.
