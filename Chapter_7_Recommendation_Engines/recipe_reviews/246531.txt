It was sort of meh. Not much flavor. I ended up adding way more jalapeños and juice. Still tastes like warmed up plain velveeta not very nacho-ey .

Made as written except that I added a couple more jalapeno's for more heat. Turns out I should have stuck to just three because my addition made it a little too spicy. Lesson learned. This melted down nicely for me and I really liked the addition of onions. This sauce could be used for many different things and I bet it would be equally good with the blanco Velveeta. Definitely a keeper!

Used 3/4 c milk and 2 tsp cornstarch.  Left out the taco seasoning, etc as I just wanted a cheese sauce for my daughters mac and cheese.  Turned out PERFECT.  Smoothest cheese sauce I have ever made.  This is a keeper!

I was looking for just a plain cheese sauce and I had purchased a block of velveeta to make it, but didn’t yet have a recipe. I found this one so I made it with just the butter, flour, milk and velveeta. It turned out perfectly and I used it to complement the Stauffer’s mac I had heated through as part of our thanksgiving dinner. I will use this base recipe in the future whenever I need to make a quick and delicious cheese sauce.

I haven't made this for a while but I loved it and plan to make it again soon. Good with either nacho chips or veggies.

Let me start out by saying I'm not a big fan of Velveeta Cheese but this one worked. Addictive cheese sauce.

I was going back between 2 and 3 stars because I didn't like it, but 2 out of 6 of my family did. Sooo 4 stars it is. I'll start off by saying we love Velveeta. And love just warming up Velveeta and a little milk in the microwave for a quick Chips and cheese snack. But tonight we were making nachos with ground beef for dinner so I needed something more than just the norm. I read the reviews and most were not liking the whole Velveeta thing, which we like so I went with it. I made it exactly as described and  it was super thick from the flour. If I was to use this recipe again I would either cut the flour at least in half or eliminate it completely. The taste itself was really bland as well do I added about half a cup more milk which did thin it out but i could of done a whole cup and it would of been ok. Still the flavor was too bland. I added more jalepino juice still nothing. I added about a half tablespoon of chili powder and it gave it a little flavor and it was getting late so we served it as is. Everyone ate it but no one had seconds and we tossed the left overs. Won't be making again. But it was very simple to make.

Pretty simple to make.  Used serranos instead of jalapeños for that extra heat :). Not very Nachoey though

Good consistency,  fairly easy and I would make it again with more peppers!
