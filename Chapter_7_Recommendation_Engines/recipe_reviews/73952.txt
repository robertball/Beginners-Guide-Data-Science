In scotland it would really be a good scottish whisky (Scotch) that would be used not rum as suggested. I always add honey, again preferrably heather honey to the cream to give a better flavour. We have fantastic raspberries in scotland and cranachan is a nice way of using them.

I love making this simple dessert for the summer. I leave the rum out for my son and add a little extra for my husband.

This was lovely.  Much lighter taste than you would imagine.  Very quick and easy to make.

I added a little bit of extra sugar and some chocolate chips. It really made a sweet difference. For the whiskey I used Dalwhinnie 15 because it's naturally sweet and it really made it pop

I think I will make it a little less sweet and with reduced flavorings next time.
