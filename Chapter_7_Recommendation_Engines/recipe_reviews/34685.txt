Awesome, awesome, awesome.  I added summer squash and zucchini, used diced tomatoes flavored with sweet onions, and used soy feta and parmesan cheese, and it was sooo good.  My boyfriend and his friend both loved it too!

This recipe had even my picky eaters happy.. soooo yummy! Very easy to prepare but does take a bit of time in the oven.  Trust me, it's worth the wait!

My husband really loved this!  I used diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, so did not add any additional garlic.  I also accidentally bought French feta and it was really quite nice (creamier and a milder flavor).  This is a keeper!

This tasted pretty good, but it was alot better when I mixed some extra cheese into the vegetables.

Thanks!  This was a simple to prepare recipe and was delicious.  Don't hesitate to switch up vegetables.  In addition to several types of peppers, I added mushrooms and cauliflower to the roasted veggies.  Very tasty.

This sounded wonderful but it just didn't cut it at our house. Won't be making again. Such a commitment of time and preparation.

Great recipe but I changed a few things. I added at least 6 cloves of garlic. I used one serrano pepper. I let the veggies roast about 25 minutes. I seasoned them with black pepper and garlic salt. I used a can of diced tomatoes, onion and bell pepper. I mixed the tomato mixture with a can of diced tomatoes, Morning Star Veggie Chicken strips diced up, and a can of cream of mushroom. I poured that on top the roasted veggies then added the feta and some shredded cheddar. Then the puff pastry. I baked it about 30 minutes. The kids loved it. It was called the stuff that taste like pizza and the stuff that is like chicken pot pie. It was a hit with the non-vegetarians. Will make again with my modifications.

Whilst this tastes nice enough it’s definitely not worth the time and effort it takes to make. I didn’t bother doing it upside down. Just put all the ingredients on top of the pastry and baked. If I was to make again I would use store bought char-grilled veges.

We make this recipe often exactly as written, and absolutely love it.  The roasted vegetables taste great, and even though it isn't the quickest recipe out there, it is well worth the time and effort.

This was an extremely easy and delicious snack or as an appetizer.  I will definitely make this again!  I used gorgonzola cheese and it was delish!

Since I'm in a long line of people who love to cook, the prep is easy and i dont understand what everybody is blabbing about. We always add extra cheese (cause i love feta ;)) and the puff pastry just ties it all together, it adds the rich and fluffy flour taste thats needed for a recipe like this with a lot of veggies. We also dont add the chile pepper, but we love it that way :) but as a whole 5 stars. love the recipie

I made this dish as directed - really delicious and easy to prepare, with perfect seasoning. Used a fresh chile pepper and tomatoes from the garden.  I would strongly advise that you NOT flip it for serving. The liquid from the veggies makes the pastry very soggy very quickly. My picture shows it flipped as per the directions but it's s far nicer presentation with the pastry on top. I've given this 5 stars anyway.

I've tried it and it was wonderful.I'll definitely be using the recipe again for myself and veggie friends.  I've spent quite a long time trying to upload a pic but even though I've resized the image so that it IS definitely less than 960x960 pixels, the message keeps coming up that it's too big!

Very nice recipe! I wanted something to test out my home-made puff pastry recipe and this was perfect for that. I used potatoes as well as the recommended pepper mix and so had to roast the veggies a little longer than suggested, about 20 minutes. My wife and I both give this a thumbs-up!

I made this for Christmas.  None of my guests or I enjoyed it.  The puff pastry was nice, but the rest of it was not at all.

Love it...it is so quick and easy to prepare.  We usually use goat cheese instead of feta and add any veggies we have on hand.  We don't turn it out but prepare it in a nice stone baker and serve straight from the stone.

Easy to make and delicious. I did make a few changes - instead of the canned tomatoes, I used freshly diced tomatoes. Also I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added Zuchini and squash.

Delicious! Perfect for a cool autumn evening, and very simple to make.
