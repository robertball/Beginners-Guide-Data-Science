I absolutely love this recipe!!  You can omit the peach jam if you don't have any. I found that it tasted basically the same with or without it. I used the juice from canned peaches.  I didn't really measure the juice just put in everything from the can.  I didn't actually use any solid peach slices in this.  I did not use green onions either.  Instead I used white or yellow onion sliced and put it in the skillet when I added the syrup mixture.

This was really, really good.  I thought it would need more seasoning, but I followed the recipe exactly (except for doubling the sauce) and it was PERFECT!  The pork, curry, peaches, & cilantro compliment each other in such a flavorful way.  My boyfriend insisted on saving the leftover sauce, so a couple days later, I added some shredded chicken to the peach curry sauce and sealed it in a pie crust 'pocket' like a calzone...and that was another superbly delicious meal.  I would rate it higher than 5 stars if I could...thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Made this for 60 people at a church event and everyone loved it!  I used T-Bone center cut pork chops and baked them about 1/2 hour adding the glaze after 20 minutes.  Peaches went on at the very end and I garnished it with the green onions and no cilantro.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't have canned peaches, so I used two fresh peaches instead. I used 3/4 cup of maple syrup and 1/2 cup of white sugar for the peach syrup. I didn't use jam. I used half a white onion instead of green onions,and parsley instead of cilantro. Next time I'll use 1 1/2 tsp of curry because my children thought it was too spicy. Also, I'm going to throw in some raisins. If using fresh peaches, be sure to reduce heat and cook until the peaches are as soft as canned peaches, and the liquid thickens. This is a great recipe to go by if you are interested in making a peach relish!

This is a great recipe! I made it since it sounded diffrent from anything I've tasted before, and I have to say I was very suprised. Peach and curry go together suprisingly well. The only change I made was ommitting the onions and cilantro since neither seem nessesary. Other than that, this was very good and I plan on making this again next time I have company over.

Very tasty overall.  Peaches are a genius idea, although I think that the recipe could take fresh peaches if you want to knock out a little of the sweetness.  Easy to make!

So good! I substituted apricot jam since I had it on hand. Wonderful sauce and will try other ideas to add sauce to cooked egg noodles.I think maybe small pork meatballs would be good swimming in this sauce for a party idea.

Delicious! Used fresh peaches; didn't have the mustard, so I just used more honey. I oven-baked the chops and then smothered the sauce on top. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was really delicious. I added a dash of hot chili sauce to the glaze and I pan fried my chops with olive oil spray instead of the vegetable oil. I served over couscous with lots of fresh cilantro and it was divine :)

Good recipe, but definitely more sweet than curry flavour.  Nice for a change to the same old.

Very tasty!  I used a fresh peach because that's what I had. Cooked it down in a simple syrup of 1 c. oj and 2T sugar for about 20 min . Followed rest of directions as written.  I loved the flavor.

This was delicious! A big hit with everyone for sure. We grilled our chops and fixed the glaze/sauce in a saucepan on the stove - definitely double the sauce so you'll have enough to eat over rice. I chopped the peaches into chunks and added them in with the rest of the sauce ingredients after sauteing 1/4 of a yellow onion (not a fan of green onions). I will definitely make again, but try it with fresh peaches and homemade peach jam - I'm sure that will be even more amazing!

I had a ton of canned peaches that I needed to find a use for.  After seeing this recipe I knew exactly what I was making with them.  It tastes wonderful.  I did have to change a few things out of necessity.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used the kind we had at home and we are out of honey so I substituted brown sugar instead.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mix and a tbs of onion powder too.  And no cilantro since noone in this house likes it, I just garnished with another thinly slices green onion.  I will definatly make this again and soon.  Even my mother who doesn't usually like curry flavors loved this dish and wants to see it for dinner again.

We thought this recipe was really good and very different.  The peach and curry was genius. The cilantro was perfect and I'm not a big cilantro fan.  Will make this again for sure.  Thanks Krazykhat for such a good and unique flavor sensation!

My husband and I found this to be an absolutely outstanding and wonderful curry.  I did use a lot more curry than the recipe called for,  and I skipped the cilantro.

This was an awesome recipe. I did change it just a bit though to enhance the flavor a bit. I scored the pork chops and slowly fried them after braising them. I added the sauce and cooked everything together while turning constantly for 20 minutes (thick cut chops). They turned out so tender and flavorful. Will cook these over and over again. Thanks for such a wonderful addition to my cookbook!!

Really good! I goofed up and used lite peaches in juice instead of heavy syrup so the sauce was watery but the flavor was so terrific. I added a bit of Indian Five Spice also and omitted the scallions. Served with Malak Paneer and homemade Falafel. What a great dinner!

All four of my kids ate this, which is unheard of for a meat dish, and I enjoyed it too. The cooking time was much too long for my somewhat thin pork steaks and didn't allow the sauce to reduce, so I will probably just quickly brown them before adding the sauce next time.

My boyfriend and I really liked this...I initially thought the curry flavor was too strong but I added all the juice from a can of peaches plus half of the slices and some brown sugar and boiled it on the stove to thicken it up into a sauce and seasoned the prom chops with some salt and pepper and a pinch of Cajun seasoning while cooking, then poured the sauce on top. The sauce was really, really good that way. :)

Delicious! This one is a keeper! I used OJ rather than the syrup from the peaches since it is basically just HFCS. A dash of cayenne to kick up the spice. I served with basmati rice and broccoli. My husband and I both loved it

Great recipe! I'm not sure what size pork chops the recipe is referring to but mine were around 1" thick and took quite a bit longer than 8 minutes to cook. I like the idea someone else mentioned of making extra glaze -- I served this over rice and extra glaze would've been great!

My Family loved this recipe I did change it up a bit my husband does not like peaches so I used oranges instead and added more curry shake and garlic and it was awesome. Normally hubby is not for a variety of foods but this has changed his mind and told me that he would be willing to try any of my new recipes thanks for the recipe that opened up his mind and eyes to new things!!!

I had already taken out center cut loin chops for dinner before I opened my mail this morning and what a wonderful dinner we enjoyed this evening. Followed the recipe but I didn't have any peach jam. Not one ingredient overpowered the other. Just a perfect blend of amazing flavor. Will double the sauce and try it with rice next time. Just loved this one. Thank you for submitting.

This was a good recipe.  The chops need to be cooked much longer than the recipe calls for.  Next time I make it, I will make more glaze- it needs it.  Will also try with chicken instead of pork.  Great with fresh green beans and brown rice.

Great recipe and extremely quick and easy! I did add salt to the sauce as I found it needed it, as well as seasoning the chops with s&p before cooking. I used half regular dijon and half grainy dijon. I accidentally omitted the honey but found this to be sweet enough with the syrup. I also didn't use the jam as I didn't have any but think that mango chutney might be a good addition, as well. This makes a fabulous presentation on the plate and would be a nice dish for company but also an easy weeknight dinner. Thanks for posting!

This is yummy and the sauce will go great with most pork.....I used the doubled sauce with some chicken broth in my slow cooker with a pork roast that I browned first.  Also, if you are using the peach juice....you can just puree the peaches to use for the "jam".  This worked great for me then when I pulled the roast to rest, I thicken up the sauce with a quick corn starch slurry.  Everyone loved it and there was plenty of  sauce to put on the brown rice!

Love this recipe. I changed a few things; I omitted the jam; add if you want it thicker & sweeter. I also used 1 tablespoon of curry because we love the taste. Made extra sauce & goosed with Asian noodles. Garnished whole meal with chopped peaches & cilantro. It was delicious!!

Awesome!  Made this tonight for mom and grandma with the intent of using up some of the homemade peach jam I had brought.  Was a bit worried grandma wouldn't go for the curry, but she loved it.  Changes...just browned the chops, removed them, then cooked a sliced onion in the pan.  Removed the onion and added the chops back to finish cooking.  Flipped then, then added theonion back in while they cooked on the other side.  Then added in the sauce and peaches together with the green onions.  Served with steamed broccoli that was a great complement with the sauce.  Was hoping to take leftovers to my dad tomorrow, but no leftovers to take!  Not that I think they would have lasted through the night, anyway...  :)

This was absolutely delicious!  I used 3 fresh peaches instead of canned so I made a syrup of water, sugar and a little maple syrup to make up for what would have been in canned peaches - as suggested by someone else.

This recipe is definitely worth making. Make sure to use the green onion and cilantro it really adds a lot of depth. I made brown rice and fresh green beans as someone else suggested and it was a perfect combination.

I made a special trip to the store to make sure I had all the right ingredients, and I'm glad I did. This was very tasty, though next time I will probably add more curry, or maybe something else to give a little more of a kick. The mix of flavors was excellent, and definitely a good change from boring old pork chops.

Sauce was very tasty, but the pork chops themselves needed more flavor - maybe marinating them overnight in the glaze or rubbing them with a little extra curry, salt & pepper would help?

This was really good...better than I expected it to be, but was still missing something. I think a little more curry next time might do the trick. Also, I made this with waffle fries and my husband soaked his in the sauce. They were even more delicious than the chops so I will try to think of another kind of potato recipe that I can serve the sauce up with for a kickin side dish!

I would add more liquid and pineapple to this recipe, and more curry as well. The combination of flavors is great, but could use some more spicing up.

We had a bunch of peaches to get rid of so I thought instead of canned peaches I would use the real thing.  It was awesome and my husband is thrilled that it is a year around dish and not just seasonal.  For the canned juices I made a simple sugar sauce and thickened it up and added pureed peaches for the jam.  It turned out incredible.

This was pretty good, I was a bit skeptical because I'm not a big fan of peaches and I've never cooked with curry before, but I had bought some curry since my husband was on business in Japan and was introduced to a lot of curry dishes and he liked them.  So when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try.  I believe he liked it more than I did.  I will make this again.

These chops would have been even better if I haden't charred them on the grill. Nobody's fault but mine........I did add pepper to the sauce and use orange marmalade (no peach jam). Will use it again.

Excellent - I realized too late that I didn't have honey in the pantry, so I substituted with brown sugar which gave it the sweetness it needed (without it was a little to bitter tasting to me).  Served with string beans and stuffing.
