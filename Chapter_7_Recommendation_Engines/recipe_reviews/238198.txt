We really liked this recipe, but it was a little too rich for me.  I'm thinking of substituting cottage cheese for the cream cheese.  I also substitute cottage cheese with ricotta in my regular Italian lasagna with marinara and ground beef.

Only change I made was to omit the sun dried tomatoes b/c I forgot to buy them. A great recipe!

Quick and easy so I chose it for a last minute dinner for out-of-town guests along with a salad. Everyone around agreed the recipe is a "keeper" - it is wonderful!
