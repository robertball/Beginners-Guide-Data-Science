I thought this was a good concept, but I changed the recipe a bit.  I used six boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 2lbs) seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and a little salt.  I put a little bbq sauce in the bottom and then I layered the chicken.  I covered the chicken with about 28 ounces of Sweet Baby Rays bbq sacue.  After four hours on low it was done.  The chicken fell apart and the sauce was delicious!

This is really a great idea.  I read the reviews before I prepared it, noted that some said that it was dry, and decided to add some water to thin the barbacue sauce down and give the recipe less of a chance to dry out.  It turned out PERFECT.  As noted before me, the meat fell off the bone, and was not dry at all.  Nothing short of delicious.

I was skeptical... BBQ in a crock-pot?  Well, I used a combination of "Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce" and "Grant's Midnight Grill" sauces .  Took skin off and any big ol' hunks of fat.  Also stuffed inside and on top with green apples and green onions.  If possible, find a way to "raise" the chicken up from the bottom of the crockpot to get it out of the juices (bowl or bunched up foil).  So good!!  Be sure to let the bird rest after you pull it out and before cutting so it will retain its juiciness.  Yummy!!  Definately a regular!!

Very good recipe! I have made it twice so far using kraft honey barbacue sauce and chicken leg quaters. The 1st time I made it the sauce thinned out and it took away alot of flavor. So the 2nd time I made it I took the skin off the meat and it made the sauce much thicker and tasty. The meat fell off the bone and my husband loves it. I plan on making it again with boneless,skinless cuts of meat in the future.

I used chicken breasts and a whole jar of bbq sauce.  My kids loved it!  The chicken was very tender and fell off the bone.

This was really tender and fell off the bone.  The only problem is that it sits in so much grease in the crockpot.

I rate this chicken recipe with 5 stars for ease but a 1 on flavor, very bland. I have tried this recipe 3 times now each time using different brands and flavors of BBQ sauce (the latest being spicy hot), still to no avail. There just wasn't any flavor to the chicken. When I told my husband I wouldn't be trying again he said, "I am okay with that." Not the chicken recipe for us.

This recipe will not be dry if you use chicken thighs.  Breast meat will turn out dry (don't know why).  We also like to use KRAFT Honey Mustard BBQ Sauce (we use the entire bottle).  We LOVE it, and it's perfect for when I'm gone all day.

Taking the suggestion of many reviewers, I made the following changes: (a) removed the skin and excess fat from the chicken prior to cooking, (b) seasoned the meat with chicken rub, (c) stuffed the bird with a sliced apple, (d) placed aluminum foil balls in the bottom of the slow cooker, (e) poured water in the bottom (maybe 1/2 or 1 cup), and (f) used more sauce, probably about 2 1/4 cups.    After 6 hours, the meat was so tender that it fell off the bone, and serving it was very messy. Husband was silent until halfway through his second serving, at which point he declared, "This is very good!"   The leftovers will be BBQ chicken sandwiches. Mmmm.

Quick, this recipe is not.  But delicious, simple, and downright a winner in my kitchen.  I set off to work to come home to a meal without the fuss.  Goes great with potato salad or bbq beans.  Don't forget the napkins!!

For the person who said it sat in too much grease, I found from another recipe, put in three balled-up pieces of aluminum foil on the bottom and lay the chicken on it. It doesn't sit in the grease and comes out really good.

I know it sounds strange but if you use a thick bbq sauce and add some sprite or sierra mist mixed with the bbq sauce and make sure you pour it in the inside of the chicken it really tastes a lot better!  Just make sure you use crumpled foil at the bottom of the crock pot and tilt the chicken so that the open cavity is tilted upward to insure the sauce will soak from the inside out. Also if  you put the chicken breast side down they will def not come out dry ever. If you don't have 8 hours then leave on high and it will come out just as good in 4-6 hours depending on your crock pot. Trust me it is worth trying this way and if you want a sweeter taste use pineapple ring just placed over the top but be sure to drain the juice and press them between paper towels. I have 4 kids and they love it, they actually fight over the pineapple!

What perfect timing to find such a recipe! I knew I'd be working on day to complete a project and wouldn't have time to babysit a stove. My husband loves BBQ chicken. This seemed too simple, but I tried it. I used 1 cup of BBQ sauce for 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the sauce and made sure the chicken was covered by it. I didn't start until 2:30 PM so I set the crockpot on high. We ate it around 6 PM and it was perfect! Tender and moist with good flavor. My husband raved about it! He'll be home tomorrow so I told him I made the third piece of chicken for his lunch. He declared me a saint... LOL! Great addition to my rotating meal schedule. Thanks, suessinmi!

I used 8 - 4oz frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a 28oz bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Cooked on low for 6 hours and was perfect. Cooking chicken from frozen keeps it moist in my opinion. Made some minute rice which was great with the sauce poured over it. The chicken had a smokey flavor to it. Tastey easy recipe. Thanks!!

My boyfriend really liked this recipe, but I thought the flavour was so-so.  We used 3/4 of a bottle of Diana's sauce, and slow cooked for 8 hours.  I followed the advice of others and put a little bit of water and elevated the chicken using balls of aluminium foil.  I don't think the water was necessary since I think the chicken would submerged in sauce and fat anyway.  I usually don't like slow cooking meats because they usually come out really fatty and oily unless you drain it regularly.  Since I was at work, I couldn't do that.  But despite all of this, I thought it was really easy and pretty good.  I think next time I'll try a BBQ sauce with a stronger flavour.

OMG, this recipe is super easy and awesome!  The meat does literally fall off, be careful taking the whole thing out as the meat just falls off.  I take the legs off right from the pot then pick up the rest to take out. I pretty much followed it directly. 

BIG NOTE:  I took some of the other's recommendations and used Sweet Bay Rays BBQ sauce (a definite), stuffed some rough cut chunks of an onion inside the cavity (for flavor), and to keep it from sitting completely in it's juices/grease I placed 3 large carrots on the bottom & rolled up some aluminum foil into balls to fill in some of the spaces where I thought it was needed to keep it raised more because the carrots do soften over the cooking and will drop the chicken down some (thus the foil balls) to keep it raised when this happens. 

I have made this several times and it is a permanent in my recipe box.

I normally take the chicken out, pour the sauce throuh a mesh strainer & then put the sauce back in to crockpot, by then the chicken has cooled off enough so I can pull the meat off it entirely, shredding it up with my hands as I go along, and placing the meat back in the crockpot. Mix, keep on warm....and serve whenever as scoops of BBQ chicken or put on rolls for a sandwich (with slaw on top if you're from the south, LOL).

I make this often, although I only use chicken breasts.  I throw the chicken breasts in the crock pot with the BBQ sauce, and, once it is finished cooking, it shreds easily with a fork.  Also, I use honey BBQ sauce and serve over rice.  This is one of my family's favorite's-- not to mention a cheap, easy dinner!

I've made this receipe numerous times - it really is the perfect busy day meal.  To keep the bird out of the liquid that accummulates on the bottom of the slow cooker during cooking, make 3 "balls" out of tinfoil, and place them in the slow cooker first.  Then, set the bird on top of the balls (which lifts the bird off the bottom of the slow cooker).  Cover in BBQ sauce.  Cook 10 hours on low.  I use this method to cook whole birds all the time, using a variety of seasonings (not just BBQ sauce).  It's fantastic.  Plus, the bird is easy to debone and the leftover meat (which freezes well) can be used in a plethora of ways.

I used 6 chicken breasts...and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, this was very yummy to come home to after a long cold day outside! I added one and one half bottle and about 1/2 cup of water.

Just two ingredients, but wow - so delicious! To make this into a whole meal, I put chunks of potato and slices of onion underneath the chicken. I seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Then I poured the sauce over the potatoes and the chicken and added half a cup of water. I cooked on high for eight hours and everyone loved it!

I put the two large split chicken breasts in the slow cooker, covered them with the barbecue sauce and added about a cup or two of water to the bottom and let it go for 8-9 hours like directed.  When I pulled it out I picked all the skin and bones out, shredded it up with a fork and added more barbecue sauce and mixed it all up, served it with garlic toast, baked beans, and baked fries-- wonderful meal!  I wouldn't overdo it with the barbecue sauce in the cooker, it's a waste because the chicken doesn't absorb it very much of the sauce anyways so I suggest adding more after it cooks.

I love to make recipes healthy but taking off the skin on this chicken left it very dry. The second time I made it I left the skin on and it was fabulous!  Also I stuffed the chicken with chopped up apples which really added to the flavor. Mississippi brand BBQ sauce was better than the sweet and tangy. NOTE- you do not have to completely cover the chicken with sauce and water for it to cook. I used one bottle of sauce and then filled that bottle with water and poured it in.

This was just ok the first time. Too bland and the sauce became more like a broth. So the second time I injected the best part of an entire 20oz  bottle of my fav BBQ combo (Yoshida's Grourmet sauce, Chinese Chili sauce and Kraft Honey BBQ with a few additions like Jack Daniels #7 and some molassas and liquid smoke)throughout the bird especially along the major bones and through the flesh. i elevated the bird with a stainless rack (raw potatoes on the feet to keep the rack from cracking the crock when hot).Heaped with raw onions thinly sliced (they are very sweet when cooked) and 1/2 cup white wine in the bottom to start the cooking with 1 c double strengh chicken broth. I've done this with several flavors too - Italian Dressing, Greek Dressing make a great injectable marinade and cooking flavor base as a substitute for the BBQ.  A great way to cook a large bird! OR a half of a turkey breast!

Tasty & easy, but a little disappointing if made just as listed.  You *do* need to add extra water, BBQ sauce, and seasoning. Elevate the chicken, as one other person recommended.  I stuffed the cavity with onions, and added probably 2-3 cups BBQ sauce, with 2 cups water.  Also add whatever seasonings you like best on chicken.  So easy though, if you're in a hurry and have a chicken thawed. :)

I took a few hints from the other reviews with this recipe. I marinated chicken thighs overnight in minced garlic and a little bbq sauce. In the morning I added a little more bbq sauce, totaling an entire bottle! I let it cook on the slow cooker for 7 hours on low. When I got home the meat was falling off the bone!!! It was the most moist chicken we've had in awhile!! It was fantastic! Thanks for the great, easy recipe!!!

Super, easy, delicous, meal. I used 1/2 of a 28oz bottle of Kraft Honey Barbeque Sauce and equaled the same amount of water to rinse out the bottle and remaining sauce. This I added to the slow cooker due to previous comments about  dryness and I also peeled back the skin to expose the meat.  I had a super huge whole chicken weighing 6.6 lbs which almost did not fit in the slow cooker.  Chicken fell off the bone and was super moist and delicous. Served with bisquits to sop up the yummy juices.

We really enjoyd this. I followed the other reviews and balled up foil and placed the chicken on top of it. We used an entire bottle of honey BBQ sauce (store brand) and drenched the inside and out of the chicken.

Those reviewers who said this was dry must have done something wrong. It was moist and tasty. Obviously easy. I removed most of the skin and chunks of fat. Next time I might also pierce the chicken before applying the bbq sauce so the flavor gets inside. But it was great as it is.

I wouldn't classify this as a recipe, rather a recommendation for preparation. Either way, it worked wonderfully. I don't normally put chicken in the crockpot, but decided to try this. I added a little water to the bottom of the slow cooker, and my chicken was falling off the bone in 7 hours, was juicy and delicious. I did add extra barbecue sauce near the end. Family loved it. Thank you!

Tip:don't use frozen or partially frozen chicken, dark meat is a must for a moist chicken in the end and cook 8 hours max. I use a 1970's Crock pot slow cooker. Remove the fat/skin if you don't want fat floating on the top. I made this a few times before it turned out really good. I love to use Sweet Baby Rays spicy BBQ sauce.

Loved this recipe, loved it even more after reading the reviews.  Took the suggestion of layering onions, bbq sauce(Baby Rays)and boneless chicken breasts.  After finishing three layers in my big crock, I added a can of chicken broth to keep chicken from getting dry. Also added some Johnny's salt and garlic chips.  Family loved it, including the liquid, constantly dipping their rolls into it. Thank you for this quick and easy recipe.

This was pretty good, but I will definately use boneless skinless chicken next time.  The flavor was great, but you had to dig through a big pot of skin and bones and sauce to find the meat.

This was easy to prepare and the meat tender and juicy but didn't taste good at all.  The sauce was watery and had very little flavour.  Maybe it was the kind of BBQ sauce.  I used Kraft regular BBQ sauce.

This chicken is amazing!!  The meat is juicy and falls off the bone.  I can't believe how easy this is and how good it tastes.  If you don't have time to make dinner, just throw chicken and barbecue sauce in the crock pot and go to work.  When you come home, VIOLA Dinner!

Sorry, but this just wasn't very good- it came out very dry- I assume the timing is too long with that, but it definitely needs something else to flavor.- maybe onions, seasonings.

This was my first slow cooker Recipe.  I found it very easy!  The comments are accurate when saying you need more BBq sauce. I used between  2 & 2 1/2 cups total & it worked out well for us. I also added savory.  You do need to make sure the chicken is fully thawed, as it increases the water level in the cooker and those pieces that fall in it will lose some of the flavour. I added 1 cup of water to the cooker.  The meat is very tender, as it falls off the bone with just the touch of a fork.  What's left in the slow cooker once you remove the chicken is great for gravy!!  Enjoy!  I know we did!

Haven't made this recipe, yet, but I will soon.I rated it on how I think it will be. Hint: to raise meats from the bottom, crumble sheets of aluminum foil and layer in the bottom of the cooker. For light or thin meats, you can use regular foil. For heavier and thicker pieces of meat (such as a whole chicken) use heavy duty foil. It takes practice to know how much foil to use and how thick the layer should be for each type of meat. Hope this helps.

Like some of the others here, I used adjusted this recipe just a bit. I put about 1/2 inch of barbeque sauce on the bottom, 1/2 cup of chopped up fresh pineapple, three large boneless/skinless breasts and about 1/2 cup of pineapple on top. I then covered the entire thing with barbeque sauce. I cooked on low for 5 hours. It was superb! The breasts just about fell apart as I removed them. I served with the pineapple chunks and sovered slightly with the sauce. Sweet and tangy with every bite!

We just got a crock pot as a wedding gift and what with my super long commute every day, I was thrilled to find such an easy crock pot recipe! However, I will NOT use a whole chicken next time and WILL use boneless, skinless chicken breats. I won't even go into what I thought it looked like when I took off the lid. However, it was quite tasty and I will do this again, just not with a whole chicken!!!

I'm going to try this one again, but the bunched up foil is not a good idea. The acids in the sauce will break down the aluminum, which is not good. If you're going to take the skin and fat chunks off, there is no need to raise the chicken. It just dries out.

This recipe was so quick and easy and the chicken was SOOOOO moist and fell off the bone.  I put in 2 leg quarters along with some of my family's secret recipe bbq sauce, a few dashes of garlic powder and some brown sugar and let it cook on high for 4 hours.  About halfway through I added a couple of pieces of cut up beef smoked sausage.  I've just found one of my Superbowl recipes.  I might even try it with wings!  YUM!

I am making this recipe for the 5th time!  It is awesomely easy and if one chooses the barbecue sauce carefully, really good!  Because the sauce is the only thing being added, it has to be of good quality, so take the time and money to get a good one!  My family loves this dish; every last piece of chicken gets eaten!

5 stars for the original recipe, and a negative 5 stars for the commenter who said they cooked 6 chicken breasts on low heat for 4 hours and the chicken fell apart. I have used my slow cooker for countless recipes at the allotted low heat or high heat settings, and my food has always come out the way the recipe intended. I just attempted, at this commenter's suggestion, to cook the 6 pieces on low heat for 4 hours...just checked my chicken, and the insides are all raw. If you hope to have any sort of success with this dish cooking it for 4 hours, you must use the high heat setting, not the low.

This is so awesome, here's what I did that differs from the original: 

I started preparing around noon, and I had a cut up whole chicken, close to four pours but not quite. I did put it on low at first, and then to high. I believe the crock pot you use dictations, in part, when your chicken is done by an hour or so. I also used ketchup in an attempt to kind of sweeten up my BBQ sauce a bit, and depending on the brand-this may or may not lend itself to thickening up the sauce. You could go a lot of ways with this I think, pairing fruit with the sauce and chicken, such as pineapple or even canned apple pie filling. Which, I didn't do due to the fact that my boyfriend doesn't like that much meddling with his chicken/meats in general. Overall, easy recipe and good too. Not spectacular, but I don't think it's at the fault of the recipe itself. You have to put your own spin on it to really liven it up

Love this recipe, will definitely do it again!  I did it with a whole, skinless chicken and put some water in the bottom of the pot, then added the chicken and poured the BBQ sauce on top.  It set in the pot for 8 hours, but when I went to pull it out it was so tender that it completely fell apart!  I would recommend doing this with boneless chicken!  Regardless, it was still a huge hit in our house!

This was so simple it is hard not to like. Although it seems like every time I make chicken in the crockpot it comes out kind of mealy no matter what the recipe. Must just be the result of slow cooker chicken.

I made this for my husband and kids.  They all thought it was great!  My husband liked that it was barbeque without being overly barbeque.  I did add some garlic and pepper and a little water.

Absolutely wonderful! Because I work over an hour and a half away from home, it's always difficult to make chicken during the week, as it takes so much time in the oven. But with this...I get to give my family a delicious chicken dinner whenever I want. I've tried so many different kinds of BBQ sauce, and each one has been a hit. Thank you so much for this!!!

can't get any easier than this!  I used boneless skinless breast and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  Tangy and tender.  Definitely going to make it again!  Even my daughter who claims to not like BBQ loved it.

Easy! I used leg quarters and added some seasonings and used extra bbq sauce. But this recipe is perfect for when you don't have time to mess around with cooking or you are just feeling lazy like I was.

Sooooo yummy! After 8 hours of cooking on low, the chicken fell right off the bones and was so tender and succulent. It really was so fast and easy to put on and forget about, except for when I'd get a whiff of that delicious aroma wafting through the house, of course.

This is one SUPER easy, super yummy recipe!!  I added potatoes and carrots, and it was gone in no time!  I did however have a hard time getting the chicken out of the crock, because it fell off the bones.  Yum!!

This was the easiest chicken I have ever made! I put a 4 1/2 lb whole chicken in the crockpot for 1 1/2 hours on high then changed it to low for 5 hours. The chicken fell of the bones and was great!!! I will be making this at least twice a month!

This was the first time I have ever made a whole roasting chicken - I brined it the night before and then an added 1.5-2 cups Sweet Baby Ray's and about 1/2 cup of water to the pot. It cooked for 8.5 hours and came out PERFECT. Serve with some extra BBQ sauce on the side. It pairs up nicely with cornbread and baked beans!

This was a great recipe.  I too used 6 boneless chicken breasts instead of bone-in chicken.  I put it in the crockpot on my lunch break.  I poured in 1/4 of the bbq sauce, added the chicken, sprinkled some salt, pepper, and garlice powder, and then poured the rest of the bottle in.  I added about a cup or so of waterand left it on low for 4 hours. After 4 hours I took it out and the chicken was perfectly cooked, but I decided to chop it out so it would resemble bbq and so it would soak up more of the sauce.  I added some more water because it was a little bit on the dry side.  I left it on warm until everyone was home for dinner.  It was great!!  The chicken was very flavorful and moist and had a great texture.  It was also so easy! I definitely recommend this.

I also changed this recipe up a bit and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts with the Sweet Baby Rays honey BBQ sauce. I added a little water and it came out tender and really good!! With potato salad and baked beans with ground meat and bbq sauce mixed in, it was great!

I had skinless chicken thigh fillets on hand so used those in place of a whole chicken.  Cooked for 6.5 hours before turning off cooker. Really haven't ever had an easier delicious dinner.  Going into the family favourite file. Thank you for sharing. Carol.

My mom used to make this for us when we were little. The only difference is she used the whole cut up chicken so she didn't have to pull it apart.  Very messy, but very good.

I left this for about an hour longer than was indicated so it just fell apart it was done so perfect. I also used about twice as much sauce as the recipe called for, so that I would have some sauce left in the slow cooker. It was a touch bland, but that may have been the sauce I was using, so I just poured some of the leftover sauce on top, and added a little hot sauce, served it over toasted bread with some fries, fantastic!

Can't get any easier than this.  I now do this with pork tenderloin too.  I add an onion and occassionally a green pepper.  Shred up the chicken and use it on sandwiches.

This recipe was easy and came out pretty tasty. I seasoned the chicken (adobo & pepper) and set in on top of two balls of alum. foil, then poured the BBQ sauce. It came out flavorful and tender while the fat dripped away.

The chicken breast was a little dry, even though it had been cooked breast-down in the bbq sauce.  I removed the skin and a lot of fat before cooking to reduce the greasy-ness of the dish.  The meat just fell off the bone which is perfect for my 15 month old.  The cheapest bbq sauce is not for this recipe.  It takes the flavor of it and amplifies it so make sure you've got a flavor you really like!  The smallest chicken I found was a little above 5 lbs and the cooking time worked perfectly.  When using this recipe you might be better off with a larger bird or less cooking time.  I will be making this again.

Used three rolled up foil balls under chicken to keep it from swimming in the fat juices.  I did use a whole chicken with skin on and it was so tender.  I used the BBQ sauce and 1/4 cup water.  Didn't think the BBQ sauce added anything, but it was tender and juicy.  I cooked it 4 hours on high and made a foil tent for the chicken to cool under after I removed it from the crock pot.

I loved this recipe.  I was at the lake without an oven, in charge of making BBQ Chicken for sandwiches for the football game, and would never had been able to make the chicken had it not been for this recipe.  I did read many of the reviews, learning from others trials and errors.  I did stuff my chicken with onion and garlic, and placed it on balls of foil.  I did spice up my BBQ sauce by adding chilli sauce and I did use a BBQ Chicken rub on it as well as adding a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to just rub, stuff and let it cook. It was even great to strain the sauce, remove the grease, and place the falling apart chicken back into it, less the bones and skin.  Heating it up again for 30 minutes before game time allowed us to have perfect BBQ Chicken sandwiches.  I even had coleslaw to top the sandwiches off, which was a great hint from one of the reviewers.  Highly recommend this easy easy meal.

Personally, I enjoyed it, but the other three in my family just considered it 'meh'.  They were turned off by the dark color of the chicken breast and all of the chicken 'turned down', which was odd, because when I normally do chicken in the crockpot they are all over it.  Thank you from me....because that means more leftovers for me!

Very easy recipe. Rather than read the reviews, I followed the recipe. My slow cooker, even on very low (I have 2 low settings) cooks hot.I checked it after 7 hours and knew immediately it was overcooked. I probably should have checked it after 4.5 to 5 hours. Anyway, even overcooked, my girls liked it. Two things for the next time I cook it: 1) shorter cooking time! 2) replace half cup of BBQ sauce for one bottle of chili sauce to give it a zing.

Use boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Tastes fantastic, and it doesn't get any easier!

So very easy and versatile.  This gives you an entire chicken to reinvent multiple ways throughout the week with very little effort involved.  I do recommend sticking to the recommended cooking times.  Mine did get a little dry, but it was my fault for cooking it too long.  I used Stubbs Original BBQ sauce.  I served it the first night with mashed potatoes and corn.  Still had enough leftovers to reinvent it into chicken enchiladas one night and chicken tortilla soup another night.  I used the “Chicken Tortilla Soup I” recipe by Star Pooley found on this site.  Highly recommend it if you have leftover chicken, especially with the sweet and spicy tang of this chicken cooked in Stubbs sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, using our favorite BBQ sauce and cooking for 9 hrs on low. The chicken did fall off the bone, but was dry and did not taste very good ( it was bland ). I will not make this again.

I made these last week for my family and it was a hit. I used boneless/skinless chicken and cooked it for about 4 hours. I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy and Easy!!  I was looking for something to put together fast and to use up boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I accidentally opened a bag of tenders instead, but they worked great! I put a little BBQ sauce on the bottom of the crockpot, then layers the tenders and more BBQ sauce.  I used a 2.5 pound bag of chicken and 1.5 (18 oz) bottles of BBQ sauce.  Then cooked it on low for 4 hours.  It was a little overdone (esp. at the bottom), so I think next time I'll try only cooking it for 3 hours. Couldn't be easier and the kids loved it!

this worked very well.  I made by own barbeque sauce instead of using a store bought one.  However, I also stuffed two cored and sliced gala apples inside and cut up two more and added to the crock pot.  Added a wonderful flavor to the barbeque taste.  I know it was good as my 31 year old son and his 6 year old daughter each had second helpings.

Who would have thought bbq chicken in a slow cooker? Had to cut the chicken into quarters to fit in my slow cooker. Also adjusted the seasoning to suit my taste ----added a few generous splashes of Crystal hot sauce, a few shakes of garlic powder,onion powder and liquid smoke. Thanks for the great idea.

so simple but so very good.  I used 6 chicken legs and found that two different types of BBQ sauce mixed in together gave me the flavor i was wanting.  About one hour before done, I added 1/2 chopped red onion.  Fabulous!

This is SO easy and SO delicious... BUT the key is picking out QUALITY BBQ SAUCE!  It makes or breaks the recipe.  We always use Famous Dave's... make sure you don't just pick a cheap-o brand... stick with quality BBQ you like and this will be one of your family's favorites!

Wow, what a wonderful easy recipe.  It was easy to make and was a hit.  Although I did use the others advice.  I put a bed of onions on the bottom and used chicken breast.  I also used more BBQ.  I season my chicken breast and added another layer of seasoning 30mins before I turned off the crock pot.  My picky 6 yr old son, who only gives "thumbs to the side or thumbs down", gave it a "thumbs up".  100% I'll make this again.  Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe.

I used skinless bone-in thighs and rubbed them with Morans Seasoned Grilling Salt(I love this seasoning, I use it on just about everything).  I read some of the other reviews and cut up onions to go on the bottom of the slow cooker then placed the thighs ontop and poured B-B-Q sauce on.  The chicken was done after 6 hours set on low.  Very tasty and easy.  My husband and boys loved it, will make it again.

I used chicken breast and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder. I also added minced garlic. I liked how easy it was to prepare, but the chicken was extremely dry. I will try this again - maybe with beef instead. My boyfriend did not care for this. I'd have to agree, just because it was so dry. The sauce I used was great though...

QUICK PREP & EASY! I broke my ankle & need quick'n'easy recipes that keep me off my feet. This one is a keeper! I put a layer of sliced onions at the bottom of my slow cooker. I cleaned, dried, and seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper, and a little olive oil. Then I stuffed it with onions & 1 whole head of garlic. Placed the chicken on top of the onions, and covered every square inch of chicken with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. 6 hrs on low setting. Let chicken rest before carving. I placed the cut up chicken back into the cooker & set it on warm for about 2 hrs. Served with baked potato & fresh zucchini. YUM!

This gets a 5 for ease of use. I am definitely going to use this recipe again when the cold weather hits. I had used a whole chicken, but we aren't big fans of the dark meat so I am going to try just the chicken breasts next time as other users have tried. It does smell good and is so quick to get started in the morning. That's the best part!

This was ok. I added some apple juice to the bottom of the pot in the hopes that it would stay moist because I thought I was going to cook it longer than it said. The problem with putting a whole chicken in a slowcooker is that all the bones just sort of intermingle with the food. I didn't think I would but now I agree def. easier with chicken breasts. I don't think the chicken took on much of the taste of anything I added to the pot (I also put 1/2 a chopped onion). rather bland I suppose. I used the chicken as the base for my BBQ chicken calzones and so for that purpose it was great. I alos highly recommend removing the skin and excess fat no matter what. I can't imagine what a huge mess it would have been if I had left it on hte whole thing. As it was I left it on the wings and a small portion of the leg. YUCK...

This ended up being so tender.  Yes the skin wasn't crisp, didn't expect it to be in the slow cooker with the steam.  But I've made other whole chickens in the slow cooker and if I want to crisp up the skin, I just put it under the broiler for 10 min.  But this was so easy and yummy!!!

Chicken turned out very moist and flavorful.  I used about 7 chicken breast halfs and 1 bottle of barbecue sauce.  It didnt look like enough but it made plenty as it cooked.  Super easy and tastes great.

This is a great recipe. We often use hoogie bread and put the chicken shredded inside, and serve w/ cabbage slaw. Yummy!

so easy! I'm all about low effort and it doesn't get less complex than this!  It was great and the whole family loved it.  I think I might try it with some other sauces and dressings in the future (salad dressings,pasta sauces.. you name it!)

Although, the meat does fall off the bone, I wouldn't say it was moist.  It was actually kind of dry.  But, you get that cooking chicken in a slow cooker.  When you cook chicken in a slow cooker, it melts in your mouth.  I like it, a lot like that.  I liked the BBQ idea but I found the BBQ sauce, after cooking all day, had a burnt flavor to it.  I would suggest having some non-cooked BBQ sauce set aside (I use Sweet Baby Ray's) for after the meat is done cooking.  Otherwise you'll be useing watery, fatty, burnt tasting sauce.  My boyfriend loved this, he was "mmmm-ing" the whole time eating it.  He said it was dry too, but the BBQ sauce fixed that.  I gave this 5 stars because it is very good and I will be making this often.  Maybe next time I will put bacon (& the BBQ sauce) on the top as it cooks.

Great, easy way to cook a whole chicken which is so cheap where I live. I used a top quality barbeque sauce, punctured the thickest parts with a fork and reduced the cooking time substantially for my smaller, oval shaped cooker. I also cooked the chicken breast side down for about half the cooking time and the breast meat came out moist and tender. Super!

This was so easy!  I used boneless, skinless, added some water to cover & pierced the chicken.  Once it was done I shredded it & had a spicy bbq chicken sandwich for lunch.  Yum!  It was dry so I might add more water next time; we'll see if that helps anything.

Easy recipe! I like that part! But the chicken didn't have much flavor like I thought it would! My husband ended up dipping his chicken into more BBQ sauce out of the bottle since the stuff in the crockpot was too watery.

I would make again. Easy and cheap.I used bone in chicken thighs and drumsticks. Took off all the skin and excess fat. Put garlic powder, salt and pepper on chicken. Threw it in the crockpot with 1/4c chicken broth and bottle of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. Put it on high for five hours. It was very moist and fell off the bone! Chicken was delicious dipped in the sauce with every bite.

This is a great recipe!  I modified it based on previous reviews. I added carrots, pineapple (reserve 1/2 cup pineapple juice), and sweet onions to the bottom of the crock pot and inside the chicken.   I used 1 1/2 cups of  Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and mixed in the 1/2 cup of reserved pineapple juice.  Poured 1/2 sauce over carrots, pineapple , and onions.  Season chicken with seasoning salt and pour remaining barbecue sauce blend over top of chicken.  Top with pineapple rings and cook on low for 8 hours.   YUM!

My 6-qt. cooked this chicken to mush in 8 hours. The bones can deteriorate, splinter and become dangerous for young children to deal with. I will have to play with timing on this recipe and will use some boneless skinless thighs and breasts combined in the future.

I have made this several times and it is very good and super easy. As mentioned in another slow cooker chicken recipe, I make little balls of foil and put the chicken on that so that it is separate from all the fat that will seep down during cooking. Place it in so the dark meat is on top so that the white meat stays moist. The BBQ flavor will get a little muted, so be prepared to serve extra BBQ sauce on the side.

Skinned the chicken and then placed it on top of a chopped onion in my crockpot. One hour on high, four hours on low. It was absolutely delicious.

Very simple. I did exactly as recipe stated and it is falling off the bone. Flavor could be a little better. I will try cooking without skin next time like some reviews mentioned. I used Bullseye BBQ Kansas City style. I liked the flavor and it is the only BBQ I've found without high fructose corn syrup which is a plus for me.

this was very easy and tasted good. i used a whole chicken, cut up already. i left the skin on half and took the skin off of the other half. i added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder before covering with bbq sauce (i used about half a bottle because that's all i had - i also rinsed the bottle with a little water to get the rest out). the chicken was a bit dry so next time i will cook it for a little less time. it also needed a lot more salt. i served it over white rice. thanks for sharing!

This was mediocre at best. To be fair, I did change things a bit. I am awarding 3 *'s due to my 1 major change (but honestly, this is only deserving of 2). Drumsticks were on sale, so I used those instead of a whole bird. In retrospect, I really wish I would have tried suessinimi's recipe as is, but for fear of my chicken drying out, I didn't (a good dose of common sense & others warnings about meat drying out as it cooked all day scared me off). I think the BBQ sauce slathered in the chicken's cavity would have made for some AWESOME tasting meat (assuming it remained moist). My chicken, although not dry, was totally unappealing. If it weren't for me & my hubby being HUNGRY, we'd probably not have even eaten what was in the crockpot. My biggest gripe? Although I used an entire (regular sized) bottle of BBQ sauce (K.C. Masterpiece hickory), my chicken wasn't saucy at all! It's as if the sauce evaporated & left a burnt smelling crust behind. I guess removing the skin from my chicken wasn't such a good idea after all.... My advice? Add H2O w/ your BBQ sauce (and lots of it, especially if you're going to leave this to cook all day) & DON'T remove the skin from your bird! Served w/ all the BBQ fixins, this was an "OK" meal. I certainly wouldn't make this again unless "as directed" & I were home all day to monitor the sc (which kinda defeats the purpose of using one to begin with, IMHO) so I probably won't be attempting this again for that very reason. Thanks for sharing tho! :-)

Got a little dry, but I thought it was still very barbecue-esque.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added some minced garlic and salt and pepper.  Used Jack Daniels' BBQ and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauces.

This was the EASIEST and BEST chicken I've ever made.  I couldn't stop eating it even though I was full.  I used a slightly sweeter BBQ mixed with a spicy bbq sauce and it turned out perfect.  YUM.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe regularly. I use chicken quarters or whatever is on sale, legs, thighs a combo. I also add a full bottle of bbq sauce and a can of COKE... yes that makes it sweet and not dry at all. Try it, I'm not kidding it's totally worth it. Also I sometimes add some garlic and season salt depending on what type of bbq sauce I"m using. Very easy and yummy.

This is such an easy recipe!  We used the chicken on corn tortillas for "chicken brisket" tacos and then used it for sandwiches.  AWESOME!

One of my easy things is cooking a whole chicken in the crock pot. My husband loved this one. I set it on some tin foil balls.

I made this yesterday for the first time.  Raised the chicken up with a bag of frozen chopped onions, and a bunch of kumquats.  :)  I have read other reviewers say they used oranges  or lemons, I had a bunch of kumquats, so that's what I used.  It worked well!  I added just enough chicken broth so as not to drown the kumquats, but wanted to make sure the chicken didn't dry out.  It was very moist and tender, it was almost a little bland, but I poured some of the juices from the crock pot over it and added a touch of salt and it was delicious.  The leftover meat will be excellent added to some other recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I rubbed the chicken down with a mixture of garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper, and rosemary.  Then proceeded with recipe.  Fair to midland results.  It was as easy as it gets to cook though.  Dump everything in the pot and fagetaboutit!!!

I used chicken breasts, 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce, and some water.  It came out really dry, more like a chicken jerky (if there's such a thing)!  Flavor was alright, just the dryness and texture wasn't.  Will use the chicken for sandwich and hope it goes better that way.

I thinned the BBQ sauce with a little chicken broth.  Also used boneless skinless breasts.  Dinner was unexpectedly delayed and they ended up cooking for about 6 hours which was too long.  4-5 hours would've been perfect!

First time I  tried this, but used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, it was awesome, I  served it with potato salad &  baked beans, my  husband loved it. I  did as one review stated and added a small amount of water, it was just right &  so  tender, I could have shredded it, it would have been great as Chicken sandwiches too.. I will be making this one again, sooooo easy!!

Very easy and very good.  I used a good 3 lbs. of chicken thighs versus the whole chicken.  After reading a lot of posts I thought I should add about 1 cup of chicken broth. I'm not quite sure it was needed, though. Chicken was flavorful and very tender, moist, fall off the bone. Can't wait for a chicken sandwich! Thanks for the post!

The kids liked it. Like other reviewers I thought it was pretty flavorless. I wanted the "juice" from the crockpot for my mashed potatoes but that was just chicken fat with bbq sauce.

This is a good recipe, you just need to be very careful on the amount of sodium. Make sure you check the label before adding in. I browned chicken breasts and onions before starting the crockpot, then I added 1/2 cup + a couple of Tbsp of barbucue sauce (can't remember the brand), and some chicken broth. It cooked for about 4 or 5 hours. When ready I cut into small pieces. I served with home-made potato salad and steemed veggies. It was really good even the next day for a sandwich.

This recipe is great!!! I hesitated when I read the reviews saying that there wasn't a lot of flavor- but I did it anyway. I reccomend Bull's Eye BBQ sauce-My bro has trouble w/ corn syrup and Bulls Eye doesn't have any. Super easy.

This recipe  is very easy to follow, and the chicken does fall right off of the bone, but it lacks flavor in a big way. I even added some all purpose seasoning, seasoned salt and a little garlic to punch it up, but the flavor is flat. We won't have this one again.

Great, easy recipe.  I actually used boneless breasts (about 2 lbs & I cut them into strips) and smothered with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Kept on high for about 4 hours and it was a hit!  Couldn't have been any easier!

This couldn't have been easier and the outcome was wonderful.  My kids are off of school for the holidays so I am trying to keep some interesting things on hand for them to eat.  I had a whole chicken, which I've never cooked one before, and was looking for something super easy that they would like.  Totally scored with this one.  I used a K.C. Masterpiece's brown sugar BBQ sauce.  I didn't even measure it, I totally eyeballed it and viola, it turned out amazing.  I think it took about 1 minute total to prepare including rinsing chiken.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was several firsts for me, first time using my new crock pot, first time cooking a slow cooker meal, first time cooking a whole chicken!  It worked, the night before i cut off some of the extra skin and fat, not all of it just the big yucky chunks!  My husband and kids ate it right up! Next time i will use honey BBQ sauce!  Thanks!

Simple and easy for those busy days.  I also add a little honey and either soy or teiyaki sauce - whatever i have on hand.  Serve it with brown rice - and a green vegetable. My family really loves this.

This was o.k. On the good side, the chicken was incredibly tender. On the bad side, the BBQ sauce had a slight burnt flavor to it. Probably won't make this one again.

This was pretty good.  I used quartered chicken cause that's what I had on hand. I was alittle worried about how the skin would turn out.  I took my skin off before eating it, but my roommate said it was mushy but tasted good.   And I seasoned it with garlic, onion and Lawerys.  The meat was juicy and tender.  I also used a crockpot line so you wouldn't get the burnt taste.  I will probably make this again

This was fine, but not nearly as good as I thought it would be from the reviews.  The chicken did 'fall off the bone', but althought it was tender I found it to be dry.  My husband thought the same thing.  I don't know how I could have messed it up, it's two steps, but somehow this was sub-par.  I won't make it again

This came out very good, this is what I did: I only had two people to cook for so I used 3 bone-in chicken breasts with ribs. I removed most of the skin, seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper, and balled up some foil in the bottom of the crock pot and put the meat in the pot. I covered it all with the bbq sauce I had on hand, 1 bottle Bullseye Sweet Hickory and 1/2 bottle Bullseye Sweet Homestyle. I set it on low for 5 hours and about halfway into it, I poked the meat with a fork, re-arranged the pieces (my pot is small) and added more sauce. When it was done I let it sit, then shredded the meat a little and added a little bit more sauce. Needless to say, my bbq sauce supply was almost gone after this but it is a great and easy way to make really tasty bbq chicken meat for sandwiches. Ps: It also helps if you happened to have found bbq sauce on sale for "2 for 1" ;) I'm sure I'll be making this again, thank you!

The recipe cooking time is way over what it should be.  I cooked it for only 7.5 and my chicken was fried.  The barbeque sauce was like tar. However, I do believe that every slowcooker is a bit different. I do want to try this recipe again, simply because of it's convenience factor.  I think I would do 5.5 hours on low.

Should have taken the advice of others.  This was bland and tastless.  I seasoned with seasoning salt before pouring on the bbq sauce and it still needed more salt.  The gravy(?) was really watery. Yuck.  If I were to ever attempt this again I would crush a couple of cloves of garlic into it and some brown sugar and some Frank's hot sauce - but then it wouldn't be this recipe - would it?

This was amazingly simple, tender and so tasty! The only addition I made was to sprinkle hot sauce over chicken before covering with the barbecue sauce, just because I like the taste and slight snap that hot sauce adds.  This will be a frequent addition to my meal planning!  Thanks for sharing! aprilskye21

I will definitely make this again. I did things a little different. I covered the chicken with JACK DANIEL'S HICKORY BROWN SUGAR BBq sauce. It is very thick and stays where you want it. Also, I turned the chicken over so the breast was on the bottom, where all the drippings are so it stays very moist. this is quick and easy and is so yummy.

Interestingly enough, my kids loved it, but I thought it was a little bland.  However, it was great as far as it being easy to make.  Perhaps adding some poultry seasonnin the night before might help with the flavor.

This was sooo easy and good, I did use foil balls under the chicken to keep it out of the grease. The chicken falls off the bone as stated so take care when removing it from the pot.

Rather than add water as some people suggested, I added chicken broth. I filled the crock-pot about an inch or two high with it and then added a few shakes of cayenne pepper. I rubbed a spicy barbecue rub by Rudy's all over the chicken. After that I smeared barbecue sauce all over the chicken. It was delicious.

So yummy. I cooked it last night. I keep sneaking some. I did change things. I added half a bottle honey mustered and the BBQ and added water and put salt and pepper and garlic to it. This recipe was easy and gave me some ideals. I will cook again. If I have some left I will put on a sandwich.

Ours came out kind of dry after 10 hrs of slow cooking. Definitely fell off the bone/shredded easily, but would be better in enchiladas or mixed with more BBQ sauce and put on a bun than just eating as is. It had good flavour.

I tried this exactly as wrote, I believe.  First off, based on my experience, use the smallest crockpot your chicken will fit in.  I used a 5 quart and wish I'd used the 3 quart.  May have had more BBQ taste.  We kept the skin on but then removed it to before eating and couldn't taste any BBQ.  I will try this again but will use just breast and the smaller crockpot.

It's fine for ease but if you have more time after it has cooked all day you can pull it off the bone and serve as a pulled chicken sandwich in the sauce. That is what we did.

I used 6 partially frozen, bone-in chicken breasts (skin removed), seasoned with garlic salt and smothered with BBQ sauce.  Cooked on high for 2 hours and on low for another 4 hours.  My chicken was fairly dry after cooking, but nothing a little extra sauce couldn't cure.  Next time I'll use dark meat.

Chicken really does just fall off of the bone.  i removed the skin from 1/2 of the chicken so there wouldn't be too much grease in the pot.  i used an entire bottle of bbq sauce.  i did, as some others suggested, prop chicken up on some balled up aluminum foil.  i also put 1 sliced apple inside.

Super easy and very good.  I added 3/4 can of Coke and a large white onion (roughly chopped) to give it some more flavor. I cooked it for 8 hours on low and the chicken was sooooo tender it literally fell off the bone. My one suggestion would be to have another jar of barbecue sauce on hand to add to the chicken if you really want it to  have a  barbecue flavor.

I also added some additional ingredients as mentioned by previous reviewers. The flavor was good however the chicken came out chewy and almost dry.

Super easy way to make a whole chicken. Meat absoutely fell off the bone. There wasn't as much flavor to the meat as I expected but I would try it again this way. Its great to have a meal ready to go at dinner time!

Didn't want to give a bad rating just because of how mine came out. But I am thinking it was from the sauce I used? I had chicken marinated in Kraft Honey Mustard BBQ, didn't feel like grilling it, so i threw it in the crock pot and added some onion and apple slices.

I cooked my chicken for 8 hours on low, but it turned out really dry, especially the white meat. I was surprised beacause it was very tender and looked like it would be juicy.

REALLY yummy chicken!  I had my doubts, but it turned out excellent!  I added about a cup to a cup and a half of chicken broth and put some onion and garlic inside the chicken cavity.  SO good!

This was pretty good... simple and easy.  I haven't been having much luck with my slow cooker and chicken lately, so I used breasts and cooked them in the oven at 350 for an hour.  Will probably cut the time down to 45 min. next time as the chicken was just a tad over-cooked, but other than that, it went over well with my family.

Easiest chicken I've ever fixed!! The meat was really juicy and tender and it was falling off the bones. But the BBQ sauce got all thin and watery and didn't really "stick" to the chicken, so it really lacked BBQ flavor. I think this would have been better with the chicken cut up. Will make again with boneless breasts.

This recipe was great!  I ended up using 1 1/2 bottles of Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce instead of the suggested amount.  The chicken fell off the bone.  It was moist and delicious!  I will be making this one again.

I read the notes below. I used leg quarters. I put 1 sliced onion on the bottom before putting the chicken in the crock pot. I used 1/2 cup chicken broth & 1 wholt bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. I cooked it for 7 hours on low. The meat was falling off the bone, that I could not take it out of the pot whole. It was good, but next time I will try it with the bone-in breasts, to see if it hold better.

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was the addition of onions in the bottom.  Other then that, I followed it to a "T".  The chicken was extremely over cooked to the point of being mushy.  Maybe if I shortened the cooking time it would've been better.  I guess it just wasn't the flavor or texture I was looking for.

I fixed this yesterday and listened to other reviewers advice and added some chicken broth because I was afraid the barbeque sauce would stick after cooking six or seven hours. I added a cup and half which I thought proved to be too much.  I also took others advice about seasoning the chicken with one of those chicken rubs which also proved to be too much.  Next time I'll probably add about a 1/3 cup broth and follow the directions as written.  The chicken was moist and tender but hubby thought the flavor was too much and he didn't like the skin on.  I will also probably try chicken breast alone next time or I will take the skin off all drumsticks except maybe two next time.  But the idea was great and super easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

I read through each review before I made this, and followed up with people's suggestions with my own twist.  I used a layer of onions and a cut up Thai pepper for a bed.  My marinade was a honey mustard and sweet chili sauce mix (I borrowed it from another recipe that I found on here...Thai Fried Chicken...so great!).  I also used chicken breasts, which turned out really well, but I think next time I'll use chicken thighs.  A great meal that will definitely be made again!

I printed out this recipe, and some of the reviews, and gave it to my Daughtor so she would be able to fix her BF, on her day off from work. She chose to use chicken brest, because a whole chicken was just to much for them. BF was impressed and wanted seconds so it had to be good. The only problem I have with the recipe is, I loaned her my crock pot, and now I can kiss that puppy good by.:(
Thank you for sharing recipe and for everyones reviews. They sure do help:)

This turned out ok, though not as good as I had hoped. I added a can of chicken broth so it wouldnt get dry. The BBQ sauce didnt give it as much flavor as I would have liked, next time I'll try a different kind.

i cooked this in the crock pot, on low, for about 8.5 hrs. and it was unbelievably dry. it was so disappointing. i'm not sure what went wrong - i used the same, if not more, bbq sauce and threw in some onions. i may try it again to see if the first go round was a fluke.

This was a really simple recipe and it's nice that you can experiment with different BBQ sauces (I also added a bit of chicken broth to keep things moist.) I cooked a whole chicken the first time and eventhough it was delicious, I didn't much enjoy having to take the meat off the bone, soo-o-o I think next time I'll do as many others suggested and cook just the chicken breasts instead. Very yummy and makes great sandwiches the next day!

I did not care for this recipe.  It had to me a terrible taste after sitting in the crock pot all day.  Maybe it was the flavor of BBQ sauce, but I just disliked it all around.  And my boyfriend hated the clean-up.  So I will not be making this again.

This was so easy and so good. The only thing I did different was remove the skin / fat from the chicken, sprinkled with Lowery's garlic salt, and used Everglades Moppin' and Grillin' sauce. I have four kids from 2 to 14 and they loved it.

I followed the advice and previous personal experience about bone-in chicken and used boneless chicken breasts. The meal burned so badly that I had to throw my crock pot away and buy a new one. I'll not try this recipe again!

The dark meat was good but the white meat was icky mushy.  I think it just cooked in to much liquid for to long.  I did trim the fat and remove the skin (a very unpleasant process) I used the recommended amout of sauce.  Next time I will follow the Baked slow cooker chicken recipe from this site and just season the chicken and brush with BBQ sauce.  It was nice to smell and taste BBQ in February in Michigan!

This could not be easier. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this the other night for my family and everyone loved it. It was so easy and very good. The chicken literally fell off the bone. I will definitely be making this again.

Instead of using a whole chicken, I bought breasts, thighs and wings.  In addition to the honey barbeque sauce I added in about 1/2 cup of honey.  My family loved it.  It was so easy and delicious!

I cooked a 4.5 pound chicken (with sauce rubbed under the skin and the rest poured over the bird) all day on low with some mustard style BBQ sauce. The meat was very tender and fell off the bone but a little dry so I decided to shred the meat and pour the leftover cooked sauce (skimmed off some of the fat) over the meat. I spiked it with a good dose of white vinegar since we like BBQ on the tangy side. That fixed the dry problem and it turned out very yummy!

WOW.  This was really really good!  I'm wondering if the type of b-b-q sauce used makes the difference?  I used "HP" sauce with a wee bit of water.  It was perfect. We'll do this one again!

This chicken recipe was so easy and I thought it was really good. It was so tender.......the meat just fell apart. I like the idea of using the crockpot instead of my oven. I diluted the barbecue sauce like one person suggested but next time I will definitely not do that again......... you really need the full flavor of the sauce.  you could also add any extra flavorings if you   wanted.  when served I poured the sauce on the chicken. This added tremendously to the taste . I'm sure I will make this recipe again.

I just started learning how to use the slow cooker.  This was a perfect starter meal.  Really easy and delecious.  I am now hooked because of this recipe.  The meat just fell off the bone.  I used the entire bottle of BBQ sauce.  Maybe that is why mine didn't turn out dry.  I will be making this dish again and again.

I skinned the chicken and put it on a few vegetables. The sauce turned out watery and bland. The chicken tasted all right, but there wasn't a lot of flavor. I'll probably look for a different recipe.

I took the skin off by advice of another reviewer, but the bbq sauce was still watery.  I don't think it would have made much of a difference if I left the skin on.  The taste was very mild.  I loved it, but the rest of the family prefers a stronger flavor.

This is one of my husband's very favourite dinners, and best of all, he makes it himself!!!  So easy, just throw it in the pot and forget it.  Tender, juicy meat with a wonerful flavour throughout.
