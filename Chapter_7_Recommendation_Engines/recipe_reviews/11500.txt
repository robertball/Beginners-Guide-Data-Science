A very nice cookie, extremely light and crisp.  A few notes: make sure the nuts are very finely chopped;  I also needed far more than just a half a cup to roll the cookies in.  Adding the cocoa makes a delicious cookie, but it's misleading to call it 'brownie like' .  If you're not fond of nuts or don't have them on hand, the cocoa version is good even without them, especially if you mix a small amount of cinnamon into the sugar that you roll them in.  Lastly, I usually refrigerate sugar cookie doughs before I shape them, to make them easier to handle, but don't do that with this recipe;  the dough is soft, but manageable, and it holds the nuts better at room temperature.

Makes a very delicious and tender cookie. I added chopped nuts directly to the dough and rolled in cinnamon sugar, topping with a few additional nuts. Other ideas are to top with chocolate kisses or add chocolate chips to the dough. Cookies do spread, I would suggest placing about 3" apart. Baked for 9-10 minutes just until light brown.

This is a very good basic cookie. I made them per the recipe, but left off the nuts as I was out.  I believe they would be even better with almond extract to give them a decidedly Swedish flare.  Bake untill they are light brown around the edges and they will melt in your mouth.  Great with tea or coffee.

I am definitely a novice, but I'm very pleased with the results of this recipe....Now let's see what my family thinks.  This is the first time I have ever baked a Christmas cookie...I used the 1/3 cup cocoa, and everything else was according to Barbara's recipe.

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night/day.

These are simple, but delicious! Instead of walnuts, I used almonds (just personal preference) and also rolled them in cinnamon to give them more flavor. I really really like them with the cinnamon, though I think they would be good without it as well. Be careful not to overbake. My first batch was a little crispy.

followed suggestions of using cinnamon sugar and rolling dough into hazelnut size balls (1/2 tablespoon measuring spoon gave just the right size IMO) and they turned out beautiful.  I usually chill my dough so it doesn't spread too much but this dough was fine baking at room temp.  on parchment paper.

Very good basic cookie.  I started with chopped walnuts and cut them down further.  I liked it that way.  I also rolled the cookies in red sugar for Christmas.  These will make it into regular rotation for cookie exchanges.

I made these cookies last year for my son's Language class & they were a hit.  So this year my son asked me to make them again, but I have to make extra because my daughter loved them too.  Very easy to make.

My family and I made these cookies for Christmas and they were DELICIOUS!!!!! I rolled them in  almonds because that was the only thing we had on hand but they were still great!!! My 11 year old daughter kept sneaking them from the kitchen so there aren't many left. They melt in your mouth! Very good!!!!!

This is a simple recipee and FULL of flavor.  Definitely use cinnamon-sugar, instead of plan sugar.  It makes a HUGE difference!

These cookies were delicious.  The raw dough wasn't that tasty so I was unsure of the final product but, boy was I surprised!  I used pecans instead and and sprinkled green sugar for decoration.  My husband ate them up!!

Whoops! sent wrong review.
These cookies do not need to be chilled! I added cocoa like suggested and they turned out great. I also used almonds instead of walnuts.

Very light and crisp. I didn't use any nuts, because my family is allergic to them, and i also used 1/3 cup cocoa powder and 1 tbsp cinnamon. The end result tasted like a graham cracker, but it was good because i like graham crackers.

So, I didn't use the nuts which probably just made them into regular sugar cookies, but sometimes I feel like a nut and sometimes I don't . . . seriously, I was just being lazy at the time.  I often am.  But anyway, these do bake up a tad crisp and they crinkle.  I love it when cookies do that!  I have no idea why, but I do.  I think they are adorable, and you could roll them in any kind of sugar.  I have several containers of random colored sugar I bought last year for some project, so I played around with the sugar colors.  They baked up readily for me in 10 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent cookie.  I used a red colored sugar sprinkle for the holidays in place of the white sugar and they looked really pretty, too.

I feel like I omitted the "Swedish" part of these crisps since I didn't put any nuts in it. Regardless, these were absolutely amazing. They're so light and fluffy. They were so rich in flavour too without being overly sweet too. Much better than any kind of sugar cookie I've ever had. I had to make a second batch since they went so fast!

This is a wonderful recipe.  The cookies are nutty and delicious.  I rolled mine in colored sugar to make them more festive for holiday gifts.  I also used 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts.  It seemed to need more nuts because the dough is soft.  As my last pan is baking, I am mixing up another turn because I know I'll need more of these.

Made about 5 dozen. I used about 1 cup of finely chopped pecans and about 1/2 cup sugar. Whole family loves them, including husband and 2 teenage girls! Will definitely make this recipe often.

Easy basic cookie, good texture and taste. I might try adding lemon zest and extract for the next time.

I have made these a few times, added the cocoa to a few batches too. They really do taste like brownies. I didn't have nuts the first time I made these but my Swedish SIL said they were still good. Thank you for submitting this recipe Barbara

These are very tasty cookies. Wish I had read the comments before using vanilla. Would have used almond to make them more authentic to Sweden. Hopefully my sons teacher will forgive us.
