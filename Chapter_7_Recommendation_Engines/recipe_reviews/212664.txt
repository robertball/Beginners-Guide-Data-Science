I put in about a cup each of carrots and celery, finely dicing the carrots and cooking them along with the onions. Used whole milk rather than half-and-half. No almonds. So, pretty true to the recipe overall. It tasted amazing, and I will definitely make it again.

This soup is AWESOME!  I only made a few moderations to the recipe.  I excluded the almonds, salt (used a little bit of garlic salt w/parsley), and added one cup of half-and-half.  The consistency was great and it had excellent flavor!  My family loved it!  This is certainly a "keeper"!

This is a great recipe. I wanted to use my leftovers without going to the store. I did this but I had to change the recipe a little bit. For the turkey broth I used my leftover gravy and I added 2 cups of water to that.  I used  1 percent milk instead of half and half. I also used a packet of cheddar potato soup mix by Bear Creek. I have to say this soup was better than any soup I have ever had at any resteraunt. I am making one more batch in a couple days and freezing it for a cold winter night.

This recipe was delicious! The only change I made, because my husband does not really like pieces of cooked onion or celery in soup, is that I pureed the soup in a blender right before adding the rice and turkey. The result was incredible...it made the broth even creamier than before and silky smooth. Delicious!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I only made a couple of changes - added sliced mushrooms and fresh parsley.  I didn't have enough turkey stock and used chicken broth...it still came out delicious!

This soup is the BEST! I did change a little - used Rice-A-Roni long grain & wild rice instead of uncooked, and didn't add the lemon juice (I will try that one day) but I made two batches with all my leftover turkey. I have 12 portions frozen for lunches - YUM!

We had this tonight from smoked turkey leftovers; hubby went back for seconds, and the kids (10, 12) loved it. I served it with sliced French bread, brushed with melted butter and baked at 400 for 10 mins. Nice job! This is a keeper! The lemon juice added a touch of "brightness" to the dish.

this is delicious. Extra veggies don't hurt!  And for lack of half//half and cream, I used 2 percent milk. The lemon is a good addition.

This was a nice option for using up the last of the Thanksgiving day turkey. Warm, creamy and filling. The only reason I didn't give 4 stars is that I followed the directions to a tee and found it was really lacking in seasoning (for my taste and that may just be a regional difference). Otherwise, my Dad and I really enjoyed it! Thanks for listing!

soup turned out tasty. enjoyed the texture and how much more like a meal it was than turkey soups past.  Does need more broth than called for in recipe if you want it more soup-like and not stew-like.  definite keeper for next post-thanksgiving  leftover parade!

This soup was delicious! We did add a little thyme, a chicken boullion cube and a little more salt. We also used Grandmas noodles II instead of rice and didn't add the almonds since my daughter hates nuts.

Very yummy and a great way to use up turkey leftovers! As per another review I upped the measurements of celery, carrots, and onion to 1 cup each. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! We didn't have any half and half or milk, so I added a can of cream of chicken soup and used chicken bouillon instead of turkey broth.

This soup is so delicious! The only change I made was substituting the turkey broth with chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. It was so good and easy! My husband raved about it and requested that I make another batch the next day! My 8 year old said it was the best soup he'd ever had. Even my very picky 10 yr old said it was pretty good!! That's saying a lot coming from him, because he doesn't like much!

I made this turkey soup last year and couldn't wait to make it again with this year's leftover Christmas turkey.  We made a few changes last year and replicated the changes this year because it was so delicious!  We didn't have celery, so, added the same amount of finely chopped broccoli and cauliflower.  I also added Pot Herbs and Bouquet Garni.  I picked the good turkey from the turkey leftovers and boiled the turkey carcass for a couple of hours and picked a little more.  We also used brown rice instead of white.  The best turkey soup ever without a doubt!!!

Thank you Galynn! I was fretting over what i was going to cook for my family before I head out to work @ 5pm. Frankly, I started out looking for a hamb-based recipe when I came upon this one & realized I had all of the ingredients! It came together fast & easy & tastes like I slaved over the stove all day (shh...our secret!). Honestly, I could have left it alone as a turkey/rice soup before adding the half-and-half. The half-and-half makes it taste more like a chowder - both ways are delicious!

I lost my wild rice soup recipe and this very close! Love it.  I did add less turkey only 1 cup.  The flavors are great!  I did not have  trouble adding the flour, you have to just keep whisking and not on high heat.  I also used a little less rice I had cooked the whole 4oz box and just added as I thought was right.  Thank you so much the one I had added diced ham and chicken.  I will try that next time with your recipe too.  Comfort food on a cold day!

Great recipe.  Made exactly as recipe called, except minor changes: used a basmati rice mixture from Trader Joe's, shunned the almonds, and added chopped water chestnuts.  I also added a bit more broth (chicken) than called for and chopped/diced the carrots instead of shredding and softened them along with the onions and celery.  Seriously, very very good recipe.  Highly recommend.

I doubled the butter and flour and turkey stock. Added mixed vegetables and left out the half and half, lemon and almonds. Delicious and less calories with more veggies.

Delicious and easy!! What a great way to use holiday leftovers! Although, we had no wild rice, so we used long grain rice instead and just followed the package's instructions to cook. It turned out great!

This was a fantastic soup!!  I made it mostly as written, although I doubled the celery, onion and finely chopped about 6 carrots (small, heirloom ones from my garden).  I sauteed the carrots with the other vegs, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Awesome!

Really good.  I didn't have the almonds so I left them out and it was still good.  I used chopped carrots instead of shredded and whole milk instead of cream and loved it.  Maybe a post-Thanksgiving tradition!

This was really good on a cold Texas day, which we do get once in a while!  I left out the lemon juice and used lemon pepper for my seasoning.  Didn't even realize until later in the day that I had forgotten to add the cream and it still was very good!  Saved a few calories too!

This was the best turkey soup I have ever had.  What a great way to use up a turkey!  I used double the carrots and way too much turkey but wow it was good!  Thanks

I made this with our leftover turkey and turkey stock from our Christmas dinner. Unfortunately I didn't have any celery or almonds, but did have a bunch of baby portabella mushrooms that needed to be used, so sliced them and tossed in with the other veggies. Used a bit more veggies than 1/4 cup of each (whole onion, 4 scallions, two carrots, and 8 oz. of mushrooms), but I still kept the other measurements the same. I did add in a bit more spices, first celery seed since I didn't have that, and a few shakes of poultry seasoning, dried parsley, garlic powder. The soup was perfect tasting, seems many  soup recipes add way too much flour and butter, but the balance made just the right consistency and not over powering floury taste. Will use this recipe as my base from now on for turkey soup. By the way chicken stock would work just as well if you don't have turkey stock.

I love this soup, I used all the same ingredients except almonds, not really a fan!! The flavors are amazing, I also followed another review I read and used my immersion blender to make the soup have an  smoother base, I also avoided the taste of eating whole pieces of cooked celery which no one in my family likes!!! I will be making this every time I roast a turkey, or chicken!!! And FYI I cooked a small turkey in the crock pot for this recipie!!!

Great base recipe.  Upped the carrots & celery to 1 cup (diced).  Also, added some chopped mushrooms and 2-3 cups more of stock.  Spices added:  thyme, rosemary, sage and curry.  Used 1% milk instead of cream.  Really nice flavor and family friendly.  Recommend giving this one a try!

Excellent, but very rich! I left out the almonds, though, and it was fine. Used chicken stock and upped the veggies as other reviewers suggested. Just great!

This was absolutely fantastic!  I made it with turkey tenderloins I got from the butcher at the grocery store. I substituted broccoli for the celery, and chicken broth for the turkey stock.  I will definitely be trying this again with Thanksgiving leftovers!

This was wonderful.  It was great to use the leftover Turkey meat from Thanksgiving.  I used Chicken Stock instead of Turkey Stock as I was all out of Turkey Stock and was not in the mood for making more.  Other than that followed the recipes exactly and it came out delicious.

Very Good! Best Wild Rice soup I have made.  I made a few changes to make it gluten free for my family by adding brown rice flour instead of reg flour and used GF chicken stock.  Could not tell the difference.  Also added the carrots in with the onion and celery for time sake and left out the almonds.

Fabulous! Made enough for me to freeze for a later dinner since it is just my hubby and me. I love the variation that can be made by adding different vegetables. We are definitely keeping this in the winter dinner rotation.

Galynn, this is delicious!  Wow, we loved it!  It used up our leftover turkey and gravy (2.5 c. gravy + 1.5 c. water).  It worked great!  We used diced carrots and 1/2 c. sour cream in place of the half and half.  Such a forgiving, flexible recipe.  The almond flavor wasn't very noticeable, but it gave a nice texture to the soup.  Served it with fresh bread.  Mmm, can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

Oh, my word. Wow. I just roasted a pre-Thanksgiving turkey and made a triple batch of this soup for our large family.  Before we ate it, I just kept testing it and testing it- it's that good!! This is a super flavorful recipe; one we'll be returning to often. BTW, I added mushrooms and left out the almonds, but I may add them next time. Mmmmmmm...

Wow!  I just made this awesome soup and just had the last taste-test before serving. It is sooo good and easy.  I know it is destine to be a family favorite.  I added a touch some salt and pepper and used heavy cream (left over from New Years cooking) instead of half and half.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent soup and my hubby said I hit a home run with this recipe ~ it's a keeper!  Used Swanson chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. I added extra onion, carrots & celery as a personal preference.  Will definitely make again when we have left over turkey.  Thanks for sharing!

delicious! i used roasted chicken, as i had almost half of one leftover, along with the carrots, celery, onions and mushrooms that had been roasted along originally. took the larger pieces of veg and cut them up. i cooked the rice and added it to the chicken and veg. everything else i followed as directed: made a roux and whisked in the broth, then dumped the rice-chicken-veg mix in. let it warm and added in the lemon juice and half & half. the almonds are really delicious in this. thank you so much. i'm so bad about letting roasted chicken/turkey go to waste.  now i have lunch for the rest of the week!

Fantastic! Easy to make and great for leftover thanksgiving turkey.  You could easily make this with rotisserie chicken and chicken broth.  I added minced garlic to the onion/celery sauté.  I did put this in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours After whisking the broth into the rue and then added chopped portobellos to cook down. I added the half and half at the end along with a little more turkey broth.  it was very good! I’ll be making it again and also plan to make a vegetarian version with veggie broth, zucchini and mushrooms.

My only change was using evaporated milk in place of the half and half, because, well, that’s what I do! I was leery of almonds and lemon juice in soup, but I always do recipes true as written the first time. Then I can mess around with it! Which I will not do with this one; it was perfect as written. Thanks for sharing; this will be a go-to with Thanksgiving leftovers!

Great recipe! basically started with doubling the recipe...why not? boiled 3 Turkey legs with salt, pepper. and 3 bay leaves to make stock and have Turkey meet (cooked legs had plenty of meat). Used margarine to saute onions and celery. Added garlic (again, why not?). As another reviewer mentioned, I added the carrots to then end of the saute to help soften quicker. if you don't have enough Turkey broth, just use low sodium chicken broth to make up the difference
 I used fat free half-and-half. I really liked the almonds. Doubled the lemon juice as it really brightened all the flavors. Yum!!!

Delicious, and easy! Great recipe! I doubled the veggies, didn’t have half and half or almonds so used 2% milk and no almonds. Great recipe as written, I think it would be yummy with some mushrooms too. Thanks for the recipe! It’s definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  I had trouble finding a small container of wild rice at my local grocery store, so I followed another reviewer' suggestion and purchased the wild rice blend from Rice-A-Roni. I used 2 boxes because I like a lot of rice, and just tossed the seasoning in the garbage. It was inexpensive and worked perfectly!  I also added  a few more veggies than called for as well as a 1/2 tablespoon of "Sunny Paris" seasoning from Penzey's Spices.

Very delicious! Made it with chicken broth and some leftover turkey gravy since I didn't have turkey broth. Didn’t have half and half but used half heavy whipping cream and half 2% milk. Next time, I would up the amount of celery to 1 cup.

I made this for a ladies luncheon. Several ladies had seconds, everyone said it was really good and one lady asked for the recipe. I omitted the lemon juice, bacon and almonds. I cooked the wild rice with chicken bouillon added to the water.  Added some sliced mushrooms to the soup. I also used only whole milk (being careful not to boil the soup) as liquid for this soup.

This is a great recipe the way it is but I added a few things to make it my own.        First I left out the almonds.  I felt the wild rice had plenty of texture.  Secondly sheerly for the extra calories I substituted whole milk for the cream and increased it to two cups.  And third I added two cups of sautéed mushrooms and 1/2 cup dry sherry.    So delicious!

Fantastic. This recipe has become a Thanksgiving tradition for our family. I always make a double batch. Don’t leave out the lemon or half and half finish as it hits knocks this out of the park. Also try leftover dressing instead of crackers or bread. Yum. Many thanks to the contributor of this one.

Fantastic soup!   I use 6 cups of stock, 1 cup of half and half, one cup or wild rice. And probably 3 cups or more of shredded cooked chicken or turkey.

I've been making this soup since 2014 when a good friend recommended to me.  Last night I added mushrooms and instead of turkey added rotisserie chicken and doubled the liquid because I added the entire chicken and whole box of cooked wild rice.  Also, I only put 1/4 cup butter and 4 T flour. It was delicious as always!  No fail recipe.

Loved this soup.  Used the leftovers from my turkey dinner including using the gravy to enhance the broth called for and a box of long-grain and wild rice, but left out the almonds (don't like them).  Just the right balance of creamy and comforting.

Excellent base recipe that really helped me in my first adventure making a wild rice soup. Going thru many of the comments I found very helpful. The vegetable portions for about 5 cups of liquid seemed too small so I too went for a cup of celery and finally chopped carrots. Added some more onion as well. I did all the veggies in the butter (carrots included) and added a few cloves of garlic just long enough to become aromatic. I added about another cup of turkey broth (used the carcass from my Christmas turkey to make it). Also with the wild rice I added a teaspoon of Better than Boullion chicken broth mix into the water for a bit more flavour. Other minor tweaks were some more salt, pepper, dried thyme and about 3 tsps of lemon juice. To finish it off I let it simmer in the slow cooker for a few hours to blend the flavours. Tastes great but my guess is it will even better tomorrow. Thanks again

I found this recipe to be quite delicious, though I would add a bit more seasoning when making again. I actually skipped the cream and the lemon, for no reason except that i forgot. -- I did not find the result lacking in creaminess at all.

The soup is quite hearty, almost stew like -- a potage? It's a great way to use up turkey leftovers from thanksgiving or christmas etc...

It was pretty good.  Only change I made was I used fat free heavy cream and added mushrooms.  We made a garlic ciabatta bread to dip into it.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I doubled it and added some mushrooms.  I even made my own turkey stock.  It was good, but a little bland.  I may consider adding a little sherry next time as it does turn out so creamy.

We really enjoyed this soup and found it to be a good way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.  I had gravy left over from Thanksgiving, so I used it instead of making the roux with flour and butter.  Then I added enough broth until the soup was the right consistency.  It turned out great!

Excellent.   I had to double the recipe as I had a lot of broth and leftover turkey.  I diced the carrots and cooked with celery and onion as someone else suggested.   I also had some fresh thyme leftover and threw that in the soup as well.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

The others who ate it thought it was ok.  I had to add way more onions, pepper and garlic than listed.  I felt 1/2 tsp of lemon juice in that much soup was pretty much a waste of time so I put in 2 tsp.  I added double the amount or more, of veggies.  I felt the soup was still lacking in flavour and I needed to add some chicken bouillon powder, white wine and Maggie just to try and help it.  Very disappointed as the picture looked nummy.  It was easy enough to make when compared to any other  homemade soup but I do not feel the quantities of the things that would add flavour were correct.  I will not make this again.

This soup yields a really nice broth with simple ingredients I always keep on hand. I did add more celery/onions and added more chopped carrots with them instead of the grated. The flour still cooked nicely even with the extra produce. I think the butter:flour:half and half ratios are perfect, I won't change them at all in the future. Thanks so much for sharing :)

This ended up being more like turkey pot pie filling, but if you don't mind your soup being really thick, this has great flavor. (I even used 2% milk instead of cream and added more milk than the recipe called for, and it was still thick.) Also skipped the butter (not needed) and sauteed a cup of each veggie - carrots, celery and onion in olive oil first. Will definitely make again.

I didn't have sold rice so I used white rice.  Wild rice would be better.    I would use less half and half next time so the flavors would come out more.  Everyone ate it all up and it tasted good.

I used the exact ingredients & measurements, except I used evaporated skim milk instead of half & half.  I don't think the richness suffered a bit, & it cut fat & calories!  I will definitely make this again!  Delicious!

I made it with turkey leftovers and enjoyed it. My toddler liked it too.

I did half turkey, half chicken broth, and used a Rice a roni for the wild rice. Used whole milk instead of half and half. Served with dinner rolls and it was a nice meal.

Very good. I might want a little more kick to it in the future, and it's heavy with the cream. But it was a nice change to normal broth and I'd make it again.

I thought this was good, but it seemed to be missing something.  I finally put a bit of cranberry sauce on mine and that made it wonderful.  Others who ate it thought it was really good and a nice change from the normal Turkey Noodle Soup on the day after Thanksgiving.

I used uncle bens 2 minute express wild rice and it turned out great. cut off so much cooking time. I was able to make it and eat during my lunch break.  I love how the almonds give it a delicious crunch. I added some garlic salt because it found it was lacking in flavour. I also used chicken broth because I could not find any turkey broth. This is a great recipe to make with left over turkey from the holidays.  Even a hit with the kids!!

This soup recipe is a  perfect base to go crazy with!  I use Better Than Bouillon brand turkey soup base (so much richer than stock in a box or worse yet, bouillon cubes. Which are essentially sodium and msg cubes with a tad of broth taste). They also have roast chicken, roast beef, ham and vegetable flavored-all excellent and worth the $6.00 or so price point per 8 ounce jar. No wild rice in my pantry so I decided to put together a mixture-used brown rice, white rice and a 3 color variety of quinoa.  Added poultry seasoning (parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme-per the song!) minced onions, carrots shredded, dried minced celery and a generous cubed amount of a Costco brand shrink wrapped roasted turkey breast-exceptional value at $3.99 lb-may have been a grand opening special price., regardless, a great price with no waste.  Cooked, covered on medium low, checkingthe seasonings after 45 minutes. At this point I checked the rice/turkey/quinoa   amount in the stock. I like my soup with plenty of broth but want each ladle to have a good amount of "substance".  If needed, add broth, rice, quinoa and/or turkey and continue to cook a bit. I rarely have cream on hand or half and half (both of which I prefer in place of milk) but seeing others often use milk in place of cream, I too use it--granted it's not nearly as rich but ultimately better for you. Make a little roux of flour/cold water, and whisk in your pot. Hard bread/crackers complete this delicious, hearty, healthy soup!

Fabulous! I've made this recipe numerous times.
A family favorite; dinner guests rave over it.
I always make a triple batch to have enough & freeze a few single servings for meals on busy days. We like extra almonds for more crunch.

This is a great recipe to make post-Thanksgiving.  It is easy to vary the vegetables and spices, based on what you have on hand.  I've shared this with many others, and have always decided good reviews!

My gut told me not to add the lemon juice, I did it anyway and regretted it. It made the soup too bright. The family thought it was okay, but no one went back for seconds.  During dinner I remembered what I love about my other turkey and wild rice soup recipe- mushrooms! I sliced some up, sauteed, added them to soup and voila! Instant deliciousness. Mushrooms added the depth of flavor and earthiness I was looking for.

Our favorite turkey soup for holiday leftovers!  I really enjoy the wild rice instead of noodles.  I like to add frozen peas for a little more veggies and have substituted evaporate milk for the half and half when I didn't have that on hand.  Freezes well too; I make a double batch and freeze half to pull out and enjoy about a month later.

I used mostly used the dark drumstick meat that our family doesn't really like just on its own. I also had some extra mushrooms we didn't use on Thanksgiving, so I sauteed those and threw them in.  Worked great. The whole meal was delicious. It's like a rich, thick, creamy turkey "chowder." Very flavorful.

This soup is amazing!  I have made it twice now - the first time we made it exactly as written. Since we smoked our turkey this year, I made some adjustments.  Of course, I like my own version better, but I had to give it five stars anyway because it is a great soup without any adjustments.  My alterations were simple - I sliced the carrots instead of shredding them (we like the texture better), doubled all the veggies, and added the smoked turkey after the broth is added. I also added fresh thyme and let it simmer for about twenty minutes.  Those were the only changes I made.  I noticed that a lot of reviewers skipped the almonds.  I LOVE this addition. If you've never tried it, try stirring them into your serving at the table. It adds such a wonderful and unique texture.  You might be hooked after you've tried it once!  I was!  I also really enjoy the lemon.  This soup has a complex taste and is not too rich.  If you think it's a little bland, add more pepper.  It really enhances the other flavors.  Because I used smoked turkey (I would HIGHLY recommend using smoked turkey, by the way), I did not add any additional salt and we didn't need it. This one is a keeper.

We really like this recipe and make it every year after Thanksgiving.  I have learned that we prefer some more seasoning to the soup so I tend to add some garlic powder, thyme, marjoram or whatever else is around.  I also add about a cup of carrots and celery.  

Highly recommend doubling the recipe as it gets us our family of 4 through 1 1/2 meals.

This post-turkey soup is now a family favorite...and we are soup-making lovers :)! The toasted almonds gave the soup a wonderful hint of nutty that was the icing on the cake. Will make this after every turkey for our family with five boys!

This is now my favorite soup. As does everyone else, I made some adjustments. I chop onion and celery and sauté with butter. then add flour when they are just soft, add chicken bullion or, I prefer chicken stock. Then stir in flour and add turkey broth. Stir till thickened then add chopped carrot and simmer until almost tender, add turkey & rice. Simmer about 10 MN then add 1/2 & 1/2 & lemon. Awesome with freshly baked bread.

We made a couple of minor changes.  Like some others we diced the carrots and sauteed them with the onions and celery.  Because my husband prefers soups not to be too stew like, I used 6 cups of chicken broth (instead of 4) and I added a little garlic powder.  But, I think that what changed it the most is that I squirted in some Sriracha Sauce at the very end (hubby likes things spicy).  I also used FF half and half.  My husband said "this is the best thing I've ever made".  Like a number of others we did not add the almonds.

This was a little bland for our taste but after adding 1 tsp of Better Than Bullion and 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne, it was one of the best soups I've ever made. Also had some mushrooms that had been in the fridge for awhile so sliced them and threw them in there too. It was delicious.

Delicious!! I skipped the almonds because I thought I had some, but didnt! Best turkey soup recipe I've made. Wild rice is expensive ($6-$7/lb) but worth it. You really want that nutty, earthy, hearty rice in this. White or brown would not be the same!

Turned out just as I hoped it would. Perfect. I'm sure it is even better as written, I modified it a bit.  Swapped the butter for  1/4 c of olive oil, used  2% evap milk, added 1/4 c grated parm cheese and some chopped green beans. Oh and I just chopped the carrots and added them in with the onions and celery. Cooked it on a low boil for about a half hour when everything was in the pot. Nothing like a great bowl of homemade soup like this one ????

This soup is delicious. I used tapioca starch instead of flour to thicken it as I wanted it to be gluten free. I've made it twice in the last week, the second time adding mushrooms to the onion, celery, and carrot mixture. Yum!

Very good with flavored turkey stock from Cajun seasoned turkey. Did not have to add any spices.  Cut butter down to 2 teaspoons vs 6 tablespoons. Didn't miss or need it.  Used 1/2 cup fat free half and half and half and 1 cup skim milk. Doubled all the veggies. Soup was rich flavorful and delicious. Was able to lighten the recipe and did not sacrifice taste. Even hubby who hates turkey soup had 3 bowls

Used Chef John's recipe for roasted turkey, which was amazing. Made this soup today and took a shortcut by using packaged brown and wild rice with seasoning packet. Increased the veggies and left out the almonds. Very, very good (and rich) soup. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you.

I added extra onion, celery and started the carrots at the same time so they would be more tender. Delish

I've made this recipe many times and everytime it turns out delicious.  I follow the recipe pretty true to the original recipe.  Sometimes I substitute fat free half and half for real half and half and haven't noticed a significant change in the flavor.  The lemon adds a nice flavor.

Delicious! Subbed noodles for the wild rice to make it more kid-friendly. Didn't make enough for leftovers so next time I would double it. The kids loved it!

I make a lot of soups, and this one is a big favorite. Easy and tasty. Only changes -- added more onion, carrots and celery, about a cup of each, used black rice, and used whole milk to lower the fat. Next time, I will use 2- or 1-percent. Yummy!

One word, DELICIOUS! I added fresh thyme, parsley, mushrooms,extra vegetables from list, only had 2 cups turkey broth so added 2 cans low sodium chicken broth. My husband was skeptical but after 1 bite loved it! 
 While rice was simmering, I chopped vegetables and cut up the cooked turkey. The celery and carrots were not mushy but had little crunchy which we liked. Will definitely make this again.- Dee

Very good.  I substituted Turkey schmaltz for butter and added rosemary, thyme and sage to taste.  A hearty warm soup for cold weather days.

As is, it is just a good start.  I found it needed a bit of something so added a bit of sage and that did the trick to make it a keeper!

Very yummy, definitely a keeper.  Made exactly as written except for: 8oz sliced mushrooms(needed to use them up), about 3/4 cup each of onions, celery, and diced carrot.  Used fat-free half and half, 1cup, which gave it more of a chowdery feel as opposed to a thick soup. Omitted almonds, added a little Italian seasoning which gave it the ooomph it needed.  Next time I might use half butter/half broth at the beginning to cut fat down even more.  Very tasty.

Wonderful soup that helped use up some ingredients from Thanksgiving.  I made a portion without the H&H and almonds for a friend on a low-potassium diet, which was very good. But adding those ingredients really kicks it up a notch. I will definitely make it again.  That bit of lemon is genius! P.S. I made the wild rice the night before, which made putting it all together a snap.

Used black rice bc I didn't have wild rice. My roux didn't come out as it usually does which is why the flavor was off to me.

Second time trying this and used roasted chicken meat in place of turkey.  Used brown rice, and doubled onions, carrots and celery (cooked carrots with onions and celery), and didn't add the slivered almonds.  Again, this soup is so flavorful and has become one of our top two soups!

I excluded the almonds and used leftover smoked turkey.  I prefer a creamier base and probably would have gotten that if I had used half and half instead of the 2% I had on hand.  I pureed the cooked onions and celery as one reviewer suggested but had issues cooking the flour.  Would recommend cooking the flour separately, adding the pureed veggies, then the stock.  Definitely needed the extra spices as others suggested.  I added rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic.  A good warm you up meal :)  **Next day had to add more turkey stock and milk as the rice had soaked up too much of the broth.  Good thing I made it in advance.

I LOVE this soup!!  Everyone I know LOVED the soup.  My husband hates soup and turkey, but he loved it too!  The only things I did differently was that I like to use the body of the turkey, the bones and all.  I let it cook with all the veggies, broth, and spices for about an hour.  Then I added the milk and rice at the end.  I also added more veggies as I like a hardier soup to fill me.

This was really good.  We used a combo of white and wild rice but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe as is - very warming and satisfying meal with bread and a salad.

I love this recipe. It's delicious, easy peasy to make and it is really inexpensive. Never throw away another chicken/turkey carcass without first making broth from it. If you start out with a good free-range bird, you'll end up in soup heaven when you taste this soup.

SO good and easy to make. However, I followed all of the measurements and this only served about 4 people, not 8. What I did differently was used homemade chicken stock, used a roasted chicken from the store (skinned and pulled off the bones), and added a sprig of thyme and rosemary (finely chopped). I also used skim milk and omitted the lemon juice since I thought it tasted fantastic before adding it. In addition to the veggies listed, I added some sliced mushrooms and the final product is WONDERFUL!

I thought this turned out really well! I didn't add the almonds and I only had 2 cans of chicken broth that measured out to be exactly 3 cups so I added one 1 cup of water with a heaping tablespoon of this chicken bouillon paste that I had in my cupboard. All in all it turned out great.

Good soup.  Made 12 servings to match the 3 cups of turkey I had, plus a brown rice, black barley, radish seed mix from Trader Joes.  Increased the amount of celery to a cup and included a small chopped zucchini for more veggies.  Finished with sliced almonds and 2% milk since I didn't have 1/2 n 1/2 on hand.  Nice light soup even though a white cream base.

This was fine for leftover turkey, but it was more of a chowder than a soup.  I liked it, although it needed some spices, but my husband and daughter found the wild rice to be too chewy, even though it had cooked the proper amount of time, plus some.

This soup was wonderful. My entire family ate it, even my picky 5 year olds.  I did add a tsp of gound rosemary and used chicken stock instead of turkey stock.  But definitely a do over!

Ummmm...really good!!  I made broth from our left-over Thanksgiving turkey and also added our left-over gravy.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written but used 3 packages of the 90-second Uncle Ben's microwave wild and brown rice (...microwaved it before adding).  Delicious!!  It was a hit with our family and guests!!

Fabulous soup recipe.  I substituted chicken for the turkey and I use a boxed wild rice mix with the seasoning packet. My husband loved it!

I used peas for my vegetable, I didn't have the rest on hand. I also added some garlic to it. It turned out so yummy!

This soup was delicious!  Filling, creamy, and flavorful. I will be making it again.  I doubled the amount of onions and celery, and I did not add the almonds- they just didn't appeal to me.  I also simmered the soup with a turkey leg bone for added flavor and removed it before adding the half and half- yum!

I substituted 1/2 cup sour cream for the full cream and had no almonds to add, but followed the rest of the recipe as-is.  Wonderful soup; I'll definitely be making this again.

This was fantastic, but came out just a little thick for my liking. Next time I'll try reducing the butter/oil and flour used by half. I'll be making this again and again!

My family absolutely loved this soup!  I did not have turkey broth, so used Swanson's Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth instead.  We cannot have dairy, so substituted Lactaid Non-Fat Milk and the soup was tremendous.

Wonderful recipe, I like adding the almonds. Serve with warm homemade wheat bread, wine and cheese and you will have an absolutely perfect meal for a cold midwinter day!

This was wonderful! I had left over chicken breast and wild rice to use, so this was a super easy recipe and great way to use it up. I love my wild rice soup to be really thick, so I used more of every ingredient especially the veggies. I also used 1 cup of the half and half. My husband loved it and requested using ham in the recipe next time so I'll probably try that next. I will absolutely be doing this one again!

This was really good.  I made the recipe as written except I used 2 c. more turkey broth and 1 c. whipping cream instead of half and half.  Very very good!
