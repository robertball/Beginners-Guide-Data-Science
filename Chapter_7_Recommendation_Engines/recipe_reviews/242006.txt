I really liked it. Was super easy to make. I used my pressure cooker instead of a crockpot. Mine came out more red than pictured in the recipe.

No changes; only fair.  Probably will not make it again.  Just did not taste like a curry.  Somewhat disappointing.

Made it just as the recipe states but instead of cauliflower used broccoli.  This is so easy and flavorful.  Will definitely make it again.

We really loved how easy this was to make, and we loved the flavor. We didnâ€™t add the raisins, but we stayed true to the recipe otherwise.
