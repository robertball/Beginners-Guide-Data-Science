I cooked the onions and peppers with the hamburger so I didn't need the olive oil. Also after reading the previous review I added garlic salt and onion powder to the hamburger too. I didn't have jalepenos so I sprinkled in some cayenne pepper. My husband ate enough to feed 3 people. We also sprinkled the cheese on our own servings instead of mixing it in. We enjoyed. Thanks Moose!

I seasoned the ground beef with Worcestershire sauce and grill seasoning to add some additional flavor.  Then I removed the browned ground beef from the pan and cooked the potatoes, peppers and onion in the drippings until the potatoes were tender (adding a couple cloves of minced garlic to the mix).  I used mozarella instead of cheddar (only a half cup or so) and the kids couldn't get enough!

While the recipe itself may be good (have not made it) I find the name very misleading. I thought it would be a recipe for a dry mix you can make yourself to replicate the over-priced store bought mixes.

If you try this you have to really think about how you want to spice it up. I added many seasonings to this and also ended up adding a little Velveeta for creaminess.

Not bad a good recipe to use as a base and customize for your own tastes or to use whatever is on hand. I added some taco seasoning and some corn.

This recipe was good however I made the following changes: I added 3 potatoes (6 total). I used sweet white onions instead of red. I replaced milk and jalepeno with 1/2 can tomato soup. I cooked the potatoes first then browned the ground beef. It was very good! It's great to have an alternative to all of the preservatives and additives in the boxed version. Now to find a homemade recipe for HB Helper using noodles!

This was a great start of a wonderful meal. I browned the meat garlic & onions together while the potatoes boiled. Added cumin chili powder salt & pepper to the meat. If I had a can of rotel that's what I would've added but I had a can of tomatoes & a few green chilies so I put that in. I also added a can of corn and a can of ranch style beans (all drained) then added the potatoes back to the pot and let it simmer for a few minutes. We put cheese on top of that and voilà... Seconds for everyone!!

Not my favorite recipe and I added spices I could not immagine making without any garlic or garlic powder. I put it inside a tortilla for my toddler and it gave it a little more edible texture.

This was pretty good as a base recipe. I added more potatoes than called for. Also seasoned the meat with taco seasoning cumin and added green chilies along with the jalapeno. Really wish I would have had some tortillas on hand because this would make a nice filling.

This ended up being delicious but I deviated from the original recipe by adding about a teaspoon of garlic powder onion powder salt black pepper and hot paprika. I also added Two red chilis because I had no jalapeños on hand as well as a quarter cup of water.

This was really bland it definitely needed some spice and more flavors. It was edible my family just dumped salt pepper cheese and salsa over it. I did like the combination of potatoes and beef though. If I were to make this again I would add 1-2 more bell peppers another jalapeno some tomato fresh cilantro cumin and garlic.

I put taco seasoning and sprinkled cayanne pepper on my batch too but I wish I had still added some more spice of some sort. I thinkn I might like it a little more runny too.

Really great idea. I added chopped up spaghetti noodles and rice since we had a bit leftover. I still added the potatoes after I broiled them with cheese. I added in green beans and corn. Tasted like we were supposed to be camping.

You will need to adjust the seasonings to your taste as others have recommended.  I went one step further, using penne pasta instead of potatoes  very tasty and goes together quickly.

I made this because it was a quick, cheap meal to throw together. 

 I took the suggestion of others and cooked the peppers and onion in the meat. I only had green pepper so I used thise instead of red. 

I boiled my potatoes for 5 minutes and then put them in my cast iron skillet with hot oil to brown the potatoes a little. 

I also had to add seasoning to this reciepe because what is listed is not enough for taste.

This was a great Saturday night supper. I used fresh ground turkey and didn't have regular potatoes so I used some tiny potatoes quartered.. There is a jalapeno pepper in the ingredient list but doesn't note when to use it. I just sauteed it with the red pepper and onion. I used a bit of avocado oil since the meat was so lean and added a dash of worcestershire sauce. Thank you for a great recipe. I will make it again.

This is one of those meals I grew up on. I prefer green pepper and white or yellow onion and if feeding kids who don't like spicy foods to leave out the fresh jalapeno.
