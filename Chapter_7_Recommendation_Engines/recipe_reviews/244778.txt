I make my own french vanilla creamer for coffee.  I ran out of cond milk and decided to try this out.  Way better than the canned stuff!  I did end up cooking it 5 hours in my little crockpot, but it's so nice to pour everything in and let it go.

Goodbye cans!

edited to add: I did use 2% milk which may be why it needed to cook longer

I make this often, using 3 cups organic whole milk and 1 cup organic cane sugar in a small cheap slow cooker.  I cook on high heat for an hour, stirring often, then turn it down to low for 4 - 5 hours.  The trick to get it to reduce is to not put the lid securely on the pot.  I put a double layer of paper towels, lay a wooden spoon or skewer toward one side of the pot and place the lid on top.  There needs to be a gap under the lid, so the water can evaporate from the milk.  Also, it works best with whole milk - regular or lactose free.  To check progress on the reduction, put a wooden skewer in the pot and measure the amount of liquid.  I use a marker  to mark the stick. Then you can stick the skewer in every hour or so to measure your progress.

This turned out way better then I thought before it cooled. I must say I used this in my coffee this morning and can't wait to try it in other things. It is thick and cream with a wonderful flavor. The time it took to make this was well worth it.

This was simple and easy.  Took about 3.5 hours in my slow cooker to reduce down to 1 1/4C (equivalent of can).  Only negative was that as it cooled, the butter separated out.  I was using mine in  a recipe right away, so was able to stir it back into slightly warm milk; would be more of a problem if you made this ahead and had it in the fridge.  Don't know that the butter is necessary, so may leave out next time.

Made this today. I used brown sugar instead of regular. I also used 2% milk, which a lot people said they had a problem with. I did not. Came out great, thick, and tasty. I’d recommend leaving the lid off, I made a big batch (4 servings);which wasn’t reducing in the croc, so I switched to the stovetop. For about half an hour, on medium, checking, to make sure it’s not burning. And don’t worry about the film on top. Then just blend it at the end. Made the process a lot quicker actually.

Didn't thicken after 4 hours in crockpot.  Butter separted from finished prpduct.  Used 2% since recipe did not specify so this may have been a factor.  Did well as coffee creamer.

I made this. Took 4 hours and 15 minutes in my little crock pot. I did not add butter or vanilla. Read that the butter might separate out and that would make gross coffee creamer. But Definitely tastes really good without the butter. I don't think it really needs vanilla either. Came out to 11.4 ounces(maybe short because of the lack of butter-maybe I cooked it too much-who knows)

The flavour of this was good.  Easiness of the recipe good.  However, I have tried it twice and it only ends up as sweet milk.  It does  not thicken.  The last batch I left in the crock pot for 4 hours.  It would not thicken either time.  I have to use lactose free milk for the kiddos so maybe this affected it?  Not sure.  disappointed as it was a good option for us.
