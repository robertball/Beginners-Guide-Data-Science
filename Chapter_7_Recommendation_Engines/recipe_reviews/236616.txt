I live in Bologna (30 years now!) and have to say that this recipe is pretty darned authentic.  There is more garlic than Tuscans are accustomed to using (that's an american tendency), but if you like it, fine.  Be sure to buy sausage that isn't already full of garlic.  Only other thing....add the red wine to deglaze the skillet after having drained off the fat from the sausage and having put it aside for a moment.  THEN, add the onions, garlic, and squash, and seasonings, and sweat them tender before putting the sausage back into the skillet and adding the broth and spinacini leaves (that's what they're called, here).  Details, but will make for flavors that are more distinct with no added work.  Good recipe!!  Buon appetito!

Rainy day here in CA so home made soup sounded good. This soup was delicious...easy-peasy to make. I did tweak it a bit as I had no red wine; used 3 T. balsamic vinegar instead and it worked fine. Enjoy!

We loved this soup. Mama Mia! Italian flavor AND easy to make.  I added a little diced celery and carrots along with the onion and can't bring myself to use canned chicken broth when it's so easy to make and freeze.. for times like this.. but those were the only changes. This would be great for company with some fresh bread, ripped not sliced for sopping the final drips at the bottom of the bowl.  Great soup on a cold night! Thanks for the recipe DG more offerings like this and you'll be one of my AR favorites!

This was an excellent base soup recipe. I made it with Italian pork sausages and homemade chicken stock. I didn't have an onion so I added celery, green pepper and mushrooms as well as the tomatoes, beans and spinach. I also cooked cheese tortellini and added it to the soup just before serving. We added parmesan. It was delicious!

This soup is so good!  I used sweet sausage and after cooking that I threw it all into my slow cooker except saved the spinach till the last hour. The leftovers were even better the next day. The Pecorino Romano cheese is a must! Definitely a keeper! Thank you

This soup is absolutely delicious!! I mean really, really good! And as a novice cook, I appreciate that it is fairly easy to make. I added celery and carrots to the mix when I sautéed the sausage, onion and garlic and omitted the squash simply b/c I do not like it in soup. I also added some crushed red pepper (approx. ½ tsp or to taste). Yum! I suggest letting the soup simmer longer than 15 minutes – in about 45 – 55 minutes it tasted a whole lot better. Just add the spinach about 15 minutes before finishing as the recipe states. Then break out some good, crusty bread and dive in! The leftovers are just as good if not better. Will make this again and again! THANK YOU very much DomesticGoddess!

This soup was very easy to make and tastes delicious. I followed the recipe and did not make any changes, which is very unusual for me. I got to the end and my mind kept telling me I needed to add more seasoning...but when I tasted the soup it was perfect as is.

I was watching a program on TV.  He was making soup. I felt like making soup and found this recipe. I used all the items and added mushrooms and colored spiral noodles. OMG this hit the spot. This is the ultimate comfort food/soup. The taste was fantastic. Very filling. I had 4 bowl fulls, of course at 3 different sitting on the same day. Piggy piggy but it was so good.

This was excellent! I used ground turkey I had on hand, and added spices to make Turkey Italian Sausage (recipe this site). I followed all other ingredients to a T, but taking Doctor Greg's advice and using the wine to deglaze the pan. Wonderful flavor, everything just melded and came together to make a superior soup that I plan to make again. My husband gives two thumbs up as well! Thanks SO much for the recipe!

This soup is very good!!  I added some carrots and celery  and added a zucchini and a yellow  summer squash . I only had one can of beans but it needs two. Next time I will use more Italian herbs for more flavor.

A delicious soup that is a nice balance of protein and veggies. I added about a quarter cup of quinoa to thicken it up a bit. Fresh grated pecorino on top was a delightful addition.

This turned out REALLY well.  I used a natural chicken sausage already cooked.  Instead of using two cans of white beans, I only used one and added some leftover rice to bulk it up a bit.  The red wine gave it some wonderful depth.  Definitely worth making again.

Out of necessity and choice, we used one can of White Navy beans and One can of  white Cannelini(?) beans,  a broccoli packaged slaw in place of the  squash (which we did not have),
and 1/2 hot chicken sausage, and  1/2 sweet chicken sausage.

Made it tonight, and I thought it was excellent. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and I don't even care for spinach or even onions so much. Other than tossing a little cayenne pepper in for some heat--my preference--I followed it exactly. I served it with garlic bread. My Italian chicken sausage was pre-cooked, so browning was simple.

Love this soup, loved the texture of the white beans and I used Kale instead of spinach and added it last. I also used the slow cooker and Italian sweet and hot sausage for a little kick.

VERY good soup.  I couldn't find chicken Italian sausage at my local market so I used regular hot Italian sausage and it worked great.  Will definitely make again and again!

Husband and I both loved it.  Didn't have yellow squash or spinach so used a small zucchini and kale.  Cooked Italian sausage, put all but kale in crockpot on high for 3 hours, added chopped fresh kale and turned to low for about 1 hour.

I had half a rotisserie chicken and mostly everything but the squash. Used regular Italian sausage, baby kale leaves and added carrots. I had no open bottle of red wine so used 3 to 4 TBS Balsamic vineger and left the squash out. The herbs weighted basil and garlic a little heavier than the Italian mix.  My husband’s serving  had a couple  slices of sourdough bread on the bottom of the bowl and a sprinkle of Parmesan & Romano cheese on top. He raved about it... but he loves my cooking. :)

Loved this recipe!  Went looking for a recipe to use up some leftover cooked Tuscan chicken and stumbled across this easy, quick and healthy dish.  Used 2 links of HEB brand Italian chicken sausage along with the 2 chicken breasts and left everything else the same.  I bet it'll be even better tomorrow!

As with any recipe, I did not follow it word for word, but it was delish! And easy, to boot. It's a keeper. 

(I used 2 zucchini instead of 1 yellow squash, used 48 oz broth, and cut the onion in garlic in half per my family's tastebuds.)

This recipe sounded so good and got such good ratings, but it was really lacking in flavor. The only change I made was that I added extra broth so it made a little more. I would not make it again.

This was fabulous. Didn't have red wine on hand so used 3T of balsamic vinegar and sautéed the onions in that rather than just put it in with the broth. Didn't have squash so omitted and I think maybe it made it even better. I like squash but the flavors/ingredients here were absolutely perfect. Also I increased broth to 48 oz and let it simmer for 30 mins before adding spinach and then simmer for 15 more. Perfection.

I had a really hard time finding Italian chicken sausage, so I bought a plain chicken sausage and made this recipe.  I didn’t have a yellow squash, so I used a zucchini instead, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We liked this, but I have to say, the chicken sausage I used was totally flavorless and I think the soup would have been a lot better had I used sweet or hot Italian sausage.  That, of course, is no fault of the recipe.  So, if I make this again, I’ll use regular Italian sausage, hot would be my preference, or a hot Italian turkey sausage that we like.

I had to substitute zucchini for the yellow squash as none was available. Otherwise made it exactly as written. My husband and I enjoyed it and I will make it again.

One of my absolute favorite soups!  I used hot turkey Italian sausage and kale instead of spinach.  I also used  3 zucchinis instead of summer squash and added carrots -  just because I needed to use it up.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  We love it!!

This was the best soup ever! It came together quickly, & you don't have to wait all day for the flavors to mesh. Follow the advice of Doctor Greg from Bologna on when to add what. I used Italian turkey sausage because I couldn't find chicken. I will definitely be making this often for my family. ??

Easy and amazing! Added mushrooms and carrots, but next time will stick to the original recipe.  Carrots made it somewhat sweet and the mushrooms changed the texture. Delicious nevertheless!

So good!!! Very easy, we added the wine to the pan to deglaze it and also added a bit of extra to the soup. So good might even make it again tonight. (We just had it four days ago) also it tastes amazing the next day the flavors really seem to come out.

This is a HIT! I used homemade chicken broth that I had frozen, and fully-cooked asiago-spinach chicken sausage. So I thawed the broth and tossed in the chopped up sausage while I sautéed the veggies. Wow. Definitely will make again!

I used back-eyed peas instead of the while beans, and they were fine. I like my soups with even a bit more flavor, so added a teaspoon each of "Mural of Flavor" from Penzey's spices and some Garam masala.

Scrumptious and filling!  I used more sausage - about a pound and a quarter.  My whole family loved it, and it's rare that we are all enthusiastic about the same dish.  Highly recommentded.

Wow - fast and easy and full of flavor.  I did make some of the changes suggested by others.  I added yellow bell pepper and carrots.  I used 1 T balsamic vinegar instead of wine and added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.

I liked it a lot. I did make some changes. I used sweet Italian sausage rather than chicken sausage. I used dried beans (which I cooked separately);  I used frozen tomatoes from last years garden rather than canned, and I added some carrots and celery as well. As I said, I totally enjoyed this and will make it again.

It was wonderful even though I couldn't find fresh ground chicken sausage , used the regular large Italian chicken pre made sausage. I didn't have squash but know it will only get better since we love yellow squash. Will definitely make again.  So easy!  Thank you.

This soup is wonderful, but the name is misleading. There is no chicken in the soup. It calls for chicken Italian sausage which I could not find. 

I added a  package of sliced white mushrooms, about half a pound of baby carrots, and let it cook on low for about three hours. I will definitely make this one again!

A definite 5 Star Keeper. Made exactly as written using the lowest salt chicken broth I could find. Since you are using some canned ingredients there is   no need to add additional salt for my taste. Add a little fresh grind pepper to taste.  I did add some rough cut Carmine mushrooms since I love the added flavor . This is a great base soup which can be adapted to your taste. I'm looking forward to using some shredded seasoned chicken next time....store rotisserie would also be great.

This was so flavorful and delicious! I changed it a little. I didn't have red wine, so I used balsamic vinegar. I also doubled the tomatoes, garlic, and spinach. I love zucchini, so I used that instead of summer squash. It was phenomenal! So much better than I expected, and I expected it to be good.

This is easy and delicious. I added shitake mushrooms and will add more spinach next time.
This basic recipe is open to lots of personalization!

This is delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe precisely, though added a little pepper and salt. It will be a wonderful, hearty soup for fall and winter.

Excellent. I did as Doctor Greg advised and added the wine after removing the sausage from the pan. Then I added dried basil, cilantro & oregano, chopped onion, minced garlic, and chopped yellow bell pepper (instead of squash). I also took the advice of other reviewers and added mushrooms and tortellini (toward the end) after letting the soup simmer for an hour, and I used kale instead of spinach.

If you like spinach, add at least a cup more. I doubled the garlic as well. I would make it again.

I pretty much made this as written with only one substitution. I used kale instead of spinach. Enjoyed the soup very much with some crusty French bread! Will make it again.

This is a pretty good base recipe but I prefer more seasonings. I seasoned it fairly lightly with rosemary, thyme and oregano. I also used sweet sausage instead of chicken and kale instead of spinach. It came out really good with those changes and I served it with toasted rustic bread.

This is my first review of a recipe.  Followed directions to a tee except didn't have the recommended cheese so grated some block cheddar and it was fine.  I doubled everything so now my family gets to enjoy it yet again on another evening.  Everyone loved it!

I loved this soup!!!  I did make a few changes I omitted the garlic my pan was still really hot from browning the sausage I was afraid I'd burn the garlic I also used the red wine to deglaze the pan reduced it down by half. I left out the spinach couldn't find baby spinach at the supermarket  I added grated parm cheese to the pot when done cooking cooked it more like 40 mins  and I made pastina on the side small italian pasta that I used as a base for the soup poured it over the pastina. It was fabulous I only wish I had doubled the recipe.

Very easy to throw together. I used hot Italian sausage.   I only had one can of white beans though. I waited until I was ready to serve to add the spinach, let it wilt a little. I forgot to add the red wine, may go back and put it in, but I didn't miss it in my first bowl full! I will keep this recipe.

Ive made this delicious soup for many years. sometimes I make chicken  meatballs in place of chicken sausage and on occasion I'll even add Italian pasta at the end with less beans, zuchinni is great i n it too.
always serve in heated bowls with fresh grater parm cheese aqnd French bread to soak up the juices.
