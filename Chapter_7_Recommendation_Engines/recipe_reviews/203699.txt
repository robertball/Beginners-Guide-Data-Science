Made these for a vegetarian friend without the buns, spread the cheese right onto the mushroom, since we are gluten free. Nothing was missing in fact I think the bun would actually take away from the fantastic flavors. I honestly wasn't sure if I would like these but they are so good. I will be making them again and in fact using the toppings on some steak for my mushroom hating family. I did have to use a small can of sliced beets which I just put into another baking dish along with the mushrooms.

Yummy. I substituted feta for goat cheese, used garlic powder instead of fresh and skipped the spinach. Came out fabulous. Will definitely make again. Oh, and I toasted the buns with the feta on it so that the cheese got melty and clung to the bread. Otherwise, it would have probably crumbled and fallen off.

Literally one of the best things I have ever eaten.  I marinated the mushrooms for a few hours in the balsamic/olive oil and brushed it on during cooking as well.  I also roasted the beets with olive oil smeared on them instead of water.  Insanely delicious!

Mmm-mm-mm!  For faster cooking (and sooner enjoying!) I pressure-cooked the beets, which only took 15 mins.  Used Mediterranean seasoned feta cheese from TJs, which I toasted onto ciabatta buns.  Super yummy and definitely healthy meal (ate with kale chips and sliced persimmons as side dishes).  Bonus: if you cook extra beets you have the makings of a delish spinach-beet-goat-cheese salad the next day!! Thx for the recipe.  (I have a feeling that hubby won't be ordering portobello burgers in restaurants anymore now that these babies are in our repertoire!)

I did not include beets as I used ingredients I had on hand. Otherwise everything else was the same. These were delicious!

This was absolutely scrumptious! I'm a vegetarian and I followed the recipe with the exception of the goat cheese, I substituted vegan mozarella cheese and I used a whole-grain toasted bagel for my bun. I've eaten this two days in a row. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

The balsamic vinegar was too strong. Used onion kaiser buns - great choice. Love goat cheese and portabellas, but would rather eat plain than in this recipe.

Recipe was very yummy! I did almost exactly as listed except used bail instead of rosemary because that is what I had on hand and I toasted my homemade wheat bun. Also added in the basil to mix with the cheese. I'm going to use my left overs to make a salad for lunch tomorrow. I bet it would be even better grilled on a charcoal grill!

I've made these a few times and they're always a hit. Even friends who think they don't like mushrooms are inhaling them. Also, the mix of garlic and balsamic vinegar fill the house with a tantalizing aroma :-)

This is a very clever recipe, I would never have thought to put beets with portobello mushrooms, but size- and flavor-wise it's a great combo. Thanks for sharing!

Full of flavour!  Definitely will make again.  We kept it Gluten Free by using GF buns and used homemade mayo.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a T!  Thank you!

Had this as a stack instead of as burger: used more spinach and less olive oil.  Wilted the spinach with some fresh garlic and topped the mushroom cap, then topped with beet slices and creamy goat cheese and returned to broiler to melt the cheese.  This was fantastic, filling and a relatively low calorie meal.

Very good.  I followed the recipe except to omit the beets and added a splash of red wine to the mushroom basting mixture. We served on brioche buns... the sweetness of which really complimented the recipe. I was worried about the balsamic overpowering, but it really didn't. Next time I will marinate the mushrooms instead of just basting them.

Very creative and nutritious as well. I used Feta cheese. It was a filing sandwich and for the most part well received by my family.
