I look at the reviews before I decide to try it. There have been 3 on this one. First One didn't use tuna rated it a 4. Another changed almost the whole recipe and rated it 3. The 3rd said it didn't amount to enought to fill the dish and rated it a 1. Was it still a good recipe or are you giving it a 1 because it didn't fill the dish? The other two. Did you do this recipe before changing the ingrediance, Or did you make the changes on the first attempt? Rating's aren't judged after changing ingrediances. As for not filling the dish. Make sure of your sizes and amounts.

I made lots of adjustments to this, and I liked it, but I still think it lacks seasoning - pepper at the very least - maybe garlic and paprika would have helped too.  I used green onions, no olive oil, fat free soup, rice instead of cereal and canned salmon instead of tuna.  Next time I also want to add a vegetable like peas.

9x13 is way too big for the amount of ingredients.

Bravo Doug! Great dish for the busy family. I have cooked this twice one time substituting Rice Crispys for the wheat Flakes. Hmm Good. I also like the idea of spicing it up with cashews instead of the peanuts and a touch of ranch dressing. Does not feed the whole family though, I actually cooked it in the tuna can.

Well... I think this recipe is VERY interesting and quite tasty.  As for the amounts used.. I measured carefully and ended up with enough ingredients to fill an 8x8" casserole, which was the best size for my husband and I.  If I had used the 9x13...my casserole would have been about an inch thick... 
I don't know if I will make it again... but it was quick and something that kids would enjoy.

Wow, hats off to Nana!!  I made this tonight and had to restrain myself from having a third helping. It's sooo good. Only change in the recipe was that I had no flake cereal so I used leftover Chex mix (with chocolate, if you can believe that).  Anyway, it's tasty, filling, does not taste like tuna but maybe chicken.  Great for a fall or winter evening. Love the peanut crunchy top but cashews could work, definitely.  Very satisfying.

I used canned salmon and noodles instead of cereal and added a bit of milk and it was a hit!
