This was truly AMAZING!!! I doubled the bacon and corn relish, added some diced jalapeno in place of the cayenne.  It was raining, so I didn't fire up the grill, instead I used the good ole cast iron skillet. I slightly wilted the spinach also. GREAT recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous.  To save the fat, I didn't cook the vegetables in the bacon grease.  I oven baked my bacon, patted it dry with paper towels and then diced/crumbled it.  I then put the bacon in a saute pan with the veggies and a TINY bit of olive oil.  I added the cayenne pepper to taste and I bet I ended up with more like 1/4 tsp. of cayenne (and it was not too spicy).  Corn is not yet in season, so I used one can of shoepeg white corn (niblets) and the ratio to the rest of the relish was perfect.  We grilled a 2-1/2 pound filet of salmon and this was just enough relish for that size.  For a larger piece of salmon, I would have to double the relish.  Everyone loved it!

This is a game changer for salmon!  So amazing!!  The only thing I did was drain some of the bacon grease before adding the vegetables.  Otherwise this recipe is perfect!

My husband is not a big salmon fan, but he really liked this dish.   The corn relish is delicious.  I did not have access to a grill, so I cooked the fish in the oven.   Here is how I did that:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.   Melt about 3 Tablespoons of butter in a glass baking dish in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes. Season the flesh side of fish with dried basil. Place the fish skin-side up in the hot butter and bake for about 4-5 minutes.  Remove from oven and peel off the skin.   (If it does not easily pull off, it is not ready - put back in oven for a couple of minutes.).  After peeling off the skin, season that "skin side" with salt and pepper.  Turn fish over and season the herbed side with salt and pepper.  Return to oven for 4-5 minutes or until slightly underdone.  (The fish should flake easily with a fork, but slightly opaque.  It will continue to cook after removing from oven. ).   It was so yummy!

Aaaaaaaahmazing! My husband barely came up for air while eating this dish. Didn't have rice vinegar on hand so I substituted apple cider vinegar. Still yummy!

Did the bacon first, drained most of the fat, then sautéed the onion and zucchini  (3 of them sliced) to replace the peppers and spinach, added a cup of frozen corn kernels, 1 teaspoon of garlic and 1 chopped jalopeno. Added 1 tblsp cajun spice, served all of that on top of the salmon. The family loved it

This is an easy 5 star recipe.  The corn relish makes an excellent side dish if you have any left over.

Words from my husband: "Phenomenal!".  Don't mess with this recipe. It is fantastic!  My son is working in Alaska and sending home salmon and halibut by the boxful. I had a filet of halibut leftover from the day before, so i used this on King Salmon and Halibut. BOTH were delicious! This corn and bacon salsa is fantastic, even as a side dish.

Delicious!  I agree to drain the bacon fat before sautéing the vegetables. I also added some fresh diced red peppers and tomatoes to the bed of spinach.  Toasted French bread and a Virginia Merlot complimented the dish.

Rated 5 stars due to taste, presentation, and ease of preparation.  The ease in preparation was astonishing and everything just flowed together for an easy fix delicious meal that would impress anyone. I tweaked it a bit and will remove the bacon grease the next time I make it.....well, most of it anyway. I can make the statement that the best salmon I have ever eaten was in Texas, tonight.

This is absolutely delicious!!!! I did drain most of the grease after I fried the bacon.  I also cooked the salmon about 8 minutes total.  I like my salmon medium rare.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will increase the green peppers to 1/2 cup.

This is great! I made a couple of small changes tho. I cooked and drained the bacon, adding back about 1 teaspoon of the grease. Without husking the corn, I grilled it over high heat, just until the husks started to burn and the corn was hot. After it was cool enough to handle, I cut it off the cob and continued the relish recipe as written. Also we don't like our salmon quite as well done, so we only cooked it about 6 minutes total with the skin side down, then peeled off skin before serving. YUMMY!

This was super good.  I cooked it on the grill using a cedar plank.  I made a big batch of the fried corn with bacon and it was amazingly good.

Forget as a topper, I could eat this as a side! It went so well with salmon, light, fresh, slightly spicy, and colorful, even the kids loved it! It felt like dining at a 5 star restaurant. Can't wait to show this off next time we have company.

I have tried many of Chef John's recipes and have absolutely LOVED them!  This salmon dish was no different. I made this for my sweetheart and we enjoyed it tremendously. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems...well the only problem was that I wish I had more of the relish afterwards.

We absolutely loved this recipe. Salmon is not a typical meal in our household generally due to lack of good recipes and very little experience with preparing it. This one is a keeper and will go into regular use.

Delicious.  Used olive oil instead of bacon grease to cook vegetables.  Made it twice in one week.  Put fresh spinach on salmon first time, and added spinach last minute of cooking corn the second time.  Both were good.

The  bacon and corn relish is something I would have never thought to put on salmon. When I watched the video, I HAD to make it that day (2 days ago). I made my salmon in the pan because I don't have a grill. It still turned out yummy and cooked just right. 
The relish was so easy to make, and it tasted amazing. Everyone loved it. Served it with sauteed asparagus and grilled okinawan sweet potatoes.

This was great! I had never cooked any kind of fish steak before, but this was easy AND delicious! I'll definitely be making this again. But I won't be cutting corn off the cob the way he demonstrates in the video again. I did cut a finger a little bit. Learn from me! If it feels unsafe, it probably is!
Great recipe though.

Followed the instructions except left out the pepper and vinegar which are taste killers for us.  This was an excellent way to eat Salmon.  The corn was too good, I plan on using this as a side to other meals.

Loved this recipe! I’m not a fan of onions, so I removed them from the recipe, but included the spinach in the corn mixture. I sautéed the spinach with the corn, bacon, and red pepper. Definitely will be making again. :)

Truly awesome recipe!  Couldn’t grill outside due to weather.  Grilled the salmon on a  stovetop grill pan.  Followed the recipe as stated but substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon.  Delicious!

Followed the directions to the letter.  This was just ok.  It seems to me the bacon overpowered all of flavor of the fish. It was also a very oily dish.  Salmon has enough oil on its own, but the bacon, the olive oil and the vegetable oil on the fish made me cleanse my palate immediately after eating. I usually like most of Chef John's  recipes, but this one missed the mark for me and my family.

This recipe is fantastic. Only thing that I had to change was 5 slices of bacon instead of 6. Only had 5. But it was not missed. I did have some of the relish left. i could eat it by itself. Thank you.

This is amazing. Great way to introduce salmon to finicky eaters. I did not have rice vinegar, so I substitute red wine vinegar worked out great. Love chef Johns videos...makes cooking less intimating.

I really don't care for fish much at all and normally when we make it we drown it in mayo or cheese.  This is such a light, summer feeling recipe!  Loved it.  Made it as listed but drained the bacon grease like others.  This was so good!

I don't normally like any type of fish - especially salmon. But this was really good and hubby (who loves fish - especially salmon) raved about how great this was. Definitely added to recipe rotation file. Oh and didn't change a thing wonderful as is.

really liked this as a new alternative for salmon dishes we make.  Like someone else, I drained off the bacon grease before adding the veggies. Liked the sweet/salty combo of the bacon and corn and the relish worked well with the salmon.  definitely going to use again

Very, very good! I used pre-cooked bacon that I had on hand, but next time I'll get fresh. We decided to lightly wilt the spinach with a little garlic and olive oil. Also, I started to use frozen corn but decided not to take that shortcut and bought fresh ears. I carefully followed the advice to cook the corn just long enough to warm it through. It stayed nice and crunchy. Even my 14 yo son liked it. I highly recommend this recipe.

The relish was tasty and usable on a variety of proteins, or even as a nice side. Unfortunately I made it to try to improve the low quality discount salmon, which didn't happen. Even though I used lemon and the relish strategy, none of my efforts or this tasty relish over rode the disgusting taste of the poor quality salmon.   Lesson learned! 

The only reason I gave it a 4 star was that I wasn't able to fully evaluate it when coupled with quality salmon.

I'm not a fan of salmon, but trying to get more fish into my diet. This was fantastic! First time I have ever finished a whole portion of salmon. I had some fresh basil so added that to the corn relish. So good. Well done, Chef John!

I was so excited to make his but a tad disappointed after I tasted it.  I loved all the ingredients that were in the recipe but I felt it lacked the complex flavors that I was expecting.   I plan to make this again but I'm thinking about adding a taco style seasoning to the relish and adding cilantro to the relish as well.  My family absolutely loved it the way it was but I'd like to experiment with a few variations.

Fabulous and so easy! Cut the bacon down to 2 slices, and that was perfect. Tried this again on another date using chicken breasts and that was equally nummy!! This one goes into our "make this regularly" files, especially when corn is at peak season.

I made the bacon cor relish and it was great.  Ocean salmon was very expensive this week and I can not use farmed at all.  So we got a cod fish and it was great due to the the cod do not have much taste.  We will use it again hopefully on salmon.

I have never been a great fan of onions. (grew up on a farm where one of the crops was 6000 onions)but I am now 62 and learning to cope. The only suggestion I would give is to solve the white versus yellow corn dilemma is to use bi-color corn. It has the sweetness of white and the flavor of yellow. Just another choice from an old farm boy.

I've made to several times now and look forward to this corn bacon relish topping. Make the corn bacon relish ahead of time and just warm it up a little while the salmon cooks. This is great for a  special company dinner and make sure to use a generous amount of baby spinach. This recipe has a great presentation and pairs well with a cold coleslaw or even a pasta side.

I'm only going to rate this because the relish for this dish is totally awesome!! I don't like fishy fish but someone gave us some salmon so I tried this recipe. It was to fishy for me but I'm going to try the relish with a less fishy fish.

Made this tonight and it was fabulous.  I only added about a tablespoon of sugar to the relish just before turning it off.  Otherwise, made exactly as per recipe and served with herbed rice.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

Have only made the corn relish as a side. Pretty much make as recipe states but since we are in the midst of corn season I have been freezing extra corn for this recipe. I usually double the recipe because it is even better the next day.

My husband loved it. It thought it was good as it was a nice change from a dijon mustard prep for salmon. A tad oily on the relish - not sure why the olive oil is needed when all the bacon grease is in there.

Really delicious and easy to make.  Like other reviewers I  slightly modified by not cooking the relish in the bacon grease and was very happy with the results.  Super summery meal!

We all thought the relish was sensational but it didn't do much for the flavor of the salmon.  I will continue to make the relish - my husband thought it was wonderful!

One of the best Salmon recipes I've made. It is now my "signature" dish. Drain bacon grease thoroughly. Use frozen corn if you don't have con on the cob. You can also bake the salmon instead of grilling it.

Beautiful, easy, and sooooo Yummy!  I planned to make this recipe exactly as written but indoors.  I know I had a bell pepper. Where did it go? Okay I'll use this sweet banana pepper.  Oh no, it's a hot banana pepper.  Okay, no cayenne then.  I knew I didn't have any rice wine vinegar but distilled white vinegar did just fine.  It tasted great right there but I missed the red color from the bell pepper I didn't have.  So I threw in come cherry tomatoes.  It was fabulous.  I put the relish on the spinach while I cooked the salmon.  No need to dirty two pans. And no additional vegetable oil needed. By the time I had coked the salmon the spinach had wilted just the perfect amount.  I will make this dish again and again.  This is on my 'go to' list for family or for company.

What a delightful dinner! I made this yesterday and I absolutely LOVED it! This is definitely on my list of favorite things to make and I'll be using this recipe as a guideline... Might add jalapeños next time! ;-P the only thing I did differently was just draining most of the grease before adding the veggies.

You absolutely must try this recipe!  I highly recommend adding the spinach; it balances the recipe and heat from the cayenne.  I didn't have fresh corn, but it was still awesome! - Jill

This recipe was a good as any meal I have  ever eaten out. I added a little brown sugar and paprika to the salmon with the salt and pepper. I did not put cayenne on the salmon though, but did put a diced jalepeno in the relish. I made a coconut lime rice and grilled asparagus for the sides.  It all worked together and was fantastic. I can't wait to make it for company!

Really great recipe and incredibly easy. I will drain the fat (didn't this time as the recipe didn't suggest) next time. My husband loved the relish so much he went back 3 times! Obviously I didn't put enough on his salmon. Served withe a sudden of couscous and it was a beautiful meal..

Decided to cook up something for my wife and myself since the kids were out.  It was awesome that flavors all came together making it a wonderful dish.  My wife is not much for spice so I only used 1/8 of a teaspoon of cayenne in the relish and then sprinkled a little extra on my piece of fish.

Delicious and very easy.  Made for a great dinner.  I served it on a
bed of long grain rice.  Complete meal.
