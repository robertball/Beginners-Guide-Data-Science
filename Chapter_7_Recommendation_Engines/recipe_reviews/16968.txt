pretty good. everyone ate it and gave it a 5. I like a good bit of jalapeno in it as well as diced green onion. also used white cheese instead of american.

I stumbled across this recipe when looking for a kid's appetizer -- I make a few changes & call it Cowboy Hash. Brown 1lb. lean ground beef & drain off any excess fat. Stir in some chopped onion & heat thru a couple minutes more. Transfer the mixture to your crockpot & be certain to use the Rotell tomatoes brand. I don't put in the broccoli. Excellent for Super Bowl parties New Year's Eve etc.

I make this recipe without the broccoli and it is also very good. For guest who do not like spicy try the non-spicy pork. For those who want extra spicy use Mexican processed cheese.

Made this for the Superbowl and it was the most popular dip served. I forgot to get frozen chopped broccoli but will use it next time just to see how the flavor changes.

I've made this before and it's always hit. This time however I mixed a pound of sweet italian ground sausage. It's amazing.

Im sorry to be the lone negative force here but this was awful. I was really looking forward to having broccoli in a spicy cheese dip (a family favorite) but this was bland and had no flavor. it was also soupy with big chunks. Maybe salting a peppering the broccoli before adding and adding some jalapoenos and green chilis would help but honestly i threw it away. Thankfully I was having an appitizer party so had a lot of other things to serve. thanks tho.

I browned the sausage and then threw everything in a slow cooker because I was busy making other things. I actually think this turned out good. I don't think it can be considered a Mexican cheese dip but it was still good.
