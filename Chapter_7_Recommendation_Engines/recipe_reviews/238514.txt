I was pleasantly surprised to find this not bad at all. I was feeling adventurous, so I went for it but I thought it would't taste as good, it seems to be lacking in sugar. But it was good and my kids ate it. Usually we use a recipe w gluten free cake mix and it turns out nice and sweet. But this one I admit is waaaaay healthier so I will definitely keep this in my collection!

Easy to make, and has great taste!  Maybe next time, I'll add some crunch by adding chopped pecans or sunflower seeds, but just as written, this is a wonderful recipe!

It's quite good for gluten/dairy-free...the consistency is a little squishy.  Maybe I shouldn't take away a star for its gluten-free-ness (but I did)!

Excellent! Moist. Great flavor. No after taste which can be the case with gluten-free food. I did make some changes because I am nut, egg, dairy and soy allergic. Replaced soy flour with coconut flour and the egg with a flax ‘egg’ and used coconut milk in place of almond milk. Have 2 more very ripe bananas. Going to make another for church tomorrow.

First I'll make note I am new to gluten free baking. That said, this recipe was very easy. this turned out very tasty  but was more  of a cake consistency rather than a bread consistency, which was fine with me. I thought the sweetness was perfect , however if you like a sweeter bread you might want to add more sugar. I followed the directions as written, however, I did not have baking soda on hand so I increased the baking powder to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons. I also used Bob's Red Mill baking flour mix instead of the flour combinations and added about half a cup of unsweetened coconut. I sprinkled 1/3 cup walnuts and almonds chopped on top. I baked in an 8x8 square pan as recommended.  I will make this again. Thank you
