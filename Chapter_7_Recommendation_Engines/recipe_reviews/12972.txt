I used bacon grease and added green peppers and a shallot w/extra garlic when veggies were almost soft.  I removed most of veggies to brown meat and drained grease, then added veggies back to meat and added 1 can of potatoes(diced small) and 1 can of corn and chili seasonings w/ a little worcestershire sauce w/ the rest of the ingredients.  I used a lot less water just added till consistency suited me.  Delicious!!!!!!!

I was looking for a recipe like this... hate beans, but love the flavor of chili.  I added some extras (chili powder, cumin, cayenne, bay leaf, brown sugar) and it made a wonderful base.  My boyfriend said that something was lacking though... apparently potatoes aren't enough to make up for beans.

Yummy and low-cal!!  It's convenient when you don't have a can or two of the right beans!

I think this recipe is good.  I made it for 10 of my bean eating friends and they said they liked it they thought it was unique.  I liked it, thought it was yummy.  I am not much of a bean eater.

I'm wishing the author would've been a bit more specific....like, should we drain the tomatos?  Do we cook it covered or uncovered?  I didn't drain the tomatos, and brought it to a boil, then turned down the heat and let it simmer uncovered.  I also ended up adding quite a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.  It wasn't bad...it just needs something and I can't figure out what that is!  I added more onion, beef boullion, and salt, but it still tasted kind of bland.  My husband added chili powder and he liked it that way.

I tweaked this by serving over baked potatoes as I was short on time. Was a great dish for a cold evening.

I added 1 tube of pork sausage to this recipe and used only 5 potatoes. It really needs less water & more spices....I added chili powder & extra hot sauce. It came out much more like a soup.

I took the advice of other reviews and added spices to the chili, as well as some salsa.  Without it, it would have been too bland for my taste. Additionally, I topped off the bowl before serving with shredded cheddar, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips- that really added flavor and texture to the chili.
