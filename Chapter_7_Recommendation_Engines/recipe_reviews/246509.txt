The quickest dessert I've ever made ! And it is so yummy.
I happen to usually have puff pastry in my freezer and couple of kinds of jam in the fridge. So this is going to be my go to recipe when ever a last minute dessert is needed..
I have made this dessert few times already, using peaches, plums and lately blackberries. The 1st couple of time making it, the jam leaked an made the pastry little bit soggy. Then I reduced the amount of jam, underneath the fruit, using less than half a teaspoon,  and that was perfect. The tartelettes were crispy and had plenty of taste and shine from the jam.

Lovely!! I used a bit too much jam and it spread all over the pastry. So, I advise following the amounts written to make sure they have that border. Otherwise, you'll need a knife and fork to eat them. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy and a lovely presentation. Per some comments, I used very scant apricot jam on each tartlet. And horrors, just before making I discovered someone ate my fresh peaches! I used canned peaches (in 100%juice) and drained them very very well. Sliced them thin and proceeded with recipe. Had to add a couple mins of baking time. Turned out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Family enjoyed it. Thinking I have to learn the balance of jam vs the delicious juice dripping from the baked peaches so that the phyllo remains crisp and flaky. I usually don't bake pastry items so overall I was pleasantly surprised.
