I enjoyed this dish !  The only thing I did differently was to not cook the chicken completely in the microwave.  I put the chicken, rice and soup into the oven for about 20 minutes until fully cooked.  I also tossed the bread in a little olive oil so they would crisp up nicely.  I loved the simplicity of this as well.

I enjoyed this recipe, although I added a few things. I substituted 1 cup mozzerella cheese for 1 cup cheddar. I also added 1/2 cup sour cream for a little zing.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I made some major changes. I didn't have a lot of time and went with what I had available in the house at the moment, so I substituted the cream of chicken soup for cream of broccoli. I did cook the chicken in the microwave in about a quarter of the soup. I found that this  made chicken less dry and more flavourful.
I also omitted the breadcrumbs, just for personal preference. I'm not a fan of breadtopped casseroles. Good and easy recipe for me to make relatively quickly and with very little planning in advance, which is hard to do with an infant.
I will be making this recipe again and like the simplicity, as it adds room for substitutions.

This was a nice, easy recipe.  It went over with my boyfriend, who is very picky.  I actually mixed mozzarella cheese and cheddar, and I thought the combination turned out well.  I microwaved the chicken in a bowl with a little water and adobo powder, I thought that gave it a little more flavor. I enjoyed this recipe!

Add a 1/4 cup - 1/2 cup of cream cheese with the mushroom soup!!  Livens it up a bit.

Basic casserole for that would be good for a busy night.  Good, but kind of boring.

This is a family favorite at our house.  I use regular cream of mushroom soup not reduced fat and I don't put bread chunks on top - just the cheese.  I usually use the casserole mix shredded cheese but it's great with cheddar-jack or just cheddar.  I don't use reduced fat cheese either.
