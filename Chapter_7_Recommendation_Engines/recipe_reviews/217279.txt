Sounds like my favorite "comfort food" from my childhood. The only difference was that my mom cooked and broke up about 1 lb. of ground beef before following the rest of the recipe-- I can't wait to try it!

This isn't so much soup as just lots of tomato with some pasta & meatballs. We're not big tomato lovers so I don't think we'll try it again.

This is SO good. The only changes I made were using home canned tomatoes (canned without salt) so I had to add a little extra salt and I didn't have any "Italian seasoning" blend so I used Basil Oregano and Thyme. I was a little worried it would be excessive on the seasonings but it's just right. Oh and I cut back on the meatballs a bit. I added 18 instead of 25. It's not lacking. I'm tempted to add white and kidney beans and some corn and maybe some sun dried tomatoes next time.

To be fair I took the advice of other reviewers and added more flavor. Instead of plain water I used broth. I also used fresh basil and an extra clove of garlic. It was quite enjoyable!

This was simple and a fairly quick supper to put together. I had to make a few substitutions but I don't think they made a difference with flavor. I only had a red bell pepper instead of green and I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I added a can of green beans for color and more flavor. I also mixed parmesan cheese into the soup. I think adding kidney beans and corn as another reviewer suggested would be good. As written it just wasn't flavorful enough for us but I was able to adjust it to fit our tastes.

Oh look it's Thursday! Spaghetti and meatball night! Except it's already 4:30 I don't have sauce started and no meatballs made. So I tried this and it was great! I didn't put peppers in (kids don't like didn't have anyway) deglazed the onions and garlic with a bit of red wine before adding everything else and used chicken/turkey broth. Everyone liked with crusty bread and butter will make again! I was fooled by the "4 servings" and used way too small of a pot. Use at 6 litre dutch oven! Also this is way more than 4 servings! So good thing we liked it ha ha. Edit: This freezes well without the pepper I made a batch and froze in lunch-sized servings.:)

This is really good!  Especially if you like tomatoe based soups!  Seriously.  A lot of tomatoe goes into this.  If your family does not like tomatoes then why even try it?    So very filling!
