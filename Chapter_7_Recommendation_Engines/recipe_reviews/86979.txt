This is a delicious recipe! I was a little worried about the rhubarb being fully cooked so I went a head & poached it in boiling water for 10 minutes to make sure it was soft. (I had a pie not turn out so great before when I didn't know about poaching rhubarb.)
This cake is beautiful! Some of the topping stuck to the bottom of the pan when I flipped it over but it came off easy & I just spread it right back on top of the cake. I also garnished the cake with pineapple rings since this is for Nana's 85th birthday. Thanks for the great recipe! A Keeper!

I tried the white cake mix and did not care much for it so next time I made the cake with yellow cake mix. It turned out great. You will have to try it yourself and see what you think. All and all, great recipe.

Absoltuely delicious.  Make sure you chop the rhubarb so that it is cooks while the cake bakes.  1hour is too long, it was done in 45 minutes.

My whole family loved this - even better than traditional pineapple upside-down cake. I used what rhubarb we had, which ended up being about 2 cups instead of 3, and found that 1 hour at 350 was a little much. Next time I'll try 1 hour at 325 or 50 minutes at 350.

This is very good.  I used a yellow cake mix as suggested by another reviewer and it turned out great!  Everyone enjoyed it.  Very flavorful.  Great recipe for rhubarb! The pineapple adds an extra nice touch!

De-lish!  My brother-in-law loves this recipe.  Didn't use as much rhubarb and used a bigger box of gelatin b/c it's all I had.  Good stuff!

Didn't have Rhubarb and will certainly try later with it, but still tasted great just using pineapple.

Very simple delicious recipe.  I didn't have crushed pineapple and substituted a can of fruit cocktail instead.  Still turned out great.  Even those who "think" they don't like rhubarb will love it!

Turned out great even with substitutions, so get creative! After deciding to make this recipe, I discovered I didn't really have all the ingredients. I used one large box of sugar-free cherry gelatin and cut both of the sugars down to 1/4 cup (as suggested by other reviewers). Instead of the pineapple, I used a 15-oz can of dark sweet pitted cherries-undrained-that I chopped in a food processor. I also opted to use a lemon cake mix. I left the cake in the pan and had to wait until it cooled completely for the bottom to gel.  I didn't have any problems removing pieces from the pan, flipping upside down, and adding a dollop of cool whip. The end result was a nice, light and fruity, spring/summer dessert--almost strawberry shortcake-ish.

I used yellow cake mix and cherry gelatin (since I didn't have strawberry gelatin). It was still very good. I cut down some on the sugar and could use some more cutting down. Turning the cake upside down was messy. Using a spoon to dish it out of the original pan would be an easier and less messy option.

I made this cake for our family Labor Day celebration last week-end and every one loved it.  I only baked mine for 45 mins. and that was purfect.  Cooled it for 5  minutes before turning the cake over and everything still stuck to the pan.  But not a problem, I just scooped it all off and smeared it over the top.  The next day I had a leftover slice and added a small scoop of Cool Whip on top - and I think I would do that from now on - much better.  Excellent recipe - thanks for sharring it.

WOW!  This is the absolute best pineapple upside down cake recipe I have ever made.  It was a huge hit with the whole family.  Extremely moist, because of the marshmallows. I chopped the rhubarb very small and it cooked just fine without pre-cooking it.

I make a version of this cake. I did not use pinapple. I just did everything but the pinapple. YUMMY! Just a note it takes a really long time to cook all the way through though. I also use all white sugar, no brown. YUM Also to note. I just layered everything. I first put down the rhubarb, then sprinkle white sugar over the top (only use 3/4 cup) and then sprinke the jello powder over the rhubarb. Next I sprinkle the marshmallows and then poor the cake batter over the top of it. Turns out perfect and is absolutely delicious!

absolutely delicious!  Very simple to make.  Mine was done in 50 minutes.  Thanks for sharing.  Now I can add another rhubarb recipe to my growing collection.  I am currently trying to get rhubarb to grow at my house.  I think I will be able to "harvest" it next year finally.

This recipe was a huge hit - especially with fresh whipped cream!  I used yellow butter cake instead of white and only baked it for 45 minutes, which was plenty (even at high altitude) for a 13x9 pan.  I used uncooked rhubarb cut into 1/2 - 1/4" slices and didn't have any problems with it being undercooked.

What a great recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing.  I went with the other reviewers and used 1/4 cup for both the sugar and brown sugar and it was perfect.  Used sugar free jello.  I checked two stores and couldn't find strawberry so used raspberry the first time and lemon the second and both were very good.  Left out the marshmellows because we don't need the extra calories! I used a sugar free yellow cake the first time and a Betty Crocker Gluten Free yellow cake the second time. Also agree that 45 minutes is perfect for baking.

I originally was looking for pineapple upside down cake but came across this one and realized I had rhubarb in the fridge, so I thought I would try it.  I used Golden Butter cake mix. I only had about 2 cups of rhubarb, but I substituted with pineapple.  I served it with Cool Whip and everyone loved it.  Even my husband who was originally skeptic of the rhubarb.  I am going to make this for our next family get together. 

Note:  You do not have to precook the rhubarb as long as you cut it up small enough (I cut the stalks in half then dice them) it cooks perfectly.

This was too sweet for my taste. When i bake with rhubarb I am looking for a bit of tartness so if I make this again I will decrease the sugar.  I had fun playing "cake mix DR". Well received and something different.

Growing up my mother always made "rhubarb upside down cake".  She did not use the pineapple juice, but it makes a lovely addition. I was happy to find this recipe as I seem to have misplaced my copy of my mothers. We have always used yellow cake mix as well.  It really does come out of the pan better if you let it completely cool before flipping.

This cake was a big hit! Everyone loved it!  Before I put the jello and crushed in the bottom of the pan I put pineapple rings in,  I cut the rhubarb in small pieces to ensure they cooked through, or you can use frozen and thawed rhubarb, it works too.  I skipped the marshmallows, it would have been way too sweet.

For those having problems getting the cake out of the pan: Before baking, line the pan with waxed paper. Makes flipping it out easier and then you just peel off the waxed paper. Perfect cake. :)

This was delicious. I used the yellow cake mix and the bigger box of jello. (sugar free) I also will bake it next time for only 45mn.It was a little dry after an hr. Great recipe!
