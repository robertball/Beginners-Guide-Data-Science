Yummy glaze that forms a delicious crust if you baste the ham every 20 minutes. Put a nice thick layer on each time. You need 1" of liquid on the bottom of the pan. I had a large roasting pan that required 2 cups of water to which I added  the juice from a can of pineapple rings. OJ would be good too. It's important to re-tent the ham tightly after you baste each time so that the ham steams and remains juicy. I took the foil off the last 30 minutes, basted with the remaining sauce and then put pineapple rings with maraschino cherries on toothpicks all over the ham. Then I got out my basting bulb and used the pan liquid every 15 minutes till it was done. I had a 9.5 lb spiral cut smoked ham. Next time I'll increase the amount of glaze. Maybe even double it since the crust is an excellent flavor. Everyone loved it and asked to take some home.  The contrast of the caramelized crust and glazed pineapple made a beautiful presentation. Served it with Spinach, cranberry & almond salad; loaded baked potatoes, steamed broccoli with lemon zest. You can tell something is good when no one talks! I just heard "Mmmm...." while they ate. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

This was so delicious!!!  I didn't have any whole cloves, so I added about 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves to the mixture and it worked fine.  Also, I didn't have a rack to put it on, so I lined my pan with tin foil and added about 1/2 cup of water to the pan.  Clean up was a breeze, and the ham was absolutely delicious!!  Made it for Easter, and my guests couldn't stop eating it!  I had to send the home with a doggy bag!! Thanks Chef John!!!

We made this recipe for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit!  The ham I purchased was a spiral so we didn't have to score ham.  Chef John is right throw that packet away that come with the ham because his sauce much better.  I didn't have rice vinegar on hand so substituted balsamic vinegar & left out the worcheshire sauce.  This is my one and only ham recipe from now on.

I tried this for Easter. It was really incredible on just a regular but ham. It was incredible. Juicy, favor filled and with a nice crust. I feel guilty that it was so delicious, and I ate too much. The favors melded so nicely. I just turned the broiler on to bubble the crust when it was fully cooked.  Just used ground cloves and anise in the glaze, because that is all I had on hand. Would use this in the future for sure!

Thank you Chef John! I made this with a half picnic fully cooked ham.  I  followed Chef John's recipe exactly, except for the star anise, which I didn't have.  My ham was 5.34 pounds and it took 1 1/2 hours.  Didn't have a blow torch, so turned my oven to low broil to caramelize the glaze.  It was fantastic!  Turned out moist and the glaze was to die for! I will never do ham any other way!

I admit it.  I was skeptical about the rice vinegar and cayenne pepper, but I followed the recipe (actually doubled it for the size ham).  The only think I omitted was the star of anise (don't like it).   I made this for my family at Christmas and it is the VERY BEST HAM I'VE EVER MADE!!!!  Everyone was asking how I got that crust on there or what did you put on there.  I did not have to brulee the sugar.  It  crusted up just by being in the oven.  It was so delicious!  Thank you Chef for sharing this recipe.

Perfect blend of ingredients for the glaze -- sweet, but not too sweet, tangy, and with a little kick (not too spicy)! It's nice to have a different recipe for ham when you don't want a sweet glaze for ham. I used a 10 LB spiral ham and followed the steps exactly. The only change I made was using about 1.5 tsp anise seed because I could not find whole star anise. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John! It's so good we can't stop nibbling on the left overs -- and we're a 2 person household! ;)

This is the very BEST glaze I have ever used on a ham, and I am dead serious when I say that this ham turned out better than any other I have ever made. My company could not stop saying how delicious the ham was, and they all wanted the glaze recipe. It was super easy to make, and it gave the ham a delicious carmel-ly  crispy texture. Chef John knocked it out of the ballpark once again!

I raise my own hogs and have my butcher smoke my hams for me. I used an 8 lb. bone in smoked ham, fully cooked.  I usually follow new recipes exactly at least once before messing with them, but it's New Years Eve and I didn't have the exact ingredients for the glaze, so I winged it with what was available in my pantry.  I had no star anise, I used ground cloves (about 1/2-1 tsp.), dry ground mustard (didn't have any dijon), doubled the amount of vinegar (to taste), and I added about 2 tsp.of fresh grated orange zest. The glaze was so delicious I could drink it!  The ham came out super moist and tender and everyone loved it!
I will definitely use this recipe again.

My ham was a small  prescliced one, the sclices came apart as it cooked and the feathered edges burnt while the core was still undone

It's the day before Thanksgiving, went to Honey Baked Ham store only to be met with a block and a half long line (no way I was going to wait!). Figured I'd make my own, cooked it tonight before Thanksgiving. WOW! I think I'm done with Honey Baked Ham. Accidentally added more than a pinch of cayenne pepper, but the extra bite is completely yummy. Love ham and this is probably the best ever!

I've tried a lot of honey baked ham wanna be recipes without success.  This one works! I followed the directions as written. Best ham I've ever made, the family agrees.  This is my one and only ham recipe.  Thanks for another winning recipe, Chef John!

I made this exactly as written and it came out terrific!  Lots of 
compliments on this ham.   I even purchased a "plain ole ham"
that I had never bought before and was a little worried about
that but it was great!  Love Chef John recipes!

Best ham I've ever had! I didn't have whole anise or whole clove, so I used anise seed and ground clove instead. I made this for a dinner party last night, and got rave reviews! Amazing! Thanks Chef!

This is THE ham recipe I've been looking for my entire life ! Everyone went crazy for it, and my sons family came back over later that evening to have more because they couldn't quit thinking about it. The  ham was so juicy, and the glaze was crackly on the outside, it was so delicious and was the best ham I've ever had, it was  so full of flavor ! I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar like some said, and I left out the anise because I didn't have it,  I did put the whole cloves in the bottom of the pan, and I think that was a genius idea, it added so much flavor. I will never cook ham any other way, thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I waited too long to buy a ham for Easter so I just got one of the whole boneless hams as no one had country style in stock. Followed the recipe precisely except for 2 things others have mentioned. I used pineapple juice instead of water and instead of rice vinegar I used apple cider vinegar. We had 16 people over for the holiday and EVERY person complimented me on the flavor and glaze of the ham. Thank you Chef John!

Loved the recipe. This is now my go to recipe for hams. The only change I made was to use pineapple juice instead of water. (You could also use orange juice)  I did keep the ham covered with aluminum foil until the last 30 minutes to keep it moist.

This was awesome.  I substituted apple cider for rice cider and used 3/4 cup of orange juice for the anise.  Thank you Madeline for the suggestion.  This was so good and I may make it my regular recipe for baked ham.  If you haven't tried this you need to.  You will get hooked on the flavor.

Terrific recipe for baked ham! I followed Chef John's recipe exactly, basted religiously but no torch at the end - it was crispy enough without that. Although my ham didn't look as good, it sure tasted great.

I used this for the same type of ham Chef John recommends. 
I made a small adjustment that made this recipe taste slightly different and was a HUGE hit at the table.

Instead of 1/4 cup of honey, I used 1/8 cup honey, 1/8 cup black-strap molasses (use a good quality, it makes a difference), and I threw in a heaping TBS of dutch cocoa. Holy cow!!!! It was DELICIOUS!!!
FYI...this recipe is not for pre-sliced hams. It works well for pre-sliced (my 1st time to use this recipe) but you have to adjust your cooking method and time.
Also, I didn't have star anice for the water bath so I just used about 1 tsp of anice seed.

There were few changes I did.. I didn't have Star Anise so I used the other reviewers suggestion of what she did. So I used Orange juice in place of Star Anise. Because my ham was 10 lbs, I doubled the basting sauce. I just ran out of honey on the first 1/3 c. so the 2nd 1/3 c. I used Log Cabin Maple Syrup. Becuase of this, I added a little more cayenne pepper and black pepper. All adjustments was done because we received this on Christmas Eve as a Christmas present by then money was tight already. All in all this has been the best ham recipe I've eaten & made. No more looking for glazes for a Farmer John bone in half ham this is it... Thank you very much for sharing this. By the way I cooked this for 2 hrs on the 325 setting & finished it with 15 min on Broil setting. Everything was awesome,., Now this a recipe we will use for life, thank you again Chef for sharing this.

I have made this ham several times, it always comes out a winner. I just use a butt portion ham (aldis) follow the directions and everyone loves it. It's juicy inside and crispy outside.

We made this for Easter and our daughter-in-law, who's a wonderful cook, asked for the recipe.  I added a half-teaspoon of ground cloves and a tablespoon-and-a-half of grated ginger to the glaze just because I like them.  I should have made about half again as much glaze because I ran out with two twenty-minute glazing periods to go; I don't think it was important, though.  Not wanting to spook anyone at the feast, I didn't use the torch but instead turned the oven to its highest setting for eight minutes.

Easy to make.  Be careful with convection...it will crisp up the glaze and blacken it.  After 2 years in a row, this is a family favorite for the holidays.

The whole family raved about the ham glaze! The absolute BEST EVER! I used pineapple juice in the bottom of the pan,  and added to the glaze while reducing it to a nice consistency on the stove. The hot and sweet in this glaze cannot be beat!!

I did it a slightly bit different. First, I covered the ham in aluminum foil for the entire cooking time. Second, I used 2 10 oz cans of sliced pineapple  in it's own juice in addition to coca cola instead of plain water. Everything else, including the rice vinegar was to specifications. Half the pineapple juice was added to the pot, the other half to the glaze. The coca cola was used instead of water in the pot; and, I also added 5 whole star anise instead of just 2. After the first 20 minutes in the oven, after the glaze was brushed on, pineapple slices were laid over the surface of the ham and secured into place with extra cloves. In addition to brushing on the glaze, I also injected it directly into the ham; and, repeated this throughout the cooking process at 30, instead of 20, minute intervals for approximately 2.5 hours at 325 degrees. When done, the 10.7lbs, spiral cut ham was one of the most tender and delicious hams I ever had. Great recipe. Super flavorful! Highly recommended!!!

My go to ham recipe! I make this for Christmas, I make this for Easter. I make this when I want split pea soup! The crust is to die for. Plus, I do not normally like star anise or clove, but instead of poking them into the ham - adding them to the water is brilliant! Nicely done, Chef John. I love this!

I really loved this glaze! The whole family said this is how I have to make Easter ham from now on.  I always make a spiral ham for Easter, but I felt like the glaze really didn't get into the cuts.  Maybe next year I'll just have to try a "real" ham!

I didn't find this recipe until after I had already baked the ham, so I prepared half the glaze, basted the ham, and then baked at 400 for 15 minutes.  It was delicious!  Next time I will follow the whole recipe.

This is a terrific recipe! It was the best tasting ham I have ever made. I recommend doubling the recipe for the glaze, like another reviewer said. I followed the recipe but cut the recipe for the glaze in half to accommodate the ham I had, which was only 3.5 pounds. But the glaze was soooo delicious that I wish I had made more. Thanks again Chef John for another fabulous recipe! - Jill

All I can say is "WOW"!  This recipe is amazing.  I'm not a big fan of ham but thought I would give this recipe a try & will not make my ham anyother way.  I had plenty of leftovers so I shared some with my relatives & neighbor.  They all gave it a big "high five"  & wanted the recipe!

This is the best baked ham recipe I've every used - bar none.  The glaze is terrific.  Since most recipes recommend tenting the ham with foil and placing it directly in the pan (some with and some without water), I was nervous about doing this differently.  But it was fabulous.  It was important to baste every 20 minutes or so as recommended so it doesn't dry out.  Cooked to internal temp of 140 (as recommended by many recipes) rather than 130.  It was perfect - not too dry or under cooked.  That's the only change I would recommend.

So good! I used a smoked spiral ham and made this Christmas Eve. The house smelled delicious and the ham was moist and perfect. I used the leftovers for ham rolls with my Christmas brunch The next morning. Can’t wait to make again!

We keep coming back to this recipe.  The spices in the bottom of the pan throw up the essences, but not the overpowering taste.  The key is to get it scored to just the right deepness and baste regularly!

This turned out great, all 12 dinner guests raved. I got compliments for days, even from my teenager. (He said, and I quote, “Bless Chef John.”) I was surprised how much flavor the anise/cloves added and how it permeated the ham. We used leftover ham for beans and pan fried with breakfast. Delicious each way.

By far the best ham glaze.  Wonderful flavor and basting the ham keeps ham moist.  I doubled the glaze and heated the glaze on the stove top and served it as a gravy.  As always Chef John comes through with an amazing recipe !!

I made this with a fresh farm ham that I bought earlier this week.  So it wasn't salted, smoked, or cured at all.   I also had to use dark brown sugar, since I had no light brown sugar on hand.  I used a wildflower honey from a local farmer's market that I had recently bought.

The resulting ham flavor was much more like a pork roast.  But it was great.  Everyone enjoyed it, and I will definitely make this recipe again.  It is quite easy as well.  I will definitely make this again.  I am considering using ginger ale instead of water when i make it next time.

Chef John- this  recipe is phenomenal! I will never purchase a Honey Baked Ham again. I plan on making this for our thanksgiving dinner this year but was wondering- is there a way to make this in a crock pot? I plan on making other dishes in the oven and am afraid I won’t have enough time.

This ham was the BEST ham I have ever made.  And I have baked many hams over many years.  It was beyond delicious.
My entire family loved it.  The glaze was wonderful and putting the cloves in the water under the ham was genius.  Thank you, Thank you.

My family loved this recipe, I made it as written and it was a hit! I could not find star anise, but found extract and just used a few squirts of that in the water with the cloves. What a wonderful smell as it warmed up the ham! At first i was reluctant about the cayenne, but it gave it just a little hint of heat. Wonderful recipe that i will make my go to for years to come!

Ham was really nice and moist.  I did not have star anise so just left it out.  Also don't have a torch.  It was great anyway

I like to cook and my nickname is the kitchen bitch, This ham was the absolute bomb, I'll never make ham again without this recipe. I did play with the glaze just a little bit. Added more Dijon mustard and Cayenne pepper. I taste tested it before I slathered the ham with this delicious sauce. I let my son take charge of the blow torch for the final finish. He was eating chunks off the sides of the ham like they were candy. I took about half the ham to work today, hence the nickname. The pigs ate all of it and fought over the outside pieces with the glaze on them. Big thank you to Chef John. You make me look good again.

This was my first ham. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception- couldn’t find star anise. I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of anise extract as a substitute.  As a few other mentioned I doubled the glaze  recipe.  I had a 4.5 lb Smithfield spiral cut pre cooked ham. I baked for about 1 1/4 hours at 325.  I basted every 20 minutes and  ensured the glaze was not to thin as the video instructed. At the end I turned the broiler on high and baked for 5 additional minutes when the sugar started to bubble - then turned off the heat. It was moist and delicious- I will never fear maki f a ham again. ‘This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious! We did not use Anise as we do not care for the flavour. We did not have dijon so we used regular yellow mustard and white vinegar instead of rice as we did not have any on hand. Although we changed a few things it was crispy, delicious and very satisfying. I will try next time with the dijon and rice vinegar to see if there's much difference in taste. The pinch of cayenne made it just right!

I doubled the glaze to make sure I had enough (10 lb ham).  I had plenty left over.  Used the broiler to candy the glaze and I let it go for too long.  Other than that, delicious!

I made this for Christmas and the family is still talking about it!  I used a bone in, store brand butt portion in natural juices and added half the cloves and no star anise.  I used a convection oven and baked at 15 minutes per lb.  I followed the directions otherwise and it was juicy and delicious but not too salty.

Easy Christmas night dinner just for our immediate family. Everyone loved it. Felt fancy but didn't take a lot of work. Didn't have a kitchen torch so had to use our Bic "torch" lighter but it seemed to do the trick.

I can attest that the blowtorch works. It was one of those, "don't watch the man behind the curtain" things - I saw that the famous ham store used a very large torch to glaze their hams. Almost looked like a flame thrower. Very good - thanks, Chef John.

This ham came out amazing! What's even better is that I only spent about $10 on the entire recipe -- compare that to the $$$ of those brand name honey baked hams! We had lots left over which we froze, taking small amounts out for ham with breakfast over the next few months. Absolutely worth it and will definitely repeat!

Used a 91/2 lb. shank and added garlic. Did not use torch just broiled for 3 min at end. Next time I would double the glaze.

I have made a lot of ham over the years but this was by far the best one ever.  It is always hard to decide if I purchased a great ham and the glaze was good or if the glaze was great on a good ham. Either way this was the best and so easy. A real keeper in my recipe file.

The ham was moist and flavorful with a glossy lacquer-like glaze. Oddly enough, though, most of the flavor seemed to go into the meat instead of sitting on top of the meat, which was nice. Next time, though, I think I'm only going to do one star anise, or maybe half of one. I really didn't expect that handful of spices to perfume the meat so intensely, but it definitely did.

Best tasting ham bast I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe to the 'T' except I didn't have any star anise so I just omitted it. This has been the best Christmas ham I've ever had. I will definitely make this ever year. Perfect in every way!!!!

OMG! Made this with our home-grown pig! (daughter's FFA project) I'm 51 years old and this is by far the best ham I've ever eaten...not sure if it was the recipe, the quality of meat, or both!

Followed the recipe as written and LOVED the results. We loved the taste and especially enjoyed the crispy skin. I will make this for all occasions that we have ham.

I leave of the star anise because I detest the flavour and don't want to risk a whole ham on the chance that flavour gets in to the ham.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe and it comes out fabulous every time.  The ham is so juicy and flavourful I can't stop eating it. So good!

I have made this twice now for an Easter ham.  Both times I got “this is the best ham I have ever had”-  it was the glaze!  I didn’t want to divulge that it was a cheap supermarket ham ??

This was my first time for making a honey glazed ham.  I chose this recipe because I've used several of Chef John's recipes  and they've always turned out wonderful. 
I wouldn't change anything   It was moist and delicious!!

This is the best I have ever made.  Raves from all on this new year of 2017.  I doubt the Chef John reads these blogs on this site, but wow..kudos.  Changed nothing...and it turned out perfectly.

My family usually doesn't like ham but we have one every holiday because my mom loves it so much-and we always have leftover ham that no one will eat.  We have used this glaze twice this year and everyone loves it!  It has the perfect mix of sweet and a hint of spicy.  I don't have a torch so I just broil the ham for a bit to finish the glaze instead.  We will definitely use this glaze for years to come.  If you make it, don't expect to to have any leftovers.  We haven't so far.

Loved it!  I didn't have the star anise, so I used fennel seeds.  And, we didn't want a crunchy skin, so, instead of torching the ham, at the end, I didn't put the glaze on at the end.  I've never, in my 42 years of life, eaten the skin of a ham.  This ham was so tender and juicy, everybody ate the skin and all.  Very tasty.  I will be making this ham several times a year, for the rest of my life.  Thank you Chef John.

Made this ham for Christmas dinner this year. Fantastic recipe  and I followed it exactly.  The crust was so good and had a little kick of heat to it.  Would highly recommend it and I'm definitely going to make it again!

I subbed xylitol and a bit of molasses for the brown sugar, and it came out great.  I added fresh cubed pineapple to the pan then turned the heat up to 500 for the last 10 min or so.  Tasty and relatively easy.

I made this the other night for my family and it was delicious! I omitted the cayenne pepper, otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. I also used the drippings for gravy, it was a little sweet but good. Definitely making it's way into my cookbook.

Really tasty but IMO would be better without anise. Found I needed a lot more water than stated. Also the torch didn't do much, maybe because I just have a cheap one.

I'm fairly new to cooking, and it was super easy. Everyone at my Easter dinner LOVED it. I used a regular ham, so I was grateful for the temp tips on that. This will be a holiday staple in my house!

I'm making this as I type, sneaking bites and tastes delicious! (Think of the dad on a Christmas story) I don't have a kitchen torch, and I want the crispy skin, any suggestions?? It won't fit under the broiler either.

This is another winning recipe by Chef John!  We served this at a NYE party and it was a huge hit!  I bought uncured and unspiraled Niman Ranch ham from Costco.  It was delicious.  I made the mistake of using all the glaze at the beginning so I basted it every 15 mins.  There were some whole cloves to pull off the ham when it was all said and done.  I'll follow his directions to a T next time.

Perfect! I repeat, PERFECT!! It came out absolutely amazing and beautiful. And this was my first time making a whole ham! Thank you, John. You're a wonderful teacher.
