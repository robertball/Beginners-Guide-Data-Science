This recipe was excellent!  I think it is unrealistic to expect it to taste "just like" lobster.  Of course it doesn't.  But it IS a similar taste and the texture is good too.  It was tender and delicious.  IF your favorite way to eat lobster is diped in melted butter, and IF it is a treat that you simply can't afford very often, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this recipe as a substitute.  With boneless chicken breasts on sale so often, this is absolutely a perfect way to serve them.  We cooked them on a grill, and just until done, which was about 20 minutes as the recipe said, turning them often.  I think the smokey flavor helped.  We marinated the chicken only about two hours-- next time I might marinate over night.  EVEN if you just think this tastes like chicken, it is EXCELLENT chicken.  I would absolutely recommend it and absolutely recommend savoring each bite dripping with melted butter.  YUM.  Thanks to the person who posted this!

We loved this chicken! It didn't REALLY taste like lobster, but the marinade was excellent, the chicken juicy, and I liked the butter dipping idea. I did bake mine for 30 minutes at 350. Husband suggests next time a little Old Bay seasoning for more of the seafood taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my! Absolutely loved it!  I prepared this yesterday for my family..hubby and grown sons..and got rave reviews from them all. I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I did, that wasn't stipulated in the recipe, was give the chicken breasts a bit of a pounding to further tenderize before marinating, but not enough to flatten. The descriptive words that were passed around the table were: MMMMM, Delicious, Soooo tender & juicy,  WOW thats fantastic, don't lose that recipe. I discovered that a tin of pineapple tidbits has just the required 1/2 cup of pineapple juice in it (so I didn't have to go out to buy the juice) and I used the pineapple tidbits in a dessert.

You have GOT to try this!!!  The chicken is excellant - it sounds weird to did it into butter but wow is it good!  I will be making this several times.  I did marinate for 24 hours so the flavor really carried all the way through.  This is a don't miss!  I am not getting into if it tastes like lobster - who cares - it tastes great and that is all my family cares about!  Thanks for sharing!

My man fell in love with me all over again. I only had boneless skinless thighs, but they soak up the marinade just fine. I've never cooked a marinade before, but I'm thinking this will be the new standard recipe I use. Takes more time, but worth it...and the butter was a wonderful (if sinful) touch. Works great on kebabs too! UPDATE: just want to say that I use this recipe all the time and it always turns out scrumptious. Tonight it was blsl thighs and bone in drumsticks. DBF asked if I had put bacon in the marinade :D heehee! I did make one sub this time; used the juice from a jar of Dole tropical fruit in juice instead of straight up pineapple juice.

I thought this chicken was excellent! It does have a similar taste and texture to lobster when dipped in butter. I made this last week and am making it again tonight because even my picky husband liked it!

I've been using this marinade all winter. I actually thought I'd already rated it. Depending on how much chicken I am preparing, depends on how much oil I add to the marinade. Overall, I'm sure I use less. I used garlic powder and added no more salt to the recipe than is in the soy sauce. This is an EXCELLENT recipe. I've broiled it and am looking forward to grilling it this summer. When I take BLSL breasts out of the freezer, I add the marinade to the frozen breasts and let it thaw in the marinade. Very tasty! The melted butter dip contributes to the "illusion" of lobster, and is very good. But not necessary to enjoy this dish. Bon apetit!

This was FABULOUS!  Now, as far as it tasting like lobster...it tasted like lobster kind of like grilled portabellas taste like steak...every now and again you get a bite where you can *see* it, but otherwise, not so much.  However, that doesn't mean it doesn't taste GREAT!  My only *complaint* is it was a bit salty (which is so weird for ME to say...Mr. LTH looked at me like I was nuts when I said that out loud)!; I think next time (yes, there WILL be a next time) I will use reduced sodium soy sauce.  THANKS for a great recipe!  Oh, I cooked the marinade in the morning & put the chicken in the frig to marinate all day (about 12 hours).

My family literally requests this recipe weekly; it's that good. Here's a sauce they prefer to the dipping butter (although, it's more caloric): add 1/2 stick butter to 2 T. mayo and 5 T. cream cheese. Add 1 t. cayenne pepper, 2 T. chilli powder, and 2 T. grated parmesean cheese. Microwave until softened.

It was ok, nothing special.  The marinade was good, but not great. I wasn't expecting it to really taste like lobster, so there was no surprise there when it didn't.

This is hard for me to rate. If I were rating it for actually tasting like lobster it would get one star. If I were rating it on deliciousness, I would give it a five. I'm torn! This was some darn good chicken. Did it taste like lobster? Not so much. BUT it made some very juicy, tasty, yummy chicken. I will use this marinade often...but I won't tell anyone that it is supposed to taste like lobster. ;-) What the heck. I give it 5 stars cuz it's just that tasty.

Great recipe that we all had a grand time chowing down on, however, to even think this tasted anything like lobster is another story. Well, I suppose if you dip anything in butter it would taste like lobster or even crab for that matter, but this certainly did not because I chose to save the marinade which I simmered and thickened with cornstarch to serve as a sauce. If you're really looking for mock lobster I suggest Monk fish which is known as "poor man's lobster." Joyful Mamma, thank you so much for this oh so yum recipe that I'll certainly make over and over again!

I only gave it a 4 becasue I changed it but it is very good and will make this often.  I changed soy to 1/4 cup, vegatable oil to olive 1/8 cup, garlic salt to garlic powder (soy has plenty of salt) and 2 breast an 4 skinlees legs becasue my husband likes dark meat. Put them on the outside grill and yum yum.

Made recipe exactly as called for. It tasted to me like a version of teriyaki chicken. No lobster texture and I did not expect it to taste similar to lobster as I read reviews before trying this recipe. The chicken was moist and tender and did have a decent flavor. As another reviewer said it just depends on the person's taste I guess. I would encourage someone else to try this though as they may love it.

Wow!  These were really good.  The marinade was wonderful.  I marinated them about 2.5 hours and it was perfect.  I also clarified some butter and dipped pieces in the butter and it was great.  It was really good without the clarified butter also!  My husband loved them and he usually doesn't like marinated chicken.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This did have the consistancy of Lobster somewhat. I'm not sure about it tasting like lobster but it doesn't matter. It was some of the best chicken we EVER had. It was so moist and flavorful. Cant remember having had chicken breast this moist. This recipe will be used many, many more times. Thanks for sharing!

This was ok- no one but me in my family liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This must just not be for everyone.  The good news is that the night wasn't a total wash; I made a little toy out of pipe cleaners that my cat is really going crazy for right now.

This doesn't taste much like lobster, but the marinade was definitely good!!   We all thought that it was way too salty though, so I won't add as much garlic salt the next time that I make this. This recipe is a keeper!!

With Lobster at $20/lb and split chicken breast at $.88/lb you can bet your bottom dollar that this tastes enough like lobster to make it worth having again and again.  We LOVED this recipe.  marinate the chicken for at least 3 hours, slow cook over the coals until just barely done, dip in melted butter and savor the flavor.  I have very few "go-to" recipes, but this is one that I will always make :)

I am rating this based on the taste and texture of the chicken, not on it tasting like lobster.  I didn't think it tasted similar, however I also didn't dip it in butter b/c I was just wanting a good grilled chicken.  This is an awesome marinade and we loved it!  The BF thought it was great!  He commented more than once on how tender and juicy the chicken was!  Full of flavor after marinating just 2 1/2 hours.  This will absolutely be added into our rotation!

I made the recipe exactly as described and the chicken was a hit with the hubby.  I thought it was a nice, subtle change to the routine chicken dish whether it tasted like lobster or not.

Couldn't wait to try this! Was leery about using Soy sauce and then adding the salt; but I thought I had better not change a thing to compromise the taste. I am glad I didn't change a thing. Other than texture, this is amazingly like lobster and I WILL make this MANY MANY TIMES AGAIN! Thank you soooooo much for a Poor-mans lobster!

Followed this recipe to the T except used boneless thighs instead of breast.  I also marinated it overnight.  We really liked this.  I thought it was going to have an asian taste to it, but it really doesn't.  We couldn't really pinpoint the great flavor but both decided we would love to have it again.  Served with rice and peas.

This was really tasty and yes it does have a lobster-ish taste to it. If I hadn't been looking for that flavor, would I have made the connection? I am not sure.. but it does have a bit of lobster texture and flavor to it.. not as rich but for those of us who cant afford the real thing, this is good. I tried it plain, dipped in melted butter flavored spread as well. Both good. I will try it with lemon juice tomorrow when I have leftovers.. Thanks for the really neat idea

I wasn't expecting this to actually taste like lobster (Maine girl here), but I made it anyway based on the reviews here.  The only flavor that carried through was salt.  I used low sodium soy sauce and garlic powder rather than garlic salt but it was still gag-worthily salty.  My husband and I didn't even bother to melt the butter before we tossed the inedible chicken in the trash.    The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one is that the chicken was very moist and tender.    The only reason

This seemed to go over well, but no one seemed to think it was lobster or tasted anything like lobster. I marinated chicken breasts for 24 hours before putting them on the grill. I used leftovers to make chicken salad wraps for lunches.

Whether it tastes like lobster or not doesn't matter, this is great chicken!  The only time I thought it might taste like lobster is when it was dipped in butter.  We loved it dipped in butter, but it was really good on it's own too.  A very tasty marinade!  The only changes I made were using low-sodium soy sauce and using 1/2 tsp. garlic granules instead of 1 tsp. garlic salt, to cut down on the sodium.

I grew up in Maine and ate a lot of lobster! This  was so similar to lobster. I couldn't believe it. It was absolutely fantastic, so tender. I will never cook chicken any other way. This is now a weekly must for us! Thank you!

This recipe is very disappointing.  It taste like teriyaki.  Being Polish I think it is more of an insult to the nationality. Polish food is great this is not!

Delicious! I marinated the chicken for a little over two hours, after cutting the breasts lengthwise in half (forming lobster tail-shaped pieces!). Longer may have resulted in its being too salty, given both soy sauce and garlic SALT (not powder). Dipping in melted butter is what takes this over the top! I think the marinade, possibly the pineapple juice, gives the chicken a hint of sweetness and a velvety texture, which brings lobster to mind. Loved this recipe and will be making it often!

This recipe did taste like lobster! So much so that my BF was a little weirded out that he was eating chicken but it was so much more like lobster.  I know this sounds like just a teriyaki marinade but it's not, something in it changes the texture!  Dipping it in butter helped too :).  Although I really enjoyed it, my BF does not want me to make it again- he thought it was too weird!

This was really good! I've been in a bit of a "chicken slump" lately, because we eat it a lot & I'm getting sick of the same boring recipes. I ended up marinating this for a lot longer than I intended (48 hours), but I think that helped make it really moist & yummy. The only complaint I would have is that it was a little salty, even using reduced-sodium soy sauce. Then again, maybe that's because I marinated it for so long :). And I'm not a big fan of butter, but I tried it dipped in melted Smart Balance butter & it was delicious! Thanks for a fresh new recipe to get me out of my slump! :)

Excellent concept and flavor.  I did not have any ginger so I used a little tumeric and cinnamon. Also, used orange/pineapple juice. No leftovers.  My two year old ate as much as we did.  Easy recipe because we all have most of the ingredients already.  This tastes great regardless of what you use. Very difficult to mess up too. Thanks for the simple and yummy recipe!

Though this was a very tasty recipe, I did not get the "lobster" effect at all.   I had the feeling it wouldn't as I went over the ingredient list because this is very similar to the Teriyaki recipes I prepare.  I like this recipe, however. It went over well.

I added half the salt asked for but my wife and I still found this to be very salty. However, the kids still enjoyed it.

We're big fans of lobster and have it often. Originally we'd always have it steamed but we have since moved on to grilling it (stuffed lobster), broiling the tails, and lobster thermidor. The texture and flavor of this was nothing like any lobster we've ever had.

In the future I'm going to cut back on the soy and omit the salt (using only garlic powder). It can be a great marinade but associating it with lobster just leads to an immediate disappointment (for us, at least). 

Also, I served it with my usual style of clarified butter for lobster-- a splash of lemon juice, dash of paprika, and pinch of pepper. Definitely be sure to use unsalted butter for this recipe, or cut back even more on the soy sauce/use a reduced sodium one. I used regular Kikoman soy sauce.

As far as ingredients go, I followed all directions. Due to unforseen circumstances, the chicken sat in the marinade for about 36 hours. We grilled it outside on a beautiful Virginia afternoon. It was a tad on the salty side, so next time I may use fresh garlic or powder instead of garlic salt. (i'm sure the soy sauce added a lot of salt) The chicken was very good and very moist. As far as it tasting like lobster..when I did dip it in butter, I could detect the subtle taste of lobster. Without the butter, no, but it was still very, very good without the butter. Later, I dipped a piece of sourdough bread in the butter and I detected a hint of lobster..so perhaps the butter holds the lobster taste? Anyway, along side of this wonderful chicken, we had a spinach salad and grilled mushrooms, onions and zuchinni squash. I will continue using this recipe. We loved it!

I don't know about it tasting like lobster but this is the best chicken marinade I've used.  I went ahead and marinaded the breasts overnight and when my husband grilled them they were still so juicy I had to check to make sure they were fully cooked (they were).  They just melted in your mouth.

This was a hit with the family. The kids loved dipping it in the butter. I did think it taste like lobster, my husband thinks its just "wishful thinking". I was afraid the marinade would be too salty, but it was fine. I think next time I will try it with fresh garlic and ginger. Thanks for a new one to add into the rotation!!

Recipe was very moist and my DH loved the flavor; but we are both from the East coast and enjoy lobster and this does not resemble lobster.  I think some may have confused dipping the chicken in the butter for lobster--either way, the recipe was pretty good.

A recipe that I will definitley make again. Family loved the moistness of the chicken and I loved the subtle sweetness from the pineapple juice. You know it's chicken, but it does remind you a *little* of lobster. I served with plain brown rice and veggie stir-fry medley w/ a brown sauce. YUM!

This is really yummy!  I thought it tasted like lobster. I dipped it in butter.  Whether my experience was psychological or not, this chicken is moist and flavorful.  I omitted garlic salt totally and added some garlic powder, but maybe fresh minced garlic would be even better.  We're saving this recipe!

It was very good. We thought it tasted like lobster the texture even was like lobster. I will definately make it again. The only thing I think it needs is a little more brown sugar, because lobster has a sweeter taste.

Very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly (had to learn how to do clarified butter).  My family enjoyed it.  It doesn't taste like lobster, but it tastes great!

I don't eat lobster myself.  Never tried it.  But my husband loves lobster!  He said this is amazingly like lobster.....an 8 on a 10 scale!  This is a very delicious recipe!  I only marinated 2 hours.  I sprinkled with old bay before grilling as another review recommended.  I used Smart Balance low sodium butter for dipping.  I would give this 6 stars if I could! KUDOS!  May try a longer marindade just for giggles next time and see what happens on te flavor.  But 2 hours was wonderful!  Very moist and tender and juicy all at the same time!!!

AWESOME. I really wasn't sure how it would taste and thought I'd have the butter on the side "just in case" with a bottle of bbq sauce on the table. Neither my husband or my 3 boys touched the bbq sauce, and neither did I. The chicken was so tasty dipped in the butter. We used "Smart Balance" with flax oil to be a little healthy, but it was so good. Will definately make again. Chicken was moist, the soy was not overpowering (my husband doesn't really care for soy). I am pretty picky and I was very impressed. Try it once what do you have to lose?  Will most definatley make again and again, and again....I don't see how anyone would not like this one.

This was one of the best chicken marinades I've ever tried.  I didn't use the melted butter to dip the chicken as it was so good alone.  This is a recipe I will be using all summer on the grill.  Thank you!!

This was fantastic! Made as recipe stated, except I ran out of ground ginger so the recipe barely had any.  It was a huge hit with the whole family and it is great even without the butter for those of us who don't want the calories! It's a pleaser!

I didn't expect it to taste "just like" lobster, so I wasn't disappointed when it didn't. It was so delicious -- I made it exactly according to the recipe (reduced sodium soy sauce) and it was some of the best chicken I've ever made, tender and juicy with great flavor. Some reviewers said they baked this, but I thought the grilling process added great flavor. The only thing I'd do differently next time (and there will be a next time) is to double the amount of sugar (personal preference).

Simply delicious! If you serve this to your kids, and tell them it's lobster... they'll never know the difference. To a refined palate, however, you just have to use your imagination ;-) Either way, very tasty!

Very good!  I wouldn't change a thing.  Did taste a lot like lobster!  So cool!  I used breasts and breast tenderloins and the tenderloins came out moister and like more of a lobster consistency.

This is surprisingly good!  As other reviewers have stated it's not lobster but then again, I think you dip any white meat in butter and you will have some resemblance.  Regardless, fix this just as instructed with a 2 hour marinade time and our entire family devoured it.  Very good recipe!

I cut into smallish strip, marinated for almost 24 hours, and broiled and it was a bit too salty. That said, my picky 16 year old and I enjoyed this chicken and spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out just what could make this chicken sort of remind you of lobster now and again. Will definitely try again!

I came across this while looking for lobster recipes. Our lobsterman son wouldn't eat it but he won't eat lobster either...Easy to make,dipping it in butter still didn't make it taste like lobster..Good chicken recipe though..

This was really good. Didn't taste like lobster OF COURSE but it is worth making again. I cut back on the soy a tad as some others said it was salty and it was perfect for us. I didn't have time to clarify the butter just melted it and dipped. Delish!!! I'm thinking this one will def be making it into my rotation =))

This was delicious. As for tasting like lobster,not really. However it did taste great! I used reduced sodium soy sauce, other than that followed the recipe exactly. I let it marinate about eight hours, turned out juicy and flavorful. This was easy and I will definetly make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I used the exact ingredients called for. Made chicken breasts and thighs. The only thing different was I seared the meat for a few minutes before placing in the oven. (It was raining and I couldn't use the grill.) My daughter said that the breast did indeed taste like lobster dipped in butter and the meat was so tender. I ate the thighs but did not dip those in butter. The skin on the thighs tasted like a Hawaiian dish. YUM.

Great grilling recipe, turned out AWESOME, will use again in the near future, didn't taste to me like lobster although the tenderness of the white meat chicken breast and being as juicy as it was, was a real treat. A must try for anyone looking for juicy white meat chicken recipes.

This is my new favorite way to grill chicken.  I first tried this "lobster" this summer and don't know if it was the marinade, the cooking on low on the grill or the combination of the two, but everyone in my family love, love, loved this chicken!  Now ,I don't know if it actually had a lobster taste at all, but that's beside the point, this is a must try recipe!

Wow, this was really a delightful surprise.  When I try a new recipe my husband usually says "It's OK".  Not this time.  He just kept eating and in between bites saying "It's like an illusion.  By the way, I broiled the chicken instead of grilling and it was still excellent.

Does it taste like lobster? No. But was it fantastically delicious? Yes! Soy sauce is plenty enough salt, so I used garlic powder in place of garlic salt, and am still thirsty, hours after eating. We did dip this in melted clarified butter. I will make this again.

Loved it!  Didn't get the Lobster taste, but then I didn't have pineapple juice.  Used orange juice instead.  We we'll be having this again!  Tender and juicy on the inside, crunchy on the the outside.

This really did have a lobster taste and I couldn't believe it changed the texture as well.  I did "think lobster" while eating it and definitely dipped it in the butter.  I also marinated it for 48 hours because our plans changed and think I will do so again next time.  If you don't dip it in the butter it doesn't taste as much like lobster but still is a delicious chicken.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I love the flavor and the texture. My children love this chicken so much, I had to double the recipe. I was looking for something a little less messy than dipping each bite of chicken into melted butter so I pour a little melted butter over each piece of chicken just before serving.

Everybody loved this recipe.  The butter give it the something like lobster taste.  It's not needed though.  The chicken was EXCELLENT with out it.  My kids keep asking me to make it again.  In my opinion this has to be one of the top 5 recipes on this site.  I havent found the other 4 yet.

It's very tasty and tender.  I agree with a previous reviewer - use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

I don't think it tastes like lobster at all, but it did taste good.  I only gave it 4 stars because it just tasted like Teriyaki chicken to me, in which case it's just as easy (or easier) to buy a bottle of Teriyaki sauce or marinade.

But like others said it is very good chicken even if it doesn't taste like lobster.

This chicken was awesome!!! I used 1/4 c. soy sauce; used 1/2 t. garlic powder and 1/2 t. garlic salt; used 1/2 t. dry ground double mustard (hubby hates mustard but he never even knew it was in there); used 1 1/2 t. ground ginger.  Marinated for 2 hours and that seemed long enough.  Forgot to even try dipping in butter but this was just excellent without it.  Hubby and 4 yr old loved it too. Also wanted to mention that I used pineapple juice from a can of chunked pineapple and then made pineapple upside down cake with the meal.

I followed this recipe to the tee and it turned out great!! It really does have a texture that makes you think you are eating lobster (can't forget the butter!).  My son won't stop asking for it

I made this for my mom's birthday and the whole family couldn't stop talking about how much it tasted like lobster and how it was the best meal they'd had in forever (see my mom's review below under bkeels). I served it with corn on the cob, waffle fries, crusty rolls and angel food cake for desert.

This is truly amazing. The butter is what makes it. Your eyes tell you chicken but your mouth says lobster. Without the butter it's seasoned chicken. Add the butter and it's lobster. We will have this a lot. Its a hit with the family who loves seafood.
