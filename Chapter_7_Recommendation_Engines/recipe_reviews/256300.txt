I'm a busy Lady, so anything involving a slow cooker is very appreciated. This recipe was not only very convenient, but it was extremely tasty! I didn't have any ancho chili powder, so I used chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes. I will be making this again and I'll probably have to double the recipe because 2 1/2 lbs. of pork disappeared very quickly!

This recipe screams tacos or burritos! I drained the can of tomatoes and added the liquid to the slow cooker. I added the diced tomatoes after shredding the pork so they wouldn't get mushy. Great flavors and no doubt this recipe would work just as well in a pressure cooker.

I am a huge fan of crockpot meals.  This was so fast to prep in the morning. The roast was so tender and enjoyed by everyone in the family. My only suggestion would be to ensure you get a boneless roast; it will make cutting / shredding much easier.

The flavor of this and the chunks of tomato were very good.  However, the pork was a little dry.  Next time I will either cut the loin into a few pieces before cooking or use chicken.  There was also no need for the water, I will omit that.  I will definitely try it again, just slightly differently!

Omg this is so easy and good! I'm not sure you need the water cuz the tomatoes are undrained and the meat provides liquid during cooking, but it's so good!

Really moist and easy! Would be great in tacos or a pulled pork sandwich. I served mine with rice, which was also good.

Very easy to make. I made it in the morning before work. I got a boneless pork tenderloin and chopped it into cubes before I put it in the crock pot, which made it easy. I added carrots to it, which my kids like. I then made rice to complete the entree as suggested. We tend to like spicier food - so next time I make this - I may add more spices, but the kids liked it the way it was!!!!!

This was a very simple and tasty recipe. I used a 3 lb. pork loin, which is what I had on hand, and omitted the water as other folks mentioned. Also used Mexican chili powder. Served over brown rice and steamed green beans. Soooooo yummy! Will definitely add this to the rotation!

This was so very simple to put together while being a flavorful and delicious end result.  I did not have oregano on hand so I  substituted my favorite go to McCormick Grill Mates Roasted Garlic & Herb seasoning.  Served over basmati rice with a side of green beans, the two fussy males of my household gave it a thumbs and the "Keeper" award!
