Very yummy!  I added about 1/4 cup parmesan alfredo sauce to the dough before spreading the pesto sauce.  I also cut the pizza in slices and served for dinner.  My husband asked me where I bought the pizza from.  It looked and tasted like a gourmet pizza.  Thanks, Ann!

DELISH! For starters, I chose to use a crust recipe from this site (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust - scaled to 1/2). Then for the Pesto, I used a recipe from this site (Pesto..by Valerie) and it in itself was a 5* - simply amazing. To the Ricotta I added 1t minced garlic and blended with Asiago (I substituted freshly shredded Asiago for Parmesan because it's what I had on hand - I don't see anywhere in the directions where it says to use the Romano, so I used all Asiago). I spooned 3T spaghetti sauce from a jar onto the Pesto (we love sauce) before laying down the Ricotta blend. I topped with Roma tomatoes, 1 cup diced cooked chicken, 1/2 can drained artichoke hearts, 2oz sliced fresh mushrooms, 1/2 of a diced red pepper, 1/2 of a diced green pepper, small can of sliced black olives, and more shredded Asiago to taste on top. Baked on pizza stone. Reduced cooking temp to 375 and increased cooking time to 30 mins to enable heating of so much topping. We couldn't get over how fabulous this pizza tasted - like something from a restaurant! The crust was perfect and the Pesto made the recipe! Thanks for such an inspiring base pizza - we will use this over & over!

We had some leftover homemade pesto that we used for this and loved it. We also added canned mushrooms, artichoke hearts, fresh spinach and red onions. This was spectacular!

Maybe I had lame pesto or something but I think maybe that "smidge of tomato sauce" that is purposefully NOT on these pizzas would be a good addition.  My homemade-pizza-loving family didn't like these and if I make them again I'll layer on some pizza sauce.

So tasty! I added small slices of proscutto. You can also use capacola! For extra garlic lovers like my family, I thinly slice a clove of garlic and put that on top so it gets crispy in the oven.

My family had an "Appetizer Night" for dinner and this was a hit! I helped my little sister make these and we didn't change a thing aside from using lower calorie ingredients.

I really liked this pizza!  I used the refrigerated pizza crust in a can (which is one thing I would do differently next time; the crust was not as thick as I would have preferred) and I used only one sliced tomato.  I also added some chopped mushrooms and lightly sprinkled some onion and garlic powder on the top.  I added just a touch of shredded mozz & sharp cheddar.  I have to say... this pizza is not for everyone.  I think that if I tried to serve this to most of the people I know (who LOVE their meats and cheeses), well, they'd probably only eat a square or two.  Myself - I prefer my pizza sauce, but this was a VERY nice change for a very delicious pizza!

This is a very easy and quick recipe that we all loved! We have now tried them with lots of different crusts (english muffins, tortillas, flat bread etc.). We even made them it in a panini sandwich. Used mozerella rather than the ricotta.

I added alfredo sauce, chicken and mozzerella cheese. I didn't add the tomatoes. My husband really enjoyed this. I didn't care much for it.

I used a pre-cooked brick oven pizza shell. I also added diced marinated artichoke and kalamata olives. So easy and very good.

This was definitely the best pesto pizza I've ever had!  The combination of the cheeses was fantastic.  Didn't eat the whole pizza, and the next day the cold slices were still great!

Good, but didn't like the ricotta cheese on a pizza. Will try another pesto pizza recipe without the ricotta.

This was a great easy to make recipe that will definitely make it to one of my "go to" meals.  I substituted the ready made crust with a Boboli Whole Wheat crust to make a little more health conscious.  People kept asking for more!  Next time I will try to top with roasted pine nuts or walnuts!  (Tasted even better when served at room temp)

This was excellent quick meal. I like the pesto flavor instead of traditional pizza sauce. Will make again & add different toppings.

Fantastic flavor!  I did, however, make one huge alteration and that was to use shredded mozzarella in place of the ricotta, only because we had a dish with ricotta the other night and wasn't in the mood for it again.  Worked out perfectly!  I used the quick and easy Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough recipe from this site, and sprinkled a little dried oregano on top before baking.  Delicious!

This was pretty good. I liked the flavor but I didn't care much for the mushy texture of the ricotta cheese. I'd try this again only using feta, parmesan, and some provolone instead.  It was hard to spread over the pesto, it sort of just mixed together. I used quick and easy crust by Amanda Rider for this. My son didn't care too much for this he said it isn't pizza without the tomato sauce. Thanks for posting this as I enjoyed trying something different.

This was so good.  I misread the recipe and mixed the pesto w/the ricotta.  After I realized my mistake, I spread a thin layer of just pesto on the pizza, sprinkled a few spoonfuls of parm on that, and then added the ricotta/pesto mixture.  Then I sprinkled some parm on top of that (not nearly as much as recipe states).  I think my mess-up was actually a good thing, as it was really good this way.  I left the tomatoes off of my kids' portion and they loved this pizza too, especially my 4-year old.  Using a pre-baked crust made it so easy.  I used low-fat ricotta.  I made my own pesto (Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto from this site, which was sooo good).  This is one I will be making again.  Can't wait to try it with tomatoes from the farmer's market!  Oh, and I did not miss tomato sauce, at all.  My hubby said it was one of the best pizza's he's ever had.

Quite tasty! Instead of romano, I used a big handful of shredded "Italian blend" cheese to the ricotta/parmesan mix. Also put a little of that on top of the tomatoes w/ a sprinkling of Italian seasoning. Next time I'll chop of pieces of chicken to add to the tomato layer.

Yummy.  I used a Pillsbury Pizza Crust in a tube and recipe as shown did not make enough to cover the crust - luckily I have picky boys and used regular sauce and mozzarella for their half. Good recipe though!
