I love these cookies! But, as in other similar recipes, I've had to cook them at a rolling boil for at least 3 minutes, for the butter, sugar, milk and cocoa to get to a soft candy-like stage. (Where you can drop a small amount into a cup of cold water and it will form a tiny soft ball.) Then I had to add 1/4 extra cup of oats! They were perfect! These are really easy to under or over cook!

These turned out just as expected! I myself find them a tad too sweet but that's just my taste, everyone else loved them and I will definitely make them again. I didn't change anything in this recipe and probably won't next time either. Edit* I cooled them and let them set in the refrigerator for a couple of hours and they set well once they cooled thoroughly.

Excellent as written! The only thing I changed was that I used old-fashioned oats instead of quick cooking because it's what I had on hand. We loved them!

I’ve made this recipe twice. First time I made it exactly as written. The cookies are flat but they ARE moist and don’t dry out. The second time I added 1/2 cup more oatmeal and that gave them more body and they were still moist nor did they dry out. This is a great recipe and I’m glad I found it!!

First time I've ever made these cookies. My fiance requested them as they are his favorite Christmas cookie.
I made them exactly as the recipe was written and according to him they were excellent and perfect!
Too sweet for me but that means he gets them all!
I predict I will be making these quite often from now on. Lol

These didn't work at all for me. They didn't set at all and were WAY too watery. The search continues...
