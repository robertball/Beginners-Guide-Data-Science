This was awesome. I changed around the ingredients. I added olive oil in he can to prevent the noodles from sticking after I drained  them and sauted some Jake and mixed it in the noodles.

I was a bit hesitant because there were so few ingredients, but these noodles turned out really good! I didn't need to add anything.

These noodles are just down-home awesome. My mom would make this growing up, I would make this a lot in college, and I still make it every now and then when I'm looking for something simple to make. These noodles are so versatile. You could easily tweak this with ingredients you like. I sometimes add crushed red pepper, other times I add dried minced garlic, or fresh minced herbs. The sky's the limit really! This last time I did half butter, half truffle oil - delicious!!! This recipe makes 8 very small side servings, so plan accordingly.

Tasty side dish. I used medium egg noddles which were great. They aren't a strong flavored dish so could pair well with most main dishes. I could see me liking some garlic in it too.

7.22.17  Nothing not to like here, and it was a nice option to mashed potatoes.  I often think rice or potatoes as a side dish, but forget how good noodles can be.  And I can see so many variations on this recipe to keep it interesting.

All I had was elbow macaroni noodles but it still came out just how I like them! My 1y/o never eats pasta but he sure kept coming back. Very easy to make and very tasty!

This was real simple to make. I added fresh parsley and a little bit of black pepper. It was a very good side dish to our smoked ribs.

NO changes. When I review a recipe I stick to the same ingredients. I do believe quite a  few people realize that simplicity in your meal is the best. AND I do believe a lot of food lovers forget how GREAT just a plain butter & noodle  dish really satisfies.   All the tomato sauces, & this & that are great , however the basics are still the best. Different noodles make a different taste texture, soo experiment with the noodles NOT this sauce.  Thank you as always  and I make this ALL the time. Always a crowd pleaser.  Cheers  from N.V.

This is really great. I love the gentle flavors, nothing overwhelms anything else. I made it as written and served it with smoked sausage and green beans and onions all fried together.

I needed a simple and quick side dish that wasn’t rice (both my kids made it clear they were sick of rice) and I was out potatoes.  The only pasta I had on had was some rotini noodles and they worked great!  While the pasta was cooking I tossed a little garlic in a pan with the butter to add extra flavour.  When it was all done I chopped up a little leftover fresh parsley and chives (had to use them up before they turned).  This is a simple and delicious recipe ... it’s simply delicious!  It’s easy to change up to suit your family’s or your individual taste.

I was little surprised when I came across this recipe  ! I always  thought adding some butter and some Parmesan cheese to your pasta is what everybody does when you don't have any kind of pasta sauce to go with your pasta or you have a picky eater to feed ! I just realized it was a pasta dish with its own name and own recipe ! Anyway, I went ahead and tried it following the exact recipe and It was very good. And so was the similar pasta dish I used to make that didn't have a name and with just eyeballed ingredients..

I mostly followed the recipe. Scallions, shallot and garlic in a mix of Ghee and unsalted butter plus some cracked pepper took care of this dish. I left the veg pieces in the butter and added a little frozen peas (needed to use it) at the end. Used some Garlic and Chive Pappardelle from Pappardelle's at Pike Place Market., Seattle. The buttery pasta dish is a side for Calamari Steaks I'm going to flour, egg wash, breadcrumb and fry for a couple min on each side.

05/18/16 I had some spaghetti noodles that I had to use up. I used fresh cracked pepper rather than ground pepper, no other changes.  Delicious! 07-24-17 Update:  Great way to use up left over noodles. Simple and delicious!

I was looking for a way to use up the last of my leftover pot roast and this was perfect. I left off the parmigiano cheese because I served leftover pot roast on top of it. It was perfect.

Easy delicious dish of  noodles with parmesan cheese.  I use fresh ground pepper at the end.  Like better than most red tomato sauces.

It all depends on the Fettuccine you use, but I used 6T of butter and added 2T of milk as well. I kinda seems silly to look up a recipe like this, but I didn't want to experiment to get just the right amount of butter and cheese, and this was perfect. Turned out delicious! Thanks!

It does need a little oil or something to keep the noodles from clinging together

I used a box of noodles, 1/4 cup of butter and used a cup of grated Parmesan cheese. It turned out delish and not too greasy!

Hard to goof this one up. My grand kids like plain butter noddles but this kicks it up a notch with the cheese. Who doesn't love cheese!!

This was fine. Not bad, but could use a little more cheese or some additional seasonings, maybe.

I used egg noodles instead of fettichini noodles, but it tastes the same. this is my first time trying it, that is why it is a 4 star.

Quite tasty and simple to make. Egg noodles work great with this, and the basic recipe can be built upon with other spices, veggies or meats and retain its appeal. My personal recommendation is a dash of garlic salt.

Made this tonight with baked chicken breasts. I added more cheese and pepper than called for, but we love our cheese and pepper!! Even the husband liked this and he’s hard to please when it comes to pasta! We ate it all before I could snap a picture!

I'm pretty lazy. I hardly ever cook but I want to change that and stop being lazy. This is the first time I ever make pasta and it turned out great! It was so easy and took almost no time. The only twist I made was cooking the pasta a little more but thats just my preference. My measurements were pretty wacky so I eneded up putting too much butter but it was still great.

So easy to make but still really good. I added some garlic and parsley to the recipe for a little bit more flavor. I browned the garlic in about 2 tbsp of butter then melted the rest of the butter before adding it to the pasta and added a little bit of Italian parsley for some color. Turned out fantastic

So easy to make! A delicious quick meal :). I cut back on the butter, but decided it was lacking a little more buttery taste. Next time I'll just follow the instructions to the T.
