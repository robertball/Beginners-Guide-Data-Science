Did you know that you can buy pumpkin liquor now? I bought a bottle a week or so ago and have been wanting to use it for a fall cocktail. I left out the half-n-half and ice, cut back on the ice cream by a scoop and did 1 1/2 oz. of the pumpkin liquor and 3/4 oz. of the rum. Naughty! I'd make this again, especially to impress guests.

Very tasty; couldn't taste the alcohol at all though. I had to add extra milk as it was a little too thick for my blender. Also, I used cinnamon ice cream which made this extra yummy. :)

This was delicious, but the way I made them was a little too thick- I used heavy cream because I thought it might taste better. I also used a little more rum, which I regret. However, I did add an extra tablespoon of pumpkin and extra spice, which I thought gave it much more flavor.

I made some changes and they did not work out, but I am rating this highly because I am sure the actual recipe would taste better. But just so you know, cheap white rum does not work well in this recipe.

Great for a Halloween or Thanksgiving party.  I skipped the ice and used regular milk instead of cream.  Just remember to drink it before it melts!

When I made it as written we were really disappointed with the flavor which did not taste like pumpkin pie.  A good bit of tweeking made this drinkable, but not something I would make again.

Love it!  I want 4 or 5 lol!  But that'll pack on too much fat from the ice cream
