Marinating the meat longer than 2 hours just turned it to a slimy, mushy mess.  I marinated mine for 2 hours, than drained off the marinade, reserving it for later, patted the meat dry, and browned in batches in a 12-inch skillet so the meat would actually brown.  Only after all the meat was browned and added back to the pan, did I add the marinade do the pan.  Don't use round steak, it gets tough and rubbery very easy and has a livery taste, use sirloin or flank steak for better tenderness and flavor.

A couple of options regarding the marinade:  If done in a wok, cook the meat and veg first.  Put on a plate, then add the marinade to the wok and reduce.  Pour on top of the meat/veg.  If done in a skillet, make sure it is 12" which covers a very large cooking area.  Flared skillet is even better.  Make sure liquid evaporates as quickly as possible.  You want browned meat.

In either method, make sure your pan is screaming hot.

You can always add soy sauce, but you can't take it away.  So marinade your meat using 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 stock or water.

Don't marinade the sesame seeds.  As you're heating up your pan, put the sesame seeds in and swirl a couple of times in the dry pan.  Reserve and add on top of the cooked mixture.  That way, the sesame seeds get toasted, then relax to let the oils re-distribute.  Who wants a wet sesame seed?

I don't know if it's Chinese, but I added scallions (green onions) at the end.  Fabulous.

IN the end I separated the meat from the sauce, and cooked soba noodles in the sauce with some water added.

This is a great starter recipe.  Expand your horizons with it.

I made spring rolls with some, and red lettuce leaves with others.  Either way it was delicious.

We made this last night and loved it. Used london broil and sliced it partially frozen on the meat slicer so as to get those paper thin slices. Didn't have leeks but don't know as they would've added anything. As suggested, we rolled each one up in a red lettuce leaf, along with about a tablespoon or so of rice that had been cooked with chicken broth and asian seasonings. Using the lettuce made it very refreshing. Although the beef was tender having been sliced so thin, it may benefit from adding a tablespoon of water and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the marinade. This will give you beef that'll melt in your mouth! As for the heat, I thought it'd be too much, but after cooking it really mellowed and even my low-heat tolerant husband agreed that it could be bumped up a bit. All in all, great. Easy, quick cooking, very tasty.

This was a good base recipe, but it needed some changes to the cooking/marinating process.  I know from experience that if left too long sitting in soy sauce, the meat becomes de-natured and slimy.  I also didn't like the idea of all the vegetables sitting in soy sauce for hours.  I marininated the meat in 1 Tblsp soy sauce, a bit of minced garlic, sesame oil, cornstarch and 1/2 tsp baking soda for about an hour. I stir fried the garlic, some ginger and the red pepper flakes in very hot peanut oil for about 30 seconds, then added the onions, leeks and carrots (which I grated) and stir fried them for 3 minutes or so.  I removed the vegetables from the pan, added a bit more oil, and stir fried the meat until it started to become crispy.  Then I poured the sauce to which I added some sherry, more sesame oil and 1 Tblsp cornstarch over the meat and simmered briefly until it thickened.  Then I returned the vegetables to the pan and stirred them into the sauce.  This came out great.  I served it with leftover sesame noodles and my family liked it a lot.  Thanks for the post.

Gary this is DELICIOUS!  My husband and I like a little more heat and more complex sweet so I made the following changes: 1. substituted brown sugar for maple syrup
2. upped the red pepper flakes to 1 tbsp AND added 1 tbsp of Asian chili paste (we like food that makes us sweat)
3.  Added 1 can of water chestnuts
This is a keeper--thanks for sharing!

This is a great, easy recipe.  Perfect when you have a busy day coming up.  You can add all kinds of things.  I've added ginger, shallots, cabbage, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, celery and toasted sesame seeds.  A tip about sesame seeds.  You can buy them at a middle eastern market in your city and get about 6 oz. for $1.29 compared to $3.29 for 2 oz. at the supermarket. If I have a lot of veggies in it, I double the marinade and thicken with a cornstarch slurry at the end of cooking. My husband LOVES this dinner and I love making it!

this recipe screams, 'KEEPER'~!  I had a cheap old round steak I got reduce priced.  This is an excellent way to prepare what can sometimes be a tough old cut of meat.  I did not have leeks, so subbed sliced mushrooms.  I let this marinate for 24 hours before preparing.  By the time I put my rice on the stove and heated my wok at the same time and by the time the rice was done, so was this....I did add a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken a bit and served over jasmine rice.  When putting together the marinade, I used low sodium soy but was about 3 tbsp shy of the specified amt. so used regular soy.  Once I got the marinade together, it tasted a bit salty.  I added about a tsp more of brown sugar to help balance out.  I would recommend using low sodium soy since half cup is what this recipy specifies....but absolutely delish!~  I like spicy so added more tunisian chili powder. *love the sesame seeds for a little crunch and presentation.  I also added a handful of beautiful huge cashews to carry on the crunch...mmmmm wonderful addition.  This is right up there with Asian Orange Chicken from this site.

This is a great - and flexible recipe; it's a regular on my menu. I up the red pepper by a 1/2 tsp, leave out the leeks, double the carrots, and add a handful of fresh, ice-cold sugar snap peas during the last 3 minutes - or else I serve them on the side, as a balance for the heat. They really enhance the experience. I also use a lean roast for the meat, as this seems to come out more tender and flavorful.  I also splash in some sesame oil when I cook the rice - adds a complex, smoky essence to the overall dish. To cut down on empty carbs, I sometimes serve this with slightly undercooked cabbage; the sweetness of the unsalted cabbage counters the soy and spice. Just wrap a small amount in a cabbage leaf and feast! An excellent meal, and easily expandable for more guests.

I am not sure why this is called fire meat.  I put in about a tablespoon of pepper and it was hot.  I can't image there is much kick with only a teaspoon.  I put the sauce in with the meat originally, but all it really did was boil so I poured it off.  The meat has a strong sesame flavor, but that was really all I could taste.  I probably won't make again.

Very good recipe, as written.  I did Jullienne the carrots instead of chopping them, for prettier presentation..  Next time I will probably add more pepper flakes and maybe some fresh ginger.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've used the recipe as a marinade for steaks without the leeks, carrot and onion. It's a good and easy recipe that adds a lot of flavor to a steak. It wasn't too hot, which was nice and it teams well with traditional side dishes.

As others have noted, you need to add alot more red pepper flakes to make it really firey. I marinated the meat for about an hour, and was surprised at how much it had absorbed the flavors. Not bad at all. Thanks!

This recipe is great!  We rolled the meat up with some cooked white rice in lettuce leaves like little "burritos".  Also turned up the heat a bit with 1/2 of a minced habanero chile, but my family like things really hot.  Yum!

This was excellent! Super fast & easy to make! I'm a spice wimp & didn't find this overly spicy so if you like "fire" you're def going to want to add more heat.

WOW!wow!WOW!  Soooooooooooooooo good!  Followed recipe, except added an assorted mix of chopped fresh "asian" veggies that I found in my store's produce section. About 1 pound worth of mixed bok choy, red onion, carrots and something else that I couldn't quite tell what it was.(instead of the stated 2 leeks,and 1 small carrot) LOL  This dish is HOT, just like the title!!! Im glad I had the extra veggies to disperse the heat. Served with white rice and store bought egg rolls.

This was very good and an easy recipe.  I used the veggies that I had on hand and mostly just used the meat marinade from this recipe. I marinated the meat for a couple of hours, which was perfect.  I then cooked the meat, took it out of the skillet and then added the marinade which cooked for about five minutes before I added the veggies.  Once the veggies were close to being finished, I added the cooked meat back in, heated it all up together, and threw it over rice.  Quite tasty and made great leftovers the next day.

Awesome.  I mixed mine with lo mein noodles.  If you use the round steak, you MUST slice paper thin, otherwise too tough.  Sirloin or flank may be better, but I loved this.  Will make again.

I enjoyed this meal, and very easy to prepare. I used the round steak, slicing it uber-thin (best to partially freeze before cutting, but you know that!).  I didn't have leeks on hand, so just added more carrots and water chestnuts for the crunch. I also used sweet onions (again, pantry lacking red ones).  Reminded me of a round steak recipe mom used to make!  Keeper!

I served this with rice, but I it would be perfect for lettuce wraps.  In fact, I liked this better than the recipe for Asian Lettuce Wraps and would love to try it with chicken.

The only way to get any closer to traditional chinese street fair is to live in china.   Instead of red pepper flakes though I used a ghost chili hot sauce. Only a drop of the ghost chili hot sauce, and well I've got a stomach that glows more then all the erupting lava from seven volcanoes.

Wow, this was GREAT!  I left out the leeks, adjusted the red pepper flakes a little so my kids would eat it, and drained the meat mixture before "stir-frying".  I then added the drained marinade with a little cornstarch at the end and brought sauce to a boil with meat and veggies.  YUM!

FANTASTIC! I actually had more meat than called for, so I increased the ingredients by 1-1/2x. I used green onions (maybe 4-6, they were small) in place of the leeks b/c that's what I had and I shredded my carrots (I used 2 small). After cooking the meat, I thickened the sauce just a bit w/ a cornstarch slurry, so it would 'cling' to the meat better. The flavors of this are wonderful, but the heat level was a little much for us, so next time I'll decrease that a bit. I let my meat marinate maybe 3-4 hours and that was great! This is one of the easiest Chinese meals that I've made, lol. Served over jasmine rice w/ a side of  'Garlic Broccoli' also from this site. A definite keeper, for sure, and one that will be made often...WE LOVED IT! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great Make ahead meal! Also more than half veggies when you follow this recipe which is nice for someone trying to cut down on meat consumption.  I usually make a batch a night or two before and let it marinade in the fridge, then prepare half for dinner and freeze the other half for a busy night I forgot to plan for

This was quick and easy to prepare but wasn't hot at all.  Apart from that it was quite salty.  Perhaps subbing some of the soy sauce with stock, using reduced sodium soy sauce or perhaps both would be helpful...

Very very good!  I did make some changes due to the other comments.  I cut down on the soy sauce b/c someone said it was to salty.  I am dissapointed I did that b/c I felt it needed more salt and ended up adding some to my plate.  Also I added like 2 teaspoons more of brown sugar and wished I would have added even more.  Lastly I added like another teaspoon of red pepper flakes which gave it the perfect hottness. I served it with jasmine rice. This was a wonderful dish and hubby liked it a  lot to, which I LOOOOVE the praise when a great meal is put on the table...which this was!!

We loved it. Served over white rice it is a filling easy meal. As others have stated hold the marinade back and just cook the meat first. Add the "juice" after the meat is brown.

This was awesome. I made this one night because I had some meat and no idea what to do with it. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand (big plus)! I made it per instructions except before adding the chili, I divided the mixture in half and added all the chili to only one portion. My toddler ate the part without chili with no problems! The rest was very good for me (maybe even add a little more chili next time). Fabulous the next day for lunch too (another big plus)! Will be making this again soon.

I want to thank everyone for your comments concerning this recipe. As with any recipe, the hotness and saltiness can always be adjusted to one's own taste. Asian Fire Meat is still one of my all time favorite recipes.

Not bad, but not great. It was a bit on the salty side. The word "fire" should definitely not be in the title, as it was barely spicy.  The recipe for "Awesome Korean Steak" on this site is much better.

This recipe is great!  We have this at least once a month.  It's super easy to throw together and I always let it marinate overnight.  Usually serve over rice.  To get the meat nice and thin I throw it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and that makes it so much easier to slice into those paper thin slices this recipe calls for.  For those who find the salty flavor of the soy sauce overpowering, you might want to consider using one of the darker, Chinese variety of soy sauce.  The flavor is deeper but it's less salty than its lighter, Japanese style counterpart.

This would have been a good recipe, unfortunately the potential for great flavor was completely overpowered by the soy sauce.  Perhaps half of the soy sauce called for would be appropriate.

Delicious. I really liked having the leeks in there. I had 1.21 pounds of meat, so I upped the marinade (using light soy sauce) a little bit, and used a large carrot. We ate this over basmati rice and it was great.

Great recipe Gary! I had over a pound of london broil so I used two teaspoons of the pepper flakes. I loved the idea of wrapping the meat and rice in a lettuce leaf and the kids thought it was a fun way to eat it. I don't eat red meat, but the sauce was delicious over the rice. Thanks so much!

everyone loved this!  The beef was not too spicy for the kids.  I drained the beef mixture as one review suggested.  I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to it because I was afraid it was too salty.  I added one more T. of brown sugar too.  I served it with a cabbage and bean sprout stir fry with togorashi.  The cabbage side dish gave it more heat for the adults.  Don't forget lots of white rice!

This sweet and spicy. Over rice it's great. If you want it really hot, add some more pepper to it. Red, black, saracha, it doesn't matter. Just add what you like and you'll love this tonight and the next day for leftovers.

Too salty & a bit rubbery (I'll take partial credit for the rubbery :D).  I sauteed the steak separately as suggested, but it wasn't wow-ing.  'Thickened it with 2T cornstarch, served over rice.

Absolutely delicious!  I marinated for 6 hours and it was perfect with great flavor! We like spicy so I might add another tsp of red crushed peppers.

Pretty good flavor, but to me fire was misleading.  Not much spice in here.

I left out the leek and sesame seeds.  I used ground beef instead of round steak.  I used splenda instead of brown sugar and olive oil instead of sesame oil.  I lessened the soy sauce and increased the red pepper due to what other reviewers said.

Lots of chopping for prep, however, I marinated all overnight. Quick to cook and I served over noodles. Delicious!  Good recipe to make the night before.

Hi! I found this recipe to be quite excellent. I've used it a couple different times with beef, and also with chicken, and I found that the marinade compliments either meat nicely. I usually add more veggies to it though. I've added red & green peppers, bok choi, and celery, which I just sort of cut up and through in the skillet with the meat (so they still have lots of crunch). My boyfriend has requested this dish several times now, and I find the recipe useful because all of the ingredients are house-hold items for us. And you're right about having beer with it. I know you'd probably picture something rather light in colour and crisp, however, we've made a practice of drinking Guinness with it, and it is delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good and I didn't have leeks, sesame oil or seeds. I only had time to marinate it for 1 hour and everyone still loved it. can't wait to try it again with everything called for.

I thought this was great! I let it marinate over night, almost 24 hours. I also added 1 Red Pepper and Broccoli. While I was cooking it i noticed a lot of runny juices im my wok, I added aproximately a 1/4 cup of corn flour. This made it thicker. I made it for one of my friends. He was very impressed and said he will come over and eat anytime I am cooking. Thank you for the recipe and Good Job!!

This is a good recipe, however:

1. This recipe is EXTREMELY salty (almost to the point where it is inedible). I would suggest using reduced sodium soy sauce or cutting the amount of soy sauce with stock or even water. 

2. The ratio of vegetables to meat is quite high--I would cut the amount of leeks and onions by half. 

3. Contrary to what several of the commenters have written, this is not a quick recipe.  Chopping so many vegetables, thinly slicing a pound of beef, and batch browning the meat is somewhat laborious. It is by no means a difficult recipe, just that I wouldn't pull it out on a busy night.

We doubled the red pepper and left out the leeks.  We also didn't marinade the onions and carrots, we just added them right to the meat before cooking in the wok.  Also reserved some of the marinade and added when the meat was done cooking, then added some corn starch to the marinade to thicken it up.  This was excellent and we will make it again soon.

I rarely know what to do with round steak...I can't quite get it tender enough to enjoy.  This recipe helped that some - sliced paper thin.  I threw a little broccoli in the marinade, too.  After two hours i dumped it all in the pan, cooked it up....then pushed meat aside and thickened liquid with cornstarch to make a sauce to pour over rice.  Delish.

I made the marinade exactly as written.  The quality of the ingredients maks all the difference because my fresh red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp of fresh ground black pepper gave this some heat!!!  However it was way too salty for our liking and next time I'll use reduced sodium soy sauce.

We loved this recipe!  I doubled the sauce and served over rice.  Also, because some of the reviews stated that it wasn't very spicy, I added a little extra heat with a dash of Thai chile paste.  So good and easy to make.  A new regular in our house!!

Oh wow, this was good!  My husband LOVED it.  I added some fresh ginger and some worcestershire sauce to the marinade and left out the sesame oil until cooking (added to pan).  When cooking I added chopped cabbage for extra fiber.  I served over steamed rice, so the extra marinade was nice for that. This rivals anything at a good Asian restaurant!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!  I served it with Hawaiian Bread I fresh from the bread machine - the combination of spicy and sweet was awesome!

Great flavors! I did change it up a little.  
1) I used ground beef and did not marinate, browned it and set aside. 
2) I sauted 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 stalk celery, 3 cloves garlic, 1 T ginger, and 2 T sesame seeds in sesame oil.
3) I then added 1 small can water chestnuts, 1 small can bamboo shoots, the browned beef, and a sauce mixture of the soy sauce, brown sugar, black pepper, red pepper, and 2 T siracha chili sauce.
4) Served over rice with a side of steamed edamame. Delicious! Next time I may try adding baby corn and green bell pepper with some extra soy sauce.

I am about to go down and make this for the second time. It is truly one of the most wonderful dishes I have ever made. I seemed to incorporate all of the reviewers suggestions (adding chestnuts, ginger, a bit of baking soda to tenderize, xtra carrots, cashews..plus baby corn and bean sprouts & a bit of sherry). I served over coconut jasmine rice from this site. It is just lovely.

Outstanding!  This recipe is amazing!  I used a flank steak and put it in the freezer for a few minutes so it would slice very very thin.  I also added a little extra red pepper, about a tablespoon in all.  Next I drained the meat with a slotted spoon and fried it up in batches, so it would brown, then added it all back at the end when I cooked the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

I used half the red pepper flakes so our picky son would eat it.  Super easy to make, served it with plain brown rice. Will definitely make it again!

We really enjoyed this dish!  Since several of the reviews suggested that the recipe was not actually very hot, we added more red pepper flakes than it called for (1 1/2 tablespoons in all) which made it very flavorful.  Also, after reading one reviewer whose dish simply "boiled" in the pan, we did it in two batches to make sure it stir-fried properly.  I found the combination of leeks and onions had a nice depth to both the flavor and texture.  I did wish there were more meat for all those onions... or more substantial vegetables.  I'm not used to aromatics being so much of the bulk of a dish.  Next time I'll use 1 1/2 lbs of meat instead of just 1 lb.

This is really good! To me, it tastes like a pepper steak and onion dinner. It wasnt spicy, I love spicy food - so I added a little more red pepper flakes and some red chile paste. Very good, thanks!

Meat was very tender; but way too salty (and I love salt).  Next time I will reduce the soy sauce and sub with white wine or perhaps rice vinegar and add more red pepper.

I didn't use red pepper flakes, I hadn't any.  I used a red chili pepper & marinated this all day.  Stir-fryed it and served it with rice & leaf lettuce, too.  It was absolutely divine!  My husband said it was like "popcorn" because he kept reaching into the wok & eating the meat!!  I cut the meat into long, thin strips.  I also served a ton of stir fry veggies.  Such a great dinner.  This is a keeper.  I don't think that red pepper would be good for us, this with the chili pepper, had a creeper hot.  Eat-up, suddenly you're warm.  Great!  Just right!  I also used 2 pounds of meat & kept the ingredients the same for the marinade, adding 1 tbs. soy sauce. Thank you Gary!

One of my all time favorties.  My husband loves it too!  I cut back on the red pepper flakes after the first time.  It was SO spicy that I felt like my mouth was on fire.  just a bit less of the pepper flakes and it's PERFECT!

Quite good.  I've served it both in lettuce and over rice; both work well.
 I doubled the red pepper flakes upon other reviewers' suggestions.
Next time I'll add a drop more.  I let the beef marinate for twenty
minutes while chopping the vegetables.  By the time I added all the
vegetables, the beef had soaked up most of the marinate.  After
refrigerating this for another twenty minutes, all the liquid was entirely
absorbed so I just decided to cook it.  I don't see any reason why you'd
need to marinate it longer.  When I cooked it, a little liquid cooked out
and made a little nice sauce.  Also, I don't think the flavor of the
leeks is anything special -- in the future I won't bother tracking them
down and probably use a regular onion instead.

I thought this was great,,my husband thought the soy really dominated the recipe,,and I thought the sesame was strong.  We both liked the amount of spice,,,Next time,,I'll cut back a little on the soy, a little on the sesame, and maybe add a little more brown sugar.  Was good and will make again. Thanks!

This didnt turn out very well for me.  But that may be my own fault for all the changes I made. I used vegetable oil instead of sesame oil.  I also left out the sesme seeds, carrots and leeks.  I have very picky eaters, that wouldnt have touched it with that in it.  I didnt think this was spicy with the amount of pepper flakes it calls for but my kids did.  This recipe just was not for us, thanks anyways though.

It was good, but needs to be even spicier!  Add a lot more hot pepper to the mix and be sure to let it marinate a long time.  Maybe even some chili oil when cooking it?

i increased the chill pepper flakes by 5x what the recipe called for and the onions ate all of the heat. 
At 5x what the recipe calls for id rate it at 0.3/5 on a spicy scale other than that though surprisingly good.

I thinly sliced a partly defrosted pound of petite sirlion, mixed it with the recipe’s marinade without the carrots for almost an  hour (I subbed sliced pearl onions for leeks). I sauted a sliced sweet onion in peanut oil, then added a large carrot cut matchstick, then large stalk of diagonally sliced celery and about 1/4 cup of slightly hot diced pepper. I dumped the meat and marinade in and cooked for 3 minutes. My husband did not miss the browning on the meat, nor did I. Easy and made in one hour. I served it on rice.

This was really good and I definitely would make this again! Beware, if you think the meat doesn’t taste hot enough with the 1 tsp, add a ¼ tsp more, but that’s it. I made this mistake and not only added an extra ½ tsp red pepper, but also a pinch or two of white pepper. However, I felt it was lacking something and added a little ginger, which made this dish perfect! My additions did not make it insanely spicy, but the heat was notable. Remember it’s easier to add more spice or salt (in this case soy sauce) to your serving if you think it’s needed whereas it’s harder to remove the amount of heat or salt. I noted other reviewers said this was too salty, but I tasted the marinade (before adding the beef) and did not find that to be the case nor did I find it too sweet. I used San-J Low Sodium Tamari Soy Sauce. I also usded 1 lb of sirloin steak, sliced paper thin. Once the beef was done (just browned), I used a slotted spatula to remove the beef to another bowl. I tossed in a bag of Asian vegetables and continued to stir fry until vegetables were heated through (still crisp, not soggy) and added the beef back to the wok. Served over white rice. Delicious meal I would love to make again and serve the meat in lettuce wraps, along with the white rice and stir-fried vegetables. Thank you for the recipe!

We just had this for dinner. Me, my husband and my son, both of whom are VERY picky eaters. It was so delicious and such a hit that we are adding it to our family favorites recipe collection. The only thing we did different is used a yellow onion instead of red because that's what we had on hand, and also didn't have the leeks. We'll try it the other way next time we plan to have it. Still it turned out YUMMY! Oh, and because my son doesn't like rice (again, a picky eater), he had it with rice noodles. He loved it! The only change I can see us doing in the future is adding a bit of fresh ginger, but that's my our personal taste preference. ;) Thanks for the amazing recipe :)

My husband was telling me one night about a Chinese dish he use to get that he loved as a teenager, it was called "Fire Meat", so I looked it up on Allrecipes and here it was.  I used Beef tenderloin sliced thin while partially frozen and only excluded the leeks, since I didn't have any, and marinaded overnight. This was really good. I should have added veggies (broccoli, celery, bamboo etc) after cooking the meat to make it more like the Chinese takeout dish my husband remembered and to complete the meal better. Got to eat your veggies!  Thanks for recipe and bringing back good memories for my husband.

I made this according to the recipe, with the exception of only marinating the meat for one and a half hours.  My husband especially loved this dish.  I'm saving this recipe and will definitely make again!

Love!! New staple! Like another cook mentioned, I used half soy (Japanese brewed) and half beef stock to cut down on saltiness. Used double the amount of pepper flakes, but I would suggest using even more than that (where's the fire?).  I know others had mentioned to NOT use round steak, but I did and sliced it paper thin so that each piece almost fell apart in my hands and it turned out so tender and not chewy at all! I also double the marinade recipe since I always seem to have way too many veggies and not enough liquid! I marinate for 3 hours. Any less and the meat doesn't absorb enough flavor for my liking (have never marinated longer so don't know if it gets slimey). I throw it all in the pan at once and do a cornstarch slurry if I need to thicken up the leftover marinade. It turns out perfect every time!  What's great is that you can add whatever veggies you like! So glad I found this recipe!!!

Flavor was good, but the cooking method recommended in the recipe does not result in the best texture or consistency. Using a more traditional stir fry method would probably be better. Also, make sure you cut the meat very thin...

I coated my beef with flour & black pepper and browned it in small batches first. mixed sauce together in a bowl. after the meat was done, I drained excess oil, wiped skillet and added the sauce, then the meat back in. 
This was very strong on soy sauce so I recommend low sodium or cutting soy sauce with water and/or Hoisin sauce.

Soooo good. Added fish sauce, Siracha, and sweet chili to the marinade for more complex flavor. Salt and peppered the thinly sliced meat cut into 1 inch strips then marinaded for 30 mins in half the marinade. Heated canola oil to med high heat until shimmering. Added garlic and cooked for 1 min. Added meat to brown quickly (3 mins). Remove meat to a plate. Add veggies to pan and cook 5 mins until they begin to soften ( I used fresh onions carrots and broccoli). Return meat to pan with veggies to mix and heat through. Add remaining marinade plus cornstarch slurry (2 tbsp cornstarch + water). Cook to thicken 2 minutes and serve over rice. Delicious!

I used strip steak, doubled the red pepper, toasted the sesame seeds. I didn't have leeks, so just omitted those. Used a slotted spoon to transfer the mixture into skillet. I reduced the marinade after meat and veggies were cooked and then poured over the top. Served with jasmine rice.

I used a manual meat tenderizer on the round steak as I knew the meat would be tough.   After marinating 24 hours,  the meat stayed firm while I followed the rest of the instructons.  I added some cajun seasoning and a little hot sauce for more kick.   The marinade kept is strong flavor and what I added complimented well.

Spicy hot  and a bit salty. Leeks and onion and carrots are overshadowed by soy sauce marinade, so nothing subtle here.

Nothing unusual or to write home about, but maybe that is because I spend a lot of time living and working around Asia.  Do suggest that the wok be heated first then trickle oil around the wok not brushing or wiping it on when the wok is cold.  Have to agree with other reviewers concerning how long the meat should be marinated as it will become inedible due to texture change because of marinade action on the meat.

My husband loved it! As with others I tweaked it a bit. I used sirloin strip steak cut into a little thicker strips. Used sweet onion(all I had on hand) and green onion. I also added a little green pepper. Marinated for 2 hrs. Served over brown rice. It's a great recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes! It is the only way my son will eat cooked carrots. I don't usually marinate it for more than an hour, but it's still great. If I dump it all in together it seems more like a stew - maybe because I don't have a wok? I cook it in a big skillet, and reserve most of the marinade until the meat is done. Then I add it back in and cook it down a bit.

I followed the marinade recipe exactly, but I bought the stir fry beef pack from Wegmans to save time. I also just cooked it in my ceramic pan so I could skip the extra oil that comes with stir frying. Cooked up very quickly and just simmered in its own marinade. I served it over spaghetti squash to avoid the pasta calories. Will definitely make it again.

Good flavor. We live in Japan and have vacationed all over Asia. You could get better by visiting China, but this is almost as good and much less expensive than a trip across the globe.

I have made this dish several times. I follow the directions exactly as written. I have cooked it after 2 hrs as well as overnight. It's perfection either way. Served over steamed jasmine rice, this dish is amazingly delicious! Every bit gets gobbled up!

Loved this dish!! I used flank steak and 2 tbsp. of red pepper flakes since we like our food on fire! Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was delish and I will make again.

I used shaved meat and it was excellent. Because it's shaved meat, it didnt have to be marinated for that long. I only had an hour and it came out excellent. I didnt have sesame oil so i used olive instead. Definitely Korean style meat. Not hot at all. I used my own hot sauce. I recommend using shaved meat.

Did it once as written and found it a bit too salty.  I used half the soy sauce called for, marinated it overnight and drained it before cooking.  It is very good!

This recipe was ok. The smell of the marinade was heavenly, but the taste really wasn't all there. I used a sirloin instead of the round steak. Marinated it for only an hour and a half, and used crushed red pepper (all I had). I also added in broccoli to help w/ the saltiness that I kept reading about. And I only used one leek. It was big enough and we still didn't eat all of the veggies. It was good, but just needs something. May try it again with a tablespoon more sugar, add in some red pepper powder, and marinate for a little longer.

The flavor was awesome. Nice & spicy with a bit of a kick. Heated up leftovers the next day & served on a bed of lettuce. Was even better this way since my rice didn't turn out so well when I originally prepared the meat.

I didn't think that it was worth four stars, but that could've been my fault and I didn't want to hurt the recipe rating! I used chicken, which I do often in steak recipes, and the flavor itself was pretty good. Where I think I erred was thinking that what was left of the marinade in the pan was supposed to be a sauce! It was terribly salty! Not too much heat, though. As I said, I think that was my fault for not clicking together how much soy sauce is in the recipe with how salty it woudl be. I will try it again using the marinade as just a marinade.

I was looking for a different dish to make for my husband tonight; I decided to make this recipe.  I don't eat red meat, but after my husband ate this, he rated it a 4 star recipe...he loved the sauce!  Thanks, and I will make again in the future!

This was amazing! I have always known this as bulgogi. I have korean cousins who taught me how to make bulgogi and always guessed at the amount of ingredients each time but this was perfect! You took all the wory out of it for me to finally measure it all out. Though I did do just a couple things different which are also different from my own bulgogi recipe. I have never cooked with leeks or even handled them before and didnt know what to do with it when I saw it so I bought 1 each of red, yellow & orange bell peppers ( to match with the whole title of *fire* meat ) and I searched forever in walmart to find the red pepper flakes even asked someone to help me and no one could find them so I tried using crushed red pepper and sprinkled in some ground red pepper. Didnt care for the twang of the crushed and the more intense heat it packed in so hopefully when I can find the red pepper flakes it will be just right in that sense. It was a pleasant and wonderful surprise how great it was. My mother whose such a picky eater when it comes to asian food loved it instantly and told me no more take out she wants this from now on. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!! God Bless

I found this recipe to be very good, but too salty. Next time I'd reduce the soy sauce a lot. I didn't have leeks or carrots, and I used regular yellow onions.

This was too salty tasting! Did not like. If I ever try this recipe again I will use less soy sauce and red onion. Would recommend increasing the red pepper flakes as well.

This has became a favourite in my home! I use a higher quality meat (flank steak)and subsitute scallions and red bell pepper for the leeks and carrots. I recommend serving over rice noodles.

This recipe was delicious but way too salty.  I'm not sure how to tweak it to make it better.  I had an Asian beef dinner tonight that called for equal parts rice wine and soy sauce.  The flavor was good.  That is probably what needs to be done here.  I will try changing this recipe up on my own and see how it tastes.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wish I had seen Katy Belle's review before making this.  This was so salty we couldn't eat it.  Maybe if you use low sodium Soy Sauce it might be OK.

We like salt, but this was too salty!  I can't get reduced salt soy sacue here, so next time I will make it with soy sauce and water.  Other than the salt, it was yummy and I look forward to trying it again.

I love this recipe exactly as it is. I didn't realize the first time I made it that you usually eat the white, stalky part of the leek and not the green part. So that was a learning experience in leeks, and it was even better when I got it right! I also reccomend pre-boiling some udon noodles and just mixing them in when you stir fry the beef and the vegetables. Excellent!

This was so good even without the sesame oil that I ran out of. I am definitely going to make it again with the sesame oil. I also added red bell peppers. This could not be easier.

Fantastic!  We like heat so I doubled the red peppers and used white pepper instead of black.  Toasted sesame seeds, stir-fried veggies, set aside, stir-fried meat w/o extra sauce. Then added back sauce, seeds & veggies - dumped over brown rice.  So easy and superb!

This was a very simple and tasty recipe that I enjoyed making. The flavors all came together nicely and the spice was great. However, it was -very- salty, and I would recommend using a low sodium soy in place of regular. Otherwise, great recipe. Thanks!

Nothing special or too different from what I grew up eating.  I wouldn't call this "Fire" - I added the more than the amount of red pepper and some Sriracha Hot Sauce and can still barely taste the heat. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce was too salty for me and that it needed more brown sugar.  One advice for others - do NOT leave out the sesame oil or substitute it.  The sesame oil is very important in Asian cooking and gives this recipe its flair.

We all found this to be very salty from the large amount of soy sauce.  The flavour was not bad, but it was just too salty.  Next time, I think I will use less soy as well as drain the excess sauce before cooking.

YUM!!!!  This was so popular, 2 lbs of meat fed only 3 people.  Of course, 2 were teenage boys.  :) I will make again for sure.

This was really good.  Served with thw California roll Salad from this site.  I left out the carrot and leeks.  I also did not have sesame seeds.  You can really change the heat on this with the red pepper flakes.  Thanks--We did serve over rice

Thank you Gary. We loved this. It was even better the second day, next time we'll marinade 24 hours. We did use the low salt soy, outside of that, its wonderful

Delicious! The more adventurous may want some added spice though! Just add more chili flakes.

This had a great taste...but WAY too hot for us. Next time I will make it with maybe 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes if any. Maybe "FIRE" meat should have been an indication! Great recipe though!
