I did not have full candy bars--I used 12 "fun size" Snickers bars that were filched out of the kids' Halloween baskets. I did throw in a half cup of chopped salted peanuts. I kept to the recipe making no other changes. This was very simple and the end result was absolutely perfect. GREAT fudge. It's already almost gone!

This recipe is great just how it is made. We used Butterfingers and it was VERY good. Consistency was perfect for fudge. Just a tip if you don't have a candy thermometer: Take a small bowl and fill with cold water. Drop tiny bits of the fudgey liquid into the bowl. When it balls up and stays together it is done cooking. If it becomes brittle and breaks apart it is overdone. If it just stays the same consistency, it is NOT done and needs to be cooked longer.

There is a reason why there are only 3 reviews.  This fudge is terrible.    I have made fudge for years.   I decided to try this because the reviews said it was good.  It tastes bitter and sweet.  Needs more marshmallow fluff.  I kept tasting the fudge hoping I would change my mind.  It needs more marshmallow fluff.
