3.30.18  I used Spicy V8Juice for the mix and added frozen V8 juice ice cubes.  Like the frozen cubes, too, because they donâ€™t dilute your drink as they start to melt.  I used dill pickle juice and added additional cajun spice to the mix, as well as adding the cajun spice to the salt to rim the glass.  This is one very good, unique bloody mary with robust flavor.  A keeper for sure!

I boiled the whole (husked) tomatillos and diced onions first; drained and patted dry.  I then broiled the tomatillos and a poblano (while I appreciate the heat of a serrano, a poblano provides a nice chili flavor without the scoville heat of a seranno) until they just started to char.  I then put the all the ingredients in a food processer and pureed; everything then went in a sauce pan, brought to a boil, then simmered for about 20 minutes.  Prior to putting the blend into the sauce pan you DON'T need to add water, the pureed tomatillos were juicy enough.  Towards the end of simmering, which will thicken it slightly, you might want to add water; I added a 1/4 cup.
