This recipe was an excellent starter but I modified it to my taste.  I was afraid that this recipe was too spicy and reduced some of the spiciness.  It still has a kick to it. I made this for a Chili Cookoff and it won 2nd place(pretty good for getting there late).  Here are my changes:  1)  3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans in mild sauce, NOT drained.  2)  1 (15 oz) can chili beans in medium sauce, 3) I omitted the celery and tabasco sauce, 4)1 jalapeno instead of chile peppers, 5) 3 tablespoons of bacon bits, 6) 1 cup of beer 7) Instead of using 2 (28oz) cans of diced tomatoes with juice, I used 3 (14 1/2 oz) can of diced tomatoes and 1 (14 1/2 oz) can of diced tomatoes with basil/oregano/garlic. 8) I cooked this in a slow cooker for 8 hours the day before, let it sit overnight and heated it up and served it the next day with cheese on top.  I also froze the left overs and it taste even better!!

I can't praise this chili enough!  The meat melted in your mouth, the flavors tingled nicely all the way to your toes.  I just won a chili cookoff with it so that might be a large part of the reason.  The judges and the crowd loved it.  I ran out within 30 minutes of it being opened to the public to taste. I did make a few changes: I used 3 lbs of cubed chuck steak in place of the ground chuck because I really like a meaty chili (obvisously so did the judges), I cooked 4 slices of bacon, then crumbled for the bacon bits and sauted the celery, onion and garlic in the drippings.  My biggest piece of advice is prepare it the day before, let cool overnight, degrease really well and then reheat; the chili really developes a great flavor by doing this. I used my crockpot on low to keep it warm the day I served it.

This is an excellent chili recipe.  Tons of intresting flavors.  Just a few changes because I didn't have everything.  I used roasted red peppers enstead of fresh.  Used chicken broth enstead of beer.  At first it was too spicy(not for me but for my husband and kids) so I went online for a quick fix.  Turns out you just need to puree a can of pineapple to tone down the spice.  I was pretty leary about this so I added it slowly, tasting it each time.  I did end up using the whole can and it was perfect.  All the flavors without the burn.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Don't listen to the condescending reviewer from Texas.  This is a great chili.  All Texans think they're stringy meat and watery sauce chili is the best and they have to make fun of other chilis.  The rest of the world wouldn't recongnize TX chili as chili, so go with this recipe.

Very disappointed.  I hope he didn't make this down here in El Paso last year when Purdue played in the sunbowl and try to pass it off as authentic.  Most of the ingredients are from a can and taste like it.  If you want it truly hot, better add more "hot sauce" as he puts it.  Not trying to be critical, but this isn't authentic chile.  Pass on this and try another chile recipe that has the word "Texas" in it.

This is the best chili I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used my croc pot.  I browned the meat and then threw everything in the croc pot.  Delicious!

This was okay chili. The Italian sausage gave it a nice flavor, but hubby and I didn't care for it. Didn't have bacon bits. Great for a crowd. It made so much that I had to use 2 crock pots... make sure to use a really large stew pot! As far as the list of ingredients, too lengthy and too much prep time for the end result. I've had as good or better chili with half the time, work, and cost! Overall, this was decent but it didn't knock our socks off. The list of ingredients was just too long, I was tired just getting to the end of it...(my thought was, whew! did I forget anything?!!!) Nothing special, I won't make this again. I even had to throw out the leftovers. I didn't even bother to add the cost of all the ingredients!!! Overall, this was very disappointing. Thanks for posting so we could try anyway.

EDIT - Still the best chilli ever. My changes include using only 2 cans of beans, using chunks of steak (or stewing beef) instead of sausage, and if you like to keep'em guessing - add a nice tablespoon of spicy brown mustard. I've made this chilli over 10 times now and I have to make double batches because every member of my family requests it.

My husband loved this chili.  I will definitely make again.  I used 1 lb ground HOT italian turkey sausage, 1 lb HOT italian pork sausage and 1 lb ground round.  It turned out to be a wonderful flavor combination and much more healthy than 3 lbs of beef.  Since there were so many spices already in my HOT sausage blends I omitted the extra peppers and tabasco.  It was still quite spicy. I cut the chili powder down to 3 Tablespoons.  I was worried the full 4 T (=1/4 cup) would be too overpowering and mask the other flavors.  I also used a whole can of beer.  I didn't have any tomato paste so I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce. For the diced tomatoes I used 4 of the regular 14 oz cans - 1 petite diced and 3 regular size diced with chili spices included.  I also added a fifth can of petite diced which had lime juice and cilantro in it. I did not drain any of them.  Turned out wonderfully.  The flavors were great and the tomatoes of different sizes cooked up for great texture.  You can cetainly modify this recipe for your own tastes as far as spiceyness and heat.  We like spicey chili but for my 5 year to eat it I have to go a little lighter on the spice.  This recipe is difinitely worth the time and trouble.  Will make again....and again!  Thanks for sharing.

MY FIRST HOMEMADE CHILI!  I've got a huge pot of this yummy concoction simmering on the stove for tomorrow's big game.  I felt the need to bump up the amount of beer (I used Alaskan Amber) and (brown) sugar a bit but left everything else "as is".  Will post a follow-up review tomorrow.  I've got my Frito's, sour cream, sharp cheddar and Tums ready - LOL.

Update:  "Awesome", "Superior" and "Kick-A$$" were the comments I heard from folks who had this chili.  Whole pot's gone too.

I truly believe that the sausage, sugar, bacon and beer are what makes this a stand-out recipe from the others on this site.

MightyPurdue22, PLease Forgive me for I have sinned...I took this wonderful chili and turned into a vegetarian recipe!  It was so great the first time as written, my wife (who is not as enamored with meat as I am) asked if I would leave out the meat and substitute zucchini and more bell pepper.  It hurt just to think about it, but guess what?  It really is good this way.  So if you are looking for a FABULOUS vegetarian chili, just leave out the meat and put in whatever veggies you like.  Again, my apologies for this  sacrilegious variation.

I just made this recipe for the Pat's playoff game on Sunday... I thought it was amazing chili and was waiting for rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  Although everyone ate it and said it was good I didn't get any "I must get this recipe from you" and I pretty much had to ask people if they liked it, so I was a little disappointed after reading reviews that it won chili competitiions.  I went by the recipe exactly,I slowly simmered it on Saturday and let it heat up in the crock pot on Sunday. I thought it was great but some of the comments I got back lead me to believe it wasn't quite spicy enough, next time I make it I will spice it up more, although I might find a recipe with less ingredients as this one wiped out my spice cabinet!

This is my new 'go-to' chili recipe!  Between the recipe and other reviews, I ended up with a great pot of chili that we completely demolished, even all the leftovers (which just got better)!  I took a few notes from other reviews, however.  Instead of ground beef, I used a mix of cubed chuck steak and stew meat.  I started the entire process in a skillet:  I fried the bacon, cooked the veggies (omitted the green bell pepper) in the bacon fat, then used the pan to brown the meat in stages.  Between each pan of meat, I used the beer to deglaze the pan (ended up using an entire bottle of beer).  Everything went into my slow cooker.  I used a mix of beans (black, kidney, and chili beans in spicy sauce) - and all the cans I used were either 'low sodium' or 'no salt'.  Like other reviewers, I left out the Tabasco and used brown instead of white sugar.  Yummy and perfect spicy for us!

***UPDATE** This Chili recipe has now won us 2 Chili cookoff blue ribbons! It is still our only Chili recipe.

Just two minor alterations:  1)We used a whole bottle of Guiness beer and 2) only used 2 cans of spicy chili beans (we aren't huge "beans-in-chili" people) and cooked it all day on low in our HUGE slow cooker (after browning and drianing all meats) and it was fantastic!  Great flavors - our new favorite chili recipe for all football sunday gatherings! Lot's of chopping but oh so worth it in the end.

Fun to make and what a nice change from the old standby I usually make even though my family says I make the best chili around! A little involved, but if you enjoy cooking, that's where the fun comes in!

I'm using my wife's login.  First off, I make recipes from allrecipes all the time but this is the first review I have ever left.  Secondly, I never follow directions to the letter because I HAVE TO TINKER with things -- add a little here, remove a little here, etc.  Thirdly, I'm a Texan so I know a good chili when I taste one.  This is without a doubt the best chili I have ever had.  It pains me to admit that, but it's true.  As instructed, I made it the night before.  Thank God I did because it made all the difference.  Read on and you'll see why.  Based on other reviews, I omitted the bacon bits and put in 4 slices of bacon.  I cut the 3 cans of chili beans to 1 can, and I drained it before putting in the pot.  I also drained the can of spicy beans.  I cut the ground beef from 2 pounds to 1, and I added 2.5 pounds of a rump roast that I cubed.  Instead of the 2 green chilis, i put in a small can of green chilis.  As I previously stated, I prepared it the night before.  As I was putting the chili in the fridge for the night I was shocked by the fact that there was hardly any liquid at all in the pot and it tasted rather bland.  I was ticked because it was a bit of a pain to make.  The next day morning I put it on the stove to simmer all day.  Once again, not much liquid and not much taste.  For lunch I grabbed a small bowl of the chili, and while it had plenty of liquid, it was still a bit bland.  Well, the final 6 hours did the trick.  It was incredible!

I have won 1st place in 4 different cook-offs with this recipe. I've been using it since it only had 50 reviews! :)  I do replace the ground beef with 1lb stew meat and 1lb roast (which ever kind is on sale) cubed.  I mix up the beans a bit using 1 can black beans, 1 can dark kidney, and 1 can spicy chili.  The flavors are amazing as they are written! BUT the texture of the different beans and meats makes it blow the judges and crowds away!! Thanks for the WINS and the great recipe!!!

I WON!  I just won our school's Chili Cookoff with this recipe!  If you are looking for a winner than this is it.  It is superb!  The only thing I changed was that I substituted spicy Italian sausage instead of plain Italian sausage.  Also instead of bacon BITS I bought real crumbled bacon and used 1 T which is what the recipe calls for.  The key to success (other than the amazing recipe) I believe, is in how long the chili is cooking.  I cooked it on the stove on low for 2.5 hours and then switched it to a crock pot for about 6 hours - that really made the veggies get nice and tender and made the flavor wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

By far the best chili recipe ever!  My husband used this recipe for his office chili cookoff competition and has won 2 years in a row, and he's been in 2 different companies!  We follow the recipe exactly but also added cubed chunks of steak as well as cooking and using real thick cut bacon instead of the bacon bits, we then also sauteed the peppers and onions in the bacon grease.  It is a real winner!

This is an excellent recipe, delicious, easy and makes a large pot that can serve many. It's also spicy hot and if you have others in your family (like mine) that only like very mild spiciness, here are some useful modifications to make it milder and still has amazing flavor like the original.

1) Don't put in any cayenne, chili, paprika, cumin or hot sauce until then end. Even then, put in a very small amount of these starting with 1/8 increments (seriously) until you've reached the spicy hotness that works. (For some, 1/8 will work but I like it at about 3/8 or 1/2 of the original amounts).

2) Consider using 2 pounds of ground turkey instead of ground beef. This doesn't change the spiciness of course, but it's an easy substitute for a bit more healthy dish. Double the amount of beef bullion and double the Worcestershire sauce and you won't miss the beef or even notice. Don't substitute on the Italian sausage, though!

3) Skip the celery and double the onions and garlic used. It's adds more flavor and aroma that's lost when you reduce the chili spices.

4) Substitute another bell pepper for the 2 green chile peppers. At my store I can get a package of 3 bell peppers that works well, one each of red, green and yellow. (The yellow adds nice color, too!)

5) Substitute another can of chili beans for the spicy chili beans.

That's it. Enjoy!

Won 1st place in local community chili cook off! I intended to use real bacon instead of bits, but accidentally burned it. Too many beans, recommend only 3 cans. To get a nice consistent mixture, chop veggies (except chilies) into bean-sized pieces and saute them with garlic before adding to pot.  Also break up meat to bean size. To improve texture, I used crushed tomatoes (pureed works too) for one of the cans. And after it's cooked for a while, scoop out some of the liquid that comes to the top before stirring, otherwise it's too runny. Add Tabasco last, 1/2tsp at a time, tasting until desired spicyness is achieved.

Won a chili cook-off last night with this recipe.  Like others, I made a few modifications... I used 5 strips of bacon and sauteed the veggies in the bacon drippings.  I used HOT Italian sausage and didn't use chile peppers.  I added 2 cans spicy beans NOT drained and 2 cans mild DRAINED.  I cooked for 2 hours and then refrigerated overnight.  I then let it simmer on low for 8 hours before taking home the prize!!!  Everyone loved it.

This was an amazing chili as the recipe is stated but it was too spicy for my 20 year old and 8 year old daughter so I made a few changes.  I did not add in the hot sauce or the cayenne pepper and instead of the 1/4 cup chili powder, I added just half that (2 Tbsp. chili powder) and then added in just under a Tbsp. of unsweetened cocoa powder.  The cocoa still gives it a depth of flavor but without the heat.  

The result was an amazingly deep flavored chili with no heat although it almost seemed like there would be some there.  I would take a bit and definitely taste the wonderful flavor and expect the heat to come but it never did!  This is an 11 on a scale of 1-10 according to my family.  A DEFINITE keeper!

Review readers beware........don't fall for the 5 stars with 2k plus rating as it is skewed.  Let me start with this is the first review I have ever bothered to write, but I felt it necessary. Also let me say that I followed this recipe to the T which is something I never do but assumed the 5 stars wouldn't do me wrong.  For something with so many ingredients, this recipe severely lacks flavor. I was leary when the recipe called for "chili beans in sauce" rather than kidney beans and I should have walked away then. Overall this recipe is too expensive to make considering the lack of flavor and originality.

Made this for the annual UCLA-USC football game.  Followed the directions exactly, and everyone loved it!!! Don't let the long list of ingredients intimidate you. It truely can be put together in a short time. I thought I would have a long grocery list, but in fact, I had at least 1/2 of the items already!!

GREAT recipe!  To make things easier, the night before I made this I sat down in front of my spice cabinet, measured out everything I needed, dumped it in the bowl and put all the spices back. That took care of 10 of the 28 ingredients called for, so once that was done everything else was a breeze (and I wasn't drowning in spice bottles all over the counter while I was trying to cook). The only changes I made were adding 2 t. cocoa to add a little more depth and "darkness" of flavor. I also used 2 cans of pinto beans and 2 cans of black beans (drained the black beans but not the pintos) b/c I didn't have any "chili beans".  It was plenty hot enough even without spiced beans... in fact if you are serving this to kids I would cut the cheyenne pepper back to 1/2 t.  I also used a full cup of beer.  I liked the celery in it, next time I'll add more.

I made this pretty close to recipe to check it out.  Loved it!!...although too spicy for us, a great recipe to start with!!!!  I hate buying seasoning packets and loved the flavors of these but next time will cut back on cayenne and chile powder.  Lost my mind and used jalapenos, but next time will def use Hatch New Mexico Green Chiles.  Used ground tri-tip and Mild Italian Sausage...next time will use a cubed and browned beef roast and either Hot Italian sausage or chorizo. (Thought the occasional flavor of the mild Italian sausage was a little odd.)  Also used real bacon and browned veggies in the bacon drippings.    Overall...it was delicious...I think it was probably one of the best chili recipe's I've made.  Right up there with my Mother-In-Law's Texas Red (no bean) chili.  I'd love to make them to taste side-by-side...after my stomach calms down, lol!  Beans, no beans, there's room enough in this world for all of it!!  Thanks for the recipe!!  LOVE IT!!!!

I normally do not like chili, but decided to try this for my family,and it is the BEST chili I have ever made.  I will use this as my standard receipe from now on. I made it with all ground beef (no sausage) and it was quite yummy with a nice little kick.

I am not going to rate this chili recipe. This is just a chili vegetable stew. True chili does not have bell peppers, celery, bacon bits, basil, worchestershire sauce, Italiam sausage or canned beans. In the south this would never pass as chili.

This is probably one of the best chili's I've ever made.  I made very few modifications to it and it was fabulous.    First, not sure what a boilermaker is, so I used my slow cooker.  I browned the meat (including 3 strips of real bacon.  Don't do bacon bits!) and then threw everything into a slow cooker on low for 8-9 hours.      I used a bean mix (whcih I drained and rinsed) and serrano peppers instead of green chile's as I like the flavor a bit better.  I also cut the recipe in half (there's only two of us) which was good because my slow cooker couldn't fit anything more than what I made.        Freaking Deee-lish!

I used beef smoked sausage with great results.  This is one of the best chili recipes I have used. Lots of flavor and no bitter aftertaste. (Maybe because I used Keystone Light for the beer) ;~)

Very good!  I didn't put all of the chili powder in right away...think I started with just a little under 1/4 cup and I only used one tsp of tabasco to start.  Figured I go had it in later if it needed more spice.  Turned out it didnt...was the perfect amount for our family.  I also didn't use the sausage...just because I didn't have any.  Used 3# of ground round instead.

My family loves this chili.  The only thing I do different is instead of bacon bits I use real bacon and cook it at the start of the recipe and then I add the rest of the meat and veggies.

This chili is EXCELLENT! I am putting it in my file. It has a little kick to it which I really like. It tastes much better the next day, just re-heat it on the stove. I left out the fritos and made corn bread muffins. I topped the chili with cheddar cheese and sour cream.

I was really excited to make this chili!  Sadly it didn't meet expectations.  I am surprised to see so many 5 stars, to me it was bland. Although I am not sure how because it wiped out my spice cupboard. We even had leftovers that ended up getting tossed. Seems to me like it is fairly expensive to make.  I will keep looking.

I thought this would be a really great chili and was a little disappointed.  It was very good, but not GREAT.  There was something missing, or maybe it was just too many flavors being brought together.  Next time I would use an entire can/bottle of beer and maybe tweak some other things as well to get it more to what I'm looking for.

Excellent.  This will be my standard chili recipe from here on out.  I faithfully followed the recipe.  The end result was awesome.  It's spicey hot which suits me fine!  If I were to change anything, I might cut down on the cumin.  The chili improved with age and actually cooled down a bit.  Way to go and thanks for posting this recipe.

Fun to make on a rainy day.  Taste was excellent, altho I must warn everyone that it is very hot and spicy!  Next time I might cut down on the cumin and Tabasco.

This was pretty good, it was my first attempt at making chili.  I followed the recipe and put it in the fridge overnight, then put it in a crockpot and brought it to work (group lunch) and set it on low all morning.  Got rave reviews!  Served with Homesteader Cornbread and saltine crackers.

This Chili was delicious! I didn't make any changes. Nice kick, great flavor. Best I've ever made. My husband said it was better than his! Now, that's a compliment! :-)  Better the next day. This recipe made a big quantity so with leftover we made chili burritos, used it as a dip with chips,  had some with rice, and never got tired of it! I'm making it for Super Bowl Party! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Had to try this recipe because we're big Boilermaker fans.  Thought it was great; however, didn't use the spicy beans because of the kid's preference...I just let everyone add their own spices. (crushed red pepper with Frank's hot sauce)Everyone loved it.
Go Boilers!

This was pretty good. Not 5 stars but definitly deserving of 4. The only thing I cut down on was the beans since my crockpot couldn't hold anymore,however, I don't think that affected the taste at all. Oh, and added a entire can of beer.I simmered on low all night, popped it in the fridge, and now I'm enjoying a great  bowl of chili for dinner. Like others I served it up with some cornbread and shredded cheese on top. Thanks for the recipe, a definite keeper!!

Followed the recipe with the exception of 19oz of sausage and 12 oz of beer(used entire container each time). Probably the best chili I've ever had. Can't think of anything I would do different. Thanks for the great recipe

The best thing I learned from this recipe was to use Italian Sausage in my chili from this day forward.  I think that was a flavor that I had missed in my years of chili-making.  I did skip out on the peppers and celery as they just didn't sound appealing for chili.  Also I always add a can of rotel and subbed it for some of the tomatoes.  Finally, I subbed some of the chili beans for kidney beans, about half of them.  I think this would be a great recipe for the chili-beginner.

Made this on Super Bowl Sunday and got rave reviews. May have been the best I've ever made.

Ok....this is the best chili I have had hands down. My friends would agree. However, the recipes says it makes 12 servings. I had over 20 people so i doubled the recipe. Everyone had seconds AND I sent them all home with some. And I still have the whole second pot. I could've saved alot of money had I known. So keep that in mind when making for parties. It makes ALOT!!

Amazing! It was restaurant-quality and so full of flavours! We omitted the Worchestershire sauce because it wasn't available and used real bacon instead of bacon bits. I was wary of the amount of chili suggested in the first place, but finally it wasn't too much. Thanks for a great recipe!

This chili is phenomenal! I will definitely make it again. Everyone raved! My variations: I omitted the celery (didn't appeal to me) and used 2 cans of chili beans and one can of kidney beans. I also only used 2 T of chili powder instead of the 1/4 C it called for.

so far so good.  the 2 hour taste test is a success.  some things i had to change due to materials on hand: used Killian's Irish Red Lager, 1/2 a bottle (what kind of beer you use makes a difference!), used fresh bacon, 4 slices.  Omitted celery.  Browned other veggies in bacon drippings.  Substituted Kielbasa for the Italian sausage, also browned in bacon drippings.  Used 1 lb gr.chuck and 1 lb gr.turkey, again, in the bacon drippings.  Used 1 can each of dark red kidney beans, light red kidney beans and great northern beans (had no regular chili beans on hand).  All spices stayed the same.  I have to say, this was surprisingly easy to prepare, considering the rather imposing list of ingredients.  I will make this again, hopefully with the ingredients the recipe calls for, just to try it.  But the way its turning out now.... Delicious, thick, hearty, loaded with meat and veggies, with a nice solid kick to it.  I'm impressed.  And I'm a chili critic.

Left out the beer, bell peppers, chili pepper, and halved the chili powder. Substitued steak chunks for ground beef, but still used the Italian sausage. Turned out FABULOUS. Was the rave of the party.

This is the best chili ever. I did tweak a little. I used hot sausage so I didn't need the 2 teaspoons hot sauce. I used 1 can pink beans drained, 1 can dark kidney beans drained, 1 can red beans drained. I will add another can of kidney beans if too much liquid. Most important I put all the dry ingredients and bouillon cubes in a small bowl and keep adding until I felt it was to my liking. Only used about 1/2 the dry ingredients and only  2 of bouillion cubes. You can always put in more as needed. Now I have all the dry ingredients for another batch. Love this recipe I bet it will get better tomorrow

Amazing chili, EVERYONE loves it, I've made it many times now and have even made it for company.  It is a bit spicy so I don't feed it to my little one, but the adults love it, this is my only chili recipe now.  (Don't tell my mom).  :-)

Wow!!!  This was definitely the best chili I have ever made or tasted.  I upped the spices a little to make it spicy, but other than that followed it to a tee & it turned out perfectly.  Cooked it in the slow cooker for about 8hrs.  Everybody loved it.  It does make a lot though so make sure you have a really big pot or slow cooker!

Awesome chili - it's the first chili I've ever made and it turned out excellently!! I subbed two jalapenos for the chili peppers and couldn't find beans in spicy sauce so I just used another can of regular beans...otherwise I think I did everything else just as the recipe calls! I did make cornbread muffins to crush up in my chili as I eat it...really yummy with some Greek yogurt and avocado on top. I can't stop eating it!

This is not chili it is a ground beef stew! A true chili would not be loaded up with all the vegetables and odd additions like this one.  I would leave out all the canned items, vegetables, basil, Italian sausage, Worcestershire's sauce, and bacon, in particular and focus on the subtle blending of spices and meat.  Better yet, get a Texas cookbook.  And, no Frito's!  Tostado chips, please!

Very good for thick chili. I ended up adding some water to the recipe to make it somewhat less thick; however, it still ended up thickier than I personally like.  My husband loved it (he's a Boilermaker Alumni so that may have something to do with it, too)!!  I cooked the chili overnight in the crockpot, so as it was ready for football at lunchtime! It was a  little time consuming b/c of all of the ingredients - but it was certainly good.  I also used fresh bacon - instead of bacon bits.  My husband wished I had added even more bacon b/c he liked the flavor it added.  I prefer this chili without frito's b/c of it's thickness(but it would be fine for dipping as a snack) but the cheese was wonderful on top.  I only made half of this recipe and it made so much chili - we had alot of leftovers!  If you're expecting a big crowd - definetly this is a chili worth fixing!!

             BOILER UP!!

We love chili, but NOT this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly. And so, the recipe is totally disappointing. Way too many flavors "fighting" each other, and really didn't mesh well together. I don't mind putting a lot of work into a meal, but all these ingredients did nothing for one another. Odd flavor, didn't taste like chili at all. I'm thinking the bacon bits and beef boullion as well as the Worcestershire, celery and basil (along with the seasonings normally found in Italian sausage such as fennel seed) were big culprist.

This was the best chili we have ever had, bar none!  It's amazing!  For someone to post that this was no big deal with 2760 reviews making it a 5 star, well .....enough said!  You def won't be disappointed.  I will get rid of any other chili recipes I have, there really is no point in trying another.

Excellent, excellent.  Added a little more cumin, cayenne, and a chopped jalapeno (seeds removed).  Also, what the heck, used a whole bottle of guiness.  If you don't have all of the chili beans called for, kidney beans work well too!!  Thank you.  This is the only way we make chili now.

I know the ingredient list looks daunting, but it is SO worth it!! Best chili I have ever had!! I change it up to suit my tastes(no sausage, sometimes I use ground turkey, I generally never use beer because I don't have it in the house ever, and most of the time I add a can of black beans to it) but this will always be my chili recipe from now on.

I only had about two tablespoons of chili powder so that's all I used and I didn't have the bacon bits but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  We loved it.  Full of flavor and hearty.  My new chili recipe of choice.

I have made this recipe twice now... As much as i wanted it to be my "perfect" chili recipe it didn't happen. It is  a very good chili but it definitely did not stand out from other recipes i have tried. My quest continues.

OMG - can we say awesome???  I prepared this stovetop, then threw it in the crock pot to simmer.  I did make some changes, but none were drastic, just me cooking :) 
For those curious, I used dried celery flakes (i/o stalks), crushed red pepper (i/o chili peppers), and about half the onion, adding diced green onions to make up for it.  i actually cooked a whole package of thick cut bacon, diced it set aside, and used half the drippings to saute my onion, garlic and meats in, adding the bacon after i cooked the meats.  I did use deer meat in place of ground chuck, because thats what was on hand.  I added some fennel seeds too, because my sausage was a mild blend.  I did change the chili beans a bit, but just for presentation.  I used a can of pinto, light and dark kidney, and one chili bean.  I didn't add as much diced tomatoes, but next time i will.  It can handle it.  I truly think the flavors came out beautifuly.  I dont actually measure my spices, just sprinkle till I think that's about right.  So my concoction maybe a lil diff each time, but this is simple the best chili I've ever made.  Thank you soooo much for sharing!

Great recipe. I made it vegetarian by taking out all the meat products and using Boca Crumbles.

I made this for a Chili cook off at the office and won!   What a great recipe!  People especially liked all the different ingredients without it being too over the top.  I had to print off a couple copies and give them away because so many people asked for the recipe!  Thanks!

This has pretty much everything I put in my own chili.  I'm a kind of "throw everyting in the pot" kind of cook and usually don't measure anything.  I folowed this recipe exactly and I have to say.....I like it much better than my own.  I discovered I was putting waaaay too much beer and other spices in my own.  I thought the measurements of seasonings was perfect.  Really thick and meaty.  I recommend cooking it at least 2 hours (or more).   The tomatoes break down nicely and the flavors are developed.  I did add more chili powder in the end as suggested.  Makes enough for a crowd and goes together quickly.  Yum!

The problem with recipes like this is they say things like "2 green chile peppers" without telling you WHICH chili pepper. There are hundreds. It's like saying "one cup liquid" without saying which liquid!

Honestly amazing! I made a few changes... scaled the recipe back to serve 8. Excluded celery. I like alot of beans in my chili and so used a 2 cans dark kidney beans and 2 cans light kidney beans. To give the chili a nice Smokey taste I used 3 cans fire roasted diced tomatoes and 1 can hunts tomatoes sauce. There was no type of sausage or beer listed so I went with sweet Italian sausage and Sam Adams Boston Lager... The meat came out so tender and the flavor is wonderful with lots of depth. It disappeared from the table.

Great chili!  I doubled the recipe.  Doubling this recipe made two large crock pots of chili.  I cooked it yesterday, cooled overnight and re-heated today on low in the crock for dinner.  Friends raved. I have made it to the letter in the past and loved it.  This time, I substituted (for a double batch) 6 lbs. cubed sirloin instead of the ground chuck for tender, meaty servings and 3 lbs. ground turkey with Italian seasoning instead of the bulk Italian sausage (again, for a doubled volume).  I added 3-3 ounce jars of crumbled bacon to the turkey as it browned because I like the smokey flavor of the bacon.  Oh, and because of my Scandinavian family, I used only half of the chili powder (1/4 c. for a double batch).  Still spicy enough, but not over the top for these native Minnesota taste buds.  All other ingredients were included to the letter.  Served with sour cream and shredded cheddar atop and fresh sourdough bread, this made a wonderful, hearty meal.  Quite a time-intensive process, but well worth it!

THE best chili I have ever tasted. I love all the spices in this. My husband ate it Sunday (I made it for the football game), then brought it to work for lunch on Tuesday and Wednesday! :) I used ground Turkey and Turkey sausage and halved the recipe (it fed 4 of us with 2 extra large bowls left over). I left out the chili peppers and hot pepper sauce because we have kids, and it turned out wonderfully! I figured we could add those later if we needed, which we didn't. Seriously, awesome.

I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible. I didn't have chili beans, so I used black. I left out the chili peppers because I need to feed little mouths and I also used california chili powder, which gives you all the flavor of chili powder but less heat. (You can find california chili powder in the "ethnic" section of your grocery store hanging from a j-hook in a cellophane package and it costs under a dollar.) I also used brown sugar in place of the granulated, because I like a richer flavor rather than just sweet. I try to use all organic ingredients and a quality beer because the flavor and quality of what you make just turns out so much better. Those were the only changes I made. This recipe looks complicated, but it's really not. I can't tell you how wonderful it smells already. I layered all the ingredients in the crockpot so it'll be able to simmer on low most of the day. I'll update how everyone liked it later today. EDITED: This is the best chili I've ever had. Real beefy. This will replace my own recipe for chili as of today. Best chili EVER. And honestly, the longer it sits, the better it gets. Really.

There are many ingredients in this chili. Measuring them all out is a little tedious, and it would seem that the hot peppers, the cayenne, tabasco etc. would be too spicy, but in fact this chili is perfectly seasoned and delicious!!  I served it for a dinner party last night to rave reviews!  I highly recommend it!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and get amazing reiews from family and friends.  After much urging, I finally got the nerve and entered in a Chili Cook-Off yesterday.....TOOK 1st PLACE!  I made only minor changes: in place of 3-15oz cans chili beans, I used 1 large 29oz can of pink beans and 1 15 oz can light red kidnet beans, all drained and rinsed;  2 4oz cans diced green chilis instead of fresh, leave out bacon bits altogether and leave out the extra tsp of salt as there is plenty of salt throughout the recipe.

Excellent chili! I followed the recipe exact, except I didn't have Bacon Bits, so I cooked 2 strips of bacon and crumbled it. Other than that, I did exact to recipe and it was fantastic!  This makes a big pot, so I froze half of the chili for another nights dinner.

Wow, this chili was awesome!  My husband says there is something about it that is slightly "addicting" and makes him want to eat bowl after bowl.  I made it for the Superbowl, but we were so full from snacks that we didn't eat it until the next day, which I think made the chili even better!  A couple of things I changed just due to availability of items:  I used one 28 oz. can kidney beans and one 28 oz. can of pinto beans.  I also used Anaheim chili peppers because green chiles weren't available and I cut down the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. because my 15 month old was going to be eating it and I didn't want it overly spicy.  I think these were minor changes and stayed true to the original recipe, which made a fantastic pot of chili!

This was absolutely awesome!!!  Loved it, and it made a big batch.  It was just a bit spicy for me (and I even left out the 2 green chili peppers), so next time I will cut the hot pepper sauce back by one teaspoon.  Be sure to serve with the Fritos and shredded cheddar cheese -- really makes it "pop!" Don't know why anyone would say this recipe is "bland" or is just an "ok" chili recipe -- must be an IU fan.  Go Boilers!

I made for Super Bowl 45.  The chili was a real crowd pleaser.  It was a bit too thick for my personal liking and is quite mild in terms of spice.  Nevertheless, it is a very solid "standard" chili.

Great chili! Very tasty & hearty. Probably one of the best recipes for chili I have used yet. I did however make a few changes & substitutions, the biggest was adding beef stock and brown sugar, but it is all about personal taste. Its great on top of hot dogs! You won't be sorry-try it!

Best chili ever!! I don't drain any of the chili beans and 3 cans of the chili beans from Aldi work great with 1 can of Bush's chili beans in hot sauce. I use a can of diced green chiles instead of seeding and chopping 2 green chile peppers. I add more like 3 or 4 tablespoons of bacon bits and almost a whole bottle of beer. I also use a vidalia onion because that is all that I buy. Thanks for the post!!

LOVEDDD this recipe!! I tweaked the recipe just a bit - I did not add bacon bits.  I also did not use 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I only used one and also used a 28oz can of tomato puree to loosen up the chili.  It was perfect after simmering for 2 hours.  This will be my "go to" chili for now on.

I have made this Chili four times now and everyone that has tried it absolutely loves it. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. I added Linguica and cut back on beef and that was a welcome addition. Next is Spicy Chorizo. Let you know how that works! Another hint is while you have the spices out is to make individual spice packets with all the dry ingredients. This way you just add the packet the next time you make the chili and it will significantly cut down on the prep time.

I have to say this was delicious. I think I was a bit too generous on the spices, and it ended up being quite hot, but I still loved it. Good thing is, it freezes pretty well, so none of it went to waste.

Thanks for the recipe

Original thought...a can of beer in chili - EWWW! But I made it anyway. Man, am I glad I did. YUMMM!! I love chili and have tried many different recipes. This is one of the best. I've made it a handful of times and it's great each time. This makes a TON of chili. I freeze leftovers and it's still delish. I hardly ever review recipes - but had to add my review. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great base recipe. I modified it, substituting chicken jalapeno sausage, adding two dried habaneros, one pequino pepper, and half of a ghost chili for a really nice balance of spice and heat. I used a full beer and added broccoli and zucchini. Hard to put it down.

Tried the recipe but removed the chopped celery and used celery powder instead, added 4 garlic cloves, used Brown Sugare instead of white and used 1/2 Red Chili Beans, 1/2 Pink Cannelli beans and got rave reviews.  The Chili comes out a "Mildly Hot" but is really flavorful and all the vegetables gives it a sweeter taste than most chilis.  I always like to look at a few different recipes and add ingredients to suit my and my family's tastes.  Give it a try, it's delightful!

This Chili is AMAZING! It spicy and delicous! And so easy to make! We have been making it for years for all sorts of gatherings, from cold winter nights to Superbowl! It freezes great too! We have added our own little touches to it to make it more unique for us! I would recommend this chili to anyone!

I made this for the first time for a camping trip and it was gone in 15 minutes.  I follow the ingredients exactly, but just put everything into a crock pot and put on low for awhile.  Be careful because if your crock pot is filled to the top, it may overflow after a couple hours because the longer it cooks, the more juice it produces.  The first time I came back after 4 hours, the juice was ALL over my kitchen floor.

Got to say I expected spectacular based on all the hits and reviews....turned out to be a thicker chili that didn't impress the man of the house.  Nice mix of seasonings but won't be a go-to recipe.

Not an "oh-my-word-this-is-the-best-chili-I've-ever-had" chili, but a solid recipe.  I lessened the amount of hot spices I put in, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Good flavor. Very hearty.  Reheats well.  Makes a pretty big batch.  We'll make it again sometime to freeze for several dinners for the two of us to have in the future.

This chili was pretty good, but I didn't win my chili cook-off with it.  It was beefy and spicy, but otherwise didn't really have any special pizazz.  I did make a few changes: 1) used 4 slices bacon, fried & crumbled. 2) sauteed the onions, peppers and garlic in the bacon grease 3) used 2 cloves fresh garlic.  4) omitted the celery and substituted 1 can of chopped green chilis for the green chili pepper, 5) used a whole can of beer, and 6) cut the tabasco and cayenne pepper in half--it was still spicey enough.  After browning the meat and sauteeing the vegetables, I threw everything in my large crock pot (which was completely filled) and cooked on low for 8 hours, then refrigerated overnight and warmed up again the next day.  Being a Boilermaker, I had high hopes for this recipe, and while it was good, it's not the BEST chili I've ever had.

BEST chili I've ever made! This recipe is great; lots of meaty flavors and great spices.  Also, being a Boilermaker myself, I am partial.  Kids don't love it too hot, so I take it easy on the pepper and hot sauce, but we add it to taste when we serve it.  Great game day chili.  Also, we don't do pork, but its great even without it.

Basically followed the recipe, but toned down all the heat...and it was still plenty hot and spicy. Omitted the "spicy" can of chili beans. Added an extra can of regular chili beans instead. Instead of two green chili peppers, I only added @1/2 of one green chili pepper. (Pasilla Chili pepper) Other reductions: 2 Tbsp of chili powder, 1 tsp Tabasco, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. If you are concerned at all about this chili being too spicy, follow the reductions that I am suggesting. The quality of this chili is amazing...just figure out how spicy you want it and you can't miss!!

Made this on Saturday to have for Super Bowl Sunday. My husband couldn't wait & had a big bowl of it Saturday. His words, 'WOW, IS THIS GOOD!" How can you beat that? I followed the recipe to a T but cut it in half & it filled my 6 qt slow cooker. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

DO NOT CHANGE A THING ABOUT THIS RECIPE!!!  I read reviews on this site all the time and people give recipes high ratings but then they talk about how they changed it up.  This one is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT the way it is!!!  I have been looking for an awesome chili recipe for quite some time now and finally found one.  I made this for a group of friends and it got rave reviews and still does everytime I make it.  It keeps well to, after a couple days in the fridge it does soak up the liquid so simply add a bit of water and a couple beef bouillion cubes and its even better than when you first made it!  

Make it exactly how it says above and you won't be dissapointed

I thought this was a really good chili, I took it to a baby shower and got a ton of compliments. I made a few changes to it though, I only used 3 cans of beans and substituted one of those with Kidney beans. I also didn't use Tabasco, instead I put in one minced habenaro and one minced jalapeno pepper. It added a nice flavor to it and some spice. Next time I might add another jalapeno to make it a little spicier since i love spicy things.

Yes, it really is as good as they say. Best chili I ever made. I used chicken broth in place of the beer and 1 can of chili beans and 3 cans of kidney beans. I added the chili beans right away and the kidney beans after the chili had simmered for about an hour so the wouldn't over cook.

This was an awesome chili!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for EXCEPT we didn't have any beer so I left that out.  As well, my husband isn't a fan of beans so instead of 4 cans of chili beans I used 1 can of red kidney beans and 1 can of chick peas.  It was great!

Love it. The only change I make usually is real bacon instead of bacon bits. I brown the meat in the grease and leave it in. I usually use two serrano peppers and one jalapeno, both seeded. I'm going to try this recipe with cubed chuck steak today, as a previous reviewer recommended. Either way, this is a great recipe to start from and modify to your own tastes. I've made it 4+ times and every time someone has told me it's the best chili they've tasted.

Oh my, what a meal... Cut down on spiciness, other than that - made as written. Hubby offered to enter in the next chili cook-off. It was that good. We thought 2 ingredients make this recipe: bacon and Italian sausage. Outstanding.

We loved this recipe, however we thought it was too meaty and needed more sauce with the amount of meat.  We added an extra can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce.  We thought it needed more tomato and liquid.  It ended up being wonderful but because I couldn't just follow the recipe I give it a 4.

Well, I'm going to add my 5 stars to the 413 other reviews.  This chili was great! I cut the recipe in half except for the tomato paste, and since it looked too thick, I added a can of beef broth.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  My daughter and husband were sneaking spoonfuls of this chili right from the pan while it was cooking.  I'm lucky there was any left to serve for dinner.  Definately a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loves this recipe! It has now been requested for dinner on my daughters 13th b.day. The only thing I did different was (I have picky eaters) I took all the veggies it required and put them in a blender and then added it to the pot. I don't mind the chunks but my kids do. It tasted great just the same and I didn't have to watch my kids picking at their food. I also made fries and velveta cheese and with the leftovers had chili cheese fries. Omg it was amazing!

I made this recipe with a few additions of my own and 3 subtractions. I WON FIRST place in a regional Chili Cook-off. With a 12 judge panel. With a cash prise, award certificate and Ribbon and my name in the news paper..  ..  :)

I made this chili this morning for an office luncheon and only made a minor change...  I made my chili using venison burger and venison breakfast sausage.  I expanded the recipe slightly to allow for making a larger quantity.  The principle difference when using venison, you can disregard the need to drain off excess grease.  There is none.  Other than that, I made no changes and it turned our great.  Thanks.

Way too salty! Does not need the 1 teaspoon of salt if you are going to put 4 beef bullion in there. I honestly am only going to put 2 in next time. I had to water down this recipe b/c a) it had so much salt and b) it had so much spice that it was NOT enjoyable. We love spicy spicy foods but this physically hurt. 1/4 cup chili powder? NOT NECESSARY. 1 tablespoon is good or do it to taste, otherwise you have a huge batch of chili you don't enjoy. Remember there is also a lot of other spice in there. I would give it 5 stars with my alterations.

Not bad.  It is spicy, and I cut back on the cayenne, but not the hot sauce.  This makes a ton--I halved it and still filled up our biggest crockpot, so keep that in mind.  It's a good thing we liked it or we'd have a problem!  I used canned green chiles (all I had) and used a full bottle of beer.  I also didn't find spicy chili beans so just used regular.  I have to say, though, that I'm not sure the point of buying chili beans for this recipe if they are just going to be drained.  Chili beans are just pinto beans with water, tomato paste and seasonings, so I left them undrained.  This recipe calls for a ton of ingredients, so it is a bit daunting, but I would think most people have most of the spices in their cupboards and might just have to get a few things to round out the recipe.  Plus, if you don't like spicy at all leave out the hot sauce and cayenne.  I popped this in the crockpot overnight, cooked it for 10 hours on low, then reheated it today for lunch.  Worked wonderfully so I didn't have to keep it on the stove for a while.  Thanks for the recipe!

Being an alumnus of Purdue, I was certain that ANYTHING with Boilermaker in the title would be good.  And this chili was Awesome!  I will definitely make again. My husband said it was his favorite chili ever.    :0)----------11-18-11 I have made this numerous times now, and everytime I realize that this is the best chili I've had. (Mom, I hope you aren't reading this!  Yours is good too!)-------

This will be THE chili recipe for us.  We went to a couple of chili cook off before and also tried a few recipes but this is the best.  Omitted the beans and double the cayenne.  We just don't like beans in our chili and hubby likes his chili spicy.  At first I thought...what a long list of ingredients...but it's worth it. Bursting with flavor. Love it! Made it 2 weeks ago, will make again this weekend.

This Chili is the best I have ever made! It was so delicious. I split the recipe in half because I have a smaller crock pot but it turned out awesome. My husband doesnt eat alot at once but he ate the entire pot of chili minus the one bowl I was able to get out of it. 

I WILL DEFINITLEY MAKE THIS AGAIN! 
Spicy but not too hot. AMAZING!

I have made this chili several times. Changing it slightly every time...........Stick to the base recipe and you'll never fail. I add a whole bag of fresh bacon bits (well as fresh as they can be with out making them yourself). 2 habaneros, 1 jalapeno, Double up on the worcestershire, and Leave the hot sauce out. The recipe is fantastic as is though! Enjoy!! PS....... VERY IMPORTANT: My batch serves 12. Habaneros/jalapeno accordingly! :-)

Great recipe!  I changed up the recipe a bit.  I used 4 garlic cloves. I left out the fritos.  Instead I served my chili with double broiled cheese bread.  My Guests commented that it was the best chili they have ever had!

This chili is very good. My uncle makes chili that is well known all over Texas, and this chili kicks his chili's butt! I only used one pepper because I had some guests who don't do spicy. It was wonderful.

Absolutly amazing! Best chili I've ever had. Made a few changes to suit my family. Omitted diced tomatoes, onion, celery, and all peppers, substituted with rotel for chili and tomato juice. Still taste great and makes it a little easier.

Amazing chili.  I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  The recipe makes a lot, but easy to freeze for future dinners.  The sausage adds great flavor.

I used sweet italian link sausage that I brownd and stew meat, that I browned as well. That was the only difference that i made to the recipe. Everyone who tasted said it was very good and seasoned perfectly.

AWESOME! Great combo of flavors. Made this hot steaming pot on a snow day in with all my roommates. didn't have beef bouillon so used 1 cube of chicken bouillon and added salt (pretty much what bouillon is). Also didn't add bacon - forgot it. But it was fantastic, nice and spicy. The fritos were nice touch.

Great recipe!  I used just about all the ingredients expect for beef and pork. I substituted ground turkey and I used mini turkey pepperoni, also I didn't have diced tomatos or tomato paste and I didn't drain the beans. I used ketsup & honey BBQ sauce and instead of beer I used chicken broth. My family loved it!

Very good! Used ground turkey instead of beef and sweet itailan sausage. Used a whole bottle of beer and added 1cup water cause it was very thick. Extremely easy to make; just alot of chopping&ingredients but well worth it!!

Great chili recipe, It was my first time making it and we took it to a chili cook off at a friends house, there was 8 entries and mine won best over all and best on a hot dog. I did doctor it up a bit, just a little extra chili powder, paprika, hot sauce, and cumin. added extra ground beef and peppers, and 2 extra chili peppers. Next time I make it I'm going to put half Italian sausage and half ground beef and extra bacon. Oh that's right I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and used 3 cans of beans instead of 4. Great stuff.

This recipe was GREAT. My husband said it was the best chili he had ever had. If you don't like beans like we don't this chili can stand alone without it. Like another reviewer said this chili is quite spicy. My husband who loves spicy anything was glad I made it less spicy. Since we didn't use beans we omitted the spicy sauce and we also didn't use the pepper sauce. It still had plenty of kick. We also put this in the crockpot for 4 hrs on high. So Good! Give it a try!

Followed the advice of Nhi and used 3 tbsp bacon bits, but should have used 2 at most.  Also followed other advice therein with a few modifications.  Smelled wonderful when cooking, but lost too much tomato flavor.  Next time, will use less chili powder and cumin and add a can of tomato sauce (which I did this time after the first serving).

Chili is something that is very subjective, I guess. This one has a lot of good ratings, but as for me, I'm still looking for that perfect chili recipe. This one wasn't it.

Loved the recipe except one small glitch. My chili actually started fermenting the next day. Could this have been from the type of beer I used?!? I'm actually a little reluctant to try again using beer!

Arrrgh - This recipe be "Pirate Approved."  Me and me mates prefer to leave out the chili and both the red and green bell peppers (prevents me crew from getting seasick), but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

This is a great chili and I definitely recommend giving it a try. I love the addition of sausage and beer. Next time I may try adding crumbled bacon strips instead of bacon bits just to give it that extra boost. Don't be intimidated by the ingredient list, because you will probably already have most of the ingredients in your pantry. I didn't add the cayenne pepper because it had a nice kick without it.

I just put a big pot of this in the fridge for my dad's 74th birthday celebration tomorrow.  I believe chili needs to be made one day and eaten the next as it's always better reheated.  But, this stuff is OMG delicious!  I have some "wimpy" family members so I did not add the chile peppers and I used beans in mild and medium sauce not spicy.  I also left out the bell peppers and celery just because we don't care for that in chili.  But, I do believe the beer and the sausage is what really makes this so good! That and the bacon. Yummy! Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

I loved this recipe and so did those who ate it.  I made a couple of preparation step changes.  First, I addedd salt and pepper to the ground beef and sausage when I was browning it.  If you don't, you'll have a hard time getting it properly seasoned.  Second, I waited to add the beans and tomatoes until after the vegetables.  I sauteed the vegetables and spices in the some of the meat drippings, waited for them to soften, then added the beans, tomatoes and beer.  This layers the flavors better.

Changes - my husband didn't want it too spicy - only 3 cans of beans, no celery, 2 T chili powder, no hot sauce, 1/2 t cayenne, used 3 pieces of chopped bacon.  I put 3/4 c of beer, but next time I would do 1/2 c because the chili was overall a little soupy.  It could be because I used the food processor to chop the onions and peppers and that turned out a little watery.

This is a really good recipe.  I've made it a few times and folks always love it.  Of course like many others, I've won a chili cook-off with a variation on this recipe and will continue to use it in the future.  A couple of things I always change on this recipe is: Add 1 tbsp ground coriander to brighten the flavor, Use extra bacon (about 3x the recommended amount, leave out the celery, and add about 30% more tomato in the form of additional diced tomato or crushed tomato with puree.  I've also made this recipe vegetarian by omitting the meat and beef bouillon and adding italian seasoning, vegetable bouillon, 50% more beans (and diversifying the types), a little more sugar to cut the tartness of the tomatoes, and 1 cup of bulgar wheat toward the end for heartiness.  The result is a very good vegetarian (maybe even vegan?) chili.

In the process of making this, I was thinking..."come on, this seems like overkill on the ingredients".  Just do it.  Just make this recipe.  Cut it in half or 1/4 if you're only cooking for a few.  It takes awhile to make and clean up....but it's been simmering for 4 hours, I tasted it, and it's honestly the best chili I've ever tried without question.  Even though the boilermakers are no good, their chili is amazing.  Even if you think you're an "expert", just try the recipe as is without making adjustments.  Now I'm pumped for some college football!

FIRST TIME REVIEWER AND FIRST TIME FOLLOWING A RECIPE EXACTLY!! This was OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD!! Wish there was 100 stars to give it. I have tried every chili recipe under the sun and finally my hunt is over...there is not ONE thing to change with this recipe. It is the best tasting chili I have ever tried and so says my husband! I cut the recipe in half, it fed the two of us with seconds for dinner, and equal portion saved for tomorrow! I did "enhance" the diced tomatoes...I bought the authentic spanish ones from the international section of the grocery store, with the green chili's already in it. Follow the recipe to the last drop, and you've got yourself AN AWARD WINNING CHILI!!

Great recipe. I did modify it for my lack of eating beef (used 95% lean ground turkey and hot turkey Italian sausage). Also tried different kinds of beans (1 can light kidney, 1 can dark kidney, 1 can white, 1 can chili in chili sauce) just to get some color variation in there. I've also played around with different kinds of bell peppers, again just for color, as well as using Italian diced tomatoes to add even more flavor. Try some Sriracha instead of regular hot sauce, adds a different kind of kick to it! Using the turkey modification, it also cuts the calories down to about 340/serving (before chips/sour cream/cheese), so it's a healthier option. But great base recipe!

I guess this was okay but a huge list of ingredients for about the same results I get from half as many. I wish I could say I was blown away but I was not. Too much effort for little gain.

Okay, MEAN girls out there.  I made it exactly and we were not crazy about it.  I think, like other dishes, we get used to our favorite flavors in chili, stuffing, potato salad, etc.  It's all subjective to what you're used to.  For a first time chili maker, I'm sure it was wonderful.  I've been making variations for 45 years and prefer mine.  Be NICE even if you didn't like a recipe.

I can't have beans so I subbed 1/2 can chiptole peppers in adobe sauce for the beans. I also didn't add the beer or beef broth (couldn't find any that were wheat/gluten-free). I fried 4 pieces of thick smoked bacon (no bacon bits here) and I only have smoked paprika. 

I know. Changes, blah, blah...... When you can't have certain foods you have to make changes. Hopefully anyone else that is gluten-free/SCD/primal/paleo diet can find these changes useful. :)

Best chili I have ever made/tasted ever! My adjustments (due to either lack of or personal preference): 2 pounds ground pork, 1 pound regular sausage (like breakfast sausage) 2 cans kidney beans, drained; 2 cans pinto beans, one drained, one not; next six items on list I left alone; I took out the green chili peppers, because I didn't have any and used real bacon, four pieces, and sauted the bell peppers, celery and onion in its grease; replaced beef bouillon with equal amount beef broth base powder; remaining 13 items, kept as is; and garnished with crackers instead of Frito's and the cheese, in each individual serving, and sour cream, if wanted.... best, once again, I ever tasted or made. Sorry if I can't help you out on the rating because of so many changes, but this was seriously awesome. I didn't expect it. I think all the pork products, all the spices, and the sauted veggies is what really make it. This is probably definitely my forever chili!!!!

Alright, I tried this based on high reviews, and was simply not worth the hype. Chili should have great flavors, and when you bite into a bowl of red, you expect a certain something. Tasted like Wolf's Brand, had no spice, and frankly, had too many ingredients to be authentic. Pretty disappointing. I'm sorry, fella, but this shouldn't be in the top 20 recipes.

Seriously! Unreal :D I am not even a chili fan but this is wonderful! I took the advice of another review and used another pound of chuck so it would be extra meaty, I subtracted a can of beans because I don't like beans and it's perfect! I also replaced a can of diced tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis so that I wouldn't have to chop any up. There are a ton of ingredients but it's so worth it. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

This recipe has a really good seasoned flavor. It takes awhile to make because there are so many seasonings but it's what makes it good. The only thing I'm not sure about is the Italian sausage. Italian sausage is not something I normally cook with and I got the reduced fat turkey sausage hot (nutritional facts suggest reduced fat) and the sausage was really chewy and the skin of the sausage is hard to choose. So i would just stick with beef or choose a different kind of sausage than what I used. I used lean beef and that was fine.

Fantastic chili!! Anyone who doesn't like this recipe must be doing something wrong! I changed a few things-only added 1 can of beans, about 2 lbs of chopped sirloin, 2 lbs of ground hamburger, lb sausage and about a lb of bacon. Browned all meat before adding it to pot. Also didn't measure any of the spices, just threw 'em all in. Also added a can of pureed pineapple to tone down the spice. Tasted much better the next day after the flavors had time to sit. This chili is time consuming and not cheap, so if you're on the hunt for quick/inexpensive, this is not for you. 
We ate this for days, so tasty!!! Served with fritos and LOTS of cheese :)

Was good but a lot more involved than my regular chili recipe which a lot of people like.  I generally use kidney beans but did like the chili beans so I may try that w/my regular recipe, glad I tried them.  If I make again I will probably knock out at least 1/2 the spices, 12? I normally cook the veggies w/the meat, I didn't this time and it took hours for the bell peppers to soften up, had to take it out of the crock pot and put it in a cast iron dutch oven to get them soft. Made a lot (5 or 6 quarts) so at least we'll get several meals out of it. I felt like a witch concocting some elaborate potion over a cauldron w/all the ingredients LOL! Pack a lunch if your making this, I did enjoy it, thanks!

This is very good..I didn't use all the ingredients. Instead of caned beans I used dry pinto beans.  I also substituted the diced tomato's for tomato sauce.  I added 1/2 lb of bacon 1/2 lb spicy sausage instead of the 1 lb of Italian sausage. Used 2 full beers and 1 tsp. of curry.. I kept everything else the same.  This Is the best chili I have made yet.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow this was a great chili recipe.  We tried to make it exactly as written, but due to the size of the crock pot, we had to omit half the tomatoes.  To compensate for the loss of fluid from the tomatoes, we doubled the beer (Guinness).  Also, I would have drained the grease from the meat but was outvoted.  What is chili for, if not for ingesting large amounts of grease?  The whole thing was incredibly delicious.

It was great. Almost tasted identical to Wendy's chili though... Next time I will definitely add more hot sauce.

OHHHH MYYYY GOD!! Thats all I can say about this recipe, VERY hearty! I made this for a shift dinner for my employees at work. They all ranted and raved, and I had to print out  40 of these recipes. 
I didn't use quite as much diced tomatoes(one 28 oz. petite diced and one 14.5 oz Chili ready tomatoes with juices. I used regular ground pork sausage and seasoned with Italian seasoning. I used one 16 oz can of pinto chili beansin in mild sauce. I Left out the green Chile peppers. I used 1/2 bottle of bud light beer, and not as much Chili Powder, keeping the recipe semi tame, yet enough to make your nose run. I would rate this recipe 10 stars if I could!

This chili was really good. But REALLY spicy!! My husband and I both love spicy food, but this one was a lot hotter than I like. The flavor was great though. I will definitely make it again, but will probably skip out on the tobasco sauce and use half the amount of cayanne pepper.

Good, solid chili recipe to base off of, personally I use black beans instead of pinto or kidney, not only are they more flavorful, but also more nutritious. I also like a more tomato based chili, so I tend to use more tomato paste (also thickens it up more...I don't like chili with liquid). I have seen a few reviews which ppl say they are a bit disappointed, I have one thing to say...

ANY 'stewing' recipe like this with so many flavors takes several hours to slow cook, PLUS refrigeration overnight for the flavors to really blend and come to their full potential.

When I made this recipe, I chose to use some shiraz (a dry red wine) instead of the beer, did out iwth the sugar, and added a spice in a few different flavors...using different types of spice gives it more dimension (for example, I left some of the jalapeno seeds in, added some red pepper flakes, used some cayenne and also sirracha (asian type of hot sauce) all in small amounts. I also used a it of ground mustard, and went for variety on peppers (jalapeno, anaheim, green bell, red bell and yellow bell) lastly, I prefer bermuda onions in this type of a dish. 

Okay, so I have changed it a bit, but it really is a solid recipe to start wit to suit your own personal taste, style and sensibilities

With all the great reviews, I thought this could compare with chili made with ham on the bone. It was not as good though. I did give it 4 stars, but it really should be around 3.5. I made a few changes. First, I omitted the Tabasco sauce and added 1 habanero pepper. I couldn't find spicy chili beans so I used 2 cans of regular. I also let it simmer for about an hour or so longer than it says to, just because I wanted all the flavors to stand out. The reason I didn't love this chili was because it was not thick enough. If I made this recipe again I will try draining some of the liquid from the tomatoes. I also think the chili would be better with meet chunks added instead of all ground meet. Overall, good but not the great "home cooked" goodness I was looking for.

My BF loves this recipe.  This is a nice thick Chili.  I think next time I make it, I will cut down on beans by 1 can and add 1 additional can of tomatoes and 1 additional can of tomato paste.

A very good chili.  I usually put hot sauce in my chili to add flavor but I don't need to with this one.  Quite tasty.  Next time I make it, though, I'd probably cut the recipe in half.  The was this is written it made a TON!

This chili was good. I did change up a few things. It was not spicy at all despite my using about 6 cored and seeded jalapenos. So I added 1 more tbl of hot sauce and about 1 tbl of red pepper flakes and more cayenne. Even with all this there  was just barely a kick. I also added slivered garlic and about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. Yes, sounds strange, but adds just a hint of that *something*. 
Also took out on of the cans of chili beans and subbed in a can of white beans that were mashed - helps add some thickness to the texture. Definitely a good recipe and I will make it with these changes again!

I have been using this recipe with only one modification for years now (Luisanana hot sausage instead of Italian). I have on several occasions been asked to make a double batch, around 14 quarts, and have never brought any back with me.

MLM22 appears to be page trolling, as they have no clue what they are talking about. Just because something has the word "Texas" in it, does not make it good.

Enjoy making this chili and enjoy the compliments you get when people eat it.

I made this chili for superbowl Sunday and everyone thought it was good.  I cooked it longer than the original recipe as was mentioned to bring out the flavors as others have suggested.  I served it with cornbread and fixins' for the top such as onion, cheese and sour cream.  I will try again, but add some additional tomatoes since I like my chili with more of a tomato base. I will also use kidney beans next time in lieu of the chili beans. Overall, it was pretty good. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW. YUM! I followed this recipe pretty much to a t. The only thing I didn't have was dried parsley, and instead of Tabasco, I added a chipotle hot sauce that gave it a little bit of a smoky kick. At first I was a little overwhelmed by the ingredient list, but soon after realized I had about half the ingredients in my pantry/fridge already. This chili has a great meat/veggie to liquid ratio and is the most flavorful chili I've tasted. The only thing I might do differently next time is ad a tad more hot sauce (I like spicy).

I made this for super bowl Sunday, and it was a big hit, I made it leaner by cutting the meat back to 1# of ground beef, and 1/2# of Italian sausage. I also added 2T of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for a smoky heat, and cut the chili powder back to 1 T. I used kidney, black, and chili beans. I made it the day before the game , and reheated in a big crockpot. It was a little thick, so I added two small cans of tomato juice to thin..I also omitted the green chiles and the bacon, did'nt miss them at all.Instead of bouillon, which is loaded with salt, I added a can of campbells french onion soup.We topped it with diced white onion, shredded cheddar, sour cream and fritos..Awesome!

Great recipe ! awesome chili ! I am a beer lover and used Two Brothers brewing co.'s Hop Juice which is a double IPA 9.9% alc vol. and victory's brewing co.'s Yakima Glory which is a black IPA 8.7%. also added corn, black beans, an extra can of dark kidney beans, and some extra tabasco sauce. This was my first made chili i've ever made.. i was inspired by a chili cook off i went to in nyc yesterday but got there late and didn't get to try any of the 13 persons batches. This chili came out great and i'll have leftovers all week !

This is a decent recipe. It's spicy and has good flavor. The prep is a little heavy but if you organize yourself it can be done in little time. You even get to drink the leftover beer. I heated it all up and tossed it in the crock pot for a couple hours. I tweaked it a little bit with the spices, and I omitted the bacon bits since it didn't seem to add much the first time I made this. The next day I gave the chili (mostly the beans) a quick chop, heated, and served on nacho chips with salsa, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. Great with hot dogs too, so don't throw out leftovers!

Don't know how anyone could call this disappointing...I've been making it for 6 years now and it is to die for...especially as leftovers...last time we made it we ate ours every night for a week and did not get tired of it (that's saying something for me).

Changes that helped:
-You pretty much always need more beer...add to taste and make sure its a strong beer. I usually end up using a full cup
-Its never very spicy prepared as directed...but I never use chili beans in spicy sauce (can't find) but it tastes delish when you use about one chopped jalapeno (instead of 2 green chlis) and about 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (in can) this gives it a smoky chipotle like flavor...
-mix the types o beans...we often use both kideny and white beans....makes it prettier (and tastier I think) 
-I usually don't bother with bacon bits and it doesn't need them...its such a complex tasting chili as it is!!
-Don't waste this by putting it on fritos...but do get an AMAZING VERY SHARP cheddar to put on top...compliments it amazingly...
-Make sure you season to taste...I always add a little bit more salt, pepper or sugar etc to get the perfect balance...trust your taste buds but also know that after 1 day in the fridge the flavors will meld and be much much better than the day you made it...

You can also make this with ground turkey and turkey sausage which tastes the same to me and is healthier!

Serve this with Cornbread, beer and sharp sharp cheddar...it's TO DIE FOR...

Made this on superbowl day and my husband was a huge fan. I, on the other hand, didn't care for it quite as much. I thought the Italian sausage gave it a different taste than I was expecting. I was overall disappointed after cooking it in a crockpot all day....I was soooo looking forward to finding the perfect chili recipe :(

I was disappointed with this recipe. It's not that it wasn't good...it's just that it was ordinary. This chili did not live up to the ratings or the amount of times it's been looked at. If you are looking for the best chili recipe ever, pass on this one. Don't get me wrong, it was good. I've had better though.

I loved this chili even though it has a lot of ingredients!  I thought it was wonderful, did not add the pepper seeds because I am a wimp and skipped the Tabasco - still had a little kick but mild for chickens like me.  Also held out one can of chili beans because I like mine more meaty than beany.  Won a friend's chilifest with this recipe against 7 other very good competitors!

Authentic or not, very good and spicy chili.  For kids and myself, I used sour cream to tone down and it was really good.  My husband loved it spicy the way it was.  I will definitely make it again.

This is so delicious! I couldn't find Italian sausage so I used jalapeno sausage and canned green chilies. It is so delicious!!!!! It is a ton though. So I freeze at least to more dinners worth of it for me and my husband. Definitely a keeper for a spicy lover.

The boys loved this chili! I did make some changes by increasing the bacon to 1 cup and using real bacon. I made it the night before and reheated it in a crock pot for the big game. It was a big hit!

Great recipe even though I changed it by: using the meat of sweet italian sausage; replacing all beans with 2 cans black and 1 red kidney; omitting chili peppers, bacon and used vegetable bouillon; added 2 tsp coriander. It's been a hit since then!

I was a little dissapointed with this recipe as I was expecting something that was "out of this world"!!  While it definitely is a very good chili recipe, I wasn't completely wowed.  I think the problem is that my own chili recipe is very similar and we love it!  This wasn't a bad recipe by any means but just so similar to our own.  For sure if you have never made chili or just have a so so recipe, you'll love this!  It IS good chili.

This is one of the best recipes for chili I've tasted. Will definitely use this one in the future. I did substitute tomato sauce (3 cans 30 total oz) instead of the diced tomatoes as my kids prefer this.

My whole family absolutely LOVED this recipe! I only use two cans of beans because we aren"t the biggest fans of them, and I leave out the bacon bits- other than that I follow the recipe exactly! I've made this about 5 times now and it is a requested dinner regularly! Thanks for posting!

This was quite different from my "regular" chili, but the family loved it.  I'm not a fan of sausage, so I was hesitant to make this but was pleasantly surprised when I couldn't taste the "sausagy" taste that I dislike.  I took leftovers to work the next day and they were gobbled up quickly!  I served with Fritos, cheddar cheese and sour cream as toppings.  Will make again and agai I'm sure!

this was a great recipe.  A few tweaks that knocked it out of the park for us:  use dark beer, bock style. Like several reviewers, i added more chopped bacon, but used smoked/cured bacon which gave the chili a complex, smoky taste.  We used a mix of sweet red peppers, anaheim peppers and fresh jalapenos, which added both hot and sweet flavors.  We  added half a bottle of beer and drank the rest, and added some red wine and leftover coffee, and molasses instead of sugar. Finally, i added some epizote, a natural herb that cuts down on gas from bean dishes.

If I could give this TEN stars - I would!!!  NOT kidding!! My husband LOVES this chili - and boy is he normally picky about his chili!!  I gotta tell you though - each time I make this, it is different.  It always depends on the hot peppers that we get from the fresh produce - depending on what is in stock at that time of the year.  Took some of the suggestions and here is what we did: we followed most of the recipe to a T - with the exception of:  ~we used a lb of spicy Italian sausage and 1 lb of ground beef (if you want it EXTRA meaty like my husband does - you can do sp.it sausage, gr beef AND beef chuck! - of course all three means more expensive) ~the only chili beans at our grocery store were mild - so we get 3 mild and one texan style - the only other variation.   ~Chili peppers are different each time ~instead of oregano and basil - we just use a italian seasoning spice/mix ~we cook the bacon first, leaving all the fat in and then sautee the veggies in the bacon fat ~to reduce the amount of liquid - we drain one can of the diced tomatoes and one can of the mild chili beans ~we also simmer for 2 1/2 hours on the stove and then the next day I put it in the crock pot for about 5-6 hours.  (THIS makes a huge difference!!)  The best thing about this chili is that it gets BETTER AND BETTER each day that passes!!    A little pricey but Huge Hit and makes a LARGE amount so it's worth it!!!

I've never been a huge fan of chili, but this recipe is by far the best I've ever tasted! I halved the recipe, otherwise followed it to the letter. Oh, with a little extra beer. This is great for the cooler weather!

can't understand the rave reviews? this is regular old chili, and when made exactly by the recipe, the heat overpowers all those other flavors. don't get me wrong, i believe chili should be good & spicy, but there's not much point in adding the celery, peppers, bacon, bouillon, beer, worcestershire, garlic, oregano, & basil if you're going to follow this recipe to the T. this chili was good, but not as good as I expected.

As an accomplished cook, I have used this website many times as a recipe resource and many times it has rewarded me.  No recipe however has compelled me to comment.  I was looking for a chili recipe for a Super Bowl party and happened upon this.  950+ raving about it, it has to be good, right?  Well, try beyond good!  The BEST chili I have ever had.  Like others, I used real bacon and sauteed the vegetables in the drippings.  I also used Red Stripe...12 oz, Mexican Oregano and New Mexico Chili Powder.  I can only imagine what this will taste like after it sets overnight.

This was good chili.  But for spending almost $50 on all of the ingrediants and the preparation time I expected spectacular chili.  My husband wasn't impressed at all with the taste but he was in awe that I managed to spend so much money on a run of the mill tasting chili.

My husband and I both think this is the best chili we have ever eaten.  Next time I will add the entire bottle of beer and we used a slow cooker and it definately helped cook everthing down.  Warning this chili is very spicy!

I made this for a tailgate and it was AWESOME.  I omitted the celery and crumbled real bacon rather than using bacon bits.  I didn't add the tabasco sauce because we didn't have any on hand but it was still pretty spicy.  I used spicy italian sausage so that probably made up for it.  Warning--this makes ALOT of chili.  Definitely more than 10 servings.

Very good chili.  I slow cooked on stove for several hours.  I used 1/2 lb. bacon instead of bacon bits; would probably reduce salt next time.  Also, to reduce heat I omitted cayenne, surprised no one else mentionned doing that.  Was still medium hot even with no cayenne, 1/2 of chili peppers (I used jalapenos), 1/2 of chili powder and 1/2 of hot pepper sauce.  I made a double batch for 20.  Need 12 quart stock pot for that much in case anyone else was wondering.  Probably only made 8 quarts but it would spill over in 8 qt. stock pot.  Served with hot dogs and all the accoutrements to 15-18 high school construction guys and had plenty leftover.  Also for beans I used 1 can medium hot chili beans, 1 can plain chili beans, 2 cans dark red kidney, 1 can light red kidney, 1 can pinto.  Will definitely make again, will probably add 1/2 of cayenne next time.

We have a big party once a year called Smittyfest.  I made a big pot of Chili the last two years and it's never just the right mixture.  So I turned to this website for some help and viola.  I served over 100 people this chili and there was not one complaint.  Not only that but I followed the recipe to a tee and it was perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe to all.  It has the right combination of chili flavors to serve on a cool autumn day!

This was awsome and easy to make to :) I squeeze the juice from 1 lime right before you simmer for the 2 hours, it always accents the cummin and chili powder very well.

I made this chili before and loved it.  This time I tripled the batch so I could put some in the freezer and I also wanted to do a majority of the recipe can-free.  My personal changes?  1) Rather than canned beans - dried beans soaked overnight and cooked the next day.   2) Rather than ground beef - an inexpensive cut of lean beef cubed.  3) Rather than bulk Italian Sausage – Chorizo (1lb for triple batch) and no Italian Sausage.  4) Rather than canned tomatoes – Tomatoes from the farmer blanched and skinned.  I did use canned tomato paste.  5) Rather than canned green chile peppers – Anaheim chilies from the farmer grilled and skins removed. 6) No bacon bits.  It is a bit more work to make it from fresh veggies but when you are making a batch this large it is worth the trouble for a healthier version (except for the Chorizo).  It was considerably spicier this time, guessing it was from the Chorizo; I won’t do that again.

Perfect chili! The pot was so full that I had to leave out 1 can of beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes, but it was still an awesome chili. All the flavors blend well and cooking time was spot on. Since we have a toddler, I reduced the spicy ingredients quite a bit and that was a good call. It still had a good spice to it in the end. This will be my go-to chili from now on! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe! :)

This was delicious! Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you, It was easy to make. I only made a few changes. I used 5 hot peppers because I had them from the garden, reduced the tabasco to 1 tsp and omitted the cayenne. I also omitted the celery and fried up some fresh bacon chopped small for the bacon bits.
Thanks so much!

My husband loved it! Made a few changes with the chile peppers (using one Thai chile and one habanero also, in addition to the green chile) and added red pepper flakes.

Nice recipe and very flexible!  Substitutions are easy, but it helps give you an idea of proportions.  I made it more or less as written.  The fresh hot peppers give a great taste, not too hot for my family. I was careful not to serve it for a coupe of days after I cooked it in the slow cooker, and it really paid off with a rich mellow coplex flavor.  I served it with shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped fresh japeno (without seeds and pith), chopped fresh tomato, chopped red onion, and fresh cilantro.  It was a real treat.  Chili deluxe!  Thanks for the great variety of chili recipes on this site and to members for all their wonderful ideas.

Best chili I've ever made!  Tons of flavor.  It was hotter than I like, but my husband likes his chili spicy.  Next time I will omit the green chili peppers and let him add red chili pepper flakes himself.  I realized after cooking that the sausage I had was hot Italian sausage, (although the recipe doesn't specify hot Italian or sweet Italian) so maybe that's why it was very hot.  I let it simmer for three hours.  My family doesn't like bits of celery, so I used a tsp of celery seed instead.  Definitely a recipe that you can adapt to your own tastes.

This is an excellent recipe. I'm not sure why some of the folks that have rated it negatively would do so. But I guess some people will find anything to complain about. I made a few adjustments, but it turned out lovely, and was even better the next day. 1.) Instead of using three pounds of chuck, I used two pounds, and added Italian flavored ground turkey, 2.) I used freshly chopped jalapenos instead of the chili peppers, 3.) I used turkey bacon bits, instead of pork bacon, 4.) I used one cup of Guinness Extra Stout as the beer of choice, 5.) I used three cans of red beans and one can of black beans, 6.) I allowed it to cook for 5 hours over low heat adding water as necessary. It turned out great, and was good to have while watching the fight. Its also thick enough to dip with Frito scoops!! Good stuff...

I really wanted to like this recipe, as a fellow Boilermaker, but do not put italian sausage in your chile. It was like eating spaghetti sauce -- the sausage overwhelmed everything else.

But the good news is that the spice combination is good. I substituted texas smoked sausage from Famous Dave's for the itialian sausage and it was excellent. If you can get authetic Texas hot smoked sausage from Kreiz's market(Lockhart TX), for example, it'd probably be even better. Cook the chili and at the very end add some cubed smoked sausage to taste. Add it a bit at a time because it can overwhelm the chili flavor, too.

I made a few changes to the recipe before I made it to lower the heat factor.  I like to eat my food, not suffer through it.  I used only 3 cans of plain kidney beans (drained), 2 cubanelle peppers (as my chile peppers), 3 tbsp of real bacon crumbled, half cup of guiness beer, 1 tsp of tabasco sauce (instead of 2), 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper (instead of a whole tsp), and 2 tsp of brown sugar. All other ingredients were the same as listed in the recipe.  It turned out perfect, with just enough heat.  If it were any more spicy, I don't think I could enjoy it.  My husband agrees, and yes, we love spicy food.  I will make again!  :)

Love it!  Perfect for a winter day in New England.  I have experimented with other recipes and although this has a lot of ingredients it was definitely a winner today.  I did make a couple adjustments. I used 1 lb. hot sausage and added 1/2 lb. sweet sausage (because I needed to use it up in the fridge). I only used 3 cans of chili beans total, (I like more meat then beans). I added a jalapeno pepper just for fun.  I browned the meat and added all the stuff in the pot on the stove (use an extra large one). I let it all cook on the stove while I was chopping and just added as I got things done. Then when I had it all together and every ingredient in the pot, I transferred it to a crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours overnight. Then turned the crock pot off for 3 hours to let it thicken up. Then about half an hour before out guests came we turned the crock pot on warm.  It was the perfect consistency and tasted great!   I'll definitely make it again. And probably add a few different hot peppers to experiment.

Hubby made this for Greycup festivities- the only change he made was that we used 2 cans o black beans instead of 'chili beans' and he threw in an entire lb of bacon (precooked and drained!)... it was fabulous!!  I can't wait until he makes it again!  warning, that cayenne pepper heat keeps building in the left overs in the fridge so after a couple days it's a lot spicier than when it's fresh! So good.

This is by far the best chili recipe I've ever used.  The first time I made it, I didn't have bell peppers, so I just added extra paprika.  I also substituted New York strip steak for the sausage, since we like a chunkier, beefier chili.  I also used chicken stock instead of beer and left out the bouillon cubes (they tend to make things too salty for my taste).  I used fresh (very spicy) peppers from my dad's garden, which probably kicked it up a notch higher than the recipe as written.  The spice combination is perfection.  

I used to be a loyal fan of the  Carroll Shelby seasoning packets, but this chili recipe blows that out of the water.  Goodbye, Mr. Shelby, I'm leaving you forever!  It's obviously a bit more work to have all your own spices on hand and measure them out, but it is worth the minimal effort.

If you like chili, you need to make this recipe.  And if you make this recipe and don't like it, you need to go to a Chinese accupuncturist to adjust your taste buds, because something is wrong.

So good!  It's a chili, so of course I didn't measure everything exactly; and, per some suggestions, instead of bacon bits I cooked up some bacon and used the grease to saute the onions, peppers and garlic.  The bones of this recipe are so spot on that it's a delicious and fun recipe to play with.  Not my first time making this recipe, so I can say that: following the directions exactly or getting creative with it will both lead to a great chili.  Enjoy! (We are :)

This was really good!  It was a bit on the spicy side for us - next time we'll use less cayenne pepper and hot sauce.

This is a family favorite - highly requested meal in my home. I tend to keep a can of purreed pineapple nearby for those who can't quite take the heat. The pineapple tones down the spice while preserving the flavor -  and you can't even taste the pineapple itself! For those of us who enjoy the hot, spicy flavor this is an instant favorite. I will never use a different chili recipe!

Made this recipe for the first time and won 2nd place in a chili competition :)  It was a close competition with the 1st place chili receiving only one more vote.  I made a few changes to the recipe - reduced the amount of chili powder to 2 TBSP, omitted the celery and bacon bits, and added 1 cup of beer.  I made the chili the day before, let it sit in the fridge overnight and reheated in the slow cooker the day of the competition.  Great recipe!

I should have rated this recipe years ago because it is fantastic as is.  It is wonderful on a cool, football Sunday although I sometimes crave it even in the middle of our hot Indiana summers.  It is wonderful as is, but sometimes I substitute the Italian sausage with chorizo for an extra kick (we like our chili nice and spicy and chorizo makes it perfect).  Just make sure that if you make the substitution to be very careful with adding the 1 tsp of salt.... chorizo is pretty salty on its own, so make sure and taste test the chili before adding the 1 tsp.  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

I searched around for a unique recipe, and i chose this one.  The only changes were due to availability.  I may not have won the cook off, but I had many compliments and a recipe I will make again!  Thanks for posting it.
I have now made this several times and took it back to the cook off and won!  Can't say enough about this chili and it freezes and reheats well.

I don't follow the recipe to a T anymore. But I do use this as a basis for my own chili. With the beer, chuck, sausage, and ground beef. I then just get some tomato paste and start throwing in seasonings and other veggies to my liking. It thickens up very nicely (the more tomato paste you use the thicker it will be). Really tastes awesome the next day.

According to my husband: "the greatest chili I ever had!" I made the minor changes suggested by VORCHA but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.   I made it yesterday, let it simmer for a couple hours then refrigerated it overnight. I put it in the crockpot on low this morning and let it simmer all day. We all loved it and are looking forward to leftovers.

Awesome chili! I decided to do fresh beans instead of canned beans and it made the chili even better, I highly recommend doing this...it's worth the extra time! It tastes amazing and I will make it again!!

I LOVE this chili!  Like using this recipe as a base- I add mushrooms and corn.  I also stir in sour cream just before serving it.  It is DELICIOUS!  Spicy, but thats how we like things at our house.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe. I'm not a fan of Italian sausage so I substituted ground pork. I also skipped the chili beans and celery (I prefer non-bean chili and I just didn't have any celery in my fridge) and I increased the spicy ingredients to make this a real burner. It was a huge hit at the office; everyone kept coming back for more.

Great dish.  I live in Iceland so I have to be creative when the recipes call for something that we just dont have over here.  Like chilibeans in a can.  I just bought chickpeas and kidney beans. There is no Italian saucage (and there is NO Icelandic made prpper food sausage) so I bought a Spanish smoked paprika sausage, etc etc.
I used less of the chili only 2 tblsp and went easy on the chayenne.
I have two kids one 11 and one 5. Neither of them used to hot food, so  I sprinked with cheese, toped with sour creme and chips.  They ate UP !!
A miracle, for my 5 year old is a VERY picky eater.
Me and my partner went for greedy seconds.
I cooked the full recipe and froze half for later use.
***  It came out of the freezer GREAT.  I also cooked it for a camping trip in Iceland in the middle of august, it was so good that a double recipe got gobbled up by only 13 people.

These chili was alright but way too much work. It would be worth the extra effort if you could taste it in the flavor but you really couldn't tell. Next time I'll stick to my Chili-o. It tastes just as good and takes 1/4 of the cans that this recipe does.

This chili was very good.  I omitted the bell peppers because we don't like them, I also used 3 cans of chili beans- with sauce and 1 can white kidney beans.  I cooked the meat in a skillet, drained the meat, then added all the ingredients to the slow cooker and let it cook all day.  The flavor was wonderful- and like most reviewers stated, it's even better the next day. Use good quality chili beans whose sauce has a flavor you like, since that does come through.  This will be my new go-to red chili recipe.

OMG. I've been making chili all my adult life, but nothing I've tried in the past compares to this recipe. Love it love it love it! My only critical comment would be this recipe makes more chili than my large crock pot can hold. 

Like others before me I prefer way more bacon (like half a pack) so I delete the bouillon cubes to offset the salt content.

This is the only chili I ever make anymore. I was on a hunt to find the "perfect chili" and for me, this is it! With a variety of flavors, it's complex and satisfying, a perfect fall comfort food. AND, I JUST won a best tasting award with this recipe at a spicy foods party! Give this one a try!

Really great chili. I substitute ground turkey for the beef and use ground pork instead of sausage. I add artichoke hearts, jalapeno & serano pepper as well.

This was outstanding Chili and my family are not big chili eaters.  Everyone loved it.  The changed I did make was I only used 2 heaping Tablespoon of the chili powder instead of 1/4 cup.  Also, since the description of the type of Chile pepper was vague, I used a large fresh Jalapeno pepper, and it was just fine.  The flavors really blended well, and it had a very nice heat to it.  I also used real bacon.

I will never use another Chili recipe. My Chili is no longer "boring" and my family loves it. Usually my father makes Chili for Christmas Eve and he will keep doing so but he says he will now use this recipe. The only note I have is ***USE GLOVES WHEN HANDLING AND CUTTING CHILIE PEPPERS***.

This was an excellent recipe for Chili.  We made a few small changes.  We cut the recipe in half because there was only 3 of us eatting. We changed a few other things too.  I really like black beans so i replaced the spicy chili beans with them.  We replaced the ground beef with ground turkey.  And replaced the bacon bits with real bacon because we don't really care for bacon bits.  My boyfriend who doesn't really care for chili loved it.  We also gave leftovers to his mother and she loved it.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe.

I made this chili the night before tailgating, following the directions almost exactly and ended up with the best, most hearty chili I have ever eaten. People still talk about it! I poured half into a crock pot for the game and we spent the next day eating what was left over. It's even better reheated! The only change I made was to skip the spicy chili beans and Im glad I did. It had plenty of "heat" without them.

Made this today- it was awesome.  I used a few suggested changes from other reviewers. I cut down the Cayenne, rather than 2 chili peppers, I used 1 jalapeno and chicken broth instead of the beer. I cooked the meat and mixed in the ingredients in a stockpot but then moved it to my slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  A great recipe!

Love it even though my husband hated it! Its not Texas chili if that's what your looking for, its a lot less meaty and with less beans. For me, that's perfect because I can really taste the veggies and I don't feel gross afterwards. It's hearty and healthy!

Excellent chili but prep time increased with all those ingredients... if you have the time it's worth it! Fed a diverse group of adults & children so I cut the spiciness. My changes based on reviews: 1 pound extra lean ground turkey, 1 pound hot turkey sausage, 3 cans chili beans with chili sauce included, 1 kidney beans drained, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, cooked bacon bits and dropped chile peppers, Tabasco and cayenne pepper but offered on the side for those who wanted it.

I ate this for lunch and dinner for the next three days after I made it. I may have made it alittle bit more spicey though. Either way it is by far the best chili recipe I have come across.

Followed the recipe exactly and Chili was excellent.  Used New Castle Beer which gave it great flavor.  My only regret is sharing it with friends because I ran out that night.      Thanks to MIGHTPURDE22 for posting this recipe.  Also to all the people that have reviewed this recipe I give my thanks because this is how I figure out if a recipe is worth trying.

Made just as listed.  People were taking home the leftovers!  Not to spicy, not to blah.  You can always set out the red pepper and let people spice it up to their own preference.  Will make again.

Best chili and not hard to make. I used hot italian sausage instead of regular, which made up for the chili peppers that I couldn't find.  Didn't want it too spicy. Came out perfect

I'M a MICHIGAN fan, but have to say, you Purdue folks make a mighty fine chili. Maybe I'll make another batch to take up to THE BIG HOUSE next year. Calling it Boilermaker Tailgate Chili might not go over too well up there though:) Anyway, thanks and have a Merry Christmas.

Made this chili yesterday.  Smelled amazing.  I did not add all the spices as I don't care for hot or spicy food.  It would have been great except for the sausage.  Sausage has no place in chili.  It changed the flavor too much and did not taste right.  Adding sausage to a spaghetti or pasta sauce, yes, but not chili.  Wish I could have just removed the sausage after it was all done.  So, great chili, but leave out the sausage if you want a traditional chili flavor.

I halved the recipe as it was just for the family. Diced and cooked one slice of bacon before adding the other meats. The added the veggies, then beans, liquids and seasonings. Served it with corn bread and honey butter. Was told that this is the best chili I've ever made!

I've made this chili numerous times, and everytime it's a big hit.  I did add a lot more seasoning throughout the simmering time, but of course, it's to taste.  Enjoy!

This recipe is ok. I think that if you elimate the bacon bites and substitute for real bacon and cook your onions and bell peppers, green chilis then add your beer and spices and then add your sauce ingredients and then your substantial ingedients, especially if you use a poreace pan to capture the flavors of the onion...it could be 5 stars. I made this for a chili cook off and was embarrassed. I definately will do more experimenting to find "my perfect recipe."

I made this recipe almost according to the recipe.  However, I used ground sirloin (I had my butcher cut it with the chili blade) and a little more than a pound of the Italian sausage.  I think I added a little bit more beer too.  It is delicious.  My husband told me to add more ingredients at my own peril.  I am entering it in a chili cook off tomorrow.  Hopefully I will do great because it really is an amazing recipe.

I made this for my son's birthday party. The theme was Jet Airplanes, so we called it Jet Fuel Chili. It was an amazing hit! My husband refuses to eat leftovers, but he took this chili to work two days in roll for his dinners and then asked for a printed copy of the recipe for one of his co-workers. 5+*

Fantastic!!  I made it with ground deer in place of the beef b/c my husband killed his first deer of the season last week. You couldn't even tell the difference.  Love to see a great recipe from Indiana with such high reviews. I knew I had to try it.  Fabulous!

Classic chili flavor with an excellent blending of spices and a subtle under tone of heat that builds over time.  I prepared this chili for a neighborhood competition and hands down everyone thought this was the best tasting chili of the day and a couple of people asked for the recipe.  I cooked it for 2 hours the day prior to the competition, refrigerated it over night, and then reheated it for the competition.  I used an 8 quart stock pot which was perfect, leaving about 2 inches of room from the top of the rim.  The beer of choice for me was Fat Tire amber ale and would highly recommend since it pairs nicely with the beef and Italian sausage.  I used a chuck roast and asked the butcher to do a coarse chili grind (once through the grinder rather than the standard 2 times).  I followed the recipe exactly but left out the salt with intentions of salting to taste prior to the competition, but in the end it didn’t need it.  For the chili powder I used Gebhardt’s to give it that classic chili flavor that most people know and love.  I also used Mexican oregano instead of the standard oregano and ground it to a powder with a mortar and pestle to help release more of the flavor.

Made this for the annual Halloween party and it was a HUGE hit!! Everyone loved it, though I did omit the hot peppers and it was plenty hot without them. I would say leave them out unless you are making this for a group you know likes things spicy!

Have made this several times and it always comes out great. We use a chocolate stout for the beer as it adds a wonderful flavor. It's definitely best when made a day or two ahead as the flavors continue to develop. Highly recommended!

This was AWESOME. My neighbor and her 5 kids helped me make this one and oh my gosh did we make some chili. We ended up tripling the original recipe. What I changed: subbed out the chili peppers for one habanero (GREAT idea BTW), nix the sugar, and one of the kids accidently opened 2 cans of black beans. Well, we threw them in, great for the texture as the black beans hold a little firm. Honestly, my neighbor was wary of bullion and worcestershire but it turned out perfect! This and some Southern cornbread is heaven on a 'chilly' day! I brought some in to work and coworkers think it's a family recipe, this recipe is a total hit. Oh, and if you like things spicy (I do, the kids didn't so I omitted it for their 2 pots) try using a habanero based hot sauce in addition to the tabasco and a habanero. Just make sure you can tell the spicy pot apart! ;)

Best Chili EVER!!!!! Although it is perfect as is, we always add either a habanero or jalapeno pepper to add extra spice & flavor, also, we slow cook it all day in the crock pot & it is Awesome every time! Other than that follow the recipe exactly and people we be raving about "your Chili" for years to come!

A+ chili recipe! It has just the right amount of spice and kick to it so you don't have to keep reaching for a beverage to douse the fire.  Really, really easy to make (just chop and drop for the most part). Its tasty with or without the extra "fixin’s" (shredded cheese, sour cream, corn chips, crackers, etc).  As is, it makes a lot of chili.  I got about 20 standard sized ladlefuls of the stuff.  Thanks for sharing!

UPDATE: Today's batch of this chili was made using ground turkey instead of beef (still added the sausage) and I used about 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (canned variety, 4 individual peppers) to add the kick my family enjoys. I inevitably end up making it slightly different than the recipe. I've made this several times now - each time with dry beans instead of canned. I soak them overnight and then use beef broth instead of bullion cubes (not 4 cans though, only 1 can) I never have bacon bits so I use real bacon, cooked and chopped up. I also like a bit more kick so I use jalapenos (either fresh or canned) instead of "green chili" peppers. If red bell peppers aren't on sale I just double the green. Other than that - I follow exactly and it turns out very delicious. This recipe makes a lot and we are just a family of 4 so I usually invite friends over. They don't like spice so I make a small pot without cayenne or hot pepper sauce or chili peppers. Both taste good though I much prefer the hot and spicy version I create. Thanks for a great recipe! Last time I made way to much and forgot to freeze the difference which I will do this time so it doesn't go to waste.

This is by far the very best chili I have ever had! It touches on so many different flavors but none of which over power the dish.  I use to have an old staple chili recipe but, this is the only one I'll ever make again!

OUTSTANDING.  I have won first or second place in an annual chili cook-off three years running.  The only change I make (since I am from Texas) is to replace the beans with seasoned fajita meat that I cut into bite size pieces.

This chili was ok and good for a crowd with a variety of tastes. Not special in any way, though. Too much tomato for my taste... and I could also skip the addition of beer.

This recipe was a huge hit at the poker tournament we hosted a couple of weeks ago. The only change I made was to make it cut down on the green chili peppers because they were really hot. I also used real bacon instead of bacon bits. I'm making it again this Saturday night for Halloween dinner. I'm making dogs for the kids or any adults who want chili dogs with it and I'm pairing it with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread, also from this site.

Awesome recipe! I made the following changes: used 4 slices of real bacon rather than the bacon bits, added a dash of liquid smoke, used 2 cans mild chili beans, one can hot chili beans, and 1 can kidney beans (drained). Used 3 (14 oz) cans of diced tomatoes. Did not use the green chilis, red bell pepper (just because I didn't have one), celery, or tobasco sauce. Used only 2 lb of ground beef (no sausage just because I didn't have any). It was plenty of meat and plenty spicy, and makes PLENTY to go around (freeze the leftovers!). Cooked 6 hrs in the crock pot on high the day before. Put in fridge overnight and reheat before serving. Serve with sour cream and shredded cheese. awesome!

My husband will not stay out of the crock pot!  He is usually a little hesitant of crock pot meals, but he has eaten almost the entire thing- which means he may have a heart attack in the near future. This is delicious, I just wish it wasn't so fattening- so I used italian turkey sausage instead of pork and used lean ground beef instead of ground chuck.  I followed another's suggestion and allowed this to cool and then skimmed off the excess fat.  So, I don't feel so guilty for feeding this to my family. During the cooking process, I added a little water and chicken broth (instead of beer) and next time, I won't use 4 buillon cubes- it seemed a little too salty for me.  I also used 3 cans of spicy undrained chili beans, one large can of tomatoes and no tomato paste as this thickens during the cooking process. It is a success.... What would I do without this website?  We would all probably starve.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe quite close. Some difference: I used lean ground beef, two hot peppers, but not chili's specifically, and I added about 1 1/2 cups of frozen corn, because I'm quite fond of Chili with corn added. Really it's not a lot of change, so I got a good idea what this would taste like had I made it exactly as written. I made this for a Church lunch and it was gobbled up fast!  It was very well liked by the crowd at large; the pot scraped clean long before the lunch was done, while other people's chili's still remained.  If you want a crowd pleaser this is definitly an excellent chili to go with.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Wow! For a very long time I have been looking for a good chili recipe. My search has now ended. This chili was by far the best I have ever tasted! My family loved it, and the recipe was also requested by a friend. It had a very, very nice flavor. Not too mild, yet not too spicy. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce at the time, so I used soy sauce instead, which apparently sufficed. I also used ground Johnsonville breakfast sausage instead of the Italian, which gave it a sweet, nice undertone. I will defiantly make this recipe again!

Just made this for a chili cookoff at work, with 8 other entries, and won! about 70 people voted. I follwed it exactly, and thought it was really good. I do think it took longer than 30 min to chop all those veggies though! kind of time-consuming, but if you have an afternoon, well worth it :-)

I halved this recipe, left out the Italian sausage and bacon bits, traded a jalapeno for the 2 green chile peppers, and replaced the beef boullion cubes with about 3/4 cup beef broth...and this was still the BEST chili EVER. My husband and the company that was over liked it a lot too.

BRAVO! This is about the best chili recipe I've come across in years! Not sure what the Tbsp. of Bacon Bits was for though... I did add it in, but still not sure why. One small Tbsp. got lost in all the rest of the great flavors! I also went ahead and added a whole bottle of beer rather than the 1/2 cup. (I used Amberbock.) I also added a couple of diced jalapenos...the taste was perfection! We didn't even add hot sauce in our plates because it was just right, and we are the type to ALWAYS add more Tabasco. Thanks for this fabulous recipe! We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! UPDATE AS OF 2/2/09: After making this several times now, I have figured out the bacon bit theory! For the quantity this makes, I fry up 5 or 6 thick slices of bacon, set it aside and crumble it into the mix later. Then use the bacon drippings to saute the onion, celery and garlic. Adds wonderful background flavor!!! This always gets rave reviews, as you can tell from the vast number of excellent ratings it's gotten.

I made this for my daughter, whose boyfriend was having a beer tasting party.  She is not really one to pass out compliments, but made sure to let me know that everyone made a fuss over the chili.  She said that she overheard several people saying, "Have you tasted the chili? Oh my God!"  She said several people went back for thirds.
I omitted the celery, added extra beans and used fresh jalapenos. Simmered two hours, placed in crock pot and placed in fridge overnight.  Plugged in the crock pot next day and let heat on low for about 5 hours. When I tasted it to adjust seasonings, it didn't need anything...just tasted "smooth".  I sent tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream to put out with it. No need for another chili recipe.

Super good chili recipe!  The only change I made was to substitute 2 cans of kidney beans for two of the cans of chili beans and to sub Jimmy Dean hot sausage for the italian sausage.  After I got all of the ingredients put together I was thinking that it was way too thick and had no sauce but after it simmered for a couple of hours it was the perfect consistency.  So make sure that you let it simmer for a couple hours before you decide to add any extra liquid to thin it.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was the first time I made Boilermaker Tailgate chile, so I followed the recipe to the T.  I made the chili on Superbowl Saturday and warmed/served on Superbowl Sunday in the crockpot with Fritos and cheddar cheese as condoments.
    Everyone loved the chili!   I overheard many people asking "Who brought this chili?" or "!! This is the best chili to ever get past my chiclets!".  My ears would perk and I would answer "That would be me.  The recipe has been in the family for years and you can't have it.  So don't even ask!".
    
   Good chili.   Make it.

As suggested by other reviewers I made a few modifications:  I used only one chile pepper, cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp., used green pepper Tabasco sauce (it's not as hot as the regular) and I used a whole bottle of beer instead of 1/2 cup.  I was worried the kids would not eat it if I made it at full heat. The recipe was just right for us heat-wise with the cutbacks.   Delicious!  This makes a huge pot, so it left plenty to freeze for later.

Fabulous!  My chili has just finished cooking for 2 hours and I love it!  I tweaked the recipe a bit for fear of it being too spicy.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half, omitted the hot sauce and added a little more beer.  Smells and tastes wonderful!  I look forward to the flavors melting together tonight in the fridge so we can enjoy even better chili tomorrow night for dinner! Thanks!

This is good chili!  I did only use 1 jalapeno (finely minced), 1/8 cup of chili powder (instead of the 1/4 called for) and 1 tsp of hot sauce.  Also 3 cans of beans instead of 4 (seemed like it would've been bean overload otherwise).  I used fresh bacon as many of the other reviewers suggested.  I used four slices, cooked & crumbled.  I think next time I will double the bacon as it gave it a good flavor. We ate this at lunch for a family gathering.  Had something else planned for dinner but they asked us to heat the leftover chili up as well.  This is perfect with a small dollop of sour cream, some crushed fritos and sprinkled with cheddar cheese.  My 78 yr old grandma who eats like a bird ate 3 bowls!  Thanks for a delicious chili recipe!

Best Chili Ever.  I have made this twice.  The first time I didn't have some of the ingredients but made it anyway.  It was delicious.  The second time I made an effort to get more of the ingredients this recipe calls for and it was even better.  I did make some modifications to suit my own taste.  I sauteed the onions, green peppers, red peppers, and celery before adding to the beans and ground beef.  Instead of bacon bits I used regular bacon.  I cooked the bacon, cut it up and put it in the pot.  It's such a nice treat to run in to Italian sausage and bacon when eating it.  I did not add beer because I don't drink it and did not want to buy a six pack to get one can.  It didn't need it anyway, the chili is fabulous.  To add spicyness without it being hot I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and "Red Hot" hot sauce.  Red Hot adds heat and it has a great flavor.  All hot sauces do not taste good.  My chili can out mild but the flavor is incredible!  Thanks a lot!

I forgot to purchase tomato paste, but it was excellent without it.  I'm putting it in next time.  Other than that and using canned tomatoes for half and fresh from the garden for the other half, I followed the recipe as written.  It was the best chili I have ever had, and I'm sure it would be much better with the paste.  Like other reviewers, I think the leftovers were better once the ingredients had had a chance to "marry".

We LOVED this chili. It was the best chili that I have ever made. I threw everything in the crockpot and just left it alone all day and it turned out wonderful. Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you, it's incredibly easy!! I omitted the red pepper and celery and I don't really care for either and I also left out the chills and I'm kinda a wimp when it comes to spice. After it cooked for a couple hours I added some sriracha hot sauce that gave it some really nice flavor, some more salt and pepper, a little more Worcestershire, and garlic powder. Be warned though this makes a TON! I only cook for two people so we had leftovers for days! I ended up freezing some and am interested to see how it reheats.

I made this recipe for a chili cookoff where I work and won first place. I used hot Italian sausage, jalepeno peppers instead of all the other peppers, two large cans of tomato puree instead of diced tomatoes and tomato paste and omitted the celery and bacon bits.  When I browned the ground beef and sausage, I added the jalepeno peppers and onions. What a wonderful smell in the kitchen! I put all of the ingredients in the crock pot to simmer all night. Then when I went to work, I reheated the chili. There was plenty of time for all of the ingredients to blend into wonderful flavor. The judges of the competition were local firemen. The "heat" of this chili did not hit them right away, but after about twenty or thirty seconds, they were looking for milk! The entire pot of chili was devoured by all who attended and I was the envy of the competition. Thanks for a great recipe. Don and Sharon Evans

Worth the work. Excellent slow cooker recipe!
This is a great chili recipe. It takes some time, but try browning the meat& onion and throwing it all in a slow cooker on low for 8hrs.

This chili is amazing. I made it for a party that a friend and I were throwing. She made a Barefoot Contessa chicken chili and I made this one. Everyone preferred the Boilermaker chili and my friend asked for the recipe :) I made a few changes so it wouldn't be too spicy for a big crowd which worked perfectly - 3 Tablespoons of chili powder, no Tabasco (I figured people could add it after the fact if they wanted more spice) and no chili peppers. I also decided to use 3 lbs of beef chuck and no sausage. I just like the consistency better. I served the chili in a buffet with things they could add in - avocado slices, sliced jalapenos, sour cream, shredded cheese and diced onions. We had chili left over and ate it the next day. It was even better so I suggest making a day ahead.

LOVED IT!  I had to leave out the tabasco, cayenne and black pepper because of my girls and I had to use serrano peppers because the store did not have the green chile peppers.  Those were the only changes I did to the recipe and I put it into the crockpot; awesome!  I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the residents of the group home I work at tonight. The guys all loved it. I made a few changes, I used more garlic (3 cloves and about 1tbsp powder), used one red, yellow, and orange bell pepper, I added green onions to the mix and also garnished with them (with shredded cheddar and sour cream of course!). Due to lack of preparation, I did not use any paprika or white sugar (substituted brown). I also upped the amount of Worcestershire sauce, beef bouillon and cayenne pepper (we like things spicy around here!).

It's good chili, but really really really has too many ingredients. The taste is nothing that can't be achieved with half the ingredients and half the time.

It was decent.  It took a lot of work for the final product, and I didn't even use any bell peppers or Tabasco.  It would have been way too spicy with Tabasco.  This recipe didn't make me love chili, like I was hoping it would.  I am not a huge chili fan, but the people I live with are.  I don't think I'll be making it again anytime soon.  It was too chunky, and I prefer smoother chilis.  Person with me loved it.  If I do make it again, I'd have to scale back the recipe because there were a ton of leftovers after I had already halfed it.  If I made this often, I'd have to make a spice mixture with the ratios they used so that it wouldn't take all day just to fill the crock pot.

I made this as my first homeade chili, and followed the recipe exactly. I've made this about 4 times now, and I dont even look at other chili recipies, because I dont think chili can get any better than this. I usually put the chili in a slow cooker and cook on low for about 8-10 hours, until the veggies get soft. I also followed one review, and sauted onion, celery, and garlic in bacon grease. I always use about 5-6 slices of fried bacon, and I definately think this adds to the flavor. Also, I also follow other reviews (If I have the time, and plan ahead accordingly haha) and cook the day before, let cool, and reheat the next day. Seems like it helps the flavors all blend toghether this way. Again, I don't think Ill ever change too much about this recipe, it is awesome. Gives me a reason to throw parties, or get toghethers, just so other people can experience this stuff haha...

Loved, loved, LOVED this recipe! We made it for a family "Welcome Fall" get together we have every year, where we have a couple different kinds of soups. Everyone loved it and there was hardly any left. And it makes A LOT. It just barely fit in our crock pot without overflowing. Since some people in the family don't like things too spicy, we just used 4 cans of regular chili beans, which we didn't drain. We also used a milder chili pepper (I believe they were Anaheim). I will definitely make this again and may substitute cut up chuck roast next time for an extra "meatiness" factor.

This chili is great!  Everyone loved it!  My husband and I both agree that it is the best chili we ever had.  I used ground turkey instead of the beef and used spicy Italian Pork Sausage and left out the hot pepper sauce, chili peppers and cayenne so everyone could control their own heat.  I also substituted the celery and green chili pepper with an extra green bell pepper and left out the beer.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours.  Great!!

SO YUMMY.

These are the changes I've made over time: leave out the beer; use 1 or no chili peppers (d/o mood); replace two of the chili bean cans with 2 cans of black beans (I like the change-up in colors w/ black beans). I'm sure it would be great without these changes, but I don't care for beer and I reduce the qty of chili peppers to reduce the heat. This chili punched me in the face the first time I made it with all the peppers. Besides, there is plenty of heat w/o the peppers so I figure it's fine. IMPORTANT NOTE: Wash beneath your nails (or wear gloves) after preparing everything, and again after putting all the spices in the pot. I neglected to wash the pepper juice out well enough one time when making this, and the internal burning nearly reached my elbows. Seems like a little common sense, yes, but sometimes I don't think. Also, use your biggest pot. I tried this out in my 6qt slow cooker the first time and it doesn't fit. I use a stock pot and it fits nicely.

In the end this will be probably be the best chili you've ever eaten. All these ingredients, and the cost, is totally worth the effort.

Dang it!  Too dang nabbit good for words.  And, YES, if you object to a bit of spice (not overwhelming to moi) you may want to tone it down a bit.  The only sub I made was 1 can of pinto's, a lil extra hot sauce/cayenne and I had a red pepper and a yellow pepper.   Other than that, I used HOT NY style sausage and let it cook a good long time....Five stars - CONGRATS!

First time ever making homemade chili. It was fantastic!!! I had my entire family over for chili and homemade cornbread. They all raved it was the best chili they'd ever eaten and wanted the recipe. 
I did change the recipe slightly. I omitted the bell peppers and celery. I added 1 pd. hot italian sausage and  1 pd mild itanlian sausage and 1 pd of cube steak. I served jalepenos on the side with cheese and sour cream!! 
This is one of my familys  new favorites and will be a tradition for years to come! Thanks for sharing!!!!

Loved it.   Very flavorful, not at all like the little packet of mix I usually make.   The hubby says its one of the best he' s eaten.  ( the down side, is he' ll never want the simple one packet mix again)

At first I thought there was too much liquid.  I added about 2 tbsp of cornmeal to thicken it up.  I put it in the fridge overnight and reheated the next day.  It was perfect.  Great consistency!

This is now a new favorite I did make a few changes by not adding a couple of things just for personal preferences and did not have some of them. (sausage, bacon bits, green chili peppers) so I upped the amt. of beef and added more of the chili in spicy sauce and it was so good and I am sure it would be just as good with the omitted items. it was so good I had to make it 3 times in the last month thanks for the post I will never make another recipe.

Only the 3rd time I've ever made Chili, but the best I've ever tasted. Minor changes made to suit my tastes as far as heat and left out a couple of items I didn't have - like Cumin and bacon bits. Awesome recipe.

First time making chili and it turned out great! I swapped and omitted inredients for ones I had available. The best suggestion was to buy diced tomatoes with garlic/oregano/basil already added. I put in a few different types of canned beans, half a bag of mixed frozen vegetables, and some shredded chicken to make it my own. If you're worried about running out, buy extra beans and diced tomatoes to stretch the chili

This Chili is wonderful and meaty!

I recommend using 1/2 a pound of fresh bacon-- chop, cook, and add to the chili.  Also, I have added Srircha and Sriracha-Brand Chili paste.

If you don't want it super spicy, omit the spicy peppers from it, and it'll be fine.  The other dry spices are not that spicy, and give it a nice small kick.

Very good chili!  I threw everything in the crock pot as we were going to be in and out of the house all day.  I left out a lot of the spice too because we have little ones.

THE VERY BEST! It looked way too spicy though. I used a little bit of carribean hot sauce instead of Tabasco sauce. Took out the celery and beer, used kidney beans instead of chili beans in spicy sauces. (couldn't find those anywhere.) I used ground buffalo instead of ground beef chuck, didn't put any sausage. I omitted the bacon too. 1/4 cup of chili powder is way to much. I used 1 teaspoon. I used a jalepeno instead of a chile pepper.  I've made it a lot of times without those things (omitted sugar too), and I will continue to make it that way. Thanks!!!

P.S. Did you mean to say 1/4 CUP chili powder?

A fantastic chili recipe!! Everyone that tried my chili raved about how it was the best they'd ever had. You could actually see the reaction on their faces as they ate it. I did make a few additions/substitutions. I liked what 1 reviewer said about not using bacon bits and instead crisping up 4 slices of bacon. Btw, bacon bits is not real bacon at all. Why not have the real thing? Anyway, I also followed the same reviewers advice, and sauteed the celery, garlic and onion in a 1/2 tbsp of bacon grease until the onion is translucent. I also added 1 mexican (red) jalapeno, hoping it would add to the spiciness, but I don't think it did. I may add a couple more next time. I also didn't have cayenne pepper on had, so I used 2 teaspoons of chipotle chili powder, and I also added an extra teaspoon of chili powder as well. It really went well with the Fritos, I used the lightly salted Fritos, because I didn't want to add to the salt content too much. I also used shredded sharp cheddar cheese as well. It was fantastic!!!

Really great chili recipe.  I made the following (minor) modifications -- 1) substituted 1 pound ground pork for one of the 2 pounds of ground chuck, and used 1/2 pound andouille sausage and 1/2 pound chorizo in lieu of the italian sausage 2) used 4 cubes of "Not beef" bouillon rather than beef bouillon (can find these at Whole Foods) since I'm not a fan of the various unnatural ingredients found in typical beef bouillon), 3) added a tablespoon of cocoa as some other reviewers suggested for flavor depth, 4) used 3 cans of beans instead of 4 and 5) fried up black forest bacon (also found at Whole Foods) instead of bacon bits.

I made this a day ahead, simmered on the crock pot for a couple hours, and then the next day re-warmed in the crock and simmered for a couple hours before eating.  Will definitely make it again!

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a HUGE hit!  I don't like chilli and have only made it one other time in my life, but I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  They all want the recipe!  My husband wants to submit it at the next chili cook-off it was that good.  A lot longer than 30 minutes prep time but well worth it.  Thank you so much!!

this is an EXCEPTIONAL chili recipe! if you want to skip the celery, peppers, etc,,,(although they add to the color and variety of texture) the rest of the recipe is still phenomenal...i have made it with and without. The Beer and all the spices are what makes it the best tasting base ever!+++

I turned this into a slow cooker chili & am so glad I did!  Here's what I did: Cook the ground beef and Italian sausage in a frying pan.  While it's cooking, dice the onions and a few cloves of garlic.  Once the meat is almost done, drain the fat, then toss in the onions & garlic and cook until browned, several minutes.  Throw that in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients & voila!  It was ready (& delicious!) after only 2 hours on low, but I am sure will be even better when it simmers longer so I've left it on low for a few more hours.  

I also halved this recipe and it turned out great.  I used a little more beer (and still a full onion) and the flavor was just right - a good amount of heat but not "make me cry" hot!  Thanks for sharing, this is wonderful!

i cut this recipe in half and it still made a ton of chili, two things i did to make this the most exceptional chili  i've ever made was 1) i use muir glen fire roasted diced tomato's and muir glen tomato paste, if you have never tasted their canned tomato's you don't know what your missing!!!! 2) i used grass fed beef chuck and sausage.  It is more expensive but WELL worth it, taste wise and health wise.  Thank you mightypurdue22 for this amazing recipe!!!!!

I never actually got to taste this because my husband wanted it to take to work for a chili cookoff.  He said he thought it was a bit spicy.  My daughter however who doesn't like spicy, ate two bowls of it before it left the house.  She also said she didn't think it was the best chili she'd ever had but she did eat two bowls.  The preparation was very labor intensive and I'm not sure I'll ever do it again.  But thanks!

i cut the spicy ingredients in half, and it was tolerable by most people even most kids. i don't think it would have been as enjoyable with full spice, but i will still definitely use this recipe as a guideline in the future.

I ALWAYS make recipes exactly as written the first time because I HATE when people give high or low ratings and then go on to say they changed a million things.  The first time I made this it was WAY too salty for me but my husband loved it.  The next time I omitted the salt and used low sodium beef broth and I thought it was perfect.  I give recipe as written four stars and with my very small changes five stars. Either way, this one is a keeper!

Good but not spicy enough for me. I added some fresh oregano and rosemary, lots of Sriracha chili sauce and chocolate.  I won the chili contest with this one.The original recipe didn't place in the top 3.

Fantastic recipe... Equally great with ground venison substituted for the beef and sausage.

Made it just as it says, though I dropped a couple Habaneros in there.  I let it simmer for about 18 hours, too, so everything was great...  Recommend simmering at least 12 hours.  It's a completely different chili if you let it go that long (if you can hold back that long).

Awesome recipe! As a first time chili maker, I was a bit intimidated by the long list of ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly- for the most part, and it turned out great.

After all the meat already in the chili- I omitted the bacon - and I forgot to buy tomato paste, so I substituted a little bit of ketchup instead .. otherwise everything was pretty much the same .. Also - for the beer, I used 312, a Goose Island Wheat beer - which was great, and I got to drink the rest!

The chili has a nice kick to it, but it's certainly not over powering (for me!) I'm actually considering making it a little spicier next time .. 

I served with fresh cheddar cheese and tortilla ships .. I'm thinking about making a plate of pasta to serve with the chili next time.. 

My co-workers loved the chili and asked me to bring in left overs tomorrow..my boyfriend is feeding all the guys at work today as well!

This is a great chili recipe! It was a tad soupy thats why the 4 stars. I didnt use the chili's or bacon bits. But I did cook up some bacon and sautee my vegetables in it. I served with butter milk cornbread and Alabama Fire crackers from AR. Leftovers will be chili dogs, frito pie and chili baked potatoes.

OK, I have made many many pots of darn good chili in my life. I even won a Chili Cookoff a few years ago.  This is right up there with the best chili ever. Only changes I made was to add a can of black beans, pinto and kidney, also used water instead of beer.  Added 1 large diced fresh jalapeno instead of green chile peppers. Still cooking in crock pot, and even tho not done yet, it is absolutely delicious.  Make this and enjoy, it is quite spicy but we love it that way. Bet will be even much better after flavors blend tomorrow.

This is a great standard chili recipe that can be adapted based on what you have on hand/need to use up/etc..  I used a can of chili beans and a can of pinto beans, also used all ground beef.  I halved the recipe and used beef broth instead of bullion and used a decent amount because I wanted a slightly soupy/less thick chili.  I also didn't add the beer (didn't want to waste one for only a 1/4 cup).  I ran out to run some errands and just put the pot of chili (in a dutch oven pot) into the oven at 350 for 2 hours. Easy as can be!

Best chili I've ever had. Feel free to double the beer (the taste is wonderful). I also added red pepper flakes for a kick. After browning the meat, you can put everything in a slow cooker to make things easy. Oh, and I also replaced the bouillon cube with a can of beef broth.

I am unsure why, but this gives me the worst stomach issues I've had while eating food.  I'm starting to wonder if by chance one of the vegetable ingredients or something else was not all the way cooked within that two hour time frame.  It's not just me either but anyone who eats the chili. If anyone has a clue I would be interested because it doesn't seem how small the amount of this chili it still causes issues.

This recipe is really great for people that have never made chili before.  I have made this about 5 times over the past year.  And it it delicious!!!!  I have adjusted and added a few ingredients.  I add a can of black beans and a whole jalepeno.  I also add a bit more garlic.  I don't use bacon bits or celery.  Mine comes out very spicy, and I loveeeeee it.  Seriously, if your looking for a good chili that everyone will rave over, this is it!!!!!

Great! Easy too. Just dump everything in. No separate cooking in the steps. Very good, layered flavours...especially next day. Might suggest a touch of sour cream to top, along with the cheese.

this recipe is a keeper. 

I followed the recipe exact in regards to the spices/seasonings, but instead of the ground beef chuck I used a 60/40 version of ground beef, ground pork. I also used some chorizo, a package of bacon cut into 2" chunks that I browned lightly in the frying pan then added to the pot .. for the beans I added 2 cans of a '6 bean medley' that I found at the grocery store.. then I pureed some jalapenos with some hot red chili peppers and put that in there with the red hot sauce and omitted the 1/4 C. chili powder.. the spice was perfect. used a 'aged oak ale' that has a real nutty/honey flavor, and monterey jack cheese with the tortilla chips for the finale... did let it sit over night, it thickens and is perfect. makes alot for leftovers/in the freezer..

This is by far the best chilli recipe I’ve found/ made.  All the recipe ingredients are great and make for a great base platform for you to add/ play around with the recipe.  The only significant change I made was substituting ½ have the ground beef with ground pork.  10 stars for this one!!!

THE BEST!!!  I have never had a better chili.  My Sundays used to consist of me trying to make a better chili than the previous week.  When I made this I quit trying.  You're not going to top this one.  We had a chili carry-in at work this winter and mine was the only crock pot that was empty at the end of the day.

I loved this recipe!  (And so did all my co-workers)  I was missing a few ingredients (such as green chile peppers, Worchestershire sauce, dried basil, etc.) here and there but it still turned out wonderfully.  I can't wait to make this again and with all the correct ingredients.

We love this!  Adjust the Tabasco sauce if you are looking for 4 alarm chili.  We also added one full 15 ounce can of hot chili beans and heaping tablespoons in the recipe scaled to 6 servings and call it Michigan Wolverine Chili :)

Great recipe.  My wife and I love it.  The only thing I changed was halved the Chili Powder.  The original portion was a little too strong.  Also replaced the chile pepper with habanero to give it a "zing".

Really amazing; I had never made chili from scratch before and this wasn't hard at all. I didn't add the italian sausage because there wasn't a good selection at the store that day so I added a bit more beef. It turned out a bit soupier than I had wanted, but I think it's because when I cut the recipe in half I added too much beer. whoops! It kept really well in the fridge for a couple days too, which is always a plus.

Best ever! Followed exactly but added whole beer & added brown sugar.  Made it for 15+ on a recent camping trip in September & again on Christmas eve.  Both times by the end of the night, it was ALL gone even though it filled my crockpot to the tippy top.

Great recipe! I had never made chili before but this recipe was super easy! I used sprite instead of beer, coriander instead of cumin (I was out of cumin) and  garlic salt instead of minced garlic. Yummo! Definitely a crowd pleaser on a cold snowy night! :-)

Even though I'm a rabid Florida State Seminole fan, this chili is the best I've ever tasted.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, just added 1/2 lb more ground beef and added a full bottle of beer and extra can of tomato paste. Awesome!  Way to go Purdue!

I also felt this was a good base recipe. I omitted the bouillon, additional salt, hot sauce, bacon bits, the peppers, beef chuck, italian sausage,tomato paste,beer, fritos and rinsed my beans. I also added mushrooms for more "heartiness", some liq. smoke and 24oz of some basil tomato spaghetti sauce (i ran out of tomato sauce) along with 2 (28 oz) cans of diced tomatoes with basil/oregano/garlic, 1.5-2 T of celery seeds(since I didn't have celery) and I used ground turkey and ground turkey sausage which I added within the last hour. I cook it about 2.5 to 3 hrs stirring every 20-30 min. And tweak it as needed towards the end. I'm no expert but my family and I like it. I serve with some simple buttery crackers, a melted slice of cheese and a sprinkle of some parm.

Absolutely delicious.  I did not have any Worcestershire sauce or bacon, so I left those out.  Used ground turkey instead of beef and roasted red pepper instead of fresh.  So fabulous, everyone said it was the best chili they ever had.

I made this for my husband and he loved it! Left out the cayenne pepper and instead used a few drops of Tabasco Habanero sauce. It just kept tasting better and better 2 and 3 days later. I found myself dipping the Fritos Dips in the leftovers even cold when I'd go into the fridge for another reason altogether! Addicting....

Excellent chili! I will definitely add this to my permanent recipe box. The only thing I changed was I used 4 slices of bacon, cooked and drained as opposed to the bacon bits. Delicious!

I think this chili recipe is awesome and I've made it countless times. It's become our family chili. Great flavor, lots of ingredients,  and a good kick depending on how much seasoning you use. I use two cans of medium chili beans and can of hot. While I generally make per the recipe, I have substitued the pork for Italian seasoned Turkey for a lighter version or chorizo for something different. This recipe makes a big batch, but it freezes very well!

I use 2 pounds of turkey hamburger instead of beef chuck with the Italian sausage so its a little leaner.My last batch used about a pound of venison since it was fresh! I also experiment with different types of hot peppers. I like to add chipolte peppers in adobe sauce as well. Fresh chives,mushrooms,corn,and other things add great flavors too. I love the base recipe and make it at least once every month or two!! All my friends love it!!

This recipe is (and I don't say this w/o some reservation) the B-E-S-T chili I've ever eaten.  The heat is perfect.  Not overwhelming, but there.  And the layers of flavor build on one another like no simple chili recipe can offer.  Five stars baby!

I actually won a chili cook-off with this recipe recently.  I substitued cured salt pork for the bacon bits, wine for the beer, honey for the sugar, and fresh herbs from my garden for all the dried ones recommended.  I also used hot peppers from my own garden, which nearly got me in trouble - at first taste the chili was distractingly spicy with an uninspiring after taste.  With advice from a friend this was improved by adding a few dollops of yogurt and a two squares of dark chocolate.   I let the chili sit for a day, then warmed it up again ever so slowly.  It was fun to watch everyone go back for seconds.

Winner!  I won my first chili cook-off last night!  Changes: Added Spicy brown mustard; and with the sausage I added 1lb of ground beef and 2lbs of Beef Chuck Cross rib Roast.  I cooked them a little before putting everything in a crock pot.  I used fresh bacon from the butcher.  I used only 2 cubes of beef bouillon and instead of the 2 Chili peppers I used 1 Jalapeno Pepper.  Couldn't find Spicy Chili beans so I used 3 cans of chili beans that had chili peppers, onion and garlic.  1 can of red kidney beans for more color.  I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes.  Everyone said the heat was perfect.  Great recipe!

If you REALLY want to make a GREAT chili, PLEASE do yourself a favor and make this one!! Being a person who does not like alot of heat in dishes I prepare  I did not use the 2 green chile peppers or the Tabasco. I minced four large cloves of garlic for the minced garlic it called for, and I used 3 cans of Bushes MILD chili beans WITH all the liquid. I omitted the red bell pepper, because I felt $2.00 was too much to pay for 1 pepper, I used beef boullion granules, and for the bacon I fried 3 pieces of good thick bacon and chopped it up rather than use the imitation bacon bits. I felt it needed a touch more of a sweet taste, so I put in about 1/8 cup of brown sugar!  YUM!!

Everyone loved this chili.  The only changes I made were using ground turkey for the beef and veggie sausage for the ground sausage (trying to make it a bit healthier).  It still turned out great!

I made this twice, once with hot italian sausage and the hot sauce, and once without either because the kids thought it was too spicy.  It was excellent both ways, although personally I liked it with the extra spiciness.  This is definitely going to be my main chili recipe from now on!

Great recipe!  I like the richness that the beer gave the chili and the peppers added a lot more flavor too.  I didn't add the celery, for I just don't think it belonged.  For the sausage, I used half sweet italian and half hot for a little more heat.  And we don't like it super thick so instead of using 2 cans of diced tomatoes, I used 1 can crushed and 1 can petite diced.  I like to serve it with shredded mild cheddar, chopped green onions and a dollop of sour cream.

Made this for may family and LOVE it! Best Chili recipe I've come across in a long time. Spicyness was perfect; just enough to get a bit hot. Have an eleven year old who loves it and didn't complain about the spicyness! Made recipes as listed.

Oh my  goodness! This was the best chili I've ever had. I'm rating it based on some of the alterations that others had suggested, and what I had used based on availability. But wow! This is so easy to tweak to your own personal tastes. 
I used 1 lb of Bob Evan's Zesty sausage instead of the italian sausage, kept the ground chuck the same, increased the amount of beer as others stated, only used one can of chili beans because no one in my house is a big fan of heavily beaned chili, and didn't use red or green peppers because I'm not a big fan of them and didn't have any but the Zesty Sausage already has a pretty decent kick to it anyway...YUM!
This chili is so hearty and delicious and just explodes with flavor! I will be using this recipe over and over again.

It's a great recipe "as-is"  Have a good aged cheddar to sprinkle on top. Crackers always complete chili, but if you want to take it up a notch...put a cornbread round in each cup/bowl.  Its a nice surprise and the contrast of the sweet and salty will rock your taste buds.

This is the hands-down best chili recipe on here. I skipped the chili beans and just went with 4 cans of dark red kidney beans. I also used hot italian sausage and some skinny red peppers my friend gave me to up the heat a little bit. I brought it back to my dorm room, and the boys down the hall INHALED IT. It's definitely true, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, especially with this chili!

I made this chili for my family. Now keep in mind I have 2 very young children (7 and 2) so I  slacked off on the hotter spices, and it was one of the best chili recipes I have tasted. I also didn't add the beer. I would definately make this again.

I made this for my family and they went nuts over it! I will be making it regularly from now on. I omitted the sausage for dietetic considerations and used more ground beef instead. Also, I had no fresh celery so I used 2 tbsp of dried celery root instead. This is my first review and   just HAD to post it, that's how good this came out!

I made this for a chili cook off for work with a few changes: fried up real bacon instead of bacon bits, added another can of tomatoes, and dashed in soy sauce by accident instead of worcestershire sauce. Otherwise, made it as written and brought it to work the next day in a crock pot. It was really tasty, and it won the chili cook off. Very nice! Everyone wanted the recipe so I sent them to this site. Thanks!

STOP LOOKING! This is the best chili recipe! The modifications I made were only because I didn't have a couple ingredients so I substituted, and personally I think it turned out to my advantage!! I fried 4 strips of hickory smoked bacon and crumbled it up, instead of using bacon bits. I used chunks of steak meat, cut in thin strips instead of 2lbs of ground, because I only had steak/stew meat. I will always use steak meat anyways- it was delicious, the meat was falling apart, and it made the chili chunkier! Instead of Italian sausage I used a yummy hot sausage, cut into chunks. I fried each of the meats separately before throwing them in the crock pot, draining the fats. I tossed the steak meat in garlic powder, salt, and flour and browned it in a pan. Then, I used wine instead of beer to clean up the pan of all the flour and spices that were stuck and poured it into the crock pot. I also added at the very end, 2 tablespoons of cornmeal, because I like my chili thick, and it looked a little soupy before I did that. My husband came home from work, tried a spoonful and said, "I want this for dinner tonight!" I tried telling him we're supposed to eat it the next day, but it was so delicious he wanted it right away!! Still, we have plenty leftovers for tomorrow, and by all the reviews it's supposed to be even better!! I can't imagine that! My husband says it's a keeper and he wants me to enter it in this years chili cookoff! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We loved the spicy, hot taste of this chili.  I did change a few ingredients - used ground soy, Butterball turkey sausage, roasted the red pepper which gives a much better flavor, used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes in juice, no salt, beef bouillon or Fritos.  I will definitely fix this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is by far one of the best, if not the best, chili recipes ever.  You taste all of the ingredients and the heat from the peppers follow but don't overwhelm. What is also really great about it is that it is easily scalable to meet the taste of your guests without dramatically affecting the overall taste.  I lke it a little thicker so I drain one of the cans of tomatoes.  ALLWAYS picked as the best at cookoffs.

great!! The only thing I would change for next time is to use fresh tomatoes or low sodium canned ones instead of regular canned so it isn't as salty.  I didn't add the extra salt it called for and it was still far too salty.

I followed Nhi Torres (11/15/05) suggestions and the Chili was great.  The chili was for an outdoor fall party and there were two crock pots of chili.  By the end of the evening, mine was GONE and the other was not.  I would not call myself a cook at all so I was amused at all the people who asked me for my recipe.  Has such a nice bite to it.

Excellent chili easy and delicious just the right amount of heat, in the back of the throat NICE. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I wouldn’t change a thing. I did top with diced sweet onion, shredded sharp cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.MMMMMM!! Make it, you will be glad you did.

I loved this chili, the flavor is great!  It's by far the best I've tasted.  That being said, it was too spicy for my family and I even left out the Tabasco.  If you like it mild, you'll have to really adjust the cayenne, Tabasco, and green chile peppers.

This chili is sooo AWESOME!!I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cooked mine in the slow cooker overnight. The next morning my entire house smelled sooo good! And my husband loved it so much he took some to work and one of his co-workers could cmell it while he was eating and she asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this chili again and I am sure it will be even better on a cold winter night.

Very disappointing. I thought I would change up my regular chili and make this one.  DH didn't like it and asked where the regular chili I make was.  He always likes my cooking but asked for me not to make this again.  Big let down for all the work I put in.

I have never been a big chili fan and have actually never made it myself, but my husband requested chili for dinner yesterday so I made it with this recipe.  I absolutely loved it, and will definitely be making it again in the future.

This is a wonderful chili recipe. I chopped up 2 lbs of steak tips rather than ground beef chuck because that was what I had on hand. I substituted MorningStar Farms vegetarian sausage patties, chopped, for the bulk Italian sausage. I used 2 cans of mild chili beans with sauce, 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of black beans. I did not use celery or beer. Instead of 2 chili peppers, I used one serano pepper, chopped with seeds removed. I left out the bacon bits. I substited one 14.5 oz can of beef broth for the 4 bouillon cubes. I cut down on the chili powder just a smidge and added 3 teaspoons of hot sauce rather than 2. I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. I substituted 1 teaspoon of maple syrup for the sugar because I am a big fan of maple syrup. I sauteed the vegetables and spices in some bacon fat in a stock pot first, browned the beef in a separate pan, tossed everything in with the vegetables and cooked it over medium heat for 20 minutes. Doing it this way cut down on the overall cooking time and developed the flavor of the spices. I would make this again with these adjustments, except I might try using ground chuck or ground beef, which would be more cost effective. Thanks for the recipe.

Looking for a healthier version of this delicious recipe? I used this as a reference recipe, but make it much lower in fat. I used ground turkey as well as homemade turkey sausage (from this site). I double the kidney beans, add an extra can of tomatoes, and up the spices a bit to account for the extras. This results in a delicious version that nobody notices as being low in fat! I freeze it in individual portions and have an instant lunch or dinner. Thank you for the delicious recipe. With a few tweaks only for health reasons, this has become a favorite!!

Really enjoyed this-I added finely minced fresh ginger, and used 3 different peppers (jalapeno, anaheim, and serrano). I also added more diced tomatoes-really delicious! For toppings, we diced an heirloom tomato, cilantro, red onion, avocado, shredded cheese, and lime wedges...great!

This is the first chili that I made. I brought it to a family chili cook off and won first place! (out of 10 different chilies) It has a great full taste and a mild slow burn after you eat it which I love. I would recommend this to anyone and will be making it again.

My first time making chili for myself, and this was the best chili I have tasted.  I get chili at every restaurant I go to, and this is a match for the best of them.  I did 1.5lbs chuck and 1.5lbs HOT italian sausage, and used 3 medium beans and one hot.  I also used 3 chopped slices REAL bacon.  I used serrano peppers.  Between the serranos and the hot italian sausage, I got the most perfect heat level.  It was hot and made me sweat, but my mouth would stop burning when I stopped eating.  It was a great flavorful and meaningful heat, not just a rediculous over the top heat.  This chili is fantastic, and if you are thinking about trying it, stop thinking and start doing.

Delicious chili, but I prefer a more fresh tomato/veggie flavor. The tomato paste and beer were a little too prominent.

This was great.  I used what I had as it was too cold to go to the store.  It was a tad salty, so next time I'll take that into consideration!

I figured with a five star rating and over 700 raters this chili must be GREAT.  I neglected to read that most people altered the recipe to get it to five stars.

I made it according to the recipe and it required much doctoring before I could serve it to our guests.

The chili was average, not spectacular.  Good, not great.

This really is as good as it gets. It is quite a bit of work and money if you don't already have a lot of the ingrediants. Do yourself a favor and cut this recipe in half or in quarters, because this makes a rediculous amount, I ate this for like a week. Good amount of flavor and good amount of heat, would say it's just right.

awesome chili!!I cut the beans in half though ( hubby doesn't really like a lot of beans). As an update:Using fresh tomatoes (had a garden full) made it taste even better!! Not to mention a great way to use up the surplus of tomatoes.

This chili is awesome!  My husband won our church chili cookoff last Sat. night. (with a little help from me ;))We didn't use the celery. Celerly in chili?  We used 4 cans chili beans, no spicy ones, 4 cans Hunt's tomatoes Fireroasted with Garlic, and that gave me the idea to grill the veggies with the 1 lb skirt steak he put in.  Next time will reduce ground chuck to 1 lb and add more skirt steak. That really made it great.  We're Mormon, so we didn't put in the beer and didn't put in any tabasco or cayenne pepper.  The heat was subtle, just right for our crowd.  We used a large red jalepeno and let the whole thing simmer overnight on low heat.  In the morning I put the chili in the fridge and reheated it just before leaving for the cook off.  We got so many compliments!  I'm not a chili lover and I loved this chili and will only make this recipe from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I just made this chili today and it was pretty good, but probably not worth the trouble.

I did omit a few things; the worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any; the 1 tbsp of bacon bits because I didn't see how that could possibly make a difference; and one can of beans because I ran out of room in my large crockpot.

I have to add, too, that the prep time of 30 minutes is, in my opinion, grossly under estimated, unless you're Edward Scissorhands or have everything chopped and measured for you like Emeril!  From the time I started until I put the lid on the crockpot was well over an hour.

If I make this again, I would probably leave out the Italian sausage, but that's just me.

Made this in my big dutch oven and it nearly overflowed - I ended up needing to pour it into an extra pot. It also came out way too spicy, which was my fault, because I used a special Mexican chili powder. For those out there who haven't tried it yet, you might want to add half the amount of chili powder at first, and adjust to taste - depending on how spicy your spice is! Ultimately, however, it's still an AWESOME recipe with a classic, delicious chili flavor.

I browned the meat and then threw everything in the crock pot (although it didn't quite fit) and it was a good dinner. But, it was AMAZING when we reheated it the next day. I will definitely be making this again, and try making it the day before, as others have suggested, since it really does enhance the flavor. UPDATE----I just made this again, and used steak instead of the ground beef. Yum! Makes it very gourmet tasting.

I am a Texan.  This is GREAT chili.  I have made it twice for entertaining and everyone raves.  1/2 cup beer does not cut it here as the chili is very thick.  I add 1 cup white wine and 3 12oz beers. The consistency is just right!  I will never make another chili.

It was good, but I missed that Chili taste.  This tastes more like a tomato based tortilla soup than chili.  But it was still good, just not what I was expecting.

cooked it for myself and others and was an absolute hit! If you dont like a lot of kick I would suggest cutting back on the spicy beans and cutting out some of the hot peppers. The recipe is just warm enough to get the nose running a bit.....

Love this chili!  Made it while my family was here for the holidays, and everyone enjoyed it.  All the different peppers and hot sauce made me a little nervous, but put them all in, and it was perfect.  We aren't beer drinkers, so left that out and added a little water, but think I'll add it next time ... and there will be a next time!  Leftovers froze well, and I'm enjoying the last bowl as I type!  Thanks for sharing this one.  (Update 2 years later:  Have made this several times and always turns out great.  Made a double batch today in my turkey roaster ... perfect size! 16 people finished off all but 3 bowls, which were scarfed up as "doggy bags".  Just thought it was worth noting that this does not look like typical chili at first! Without the usual heavy tomato sauce/paste base many people are used to, what you see, initially, is just a big pot of tomatoes, peppers and ground meat!  As the tomatoes and beans begin to break down during the long cooking time, it begins to look less like ground beef soup and more like chili should look, so don't let the initial "look" concern you.  And I do add the beer now, which does add to the complex flavor, although I have yet to add those bacon bits!  I will try real bacon some time.

Chili was good, but I would not say "IT IS THE BEST EVER" like some!?!?  It was A LOT of work...I'd love to meet the person that can "prep" this in 30 minutes!!!  We really couldn't taste some of the more unusual ingredients (ie: bacon, beer, celery, worcestershire, etc...) ALL we tasted was chili powder!!!

This recipe is AWESOME. I made this for about 20 people and everyone loved it. I didn't use spicy beans, bacon bits or cayenne pepper. I substituted turkey italian sausage for pork sausage to accommodate my guests. It turned out great. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

WOW!!! This recipe is by far the best chili ever. I made only a few small substitutions-used Chipotle chili powder rather than regular chili powder because we like really spicy. I used real cooked bacon instead of bacon bits and added a can of chick peas too. My husband loves chili and he went nuts over this one

Very good! I omitted the celery and used onion powder instead of fresh onion (not a fan of celery or onions) and it was delicious! And of course the house smelled great while it was cooking. We put cheese on top for a little finishing touch, and I added a bit of sour cream and Fritos to mine. Very very good. It takes a while to chop the veggies and measure the seasonings, but it is worth it. This recipe is a keeper.

Thank you for good chili,  used yours for a chili cook off at our church and against 18 others, I took first place.  I sold out 30 servings in less than 1 hour.  Made money for the church and had very happy members, many who came back for seconds.

This was the first time I have ever made chili and it was a HUGE hit with my husband! He enjoyed it so much that he gave some to his father who is an experienced cook. I got a phone call from my father-in-law requesting the recipe and great reviews too...said it was a lot better then his recipe.  Overall, it was extremely well liked....reccommend this to people who like some "heat." Note--used hot italian sausage and one of the cans of diced tomatoes had green chilies in it....to make it even spicer!

This was so awesome!  My husband and I have been looking for a great chili recipe and have finally found the one!  The only thing I did different was use fresh bacon over bacon bits.  Thank you so much... YUMMY!

Fun and creative!  I made this one for "Les Boys" and our Grey Cup party, and it went all 110 yards!  To make it distinct, I tripled the corn chips, and subbed out the sausage for portobello mushrooms, and let firm tofu play QB instead of the beef chuck.  Great play!  It was spectacular!  Strongly recommended!  

(PS- I'm not familiar with "bacon bits" but it still tasted delicious without them.)

I have made this probably 8-10 times. I started out exactly as stated and it was excellent. I like to experiment a little with other suggestions here and tried many most did not taste as good as the original recipe. This last batch was by far the best I have made. It was close to the main recipe but here is what I did. I used a little less than 3lbs ground chuck and 1 pound Kroger brand Hot Sausage. I used 3 cans beans not 4: 1 can chili beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 can black beans all drained. 6 stalks medium sized celery, I didn't have any chili peppers so I added 1TB crushed red pepper (like you put on pizza), 2TB Hormel Real bacon bits, no beer but substituted 1 can chicken broth, 3TB Worcestershire sauce, 4TB Franks Hot Sauce, 2 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp sugar. Then added 2TB Hershey's Dark Cocoa for coloring.  After cooking in slow cooker for 8 hours on low I put in refrigerator overnight.Then made some sweet cornbread with jalapeno in the iron skillet with added 1/4 cup good grade syrup to the batter and melted bacon grease in skillet before adding batter. FOLKS...this was the best and everyone in the family agreed...it was gone in less than an hour. I will do this exact recipe again.

More like 4.5 stars, as I've got pretty high chili standards. We make and eat a lot of chili, and have made this several times. This is one of our favorites...especially when we have time to make it. It has really good, complex flavor and like all chili, tastes even better the 2nd day after the flavors have a chance to meld together. It does take some time to make, with all the chopping and prep, but have fun and enjoy the process! I Made this along with Wazzu Tailgate Chili, and we kept flip-flopping as to which one we preferred. This will stay in the rotation. I admit this next statement isn't a news flash, but really, the quality/brand of the ingredients makes a huge difference as to the flavor. Chili Powder is a BIG one. I use Morton's and Bassett and Penzy's mostly. I get Italian sausage from an Italian market where it's made fresh. Canned tomatoes are really affect final outcome and I've found Muir Glen Organic and Hunt's have the best flavor (to our taste buds). If you like big chunks, the MG is the way to go. For people who prefer a smoother, less chunky texture, Hunt's petite diced is a good option. "Heat", is a personal thing, so adjust accordingly. I can't to a lot of heat, so I cut the proportions of the hot ingredients accordingly and omitted the hot sauce, otherwise, I could tell from the recipe, it would've been too hot for me.  Really a great chili, beans and all.

Oh my! This was AMAZING! Apart from the Spicy Chili Beans (used 4 regular and added half a can of chopped jalapenos instead), I followed the recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS! Even better the next day. It's definitely a keeper.

This is very good chili.  I like it hotter so I used more chili peppers and less bell peppers.  Other than that and adding more cumin and a little cilantro I made it pretty much as written. Everybody liked it.  Of course there's always some Texas chili snob on here downgrading every recipe that doesn't include lone star beer and is stirred with the horn of a steer.  Disregard that.  I've had Texas chili.  It's ok but no great shakes and definitely not as good as a lot I've eaten.

Delicious!  Followed it as close as I do any recipe. I used fewer beans and held off on the Tabasco since it was already too spicy for my children. I loved all the flavours!

An excellent chili!  A bit spicy for our tastes so just modified a bit to cut down on the spice.  Love the use of fresh veggies and the mixture of the ground beef and Italian sausage.  Good and hearty with lots of flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! I've made this a bunch of times and can't say enough about it.  I've tried it with chorizo, and was ok, but hot Italian sausage is the way to go with this one.  Plus try jalapenos instead of the chili peppers, and more garlic.  I plan on entering this into the chili cookoff at work the next time it comes around.

This stuff is absolutely amazing!  I have found myself swapping out the peppers on occasion.  I love spicy so every once in awhile I'll put habanero's or jalapeno's in place of the green chilies.  But overall this recipe is astounding either way!  I made no changes other than alternating the peppers sometimes.  But the recipe is great as written!

This was hands down the best chili ever! I made this for the hubby and he LOVED it! We love spicy food and use hot sauce with every meal, but I was getting a little worried this chili would be too spicy. I cut back (just a little bit) on some of the spicy ingredients. I'm glad I did. It was PERFECT!!! It was hot enough for us and very tasty. Definitely making this one again!

I won the neighborhood 4th of July chili cook off tonight with this recipe. Over 50 people voted on the 12 chilis entered, and this one won by a landslide!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I made it the day prior though and let it simmer for about 6 hours (lid off for about 4 of those hours so it would reduce nicely), then refrigerated overnight and put in my crockpot on low for another 6 hours the day of the cook off.  So delicious!

OMG - this totally rocked the frikken house!  I made it for a staff meeting and it was GONE before the meeting was over.  It truly is the best recipe I've ever come across for chili.  You must use all of the ingredients... because the layer upon layer of flavor that you get from each one is incredible.  It's labor intensive, just a bit...but ohhhhhhhh so worth it!!

This is the best chili ever!!!!  A little too spicy for our taste so I only use 1 pepper and no cayenne. I also purée the veggies in a food processor.

Wow.  That's pretty much all I have to say.  It takes a long time and requires a lot of chopping and a lot of spices, but oh so worth it in the end.  My husband, a born-and-bred Texan, was in love with this chili.  It made the house smell amazing while it cooked.  I cut out half of the cayenne and removed the ribs and seeds from the 2 peppers before cooking, and I liked the spice level, but hubby said it was a bit too mild.  Just adjust the spiciness to your own taste; the flavor is all there with this one.

My husband cannot get enough of this chili.  When I make it he refuses to let me throw away any left overs, even if they have been in the fridge for a week.  The sausage really gives it the extra flavor.  This is a staple in my house.  I make it at least once a month.  You will not be disappointed!

My first attempt at Chili and it was a success. I would like to taste some more heat. I can't tolerate extremely spicy food but this was not spicy at all. I would make this again but try to work on spicing it up.

second year that I've entered and won first place in a chili cook off! Use 2 lbs cubed chuck steak in place of ground chuck. I added brown sugar in place of the white and added it to my taste. Also used 3 different beans....dark Red Kidney, Light Kidney, and black beans. Did everything else the same. Used light beer cause it's all I had and turned out well. This is for sure an award winner!

Best chili recipe I've tried so far. I really like the flavor added from the beer-- we used a full cup of Yeungling amber lager. There are many ingredients, but getting a pre-chopped bell pepper blend and using a can of green chiles removed some of the chopping work for me. I sauteed my peppers and onions after cooking the meat, and I omitted the celery. After browning the meat and vegetables, everything cooked in my crockpot for a few hours, went into the fridge overnight, then heated in the crockpot again the next day until it was time for dinner. I worried it would be too spicy based on some reviews, but it wasn't at all. I might even add more cayenne or Tobasco next time. My husband has never loved the chili I've made before, but he and our dinner guest both thought this batch was great.  This will be my standard chili recipe now.

Consistently good. Like other posters, I also brown the meat first and then add everything to the crock pot. I have made lots of variations over the years with different types of meat/sausage (beef, chicken, turkey, chorizo, Italian, etc.) and it always comes out great. I always make a big batch and freeze it for camping trips - it's even better eaten by the fire!

Awesome chili!  I can see why it won so many chili cook-offs.  The beer imparts a great flavor.  I used half a can of Yuengling.  Don't waste your time with light beer or you'll miss the flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly with regard to the seasonings, but used stew beef which I chopped into small bits.  I also changed the cooking order a bit. Start out in a large dutch oven.  I sauteed five slices of bacon, cut into small pieces and removed from the pan  when crispy.  Then brown the beef in the bacon fat in batches, removing it to the same plate with the bacon. My beef was so lean that it absorbed all the fat.  Next brown the sausage and add the chopped vegetables.  The fat rendered from the sausage will allow the vegetables to soften. I used just one large green pepper and two large hot chili peppers (one green & one red) which I unseeded but did not remove the membranes in order to preserve the heat. Add your dry spices next and sautee a bit so they have a chance to bloom. Instead of two large cans of tomatoes, I used one can plus two cans of petite diced tomatoes with green chilis.  Then add the boullion, beer and Worcestershire sauce.  Last are the beans--one can of chili beans in sauce (undrained), one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of pintos, both drained and rinsed.  Transfer the chili to a slow cooker and cook on high for about 5 hours.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a really good recipe. Not mind-blowing but definitely a keeper! We are trying to cut animal products back because they cost so dang much, so I replaced all of the meat called for with a lb of diced mushrooms. They simmer down and give a nice meaty texture without the fat and cost!I made a few other changes as well to meet our liking, but it was great! Served it with some tortilla chips only. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at making chili, but since we were having a chili cook off for our annual Memorial Day cook out, I thought it would be fun to make and this recipe appealed to me. I made a few changes: I thought the use of Italian sausage was strange and substituted 1lb of cubed Andouille sausage instead and 1lb of cubed chuck roast. I fried 4 large strips of bacon, softened the vegetables in the bacon fat, then browned the chuck roast in the same pan and followed by the Andouille just to heat it up a bit. I started with about 1/4 of the chili powder and pepper sauce and increased the amount at the end as needed. Also used brown sugar instead of white and a bottle of IPA, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of kidney beans,and 1 can of chili beans. Stirred it up and placed in a slow cooker for 8 hrs. Let it cool down for a few hours and then back in the base let it reheat while adjusting the spiciness. I didn't tell anyone I had made chili and after a blind taste test by the crowd my chili was chosen the winner! I declined the prize however since as the host I thought it seemed a bit tacky to one up my guests. But thanks for the recipe. Definitely a keeper and people were asking for the recipe.

Tried this recipe as written. Great eatin' chili, as is. Will make a change, here or there, but this is a great base recipe for all you(like me) chili heads. Try it as is and make your "to taste" changes as you see fit.
Never did understand reviews that say "OK, but made changes because(insert reason), and so I don't think this is more than a "X" star recipe."
Try it as written, write your review, and help us all out!

This is an excellent chili recipe and I won 1st place out of ten contestants. I made it the night before, cooked (simmered) it for about 2.5 hours, let it cool and then placed it in the fridge.  It is more flavorful the next day - trust me as I made it for superbowl weekend to test on my wife and we both agree it was much better the next day.  I modified it a bit and used real bacon as others recommended and sautéd the onions, celery and garlic in the bacon grease.  I used 1 lb Black Angus cube steak, 2lbs ground beef and 1 lb spicy Italian sausage. I browned the cube steak then added the ground beef and Italian sausage.  Drained the grease then added the rest of the ingredients. I also substituted the sugar with brown sugar. This is so easy and so flavorful and I won 1st place the second time making it... Enough said.

This is a really great chili! The long ingredient list does create a great blend of flavors and is well worth the effort. I cut down on the spice and it was still really HOT! Thanks to another reviewer for posting the secret to reducing the heat! It worked immediately and did not change the taste of the chili... But it reduced the heat. My husband is a wimp when it comes to heat and it would have ruined a rather expensive pot of chili. Thanks to MightyPurdue22 for posting this!

Great recipe.  However, you may want to go easy on the tobasco and Worcestershire sauce if you're not  into super-spicy dishes.  I also leave the Italian sausage out.

I made this recipe for a football game party we had for the USC vs Utah game. Though on the field the result wasn't pretty, this chili made up for the game. Everyone loved it! I wasn't sure what "Green Chili's" were (I've only saw canned green chili's), I just assumed that they were jalapeno's. I diced them and included the seeds of one. This is easily the best chili recipe I have found online. Thanks for sharing!

Followed to a "T" except for one simple sub:  I used 1lb Italian Sausage, 1lb Ground Chuck, and 1lb Ground Turkey Breast.  Let it simmer all day (about 8 hours) stirring every hour or so.  FANTASTIC!  We make a great chili, but this bests it for sure!  It is a bunch of prep/ingredients but I just did all my chopping, put in a bowl, then measured out all the spices and put into another bowl, then finally measured the liquid ingredients and put them in a bowl.  Brown/drain the meat, open cans and dump (draining the non-spicy beans first) then pour the bowls in, and mix well.  Really not that difficult if you have all this stuff on hand.  I used Heinekin beer (2/3 of a bottle (don't ask where the 1st third went at 10am while chopping))  :)  My new go-to recipe for chili!  OH, and this makes about 4-5 quarts - so be prepared for an army or lots of leftovers!    (Next time I will add a bit of dark chocolate to the concoction).   THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

I have read the reviews, and what surprises me is that a couple thought it was disappointing! I have made it twice now, and it's the heartiest chili and best tasting I have had. Yeah the list is long on ingredients, but people we are cooking!!! It's fun, get into it. Enjoy this. I know we are.

I used this recipe as a sort of guideline to make chili that was catered more to my taste. It came out flippin' fantastic. Here are some of the changes I made: first and foremost, I used ground turkey instead of beef. No you can't tell the difference, yes it is way healthier for you and will skim a bunch of calories off of that terrifying 600 number. Second, I bypassed the sausage (also skimming a ton of unnecessary calories) and got a little inventive to pick up the texture; I used, bear with me, 20 oz of sweet potato! I know, but trust me on this, it's not only healthy, but absolutely delicious. Also, I used 2 medium chili beans and 2 mild, because I don't like crying while I eat. Ha. Anyway, it still had kick. I skipped the celery (didn't have any) and bacon (for health) and used one yellow pepper instead of red and green (didn't have any of those either). I only used one green chile pepper (I have a plant, so they're more potent) and got the diced tomatoes with chile peppers in them to make up for it. I used four beef bouillon cubes, but added a fifth, somewhat larger cube which I assume was chicken bouillon (don't ask). I think I only put 1/4 cup chili powder, but the container sort of slipped and.. oh well. I like thick chili, so I skipped the beer and added one can each of black beans and corn to make it chunkier. I didn't have cayenne, so skipped that and added about 1/4 cup brown sugar to the white for taste. I topped it with cornbread, cheese, AND sour cream. YUMMM

I have made this recipe 4 times now, once for a fundraiser and it got rave reviews.  My husband is a traditional chili fan and he did not find any taste difference with or without italian sausage.  Other changes that I have made (not all at the same time): used 3 cans rotel tomatoes with habaneros, and there was absolutely no need to put in any chili powder, or tabasco, or cayenne.  It was medium towards hot spicy with just the tomatoes. I always add a full can/bottle of beer.  I omitted the beef bouillons twice and no change in taste. I have omitted Tabasco even when not using rotel tomatoes and still no change in taste.  I used liquid smoke once and came out delicious (1-2 tsp), used sliced jalapenos instead of chopped chile peppers and no change in taste; also completely omitted them with spicy tomatoes and never noticed.  I have used just 2 lbs beef and no more meat and it was great.

I'm not surprised you won chili cookoffs with this recipe.  I have been making it for years and everyone loves it.  It is the best chili I've ever made.  It may be too hot for some, but it is perfect for us.  Delicious

This was a very good recipe! I halved everything on the ingredients list but made a few of my own changes.  1) 1.25 lb of ground turkey instead of italian sausage and the chuck (I promise you can't even tell the difference!)  2) 1 can of chili beans in the sauce and 1 can of kidney beans drained.  3) 1 can of chili tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes  4)  I didn't add any bell peppers, but I think it would be good with them but I added 2 jalepenos instead of the chile peppers  5) I cooked the bacon first and sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat  6) Added half a can of low sodium chicken stock, mainly because it was already open in the fridge and I wanted to use it up.
I know I made a lot of changes but it turned out so good with these modifications!! You must try!

I am completely impressed with this recipe. I only made one minor change, I added a 1/2 cup of water to the brew as I prefer a little extra liquid. Next time, I think it will do this in the slow cooker, all chili just seems better after cooking a long time. Prior to today, I had been using the same chili recipe for five years, but I always want to try out the 5* recipes on this site. I am very glad I did! I am abandoning my old recipe for this one! TWO THUMBS UP!!! :)

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! The only changes I made were omitting all but one can of beans, used more Worcestershire sauce, used 93% lean beef, and completely omitted the beer all together.  I wanted to make it as low calorie as possible and it worked!  Only 283 calories for a two cup serving.  YUMS!!

I think if you can "loosely base" ingredients your own way with a recipe and it works, it's a good recipe! I didn't have any chili beans, so I used an actual can of pre-made chili, chicken stock instead of beef bouillon, pork and bacon flavored sausage, 1 lb of venison, 2 cans of tomato paste, no celery, a little olive oil, and pretty much everything else the same. I also cooked everything separately then threw it all in a large pot, so it was ready once it was heated up! The flavors were SPOT ON, my husband couldn't get enough and is looking forward to left overs. Thank you for this recipe, it works with even a few different things!

YUM!!!  I used this recipe, sorta loosely, but put everything in it that was listed (except green chile bc I didn't have it).  My green chiles were a little on the hot side (I roast my own), and I also pulsed my meat after browning it to make it a little smoother; this was a fantastic base!  Even my picky manfriend liked it--Excellent!

Wow, that was good. I didn't have any ground beef, so I just used some not-spicy sausage. Our whole family loved it. The depth of flavor was fantastic.

I hate to be a spoiler - but this chili seemed to be like a little kid playing dress up - piling on as many pretty things as possible and looking like a loud mess.  It's really a cross between a spaghetti sauce and a chili, and it tastes like it can't make up it's mind.  All the flavors fight each other.  I prefer a smooth, spicy, rich chili.

This is a great recipe, everytime I make it I get rave reviews from everyone.  This is probably the only recipe that I actually use every spice, and measure them out exactly!!! The only things I chaged were using real bacon (4 slices) , then sautee the onion, celery, and peppers in the bacon fat. Also, for one of the cans of "chili beans" I substitued a can of "tri-colored beans" (black beans, pinto beans, and kidney beans) just to give some extra flavors and colors to the pot.

I have entered chili contests before and I REALLY wanted to like this recipe. I've made this recipe three different times and it still has a tinny taste and leaves a coating in your mouth. I switched up brands, hoping that would solve the problem, but no such luck. Sorry, but this would not pass any chili cook off in my area.

Made this superbowl sunday and it was a big hit! I prepared it the day before and it was great after spending a day in the fridge! I was afraid it might be too spicy, but in fact turned out to be not that spicy at all. I added extra hot sauce to the crock pot on Sunday. Flavors were excellent, everyone loved it. Next time I will add more bell peppers and more beans, just for my personal tastes. I also did as one other reviwer suggested and sauteed the onion and celery in the leftover bacon drippings (I fried my own bacon rather than use bacon bits.) Overall, this recipe is a keeper!

I didn't have all of the ingredients but what I did have turned out to be awesome!  Left out bacon, sausage, tomato paste, red pepper and chilies.  Added onion.  Cooked the meat, then cooked all on high in a crock pot.  Mmmmmm.  Hubby loved it too.  Thanks for the recipe.

My wife makes her recipe, but she was sleeping so I came here and found this one.   I didn't change a thing except to add more peppers, as it needs extra heat.   This is a keeper and my wife admits it's better than her's.  :)

Wish I could give this 6 stars. Absolutely amazing... all other chili now seems plain compared to the depth of flavors in this one. It has a lot going on... so much so that we nicknamed it the $50 chili because it has so many things in it. But it is well worth it. Everyone who tastes it loves it. It is a winner every time.

Just made this for Super Bowl Sunday, here in my hometown, Indianapolis!!! It smelled so good cooking, we couldn't wait and had a bowl and already, it is awesome! I made some changes, added 3lbs cubed beef, bulk sausage and peppercorn bacon, BBQ sauce, and omitted celery. I also braised the meat and threw everything in a slow cooker and it is killer! Can't wait 'til Sunday to eat a bowl!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  Feeding two very hungry men at home who happen to love love chili, this recipe (untouched) is ALWAYS a hit and never lasts long.  The portion size is great, the balances of taste - perfect.  Wouldn't change a thing on this recipe other than I usually do not top it with the cheese and chips since the chili itself it good alone

This chili was REALLY flavorful. I really loved the taste of the beer. 
The only thing I would change would be to add more spice - Next time I'll use jalapenos instead of poblanos. Other than that, it was a hit!

I've won two chili cookoffs with this recipe. I make sure that my sausage is a good quality, that's a must or it gets an 'off' aftertaste. My first award was the people's choice award. For that one, I left out the cayenne. For the judge's choice that I won, I put in some of the cayenne to add heat. I now have two trophies!

Really great! This one's a keeper. For those of you worried about spice- I used spicy Italian sausage, diced-unseeded jalapeños as the green chilis, and used 1.5 times the chili powder and, while it was spicy, it still wasn't as spicy as Chipotles hottest salsa.

The most delicious chili I've had!! A little on the spicy side though for the kids, so if little ones are going to be eating this you might want to cut back on the hot sauce/cayenne pepper.

Fantastic. I did not need 12 servings so I halfed everything and it came out great. I also put everything in a crock pot after all the cooking in the pan. Let it go for about 3-4 hours and it made the meat so creamy. The only thing Ill do differently next time is double the hot pepper and Tabasco sauce. But that is just due to me being a spicy fanatic. :-) Love this recipe...

I have made this chili numerous times.  I am now the official chili maker when we get together with family and friends.  The only thing I do differently is I like to add rotel for a little extra kick and I add a small can of mushrooms.  We all love how all of the different seasonings all come together.

EDIT** I still make this chili often and found that if you add a can of chipotle peppers and a poblano pepper, it gives it a nice kick. I made this for a Halloween party and EVERYONE wanted the recipe!!! I can't say enough things about this chili! Thank you!
First attempt at making chili and this is awesome!  Best tasting chili I ever had.  I did make some changes (of course).  I used real bacon and sauteed all of the vegetables in the bacon grease, then dumped this into the crockpot with the other ingredients.  I added a full bottle of beer and 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa (seems to be everyone's secret ingredient).  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

OMG! Made this chili for the first time last night and feel like I have found the Holy Grail of Chili recipes. I have looked for years for that perfect texture, flavor combo and this recipe had it all. The list of Ingred. was a bit intimidating BUT in actuality we had all the spices in the cabinet already. I found this an easy and heavenly delic. recipe. Thank you so much for posting it and from saving my family from another bad pot of chili!

I just hate to nay-say because I am also a Boilermaker.  We enjoyed the chili but cant do any spice in my house.  So, omitting all of the heat really made the chili not as amazing and full of flavor as I am sure it would have been.  But thanks and Go Boilers!

Rave reviews from guests rooting for Michigan State in the Outback bowl. Both Sparty and the chili were winners! Might have to re-name it Big 10 chili.

I have made a lot of different chili receipes over the years, but this was definitely the best.  I added one additional can of the stewed tomatoes and used coke instead of the beer as I didn't have any beer.  So good!

I have used this recipe as my basis of my chili for the past 3 years and have heard many great reviews.  I tweak the seasoning ratio by the way it smells and add dash of clove and cinnamon along with the rest of them but I use it super sparingly because you can really kill a recipe by going overboard.  I feel like it empasizes the sweetness of the chili this way.  I love to use Chipotle Tobasco sauce along with Tapatio and Habenero sauce.  Instead regular bacon bits I also use canadian bacon.  I feel like you should go big or go home when it comes to bacon and it seems to taste better especially as far as texture goes.  Some beer can really make a difference when cooking with it so be careful what you dump in and don't use a really strong beer, although malty beer can make it seem to taste sweeter, more of a molases undertone. Definitely a grat reipe alone but if you tweak it to your taste it can be the most amazing staple you keep in  your freezer!

My son made this for a scout dinner. It was a hit! We pre-mixed the spices and sauces so that he could just add the canned goods, meat, and fresh veggies. Makes a ton.

This chili is the BEST. I get rave reviews every time I make it. I forgot the bacon but it was still perfect. I followed the recipe otherwise. THE BEST! Update: Over 4 years later and this is still the best chili. I usually use Rotel, I don't bother with bacon, I use whatever chili pepper is on hand (anehiem, poblano, Serrano), and I use brown sugar instead of white....oh, and make it with cornbread- preferably jalapeño honey cornbread. Yum yum yum. Sometimes I pour the whole beer in there. But the seasoning is just right. I usually make adjustments but not with this one. It's perfect.

Made this for my dad's 50th B-day party and it was a HUGE hit! I doubled the recipe and there was none left over. Couple things...I didn't use spicy chili beans, only regular. I used Rotel tomatoes in place of 2 of the cans  of diced. I used jalapenos instead of chili peppers and red pepper flakes instead of Tabasco. This can be a very versitile recipe. I will DEFINITELY use again!

What to drink?
Beer! 
We love this recipe. I make it alot. We are a family of 5 and we eat 2 days from it! It is VERY HOT & spicy so I use only 1 tablespoon of chili powder and still we think its very spicy. Also I don't add the sugar and the salt.

Added a Serrano pepper, used hot sausage, and it was absolutely the best chili I'd ever eaten! Made it a second time and let it slow-cook in the crockpot for 6 hours and it was even better. Amazing thing was how the flavors became more intense over the next several days.

A huge hit at dinner this weekend!  Adjusted slightly to decrease the heat: 1 T. of chili powder and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Did everything else the same and it was amazing!

i had a chili cookoff at work, that I actually forgot about, when the reminder went out the day before,I had to come up with a recipe quick!. I have never cooked chili so off to allrecipes.com I went, I picked the first 4 star recipe and went to work. And wouldnt you know it, I won 1st place which was a total shock since this was the first time I actually made homemade chili! I followed some of the other reviewers tweaks such as frying bacon then cooking the veggies in it, but other than that I stuck to it. It made such a large pot that I had to use two crock pots so I froze the second and the next weekend I defrosted it and heated it, it was even better the second time around!

This was really delicious! I hate it when people change the recipe too much and then rate their own version...but...I did not have green chile peppers and used half the cayenne pepper. It was plenty spicy and it was very flavorful. Definitely, the chili recipe from now on. My neighborhood demands it every year for the Halloween party!

this was good chili - it does make a ton.  It is very mild though.  So if you like spicy chili you'll need to add some red pepper flakes or more hot sauce.  but if you don't like spicy then you should definitley try this.  I won't make this recipe again and that's the reason for the 3 stars.
EDIT - 11/7/11 Well I'm changing my review to a 5-star because I told my boyfriend that I'd rated this a 3-star and he told me that I needed to edit my review to a 5-star because he thinks its the best chili!  who knew?!!  He'd like me to add some kidney beans and some beef chunks - stew meat or chuck roast.   A neighbor who had some also told me he and his friends absolutely loved it so ... there ya go!  The boys think think this is a 5-star recipe.  I'll just add red pepper flakes to my bowl *grin*

I doubled the recipe (made a huge pot for a pumpkin carving party). The only thing I changed was adding once packet of chili seasoning and not using as much chili powder, and added a few diced canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I also just used some Italian diced tomatoes instead of adding basil and oregano. I let it simmer on the stove for a while to reduce and meld the flavors. My favorite chili recipe, will make many more times, thanks!

Excellent chili....as with the others I made a few modifications and eliminated a few things such as the celery.  I substituted the 3 cans of chili beans for 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of regular chili beans.  Instead of green pepper and 2 chile peppers I used red, yellow and hot peppers.  I also skipped the hot sauce, oregano, basil and cumin and just 2 packets of McCormicks chili seasoning.

AWESOME recipe! I doubled it and only put 2 green chilies in(instead of 4 if I had doubled them too) and left out the cayenne and it had bite to it. I think it might be too spicy for some with all the chilies and cayenne added. I was perfect the way I made it, tonnes of flavour!

Very tasty. Even my chili-critical brother enjoyed it. We used pieces of beef chuck instead of ground, which added some great texture and meaty flavor.

First, let me say I never rank and comment, so you know this chili must be to die for... 
Made this chili last weekend.  It was without question the best chili I've ever made.  I made only slight modifications, as follows:  used cubed chuck beef cut in large chunks, used slightly less chili powder and lightly chipole hot sauce.  I was worried about the heat, but it was perfect.  I could probably have used the specified amounts with no problem.  I brought in to a night simmer on top of the stove in a cast iron casserole, then baked it for 3 hours (grate at the lowest level in the overn) at 300 for 1 1/5 hours, the 275 for the remaining).  Truly, you won't be disappointed.

My husband made this yesterday afternoon - heated it up for lunch today - AWESOME chili!!  He isn't really a "measuring spoon" kind of guy, so I'm sure he just tossed things in, but following the ingredients list closely...this is great.  He said, "It's the best chili I've ever made" - and he's made a lot of chili in his day.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

My search for a good chili recipe is over, this is the one.  It was so good and versatile.  I cut the recipe in half and toned down the spicy flavors for my kids.  It still tasted great!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

this was a lot of steps, but on a cool sunday afternoon, had the cousins coming over to help build a workbench in the garage, so while the boys were outside, the girls were inside pulling this recipe together and listening to some music!  We all loved this, it made quiet a bit and so we invited a few more friends over to share.  Everyone had some to take home and we still had some as leftovers the next day.  I highly recommend following this recipe as written, you will not be disappointed!

This chili is amazing! The only change I make is to use 2lbs of beef stew meat instead of sausage. It also freezes very well.

I am not a chili person and quite honestly, I rarely eat it. However, this is the only chili I will eat. It has a flavor unlike no other. Not too lumpy. Just enough of a good bite of hot spice. LOVE IT!! Makes plenty with enough to freeze as well. You won't regret trying this recipe. Everytime I make it the crowd is pleased!!

Great recipe!!  I was a little hesitant on the tabasco, but it is a great addition.  If you are not up for spicy though, cut the cayenne down to about 1/2.  I also added 2 TBSP of Cocoa Powder and 1/2 cup water in lieu of the beer, in addition to 2 TBSP of chili powder (just doesn't seem right to make chili without chili powder).  

definitely two thumbs up on this recipe!!

To tone down the spice I used plain beans, mild Italian sausage, 1/2 t. chili powder and omitted the chile peppers and hot sauce.  This is very mild, but still has some chili flavor from the chili powder.

My husband and I and our son-in-law and grandson thought this was really great chili. The only changes I mde were one jalapeno chili in place of the green chilis and kidney beans in place of the 3 cans of chili beans. It was as good as a more involved prize-winning recipe I have made.  Thanks MIGHTYPURDUE22.

In spite of being an Illini fan this is the best chili I've ever had in my life!  And, after eating it themselves, my family agrees.  The one modification I made to this chili is drop the ground beef chuck from 2 to 1 pounds, and add a pound of chuck roast cut into bits and browned in a canola oil.  DELICIOUS!!!!

This was terrific!  Everyone loved it but it was a little spicy.  We did not add Cayenne and used 2 Serano peppers (seeded) but still a little spicy.  The pineapple juice add another reviewer wrote about to cut down spice but keep all flavors worked perfectly.  Great recipe - that for this!

This recipe was awesome!  I made it for my grandfather who just had surgery so I omitted the chile peppers and only used half the hot sauce so it wouldn't be too spicy.  It still had a kick to it but it was perfect for him once i added  the cheese.  If I was going to keep it for my family I would have made just as described.  Must try!

This was the first chili that I have ever made and it was delicious.  My husband and I made a whole recipe and just froze some for later.  I will definitely make this one again.

I've made a few chili recipes over the years and this is by far the best chili I've ever made. In fact we're going to enter it into a local chili contest, because it was better than any we tried at the most recent cook off. I did make a few changes to the recipe. I used regular ground beef instead of ground chuck. I also used hot italian sausage instead of regular. I used two cans of chili in spicy sauce and two cans of regular chili beans. I substituted beef demi glace for the bouillon cubes and jalapeno peppers for the green chili peppers. And because my wife doesn't like green bell peppers I used an orange one instead. I also used a regular lager for the beer (Yuengling). Simmered it for 3 hours and served it with a dolop of sour cream and shredded mexican cheese on top. Instead of corn chips, we served it with beer bread that we made from a Pampered Chef recipe. It was awesome!! Not too spicy, not too sweet, just perfect!

Everyone really liked this recipe.  I only give it four stars because it wasn't the BEST chili I have ever eaten, but it's very good nonetheless.  Instead of the two green chili peppers + the diced tomatoes, I substituted rotel.  I thought this would make WAY too much chili, but it fed 8 people comfortably with leftovers.  Overall, it's a good recipe and I'll make it again.

I made it exactly except I didn't use the chili beans in spicey sauce because I couldn't find any. I just use chilli beans in regular sauce.  The chilli turned out awesome. The best I've ever had.  The cheese and fritos added a lot and I wouldn't recomend skipping on it.  Either way it was grrrrreat.

Excellent.  The only change that I made was that I forgot the tomato paste so I made it without it and I left out the celery and bell peppers because we don't like those (but doubled the onion).  Really spicy (which we love).  Otherwise, the recipe was perfect!!!

amazing!! I made it as the recipe stated. It was a bit spicy (we all had a little sweat on our foreheads!), so my only recommendation would be to add a bit less cayenne pepper or chili powder if you don't like it too spicy! Will most certainly make again...and again!

This is a fantastic chili recipe!  My husband took some to work for lunch and a couple of co-workers who tried a bite, insisted he bring some for them the next day, along with the recipe. Need I say more?

This chili was pretty good overall. I wouldn't make many changes, but it just wasn't spicy enough for my taste.  I'd make it again, but probably add a few jalapenos to the mix..

Yum!  This Chili is delish!  I don't put beans in mine, because I don't like them, so I add extra meat, onions, and peppers.

Truely awesome chili. The only thing I forgot to add was the tabasco, but it still had a nice kick to it. Would highly recommend trying this recipe. My husband absolutely loved it and wouldn't stop eating it.

Great chili recipe. Made it for a potluck and it was gone by the end of the party.  To tone down the heat for the kids I used mild chili beans, omitted the Tabasco and used 1 green chili instead of 2.

This chili is fantastic - I've made it about 1/2 dozen times in the last year and haven't changed it a bit. My husband and dad loved it but I knew they would as I consider it the perfect "Man Chili". Hearty, meaty and a good kick - it is fantastic.

My wonderful husband made chili for us last night and I never knew I liked chili until now!  It turned out fantastic!  He followed the recipe exact except for omitting the celery, doubling the bacon bits, and exchanging beer for a can of chicken broth.  It was very flavorful.  It tasted best the next day after reheating.  The day he made it he left it on low for about 5 hours and stirred it occasionally.  Again, the best chili we've ever had.

I made this exactly as it says.  I made it a day in advance and put the whole pan in the fridge overnight thinking the taste woud be better the 2nd day.  I highly recommend it!  It was even better the 3rd day.  We all put cheese, sour cream and fritos on it the 1st time but all agreed it tasted better without.

Superb chile!!  The Italian sausage really bumped up the flavor profile... along with all the other ingredients.  This was better than mine. (Sure glad I wasn't cursed with taste-buds from Texas, like that other poor guy.)

Perfect Chili!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY; no "swapped this for that" or "didn't have this so I used that" kinda stuff and it was perfect!   As I liked it so much, I've already premixed the spices so I'm ready for next time!

Great recipe - complex flavors.  Too spicy for our taste, though.  Left out the jalapeno and 1/2 tsp of the cayenne pepper and it still made me sweat when I ate it.  Otherwise, kept all the ingredients the same and we really enjoyed it. I didn't think it was too many ingredients - most of the ingredients are just teaspoons of spices from the spice cupboard that you typically already have on hand.  We'll make it again!

A++++ for this recipe. I got rave review from my family and friends. I halved the recipe, and used all ground beef instead of bulk pork, since I couldn't find any at the store. Because of that, I added a tsp of ground fennel seeds. I left out the cayenne pepper and used only 1 tbsp of chili powder to cut down on spice. It still had a kick and bold flavor. The only thing I would change for next time is omit the extra salt (it's plenty salty enough with all the other ingredients), and put less cooked onion and add raw chopped red onion as a topping (suggestion of a friend who's a chili fanatic). Definitely making this again!!!

I don't care for chilli so I made this for my husband who is a chili fanatic.  He really does think this is one of the best he has had.  He has attempted to make chili on many occassions, but tells me this recipe wins hands down :)

Recipe called for one to many things in my opinion. I like more of the basic chili but decided to try this and was disappointed. I wont be using it again.

I've made this chili a few times and it's a big hit everytime!  I did cut the amount of chili beans (I used kidney beans) in half as my family aren't really crazy about that many kidney beans :) Oh and the Fritos corn chips definitely puts this dish over the top!!

This chili is fantastic!  Its been a winner every time I've served it.  I use real bacon instead of bacon bits, and I use any dark liquor or red wine that I have in the house instead of beer.

This chili is absolutely amazing. Me and my boyfriend made it for his work chili cook off and it came in second by only one vote. Everyone that tried it absolutely loved it! We added a little bit of sour cream and cheese to each of our bowls. Soo yummy!

This is a great recipe!!  It has a nice bite but isn't "burn your face off" hot.  The only thing I did different was to leave out the hot sauce & let my guests add it to their own taste.  I like mine topped with chopped onion, cheese, & sour cream!!!

Very good. I used ground turkey and turkey sausage. Reduced the chili powder by half (hubbs doesn't like too spicy), but I did add a couple of packets of chili seasoning and increased the beer. I kept everything else the same.

Decent chili, but nothing mind-blowing.  Like some others have mentioned, seemed like an awful lot of ingredients for just an "okay" chili.

I've made this a dozen times now and its fantastic.  Here are my changes to make it healthier without sacrificing taste -
instead of ground beef use ground turkey, replace the bulk italian sausage with a package of hot italian turkey sausages.  Don't add the bacon bits they add no flavor just fat.  Eliminate the green chilies and used the diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Amazing.

Everyone loved this chili.  I didn't add Tobasco because I didn't know how hot it would be, but I will next time.  I diced everything real fine, and it wasn't a thick chili, I would think about adding 2 more cans of beans next time.

Excellent Recipe. I can't handle much heat, so I cut the cayenne in half. I served this at a pitch-in and had several people ask for the recipe.

This chili was great. Pay no attention to "Texas 2 star". He complains that this is not "authentic chili" yet he rates a breaded! chain chicken wing 5 stars. I own a restaurant in Buffalo that serves REAL wings so I can assure you he's confused about what constitutes authenticity and what tastes good.

i didnt have all the ingredients each time ive made this. i oftentimes omit the chile peppers, and use hot italian sausage instead of regular italian sausage. i also often times omit the 2 boullion cubes, the recipe has too much sodium as it is. my point though, even when i omit or change an ingredient or two or do it exactly as written, this comes out the best chili ive ever had, every time. the fritos and cheese cubes are great with it,  but i really love topping it with sliced green onions too!

I made this again for a pool tournament for 50 people yesterday. I could not find any green chili peppers so I used poblano peppers in their place. WOW what a difference in taste. Everyone that had it before said it was even better very nice flavor. The poblano peppers stood out with their one flavor very distinguishable taste. May never go back to green chilies.

This recipe it absolutely amazing!!!  I have been making this for a couple years and everyone always loves it.  I have changed the recipe a couple times.  Its the biggest hit with Hot Italian Sausage and no Chili powder, but add 1 tsp of chipotle powder.   The heat is a little smoky this way.  I also use real bacon sliced into piece and that starts the base for browning everything else.  This it AMAZING!!!!!!

This is such an awesome recipe! The great thing is that you can add or delete ingredients to your families liking. I used 2 pounds of chuck steak instead of the ground beef, black beans, mexican hot sauce instead of tobasco, an entire beer, 1/2 cup of strong coffee, brown sugar, 2 jalepenos, juice of 2 limes, handful of cilantro, and a 12 oz can of paste. Everything else we kept the same. We ate it the same day and it was fabulous...heated it up the next day and it was just as good. personally I didn't think it was any better the next day! Awesome, awesome, awesome!!

All the ingredients make for an awesome chili.  I thought it was a bit spicy first, but the cheese calms the taste down a bit.

I made this for a late October camping weekend in Minnesota, so the weather was a wee bit chilly and we needed something hot to warm us up.  This recipe definately did the trick.  I had made the chilli before we left home and then put it in the crockpot all afternoon to heat up.  It was a big hit with all the families that were camping with us that weekend.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this chili thinking it would be just another chili recipe to add to collection. Boy was I wrong! My husband asked me to never make any other chili again. As others have said it is even better the next day.

This is so very delicious because the multilayered flavors meld together so perfectly!  I used 1 1/2 lbs each of beef stew meat and ground beef along with the Italian sausage, and among the cans of chili beans I used one of the jalapeno husband pleasing beans, one of mild chili beans, and two of medium spicy (and I forgot to drain any of them).  The rest of the recipe I followed except went short on the chili powder (probably used only 3 tablespoons), and I added no salt or black pepper.  It was so very tasty!  I'll make this many times in the future!

My boyfriend and I made this one night, it was really great. We love our chili spicy so we added more peppers from his parents garden and I love beans so we added a can of pinto beans and a can of black beans. The first night we were afraid we had out spiced ourselves as it was nearly inedible because of how hot it was, but after sitting in the fridge for a night we reheated it and had it for dinner and it was amazing. My friend who is always watching her food intake even went back for seconds. The one bad thing about this recipe is that I can never eat canned chili again.

Very Tasty, I halfed the recipce cause we have a small family and I am the only one who loves chili. I was afraid of it being too hot so I only put in 1T chili powder and it was enough for my family, wasn't hot at all but made a great chili.

Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you out of making this!  It is AMAZING!!!!!  The only thing I did different was I used mild chili beans and reduced the amount of chili powder and omitted the green chilis (only because I'm a more mild fan).  Best chili I've ever had!  I do need to change the name to Fighting Irish Tailgate Chili though!  :o)

I used to make chili that was a lot simpler (about 1/2 of the ingredients) and had a lot more tomatoes. This is now my favorite chili recepie, it has a lot of spice for some people but the next day the chili is great for everyone. The flavors need time to blend. I like spicy so I like it when fresh frome the stove top, some people may need a spoon full of sour cream in thier bowl or a tall glass of water, the flavor is so good though everyone eats it anyway with thier faces sweatting the first night. Would I cut down on the peppers or chili powder? NO. If you don't like spicy then think of it as "next day chili".

Okay, I'll admit up front that I'm an Ohio State Buckeye.  So, on Saturday when was looking for a chili recipe and found this one, I was amused by the coincidence that OSU was playing Purdue that day.  My husband commented that it might be bad luck for the Buckeyes, but Purdue never beats the Buckeyes, right?  Hmmm...Purdue wins, beating a Top 10 team for the first time since 1949!  Nevertheless, the chili is great!  I doubled the recipe and omitted the bacon, but otherwise, was pretty true to Boilermaker tradition.  You Purdue fans may want to start emailing this recipe to the competition on gameday!

BTW-if you cook it in the crockpot on low for 8-12 hrs it's way better than cooking it for 2 hours. It needs time to soak up the spices. I could not find spicy chili beans or green chile peppers. Instead of just got an extra can of chili beans in mild sauce and I used 1 serrano pepper and a can of green chiles and roasted pepper flavor. I thought the recipe was actually pretty easy to prepare. I took it to a work potluck and everyone said "I don't even like chili but your chili was sooooooo good that I couldn't stop eating it....and that makes my day. Thanks for the great chili recipe. Will keep this one for sure :)

I've made this several times now. I love it and so does everyone I have made it for.  This weekend I made it for a boyscout chili cookoff and it was the first one sold out and only a few did sell out.  I did a few things different like omitting the beer (due to it being a family event) and replacing it with chicken broth. I also omitted the celery.  It is a great recipe and I will use it again. Thanks so much for sharing it with us.

I havnt made to much chili in my 21 years but this one tops it all! I LOVE the different types of veggies (red/green peppers and Celery) Adds alot of color to it...I did make a few changes of course--- --Was running out of room in my crock pot so put 2 cans of dark kidney beans and 1 can of spicy chili beans --Took another reviewers suggestion, cooked my own bacon then sauteed HALF of the onions and celery in the grease along with the garlic --The meat I browned all together in a large pot using mild italian sausage squeezed out of its casing, drained well then I rinsed extra well in warm water (I dont like a greasy chili) Next time I think I will also add a little water once drained and rinsed and season for a while with some chili spices ---I also left out Tabasco and any other spicy pepper (I do not like spicy foods!)  ---A very flavorful chili, I served with homemade cornbread muffins as well  I plan on making this Chili again doubling the recipe to make a very spicy version and my mild one for my baby shower in a month.

I think this turned out really well!  It is a long list of ingredients, but I put the spices together the day before just to save time and energy.  I'm also a fan of mise en place, so I gathered EVERYTHING together before getting started so as to not have to fall over a cat or dog while scurrying around.  Changes include:  1) Used 3 cans of plain old red kidney beans, drained and rinsed (don't like tinny flavor). 2) Added red pepper flakes to make up for lack of "spicy sauce" in beans. 3) No bacon 4) No bouillon 5) Full bottle of beer (corsenbach) 6) Saute onion separately in small skillet. 6.5) Softened peppers and celery, then added meat to brown. 7) Moved meat mixture and everything else to slow cooker and cooked on low for about 6 hours. Awesome!

Great Chili!  I will probably use this recipe when I enter a chili cook off later this fall.  My folks thought it was a bit spicy, but that is expected with them.  The wife likes to put sour cream in it when served.  I only added one ingredient not mentioned in the recipe, which was 2-3 tablespoons of dark brown sugar.  Only because I really like the contradicting sweet/spicy flavors.

I changed this recipe some with the veggies I used, canned beans (used chili and kidney) and used turkey and johnsons bratwurst, but followed the spices per the recipe and I loved it.  I make a lot of chili and am pretty particular about the taste of my chili, this one's a keeper and maybe the replacement of my "go to chili"!

I did not put the cayenne pepper or the can of spicy beans in this chili because I was scared that it was too hot.  I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I added in way more than what the recipe said.  The secret to this chili is to let it simmer for a while.  I made this at night and when I went to bed I left the pot of chili out to cool off.  In the morning it was totally different and better tasting.  This recipe is too big for 2 people, so I ended up freezing a bunch of it.

There are NO flaws in this recipe.  Such an easy one to make and the flavor is unparalleled.  Spicy but still maintains terrific flavor.  We topped ours with Mexican cheese!  This recipe also makes A LOT of chili so be prepared to fill a large crockpot and have leftovers...maybe. :)

This was amazing chili. It was some work chopping and whatnot but it was fun and definitely worth it. I made it just as written except I used 3 large jalapenos in a HALF batch to make it extra spicy. I also added a little extra chili powder when I was browning the meat. This was the first chili recipe where I didn't have to reach for extra chili powder after it was cooked - everything was perfect! My husband said this was his favorite homemade chili he's ever had and he wouldn't just say that if he didn't mean it! Try this one!!! If you make a whole batch I hope you have a BIG pot. This makes quite a bit.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  Except I didn't add celery (not a fan of cooked celery and didn't see how it would add to the flavor).  It was so full of flavor and I thought the consistancy was perfect.  When I think of awesome chili - I think of this!

Very good! I made according to recipe. After the 2 hour simmer I tasted and added a bit more salt, pepper and couple shakes of chili powder. Let is simmer for probably about 4 hours total before serving. Served with fritos, cheddar cheese and reduced fat sour cream. This was not a "chunky" chili, so I will keep my other chili recipe on hand when we are in the mood for a hearty, chunky chili, and this one for a "thinner" chili day. Yum!

I just made this yesterday for a chili cookoff we held at work.  Out of 10 entries I won 1st!  I made it pretty much as the recipe said, but I did use about 1/2 lb of bacon and cooked it with the rest of the meat.  I also couldn't find the spicy chili beans so I used a different kind of flavored bean, and I used light kidney beans.  I let it simmer for about 5 hours, then reheated in a crockpot.  Very good - not too spicy.

i followed this recipe exactly, except I left out the hot pepper sauce and cayenne pepper since I have 3 young children. I added a 4 oz can of diced green chiles instead. My family loved it! I have been given many chili recipes over the years but this one is by far the best. Thanks for sharing!

We were looking for a chili cookoff receipe and tried this one.  We made it & took samples to 6 people to taste & give feedback.  They all said overall..."average".  Everyone thought it was too thick--more like a casserole, too sweet (probably because of the bell peppers--even tho we cut back on them) & too strong of a bell pepper taste. One person said it tasted almost bitter the next day and had too many beans.  We agreed with all the comments.  Not our kind of chili but then I think chili is one of those dishes that you like more particularly a certain way.

Lots of ingredients but well worth the time and effort. Made this for Superbowl and it was fabulous. Tripled the batch using all hamburger instead of sausage and it almost filled a 22-quart slow cooker.  I browned the meat, onions, bell peppers and celery before adding to the slow cooker and it cooked all night long - about 12 hours total.  Soaked three dried chili peppers in beer, then chopped them and added to the chili. Instead of adding the hot sauce to the chili, I served it on the side with chopped jalapeno peppers, cheese, and chopped onions.  This is a keeper!!

Um... Only the BEST chili EVER! I wish I could give it 10 stars! Seriously it really is so good! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I had to change was the meat. I used 2 lbs cubed chuck roast instead of ground.(that's what my butcher had. He cut a roast in small cubes) but I still also used 1 lb of Italian sausage. And another thing, I used 4 slices cooked bacon instead of bacon bits. I also cooked everthing in my crockpot. I first browned the cubed chuck in a skillet just to sear the outsides enough to keep the juices in.     Then cooked the sausage and bacon and threw everything in the crockpot and put it on low. I let it cook pretty much all day then warmed it up the next day! Its SO yummy! The chuck cubes just fall apart in your mouth! I will never use another recipe again!! Thank you SO much for this fabulous chili! Yay!

By far and away the BEST chili I've ever tasted.  I think the secret is having all the veggies go in raw to stew and release all their flavors.  Not only does everyone in my family LOVE this chili, but I can't count how many times I've been asked for the recipe! And not only while it was being enjoyed, but now I've become known for "my" chili, and get frequent requests out of the blue for the recipe.  I always give credit to Purdue though, and tell them that I got this "tailgate chili" recipe from Allrecipes on the internet!  I also mention that I leave out the hot sauce and find it spicy enough with the jalapeno and cayenne.  This is NOT trying to be an "authentic" or traditional chili recipe, but it is absolutely DELICIOUS according to the hundreds of people I've served it to...

This was an excellent Chili that I made for last year's Super Bowl party.  Because it does have a bit of bite, I toned it down a little for those who can't take it.  *Changed the name too... Not a Purdue/Purdon't fan.

This Chili is really good.  There are so many layers of flavor.  I followed the recipe with only one minor change, I add a whole bottle of beer (did not want to throw the rest down the drain).  I did not know what type of green chili to add to the chile, so I decided on an poblano chile pepper and what a great choice.

This recipe has a fantastic flavor.  It is just right.  Both my husband and I loved it.  I made this for New Year's Day and like a previous reviewer, prepared only 5 servings, but had a lot left over, and we ate several meals on it.  I substituted ground turkey breast for the ground beef and it tasted great.  My husband did not even know I made the substitution.  I did not add all tasbasco sauce as I felt it was spicy enough as it was, and I like fairly spicy food.  This will be my chili recipe going forward.

This recipe is okay but not as good I expected based on all the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon bits (because I didn't have any)and I found it to be way to salty - I cant imagine how salty it would have been if I ate my bowl with corn chips as the recipe recommended. Next time I think I will leave out some of the bouillon and see if that helps. It's a good base though.

After reading a bunch of the reviews and most were a 5 star, I have to admit I am disappointed with the chili. I thought it would be the bomb, but instead it was a total dud. I followed the recipe to the tee and entered the company chili contest feeling pretty good after all the reviews. My chili came in dead last. Not the outcome I was hoping for. I have been cooking for years and just won our soup comp last month, so I am not a rookie cook.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe due to personal tastes. I took out the Worcestershire sauce, bacon, and beer. I also used only 1 lb. of beef and had to substitute dried crushed chili pepper since I couldn't find any fresh. My friends and family loved it, including my ever-picky sister. I'm requested to make it all the time, and I always make extra to freeze for a "chili" day.

I have been searching for a good chili recipe for the longest time, . . . well this one is it!  No offense, but I didn't even look at the main ingredients in this, I just wanted the spices and flavorings.  I make my chili with half turkey chopped meat and half beef chopped meat, and LOTS of different beans, also fresh peppers and onions.  That is just the way I like it, but these spices are to DIE FOR!!!!!   LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  Thank you so much! :)

Very good chili.  I did tweak it a little, but the base of it was the same. I also added corn to the chili which made it a little sweeter.  Yum.

Wow, I have been in a bit of an unofficial chili making contest with a friend for a while and I think I won last night!  As we only had 5 for dinner I halved the recipe and used only beef as that is what I had. Some of us are not so fond of very hot food, but enjoy a little zing so I made it with ordinary red kidney beans and left out the tabasco and limited the other chili elements, let it simmer for a while, divided it into 2 pots and added the called for chili to one pot and put both pots in the oven to simmer away at 100C all afternoon.  Both sides enjoyed their dinner!

Pretty good chili, but nothing special--I was expecting more based on reading other reviews.  I omitted the tabasco and cayenne pepper and added jalapenos instead.

I halved the recipe. It still made a lot. It wouldn't fit in my crock pot so I put it on the stove top for a couple hours. Watch out if you dont stir it often. Some of it got stuck to the bottom of the pot. I added bacon and used the drippings to saute the vegetables.

I do replace one of the cans of chili beans with kidney beans and I also add 
3 or 4 chopped smoked andouille sausage.

Wow, this chili was good! It had a mild, gentle heat, so the kids could eat it too. Like some other reviewers, I cooked my own bacon, and then sauteed the veggies in some of the drippings. I also cut up my own chuck roast instead of using ground, and browned that first too. I put everything in a crock pot (mine is 7 quarts, and it was FULL), and cooked on low for 8 hours. I used one can each of kidney, pinto, and black beans for the "chili beans", and one can of "ranch-style beans" for the beans with chili sauce. I also didn't know I was so low on cumin, so I didn't have very much in there, but with all the other flavors going on, I didn't miss it! I will definitely make this one again.

Absolutely amazing. I didnt change a thing about it. My wife and daughter LOVE it. If my daughter had her way it would be spicer, she adds a ton of hot sauce to it. Crazy 6 year old. I make a double batch of it and when friends find out I made chili it doesnt last long

Holy freaken cow is this good!!  How can it not be, considering how many yummy ingredients there are.  Definitely make sure you cook this long enough so your veggies are tender, but other than that, you really cannot go wrong here!  This recipe took all of the elements from my usual chili recipe, but had a whole lot extra.  Will certainly make this again.

I made this for the Michigan Vs. Ohio State game party that I have every year.  It was awesome.  I had so many compliments.  I now use it for my chili recipe.  It's wonderful.

This was the best recipe for chili that I have found. I made it and my husband raved about it and he is very hard to please. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe....

My son was just accepted to Purdue and by coincidence, I found this receipe.  To celebrate, I made this.  My husband said it was by far the best batch of chili.  I did make some adjustments so here they are:
1 40 oz can each of Hot and Mild Chili Beans; 1/4 cup chopped jalapeno's peppers; 1/2 cup cider vinegar; soy bacon bits; Italian turkey sausage instead of pork sausage; ground sirloin; lots more spices including 1 tablespoon cumin, oregano, basil, cayenne, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder.  Yum!

Fabulous, this recipe now belongs to me.
Challenge to anyone that can find more 5 star reviews than this one. And there where many reviews that deviated from the original recipe.  There was an occasional poo poo from Texas because of beans, but they make chili like they play foorball. I had to dial back on the hot beans and chiles and used beef loin cubes and it was still plenty bold. I would suggest folks not underestimate the bacon componet. Nothing can go wrong with enough bacon.

THANK YOU !!

Very good chili. I simmered it all day. It got better with every bite. Next time I will add dry mustard, milk chocolate, and brown sugar.

Wow! I think this is the best Chili out there!! 
I made this for a fall bonfire Oct 2007, and also made a pot of Baked Potato Soup..  both I tripled in size.. there was not one drop of chili left- I was happy it was loved but sad no left overs!
My husband raved and even raved the next day!
Please when making this.. do not alter... there is a reason it is rated so high-- make it the exact way.. every flavor and ingredient is complimentary of each other.. 
It does seem like alot of ingredients but definitely well worth it..  if you want to make a great chili that will be everyones favorite.. then make this chili.. the best!!!! Yum!

I have always just made chili and never followed a recipe. This was great! I didn't have the red or green sweet peppers, or the celery, other than that I followed the recipe. It was even better the next day! It had just the right amount of heat for my family! Only my daughter who could eat fire, added more hot sauce to it.

Simmer for at least the two hours though!

Oh wow this was good. I did absoulutely every thing according to the recipe and my husband deemed it the best chili I have ever made (and I've tried a bunch of them!) The kids weren't crazy about it because it was too spicy for them so I think next time we will be spliting it into two pots and not including so much hot in to one of them. But for us adults it was perfect!

Another 5 star review!  1st Place out of 8 in a friendly chili cook-off yesterday.  Only changes I made:  I used actual bacon (about 6 strips).  1 large habanero pepper (instead of 2 chiles), 3 cloves of garlic. Common comment was: it was the most balanced.  I cooked it the night before, refrigerated and reheated.  It lost much of its heat, but a slight tingle in the aftertaste.  I thought it was a tiny bit strong with the chili powder flavor.  Next time I will back the chili powder down to 3 tblspn and kick up the heat from another source (another habanero or other chili peppers - maybe spicy italian sausage - maybe wasabe!).  Awesome recipe >>  make it your own.

This was the best chili !!!  Great for left overs and for chilidogs!! Tastes even better the next day.  I thought it would be too spicy for me, but decided to try it first without changing a thing, it was not too spicy, my kids even liked it.  My husband was raving about it. Made some killer garlic bread with it.  Yum.  Getting ready to make it for the 2nd time and looking forward to chilidogs for work lunches.

I have been making this chili for a few years now - it's become our number one go to chili. I like that it makes a ton so I can freeze some for later consumption.

This is a really really good chili recipe.  Its got a nice kick to it and has to be toned down for anyone that doesnt like spice, but the fresh veggies give this chili a very nice crunch and taste.  Also not at all soupy... a real man's chili.

This was the best chili I have ever had.  My husband loved it and we have enough to last us a week.  Was definitely spicy (I left out 1 jalapeno and it was still hot!)  Other than that didn't change a thing.

This chili is amazing.  It takes some time to make, but it's totally worth it.  I make the whole batch for my husband and me, and we eat as much as we want and freeze the rest.  It's really good thawed out of the freezer too.

SOOOOO Good! I used a poblano pepper, and chipotle flavored Tabasco sauce. I cut the recipe in half and only used 1 can of beans though. Other than that I made the recipe pretty much as given.  This is the best Chili recipe I have found on this site!

Turned out great!  Great flavor!  My husband loved this, and he usually doesn't like chili because of all the beans.  I skipped the celery and used turkey bacon because that's what I had.  Also used leaner ground beef.  Made it the night before and heated in the crock pot the day of.  Great recipe!!!

I usually make chili using a packet from the grocery store. This was an extremely easy recipe to follow and a hit with my family. Only change was that I used an entire bottle of Corona, and eyeballed the spices. A wonderful recipe for sure.

This is absolutely the best chili I have ever had.  My family likes a little milder chili, so I used a large poblano chili pepper that I roasted and I used a whole can of beer.  It takes a little more prep time, but it is well worth the effort

This chili is great!! Usually I am a fan of Cincinnati Chili, we wanted a hearty chili. This will be my only hearty chili recipe! It is very flavorful. I didn't add the Tabaso, as kids were eating. Eveyone added it on thier own. Great over Fritoes, cheese and sour cream. A MUST MAKE RECIPE!

I have never made chili before in my life...but last night I made this recipe for today's office potluck. It was a huge success and no one believed that I've never made chili before. As a side note, I work with a bunch of fire chiefs who really know good chili. So I highly recommend this recipe.

Disappointed after all the hype... I followed this recipe exactly except for the 1/2 cup of beer as I didn't have any around.  For the extensive amount of ingredients involved, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  It has a lot of "bite", if that's what you're looking for, but I prefer bite and a rich flavor as well.  I have a much better chili recipe that is also from scratch that is actually worth all the prep time that I will stick with unless I find one better...

I made this chili for halloween and my friends and family raved about it!  EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  I omitted the celery (because I don't like it), cayene pepper, and hot sauce (for the kids sake)and it was still pretty spicy.  I also added a TBL of sugar instead of a tsp.  Definately try this one!!

I made this last night and I am very impressed.  The only thing I left out was the bacon because I forgot to buy it.  I also did not have any jalapenos so I used a can of diced green chiles.  This was sooooooo good and it made a ton.  It was even better today at lunch!!  This is my new chili recipe. My husband loved it!

This was phenomenal chili. Don't know that it needed the bacon bits, but would be hesitant to change anything. Perfect amount of spice and rich, complex flavor. Comfort food when needed after my MSU Spartans lose, again.

Yum...I used 1 1/2 lb of hamburger and 1 lb of ground pork along with mild italian sausage.  Also used sweet smoked paprika and cut down on the tasbasco and cayenne powder.  Will have to cut back a bit more on those when I make it the next time, since my family still thought it was too spicy. Wonderful combination of flavors.

This chili takes a looooong time to make (at least it did for me but i'm a slow cook) but it was worth it.  Don't try to do this recipe in a dutch oven - not quite big enough, but everybody that tried it and could stand some heat liked it...even for breakfast! It was a too hot for my girlfriend. I think this is probably a little too hot for the average chili eater, but for ones who don't mind heat, it's perfect!

I took out some of the things that made this spicy.  This was oa=kay chili but way too much work and resources for just okay chili.  I will not make this again.  It sure makes a lot.

This was loved by everyone.  Chili was always so so in our house, but I never added beer before and I think that was the key ingredient.  It was amazing, I didn't change a thing.

BEST CHILI I HAVE EVER HAD! That's saying a lot, since I've eaten a lot of chilis. This is so much better than the chilis that you order at restaurants boasting "best chili in _insert city name here_" This chili packs a punch, so if you have GERD, this is not for you... I cut down the chili powder to 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon of hot sauce and it was still spicy, but tolerable. I added 1 cup of beer, omitted Worcestershire (didn't have it) and paprika (in my opinion, paprika adds only color and no flavor). This is probably the most complete chili recipe you'll ever come across. This is really, truly excellent. Perfect over rice, on buns, on noodles... the possibility is endless. I'm sure it freezes well and will still retain its heavenly taste reheated, but I have a feeling you won't have leftovers for long.

Very good, I customized it a bit the way I wanted it- I left the sausage out and didn't add beans.  It was yummy.  For those that don't want it to spicy- just cut down on the tabasco,paprika, & spycy beans ..(kind of a no brainer).  Tasted great!!

Very tasty! ...Made this exactly as written for Father's Day...everyone loved it...my parents even came back the next day to finish off the leftovers for lunch. As suggested by another reviewer, I served this with Homesteader Cornbread from this site...it was also a huge hit.

This is probably the best red chili recipe I've come across.  Just excellent, makes a huge batch and while not bad when first made, really tastes great the next day.  Sour cream, green onions and cheddar went on top to finish off the bowls.  Everyone enjoyed it--thanks for the recipe.

Wow!! I changed it up a little, but it was fantastic!! I left out the peppers, oregano, and celery (personal preference), but did add 2 sliced jalapenos. I also used 1# spicy Italian sausage, 1.5# beef, 1 cup beer, and 4 fully drained cans of dark red kidney beans. For the canned tomatoes, I used 4 cans of Rotel: 1 extra hot, 1 original, and 2 chili fixins. If you like a HOT and SPICY chili with a kick, this will certainly do it!

Fabulous!!! There are a lot of ingredients in this recipe but all of them are worth it. I omitted the beer, Worceshire, and bacon bits but it was still fabulous. Also, I used the diced tomatoes with the green chiles in it-worked very well. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box.

I have been using the same chili recipe for years (basically from the back of a seasoning package) and I finally decided I can do better. My niece is at Purdue right now so OF COURSE I am going to give this one a whirl! Well, I now have a new go to chili recipe!! Of course I modified it, it's chili!! Here are my take aways...the sausage, beer, worcestershire, tabasco and seasonings are a must, I did go easy on the cumin. I also used fresh garlic. Mine went in the crock pot and cooked all day. Since this has thousands of 5 star ratings and comments, I am sure no one will find this review but who cares :).  The name drew me to the recipe and from now on I will make chili the Boiler Maker way! Boiler UP!!

This turned out to be one of the worst chilis I've ever made.Overall, it was way too sweet for me.  I have a sweet tooth, but I don't like super sweet chili.  I would completely eliminate the sugar, even though it is very little.  Also, ensure you don't get flavored chili beans that may have extra sugar.  I used chunks of beef chuck instead of ground beef chuck (more because I did that with the last chili I made and it turned out amazing).

I just won 1st place at work for our Annual Chili Cook Off!! Yay!! Great recipe!  I did omit the hot pepper sauce...didn't want it overly spicy.  It had great kick at the end. Awesome!

This is the best chili! I use poblano peppers as a sub for chili peppers, the flavor is amazing!

I just made this and followed it almost exactly. I modified the beans a bit to what I had on hand. This is an excellent chili and I will make this again.

I've made this about 3 times now, always doing things slightly different (because I always forget something or don't have time for everything), but it's always been crazy delicious! SUPER flavorful with just the right amount of spice. My husband LOVES it with sour cream, cheese, and tortilla chips. I'm making it again tonight for a friend! :)

I started using recipe years ago! It's a staple in my house. It is by far the best chili EVER! We like heat so only change I make is leaving the seeds in the jalapeño! VIOLA!

EXCELLENT!! Best chili my family has had!! I follow the recipe exactly, and it comes out perfect every time! My picky 4 year old LOVES it too!! This is actually the only chili he will eat, and will specifically ask me to make it.  This chili is also great to make ahead and freeze.

This is the best chili I've ever had much less ever made.  I used 1/2 lb of spicy chicken sausage instead of 1 lb regular sausage, Medium spicy chili beans instead of spicy, and real bacon instead of bacon bits.  Other than that stayed pretty true to the recipe.  My husband thought it could use a few more beans but I disagreed.  It definitely had some spice but I can't take things above Medium spicy and I thought this was perfect and not overdone.  Such a winner and definitely better a day later!

The best & easiest chili! I followed recipe except for the huge cans of beans - making for two & it still makes a lot. I had to eliminate the hot seasonings. But good & easy...the best!!! Oh & I freeze some. I love this & have shared this recipe with friends & family.

After combing recipes for chili, I landed here. I made this chili this morning (2/1/2015) to enjoy with my fiancé during the Super Bowl game. This recipe nailed it!  I followed the recipe almost exactly--did not use Italian sausage or the bacon bits--ONLY because my guy does not like either. I would love to try it with the Italian sausage because I love them. I've never made a recipe that did not require something else, e.g, more salt, pepper, etc. This recipe was on the money! My guy is already looking forward to the next batch!

This is great, but I did not follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have bullion, so I omitted it. I can't eat pork, so I omitted the bacon as well.  Doesn't matter,  it is wonderful.

Love this chili recipe and have made it many times.  I follow it as cloaely as possible assuming i have all the ingredients.  One thing i have done instead of bacon bits is use freshly cooked bacon instead, and also without when i had none on hand.  The fresh bacon really does make a difference in overall flavor and i recommend it if you can   Thanks for such a great recipe!

For a family friendly version, I left out the beer, chili peppers, cayenne, and tabasco. It still had plenty of amazing flavors! To substitute for the beer, I didn't drain the beans and added 1 cup of water. Excellent

great recipe. I don't use the hot peppers or cayane as the chili powder and hot sauce make it hot enough. I also added a herseys chocolate bar to a doubled recipe that adds a great undertone of flavor which I think is great.

We've been enjoying this recipe for a few years, with some tweaks for our tastes. Outstanding!  I usually place everything (meat previously browned) in the slow cooker on Low all day so that dinner is ready when we are.

(Use 2 lbs. Deer Burger) - This Chili Recipe is absolutely AWESOME!!  It takes a lot of different ingredients but it is worth the wait in preparing it.   We made it with Lean Ground Deer Burger instead of using ground chuck.  Just right for Cold Weather...

Quite good! Great thing about chili is that you can adjust to your personal tastes. As is this chili is a bit too spicy for me (and I like spicy stuff). The only thing I did differently was use ground turkey in place of the beef and it came out great!

I liked this recipe. Of course I messed around with it and checked out some other reviews for tips. I added zucchini, mushrooms, corn and used 4 different types of beans (chick, pinto, red kidney and black). I had a bad cold when I ate this flavourful chili, that's a testament to how good it really is. My pregnant wife loved it too!

This is the BEST chili recipe out there!  The number of ingredients might steer some people away, but all of them bring the flavors together.  I've been making this for years and can't agree more with other reviewers who suggest refrigerating overnight and then heating the next day.  The flavors really meld together.  I've modified the recipe just a bit and wanted to share - I substitute ground beef with cube steak, use 2-3 slices of real bacon and sauté all of the vegetables in the leftover grease.  I also tone down the spices of the beans to medium and mild and add spice at the end.  I also add a little dark chocolate in there, which is a trick  my mom always did growing up!  Can't say enough good things about this recipe - enjoy!!!

Great recipe! I followed some of the adjustments recommended by other reviewers, and I got tons of compliments on it tonight. Here they are: 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground hot pork Italian sausage, and 1 lb sweet Italian turkey sausage. I did 2 cans of mild chili beans instead of 3, and one hot. I omitted the Tabasco sauce since I added the spicy sausage, and did one seeded jalapeño instead of the green chilies. I crumbled in 4 strips of bacon instead of bacon bits, and cooked the veggies in the bacon grease before adding them to the meat. Oh, and I used brown sugar instead of white. This was a huge hit, most people had second, if not third helpings. I will definitely make it again, and recommend making this recipe. It's kind of a long process with a lot of ingredients, but it's totally worth it. Yum!

I did not care for this chili. This is similar to spaghetti sauce. Served it at Texas A&M game this past week, was asked "where's the pasta?"

I've made my own chili concoction for as long as I remember and have never strayed from that...until now!  This recipe was a bit daunting at first due to the plethora of ingredients but as I read thru them I realized I already had most of them.  I substituted the Italian pork sausage for Italian style turkey sausage (because it was on sale), sub'd the celery stalks for celery seed (not a fan of celery)and used canned green chilies because I couldn't find the fresh ones in the store.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out more delicious that I imagined.  My family really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again in the future.

OMG!  Have been using the same chili recipe for years and wanted to do something different.  This was amazing!  MY husband and our friends loved it.  I read a few other reviews and used the 4 slices of bacon as opposed to the bacon bits and I cooked it the night before I needed to serve it.  This is my new go to chili recipe!

I have made this chili for tailgating in MN.  Its cold here, and this spicy chili warms everyone up! I always keep the spices the same, but have played around with the veggies (have added carrots, different kinds of peppers, etc..).  My go-to recipe when hosting a tailgate or football party.

This is the best chili by far I have ever had! Sorry mom! I follow the recipe almost exactly, but I leave out the celery, and sometimes I substitute the ground beef for ground turkey for a healthier take. It's a lot of ingredients, but well worth it! It really is better after it sits, and even better the next day so if you have time make it the day before and put in the crock pot the next day to reheat :-)

Love this chili recipe. I did use only mild chili beans since I am a weeny when it comes to spicy foods. I topped it with sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream. This is now a staple recipe in my house!

This is awesome. I doctored it a little with some extra ground beef and two cans of kernel corn and I added 3/4 cup of water to let the veggies (especially the peppers) have time to cook. But all in all it has an amazing bite that isnt too much. well done!! im excited to make this again. and for all the people who hate chopping, it took me about 20 mins to cut all the veg listed. its great! also i didnt add paprika because i didnt have any and i omitted the salt, the bullion takes care of it. love it!!

My family loves this chili! We skip the sugar, beef bouillon and beer by choice, but have tried the original recipe and like it very much.  We also use cooked tomatoes from the garden in place of canned ones and tomato paste.

Excellent chili with a variety of layers of flavor.  I crisped up 2 slices of bacon and used that fat to sweat the onions and peppers.  Also used a whole bottle of lager.  Nice heat in the background.

This recipe is Awesome. The only things that I change on it is I substitute is roasted Anheim peppers instead of the chili peppers. Also I use a dark porter beer in it. We usually use 1/2 spicy Italian and 1/2 mild sausage.

This makes a good bowl of chili.  Great on a chilly day with the family. The only things I can add to this is not to cook it too long or the meat will turn mushy.  A one hour simmer is just right.  The onions and peppers need to be sautéed.  I did think it needed something else so I added 3 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce.  Now its just right.

Made this for dinner last night and found it to be very tasty and just the right amount of heat for a "general" audience of eaters. I would have given it 5 stars but the recipe lacked what I will call Pizzazz. I followed the recipe to the letter with the ingredients and amounts and just thought it lacked something to take it over the top. Don't get me wrong, this Chili is excellent in flavor and texture, but just doesn't make me wanna shout about it. I guess I'm still upset about losing my chili recipe that I used for years that was worth shouting about. I've been trying to replace it, and this recipe comes close, but can't replace "Glen's 5-Alarm Chili". I'll keep looking, and until I find it I'll keep using this one for chili!

Just won the Chili Cookoff at work today with this recipe!!  Only thing I did different was to use a bottom round roast instead of the ground beef.  I braised the roast then put in the crockpot until tender.  I cut it in small pieces and still used the ground sausage.  Everything else was the same.  Everyone loved it! I think it has the perfect amount of heat.

This chili is rather good.  I don't know that it is the best chili I've ever had but it is right up there with the best I've ever made and I've experimented quite a bit.  It would be very spicy if made as written.  I cut down the spice by leaving out the Tabasco, using a can of medium beans and cutting the chili powder down to 3 tablespoons and it still had quite a kick.  Other changes I made:  3 cans of total beans versus 4, real bacon instead of bits, the entire can of beer (just cuz it was too early to drink the rest) and for the meat I used, 1 lb of stew meat, 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb of chicken thighs (don't wrinkle your nose - it's good!).  After browning and sautéing where appropriate, I simmered for 2 1/2 hours on the stove, poured into my slow cooker and refrigerated all night.  I put the slow cooker on low heat about 6 hours before dinner the next day and like I said it was very good.  I thought it was going to be too soupy and it could have been a little thicker but it was fine.  Probably more of a 4 1/2 star but since I've eaten better chili, I can't give it 5.  Next time I make this and I will, I will cut the cayenne back to 1/2 a teaspoon and add 14 ounces less tomatoes.  Depending on the time I might take a couple swigs of the beer before I pour it in.

I've tried a new top recipe for seven days and this is the best so far.

Soooooooo good!  I add less beans then called for only because my family doesn't care for them, I also omit the sugar.  I use fresh pepper bacon from the butcher, about 6 slices, and a small steak cut into small pieces.  A little red wine makes for a rich flavor also.  DEF DEF DEF taste after its simmered for a while because I usually end up adding more chili powder and boullion...maybe a few other ingredients as well, but I tend to like very full flavored dishes.  It's definitely a great starter recipe for Chili that can easily be customized to your taste.  I like to use a Stout beer....richer flavor.

This recipe was great!! I made some modifications to make it on the healthier side and my fiancé (who is a chili guru, couldn't get enough so I knew the modifications were golden!!) 

Modifications: 
3 lbs lean turkey instead of the chuck & sausage 
1 piece of turkey bacon instead of bacon bits 
Light beer 
Xylitol sweetener instead of sugar 

It came out AMAZING!!!!

Woweee! Even my wife, who is not particularly a chili fan, loved this chili. OK, I must confess that I used this recipe to the tee for a chili cookoff with my fellow faculty and staff. Out of 8 chili's that were entered, this recipe took the prize by a longshot. They said that second place wasn't even close. So...thank you for a wonderful recipe, and if I could send you the trophy, I would. At least I mentioned to a few of the contestants that I "borrowed" the recipe. 

What great depth this chili had! So many unique flavors and textures, it truly was darn close to the best chili I've ever tasted, and I'm almost 50! This recipe is staying in my recipe box...

Loved this Chili. Great flavors. About to make it for the second time.
I cut back just a little on some of the spices (for my taste)but other than that followed the recipe to a T.

I love this chili, my family loves this chili.  I followed the recipe, minus the hot peppers and cayenne (small children in the house).  I am making this for the 2nd time today.  This is excellent as leftovers or made the day ahead.  No need to freeze any because everyone wanted more when the leftovers were gone.  Make it, you will not be sorry :-)

Make it all the time.  Hubby says I need to cut the heat....NOT GONNA HAPPEN!  Perfect just the way it is.  Tried once replacing beef/sausage with chicken.....just as good.  And it was just leftover from a store bought rotisserie!

As is, this chili is a little too spicy for a family with young children.  I cut paprika, cayenne, chili powder, and chili pepper in half and was still spicy, but not over the top so my children could eat it.  After that, we all loved it.

I have made this so many times. It is a great recipe! Everywhere I have taken it, people love it. I cook it with the lid off the last hour or so because I like my chili thick! I use meatloaf mix for the meat. Also, I don't use the bacon bits. Otherwise, I follow the recipe.

Added green chilli instead of diced pepper, simmered in crock pot all day. Fabulous recipe! Served with a dab of plain Greek yogurt on top.

I made this chili to compete in a cook-off and I won 1st place.  Granted I was the only contestant, but everyone raved about how good it was!  I am only giving it 4 stars because there were a couple of draw backs: First, it took a really long time to prep.  Second, you NEED to use an extra large stew pot. Trust me on this one, you will regret it otherwise.  Third, it cost me over $25 to make because of the cut of meat so if you are looking to save some cash use 75-80% lean ground beef instead.  Overall, a great chili.  Enjoy!

LOVE this chili.  I make this just about every saturday for sunday lunch.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to make it the day before and slow cook the day after.  I substitute hickory salt for the salt and 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke for the bacon bits.  Gives it a nice bbq kind of finish.  Favorite chili.

Wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

1/15/14 update: This is an excellent chili recipe with layers of interesting flavors. As an added bonus, this recipe is very forgiving! I made a few changes because I didn't have everything. Substituted:  italian turkey links for beef bulk sausage, garbanzo and black beans instead of chili beans, (adding all the juices from the beans),  Catalina salad dressing for tomato paste, Onion powder instead of onion, Chipotle powder instead of peppers. Omitted: dried oregano,  Tabasco, cayenne pepper, celery and beer.

I made this for our volunteer firemen's ice dive weekend rescue drill. Several men wanted to know who made it. It was a big hit, no leftovers. Recipe requested by one of the wives.  I used a scant half teaspoon of cayenne and 2 small cans of chopped green chili peppers and followed everything else as written. Will definitely make this again.

Love this chili! Make it for my husband and his family every year when they go hunting. It freezes well and they can thaw it out and reheat it around the campfire. I'm always told it's one of the best dinners of the week. Occasionally when using this recipe, I make modifications with the meat and use venison. I also throw in a handful of frozen corn on hand if I have it.

After reading reviews, I decided to make this recipe, although I was concerned about some of the reviews that called this bland.  HARDLY! The flavor is complex and delicious!  Because I was worried about the bland factor, I made only a few small changes - 1)I used a combination of chipotle chili powder, ancho chili powder and regular chili powder.  2) I used one chili pepper and one jalapeno pepper.  3)Used a whole bottle of beer.  4) Used one can of chili beans in mild sauce and one in hot sauce and didn't add any more (my family's not too big on beans).  Amazing!!  And worth the effort!

I'm sorry but I really did not like this chili. It has way too many ingredients, and is very expensive, and did not taste good in my opinion.  It did not have a normal chili taste, and I added everything exactly as described, except cooked in a large crockpot overnight after browning the meats separately on the stove.  I actually prefer my own chili or my mother's.  Maybe it is a regional preference, but I won't make this again. I was very disappointed, had to add a packet of chili seasoning from the store just to make edible.

I make it practically the same way EXCEPT I take out the sausage and add Chorizo for a better flavor and kick.  I also add some stew meat to the ground beef which makes this a meaty bowl of chili!

Fantastic! I switched out some of the beans-only used 1can of red kidney, 1can of black beans, 1 can  of red kidney in a garlic, pepper sauce(couldn't find "spicy chili beans") I also used hot Italian sausage.  Everything else the same.  My husband says its the best chili! Even better than his moms.  :-)

I've tried another chili recipe from this site in the past and wasn't a fan of it.  This chili tastes almost exactly like the one my grandmother used to make.  This recipe makes a lot, my crockpot couldn't hold it all.  I did make a few changes according to user reviews, and I made two pots, one spicy (crockpot), one mild (stovetop), omitting celery, instead of all chili beans I used 2 cans of dark kidney beans, used bacon instead of bacon bits, and a bottle of beer (Sam Adams Boston Lager), brown sugar instead of white; sauteed onions and green peppers first.  Like my chili meaty so used 3 lbs. of ground beef chuck.  Refrigerated overnight and served the next day.

So amazing. Made exactly as directed, no substitutes. It does take a lot of time to make, but the effort is worth it. I froze half of it and when I thawed it and reheated it later it was just as good, if not better! This recipe is a real winner. One of my faves from the site.

I think this recipe has way too much Tomato. Also, the beans don't need to cook for 2 hours. They are likely already cooked in the can. Put them in about 30 minutes before the chili is done. Otherwise they are likely to be mush.

This was the best chili I have ever made! Even my mom liked it a lot and it is extremely rare that she would have no criticisms to make about someone else's food! The only changes I made were that I used beefcubes instead of sausage, about two thirds of a 12 oz bottle of bud light platinum, no bacon bits bc I didn't have any :( and used 3 jalapenos instead of green chiles. My boyfriend loved it and said he'd bring some to work the next day for lunch so I know he actually isn't lying to me that he liked it lol! And even my lil sis who is a fussy eater said it tastes better than Wendy's chili which she really likes. Thank you for sharing this wonderful n foolproof recipe!

This was a huge hit at work. The only change I made was adding fresh sliced mushrooms. By far the best chili I've ever had!

I can't recall leaving a recipe comment ever, but I had to for this chili. It is truly amazing chili! I've made several versions of chili lately searching for the "right" one. This just might be it. I can't imagine chili tasting any better than this. Thank you so much for sharing. It will be my secret weapon at future potlucks.

Delicious chili! I halved the recipe and used smoked sausage because that's what I had thawed. This was a bit spicy, I couldn't give it to my baby. I used a jalapeno pepper instead of a Chile because my grocery store didn't have chile peppers, and omitted the hot sauce because I didn't have any, but it was still plenty spicy!

Awesome recipe. I made a few changes and used regular ground pork instead of Italian sausage. Also I didn't use bell peppers because my kids hate them. Everything else was the same and it turned out delicious!

My Husband said this chili was really hearty and satisfying. I like the chili very much, but I like my moms a bit more. For come reason no mater how hard I try I cannot duplicate it. I think it is because my mom has no exact measurements. My husband liked this recipe more than my moms.

Excellent! I didn't use spicy chili beans (which btw are pinto beans) and I used a tsp of diced chiles in the can instead of fresh, excellent excellent! Enjoy on a crisp cool fall day!

Made this recipe last weekend for Sunday Night Football.  We invited my husbands side of the family over and everyone loved it. Served it with saltines, fritos, shredded cheese and sour cream. I did not change a thing. Best chili I've ever made.

Last summer, my husband and I planted way too many tomato plants and I had to find things to do with all of them (I would rather freeze than can)- I skinned some tomatoes (a minute in boiling water to remove skins), cut them up, then used this recipe subbing 28 oz fresh tomatoes for the canned tomatoes. I chopped up the veggies and combined every ingredient (using beef base instead of cubes), EXCEPT beans and meat (and obviously the chips and cheese), in a large mixing bowl. I split the veggie mix in 3 freezer bags and froze them. When I was ready to try it out, it went from the freezer to the crock pot with 1 lb of cooked ground meat (think we just used beef) and 1 can (or more) of beans for 1 bag of veggie mix. I let it cook on low 6-8 hours, stirring occasionally. Yummy! I made another batch and gave the frozen bags with directions to my family and they all agreed that it was incredible! Awesome recipe. Now, the tomatoes are here again, so I came back to grab the recipe and do it again...mmmmmm

What I love most about this recipe is that you can substitute ingredients and still come out with a great taste.  For example, I have used cans of medley beans of 6 different varieties with black beans and corn.  I have used chicken in place of the beef and when I unexpectedly ran out of chili powder I used taco seasoning.  End result . . . a family favorite!

A really good chili base.  I made the following adjustments: 1lb cubed chuck steak in place of 1lb ground chuck, 4 strips bacon instead of bacon bits, light red kidney beans in place of 1 can of mild chili beans, 1/2 jalepeno and full Anaheim for chili peppers, double the garlic, sambal oleak in place of hot pepper sauce, full can of lite beer.  I browned the ground meats together, then browned the cubed steak, then fried the bacon, then partially cooked the celery, bell peppers, chili peppers, garlic, and onion in the leftover oils and juices.  I did drain each individual meat as it came off the pan.  Then everything into a dutch oven and simmer for 3 hours.  I cooled overnight, then heat and simmered another 2 hours the next night before serving.  It's spicy for some, but a can of crushed pineapple (or portion thereof) really helps cut the heat.

Love this recipe.  Instead of the 2 diced Chili's, I dice up one Jalapeno.  I also use 28 oz diced tomatoes and 28 oz Rotel diced tomatoes with Chiles.  Just enough heat.  Even my son loves it.

I made this without changing too much, as it was the first time I was trying it. Without doubt, the best chili I have ever made! The flavors were wonderful, and my husband said it was the best chili he has ever had. That is a big compliment coming from a huge chili lover! 
The only thing I am going to do differently next time is try to lower the sodium content. It was crazy high with the canned beans, bouillon and sauce. Other than that, no changes!

This is my third time making this.  I always invite people to come taste this, sometimes they don't come, I don't mind since I can eat on it all week.  We just got another cold front in Wisconsin so chili is perfect.  I love this recipe!!  The best.  The sugar and the beer really sets it off.

This is my go-to chili recipe! I'm from the east coast, so chili with beans is what I'm use to. I make a few modifications though. I omit the sausage, celery, bacon bits, beer, bouillon, and Worcestershire . All that is unnecessary if you want some down to earth chili (saves a lot of money too). Sometimes the tomato past (I don't think it does anything other than thicken the consistency). I also add a whole bell pepper for a half recipe (6 servings feeds a 3 person family for 2 days). I add 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder, and add more seasonings to taste (I may go overboard on the cumin - love that stuff). I add garlic powder as well as the minced garlic because it just tastes better,  honestly. I also cook the peppers and onions before adding to the chili. Drain the canned tomatoes, not the chili beans. Serve with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, saltine crackers and some red wine. Everyone loves this chili! I give it 4 stars because sausage and beer? Seriously? Save that for some other meal, or drink the beer with your chili.

I have tried many different chili recipes and this now rates at the top of the list.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 1 lb spicy pork sausage, 1 lb spicy chicken sausage and 1 lb grass fed ground beef chuck.  I couldn't find the beans in spicy sauce at my grocery store so I used 4 cans of chili beans.  To compensate, I added a little extra jalapeno (with seeds) for spice.  The flavors are delicious and complex  with the bacon and different peppers and spices all melding together with the beans and meat.  So yummy!  Authentic or not, it is some good tasting stuff!

I made this recipe as it says and it came out perfectly. I didn't add any chile peppers because of some picky eaters that night but it still came out great. Someone who doesn't like beans loved it, my mom who doesn't like chili loved it and all kids ate it. I will make chili like this from now on. Thanks!

So, I made this tonight for the Super Bowl party and it was an absolute hit! The lights are out in the stadium now, so I decided to give my rendition of this recipe. I first started by cooking thick cut peppered bacon from Whole Foods and used the grease to cook the veggies (I added a teaspoon  minced jalapeño) then added all of the dry ingredients to bloom the flavors. I  also added 2 teaspoons of cocoa, molasses and Dijon mustard. Then I made a well in the Dutch oven and browned the Italian sausage, then the hamburger (I used 1/2 the amount of hamburger) and then added a pound of finely diced stew meat. Once that it was browned I brought it up to a very high heat and deglazed with beer until there was no grease left. I added the tomatoes and Bush's medium chili beans, half of the cans drained. I let it simmer for 5 hours and it was delicious!! I believe that this will be my go to chili recipe from now on.

Such great flavors and taste. I prefer the consistency of the recipe WITHOUT draining the 3 cans of beans. When you drain them it is too thick and pasty.

This is fantasic! LOVE IT! I always try a new chili for Superbowl. I make two chilis for this, one hot one not. This was not hot at all. The only thing I did not put in (sausage and bacon). And for the chili pepper I used a 4 ounce can of chilis. I was very pleased with this. Busting with flavor!

This is the best chili recipe ever! My family LOVES it and my kids ask for it over and over! I do modify it a little. I use 1 lbs lean ground beef and 1 lb lean ground turkey sausage to reduce the fat. I also blend the tomatoes as my kids don't like chunky tomatoes. I use chicken stock in place of the beer. And I just leave out the chili peppers as it is already plenty "HOT" for our liking without them. Very little modification but very, very tasty! Don't be afraid to give it a try! I always make it in the crockpot and let is simmer all day. It's always better that way and even better the next day! Makes a very large pot . . plenty of leftovers!!

Family loved it, everyone at the table said it was the best chili they've ever had. I excluded the sausage and still came out great. Also added light beer since that's all we had and added more bacon bits. I was tasting it as it was simmering, and added just a little more salt, tabasco, pepper. Just keep tasting it. I will definitely make this chili again. Great recipe. Hope this helps.

Since I only prepare this dish during the cooler months, somehow I forget just how delicious it is until we have it again. 
The only thing I purposely omit is the chile peppers. Besides that, I make adjustments for our personal preferences, such as an additional onion. A bit heavier on the seasonings and sugar, with the addition of garlic powder. I also put some seasoning on the meat as it browns.
We pair this with grated cheddar, cornbread, and sour cream. 
If I were making this for a potluck, I would definitely make a day ahead, as it tastes better the longer it sits in the refrigerator.

Really flavorful. Much spicier than I expected. Too spicy for the kiddos in my house.

This is just a GREAT chili ! Dont be scared by all the ingredients - toss in what you have and dont worry about what you dont ! I had Rotel so used that instead - didnt have the sausage or chilies - but added a jalepeno ! Tossed in what beans I had in the pantry ! This is a great base ! ROLL TIDE CHILI, I had to rename it though !

I have made this chili 5-6 times now and it is a HIT every single time !! I dont substitute any ingredient and follow the recipe exactly and it is foolproof !!! A bit costly the first time you make it if you dont have all the spices but after that this is a inexpensive meal !! We LOVE it Cinncinnati style - over spaghetti !!!My husband HATES chili but actually just asked me if I can make this again  this weekend !!!

Absolutely delicious! I portioned the completed chili into mason jars, topped with cornbread mix, and then placed in the oven until the cornbread is cooked. Definitely one of the best chili recipes I've found yet!

This chili was too hot!!  OMG!!!  I think I am going to add some crushed pineapples to help mellow it out.  The flavor of the chili is really good but I just couldn't enjoy it all the way cause of how hot it was.  I am entering it in my work Chili cook off so will let you know how it does. :)

I actually made two batches of this today.  One for a charity chili cook-off at work tomorrow and the second for my family. As I was making the second batch I realized that I forgot to add the chili powder to the first batch, then I added too much chili powder to the second so after cooking the second I mixed the two batches and hello...welcome to the land of perfect chili, lol.. I actually changed it up a bit by adding three different kinds of beans, kidney, pinto and great northern plus the spicy chili beans called for in the recipe and I added a can of okra in tomatoes that I had in the cupboard...my family loves it...let's see how I do tomorrow at the cookoff...

This went over VERY well, my husband couldn't stop eating it.  We love spicy foods in our house and this definitely qualifies.  If making for people who prefer more mild chili I would cut the chili powder in half but perfect for us as written!

Outstanding chili, enjoyed by all!  I made this for 4 Purdue Boilermaker students that were on their way back to Purdue from a collegiate water-ski tournament.  Not sure I've ever made a recipe that had 28 ingredients.  I used all of them, and the only change was to add the entire can of beer rather than 1/2 cup.  I don't like beer, but didn't want to waste it.......in the pot it went.  I put all the ingredients in the crock-pot about 7:30 am.  I took the lid off for 1 hour in the afternoon to thicken the chili while it cooked and then put the lid back on.  At 5:00 pm in the evening, the chili was perfect thickness.  I served this with 'Waikiki Cornbread' from AR and it was a wonderful side to this chili.  The kids loved it and all took leftovers home.  There is a reason there are over 2,600 reviews, still holds a 5-star rating, and one of AR's top 20 recipes.  This chili is just that good.  Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.

I've been making this chili for several years.  I rate it a 5 because it's the best chili I've ever eaten.  The only thing I do different is I don't add the cayenne pepper or hot sauce.  Everything else goes in.  I feel the spice in the chili beans, chili peppers (I use anaheims) gives me enough heat. If family wants it hotter, they can add it later. And since my family are Hoosiers, I have to call it Hoosier Tailgate Chili. Try this recipe just the way it is if you like the kick, then adjust it to your own needs.

Excellent chili!  Very smooth consistency. Not too spicy or bland, so this is a crowd pleaser! I cut the recipe in half, but did add one full bottle of beer.

My husband picked this recipe after he signed me up for a chili cook off at his squadron. We took 2nd place and I was told it was the first empty pot. I did make a few changes (because my husband is picky). I used busch's chili beans so I think they were 16oz cans. Instead of 2 cans diced tomatoes w/juice and 2 green chile peppers I used the 10oz cans of rotell with green chiles in it. I used maybe 3/4 of an onion, not a whole one. I only used one celery stalk, and NO bell peppers at all. It doesn't say what kind of beer to use (full or light) but I used Coors light. And those are the only changes I made. While making it I thought it was REALLY spicey  but after stirring real good and letting it simmer it had the perfect  amount of spice. This is going to be my new go to chili.

I have prepared this dish four times. One time I followed the recipe verbatim and the other times I used jalapenos and only ground chuck. Both times I received rave reviews. I can tell you that this chili is so much better the second day. It is a little spicy but I don't think there should be anyone that cannot eat it unless they can stand absolutely no spice.

I use this recipe when I'm having company and I want to serve chili. It has a very large number of ingredients which is the only reason I didn't rate it five stars. It is really worth the effort.

I've made this chili at least 7 times in the past year and have received nothing but the highest praise from all sorts of people.  This recipe has the best combination of flavor, subtle heat, and texture out of the many other chili recipes I have tried.  I usually use 2 cans of pinto beans and 1 can of northern beans, in addition to the chili beans in spicy sauce.  Depending on the audience (read: tailgate or mostly male), I'll cook up an entire pack of bacon, chop it up, and throw it into the chili. I cannot think of a better way to improve this chili - it is literally perfect.

We were having a fiesta party for the 4th.  I changed up the recipe a little bit.  I used 3/4 can if diced green chilies, diced up a few jalapenos from a jar and a little of the juice, a little taco seasoning, some garlic powder, onion powder.  I sauteed the onion a little before adding.  These were all in addition to the regular recipe.  It turned out amazing.   Nice amount of heat but not overly hot.  Served with sour cream and cheese.  Delicious my friends raved about it!

Made this today with a little twist.  I will call it Left Over BBQ Chili.  I used left over BBQ meat from a BBQ this past Sunday.  I used 4 grilled hamburgers, 5 grilled hotdogs and about a pund of smoked pulled pork.  Other than that I did the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I will make it agan.

This is great, I don't think it tastes like it 'came out of a can' at all.  I've also made it w/out the beer and/or bacon bits and it still comes out great.

Here is the method I used. All ingredients in the pressure cooker, except meats and beans. Cook for 20 minutes. Release pressure according to instructions. Puree if you like. Add meats, beans and cook until done. Taste, readjust seasonings. Serve or let rest until next day!

This is the first chili I have ever made and it was fantastic. Talk about making your tastebuds sing !!! I have tried other chili cook-off recipes but this one takes the prize in my opinion.Just the right amount of heat. I tried this with 3lbs.of cubed steak as one reviewer suggested, instead of the ground chuck and it was a hit. Love It Love It Love It !!

This was a big hit at our house, especially when I added baking mix dumplings on top. The only other changes were because of what we had on hand: wine instead of beer, no sausage, tomato soup instead of tomato paste, and less spice, because that's what we like, and added chicken broth to make it soupier to accomodate the dumplings. Will definitely be making again.

I enjoyed this dish, however I'm not the kind of man who places beans in my chili.  I would suggest using breakfast sausage because it's a hint sweeter and adds a unique flavor.  I didn't feel "bacon bits" would do justice, so I cut into 1cm x 1cm "extra thick cut bacon" and fried it.  The key is to drain the fat and not use it.  Makes for a mess if you don't and I learned from experience on that one.  This is why only 4 of 5 stars.  Aside from that, it was delicious.  Thank you MightyPurdue22 for this one.

Ever since I found this recipe on allrecipes, I don't make any other chili recipe. The only thing I do different is add 3-4 unseeded, unveined serrano peppers and increase the chili powder, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper. Always gets rave reviews from people that don't mind the heat.

Love this recipe, very versatile if you don't have all of the ingredients. I add mushrooms and skip the some of the spicy stuff to make it kid friendly. Great recipe!

This chili is amazing! 
These are the changes I made (I feel like that is OK to do with Chili because it's based mostly on preference).
I made mine in two large pots (dutch ovens) as I did not have one large stock pot.
I fried about 6 strips of bacon and then sauteed the veggies first in the bacon fat. I then cut the bacon up on small pieces and added it to the chili mixture. Instead of the bacon bits, I hate those. :

This was good chili. I misread the recipe and used 4 cups of beef broth instead of 4 cubes of bouillon. Needless to say, it was on the brothy side, so I simmered it uncovered for 2 hours and then drained off a bit of excess liquid. Flavorful enough for all the adults who ate it and mild enough that (when served with noodles and cheese) my 1-year-old liked it, too.

I had never made chili before and decided to enter the chili cook off at work.  This recipe had really good reviews so I used it.  WE WON 1st PLACE!!! I'm keeping this recipe to use at home.  The only thing I changed was adding a little more spice.  We wanted it hot.

I thought this was a pretty solid chili recipe. I cooked it about three weeks ago following the instructions verbatim and was pretty pleased with the results. The only complaint my mom and I had was it seemed a little sweet, presumably because of the Italian beef, which is sometimes seasoned to be a little sweet. I'm going to try it again in about a week or two, instead this time I'm going to use ground turkey and chorizo rather than the ground chuck and Italian sausage. I'm also going to do it in my crock pot. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Boiler Up!

This is the best chili recipe I have ever made! It is a little on the spicy side for me, but my husband loves it! I omitted the bacon bits simply because I didn't have any, and I used an entire 11oz of beer. Next time, I will only used 3 cans total of beans, just simply because thats a LOT of protein!

A good recipe but not as great as I had hoped.  I made it in the crock pot, so I wonder if doing on the stove top would have pushed it to 5 stars.  I turned down the heat, since we don't like really spicy food.  It was all gone at the end of the evening!

I made this a couple of weeks ago. It was the first time using this recipe so I made it exactly as the recipe states. Im a pretty good cook, so I thought I would change it next time, but it seriously was PERFECTION! I took it to a friends house that had a chili cook-off and took first place. It's hot enough and has a great variety of spices. The foodies in the crowd were trying to breakdown the flavors. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did :)

I am not a cynic.  I'm sure I did something wrong.  After all the awesome reviews I couldn't wait to make this chili and followed the recipe almost to the letter.  it was much too spicy for my wife and I.  Even after adding a can of pureed pineapples, too much heat.  This chili tasted ok but was nothing to write home to mom about.  It made a huge pot and I'm probably going to flush it and look for a more simple recipe, probably from another site as well.

I made this last week to try it before I made it for a church chili supper. I didn't have any chili powder so made some of a recipe online. It had a nice bit to it and we enjoyed it very much. Because it made so much I put 3 quart sized bags of it in the freezer for last minute suppers in the future. Today I made it for the chili supper tomorrow and I had bought chili powder at a local specialty store and continued to add all the listed ingredients. This pot is quite a bit spicier than the first. Hope everyone there likes it. It's still good, just spicier. Maybe if I make it again I would cut down the amount of the spices. Hubby likes it and that's what matters. :)

Great!  Very forgiving recipe--I used chorizo sausage and  left out the chili powder.

I made this for a chili contest at work and received first place. I ommitted the celery and hot sauce. Cooked it two days before the contest and let it sit in the fridge. Placed it in the crock pot the day of the contest on a low setting for about four hours.

I have been making this recipe for 4 years now. Haven't found a better one. It is worth adding all the ingredients listed. If there is anything left over, will freeze well and great to add into a Quesadilla or quick nachos for the kids dinner. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Made this chili and it was good- although soo not worth the time and effort.  I make a quick 30 minuteversion of this w/ beer, similar spices etc and couldn't really tell a difference (and neigher could my husband).  In fact, he said, for as long as that took, it really doesn't taste much different than your normal chili (which takes less time and has fewer ingredients).  The recipe was good, but I only gave it three starts b/c you can obtain same flavor w/ fewer ingredients and less time.

Awesome recipe... mixed ground chicken and venison because that was what was in the freezer.  Also through on a dollop of sour cream before serving.  Everyone loved it with the frito lay corn chips.

This recipe is great because it withstands quite a bit of adjusting and still pleases crowds. I made it for 6 and instead of cumin and chili powder used half a packet of taco seasoning I had left over. I also threw in 2 dried whole chili peppers during simmering and removed them to serve. The heat was perfect. I used brown sugar and a bit more beer than it called for. I look forward to it tasting even better as leftovers!

This is HANDS DOWN the best chili EVER!!! I did however make minor adjustments as my husband does not like his chili too spicy. I omitted the hot sauce, green chiles and cayenne pepper. I also left out the salt as the sausage makes it salty enough for our liking. I tell everyone about this recipe when they are looking to make chili! Definitely worth making!!!

This was a wonderful recipe! I like my food spicy, so I used four cans of spicy beans and 1/4 cup cayenne pepper ... I also added green onion and cilantro at the end. Oh yea, I used turkey instead of beef. The family loved it! It went quick.

This is one of the best Chili's I ever made and ate. I was a bit worried about it being a yankee chili, but I was totally wrong. It was awesome.
First time I made it, I followed the directions exactly (great). The second time I made it, I left out the Italian sausage and replaced it with 1 more pound of ground beef (excellent).
I have made it for a family of 10 and everyone loved it. Made chili dogs with it and again, wonderful.
I do leave out the celery. No reason, just don't want to get it.
I also add a little more beer, but no big deal.
And I get fresh spices from the fresh market. May or may not make a difference. I just like fresh.

I love this recipe. I've changed it a little. I use smoked paprika and Chipotle hot sauce. Also use ground pork and my family doesn't like celery. Other wise its basically the same. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best chili ever. I followed the recipie pretty much as written except I increased the ground beef to #3  and used 4 cans of hot undrained chili beans. Also, I put all the ground beef and Italian sausage in 1 crockpot to warm up enough  so I could the drain the fat then chopped until crumbly and added it to a larger crockpot where I already had all the other ingredients warming. Once everything was combined, I let it cook for about 6 hrs. Then unplugged and  sit overnight. It's customary in my family that we have chili for Christmas eve family gathering, so I made this the day ahead, but several people have been sampling this throughout the day and I'm holdinig out hope there is enough for tonight's dinner? This recipie is a keeper...nothing wimpy about this at all. Now the big decision is weather I want to share the recipie with everyone????? Hmmmm, always something to decide. Thanks for the great recipie and Merry Christmas.

So great! Made it exactly how the recipe states except couldn't find "spicy chili beans" so used kidney beans with jalapenos. Good solid taste with just enough warmth (spice) to make it intersting but not painful for this Yankee.

Absolutely excellent.  But NOTE this makes a LOT!  I had to split it between my two biggest dutch ovens.  Even more than the 12 hearty big-man portions I figured the yield meant. LOL

This has been my go-to chili recipe for almost 10 years. Sometimes I haven’t had all the ingredients (no veggies, different veggies, plain beans, one meat or three meats, etc). I’ve made it on the stovetop and in a slow-cooker. Omitted meats for a vegetarian version. Through all the variations, I honestly believe it’s the spices/seasonings that make this chili delicious every single time.

Wow, this is by far the greatest chili I have ever tasted! Anyone who doesn't like this recipe obviously has no clue what good chili is supposed to taste. Kudo's to the chef that created!!

I've made this twice.  HUGE HIT.  In fact, I'm required to bring this to every football game now... Thanks for posting!  So easy - one pot - short cook time - throw it all in a pot and feed many, many hungry bellies!  I don't change much - added jalapeno; forgot green pepper once; I love Worcestershire and hot sauce... MMMMM!  Always bring cheese, fritos and oyster crackers.  Fritos are my fav!  Oh! And a dollop of guacamole is simply sinful!

This recipe just won the office chili cook-off against 9 other entries.  The only thing I did different was to leave out the celery.  I put everything in the crock pot and let it go.  Wonderful and easy.

great recipe, I did the 6 person serving option, and that was plenty for my family, plus another dinner!!  i subbed low sodium beef stock for the beef bullion cube, so it wasnt so salty - i just let it cook an extra 1/2 hr to reduce the extra liquid.  This recipe is very easy to make, and not time consuming at all! Throw your ingredients in the pot, and let 'er cook!!! Thanks for sharing :)

this recipe is an excellent template for making a chili that is right for YOU. its not exactly to me or my families taste if I follow the recipe to the t, but its the perfect template. I just add a little less chili powder, ground pork instead of sausage(sausage is great just not a big fan of sausage myself), and im still experimenting with different beers. Ichiban rice ale was my favorite so far.

I thought this recipe was way too much work for the result.  It was just OK, not great but not bad.  I made just as listed but for only 6 servings.

This chili was perfect before we headed out to see a football game. I agree that it gets hotter after it sat for a few days but that just made it all the better. This recipe is now our 'go to' for chili. I would never have thought to add sausage but it really brought out ann entirely different flavor than my usual [old] chili recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This chili is AMAZING! I changed it up though since my husband and I don't eat red meat - and it was still amazing! We used lean ground turkey instead of beef, eliminated the sausage, beef bouillon cubes, and bacon. Also eliminated the celery, used a small can of chopped green chilis (couldn't find fresh ones at small market), and I was a little over-generous with a full cup of cheap light beer. The result was an AMAZING, incredible, LOW-FAT, lean chili. Of course, none of our guests were told it was a "healthy" version, and were none the wiser. I cooked it in my Crock Pot for 8 hours - it was gone 2 hours after that!

This is my go-to chili recipe and it is always well received.  I use a combination of 1 lb. boneless New York strip steak that I cube, 1/2 lb. ground chuck and a 1/4 lb. hot bulk sausage for my meat.  I like things spicy, so I definitely add chopped hot peppers and I use Rotel diced tomatoes for extra flavor.  I top mine with shredded pepper jack cheese, sour cream, cilantro and diced avocado.  Instead of the corn chips, I thinly slice and fry in oil corn tortillas...adds a lot of authenticity!  Really great base recipe for all the spices and seasonings that chili needs!  Yum!  Yum!

5-star chili recipe. Won me 1st place in a cook-off, with nother leftover. I made a few adjustments, but the heart of this recipe is a true winner. Used chuck roast in place of ground, + 1/2 lb of applewood smoked bacon, used 1 yellow+1 orange bell pepper for color, and 1 red chili+1 jalapeno+1 chipotle/adobo for flavor. And you definitely need to let the flavors "fuse" together overnight. My hat's off to the original creator of this chili!!

Great recipe. I did not use ground chuck but rather got a 3 Lb. chuck roast and diced it small like the veggies. I also omitted the tabasco and let folks add it as they wanted for as spicy as they wanted. 

It also did not have as much 'juice' as I would have liked so added 1 can of beef stock.

This is a phenomenal recipe!  The only tweaks my hubby made were using real bacon instead of "bacon bits", omitted the red bell pepper, and halved the cayenne pepper.  It was rich, delicious, and had just the right amount of heat for us!  Cheers, MightyPerdue22, for your chili genius!

I made this for our Halloween Party and had a chili toppings bar. Everyone loved it!  I reduced down the heat and the number of cans of beans.  I also put in the refrigerator overnight to enhance the flavors. I made an extra large batch and delivered some to a few new moms from our church--great dish for sharing!

We really l like making this chili the Saturday before the football game on Sunday and then reheating. Modifications I make: ground turkey/sausage/beef mix and I substitute all the dried spices with a package of chili seasoning but I add a little extra fresh garlic towards the end of the recipe. Sometimes I vary the bean quantities or add extra veg like a can of corn.

I made this amazing chili for a Fall/Halloween party for approx 25 people.  We as a group had decided to make "chili" to feed everyone, we ended up with 3 different crock pots, each with a different recipe. Needless to say, this one was the one emptied while the others stood half full. 
I only adjusted the "spice" to half and it still had a super flavor appeal.  Thank you!! I will be making this one again.
BIG BIG HIT!!

Taste is awesome. I like a thicker chili. Next time I will try to figure out how to thicken it a bit.

This is only the second time making chili and it tasted like I am a chili pro!  I substituted stew meat for the ground beef as someone else suggested and used a crock pot to cook.  The only suggestion that I would do the second time around is put it in the crock pot without meat for 6-7 hours on low then add the browned meat and cook for an additional 2-3 hours.  I also cut the vegetables in 1/2 inch chunks which made a great chunky chili

Sooooo good. I didn't use tabasco for those that don't like it too spicy. I figured they could add it if they wanted. I also found a "basic beer cheese bread" recipe that I made and it complimented your chili very nicely. Thank you for sharing this, but I have to tell you as a University of Michigan Grad, we play you guys next Saturday and we will beat you while eating your delicious chili. LOL Seriously though. Loved this recipe :)

Yum!!  I cant take much heat so I had to change a few ingredients but stayed with the recipe overall and won a neighborhood chili contest. I made the chili 2 days ahead of time. Only used 1/8 cup chili powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne for spice (left out the tabasco and chile peppers) didn't have bacon or sausage so I used extra beef. Great texture and just right on the spice side for me.

An excellent chili. Rich and Hearty, with enough spice to enjoy and not too much for the kids. I doubled the chuck (but not ground)the second time, because you can't ever too much meat inyour chili.

This chili is awesome!!!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I used ground turkey instead.  I cooked it low and slow for almost 5 hours and it was perfect.  My family loved it.  Great recipe!!

My GO TO chili for football Sunday or just when I want chili.  My only changes are as follows: I use ground turkey, turkey sausage and less hot sauce and cayenne because the kids have to eat this too. PERFECT chili recipe!!

This by far THE best chili I've ever eaten.  It has many ingredients but it is so worth the time.  I made it on our first fall day here and it hit the spot.  Just the right amount of "hot." Thank you so much for this recipe.  It will be a family favorite.

Possibly the best Chili I have ever had.  I added a little more chili powder and hot sauce about half way through, and I cooked it for about 3 hours in a croc pot. Delicious with some cheese, fritos, and sour cream on top. I think I'll go get another bowl!

This is a great Chili recipe. I am not able to tolerate spicy food so I left out the Tabasco and cut down the chili powder to 2 tablespoons. I used a full cup of beer. I also sauteed the onions and peppers with the bacon before adding them. I put all the ingredients in the crockpot and left it on low for about 4hrs. turned out perfect!

I love this chili! I make it at least 2-3 times a year! I only make a few changes that, to me, just make it a little easier. I use four cans of rotel instead of the cans of tomatoes and green chili peppers. I also just use four cans of seasoned kidney beans and I use turkey italian sausage, but that's a personal preference. I brown the meat and throw everything in a crock pot and let it simmer all day on low. And I save the bacon bits and sprinkle on top with cheese and sour cream. Delicious!

I'm not a huge chili fan but my husband is so I gave this recipe a try. It was amazing. I left out the beer and bacon bits because I didn't have it. This chili is so flavorful. Husband of course loved it. Thanks MIGHTYPURDUE22!

Amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I left the celery out because I am not a big fan of it.  Because I love spicy food, I added jalepenos.  Like other reviewers mentioned, instead of plain tomatoes I bought the cans that had lime and cilantro just to add more flavors to the chili.  It is so easy to make and freezes well (if there is any left over to freeze)

I have lived in Az 50 years and I love spicy mexican food. But I totally agree with a lot of reviews that 1/2 the heat of this recipe is perfect. It is delicious and when I was reading over the ingredients I thought it a shame to over power them with chili powder. I did everthing exactly, except 1/2 chili powder and cayenne. My wife and I thought it was perfect....way better than Wendy's (as on reviewr stated)

Absolutely the most amazing chili and I don't even like chili.  My boyfriend and I tried it out and were so happy with it and then I made it for all of his guy friends for a big football game day and got rave reviews.  This is on the superbowl menu for sure.  Really easy to make too - don't let the long ingredient list deter you.

This is fantastic. Made it several times for Grey Cup (in Canada) and Superbowls. Well worth doubling the quanty and freezing it if there's any left!!  Even my kids like this one.
I substitute ground turkey (chicken works too) to lighten the taste and texture, and to significantly reduce the fat content.

Just ok...  I personally like my chili more spicy and less tomato-y.  I felt it was pretty bland, had to add a lot more chili powder/cumin and add jalapenos.  It was ok over rice w/ cheese and Fritos but I'm not jumping up and down over it...  Not that impressed.

Great!!! I have three toddlers so I did leave out the chile peppers, cut the spicy spices in half and used mild chili beans and it still had wonderful flavor and some kick!  I threw REAL bacon into the meat when I cooking it... Husband loved that!

This chili was to-die-for! It was heaven in a bowl. I did cut down alittle on the spices..added half the cayenne and chili powder. I wind up adding more chili powder later. I figure you can always add spices later, you can't take them away lol my sister gobbled this up! i'm eating some for breakfast now. Also for the beans I used 1 can black beans, 1 can of dark red kidney, and 1 can of light red kidney. The sausage added a really nice flavor! It's well worth breaking out all the seasoning. I measure and mix them together ahead of time so I can just add them all at once.

This was excellent. My husband said it was the best he's ever had.  I just attended a chili cook-off last week ant tasted dozens of chilis and none compared to this. I will be entering with this recipe next year.

I was talked into a chili cookoff and received very positive feedback.  I picked this recipe to start with.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I added the following: 1 lb of regular sausage, 6 oz tomato sauce, an extra chile and celery stalk.  For the bacon I used 2 slices and let the onion and garlic heat in the drippings while I was prepping the rest.  I didn't have beer, but didn't miss it.  I made it in the slow cooker the evening before and just put the crock in the frig at bedtime.  It reheated nicely and I think even improved the next day.  The spice combination is very nice and I like all the veggies which provided a nice texture and presentation.

This chili is superb. I changed it to suit my family's tastes by draining the cans of tomatoes and adding bloody mary mix in place of the juice. Also, we don't like lots of tomatoes in ours so I used only 3 14oz cans. I used 3 cans chili beans and one can red kidney beans. We don't like it quite so spicy/hot so I omitted the Tabasco and it is still plenty hot and flavorful. I also added 1Tbs fresh corriander (cilantro) and this gave it a very yummy flavor. I will be making this chili again.

I made this chili last weekend and followed the recipe exactly except left out the celery. It was delicious! My son and husband added more heat to their bowls. I'm pretty whimpy and this was definitely not too hot. My husband who dislikes green and red peppers was leery when he saw how many peppers were in the pot, but he admitted the flavors all blended so nicely you could not distinguish the peppery taste that he dislikes.

This recipe was pretty spicy, at least for my roommates and I- although we're from the Midwest and typically buy mild salsa.  I used just the cayanne pepper with no Tabasco, hot sauce, or chili peppers and thought it had just the right kick to it.  Overall yummy.

Not a bad chili. I agree with another post though, the ingredient list was a bit long. While I like my chili on the Hot side, my honey doesnt. So I used mild chili beans, and one can of kidney beans. I did not use the chili peppers or any tobasco sauce. The portion is great for a big family or a party.

This was fabulous.  I won a chili cook-off using this recipe.  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of beans, we don't love beans.  But soo good.

WOW!! seriously...this chilli is the best I've ever tasted! I won a chili cookoff with this recipe!  I did make a few adjustments but that was to make it spicy!  I used fire roasted tomatoes and only the chili beans in spicy sauce. I used more worcestershire and tabasco too. The meat was so tender! No one could stop eating it! SO happy that I finally found a chili recipe that is amazing JUST the way it is!

Great recipe.  I made it for a chili cook-off at work and came in first place.  I adjusted recipe a little.  Added more beer, brown sugar instead of white sugar, more hot sauce.  Cooked bacon and crumbled.  Use bacon juice to cook sautee onion and celery before adding to pot.  Used some bacon grease to in browning meat.  Also added some brown sugar BBQ sauce.  Great taste. Sweet with a knick.

This recipe is awesome. My boyfriend said it was the best chili he has had, and commented "I taste so many spices!" It was very flavorful. The only exceptions I had to make was that I had no worcestershire sauce to add, and I used some quartered pepperoni slices in place of sausage. Also, I used chopped garden-fresh tomatoes in place of canned tomatoes. I had some definite kick to it but not too much. I halved the reciped and we had dinner for two along with enough leftover for 2 or 3 more lunches for 2. :)

I have made this chili over 20 times now and it is the best. The key in this recipe seems to be the boulion cubes, ground italian sausage, and sugar to keep down the acid. One twist I do with my chili is use bush chili beans with medium chili sauce instead of the drained cans chili beans, and I use 1 16 ounce can of dark red kidney beans instead of the can of chili beans in spicy sauce. I also add 1/2 pound of sirloin or filet steak bits.

Great chili.  Used 2 chipotle peppers instead of green chili.  Cut amount of cayenne in half and was still plenty spicy for us.  Used half ground meat and half chuck roast.  Will make again.

This is truly the best chili I've ever made, and as a fan of chili and spicy food in general (and an Illini fan) that's a pretty bold statement.  Other than a handful of whole habaneros, I stuck to the original recipe.  This is the only chili I will ever make again.  Fantastic.

This is a great basic chile recipe.  I mix up the ingredients based on what I have on hand....If I don't have chile powder, I just add extra cayenne.  If I don't have beer, I don't add it....I personally like alot more garlic, so I add lot more.  Use whatever canned tomatoes you have on hand...Tomato paste, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, etc... If you like a thicker broth, add Masa Harina (avail. in the hispanic section of grocery store) Add about 1/4 cup to 1 cup of water and still and add to chile and bring back to boil and cook for about 5 extra minutes.  Real authentic tex mex flavor by doing this.

Delicious. We made this last night and it was a success. When taste-testing from the pot, we weren't too sure about the flavor balance, but in the end it was just great.  Used Miller Lite for the beer and halved the recipe. Will definitely make again.

Nice flavor, it really hit the spot :)  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  Followed the recipe almost verbatim, only changes I made were I had no bacon bits, and we wanted a more soupy chili so added a family size can of Campbell's Tomato Soup along with a small can of diced green chilis with 2 diced jalapeno peppers deveined and deseeded.

Excellent recipe.  Made for a family party and everyone asked for the recipe.  I served as a "chili bar" and had the fixins on the side - sour cream, cheese, macaroni noodles, green onions, oyster crackers.  I scaled back the heat - 1 jalepeno instead of chile peppers, no hot sauce, chili beans with medium sauce, and only half the black pepper and cayenne pepper.  The sausage, beer, and seasonings gave great flavor.  definitely a keeper.

Great Chili!  Usually when I make a recipe and rate it, I make it exactly as written.  I cheated this time and used a crockpot instead of a stovetop simmer.  Cooked on high for 2 hours and switched to low for 4 more hours.  It filled the 6 quart crockpot to the brim!  Plenty of leftovers, but not for lack of eating.  Next time I will halve the recipe and not change anything - except skip the Fritos...they are unnecessary.

This is perfect chili! I made it as written as much as possible. I didn't know how hot it would be so I used Aneheim peppers and cut back on the cayenne, black pepper and Tabasco. I didn't drain the chili beans and I used Ranch Style beans in place of the chili beans in spicy sauce. I left out the beer. I used smoked paprika. The result was fabulous! It might have been a little thicker if I had drained the chili beans, but it wasn't too thin either! I cooked the meat, drained it and added it to a crock pot with all the other ingredients to cook for 6 hours on high. Even though this recipe has a lot of ingredients, it's easy to make.

This is an amazing chili recipe!! Even though it seems daunting just because of the sheer number of ingredients, it is actually quite easy to prepare. All you need is time. I would recommend being more generous with the spices as they seemed to have been overwhelmed e.g. by the chili beans sauce and tomato juices.

I omitted the italian sausage and doubled the beef simply because that is the kind of chili I grew up on.  This recipe was fantastic!  Especially the different types of peppers mixed in.

This was a great chili and it makes a lot.  I did make some changes to suite our diet.  I used lean turkey burger and seasoned a pound of it so that it was similar to italian sausage.  I also used kidney beans instead of chili beans.  I couldn't find chili peppers so I used jalapenos instead.  I also cut down on the spices because we like a very mild chili.  It had great flavor.  I will be making it again.

Easily the best home made chili I've ever had (don't tell mom lol). Not a whole lot involved in making, most of the ingredients are usually in my cupboard/refridgerator anyway. The worst part about this recipe is waiting for it to cook. I will make this for many a cold day to come and I can promise I'll have friends and family knocking down my door when that time comes!

OUTSTANDING!! The only change that I made was to use bacon (3 thick slices cut up) in place of the bacon bits.  I cooked the bacon until crisp, then drained it and used the bacon fat to saute the onions, pepper, celery, etc.  This stuff just got better each day.  The reaction I got was OMG! from each person who tried it!  This will be my go to recipe for chili from now on

I am getting ready to make this recipe, and I hope all of the great reviews are accurate. I will be altering some of the ingredients slightly, however. I will be using fresh tomatoes instead of canned, leaving out the bacon bits, adding 1 extra tbsp of fresh minced garlic, adding 3 extra teaspoons of my "hot sauce", adding 1 extra tsp. of cayenne pepper, and I will be adding 2 carefully chopped bhut jolokia peppers. My goal is basically to make this a bit hotter than the recipe seems to be.  Anyways, I will let y'all know soon how it turns out.

This was a big hit at our house!  I did not use the beer or the hot sauce...there is definitely enough kick without it.  I messed up and added the whole 3 oz of Bacon Bits...and it was wonderful! This is our family's new chili recipe!  Thank you!

Ya know, this is the first REAL chili I ever made. I have my version, which is good. I thought for once I would try a recipe. Excellent. I followed it as written, though I was a tad short on the chili powder. Adjustments? I don't think it needs any. The spice was great, not to hot and we are a family with teens, picky eaters, hot and no spice eaters. We all ate it. I will make it again. Loved all the onion and peppers. The recipe really did not suggest what type of hot pepper to use, I used Jalapenos. Just really good and bomb proof if ya ask me.

Fantastic chili despite having to make changes based on what I had in the kitchen!  Was good even though I did not have any cayenne pepper or paprika.  Only used 2 cans of chili beans as a preference. Used 2 seeded jalapenos instead of chili peppers.  Forgot all about the Worcestershire sauce, only had 2 beef bouillon cubes on hand and cooked 3 slices of bacon instead of bacon bits.   And used 3/4 bottle of beer.  Ate with bread bowls from this site.

This was by far the best chili I have ever tasted! I prepared the recipe as directed.  Then transferred it into the crock pot set at low all day.  It came out sooo delicious!!! My husband took it for lunch the next day.  He ended up calling me just to tell me how excellent it tasted. Thanks I will be using this recipe again and again!!!!

This is a winner!  I didn't use beer because I didn't have any on hand, but I was more than satisfied with the flavor and heartiness of this recipe.  I'm always complimented whenever I serve this dish.  I brown the meat and toss everything in the crockpot.  Thanks Mightypurdue22!

This chili was excellent!   I made the beans (small red beans) myself and used tomato sauce instead of paste (what I had on hand).  Once it was all mixed I put it in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours.  I used all the spices as stated and we loved the spicy taste.  I may have calmed the taste down because I added most the water from cooking the beans.  This chili was not harder to make than my standard betty crocker chili.   I can't wait to taste this today.

Hmmm. Followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was alot of work, but this was my first chili. My husband and brother did not like it much as they said that there was a spice in it that was too overpowering. It also made so much.

OK this is now my official chili, only changes I made was to leave out celery, use entire bottle of beer (Chocolate Stout-yummy) and add in a can of Rotel Tomatoes and 1 TBS ea of Garlic & Onion Powder.  I also subsituted the Liquid Smoke for bacon as another reviewer.  I then made a Vegeterian version - all I did was swap the meat for 2 bags of Morning Star Farms Veggie Crumbles and added about a 1 1/2 cup veggie broth and did 2 cans dark red beans and 2 cans black beans, no chili beans in veggie version - OMG - the meat lovers even loved this version!  Oh and of course my ingredient I use in any chili I make - 1 tbs Cocoa - I brought to work and everyone ate it all up!  Awesome recipe!

This is great, and not nearly as complicated as it looks. I have a big pot of it simmering on the stove right now for the Super Bowl. I didn't have beer in the house, so I substituted red wine (a full cup of it.) I cut down on the amount of beans. The taste is fantastic, and it seems to be the sort of recipe where you can make substitutions and still have a great result.

The greatest chili I've ever made. Made absolutely no changes in ingredients except left the seeds in one of the peppers because I like spice. After browning the meat I through it all in a 7qt Slow Cooker (Filled it right to the top) and cook it on low 8 hours then refrigerate it overnight and cook it on low again another 6 hours the next day and then eat.

This is the best chili and I plan to make it again for this year's superbowl party.  To help cut back on the prep time, I always mix all the dry spices together the night before so I just dump those in all at once rather than measuring everything as I make the chili. My only change is cutting back on the cayenne pepper and like others I pass the hot sauce and a shaker of cayenne for those who like it hotter!

This was the first recipe I tried from this website and absolutely loved it!!! I made a few changes-I drain all the cans of beans, substituted half of the ground beef with cubed chuck steak that I browned first and took the easy way out using canned chopped green chilis and added canned diced jalapenos ( I like spicy chili). I used a dark beer ( Guinness one time, Sierra Nevada the next) and after cooking it according to the directions, I put it in the crockpot on low for 3-4 hours to tenderize the cubed chuck steak and allow the flavors to blend. I have been invited to three Superbowl parties this year on the condition I bring this chili!!! The best chili recipe EVER!!!!! I wasn't a Purdue fan but I am now!! :)

I used 1lb. each of lean ground beef, lean ground turkey, and Italian turkey sausage in an effort to cut some calories and fat. Honestly, you couldn't tell by the taste. I used a 4.5 oz. can of green chiles instead of fresh due to availability. Other than that, I followed ingredient list exactly. Two things to keep in mind: this is a little hot for kids (but they did like it) so you may want to add hotter spices a little at a time. Also, this is a big batch!! After browning the meat, I combined everything in a very large bowl and immediately froze half. I put the other half in the crockpot and cooked on low for 10 hrs. It was delicious.

Took 1st place at the church chili cookoff with a modified version of this - ditched the red bell pepper, used 3 lbs pot roast and 2 lbs boneless pork rib instead of ground beef - seared the meat first and then baked it a long time so I could pull it appart.  Used fresh serranno pepper as the fresh chili pepper.  Made double bulk in a huge cast iron cauldron.

This is a great chili.  I used turkey sausage instead of Italian sausage and it cut the grease down to just the right amount.  The spiciness was just right for me and my husband.  This is my new chili recipe.

Ok, I'm a born and raised Texan and I would say this is a pretty decent chilli. I'm not sure that all the chopping and prep time was worth it, being that I've had really similar tasting chilli with half the work. I would probably make this chilli again with a few changes. I would use a different cut of meat, probably some chopped steak - although I would keep the Italian sausage. I'd also try substituting some of the tomato juice with beef stock to make it more meaty tasting. I would use about half the beans and mix it up with some kidney beans. I also made a vegan version of this chilli with extra veggies and beans and it was awesome!

Being a Hoosier, I had to try this Boilermaker chili out of curiousity.  As like anything Boilermaker...it was a slight disappointment.  Served this to some fellow chili lovers and we couldn't get past the bacon bits.  I don't know, maybe I am prejudice...perhaps I should put my money where my mouth is and make a Hoosier Chili.  Go IU...fight fight fight!

This is really good chili but did not taste any different than some I 've had.  My family enjoyed it.  I made as directed but left out the cayenne pepper.  With the jalapenos, tabasco and Penzeys chili powder it was spicy enough for us.  I did make this on Saturday and reheated on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  We served it with Fritos, sour cream and grilled cheese sandwiches.

We absolutely love this recipe. I've made it several times adding a few different ingredients. I use ground buffalo and make it even spicier by using jalapenos and habanero hot sauce. Other than that, I stick to the original.

It was wonderful but I agree with other reviews that it wiped out my spice cabinet.  That is the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5.

My husband gave this a 5 star. He was so excited to eat it. He could smell it cooking all day. I think he loved that it was a very meaty chili. I would give it a 5 as well. We didn't make it as spicy though. Noone would eat it if it was very spicy.

Well I'm FROM Texas and this is a GREAT chili!!! It was really easy to make, just cook the meat and onions, drain, and toss the rest in a pot to simmer for the afternoon.   For anyone who complains about the ingredient list, it's pretty much the majority of the savory spices in your spice rack. I didn't really measure (never do) so it didn't take long at all to dump it all in and start it simmering. I did add a splash (tbsp?) of liquid smoke on a whim, but it didn't NEED anything. I didn't have bacon bits so I left that out, but next time I'll toss it in if I have it. Definitely will be making this again, what a hit! Oh and for the 'traditional' feel, try it with sweet cornbread instead of corn chips. SO GOOD!

Awesome! Best chili ever. I made alot of changes.  I used Brats instead of sausage, no beer, no peppers, bacon, beer.  But it was still amazing. My husband agrees it's the best Chili ever.

Only change I made was to use the slow cooker-which I highly recommend. Who knew how tender ground meat could get! I did mine for about 6.5 hrs at high altitude.

This a great recipe! It sounded really hot so I scaled back some the spice and it was still pretty spicy but good. This is a good recipe to play with and see what happens. I added a little Bison meat and red wine for a darker flavor.

This chili was OK on flavor, but not much better than a typical chili dumped out of a can.  It's also very high in fat and salt.  I agree with another reviewer that this leaves you feeling like a brick hit your stomach.

To make this healthier, I substituted 99% fat free ground turkey for the beef and turkey italian sausage instead of pork sausage.  I also omitted the bacon.  Honestly, I was a little concerned that making it so lean would compromise the taste, but we all thought it was delicious!  Could have been a little spicier, but we like spicier food than most people.

This is the absolute best chili I have ever made.  My husband couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  He loves chicken, so I seasoned, sauteed and added some to the chili with the other meats.  Definitely will be making this again!  Great job, thank you!  Kathy Cianci, Tampa FL

I loved this recipe! The whole pot was gone in one sitting and that's a lot of chili! I didn't change a thing! I didn't have any bell peppers at home, so I didn't put any in.. That was the only difference! It was mild enough for the spice haters in the house but it had a nice little kick to it ( I prefer SUPER spicy) I will definitley make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent! I used grnd chuck, italian sausage, and chuck steak for meats. No beans for me. Added fire roasted tomatoes and mild ro-tel in place of diced tomatoes, better than bouillon ( rather than cubes) , real bacon, 1 can green chiles, and a full can of beer. Perfect the first night. Unbeliveable 3 days later as leftovers. Thanks for this recipe.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a hit.  The spices and ingredients are perfect, but you may want to add the chili pepper and hot pepper sauce to taste.  I've made it with no chili peppers and it's still pretty hot from the cayenne and hot pepper sauce.  You can always add more heat later, you can't take it away... Otherwise, this is the best chili I've ever had and my family absolutely loves it.

I made this last night for the first time for a Halloween party.  It had a real kick and everyone enjoyed it.  I added some kidney beans and used the whole beer.  It requires a big pot and reheats beautifully.

This is the BEST chili recipe ever... 2nd time I made it, I made a few changes (just becuase I had the stuff in the house) and the results were even better! Changes I made: increase sausage to 1.5 lb; instead of 1T bacon I use 6 slices (cook it and crumble it); add in a can of corn niblets, use 5 fresh frozen basil leaves chopped up instead of dried basil, and use a whole can of bud (instead 1/2). I cook the chili the night before the game, simmering for 5-6 HOURS (Stir occasionally). Reheat at your tailgate party, and top with shredded cheddar.  YUM!

I made this chili for my daugher's 2nd birthday party.  I made the chili two days before the party and transferred the finished product into a crockppot to be reheated the day of the party.  I followed the recipe exactly and the results were amazing.  Everyone was raving about how good it was!!  It was my first time making chili and it was awesome to hear people request the recipe since chili is one of those dishes that everyone feels they make the best.

I thought this recipe had a great foundation and then I played with it to suit my own tastes. I cooked everything on the stove in a huge pot. I used 1 1/3 lbs. ground chuck, 1 lb. Italian sausage and 1/3 lb. chopped bacon. I did not use bacon bits, real bacon has much better flavor. I only used one 28oz can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of chili beans in medium sauce, 1 15oz can of diced tomatoes and green chiles, 2 jalapenos- 1 seeded, 1 not seeded, 3 cubes of beef bouillion instead of 4 and then did all the spices and veggies the recipe called for and adjusted the spiciness to suit my preference and I thought it was great. I know some people will say to follow the recipe if you're going to review it and I'm sure it's good the way it's written as well, but the fun in cooking is making it your own. Great recipe!

Over the years I have never had a good go-to chili recipe but the search is over after making this chili only once.  I kept the heat to a minimum and omitted the hot pepper and green peppers and thruout the afternoon ended up adding the entire bottle of beer (since I didn't drink it lol)!!!  I cooled it down and put it in the frig until the next day, added a can of tomato sauce and it was just the right consistency.  We only brought home a small portion and received several compliments.  I'll definitely make this again.

This chili is fantastic! It has just the right amount of heat and can be altered to fit your personal taste. I only changed a couple things - I used real bacon crumbles instead of the bacon bits and sauteed the onions in the bacon grease before adding them to the mix. Hey - I'm going for flavor, not health, here! I also added 1/3 cup bittersweet chocolate chips and some fresh cilantro. I also substituted brown sugar for the white sugar. Ooh did it make my tastebuds dance! You will love this recipe - be sure to give it a try!

Phenomenal.  I like my chili a little soupier so I added a little beef broth and cut back on the beans; used ground bison in place of the beef.  My changes didn't change the taste and it tasted great.  It had a perfect heat that let your mouth know, hey bud, that's chili!  But it wasn't an overwhelming heat that stayed with you after you were done.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow. This simmered on the back of my stove for about three hours while we ate curry for dinner last night. Needless to say, the boys couldn't stay out of it and it was dessert. We're REALLY looking forward to dinner this evening- I changed only a few things: one can of kidney beans in place of one can of chili beans, and I only added 1/2 jalapeno as the store didn't have fresh green chilis. It isn't too hot, the spice is great- the taste is really rich and hearty, perfect for the cold weather we've been having. Thanks, totally delicious!

I loved this chili.  I think if you don't like it, it must be that it's not your kind of chili... but in our opinion this is the classic, flavorful chili that chili is supposed to be.  I left out the beer and bacon bits... I didn't want to waste a 12 oz bottle of beer for a half cup of it.  I didn't want to add the entire bottle either b/c we don't like soupy chili... I'm pregnant so I couldn't finish the rest, hubby was working and you can't save beer... soooo I just left it out.  Maybe next time I'll be able to use it.  I didn't have bacon bits or I would have included that too.  Even with out those things included, this was fantastic!  It's thick, not too spicy, tasted great with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese on top.  The kids loved it too... even a 1 year old baby... so that just shows you it's not too hot... but it def. did have a nice kick to it!  Thanks for sharing... we'll be using this often!  It made plenty for my current family of 5 with 2 large containers leftover for another day!!!

This is the BEST chili I have ever tasted!! I left out the Cayenne and chili powder because I ran out, and it was still delish! My husband is more of a picky eater than our kids (ages 5,3,2,1) but he gobbled it up and it wasn't too spicy for the little ones.

This chili was great! Just enough spice but not over the top. I made a batch of homemade french fries then topped it with this chili and shredded cheddar and yummmmm! I had to go back for seconds...I'll start my diet on Monday lol

This went over so well at last weeks football game! It only took an hour to prepare and I let it simmer for about 4 hours then cool over night then re-simmer for another 3 hours or so and it was delicious! I substituted 3.5 lbs. of ground chuck and 1.5 lbs. of sausage in exchange for the beans. I also just used 2 12 oz. cans of beer instead of 1. It was great!

You try it,you will like it.

WHOOYA! THis is Excellent! TY so much for the recipe. When I read the recipe we weren't sure what a "chili pepper" was. After doing some research we bought two serrano peppers. If ya like the ZING, gotta have that BLING! It worked for us but we like spicey! And it's true it gets better as a leftover.

Awesome Chilli recipe. I followed the recipe to a T. The only changes I made was I added more chili powder, 1/2 a cup total and a cup of diced banana peppers. I like my chilli when it bites back. I also served it on a bed of basmati rice. Thanks for the recipe its a keeper. Its also true it does taste better the longer it sits.

Great chili recipe. The only change I made was to cook real strips of bacon in a pan, then saute the veggies in the bacon drippings. Placed the cooked meat and sauteed veggies in a crock pot with all other ingredients and cooked on low for most of the day. My husband raved about it and said I couldnt throw the recipe away...ever! Gave it only 4 stars because it's not the style of chili I prefer. I grew up in southern NM and prefer a hotter, all meat chili like Texas chili. My husbands from Michigan and prefers this style full of "extras".

This is an excellent chili recipe. I added red kidney beans and used a full bottle of beer. Cooked for 6 hours, let cool and then put it in the refrigerator. Severed the next day. Big hit with my family!

I made this yesterday. My grocer didn't have any green chilies so I didn't use them. I also used less cayenne because if it was too spicy then my kids wouldn't be able to eat it. This chili was the BOMB! We all loved it and it tastes even more delicious the next day. I will be making this again.

This is a very good chili, however I have modified the ingredient list as I like a little more heat and intensity with my chili.  I substituted jalapeno peppers and opted to go for real bacon instead of bacon bits.  I found that it worked a little better.  I also simmer the chili for around 4-5 hours to let the flavors marry a little more.  Overall though a great base to start with.

This makes an awesome pot of chili.  Absolutely love it, though I will have to cut down on the spice next time so my two daughters can eat it, they don't like quite so much heat, but the flavor is fantastic!!!  I also might leave out the italian sausage and increase the hamburger, just not a fan of italian sausage.  Otherwise I highly recommend this recipe.

Not sure what the fuss is all about. I followed the recipe to a T and it only was only ok. I prefer 'it's by Chili by George' for a more everyday chili.

I didn't end up following the recipe as written (partially by accident and partially on purpose).  I forgot to buy Italian sausage at the grocery store, so I wasn't able to include that (and I had really been looking forward to it!).  I also left out the hotter ingredients (hot peppers, Tabasco, etc.), since my family are somewhat wimpy about very hot dishes--and it was still PLENTY hot!  I only cooked the chili for about an hour, as opposed to the two hours recommended--we were too HUNGRY to wait!  The finished product was very thick and very, very spicy.  The cheese on top helped to cut the burn a bit.  I enjoyed it and am looking forward to leftovers for lunch today!

Fabulous chili. Even though the ingredient list is long it comes together quickly. I almost-sorta even made it into a healthy chili without too many changes. I omitted the bouillon, replaced the bacon bits with liquid smoke, replaced the ground beef with ground turkey. Also did not serve with Fritos or cheese, and used low sodium canned items. Drained the tomatoes instead of the beans (didn't want to lose that great gravy) and used 3 jalapenos for the chile. This recipe went to the rim of my biggest slow cooker. Started on high to get all that volume up to temp, turned to low and cooked for about 8 hours. I ended up adding more of all the seasonings over the course of cooking. This is a very meaty chili, and next time I make this (which I won't need to for a long time cuz my freezer will be full of it!) I think I will replace one pound of ground meat with more beans. Loved the sausage in this and the blend of flavors.

This was super good. I omitted one can of chili beans and used black beans instead. I also omitted the celery. I used a little more beer than it called for. :)

-skip the italian sausage  I frequently make chili using my family's own recipe.  I decided to try this one and it's REALLY good with 1 huge exception.  I didn't care for the italian sausage and after mentioning it my said she thought the exact same thing.  To me it really pulled down something that could have been incredible.  I even suspected this during preparation, what business does italian sausage have in chili? I don't know.  Other than that, I thought it was incredible.

Made just as recipe is written and we love it. The Italian sausage gives it a great flavor. It’s a lot of chopping and a lot of ingredients, but it’s worth it.

The best chili ever!!  I have made this chili numerous times since finding the recipe.  I do not use beer in any thing I cook, so I left out the beer. Still great...will make again and again and again.......

Made this chili for a pot-luck at work.  All I can say is that they emptied the pot.  They absolutely loved it, multiple comments of, "That's the best chili I have ever had!".    The recipe is very easy to follow and is energy well spent to make.  Let it be known that this is the first time i have attempted to make chili.  The spices were just right for everyone, "Not to hot with just enough bite."  I plan on using this recipe to enter a chili cook-off, like many others have done.  I'm betting that I have a pretty good shot!  Don't have any doubts, this is some good chili.

This was the first chili I have ever made and it was AMAZING! I brought this in for a company chili day and had a lot of people tell me it was their favorite one.  It wasn't too spicy, but still had a kick to it so you know you're eating chili.  Just a note, if you are cooking this in your crock pot, you need to have a big one!  My crock pot was full up to the rim and I had to take out a bowl in order to close the lid.  I made the following changes: 1) used 2 lbs beef chuck steak instead of ground  2) pulled the italian sausage out of the casings, cooked and patted off the oil  3) used 1 can (15 oz) refried black beans with chili peppers in place of one of the chili bean cans (thickens it up nicely) also used 2 cans chili beans w/spicy sauce, but kept the total number of cans the same 4) sauteed all the onions, peppers, and celery before throwing them into the crockpot which gave them a nice, roasted flavor

I tried 8 different chili recipes before I found this one. I only changed the bacon bits to 1 lb of real bacon and kept everything else the same....it has won 4 chili contests so far including a contest in the country of Turkey. The longer it cooks or sits in the fridge the better it gets. I am in the military and I move a lot but this recipe is a hit no matter what part of the US I am in! I love it and highly recommend it to EVERYONE!!!

LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!  I did of course make my own changes but used some other suggestion from other reviewers too.  I omitted the beer and used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup port wine.  I omitted the celery, used the diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the green chiles.  I cooked this in the morning on low for 2 hours then refrigerated till dinner.  I did have to add regular tomato sauce, it was just too thick.  And I used brown sugar instead of white.  This is the best chili ever!!  We make this alot.

Loved this--great flavor.  I left out the cayenne pepper.  I started out using only half of the amount of spices and as the chili cooked, I added more of the spices to my liking.

I received compliments throughout our Super Bowl party on this chili recipe & will be forwarding it to all of our dear friends. Modifications that I made: cut the amount of red & green bell peppers by half; used organic meats which tend to be tastier; substituted one can of spicy organic black beans instead of the last can of chili beans; and only used 1/2 the amount of cayenne since kids would be eating it too.

Along with everyone else, I too made this for the Super Bowl.  It really was fantastic, but I think there are a few things that could be left out and it would still be just as good.  The bacon bits, celery, beef bullion and hot sauce are all not essential.  Also, while the italian sausage adds a nice and interesting flavor, it adds lot of salt to the recipe so it could be left out if needed.  I think pretty much any type of bean would be good with this, so next time I'll try black and kidney to change up the texture.

This recipe is delicious, easy and a real crowd pleaser with my friends. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I used hot Italian sausage instead of the mild one and left out the green bell peppers. Also, instead of cooking it on the stovetop, I cooked it for 4 hours on high heat in a crockpot and it came out perfect. Served it with corn chips tucked into the sides. Definitely keeping this recipe!

This is my favorite dinner. I make it exactly as the recipe says, except I use regular pinto beans instead of pre-seasoned chili beans. I also serve it with sour cream and homemade cornbread instead of chips and cheese. Love!

I have been making this recipe for several years now and never realized that I hadn't reviewed it!  This is our favorite chili!!!  I will not make another chili again!  LOVE THIS!  I use ground turkey and Bob Evans Italian sausage and usually use whatever hot green chili peppers I can find!  I also use more beer than the 1/2 cup that is called for.  I probably use about a cup, but mostly it's to taste.  This is the best chili ever!  My only 'beef' with it is it should have been called 'Hoosier tailgate chili' as I am a Hoosier and hubby is a Boilermaker!

I give the recipe 4 stars because most of it comes out of a can instead of being made from scratch.  That said, it's got a good mix of spices and mine came out great!  I will note I made a lot of changes, though.  For one, I used a slow cooker.  Ingredient wise, I used hot italian sausage, omitted celery, green bell pepper & cumin.  Used 1 cup of beer instead of 1/2.  Also only used 3 cans of beans instead of 4, and I mis-judged the amount of tomatoes; I thought they were supposed to be regular 14oz cans instead of 28oz. This turned out to be a good thing, otherwise there would have been WAY too many tomatoes and beans and not enough meat in the chili.  Plus I don't think my slow cooker would have fit all of it.  The tomatoes I got were fire roasted.  I used just one poblano pepper, though next time I think I'll use two.  Started out with just 1 tablespoon of chili powder though I kicked it up to the full 1/4 cup toward the end.  Also used Duck Butter hot sauce instead of Tabasco.  I let it simmer for the better part of 10hrs and it turned out very good.  Of course letting it sit overnight after that made it at least twice as good.  Really brought all the flavors together; if you don't let it simmer enough it just doesn't taste right.  Overall, very good!

Awesome Chili Recipe! I made a vegetarian version by omitting the meat and adding vergetarian seasoned bratwurst found next to the tofu. Tasted great with alot less fat.

I made this for my family while visiting over the New Year.  It is good, but as it sits two days in the fridge, it gets hotter.  So if you make it for a one day or overnight meal, it's quite good.

This is without a doubt the best chili ever! It's easy to make, though there are a lot of ingredients, and it just gets better and better with age. I made this exactly how the recipe called and it turned out fantastic.

I've made this recipe several times with what I've had on hand and it turned out great each time.  I've used only ground chuck (no sausage) and have varied the seasonings to make it less spicy (omitted the Tabasco, hot peppers).  It always turns out great!  Go Boilers!

Thought this was terrific!  Made it for a playoff game today when friends came over - they all raved about it!  Next time I would use 3 cans mild and 1 can medium beans and cut back on the hot flavors - it was a touch too warm for me!  But otherwise a very good, hearty meal and it went great with cornbread!
Updt 1/11/15 - made a second time, excellent!

The family is amazed by rich, hearty, spicy chili skills!  Extended members are now requesting recipe based on immediate family reviews.  Used 4 slices bacon cooked in dutch oven instead of bits.  Substitued 2 lbs cubed top sirloin browned in bacon grease.  Used spicy ground sausage, but will use sweet next time.  Added a can of chipotle chiles in sauce.  Used 1 can black beans, 2 cans chili beans and 1 can southwest beans.  Used canned fireroasted diced tomatoes.  Used poblano peppers instead of green.  Used brown sugar instead of white.

Made this chili for my family, and honestly we're not big chili eaters.  However, everyone (including my 4yr. old) loved this recipe.  Really good on a cold day or watching a football game!

AWESOME RECIPE!!! Do not review this recipe until you have cooked it slowly for hours, chilled and reheated it again.  The longer the better when it comes to cooking!  This is Delicious!! Melts in your mouth with the perfect "bite" Not too spicy, even my 4 year old liked it, but he likes spicy foods.  I omitted the SALT.  Otherwise Followed recipe exactly. 
Delicious!

Edit : 2012 I still make this amazing chili!! Haven't found a better recipe yet!

Very good.  My husband loved it.  Forgot to add celery, but still tasted good.  Did not add hot sauce as I'm not a fan of super spicy food.  For the multitude of ingredients and work, it was very tasty.

Done this one several times. It's one of the best chili recipes. I agree with many reviewers; for folks with non-discriminating taste, it's hard to justify the effort involved. However, I've made several modifications which reflects the consensus of many reviews and my own spin. Try this one and you'll always get an A+ review by your guests and family.

2 pounds ground beef sirloin (leanest possible)
3/4 pound bulk Italian sausage (boil for 3 min and then cut into small cube)
3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in spicy sauce
2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 large yellow onion, chopped
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
2 poblano peppers, seeded and chopped
1 chili jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
4 cubes beef bouillon
1/2 cup beer
1/4 cup chili powder
2 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon white sugar

Wow, this was fabulous chili.  My neighborhood had a Halloween chili cook-off and I won with this recipe.  There was also a dessert contest which I won with Iced Pumpkin Cookies - also a recipe from this site.  For the chili, I chopped up all of the veggies until they were something close to minced.  I only used 1 tsp. of Texas Pete.  I used Bass as my beer brand.  Instead of three cans drained chili beans, I used 2 drained of the mild chili beans, 1 mild undrained and one spicy undrained chili beans.  The end result had plenty of tongue sizzle even with the less spicy substitutions.  Enjoy and hide the leftovers or they will be quickly gone!

I went with using 2 pieces fresh cooked bacon, crumbled.  I also cut the beans in half (I hate beans...but love chili...and my boyfriend loves them both, so it was a compromise.)  I also used a jalepino and yellow chili pepper rather then 2 green chili's, only because the store was out of greens.  I completely omitted celery.  After browning the meat I threw everything into a crockpot stirred and set for 6 hours.  It tasted fantastic even better the next day.  It seemed a little soupy, mostly because I didn't sub extra meat for the lack of beans...but by cutting the diced tomatos next time or adding more meat I should be good to go.  This was the first time I've ever tried making chili, and though the recipe list for this one is endless...I found it worth it.

Yaow! This is good Chili. Best we've ever made actually. Hubby and I made it last night. Only made a few changes.
Used just under 3lbs of meatloaf mix (ground beef, veal and pork).
used 1 40 oz. can kidney beans, drained and 1 14.5 oz can's goya kidney beans in sauce (didn't say spicy, couldn't find that)
No celery. 1 long hot pepper instead of chile peppers. began by browning about 2 strips of real bacon in the bottom of the pot cut up small, instead of bacon bits. No beer, but used 1 can of diet Dr. pepper.
We made it late last night so my husband could bring it to work for lunch during the week. I wasn't even going to have any before we put it away into containers, but it tasted SO GOOD I had a bowl of chili at MIDNIGHT last night. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I fixed this for a group on Halloween. It was with out a doubt the best chili we have eaten. Didn't have fresh green or red bell pepper so I just used roasted red bell pepper I had in a jar. I also cut up a jalapeno pepper in this. It was not too hot, had a GREAT taste.

Awesome recipe!  This is definitely replacing my old chili recipe.  It made a huge batch (considering there are only 2 of us!) and we froze it to eat later.  I didn't change a thing...perfect as is!

I become a registered user at allrecipes just to rate this recipe! It is FANTASTIC!! By far the very best base I've ever used. I changed a couple of things to suit my family but they were minor.  I exchanged some diced tomatoes for tomatoe juice, used canned green chilies and some different beans.  DO NOT OMIT THE BEER or BOULLION!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I plan on taking it to a cook-off here at work with my slight revisions.

I love this recipe and came very close to following it to a T!  I used four cans of 'mexican style chili beans' since I couldn't find the spicy/non spicy, omitted the bacon bits, and used two cans of tomatoes with green chilis instead of fresh chilis... they were expensive and ugly on the day I went shopping.  I also added two squares of unsweetened chocolate, which I had seen done at a chili cookoff.  Definitely the best chili I've ever had!

I followed the recipe pretty much to a "T" and it was great.  Right before supper, I browned my meat in a skillet, while that was cooking I put the rest of the ingredients in a 5 qt crock pot.  It barely fit, but I managed.  My husband had a bowl around 10pm and raved about it.  Said he couldn't wait to try it after it fully cooked over night.  This chili was so good that I ate a bowl for breakfast while sitting at my desk at work.  So easy....so good!

Absolutely wonderful chili!  I served it to mine and two other families to rave reviews.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (hubby bought wrong tomatoes and beans, but similar) and it came out great.

It won out of 12 pots at a chili cookoff. I still even after winning, am wondering if it was worth all of the ingredients for the results I got.

Mine turned out REALLY soupy.  Also, when it first started to cook, the combination of spices had me reeling it was so good.  but for some reason they faded after two hours instead of becoming more intense.  the whole thing was just underwhelming.

This is easily the best chili recipe I have tried. I did make a few modifications, but this is a great base recipe. Instead of 2 lbs ground beef and 1 lb ground Italian sausage, I used 1 lb ground turkey, 1 lb ground Italian sausage, and 1 lb of stew meat (which makes the chili thicker which I prefer). I also used the juice from only one can of the diced tomatoes, as opposed to using it from both cans as the base recipe suggests. I added an extra 1/4 cup of beer. I think this gives the recipe the perfect consistency, with a better taste. I skipped the celery (seemed odd to put celery in chili) and the green pepper. I used 1 yellow pepper and 1 red pepper which gave the chili a better color, for the presentation. I added a bit more chili powder (maybe an extra tablespoon) and a bit more hot pepper sauce. This gave it the perfect amount of heat; even my semi-picky fiancee said she thought it was perfect. I cooked the chili over low heat for 8 hrs. stirring occassionally, giving the flavors an adequate amount of time to meld. I skipped the Fritos, added the cheese and a bit of sour cream at the end. This was a really good dish that I will make often this winter!

All I know is if you want to follow the recipe exactly but use Jennie O's ground turkey and hot italian turkey sausage instead, it's really not that great.  There's some weird taste going on with it and it can't be the turkey because we've subbed it for beef before in other chili recipes that came out wonderful. We didn't care for this at all. Sorry.

I thought the fat and cholesterol content of this recipe was just out of control so I made a few changes to make it healthier.  Instead of ground beef chuck I used Yves ground round simulated beef.  For those who don't like soy and can't give up the meat, try using ground turkey instead which is only about 1/3rd of the fat and cholesterol.  Instead of regular italian sausage, I used spicy italian turkey sausage.  I also added mushrooms to bulk up the chili and use less of the meat products.  I also cut out the cheese and chips since it tastes great without these extra calorie items.  With these changes, I don't feel so guilty eating this while watching Sunday and Monday football since it makes such a large portion!  Overall, really great taste!

This is indeed great chili!   The only issue I had is by the time it was done cooking, the canned chili beans were disentegrated.  It was barely simmering too so I know the heat wasn't too high.  Next time I'll add the juice of the beans, but wait to add the actual beans until it's done.  Because I always get requests from my husband for "that El Tovar Chili" (awesome Chili at a Grand Canyon Restaurant), I used cubed chuck roast instead of the ground beef.  Be alerted if you do this, it ends up more "soupy".  I guess because the ground beef takes up more space.  We ate this all weekend and we're not tired of it yet!  Tonight I'll freeze the rest after making Taco Salad with this great Chili.   Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!!

My fiancee was in the mood for chili on this rainy, summer day so I decided to try this recipe. WOW! Was I surprised at how well put together it actually is! The flavors meld so well together & althought it was a bit hot for his liking, I was more than impressed. Thank you so much for this outrageous chili recipe, which I am sure will win contest after contest. God bless the person who created this~ Melissa

What a great recipe!  I did vary it a little due to personal preference and availability of ingredients.  I didn't use chili peppers or beer.  For beans, I used two cans of red beans, one can of kidney beans, and one can of refried beans with chilies.  I also halved the quantities of tabasco, cayenne and cumin.  Even with all that alteration it still came out great!  I got 12 good-sized servings out of it, and I'm eatin the leftovers for lunches this week.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to cut the celery a little smaller.  It remained a little crunchy, and it is a little disconcerting to someone who isn't expecting it. ;-)  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome, full body recipe. I split this recipe into two and had half the batch in a slowcooker and the other half in a dutch oven on the stove. I made one really spicy and one sweet. To the spicy, I doubled all the spicy ingredients in this recipe-tabasco, green chiles, etc. To the sweet, I added 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/2 the spicy ingredients listed. All the kids loved the sweet and the adults loved the spicy...everyone was happy! YAY! I served with green onions, fritos and shredded cheddar. The color combo looked awesome!

Great recipe!  Made it with fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Also, could not find "hot chili beans" so substituted kidney beans and black beans + extra spicy peppers to taste.

Outstanding!  Best if made day prior and re-heated next day. Also, made in slow cooker and reheated in slow cooker-the spices blend so well.  This won me 2nd place in the fire dept. chili cook-off. Not bad in a dept. of 500!

I am a newbie to cooking and decided to try this recipe after reading all the reviews. I was a bit intimiated by the list of ingredients but I didn't let it stop me. All I can say is WOW!!! I had to register to this site just so that I could RAVE about this! Prep time was a bit over an hour for me but I had chopped everything...if you have a chopper you can cut down on prep time I'm sure.I made enough to give to my boyfriend and a co-worker and they both begged for more. The only things I did different was that I skipped the beer  (just because I  had none handy) and for the meat I used 1lb hot italian sausage, 1lb mild Italian sausage and 1lb group beef. This has an AMAZING " heat chaser" and such a great flavor. Here it is 2 weeks after I mad my first batch and I am simmering another batch! I defrosted a container from the first batch yesterday  and I swear it's hotter now....the taste gets SO much better. Don't pass this up!

This recipe won 1st place in our school systems chili cook-off.
What great flovor. Here are the changes I made. Instead of 2 pounds of ground chuck I used 1 pound ground sirloin and 1 pound ground venison. I used 4 cans of the spicy chili beans with sauce instead of 3 without and 1 with. I also used a whole bottle of beer.

Way too much spice for us; even my husband that likes things spicy.  I did not use the chiles, and I only used about 3/4 of the chili powder.  Before we shared it I added another can of diced tomatoes and another can of kidney beans to absorb some of the spiciness.  Then it was very good and got a lot of compliments from my husbands buddies at work.
Update -- well I made this again as it sounded like such a good recipe.  I again did not use the chiles; but other than that followed pretty much.  Changes 1) mild italian sausage 2) plain chili beans 3) added a can of tomato sauce 4) added two cans of mexican corn (we like corn in our chili) 5) used 5 strips of bacon chopped up.  FABULOUS Recipe -- nice and thick and hearty.  This time I did use the whole 1/4 cup of chili powder.

Time intensive, but good flavor.   Made this for a chili cook off at work, but did not win.   :o(    Figured I had a shot being in Indiana and working with PU grads.   Oh well.    The noodle soup chili won (is this really chili?).  I will make this again, but will use round steak instead of the hamburger and molasses instead of sugar and maybe a bit of whiskey to help the burn.

This chili is butt - kickin' good!!  I made it almost as presented except I added two jalapenos (including seeds) and doubled the cayenne pepper. This made it ultra tasty, and I deemed it the Buckeye Variation   ;-)  The lesser tolerating palates found solice in using sour cream to tame the heat.  Excellent recipe, thanx!!!

Very good recipe, a little heavy on the bean side for this family, not big fans of the beans.  We use just one can of mild beans, and it turns out just fine.

Hands down the best chili recipe I have ever tried.  Use real bacon instead of the bacon bits.  The secret is to let it simmer (low) for a long long time to let all the flavors meld together.  Make a bunch and freeze the leftovers for later.  It all gets eaten - it's THAT good!

This is a good but not great recipe.  No way is the prep time 30 minutes-I would say closer to an hour.  It makes a TON of chili, so be prepared. I followed all these crazy ingredients to the letter and refrigerated over night and let simmer in my crock pot. I thought it was a little thin and for all the time and expense, I've had much better chili.  Obviously, many others disagree with me.  Must be a lot of Purdue alum out there voting :)!!

We followed the modifications of reviewer Valerie's Kitchen (1/18/08) because my husband can't have really spicy foods but loves chili, go figure.  I used ground turkey instead of beef to cut out some of the fat, left in the green and red peppers and also added some kidney beans for texture.  Finally, I made it in the crockpot instead of a stewpot.  A halved version of this recipe fed 2 people for about 3 days and it was EXCELLENT!!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  I cooked all day on stovetop on low.  It was a pretty chili, lots of colors.  It does have a lot of ingredients which adds to the time for preparing, but well worth it.  One thing, those at the Super Bowl party that were not into spicy (the wimpy ones :>) said that it was a bit spicy for them, but they still liked. So, if you are trying to please folks with delicate palates, you might want to cut down on some of the heat.  I loved it just as is!

Great reviews from the crowd I served the other night.  I only used 1 chili pepper since mine was so large. I don't think using 2 would have made it overly hot though. Chopped my canned tomatoes in the processor just cause I knew I had a couple of guests that aren't big tomato fans.  Will be making this chili many times to come.

I have made this chili 4 times in the past three months.  I always make it when I am having company or for a football game, etc.  EVERYONE LOVES THIS RECIPE!  I made a few changes.  I don't use the green peppers because my boyfriend doesn't like them.  I also spice it up a little with some ground chipotle chili pepper.  I also use cooked bacon instead of bacon bits.  It really adds to the flavor!  I use a little more sugar than what it calls for.  I never make it exactly the same but it always turns out so good.  It is a must, epecially for the big game tomorrow!

This is a recipie that I swear by!! It is by far the best chili that I have ever made and tasted, aside from the hot chili peppers and tobasco I followed this recipie to a tea! I haver made it three times and dozens of people have tried it and loved it! It definatly has to be made a day or six hours before serving to let the spices settle. This is definatly a five out of five! I would highly reccomend it to anyone! Thanks for the great recipie, it is a keeper!:)

This is probably the best chili recipe I've ever used and is deserving of 5 stars.  The whole family loved it.  It had a little bit of a kick, but it wasn't overly-hot.  I followed the recipe to the 't'.

Great recipe, however I found it to be a bit unoriginal and simialr to the other recipes. This is what I did and made it incredibly delicious. Instead of using ground beef and sausage, I used 1lb of lean ground beef, 1lb of ground buffalo and 1lb of lamb shoulder. Follow the original recipe above except omit the celery and instead of the little bit of beer...go ahead and put half a bottle. I used Samuel Adams. It added a great flavor. The lamb turns out very tender and this dish becomes very filling. I made the mistake of making this at the Fire dept and now I have to make it all the time!!!! Its that awsome! Oh and some of the guys placed 1 or 2 place in the chili cookoff and in my opinion, this recipe blows them all away.

I'm not a big fan of Italian sausage so I substituted sirloin chunks instead; otherwise I followed the recipe pretty exactly. Definitely some of the best chili I've ever eaten - and I'm from Texas where that means a lot! ;-)  We froze a bunch of it for the future and I'm sure it will get a bit hotter along the way, but we're definitely looking forward to the next time we eat it! We'll absolutely make it again.

Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you, it's pretty easy. I made this for my family and it was a hit! Everyone said it was the best chili they ever had. Remember, to wear gloves when cutting the peppers.

Loved it!  I made a few changes based on personal pref. I used only 1/2 lb. Italian sausage to try and cut a bit of fat. Used only 1 can of diced tomatoes and subbed a can of tomato sauce for the other. My kids prefer more sauce and less chunks of tomatoes. I used one can of kidney beans in place of one of the cans of chili beans to just add some texture and color. Omitted the celery, red bell pepper, chile peppers, bacon bits and tobasco (sorry we are wimps). Reduced the chili powder to 2 Tbsp. (holy cow 1/4 cup is A LOT!). With these changes everyone at my table loved it. I served it with shredded cheese, chopped green onion, chopped tomato, sour cream, and tortilla chips. I think the leftovers will make great nachos.  Important note - with my mods it fit perfectly in my dutch oven which is what I always use to make chili. If you make it as written be sure to use a stock pot as directed or it will never fit. It will make a very large amount.

I made this for a group of people we had over and everyone loved it.  I'll make this again.  I had to change a few things because I was out, such as spicy beans and chili peppers.  I substituted the spicy beans with regular chili beans and some rotel with green chilis.  It still came out wonderful, so don't be afraid to tweak it to your taste.

This is the best chili ever!! I made it for a party and everyone really liked it. The only thing I would do different is just use  spicy sausage instead of Italian, I found the Italian one had  a fennel taste to it.

This chili is one that I have made and is certainly a tried and true recipe. My mom has since borrowed the recipe from me and made it for friends to only rave reviews!! Amazing!!

I was definitely skeptical about this recipe.  I've never heard of adding celery and fresh peppers to a chili recipe. I was also leery because if this turned out to be a flop I had a lot of money tied up in the ingredients. Thank goodness it turned out!  I cooked the meat on the stove and then threw it and the other ingredients in the crock pot on high for 2 hours.  It was REALLY thick when it started cooking, but as it cooked down it was the perfect consistency.  This is a keeper!

Delicious and it freezes so well. I cut out the jalepeno and I cut back the hot sauce (too spicy for me) but this has become a winter staple in my house.

This is a very good combo you can adjust it to your liking. I used 1 lb ground chuck and 1 lb chuck tenderloin (stew meat). I love the added texture! I also thought it was odd (for lack of a better word) that the two distinctive ingredients (beer & bacon) were in such a low amount. So, I tossed in about a half cup of chopped crispy bacon and a whole can of beer (and I think the stuff is disgusting as a beverage!). The beer cooked off nicely and I love the smokiness of the bacon. I used 3 cans diced tomatoes with green chiles and left out the other spicy ingredients. It's easy to add the extra spiciness on an individual basis.

This recipe was fantastic.  Perfect amount of spice.  When I make it, I prepare it the night before and put it all in the slow cooker pot and then refrigerate it.  The next day I put it on low in the slow cooker before I go to work and 10 hours later...it is the best chili I have ever had. The first time I made it, we were having company on a Friday night and everyone was blown away by the flavor. I have had to send the recipe to everyone. My son (11 year old) was disappointed when he found out I was making chili then after eating this...he was disappointed that we had run out because EVERYONE went back for seconds! Thanks, thanks, THANKS for sharing!

This recipe is amazing!
I have to admit that I made a few changes though. I've never been a huge chili fan, but this felt like a fun recipe to tackle and I was making it for people who do love chili.
I personally don't like very chunky chili, so I put all the veggies (peppers, onion, celery, and tomatoes) in my Cuisinart and made a pulp out of them.  They gave the chili a great flavor but in a smoother sauce.
I browned the meat on the stove and then threw it in my crockpot (5-qt for the full recipe) with all the other ingredients. I cooked on high for about 3-4 hours. 
Other than that, I stuck to the recipe.
Fantastic! The Nittany Lions approve :)

This is a great Chili so come on and cook it up. The only thing I found to
be a little off is the serving size.
The serving size says for 10 but it seems
to me that it would feed 30 unless boilermakers are real big people.

Fantastic!  I have enough food to feed a football team!  I love spicey food but my husband is a big whimp.  I made it as written and it did not have too much spice for him at all!  I did add some extra hot sauce right before I ate it.  You have got to try this!

This is by far the best chili recipe I've ever made!!! I won 1st place in a chili cook-off and no one could believe there was chocolate in it.  I too cooked it the day before in a slow cooker and just warmed it up the next day.  Seems to be a lot more flavorful that way.  I occasionally omit the celery and it's fine without.  I think you could probably get away with throwing a lot more stuff in this one and still have the great flavor.

Chili doesn't get any better than this. I left out the sugar, salt and found I didn't need the tomato paste. Used a whole can of beer, added in a half cup of strong coffee and a quarter cup of baking cocoa. Fabulous way to welcome in the Fall season! Thank you!

changes:  i used broth instead of beer, no hot pepper sauce, no salt.  it was just a little too spicy for me (i dont like my nose to run when i eat), but just perfect for my husband.  the chile was excellent, i have to say!  the only thing i didnt like was all the prep work - took a long time.  seemed like there were way too many ingredients and i dont know if all of them were necessary.  but that being said, i will make it again because it was very tasty!  thanks for the recipe.

I would definitely recommend this recipe to others; I felt that the flavors were good and absolutely memorable.   I added 1 can of tomato paste (2 cans in total) to the recipe; I thought the consistency was a little loose without the additional paste.  Because of the added acidity from the additional tomato paste I also added a few more teaspoons of brown sugar (3tbs in total).  Even though I am not a chili fan, I will keep this recipe in my arsenal to use at a later date!  Update 2: I used a 12oz of tomato paste, 28 oz of diced tomatoes, 28 oz of petite diced tomatoes, 1 tsp. italian seasoning, 4 tablespoons of chili powder, 2 jalapeno chilis, 1 serrano chili, no beer, 2 cans of mild beans, 1 can of zesty chili beans, 3 teaspoons of brown sugar, 4 chicken bullion cubes and the rest of the ingredients were the same.  I let it simmer for 2.5 hours, put it in the fridge overnight and the next day and then served it.

This chili is wonderful. I thought it was good after all the ingredients were mixed together even before it simmered for two hours.  I was out of basil so I substituted Italian Seasoning, used 3 teaspoons of beef base plus 4 cups of water instead of the beef boullion, used Hot Italian Sausage and green Tabasco instead of red.  Also, used 2 red bell peppers and omitted the green bell pepper.  This chili is the best.  I will definitely make it again.  It only took me about an hour to prepare.  It's not as difficult as the list of ingredients leads you to believe.

This was probably the best chili I have ever had!  My family agreed.  It's kind of traditional, and the combination of ingredients appeals to any man (i.e., sausage, beef chuck, beer) so my husband was happy to cook it.  He used the stock pot first, then the crock pot.

THIS CHILI ROCKS!!!!!  I use 2 lbs ground sirloin in place of the ground chuck. Two cans of spicy chili beans (1 undrained) and 2 cans of medium spicy beans (drained). We like our chili SPICY, so I use 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, 2 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. I also use 1 habanero, seeded and diced, in place of the green chiles. Dark beer works best, and I prefer Fat Tire. For the hot sauce I use Frank's Extra Hot and Tobasco Habanero.

This is the best chili I have ever had!  Everytime I serve it someone ask for the recipe.  We are converted!   This chili has a kick but it is soooo good! This is the only chili my family wants now!  My kids love it ages 12,7&5.  They don't normally like spicy food but they enjoy this! I don't add the green chilis and I leave out the celary (personal taste).  It makes enough to freeze and freezes well.  I tried to make this in my crock pot the first time and had to switch it all to a LARGE soup pot.  It is well worth the work!!

lots of time/ingredients but worth the effort.  I added steak and substituted real bacon for the bacon bits.

This is great stuff. I used the slow cooker (13 hrs on low) method and it 
turned out great. Should be a big hit today. GO BEARS

Made this today for the Superbowl tomorrow. I did 1 lb. lean ground chuck, 1 lb fresh ground italian sausage and 1 lb stew meat diced into smaller pieces. Also added a fresh jalepeno and one whole bottle of beer. 
My husband is a chili fanatic and said it was great. I went into the kitchen and found half the huge pot already gone, apparently the kids loved it too. Not much left for the game tomorrow! 
Go Bears!

YUM, I'm not a fan of chili, but I am now.  I changed the serving size to 6 and left out the peppers.  AWESOME
I did add more beer and more broth (you'll need to eye ball it) Next time I think I'll cut back just a touch on the tabasco sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe

I made this for a family party and after dinner not even one bean was left.  This is a great recipe and when I make it again I will not change anything.  Wonderful recipe - and this is coming from a IU grad!

The best "Chili" recipe I've had in 20 years, just outstanding!  My Brother Jon made it for the the Chicago Bears NFC title game for 2007, and in a (Crock Pot) for longer desired simmer.  ALL enjoyed it very much!  Under recipe reviews for Cook: (MEMONS) post on 1/14/2007 reduced ingredients in providing to much spicy zip, and I agree.
Also Cook (kate) posted on 1/16/2007 who slowly simmered it on Saturday and let it heat up in the crock pot on Sunday, I also agree in the long simmer and serving the next day.
My Brother Jon, took out some of the ground chuck and substituted beef stew meat which was a also a desirable change otherwise he followed the recipe, with exception of using a Crock Pot instead on high for 10 hours.

This was delicious!  
Used all Ground turkey for the meat.
Left out the green chiles, but used extra hot rotel for some of the tomatoes.
Substituted beef broth for the beer.
Left out the bacon bits.  
This definatly has some kick to it, but it tastes great!

I made this for our office Chili 
Cook-Off and came in 1ST! There were 7 other chili's. I used real bacon crumbles as someone else suggested and left out the Tabasco as I didn't know how hot it would make it. I used a serrano pepper and 2 Jalepeno peppers for the green chiles. Start off with a 1/2 tsp of salt and add more as you go(after you've tasted it), mine came out a bit on the salty side with the 1 tsp of salt. This chili had the best flavor out of all 7 that were at the chili cook-off. It didn't taste like a bunch of meat, beans and chili-powder. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! If you don't have the spices on hand, shop at Whole Foods or Central Market where you can buy just what you need. It will help reduce the cost significantly.

Excellent!!  Since all members of my family, excepting myself, refuse to eat anything spicy, I cut the chili powder down to just 1 tablespoon and the cayenne pepper down to a teeny tiny 1/4 teaspoon.  Everyone (even the 2 yr old) went back for seconds, and we're looking forward to it for lunch today.    I had no problems with the multitude of ingredients; I thought it was fun using so many different ones!  Also, I was a little concerned about the italian sausage, but it blends in beautifully.  This is probably going to become a cold-weather-regular in my home!

This was one of the best chili recipes I have ever tried.  The only thing I changed was cutting back on some of the spicy.  Unfortunately I am a pepper belly but hubby isn't.  My 8 year old even liked it.  I'll be making this for one of our friend's upcoming Christmas parties.

Made this Chili in a relatively short period of time....  I liked that it was quick and easy.  I added extra hot sauce since I myself did not find that it was all that hot (matter of preference).  The adding of Frito's wasn't quite necessary in my opinion. And next time I believe I will use green onions instead of yellow.  All and all it was a tasty (especially the next day) meal!

I won! Calk another winner up to this recipe. I won our Firefighter chili cook off this evening. I followed the recipe on everything except that I cut the chili beans down by a third. I think the Beef bouillon seperates this from of the more tomato tasting chilies there.  I like the slow burn that hits after you finish each bite.  The Fritos add a lot to the flavor as well.

This is a good one.  I omited the celery, and tabasco (figured if it needed more spice I could always add it later. On day one was very good.  Day too almost too spicey to eat.  On day three the flavors had mellowed and it was quite tasty!  I entered it in a chili cookoff and won the "best chili" category -- it was a small gathering of friends and there were 5 chilis to compete with.  Will make again. It is similar to my old chili recipe with the bacon (which by the way I made with real bacon)  Very good!   Thank you for sharing!

I made this Chili for my family and a few of our friends and it was a great big hit. Everyone loved it. It's a kinda spicy so if you're not into spicy foods it might not be for you. But I highly recommend it! Thanks A lot! I'll definately be making this chili again soon!!

I didn't change a thing and this chili was incredibly delicious.  I will be making it again and again and again...as recommended by others, I also made the homesteader chili found on this site and they went perfectly together.

I made this Chili for company and they liked it.  Some of the kids really liked it to.  However you have to like spicy food to really appreciate this chili because it is hot, I did cut down on some of the hot pepper sauce and the chili powder, and it was still quite hot especially for my father who normally does not eat very spicy food.  My sister in law suggested adding carrots, one more veggie in there, sounds good.

I did not have Italian sausage or a red pepper on hand so just used all ground chuck and only the green pepper called for in the recipe.  Was still really good and next time will try w/ all ingredients called for and will more than likely enjoy all the more.  Being a fellow BOILERMAKER and getting the recipe from a Purdue fan made it even better!!!

I tied for 1st place at a chili cookoff with this recipe.  I changed a few things slightly. I omitted the chil beans in spicy sauce, the red bell peppers and the green chili peppers.  I also forgot the chili powder but doubled the amount of minced garlic (maybe even tripled). I cooked 3 slices of bacon and crumbled them into the chil (for 20 servings).  Finally, I used seasoned diced tomatoes- 1/2 with basil/garlic/oregano and 1/2 with mild chili peppers IN ADDITION TO the spices listed.  Many people mentioned that it was a little sweet, which they liked and I did not(matter of personal preference) and said it was not spicy- which I disagee with- it was the kind of spice that sneaks up on you.

Excellent chili recipe.  The long ingredients list makes it look more challenging than it really is.   I used about 3x the beer and a can of whole peeled tomatoes (in the blender) in place of one of the diced tomato cans.  I also added about double the cayenne and chili powder and gave it a little kick.  Make this chili and you'll like it.

This is the best chili I have ever made! Tripled the recipe for a 4-H fundraiser and got several compliments from "customers" that this was the best chili they had ever eatten.  A couple parents/grandparents who are involved with the 4-H club wanted to take home the leftovers (if their was any).

Really Good chili. I made a few adjustments to make it low fat. I omitted the sausage and the Fritos. This chili was a little spicy for my taste and I only put a small can of mild green chiles (omitted the two fresh ones) and only used about Tablespoon and half of the Chile powder.

This is an excellent chili recipe.  I didn't have any hot peppers on hand, so I used a 4 ounce can of diced chili peppers.  Though I limited the hot sauce to one teaspoon instead of two, it was still much too hot for my mother-in-law.  My wife said it was a little too hot even her.  I thought it was hot, but not unbearable.  "I like-a spicy meatball."  Since it's unfair to downgrade the recipe based on a substitution I made, I'm rating this a five until I try it again exactly as written.  Clearly, it's a good recipe.  The heat can be easily modified for individual and family tastes.

Fabulous!  Never made chili before, and was searching for a recipe that would incorporate a few different methods of chili-making....and this was perfect.  I did leave out the beer (didn't have any on hand - shame on me!), and also left out the italian sausage.  

I also subbed beef broth for the beer and buillion, and wound up doubling up on the broth as the chili cooked off rather dry (I like a little moisture in my chili).  This turned out perfectly and I had to resist eating the whole thing.  Thanks!!!

My husband and I made this for Superbowl Sunday.  Needless to say it was a big hit.  
We cut back on the beans (we both aren't too keen on them) and spices.  We figured if someone wanted it hotter, they could add extra hot sauce themselves.
Turned out great.  The cheese and frito toppings were excellent!  Also added a dollop of sour cream on top.  Who knew toppings on chilli would be so great!
Would make this again for any big-game day.

By far the best Chili recipe I have ever made! I prepared everything at 9PM the night before, stuck it in the crock pot on Low and let it go until the Superbowl at 2PM the next day. SOOOO good! Also - used ground turkey and turkey sausage and no one noticed.

This is a very spicy chili. I made it for my grown family. The men folk liked it better than I did. Only one of the other women were able to eat it.  I only used 2 tablespoons of chili powder, no Tabasco or chilies and it was still quite a bit over spiced. Thanks for sharing this recipe, but I think I will continue to use my old standard recipe and let the guys spice up their own bowls with pepper sauce, saving my taste buds from such a firey dish.

I loved this recipe.  Although, I did not put in any of the peppers, excpt the chili peppers.  Nobody here likes their taste.  I also skipped the cayenne pepper, all but 2 of us dislike spicy!  The longer I simmered the chili the more tender it became...it was incredible!

I made this for my husbands Monday Night Football group and they loved it. There was none left over which disappointed me because I wanted some. 
I did not have minced onion, so I used fresh, I substitued 2 cans of diced tomatoes of 1 of the larger whole tomatoes and did not have any sausage so I made it with just cubed steak and ground beef. I am making it again today for the family so that I can have some!!

First and foremost, Great chili recipe! The heat is nice and mild in my opinion, so good for many people, and has great flavor. Iv made it a couple times now and there are only a couple things I would change to suit my liking.  This recipe gets a little soupy for my liking when all the veggies cook down, so I added an extra half lb of beef and drained the diced tomatoes. That helped thicken the chili up to my liking. I would def. Make it again.

5 star for taste! Everyone loved it. If you’re using the Allrecipes app watch out for shopping list feature. It changes some measurements of ingredients. The diced tomatoes and onions where more and I didn’t reread the recipe sizes. The tomatoes and onions added a lot of extra “juice” that I filtered out and simmered a lot longer to get the right consistency. If I didn’t have that problem it would have been perfect.

This is my all time favorite chili recipe. Next time I make it I plan to use stew meat and maybe Cajun sausage. May add corn. But the way the recipe it, it is the very best.

I am not a chili kinda gal but THIS chili is fantastic.  My bf loves chili and so this is my go to when the weather is cold, which is most of the time here in Alaska.   I also do not go back to a recipe, generally.  I like to try new things and expand my culinary skills but this chili recipe I have made several times.

I made this last night and waited this morning to try it so the flavors had time to get together.    I did not change anything and made as written.   There were so many 5 star ratings and contest winners I figured this was a no brainer. The taste was just okay, I definitely won’t be making it again but I am glad I tried it

Very good and palatable. Some of the comments on here  suggest that chili has to be so Spicy that it is almost uneatable.  These are mostly our Texas friends who have no appreciation for good food. That’s why they kill the taste with hot sauce

Amazing!!  Great recipe!  
Being a Minnesotan of Scandinavian descent, I simply don't have things like Tabasco lying around...most Norwegian food is white and bland (lutefisk, lefse, kringla, fattigmund, etc).  I cut out most of the spices like the fresh jalapeno, mostly because I didn't have the money / desire to run to the grocery store. To make up for that slightly, I added some red pepper flakes. 
Since I also didn't have any tomato paste,  for the base I added in a Family size can of cream of Mushroom soup (any other cream of ___ soup could work also).  So the color isn't exact, but it's a pretty close match.  Really tastes good, and made enough to freeze and reheat! Thanks for this recipe, MightyPurdue22

I made this for my father as a Christmas gift (he doesn't cook and eats most of his meals out).  He cannot stop raving about it - says its the best he has ever eaten! 

I am not going to deny - I am kind of a food snob and as a first attempt it was pretty delicious.  I like a little more heat on my chili and I will definitely make this again and will spice it up in my own kitchen.

Didn't have the tomato paste and left out the sugar, but it was still a hit.  I'll follow it to a T the next time.

This was a great chili to make, the only change I made was I added a lb of homemade chorizo. It turned out awesome & it was the chili I took to our chili cook off in our lil town of Joseph, OR & believe it or not after my 3rd year of entering, I won 1st Prize from the blind judges. Thank you for sharing your reciepe.

I made this in a crock pot for a cold Sunday afternoon of watching the football game. It was perfect! I took some of the suggested changes: I used 1 lb. stew beef instead of sausages, I increased it to 1 cup of beer, a little less chili powder and I omitted the bacon bits. Delish!

Delicious chili. Didn’t have beer so substituted a little water didn’t have hot pepper so used a little extra Texas Pete. Was plenty spicy.  A rich and meaty chili the family loved with a dalop of sour cream and homemade cornbread!

Outstanding! Instead of the chili peppers I used 4 misc. hot peppers from the garden. Won the chilli cook off, beer pong and I got a coupon for a 4 day pass from the dog house. Pretty sure I think there’s a chance I saw my wife probably smile... or she might just have gas. No other changes to the recipe. This goes in the fav’s!

I’ve made this recipe over 10 times. The chili is the best I’ve ever had. The first time I made it, I left out the chili peppers and bacon, and I’ve left out those ingredients ever since because it was so good and I didn’t want to disrupt the recipe.

Perfect chili if you like it meaty and medium spicy.  I simmered for three hours and it was totally worth it!  The flavors were well blended and robust.  Nothing but good to say.

I have been making this chili for over 5 years. I have followed the recipe to the T and made substitution based on lack of ingredients or other issues. It has tasted great each time. The best substitution is the replacement of beef with venision!

Great recipe. I cooked the meat in my crock pot on high and left the fat in. I substituted 2 cans of chili beans for (1) 15oz can of black beans and (1) 15oz can of red kidney beans for better texture. I also omitted the celery because I did not have any and it turned out fine. Lastly, i cook the chili for at least 6 hours and let cool on "keep warm" overnight. Enjoy!

I was looking for a new chili recipe to try, after reading all the reviews I decided to give this one a go.  I followed the ingredients and cooking instructions and it turned out great.  The flavor was awesome as was the texture.  The only thing I'm going to change is the celery and bell peppers.  Here in the south I've never heard of celery in chili.....so from now on I'll be leaving this out of my dish.  I gave it 4 stars just because of that, but it's a great recipe!

It  was terrific!!! The only thing we changed was the name as I went to Indiana U and am not a fan of the Purdue University Boilermakers. We renamed it Hoosier Chili. Our football crowd loved it and the Packers won!

UPDATE OCT 2018:  PLEASE MAKE THIS! my husband just ate it again and I quote "The flavor, the spice,  I don't want to share this with anyone!"......Don't let the long ingredient list stop you from making this.   It's completely worth the effort!

I make this all the time and have previously reviewed it.  Last time I made it I subbed fresh chorizo for the Italian sausage. Amazing!  otherwise I always make this recipe as written. I use Guinness as the beer.  One of my fave ever recipes found online!!

I have been making this recipe for a few years. My family won't eat any other chili! We take it to our Halloween chili cook-off every year and it always get's rave reviews! We sometimes substitute buffalo burger for the hamburger. Either way it's one of our favorite fall recipes!!

I have made this many times. I never measure anything in this. I just have fun and be creative. I often add red wine, and different hot sauces, sometime sub in some ground turkey. Just have fun. I just made this again and add some chopped carrot. simmer for a few hours before adjusting the spices. Another thing I did last time is I sautéed my veggies first. Hell what is wrong with more bacon? I put in half a pound.

Absolutely brilliant!  I read the reviews and how people tweaked it! I added the stew meat and sausage and got rid of the water and upped the broth- I doubled this recipe and it froze beautifully- I made some Chipotle Cornbread and  had a salad on the side- everyone RAVED about it!!  Make this bad boy today!!  Delish!! Everyone asked for the recipe!! Thanks for making me look like a rockstar!! :)

Great recipe.  I cut back on the chili powder, (my family doesn't like it too spicy) 1 tablespoon instead of 1/4 cup.  I don't drink beer, so I used apple juice instead. Added 12 oz can of V-8 juice.  Otherwise made the recipe as written.  Fantastic!!!!!

I've made this many times. It is by far the best chili i have ever had. I do add almost twice as much of all the veggjes and 2 cans of drained slice mushrooms. 
  It looks like alot of ingredients but really doesn't take long to prepare, its all worth it. 
  I usually end up freezing about a 3rd of it, it freezes really well.

I had really high hopes for this chili considering all the great ratings. The only changes I made were using venison for the meat and halving the ingredients since I was making a smaller portion. I have to say, I've made better. Anyone who makes changes to the recipe shouldn't be rating it 5 stars because then it wasn't perfect as is.

With this many reviews mine may be pointless but I'm chiming in any way.  I just made this for dinner tonight and it's soo good!  Definitely too spicy for my preschooler but my husband will love it!  I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe exactly.  I checked it after 2 hours, and then again after 3 hours, but didn't need to add or adjust at all.  Can't wait to have a huge bowl of this for dinner tonight!

This one is a winner!!!! The only changes I made were 2 lb venison, 1 lb pork and 1 lb beef. I asked my Hubby to add 1/2 c beer and he added a whole can. It was still one of our favorite chilli recipes.

Yummy! However, the Boilers in this household are a bit whimpy when it comes to spiciness. So for my family, I replaced the spicy chili beans with kidney beans and added a small can of tomato sauce. Also eliminated the jalapeño pepper. Everything else was the same. I also did this in a crockpot on low for 6 hours. I did find that the chili was not as thick as we like it, so in the last 1/2 hour I added another can of tomato sauce with 4 tablespoons of flour mixed in. It ended up thick and yummy, with just a little kick. A sprinkling of cheddar and dollop of sour cream....yum! Added sour dough rolls....perfection! BOILER UP!

This recipe has changed the way I make chili forever! What a great recipe! My family ate it with great enthusiasm, and the hint of serving cheese and Fritos with it was superb.  Served it with cornbread and rice, as well. Everyone had fun with it, and I have to say it was the best chili I've ever had.

I've been wanting a break from my normal recipe, so I made this tonight. This isn't a bad recipe, it just wasn't for us. The only things I changed was using all spicy beans (instead of the 3:1 ratio of regular chili beans to spicy) and I used Melinda's hot sauce instead of Tabasco. We like heat (still wasn't hot enough for us). I'd say besides the lack of heat, which is easily remedied with a little Carolina Reaper powder, our only complaint was the Italian sausage. To us, it dominated the flavor and just didn't scream "chili" to us. However, it isn't bad, so give it a shot!

Who am I to say 4000+ people rating this recipe  are wrong, but I will say to each  there own...

If I said all the changes I made, after I tasted the end result...it would no longer be this recipe. I will never stray from my chili recipe ever again.

It is what they claim it to be--the best ever!!! Got lots of rave for it and friends were still talking about it days after.  I did have to tone down the heat--skipped the pepper and served the tabasco on the side-- but still too spicy with the full measure of chili powder indicated.  This was helped with and extra can of kidney beans, the optional condiments of sour cream and shredded sweet potato.  I am making this again for church potluck per request. This will be my go to chili recipe

I absolutely LOVED this recipe, as did everyone that tried it.  There wasn't a drop left!  I followed the recipe almost exactly and used every ingredient except the beer (I don't drink, so didn't have any on hand), but I honestly don't think it would have made a difference.  I'm sure it's just as delicious either way!

Love this recipe but it's a little too meaty for me so I usually use it as a base recipe  that I add a bunch of veggies and stuff to. 

I add: 
1 package of corn / 2 extra peppers / 1 extra celery stalk /1 extra can of tomatoes/ instead of chili beans I use 2 cans unstrained kidney beans and 1 can strained black beans.

We love this recipe! Have made it multiple times and always make enough to share with family!  Only modified 1 thing. We choose to have the 1 can of navy beans, 1 can of kidney and 1 can of pinto instead of the 3 cans of chili.  Still use the 1 can of spicy chili though.  It's wonderful!!

Did not use beer and chips. This is hands down the best Chilli I've made and eaten, the flavor is simply amazing. I would recommend this to everyone especially those who haven't had Chilli before so they know what it should taste like.

This is a great recipe to use as your base recipe for chili. Add or subtract which ingredients that suit your palate :)

To be fair, I had to make changes based on what I had on hand. I used all ground beef as I had no sausage. I didn't add tomato paste because I only made a half batch since it was just hubby and I and I didn't anticipate using the remainder soon. I added some frozen corn because that's how I like my chili. We always top our with shredded cheese for extra flavor. It packs some heat, but oh my gosh, this was absolutely amazing! I know it'll be even better tomorrow! I made Pap's Walter's Cornbread (recipe also on here) to go with it and I doctored it up with diced jalapenos and frozen corn.

This is the best Chili ever! I have made this for years, and everyone loves it.  My mother in law just called me husband and asked when I was going to make chili again so she can come over for a bowl! 5 star! (I always modify depending on what I have on hand, and its a hit everytime)

This makes the best chili my family has ever had.Fooled around with it a little but followed it pretty closely. Please ignore the Texas lobby that insists chili should be an insipid bean free gravy. This is good hearty Midwest chili great with grilled cheese, crackers, or macaroni.

My husband loves this chili.  I make it as written except for using jalepeno peppers (usually 2-3 of them).  He and I are the only two in our family who will eat chili.  I always make the full recipe and freeze the extra in individual containers.  He takes it to work for a quick and tasty lunch.  I made a batch for my in-laws this past weekend. They said it was the best chili they had ever had. That's means a keeper in my book!

Our "go to" chili recipe with a few alterations to our taste and preference. We use poblano and anaheim peppers vs chili peppers. We do not use bacon bits but saute and chop an entire pound of smoked bacon (I know, I know... trust me though) One whole tall can of guiness vs half a cup. We switch up the beans mix and use some nontypical types. 1 can of each, chili beans, garbanzos, and black beans (I am not a huge bean fan so we lose one can and switch them up as a compromise between me and my husband) . As for all the rest of the ingredients we leave them as is. Don't be afraid to fuss with this very versatile recipe to make it just right for you.

Best chili I ever made! 
I use a small can of green chilis instead of fresh. I alter the spiciness by either using hot Italian sausage (for lovers of hot) or cutting the cayenne amount in half. (for serving grandkids). Depends on who we are cooking for. I add bacon bits if I have them but it does not seem to make a big difference.

Let me start with this disclaimer:  I am a decent cook, have a terrible tolerance for spicy foods (though I love them), and have never made chili before. 

I followed this recipe to the tee, except used 1 jalapeno in lieu of both hot peppers. After only an hour of simmering, this dish tasted wonderful. It had plenty of umami and the italian sausage gave the flavor a huge boost. The heat was just right for me, hot with a little lingering but not overpowering as to take away from the flavor.  The flavors mixed like it had been simmering for a day or two already...I can't imagine what this is actually going to taste like after that time. 
Not everyone is going to like the level of heat, but AT MINIMUM this is an awesome starting recipe. Cater it to what you like. I'll be making this again. And don't listen to the negative reviews, unless you're a food snob, you'll at least enjoy this succulent chili.

Update:  This recipe won 2nd in my company cook off out of 30 entries!  I used Magic Hat #9 for the beer. 

Update2:  I made the following additions the second time I made this, based on what I like and the feedback from my company cook off. 
Original -> Change
1 Jalepeno seeded -> 1 Jalepeno & 1 Serano w/seeds
2 Large garlic cloves -> 2 Medium garlic cloves
Beans:  2 kidney, 1 pinto, 1 hot -> 1 pinto, 2 hot
Tomatoes not drained -> Drained tomatoes in strainer
2 tsp hot sauce -> 4 tsp hot sauce
1 tsp cayenne -> 2 tsp cayenne

The heat on the second batch is still manageable for us

Make this recipe!  Absolutely Wonderful- melts in your mouth! We come from a family who participate in chili cookoffs and this one is a winner!  Every time I make this my guests are raving about it.  I follow it nearly to the "T".  The only difference is I use REAL bacon (about 1/2 pound, chopped and sauteed) and ground italian sausage instead of links.  You can always adjust the  amount of spicy ingredients, even omit them if your sensitive to spicy.  It does not jeopardize the greatness of this chili!

Added extra can of diced tomatoes, whole bottle of beer.
Added extra jalapeno pepper, used 1 can of spicy pinto beans, 1 can spicy black beans, 1 can of light kidney beans and 1 can of dark kidney beans all drained.
Also added one tablespoon of spicy brown mustard.
Didn't add jalapeno seeds.
Made for a Halloween party, everyone loved it and came back for second helpings.
Made another batch to have at home, tastes even better the next day.

I won GRAND PRIZE!  This was an awesome chili!  I made it and the only changes I made was only 1 jalapeño pepper instead of two, no cayenne pepper, and I used ground turkey instead of ground beef/chuck!  I entered it into a chili cook-off contest and won grand prize!  It's so yummy!  Def will make again!

We made this on Sept 24, 2015. Some changes - one pound of spicy hot pork sausage not italian.  For the beans 1 can dark red and one can light red kidney beans and 1 can chili beans mild.  3 cans total. 2 Ancho pasilla peppers instead of green chili peppers, dried and prepared (toasted, soaked and then scraped out).  four slices of bacon crisp and crumbled. 4 t. of better than boulion beef, instead of cubes.  Busch beer,  and used the green pepper tabasco sauce (not as hot)  Just a little cayenne pepper - its really hot! 1/4 t. or less! Now we need to wait a few hours and see...or days according to some of the reviews!

Basically followed recipe othan using 3 cans baked bean and one kidney beans plus added a can of green chilis.  I didn't have any bacon bits but I am sure that would have made this recipe even better.  Hubby loved it, a keeper for sure!

Awesome!  Made this for a large group of people and everyone loved it and commented on it over and over again.  I never knew to make it the day ahead and then reheat it the next day.  I will be sure to do this from now on.  This is now my go to chili. Thank you!

Love this recipe I did everything the same besides the beans I used two cans of red kidney beans, one can of mixed beans and a can of chic peas. Used diced tomatoes and put them in the blender before dumping it in the pot. And used 2 jalapeno peppers and for the hot sauce I used red hot slamming chili sauce. In the end the recipe has a nice kick to it but not super hot :). Will be making this again.

I made this two days in a row and both days I got a 10 star rating.. I omitted the hot peppers ,bacon and the beer cause I didn't have any. I cooked the beef and sausage then the veges on the stove top and then just added everything to the slow cooker.6 hours later. AWSOME.everyone  I served this to said it was the best chili they ever had.thanks so much, this is a keeper.

Made this for a chili competition I was hosting and it won!! I finally won! My changes: I left out the sausage and bacon (some guests couldn't eat pork) and used 3lbs ground beef, I used a full bottle of Rickards Red beer, used only 2 cans red kidney beans, and I omitted the chili peppers. I had 2 separate people tell me it tasted like Wendy's chili. lol

I actually changed some things. Im a man who loves spice, and meat!!! So i used a pound of cooked bacon and also added chopped ststeak. I also substitued the chopped celery and stuff for the canned mix of celery, peppers and the lot.. I also substituted the peppers for one ghost chilli pepper seeded and chopped. I cooked in the crock pot for 8 hrs on low. The longer you cook the spicier it gets ! Amazing recrecipe! Handed it out to multiple guys at work who loved it!

Everybody raves about "my" chili. I kick it up a notch by adding 3 chopped Serrano peppers. I also use chunks of steak. It's the best recipe I've ever had.

Fabulous!  I like the fact that many of the ingredients are from a can.  If I keep fresh items at the house, most of them go bad before I use them! Very good flavor,a little different.  Really, really enjoyed this meal!  Will make again

Best chili I've ever had. Some recipes on this website call for chili seasoning from a package. Why would I do that when I could just follow the directions on a generic chili package. This chili is very flavorful my only variation is I used 5-6 serrano peppers instead of chili peppers and 3 pretty large jalepenos in my chili and only used the spicy chili beans without straining them. Also omitted beer and went with Crown Royal and a little water in the chili and in my belly.

Very delicious chili! I made a few changes. Used 3 pounds of beef stew meat, 3 cans chili beans, left out the green bell pepper (don't like them) increased the beer to 1 cup, used 2 cans Italian diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel, 1 chopped jalapeño pepper, increased the bacon to 3 tablespoons, and added a can of corn. I kept all the seasonings the same. We're eating this for dinner tomorrow but I had to sneak a couple of bites before putting it into the fridge! Yum! Thank you for the recipe!

I love this recipe but have modified it to my liking I use 2 lbs hot Italian sausage and about 3 lbs of ground beef and I take out the Jalapeno peppers in Canada we can not get spicy red kidney beans so the Italian sausage makes up for it oh and I never measure if it looks like enough in it goes!!

Awesome chili! Have made this 3 times now, and everyone has loved it. My wife was never very excited when I made chili, but now she actually requests it. She does not like spicy stuff, so I was worried it might be too hot for her, but even following the recipe to the T it is not too spicy. So glad to have this recipe in my arsenal!

I made this over the weekend, and followed the directions and it turned out great!  Everybody loved it, I thought we would have some leftover for the week, but it was gone by Sunday.  I didn't add any italian sausage or bacon bits though, which I'm sure would have made it even better, but it didn't need them.  Love this recipe, it will be my go to recipe from now on.

This is the best chili I've ever had. Makes alot. I cut servings to 8 and that way could fit it into my slow cooker and cooked 4 hours low. My family raved about this. I've made this at least 5 times. One time I didn't have bacon bits so I just used bacon grease that I keep in the fridge.  Didn't notice any difference. Definitely tastes better the next day.  You can make it mild or hot. We like it spicy. Definitely a keeper.

Lots of ingredients to chop and add, but it's delicious every time. Seems to be a nice contrast of sweet and heat. I haven't wanted to change a thing any time I make this.

I absolutely loved it! My children loved it! I didn't add the beer and I left the hot peppers out because of my children. It still has the hotness but it's not overwhelming. This was my first time making chilli and I will be using this recipe again.

This recipe is excellent as is, and is likely to require very little customization. Maybe adding a veggie, maybe a bit more spice, but is far superior to most other chili recipes on this site.

This is excellent (spicy) chili!  I had to make a few changes, due to dietary needs.  I used no green prpper, no green chilis and no beer.  And it was still fabulous!  If I was making this for myself, I'd have used everything but the kitchen curtains, but sometimes we are forced to be considerate of our fellow human beings.  Thanks for posting MIGHTYPURDUE22!

This is awesome chili.  My extended family always are asking me to make this.  They are mostly IU fans, not my family all full Boilers, but they love this.  I dont drink beer so I use a 1/2 liter of coke.

The best chili I ever made and I was out of cumin. Warning, it is a little spicy. I did take a couple of suggestions and left out the celery, used 1 cup of beer, and I used 3 mild cans of chili beans and 1 spicy. I used a mixture of kidney and pinto beans, the recipe didn't specify.

This is AWESOME chili ...I just made it tonight.  I used stew meat instead of ground beef and went a little lighter on the ingredients that add the "Heat"but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out FABULOUS!  Hubby and guests loved it too!

Wow! I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was great. I did what other people suggested by making it the day before. I did not change anything other then leaving out the tabasco, as I was unsure how spicy this was. Turns out I could have added it and it would have been fine. Really, Really Good.

Best chili recipe I've found yet!  Family loved it! Very flavorful, thick and had a kick to it! Here's what I did differently: I cooked the Italian spicy sausage on the stovetop, drained the grease from it then threw that and everything else in a crockpot, cooked on low  overnight. Left out the bouillon cubes after seeing it's almost 900mg of salt per cube! Still tasted VERY, VERY GOOD! Added a full can of beer instead of a 1/2, used stew meat pieces instead of ground beef chuck, cut up 1 and 1/2 green cayenne peppers instead of 2 and didn't add the hot sauce for fear it would be too hot, but might have been fine.  It turned out spicy, but not overly spicy so that you couldn't taste the flavors, it was the perfect amount of spice in my opinion.
( On a side note, wear GLOVES when handling the cayenne peppers! No joke, I didn't know you could burn your hands, found out the hard way, the rest of the night I was GOOGLING how to stop my hands from burning, it was awful, soaked my hands in everything and nothing stopped the burning.)It filled my large crockpot to the top, had lots of leftovers which was still very good reheated the next day.

This chili was excellent.  I halved the recipe for two people, and toned down the amount of chili.  I think the half of a jalapeno was just the right amount of heat.

Made the recipe as is except for adding a dollop of sour cream on top before serving.  This was an easy recipe to follow and my first time making chili "from scratch".  My husband thought it was delicious as well!  I will definitely make this again!

Loved this chili!  I just made it for tomorrow's superbowl game. Tried it today to make sure it turned out OK for tomorrow and it was wonderful!  I didn't have any beer so I used gingerale.  I also put sour cream on top with the shredded cheese.  I don't normally like chili but I will definitely make this again!

I just made this chili for the second time. The first time was 1 month ago and I followed the recipe exactly. It was great! And everyone loved it.
 Tonight I'm bringing the HEAT.  4 Jalepenos, 4 Thai chili peppers and a can of Rotel tomatoes. I also used chili meat instead of normal ground beef, it should give a little more texture. It's simmering now. I hope I didn't mess up a good thing.

Barely got it all mixed together in the pot and the flavor is already amazing. 2 hours later and the whole family gobbles it up before I can even sit down. Better than any other chili I've had before...except for Mom's of course.

Daunting ingredient list but not too much prep time. Followed mostly as stated, added some other spices, used beef stock vs bouillon. Touch too salty but could be my fault. Will try again. Thanks to OP and others for contributing!

This recipe is great! I love that the heat sneaks up on you. I changed just a few things. I added a pound of Italian sweet sausage in addition to the two pounds of beef. Instead of red bell pepper I used roasted red peppers out of the jar. I used a can of diced green chilies instead of fresh. I used 2 (15oz.) cans Rotel and one 28oz. can of diced tomatoes. I fried my own bacon and used probably 2 tablespoons chopped. I sautéed all the vegetables in bacon fat before throwing them in the pot. I didn't measure the amount of salt I used but it was more than called for in the recipe. I salted as I went along.

Great chili! The only alteration I made was I really spiced it up by adding a few habanero peppers, extra jalapenos and cayenne pepper.  The ingredient list doesn't show jalapenos on it, but it is on the video. The chili peppers can be really spicy or mild depending on which peppers you choose. Although jalapeno's are chili peppers, on the video it showed 1 jalapeno and 2 chili peppers.  It really needs at least 1 jalapeno.  Served it with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, sliced green onions and Frito's.  Big hit!  Thanks for sharing.

I took this chili to a reception last night and it was a HIT! I used a bottle of Oatmeal Stout beer (too early in the day to drink the rest if it, so I just used the whole bottle!), 1 pound of ground chuck & 3 pounds of cubed pork tenderloin, because that's what I had on hand. The recipe was neither too salty or too spicy -it wag just right for our family & friends.  Thanks for a new go-to chili recipe!

Hands down the best chili ever. I like to add chunks of stew meat for a little something extra!! Especially because my family is split, some like more beans, some like more meat. Gives the perfect balance of both!

Amazing recipe! Perfect level of spicy! I did change cans of diced tomatoes to freshly cut diced tomatoes and added a few jalepenos to satisfy the hubby! Loved the idea of using Fritos instead of plain old saltines!

Dynamic, flavorful chili! Spicy without the "burn your lips off" factor. I simplified a little by getting pre-diced celery, onion and tri-colored bell mix from my market. I also used a 28 oz. Can of Ro-tel diced tomatoes with green chili (Mild) and two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro. I also used only 1 can of mild chili beans and 1 can spicy chili beans (because we tend to like meaty instead of beany chili). Following the advice of others,  I cooked 5 strips of bacon until crispy, then cooked veggies in that. Transferred them to a bowl while I browned the ground beef and sausage. Then I mixed the crumbled bacon, veggies and meat together in my crock pot.  I cooked it on low for 2:30 hours, then let it rest until cool, refrigerates until morning, then cooked on low in crock pot for 4 more hours....wow and yum! DH says it's perfect. Will be using for a chili "cook off" party next week, for sure!

I have made this chile 3 times and am more impressed with it  after I create new batches. The one I made today included a few habanero peppers, 2 without seeds and 1 with seeds. I saw some reviews that referred to this recipe as a vegetable soup type chile but for me, all of the peppers and onions pretty much dissolved into the chile after cooking it in a crockpot on low heat for 8 hours. Whether or not this was the intention of the recipe, it turns out to be a great chile when all of the flavors meld together! I left out  the celery, subbed steak for sausage, used 1 can of chile & 1 can of red kidney chile beans, and used a full can of beer. Other than that, everything was pretty much true to the recipe. I really haven't tried other chile recipes as this one is sooooo good! Yeah, it's a lot of ingredients but adds to the fun of cooking and doesn't add that much prep time.  I strongly recommend that you try this and tweak the recipe to your desire.

I was curious if this chili can really be that good even with all the reviews and 5 stars.  I made no changes at all. Let it sit for a few hours and it is Delicious!  This is one recipe we will continue to use and pass on to friends.

Delicious! I didn't add any salt, and I used liquid beef broth instead of bouillon cubes. Crushed tomatoes instead of diced, because that's what I had on hand. This is the best chili I've ever made. Family and friends said I'm ready for a chili cook off.

Everyone enjoyed it very much. I also roasted the red peppers, and the flavor was fantastic.  Used turkey rather than beef for health reasons, and used an entire bottle of Guinness to give it some huevos.  Excellent recipe.

My "go to" recipe for Chili.  This is the PERFECT recipe to use with a cast iron dutch oven.   I change NOTHING, except to add more heat ( my family loves the heat)  If you are afraid of flavor, then step away from this dish.... If you don't think it has enough flavor, then you have either lost your sense of taste, or you are just afraid to add more.

I use this recipe as my loose blueprint for my chili and it is a hit every time I make it.. I've subbed in spicy sausage, changed out 2 of the cans of beans with pinto/black/kidney(pick 2) and tweeked the seasoning a bit - as well as mixed in various peppers (depending on what I have available).. thanks for sharing, it always reminds me of which direction I need to go..

Arguably the best chili ever!  Followed the recipe with these Texas modifications:

Beans: Only added 1 can of beans.  The one with the sauce.  Texans aren't about that many beans in their chili.
Beer:  An entire tall boy of Lonestar!
Boilermaker:  Since I'm not a Purdue fan, I added 3 ozs of irish whiskey to maintain the boilermaker.

Lonestar Boilermaker Chili!

I made this for the LSU vs Alabama game for 15 people coming over to watch. I changed a little bit of the recipe but it came out perfect. Instead of putting tabasco sauce, I put Pickapepper, instead of pepper, I put lemon pepper. I added my homemade seasoning for an extra kick. And instead of Italian sausage, I put Fresh Deer Sausage. I also added one more onion than needed. I did everything else the way the recipe followed but I added a little water bc I had more people over. It was a huge hit and great reviews.

Absolutely amazing! I cooked the beef and sausage, drained the grease, and then put it in the crock pot with the other ingredients for 8 hrs. It was perfect for dinner that night. Even my picky 10 year old devoured it. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

I made this chili for a birthday party of 10 people.  It turned out so good and received excellent reviews!!  I followed the recipe exactly as is; didn't change anything.  At first, I was very skeptical because once you get everything in the pot, it's very thick (not much liquid).  But the longer it cooked, the more liquidy it became.  When it was time to eat, there was a very nice amount of liquid.  All the ingredients marry together quite well and make a GREAT chili.  Can't praise this recipe enough . . . will definitely make it again!!

Found this recipe by chance... And just won a cook off with it! Everyone loved it and asked for the leftovers! Followed the recipe exactly, except I used real bacon ( 3 pieces which is more than recipe calls for, but who doesn't love extra bacon!) and used Guinness beer since recipe doesn't specify. Also made this the day before so flavors could develop! Yum yum yum, definitely a keeper chili!

Great recipe!  I did follow the advice of some, and used cubed steak instead of ground chuck.  I also adjusted the spice just a little, and I'm glad I did because had it been any spicier my kids wouldn't have been able to eat it.  I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and omitted the beer only because I didn't have any.  I also used a variety of beans; chili, great northern, kidney and black, again, because that's what I had on hand.  I also cooked in my crockpot on low for 8 hours then refrigerated overnight and warmed back up in crockpot for a couple hours the next day.  Overall, a good recipe.  Although, my family could not really tell the difference between this and the recipe I usually make which requires far less ingredients and is less expensive to make.

No cayenne, 1/2 can black beans instead of 1/2 can spicy chili beans, 2 cups beef broth instead of bullion cubes, 3/4 yellow onion and 2 teaspoons dark cocoa powder.  In crock pot on high for 30 minutes then 3 1/2 hours on low.  Serve with chopped onion and shredded cheddar. Cut recipe in half to fit in a crock pot.

Amazing!! Followed directions exactly and heated in crock pot the next day for our neighborhood block party - it was a HUGE success!  The whole pot was finished and I got so many compliments! Definitely making again next year!  Prep time did take a lot longer than stated though - but it was well worth it!!!

I put this on a slow 8-hour crock. Deep notes of chocolate mole, texas smokehouse, and home garden vivacity.

There's good chili and there's great chili    - this rates among the best - you have to try it using roasted hatch chilies - followed all the spices but with only Italian sausage  chunks -the spices were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Prepared this for a Sunday Family dinner, it was a hit with the young and old.  One son does not like sausage so next time I may substitute with beef.  Spice wise even our yougest 4 year old loved the flavor.

I am 58 years young and this is by far the BEST chili I have ever had! I normally don't do spicy very well, so the first time I only used half the cayenne pepper after that I used the full amount.  My whole family LOVES this chili, all seven of my very picky children frequently request it.  Thank you so much for another GREAT recipe.  I love to cook and All Recipes is my go to site, I have found many of my family's favorites right here.

I made this chili for a Christmas dinner at work and it made me famous at the shop. After I refused to give out the recipe a few times, I literally had a co-worker offer me fifty bucks for it, (which I also turned down). I did make a couple small adjustments to this recipe. I left out the can of spicy chili beans and added another can of mild because I was worried about the chili being too spicy. I also used two jalapeno peppers instead of the green chiles, simply because I prefer the flavor of jalapenos.  I was completely blown away by how fantastic this chili is.  I was glad I left out the spicy beans, because it had just absolutely the perfect amount of heat. (It may still be a little too spicy for some, though, so if you don't like spicy, I would leave out the cayenne and hot sauce also). Hands down the best chili I have ever even tasted, let alone made myself. This is my new go to recipe when I want to impress a large crowd.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times. I always cook the onions in a little oil or bacon grease first, then add to that the celery, then the bell peppers, cooking a few minutes between each addition. Then I get the flavors off of the bottom of the pot with about one quarter cup of beer, scrapping the pot with a flat wooden spoon. While doing this, I brown the meat in a separate pan with a little dash of each of the spices. When the meet is brown and the veggies are soft, I drain the meat and add it to the big veggie pot with the beef broth and spices. While that heats up, I add in the other ingredients a little at a time so that the temp in the pot stays up. Sometimes I use a de-seeded jalapeño or two instead of the green chili peppers (cooked with the other veggies at the beginning). Sometimes I use a few pieces of thick bacon crumbled into it. I don't usually use the hot sauce.

Awesome chili that had the perfect mix of texture, taste, and chili feeling. Left out hot sauce and only used half of one jalepeno. should have stuck with the original.

Delicious!  Add or delete whatever ingredients you like or don't like.  I used ground lamb, ground round, and our homemade italian sausage.  Rave reviews!

This was great! I had trouble finding a place with ground italian sausage, and I don't really like sausage anyway so I did without and substituted more ground beef. I also don't like bacon so I didn't bother with the bits. But really best chili I've ever tried. Also used a crock pot instead, browning the meat beforehand. After an hour I was really impressed although I was fairly worried that my 5 quart pot would overflow. (It didn't but barely.)

I left out the beans in spicy sauce and added a pinto and canneli beans. I also left out the cayenne pepper and chili peppers because I didn't want it to be spicy. Also left out the beer because I didn't have any. The chili still came out amazing and the whole pot was gone the same night!!! Great recipe A+++

Love this chili. Make it just as it states minus celery and bacon bits. Makes a lot so I usually halve it if just for a family dinner.

I gotta tell ya, this was just OK.  Bad?  No..  but I will admit I didn't use the ground sausage because I couldn't get it.. just used ground pork..  I think using the sausage would have made a VAST difference so please DO NOT substitute that.  I was worried about how hot it would be, but I found myself adding more spice after it was done because it didn't have a whole lot of kick.. BUT again.. the sausage would have probably helped that.  I will make again and do it with the sausage and then update my review.

Absolutely the best chili ever. I used a habanero to infuse into the flavor, spicy turkey sausage, and extra beans... no bacon necessary (for once)

Best chilli ever! I didn't follow the recipe exactly but it was still excellent. I didn't use the beer just substituted stock. I missed out the basil too. I used three scotch bonnet chillis (2 deseeded) and the heat was perfect for me. I added more bell peppers and garlic. I served with onion rice and cheesey nachos with guacomole and sour cream for cooling. Made a lovely weekend meal and will definitely make again.

Only thing I'd change is to cook the onion beforehand to soften it.  I don't care too much for crunchy onion in cooked dishes, but that is a personal preference.  Otherwise, this recipe is perfect and awesome.  It is very spicy, but we like spicy things.

I have to do five stars because all four of my kids (age 5-14) loved it and went back for seconds!! This makes quite a lot, but all the better for a meal tonight and the second in the freezer--if it lasts that long. I used smoked paprika, and didn't have bacon bits so splashed a bit of liquid smoke. Didn't add spicy ingredients because I'm feeding children. (No cayenne, no spicy sauce chili beans just reg) Very nice! Didn't add sugar, but chopped one Bosc pear and can of corn for sweetness. Yum!

I serve it at my restaurant in Tamarana, Brazil. Mods are: I use the locally grown red saddle beans, which are cooked from scratch. Just add two to three ours of cooking time, in low heat. We use tough and cheaper cuts of beef, but rich in gelatin and flavor, when cooked enough.

Made this last night & the whole family (husband+3children) LOVED it. Served it over Fritos. Only changes made were cutting out cayenne/hot pepper sauce/green chili peppers & used only regular chili beans (didn't want it too spicy) It came out excellent~will be using this from now on?

This was an amazing recipe. I didn't use as much meat as suggested and I used a whole bottle of new castle beer. Came out absolutely perfect. Will definitely make this again.

This is the chili recipe I always use. I've only ever made it with just beef, no other meats, but it's still always delicious. It comes out a bit watery though, so plan to let it simmer for extra time or reduce the number of bell peppers to help out with this problem.

We've made this chili multiple times now and it is amazing. Although I don't feel the bacon bits added much to the flavour of the dish - not likely a necessary part of the recipe.

Have tried a few chili recipes recently and so far this  is one of my favorites. The italian sausage adds something that is nice, and a little different, but in a very good way.

4.5 stars. When people ask me for a good chili recipe, this is the one I refer them to (because they are not getting mine, lol) Very good balance of flavors that come together nicely.

Made it with Founders Porter instead of a lager, pilsner, or stout. We didn't have chili beans in my local grocery store - so we used the following: 2 cans light kidney beans, 1 can pinto beans, 1 can pink beans.  Slow cooked it - 3 hours on high. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS served with french bread for scooping and cheddar cheese and sour cream. Made a (mostly) vegetarian version for the (many) friends I had giving meat up for lent (still added bullion and Worchestershire and a dash of bacon bits, with everyone's approval) that was also really delicious - I posted the recipe as a variation on this one, with suggestions on how to match if the flavor if you want to go full veg. The recipe as is, sans additions like bread, corn chips, sour cream, or cheese has 11 WW points. Reducing the meat to leaner varieties only really saves you a point - however if you try the veggie variation I posted, it has only 8 WW points per serving!

Tomorrow I am going to try it with italian flavored chicken sausage. Can't wait to see how it tastes, and if that goes well will swap out the beef chuck for lean ground beef on the next go round.

This is my go to chili recipe now.  Just enough spice for the grown ups but not too much for the kiddos.  About half the time I make it without the sausage, just because I don't have it around.  I like it either way.  Yummy!

Five stars all the way. This is the best chili I've ever made. I doubled almost everything cause I made a 12qt pot full. Everyone one of my friends loved this chili at a football party. I will be making this chili in the future for sure.

I just made this for a potluck yesterday for a friend's birthday. It was a total hit. There wasn't a drop left and everyone kept telling me it was the best chili they had ever had. Also getting requests to share the recipe. I did not put in the tomato paste, I used a poblano chili, and hot Italian sausage. Definitely a "keeper" recipe!

By FAR, the best Chili I've ever tasted.  ridiculously good and the leftovers taste even better.  I suggest that you make the full recipe because you'll absolutely love it and wish you had leftovers.  The only substitute I made was to use ground turkey instead of chuck to lower the fat content.  When you cook something this long, with so much flavor, you can't tell it's not beef.  I did use the Italian pork sausage but went with about 3/4 lb instead of the full pound, again to lessen the fat content.  Oh, I also omitted the bacon bits.     I used a Dutch oven instead of a large stock pot.   Will make again soon!

Made this for super bowl.  Fantastic!  I used a poblano pepper and an Anaheim pepper in the sauté.   I also used 2 cans chili beans in zesty sauce and 1 can chili beans in mild sauce, all partially drained.   Let it simmer 3 hours the day before then reheated on game day .

I made this recipe as posted. This was a very easy chili to make. I wasn't wowed by the flavor. Seemed just run of the mill chili to me. It wasn't bad at all by any means, just not very memorable.

Won my company chili cook off with this recipe as the base, but made some very important changes. 

Additions while making 2x the recipe:
1. Added 1-2 lbs of cubed steak. Fully browned with garlic powder and black pepper. 
2. Added 1 full pouch of real bacon bits
3. Added 4 Habeneros + 10 small thai chili peppers + 4 serrano (remember this is for 2x the recipe) peppers blended in a blender with some chili broth and added to the pot. 
4. After boiling for 1.5 hrs, transfer all the goodness into a large crock pot (As I transfer every other ladle full has broth since this recipe is too watery with celery and diced tomato juice). Cook on low over night and everything else in the pot goes into tupperwares to freeze. I was actually left with a lot of chili liquid since I like chunky chili and redid the proportion of liquid to meat and beans. The heat will mellow out greatly by noon the next day and turns from front heat (tongue) to back heat (throat). 
5. Serve with cheese, sour cream, and chives with frito scoops on the side. 

Use stought beer like Guiness and serve next day to allow peppers to mellow. My goal is to make chunky style chili and with above changes it is excellent chunky steak chili with decent back heat.

This is really, really good! I had everything but the bacon bits but it didn't matter. I made it in the crockpot the day before and I think it's better the 2 nd day. Only used 2 cans of beans too. All the ingredients may seem like a little too much work/ too expensive but it's so worth it. Best chili I've ever made! Makes a big batch so if you're making it for a small family, you'll be eating leftovers.

Love chili, but don't always have the time to do it right. We found this recipe and love it!  Have a couple friends who say they don't really like chili, but always come back for seconds of this one.

Made twice.SO good but better the first time I made it for some reason.  Left out the bacon bits. Used Dos Equis beer. First time I doubles except for the Cayenne, chile peppers and pepper sauce.  Do not put 4 cups of beef broth, make it too liquidy.

This chili was awesome!  I will definitely make it again.  My husband and 4 year old son loved it too.  I did cut the recipe in half.  I'm glad I did that or there would of been too much for my family of 4.  Also adjusted the heat for the kids.  Loved it!  Its a keeper!

I've read the critical reviews and can only suggest that their disappointment is a matter of comparing apples and oranges. This is the kind of chili I grew up with in Canada ... only better! Hopefully one day I'll make it to Texas and have a chance to try the Texan version of chili!

I have my own style of chili that I've always made, but my partner found this one and insisted on making it instead. 

He uses one less can of beans and cuts out the hot pepper and hot spice. We've served it four New Year's Day parties in a row, and each time the crock pot is scraped down to the last bean. We also made it last year for a family party and the teenaged girls who attended told their grandmother it was so good she had to get it from me!

Excellent base recipe. I made a few modifications, specifically, I used 1.5lbs of ground sirloin beef and 1.5lbs of sage sausage. I also used one can dark red kidney beans, one can light red kidney beans and one can of pinto beans instead of 3 cans of plain chili beans for variety. Regarding the peppers, I used 1 green and 1 red bell, a jalapeno and an Anaheim pepper for a decent amount of heat without aggravating my stomach.

 Other suggestions: make sure that you mince your own fresh garlic. Also, making your own bacon bits from fresh bacon is best. There is no excuse for imitation bacon.

 And, finally, the beer. First off, I am not a big fan of beer in general (I prefer whiskey), but if I'm going to consume beer, I prefer Light Lagers. That said, I used Bud Select in my Chili and the way to do this (regardless of your choice of beer) is to buy a 12 pack. As soon as you get to the kitchen, open your first beer and take two big gulps directly from the bottle (you'll cook off any bacteria), then pour your half-cup. Now, make sure that you have an non-empty, open bottle until you are to the simmering stage. I was on my fourth, but I'm 6'8" and 350lbs; you should have a nice buzz by the end of the recipe.

Best chilli ever, thanks!!! Only thing I did differently was use only mild beans, decreased the amount of beans used, and increased the amount of meat and canned tomatoes. Im not a big bean fan when it comes to chilli but I think I'd still love it if I had followed the directions exactly

Authentic or not this Chili recipe is just plain good.  I've made it half a dozen times now and just see no reason to look elsewhere.   My wife and kids do not like any heat so I forgo the chili peppers and for my own bowl add red pepper flakes and let it sit for a few minutes to add some good spice.

My husband and in-laws love this chili!!! As I was making it my husband was watching in shock...."beer in chili......celery in chili!!!! What are you doing in here. That doesn't go in chili" But when all was said and done he raved about it. I substituted venison mixed with ground beef, added a tiny bit of brown sugar, 1 can of beans less, halfed the spices to tone down the heat, and made it in my crock-pot. However I found this recipe is a little too big to fit in my crock pot. Great flavor! I will definitely make this again!!!!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. We had our first annual family/friend chili cook-off and I won 1st place!! I followed everything exactly as written with the exception of adding about 1/2 a bottle of beer instead of 1/2 a cup. I was afraid it would be way too spicy but it ended up being just right. Even my 11 year old daughter (who hates spicy food) enjoyed it. Thanks again, it was great; and the judges thought so too!!!!

My husband and I attempted this recipe about 3 years ago and have been making it every time we make chili since. At first I thought the ingredient list of all the different spices was a little intimidating but I have it down now and rarely have to look at the recipe. We have modified it slightly for our taste and I make it less spicy and dont use italian sausage. I had more veggies, and sometimes use turkey instead of ground beef. We have been praised many times on how good our chili is, so THANKS for the awesome awesome recipe!!

Decided last minute to try this and I'm so glad I did!  The italian sausage adds such a great flavor.  I made it as written (but halved the recipe)  Served with cornbread.  Will definately make it again.

Awesome recipe!  I adapted to our likes/dislikes and serving size by adding only one can of beans (we prefer a meatier chili), using diced tomatoes with green chiles, increasing the beer to one cup, two beef bullion cubes, a little extra bacon, only 1 lb of beef and 1 lb of sausage and two large cans of green chiles.  Didn't add the hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, green bell pepper or paprika.  But kept all the other spices and ingredients the same serving. Cooked it all over the stove to blend the flavors, then tossed in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low.  Served with corn bread, sour cream and Mexican cheese blend.  This is a keeper! Thanks.

I've tried a few different Chili recipes now, and this is the one I keep coming back to.  I've made it at least 4 or 5 times, and usually stick very close to the recipe as described here.  Excellent, complex flavor, and it just gets better on following days.  Delicious!

I have to admit when I first looked at this recipe I was a little intimidated because of all the ingredients needed. I decided to try it anyway & it was absolutely well worth it. It was the best chili I have ever had. My family loved it & my wife said I better never ask her to make chili again because it was the best she ever had. Apparently it's my signature dish now & I'm the one who can make it for now on. 
FYI: I substituted the ground beef for ground turkey. The regular sugar for Splenda & excluded the beef cubes & Tabasco sauce. It was amazing!!!!!

We Love it! So glad I finally decided to make this! Here is what I did...I didn't have any beer on hand so I used beef broth. Didn't add the celery or hot sauce. I couldn't find the chili beans in spicy sauce, so I just used regular. I added 1 jalapeño instead of the chile peppers. It had the perfect amount of heat for us without using the hot sauce & beans in spicy sauce.  Next time, I will certainly sauté my veggies first to soften them up. After 2 hours simmering there was still a bit of crunch to the peppers & onions. I will never make chili another way...awesome!

I made this exactly as suggested and froze half for another day. My family loved this, but didn't find it overly spicy. In the future, I would probably add more spice and more worcestershire sauce. It was very good though.

Good taste, but overkill on the repetitive spices.  So I simply cut back or cut out what was too much.

Best chill I've ever tried.
Used habanero instead of green chile pepers to add extra kick.

Great base recipe for the spices.  Made it today using NY steak which was on sale and chorizo sausage in place of the chuck and italian sausage.  Omitted the beans and bell peppers as well.  The result was a very tasty chili rivaling any I've tasted at chili cookoffs.  Perfect heat.  Great on rice or spaghetti too!

I really like this but I would omit the celery the next time.  I have never had celery in my chili before and I think it belongs in soup not chili.  I also added an entire bottle of Bud beer, and cut back the chile pepper too because I like my taste buds.

Won a chili cook off with this recipe. I use half spicy and half regular italian sausage. I also use whatever chilis are looking the best at the time (i.e. jalapeño, serrano, or habanero). This is one of those great recipes that is extremely flexible. I always seem to add more bacon bits, chocolate and some of whatever beer is in the fridge. This also makes for a killer topping on hot dogs with cheese. Get organic canned tomatoes for this one.

I followed this recipe exactly as listed. Didn't change one thing, and sadly it was nowhere near award winning chili like some of the other reviews have stated. It was spicy, but had no flavor. Very bland.

This Chili is amazing!  I made it for a Halloween party and it was a big hit.  I was asked for the recipe from several people. I made it the day before in my crockpot. I let it warm through the night and then set my crockpot back to low the next morning.  This was honestly the best chili I have ever made.  Kids and adults loved it!

Best chili ever!! Every time I make it I get rave reviews. Instead of Italian sausage, I use andouille sausage. I'm not a big bean fan, so I just put in 1 can of spicy beans but add in 16 oz of white mushrooms. The mushrooms are awesome in this chili too! It's also delicious if you serve it over macaroni. Cools the heat down a little.

This is the best Chili that my wife and I have ever had.  Having said that, we found it just a bit more spicy than even we might prefer and far more spicy than typical guests might endure.  When I make it the next time, I will half the Chili Powder and Red Pepper.  That should allow us to adjust it upwards to meet our individual taste.  Great recipe!!

I decided I needed to ante up my current version of the chili I usually make. This was a total hit with my husband and his hunting buddies. I now have to make a giant size batch every hunting season for him and his friends. Everyone that I make this for thinks it's the best chili they have ever had. Thanks

I used chorizo and bacon as well as ground beef to put my own spin on it. also used three different kinds of beans , 314 hot sauce and I must say it was phenominal.  Go cardinals!

I modified this receipe a bit by adding ground buffalo instead of beef and spicy Italian sausage.  I left out the tabasco and added a bit more chili powder to taste.  Here's my secret ingredient....a full bottle of dark beer.  Here in the NW we have all sorts to choose from and I have not been wrong yet.  This chili has won me several cookoffs and was also featured in a local grocery store where it took first place.

I love this chili, but to cut back on the sodium a bit I use reduced sodium canned beans rinsed and drained, as well as no salt added tomato products (diced tomatoes, etc.), 2 bouillon cubes, and omit the extra teaspoon of salt as well as the chili beans in sauce. You can also "sneak" in other vegetables, such as zucchini and carrots.

My wife and I have made this recipe at least ten times now and it's always great.  With a few modifications here and there, we've made it to satisfy anyone from the church crowd to our household who love's it hot.  This is one of the best chili recipes I've come across...

My husband is the Chili Master in our house, but when I came across this recipe and saw the rave reviews, I just had to try it. I'll admit, the number of ingredients kinda freaked me out, but it was all stuff I have on hand. THIS CHILI IS THE BOMB!! And it's so, so, so EASY to make. I browned the meat separately and then cooked everything in the crockpot for 10 hours.  SO DARN GOOD ... you will not be disappointed.

First and best chili I've ever made. Rich taste and great flavors. It's definitely worth getting all the ingredients needed. Thought it might be too spicy at first, but turned to be just right. Will cook this recipe again!

pretty good...but i would omit the oregano...serve with nachos, shreded cheese and chopped fresh sweet onion . our gang even likes to add a teaspoon of sour cream on top...i just have all these topping on the counter next to the chili pot...people get addicted to having the 'Taco flavor Nacho and shredded cheese and diced sweet onion on top...:))

Absolutely the best chili I have ever made, and I've made a lot of chili. The heat level is just right and the flavors all blend together perfectly, especially the second day. The only thing I did slightly different from the recipe is that I added the veggies to the drained meat and sauteed for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. Wiped out my spice cabinet but totally worth it! Everyone loved this chili!

Wow, is all I can say about this chili recipe. It was fantastic. I will never make my old chili recipe again even though I thought it was good because this one is so much better. I cooked it on very low for several hours and it was great that night but even better the next day. Thank you for this great recipe.

This is an awesome chili recipe.  Sometimes I make it as is, sometimes I replace 1 lb of ground beef with a smoked chuck roast.  Delish!

although i did not add half of the seasonings(just added garlic and chili seasoning), the idea of adding beer and beef bouillon was great!! i did cheat because i didn't have beef bouillon, all i had was beef stock. When the water level got low i would add some beef stock instead of water. i cooked Italian sausage links separately then cut them up into circles and added near the end(i do not like my ground beef and sausage being mixed and browned together). I also added beef for stew and fried up my own bacon instead of using bacon bits. Great chili. definitely have to add the beer.

This is my first time making chili aside from just using a chili packet and ground beef. It came out great!  The only things I did different was to use low sodium chicken broth since I forgot to buy a can of beer. One of the other reviewers had done that so I figured it would be ok. That and I used real bacon instead of bacon bits. It had just the right amount of kick and a good flavor to it with the sausage and beef.  The only thing I might consider next time is to cut out one can of beans. I like more meat and less beans.

The recipe was very good.  But the ingredient list is so long. It was very time consuming and if you don't have all the ingredients... it can get pricey.

Great Chili. This is now the fourth time we've made this, or a variation on it. Couple things we've tried and enjoyed:

(1) Like others have said, this works great in a crockpot - brown the meat and toss it in with the rest. 
(2) 1 can 11oz, Mexican Corn - love this, plus it adds color.
(3) Usually use more than 1 spicy can of chili beans, and sometimes swap a can of black beans in.

it's a good recipe but we prefer  our version a bit drier, so I carefully add the beer, to keep it from being too soupy.  Also we don't add any salt, cause the canned beans and tomatoes already have salt in them.  I don't add any cayenne, just the chili powder and  and aji amarillo and cascabel peppers from my garden (to taste), giving it more a 'fresh heat'.

So so so good!  I followed some of the top comment suggestions, such as not draining the chili beans and doubling the beer.  I cut out the bacon, fritos, and cheese to cut calories, but the chili stands on its own, and doesn't really need the extras.

Great recipe base with a few tweaks for personal taste and this makes for a spectacular dish over white rice.I have used this recipe for a large family gathering and instead of beer or stout used Gallo red moscato wine, only 1 can of chili with beans as a base, mainly fresh ingredients instead of canned (kidney and black beans). Served over 1/2 cup of white rice with salad spritzed with fresh orange juice. DELICIOUS!!!

Loved the base of this recipe.  We used deer meat and deer jalapeño cheese sausage for the meat.  I used a 7.5 quart Dutch oven and started with 6 pieces of bacon sautéed, set aside, brown the meat and set aside, I sautéed the onions with the garlic then added bell peppers and chills, once that was finished I added the bacon, meat, and the rest of the ingredients, spices, and added a whole can of Guinness beer with 1 cup water.  Then let simmer for 1-1 1/2 hours.  My boyfriend LOVES it and can't wait to make more.

Very delicious!  Of course, I eyeballed some of the ingredients ie more garlic and black pepper.  As a topper, I added a Vermont Hot Habanero Cheddar made by Cabot.  I have found this wonderful HOT cheese in a lot of stores around here and this chili is perfect to add even more heat to (but then I do like it hot so be careful).

I made this recipe for 75, and it was outstanding.  I used equal parts ground chuck, Italian sausage and ground turkey, and reduced the cayenne a little. I didn't have Tabasco sauce, so increased the Worcestershire just a little, and I didn't use bacon bits.

This is the best chili I have ever eaten! More-so, this is the only chili my finicky wife has ever eaten, and she's a plain grilled chicken, white rice, and unseasoned green beans kind of gal. Simply wonderful!  

Here's my changes: I fried 4 pieces of bacon , crumbled them into the pot, and then saved some of the fat to saute the garlic, celery, and onions. I used one can of chili beans, one can of dark kidney beans, and one can of black beans- all drained. I used one can of the Chili beans with medium sauce (think the brand with Duke the dog). I could only find spiced Italian sausage so I chose a mild spice. This is why I didn't use the chili beans in spicy sauce but it was perfect! I was fretting using the 1/4 cup of chili powder but don't fret! It all worked out in the end. FYI, an Anaheim pepper is a chili pepper, and after humming and hawing, I finally figured it out. I followed the remaining recipe exactly recipe with cooking, ingredients, and measurements, and then let it settle overnight in the fridge. WOW! I had it the day of and then the day after, the best got better!

Two tips, get more Frito's and use the biggest pot you have. I have a cast iron dutch oven and that did the trick. I also had a can of pineapple ready for pureeing in case the chili was too spicy but never needed it. It was just enough kick to let you know you had a flavor explosion in your mouth. 

Thanks MIGHTYPURDUE22 for this super recipe!

Hands down WINNER!  I've made many different chili recipes competing in Chili Cook Off's.  This weekend I'm entering with this one, sure to win!  Only modification I've made is adding 1/2 lb more of the ground beef and hot italian sausage for a meatier base and adding 1 tea. of Ghost Pepper sauce, PERFECT level of heat.

A family favorite.  It is worth the effort and expense.  I always get asked for the recipe when I make it.  Chop your veggies fine, let it simmer quite awhile & it'll turn out great.  Very hearty.

AWESOME!!! I made this for the superbowl 2013 party, I used stew meat instead of ground beef and for the beer I used a bottle of Guiness.  I put everything together Sat night and let it simmer for 2 hours.  Sunday I put it back on the stove to simmer all day and we ate around 6pm, also made corn bread with it, delicious, it all got eaten :) even Matt liked it!! Will make again :)

I did follow some small changed based on Nhi Torres review. This recipe is great even if I didn't make the changes. I did: 1) 3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans in mild sauce, NOT drained. 2) 1 (15 oz) can chili beans in medium sauce, 3) 1 small can of chilies peppers, 4) 3 tablespoons of bacon bits, 5) 1 cup of beer 6) Instead of using 2 (28oz) cans of diced tomatoes with juice, I used 3 (14 1/2 oz) can of diced tomatoes and 1 (14 1/2 oz) can of diced tomatoes with basil/oregano/garlic. 7) I like heat so I added some red pepper to it. Yummy and everyone loved it

Great recipe!  Took a while to prep but worth it.  Only modifications were to decrease the tabasco to 1tsp and didn't add the chilis.  Also halved the chili powder but that's only because hubby can't stand the heat!  Made it on Saturday afternoon, cooked for 3 hours, chilled over night and crock-pot-cooked it for 6 hours on Sunday.  From tasting it Saturday night, it definitely improved by Sunday.  Topped with sour cream and cheese - awesome!

I made this chili exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out beautifully. As stated in the description, it can sit on low at a simmer for hours and will only improve. I let mine simmer for three hours, took it off the heat for several hours and then reheated and let it simmer for another 45 minutes before serving. As with any chili recipe, it can be tweaked, but I found it delicious just as it was.

This is my new chili! So yummy! When I made my shopping list I must have looked at a different recipe, so I had a few different ingredients.  I used ranch beans instead of the can of spicy chili beans. Next time, I'll use half the jalapeño, to make it more kid friendly.  Very yummy!

This is an awesome chili recipe.  I entered it in a chili cook-off and it placed 2nd.  I thought honestly, it deserved 1st!  Hardest part is breaking up the sausage and ground beef.  I made it exactly like the recipe calls for.  Spicy, but that's how we like it.

This chili was delicious and super easy; half the ingredients are kitchen staples so there wasn't much to buy. I made it exactly as noted (I don't care to change things before I've tried the original recipe) and don't plan on changing anything in the future. Everyone raved about it and it froze/thawed very well. My only comment is that this recipe makes a TON so if you're cooking for a not-quite-tailgate size group you might want to half it.

I have looked for years for a chili recipe that was a great "traditional" chili.  This is it.  I didn't change a thing and it turns out perfect every time - just the right amount the spice.  The kids even love it.

Wonderful chili, it's way overcomplicated with ingredients....but it all seems to work so I don't touch it.

Also thumbs up to all frat boys trying different beer.....you missed the point and you can't taste the beer.  LOL

I really enjoy this recipe and for the past year has become my go-to recipe. However, I do not use beer and just substitute with either water or chicken stock and it still tastes great. We just don't drink alcohol and use what's on hand. I also use kidney beans versus chili beans. I omit the cayenne to reduce the spiciness of the chili. I always make this chili and it's a hit with everyone. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a go-to Chili recipe!

Best chili ever!  I did not have cayenne pepper.   I substituted a can of green chili peppers for the fresh ones.  I used 93% lean ground beef and 2 1/2 cups organic low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon cubes. I did use the sausage but rinsed it with hot water to get rid of the fat before I put it in the chili.  Great results!  Will make this one again!

Super delicious chili! I made the recipe exactly except for the corn chips. In the future I would, out of preference for mine & my family's health, substitute the ground chuck for extra lean burger or turkey burger in the future, as well as a chicken or turkey sausage. Once it fuses with the other flavors, you'll never miss the real thing, but cut out huge amts of fat & calories. Adding an additional can of black beans would be good too, expecially to mix up the colors a little.

DELICIOUS! Couldn't get any chili peppers so used a long hot, only used half the cheyenne pepper, skipped the hot sauce, and used garlic powder. Hubby doesn't like chili so spicy hot that it burns. This had just the right amount of heat. LOVED it! Thanks for sharing!

Was good but surprisingly the variety of peppers took away from some of the other flavors. I will probably only use one kind of pepper. next time.

We have made this chili over 12 times and not a single failure in the batch. I have rarely had a recipe as fool-proof in my kitchen full of fools. Sure, I tweak it a bit here or there, but the core of the recipe is a solid winner.

Without question the best chili I have ever had. I have made my Mom's awesome chili for the last 25 years ... tonight I just wanted to try something new and different so I  made the "Boilermaker Tailgate Chili" based on the stellar ratings. It is just sooooooo good. Sorry Mom, but I'm going to have to put this one at the top!

My husband loved it but i didn't care for it. It was alot of work and a pretty pricey meal if you don't have everything already, in my case i didn't. I used a regular chuck roast cut up, and the meat was great with the flavor but if i didn't get meat with the bite it really justs tastes like chilli powder. I won't make this again, but it was definately worth trying. I thought this recipe had too much going on that it ruined the flavor. If your going to try this alter it to your taste.

I cook all the time and make a lot of recipes off of this website and several others. Out of everything I have made and all the recipes I have tried this one stands out very well on its own. This chili is by far one of the best recipes I have made on here. I did make a few modifications but they were so minor that they are irrelevant. I usually have to nearly change the entire recepie on these websites to get the right taste. This one is a winner on its own. I used water instead of beer, pablano peppers instead of chili peppers, and added a tablespoon of habanero sauce. The flavor of this recipe is superb!

This has a first bite taste reaction of spicy/hot and as you go on eating you say yes this is good.  Had for Halloween dinner with the corn chips.  This will not be my every time to make chili but glad I made it and will make again.

Fantastic recipe!  Entered this recipe in a chili cookoff at my office with 10 others and won! Followed exact as the recipe calls for  with one tweak.  I added about 1 cup of Crown Royal (Maple finish) whiskey to the finished product as was taking it off the heat, refridgerated overnight, and was fantastic the next day!

My son made this for our weekly football game day get together and it was fabulous.  He might have used a little less on the cayenne because my stomach can't take stuff too hot/spicy.  I couldn't stop eating it even after I was stuffed to the max.

Great chili for someone new to making chili. Chili from scratch is a bit of a process to get all those layers of flavor in there. I made it once as is and then I edited it a bit the second time-- left out the sugar and beef bouillon, but added semi sweet choc chips, a whole zucchini, 2 tbs of roasted dark chili powder, and a 1/4 cup of cornmeal to thicken things a bit. I also doubled the garlic!

Excellant!! I love this chili. The only modification I made was omitt the sausage, since my grocery store does not supply it. But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing. And my boyfriend loved it too, and it takes a lot to please him :) I will definitely make this again!! Thanks for sharing!

I have tried for a long time to make my chili recipe into one closer to what my hubby remembers eating as a child, and always failed.  He thought what was needed was for it to simmer all day, which I did, but to no avail. When I made this one, and did simmer it all day because I cooked it so early in the day, he raved about it. He actually loved it! Only minus the beer: I was going to sub a mixture of juice and Sprite and chicken broth, but left it on the counter accidentally. Still excellent in the family's eyes and soupy enough like everyone likes.

Super Yummy Delicious. I don't think it's too spicy at all.
I omitted the tabasco, and used only one chili pepper. I added extra green and red peppers.
I also added 1/2 cup of water, when it cooks for 2 hours and is left to stand, the consistency ends up perfect!

What made mine extra good:
using hot italian sausage
one teaspoon of red chili paste
one teaspoon spicy brown mustard
one teaspoon of CLOVES!!! The cloves addition is superb.

What I recommend doing is first brown the meat in sautee pan or wok, save half of the grease, in the soup pot that you will be making the chili, warm the grease from the meat, sautee the onions and garlic for 3 minutes, then add the veggies and worcestershire and a bit of olive oil, sautee all together for 5 minutes or so. Then add the beer, water, and all of the other ingredients (spices last).

I've made it twice now, and this time forgot to add the sugar and bacon bits. (The first time I fried bacon and crumbled it in). I can barely taste the difference.

I serve over elbow noodles with lots of sharp cheddar on top and extra fritos on the side!

I used this recipe to win a chili cookoff two weeks ago. I cooked it the night before the competition and warmed it up in a crock pot for the competition. There were 35 judges doing a blind test with several categories. I won the best chili and the hotest after taste category along with placing very high in the other 5 categories such as appearance and presentation. In order to put a Texas spin on it, I used Shiner Bock beer from Shiner, Texas.....sorry Purdue. I also used "Hot" Italian sausage. I will definately be using this recipe again.

I love love LOVE this chili. I found it absolutely ridiculous spicey though as written. My modifications are to omit the sausage and the chilies. Instead I add 1/2 a jalapeno and 2 tsp of red chili flakes. I have young kids who are quite tolerant of some spice so this is just enough for them.

This is the best chili I've ever had. I made a few changes. I used andouille sausage and only added one can of diced tomatoes and an extra 1/4 cup of beer. I left out the green pepper and used a single chili pepper. I served it with frito scoops, sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese and green onions. It was incredible!

The best chili recipe ever. Every year I have a chili party for 30-40  clients, and I tried this one for this year's blast. I had crushed tomatoes and pureed tomatoes on hand and did a half and half in lieu of chopped and paste. Used green poblanos. Throwing out the old recipes. Also make green pork chili stew for the non-beefers. Serve with honey corn bread pudding and watch out! You won't have any leftovers. Wouldn't change a thing!

I am eating this as we speak. I did change the serving size as I only cooked for myself, or two people at most in case my boyfriend wanted some. So I cut everything by roughly 1/3. As far as the beans go, for the regular chili beans, I put in all "mild" beans, and then for the spicy ones I put in "medium" ones. Then I added a lot of Frank's Red Hot Sauce, more than the recipe called for. I also guesstimated all the seasonings. I did add some frozen corn kernels, which gave it a nice sweet flavor. I had a block of white cheddar and shredded it myself, also served it with some sweet cornbread and sour cream. Delicious!! My rendition  of the recipe has the perfect heat level, and I do love spicy food but sometimes I like to keep it at a comfortable level when I'm about to pig out.

Yum!  My husband even commented on how good this was.  I omitted the celery as I didn't have any, substituted H2O for the beer & used cumin seed rather than ground cumin as I didn't have that either.  Other than those few changes, I followed the recipe exactly & it turned out great!  I always hated making chili because mine never turned out good.  I will now use this recipe when I'm in the mood for chili, thanx!!

This chili is so delicious. I love the added flavor from the beer. I didn't add as many chili peppers as were recommended, because the ones at my store were huge. It just depends on how spicy you like things. My hubby loved it - will definitely make again and again.

Many great flavors, but basil, oregano, & Italian sausage gave it an Italian flair (not what I expect in chili). Next time I will omit oregano and basil and use Mexican sausage. I will then rename it Buckeye tailgate chili!

I thought I had an awesome chili recipe, but this stuff is amazing!!  A lot does go into it, but trust me, it effects the taste cause this is the best chili I've ever tasted, hands down.  I made it in the crock pot, (after cooking the meat of course) and I have one of those big oval crocks, and it was to the top, no room to add another sprig of anything, so just know that this does make a ton!

Loved this recipe. I started it on Saturday night letting it cook on high in crockpot for only 2 hours. I let sit in fridge overnight then Sunday early am, back into crock pot and cooked for over 10 hours on low. I did add extra garlic, bacon and beef. This made for a great day of Sunday football, eat all day dish..

Best chili I've ever made.  Didn't quite realize I'd be making enough to feed an entire football team.  But it's delicious.

This is an awesome recipe! I changed it up a little by removing the cayenne and adding chipotle peppers in adobo instead of the green chile peppers and i used a chipotle hot sauce instead of reg hot sauce and it was great.I also used fresh bacon which i cooked in the pot before adding everything else and it worked well. I have received tons of compliments on this recipe and i am constantly asked to bring it to parties. It is def the best and easiest chili recipe around!

I have made this chili numerous times and I love it. Of course, I have made changes here and there. I leave out the sausage and instead sear a steak, sirloin or ribeye; your choice. I cut it up and put it in along with everything else. I also add jalapenos to my recipe, I use a good quality beer and some red wine, Before I put the veggies in I saute them in bacon fat along with garlic. I also add more variety of beans, kidney, garbanzo, pinto, northern. We love beans at my house! Instead of using just diced tomatoes I use 2 big cans of san marzano whole plum tomatoes. I usually cook my chili atleast twice as long too. Very, very yummy!! everyone raves about my chili and people who aren't veggie lovers like my husband still love it too! Just make sure to sautee those veggies and cook i extra long.

Undeniable chilli!!! Everyone I serve this to says it's the best chilli they've ever had. 

I omit the oregano and basil, not a fan. And I do a tablespoon of all the spices, and a pack of bratwurst instead of Italian sausage. 

We serve it over macaroni and topped w fresh shredded cheddar. So good.

Huge hit at a gathering this weekend. I increased the meats by 25% to make it a little chunkier and used hot italian sausage. Yield seems larger than described.

This chili was awesome.  I made it just like the recipe stated.  It's a little time consuming to make but it is worth every minute.  The fritos and cheese give it a nice additional flavor.  And yes, the longer it cooks the better it is.   Will definitely make this again.

Wow... do not waste your time.  I have had better chili from a can or restaraunt.  This is my first bad review.  Normally I just stalk the recipe and make changes as I see fit, but 5 stars.  This was a bold push for a bad recipe.

This is the best chili we have ever had. I made it without the bacon and celery and used a pound of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage.  This will now be our go-to chili recipe. It does make a ton, and I couldn't fit it in my crockpot. I barely got it into the biggest stew pot I had!  I made it a day ahead and simmered it for hours. Thanks so much!

I'm tasting this early (its still on the stove simmering). The flavors are coming together nicely. The few changes I made are using an entire bottle of Red Stripe beer, adding a bit of horseradish brown mustard, and keeping the juice from he beans. I'm feeding a lot of hungry tattoo artists at a pot luck tonight and I think it will be a hit.

Fantastic chili.  Added a chipotle pepper in adobe  sauce for the smokiness.  I love the heat of this chili -- not too spicy, but with a lingering heat.

everyone loves it. I used real bacon, cooked and chopped, also couldn't find chili beans so I used kidney beans instead and only 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

I planned to serve this chili on Christmas Eve and made it this week to test it out.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I was very disappointed.  It was basically just hot, not much flavor.  I used one jalapeno, seeds removed, but followed the rest of the recipe.

Simply put, awesomeness and  you can add or take away small things such as the beer but it was still great. Ive made this chili twice and each time there were no leftovers in sight.

This is the best chili I have ever eaten.  I used 2 cans of pinto beans and 1 can of kidney beans, instead of the 4 cans of chili beans. I added a cup of water to chili for cooking. I followed the recipe exactly except for that. My husband and I loved it. My daughter said it was too spicy, but we love spicy foods.

Great recipe, I didn't have bacon and I left out the cyanne and instead of beer used beef broth. And I changed the name to Panther Chili. The flavor is fantastic. I wll def make this again. Go Pitt!

We absolutely loved this recipe.  Because we love things hot and spicy, I substituted one of the green chilies with 2 small jalapenos.  This one is a keeper for sure!

Yummy!! Best chili I have ever tasted. Served it to 8 people, some of which are very picky eaters and everyone LOVED it!!
I made a few modifications, no celery, 1 can less beans, beef stock/beer instead of bouillon. But for the most part followed it exactly!  A definite hit!  Will make again, soon!

Great chili! I left out a few ingredients and it turned out delicious according to my tastes. I also used ground sirloin instead of ground chuck because ground sirloin has like no bones in it, and I can't stand crunching on bones when eating ground beef or ground chuck. I served it to my friends and family and they loved it, but I only gave them a little so I can keep eating off of it for the week. Thanks.

I have made this numerous times and each time it is a complete hit!  Everyone just loves it and I continuously get asked for the recipe.  My kids even request it.  I am making it right now for my husband and his buddies that are coming over tomorrow to watch some football.  It is the perfect cold weather meal!

This chilli was to doe for. I am not and have never been a chilli fan. I dont like beans. My husband wanted chilli, so i gave it a whirl with this recipe. We like spicey so this was the way to go. I put more hot sauce in mine than suggested and more peppers. It was great! It changed my mind about chilli forever!

Outstanding.  I only made a few small changes.  I subbed one can of chili beans for one can of black beans, I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes with basil, and added some red pepper flakes.  Perfect!

Perfectly hot, just enough to ake your nose run, but no so hot you can't enjoy it.  Add some corn bread, and we were not getting off couch watching football.

Made this with leftover steak/filet that had to be used up and it rocked.  Very easy to put together.  Used a seasonal beer and the guys were raving about it.  Don't be afraid to put your own personal touches in the dish.

Best chili ever!! I didn't have Italian sausage but I had some leftover taco meat and chorizo so into the pool they went. I tripled the recipe and it was gone in 2 days. This is my go to chili recipe from now on. Thanks Purdue!

Made this chili for my husband's chili cook-off at work.  He won first place.  I had almost 3 pounds of ground beef chuck and didn't have room in the crock pot for the second 28 ounce can diced tomatoes.  Used real bacon and broth instead of beer.  Delicious chili - will be our go-to chili from now on.

This is hands-down the best chili I’ve ever eaten.  I made a big batch to freeze for a party, and I’m not sure it will last until then.  My grocery doesn’t carry chili beans, so I substituted canned kidney and pinto beans.  I also added half of a chili-chocolate bar, and a few drops of “Devil’s Blood” chili sauce, because I like the heat.  Stop searching for chili recipes, this is THE ONE.

I LOVE this chili!!  It is hands-down the best chili I have ever eaten.  I can't say enough about it.  The italian sausage adds a dimension that most chili's don't have.  It's a bit of work but well worth the time spent.

Absolutely delicious!!  Try substituting stew meat chunks for the ground beef.  It makes a hearty chili.

I've made several different chili recipes.
My husband loved this one and wants me to make this one from now on.  It made a big batch and it was gone fast.  My Son loved it too.

awesome chili. used ground turkey and turkey sausage to make it a little healthier. we halved the recipe and used 1 can each of normal and hot chili beans - and no chili powder. simmered for 2 hours, then on high to boil off the liquid and make it thicker. topped with sour cream as well as corn chips/cheese. so good! especially with the corn bread recipe on this site!

Fabulous chili. My small alterations were halving the recipe, which fit perfectly in my crock pot. I used real bacon, and a whole bottle of dark beer. Small changes, so I am sure it was pretty close to the original recipe, and WOW. I wanted to make more the next week...maybe I will!

so so so good!  i actually followed the recipe pretty exactly.  used 4 cans of "medium" chili beans with the sauce.  didn't bother purchasing bacon bits.  used an extra teaspoon or two of cumin.  cooked 7 hours.  & absolutely loved it!

My husband is a huge chili fan but was not a fan of my "packet" style chili before.  I made this exactly as directed, only I didn't have any celery and shorted half the diced tomatoes.  He LOVED it, and so did I am our eight year old.  Definitely will add this to the staple.

Awesome.  A genuine "keeper".  One the best (if not THE best) chili recipes I've ever used.  Very versatile recipe.  Will have to try it with smoked beef next time.  Thanks for sharing, "MightyPurdue22".

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  I cut back a bit on the beer, as I'm not a beer fan and can taste it over everything else.  I still add it, just not as much.  I also mix up the types of beans I use.

Excellent!!  I left of the green chile peppers because I don't like a lot of spice.  I used one 28 oz can of plain diced tomatoes, one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with chilis, and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano.  I will definitely be making it again!

I have made this chili about 10 times and served it to about 30 different people.  Around 15 of the people said it was the best chili they ever had and I have had no one say it was not good.  The only things I changed were I added an exotic mushroom blend, more beer and substituted half of one serrano pepper, (thinly sliced), in place of the chile peppers because I like a little more heat.  Thank you soooo much MightyPurdue for sharing this awesome recipe.

Like this recipe needs one more review... :)  Excellent!  I made it the day we ate it and it was wonderful.  It made a ton...  I might use ground turkey next time in place of the ground beef to cut back on the fat.  Didn't change a thing this time.

Great recipe! I've had the sausage based chili at Bob Evans and was looking for something similar, but this is MUCH better. Nice mix of flavors and tons of fresh peppers, and can be spiced up a notch very easily.

Best chili I've ever eaten!  I didn't have all ingredients so skipped the sausage and used ground turkey, kidney rather than chili beans, 3 cans diced tomatoes, no paste, no bouilon, can of beer, chipolte hot sauce, added jalepenos, sweet onion, no bacon or celery. can of fiesta corn and juice of a whole lime.  cut veggies into strips then used a food processor to slice.  turned out larger than chopped but hearty - and way easier than chopping it all!

Absolutely loved it!  Topped it with some sour cream, shredded cheese and scallions right before serving and it was awesome.  Oh btw, my family didn't think it was too spicy at all.  Just right!

My family/friends loved this chili. Im keeping this recipe.  The only changes I made were adding a can of baked beans and a can of tomato sauce.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the taste is sensational....but it's not chili in my opinion. It's a spicy stew. Being a native Texan, I can't wrap my mind around a chili recipe with bell peppers, celery and bacon bits.  I was skeptical but wanted to make it according to the recipe the first time. Next time I will leave these ingredients out and try to find a way to make it thicker as it was a little soupy for me.

I had to make a few changes with the tomatoes, but otherwise, this came out really well. Probably any chili would get rave reviews served with Fritos in this house, though, since normally I don't do that. :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this, minus the hot peppers due to daughter not liking the heat, this was delish! We topped it with cilantro, tabasco and sour cream.

Update: 

Second time making this and I made several changes. I browned 1 lb ground turkey instead of chuck and 1 lb petite sirloin diced instead of sausage in 1 tbl oil. Then I added the recipes seasonings including 1 tsp each anise and fennel seed and 1 tbl steak seasoning. I then added half a bottle of beer and cooked it down while deglazing the pan. Then I added all chopped vegetables including 1 cup diced butternut squash for color. I also added a 15 oz can of pinto beans and 2 cans of kidney beans/drained and rinsed. I omitted one of the cans of tomatoes and instead used just 1-29 oz can of crushed tomatoes with basil (I don't like tomato chunks in my chili). I also added 1/4 cup smoky bbq sauce. My changes made this recipe very different which is why I like the boilermaker recipe so much. You can make it your own with adaptations to your liking. This turned out to be  a great pot of chili.

Great recipe, it does take a little time to chop and prep everything but worth it. I add extra celery, peppers, and an entire package of chopped bacon and everyone loves it. I always freeze half for a quick dinner, and it's great to make taco salads with. A little spicy for the kids but a little sour cream and extra diced tomatoes on top help.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now using ground alligator meat and it never fails to impress. I don't add celery or bacon bits out of personal preference, otherwise I follow to a T and make it for the start of every NFL season. This recipe makes quite a lot but somehow it's never enough, everybody wants some! Love it with sour cream and cheese on top as well as with tortilla chips. Thanks so much for posting a fantastic recipe!

This recipe was excellent! I made it for my boyfriend and his friends, all of whom are navy sailors with hearty good ol' boy appetites, and they devoured it and had second and third helpings. I did make a couple changes though. I added a bit more beer than was called for, made the amount of sausage equal to that of the beef, omitted the celery, and used only the green bell pepper because the red at the time was pricey. 
This recipe really hit the spot and is definitely a keeper  :)

This chili is fantastic, and not difficult to make. I toned it down a bit by using 1/2 of the tabasco, cayenne & only 1 chile pepper and it was still extremely flavorful.  I cooked it for about 4 hours in the crock pot then split it up to make 1/2 of it vegetarian & 1/2 meat lovers.  Both were great, and leftovers were even better!

Everyone LOVED this! Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it was a little too meat heavy for me. But like I said, my family & neighbors loved it. If I was just going to make it for my family, I would sub. turkey or chicken for a little health. Also, added more red chili peppers and garnished w/ avocado slices & fresh chopped jalapenos too- it was great.

The only bad thing about this chili is the name (For a Fighting Irish fan anyways)! Other than that, this chili is pretty amazing. It is easily tweaked to your taste! It was delicious! I will be making it again soon!

This was fantastic. I entered it in a chili cook off and came out with a blue ribbon. You have to try. It seems a little scary looking at all the ingredients but you basically just dump and the long cooking does the rest

I was really fired up to give this chili a try based on  the outstanding reviews, followed the recipe pretty much word for word with a minor adjustment, and was sadly disappointed. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't outstanding either as I've definitely had better. Even the leftovers went untouched. I think I'll let this one go and stick with our original.

This chili was excellent!  I'm not much of a cook, but I'm trying new things, and I was really craving chili with the cooler weather.  Normally, I'd drive to Wendy's and pick up a bowl of theirs, but I really wanted to try cooking my own.  Despite there being a lot of ingredients and quite a bit of prep work, this chili was well worth it!  My boyfriend loved it and said it got better by the day.  All of the ingredients were rather expensive, but the chili fed us for almost a week, so it worked out in the end!  I will definitely save this recipe and use it again!

Way delicious! Won me a chili cook-off! Only real change I made was using canned green chilis instead of fresh. The saltiness provided by the bouillon was spot-on.

A great basic chili that can feed a crowd, suits most northern Maine tastes (read 'not too spicy'), and freezes well.  Made it once so far with great success, will definitely revisit this.  The Italian sausage definitely adds a nice dimension.  The only thing it's missing is the wow factor to keep it from being 5 stars.  I'm not sure what to change to give it that wow factor, but I'm going to keep looking for it.  I'd love to hear anyone's suggestions.

Absoutely wonderful! Lots of flavor! I did not have some of the peppers so I improvised with jalepenos only, but did add some hot chili sauce. I also took out the bell peppers as we are not fans. Overall this was amazing the first night and the leftovers were even better after marinating! Makes quite alot, but totally worth it!

Wonderful chili and worth the prep time (read: 30 minutes of chopping/dicing!).  This recipe is really flexible - for instance I shopped for the ingredients at WalMart and couldn't find a can of chili beans in spicy sauce, so instead I just got 4 cans of chili beans in regular sauce and bought 2 cans of diced tomatoes *ready for chili* (what it said on the label - it had extra diced chili peppers, etc.).  I also didn't have beef bouillon cubes and used chicken cubes instead and you couldn't tell.  The great thing about this chili was that it manages to capture BOTH a great, full flavor PLUS a nice afterburn.  So many chilis are just HOT with no good flavor or flavorful with no spiciness.  This is a win and will be in our weekend rotation all football season.

Delicious. Make often and sometimes tweak ingredients due to the fact that we live in dubai and some things are not always readily available, but always wonderful turn out and leaves no leftovers. I make and freeze portions when I go out of town for the summer and husband always eats it up.

Added some cocoa powder and used an entire bottle of Guiness.  No tomato paste either.  Then just let it cook down.  Didn't have sausage or bacon bits so I left those out.

Excellent chili, full of flavor. My only complaint is all of the canned ingredients, it does make it faster to cook but someone diminishes the finished product.

I have made many versions of this. Tonights variation was smaller and simpler and delicious. I used 1 lb of ground chuck, 1 can of black beans, 1 can kidney beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 diced onion, 2 cubes of beef bouillion, 2 cans of water, same amounts of spices as listed. I omitted beer, Worchester sauce, bacon bits, and the rest.  YUMMY!!

This is by a long-shot my FAVORITE recipe I have ever gotten from Allrecipes.com. I brown the meat and throw everything into my crock pot and come home to Heaven. This recipes makes so much I usually freeze smaller portions of leftovers, or else bless my friends and family with pre-made dinners. Everyone loves this. I will never use another chili recipe. This is it!

So delicious. I had an extra 1/2 lb. of beef so I added 1 can of pinto beans, 1 can of kidney beans, 4 cloves garlic, 2 onions and 1 can of tomatoes and I simmered it for maybe 6 hours. Man was it good. I froze half for future leftovers but had the rest with Fritos on top (on the bottom and they get soggy). The cheese is entirely unnecessary with this chili (about the only time in my life where I would say that).

Update: I have made it a few more times and it keeps getting better. 

I usually add one extra can of pinto and one of kidney beans. I crumble in 3-4 slices of crisp thick bacon and saute the onions, peppers, 3 jalapenos (with seeds/veins), and 1/2 of celery in the drippings of the bacon and sausage. I don't drain any of the cans. I also use 12 oz. of Mexican beer and 4 large cloves of garlic. This last time I used only 2 beef bullion cubes and 1/2-3/4 tsp. of liquid smoke and it was the best one yet. 

Let it simmer for 6-8 hours and the flavors will really come through.

This was the BEST chili I have ever made or eaten anywhere ever..in my whole life & I'm 40!! ...I tweaked the recipe a little to fit my family.  Started off with 1/2 lb chopped bacon & cooked til crisp. Remove from pan & add 2 lbs. beef stew meat.  Brown in hot bacon fat.  Remove stew meat from pan ..add sausage & brown.  Then add all meats back into pot & follow recipe exactly from there except omit bacon bits (obviously) ...and because of my little ones I also omit the chile peppers.   I have also made this recipe following directions exactly & was also FANTASTIC!!  ...but very spicy hot!  ..DO NOT forget the Fritos!   ..stew meat makes it HEARTY!

Good.  I omitted the bacon.  It is a lot of work, and I think my family still prefers our chili soup (thinner-made with tomato juice and has noodles).

I made this chili tonight and it was fantastic!! The only changes I made were to reduce the amount of meat - I used 1 lb of ground beef, 2 Spolumbo's mild Italian sausages and no bacon bits. Since kids don't appreciate this much heat, I would reduce the cayenne pepper next time, omit the Tabasco (Tabasco or chili oil can be added at the table by those who like it how) and use just one or no green chili peppers. We had it with nacho chips and grated cheddar cheese. Sour cream on top would be great too - especially if you have little ones who need the extra calories. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is one of the best, if not the best, chilis I have ever had. The first time I made this was for a chili cook off my church was having as part of our Halloween carnival. This chili won 1st place and was named "best tasting."   There is plenty of room to work with this recipe.  I used Bratwurst instead of the Italian sausage, 4 tablespoons Au Jus base in place of the beef bouillon cubes, and apple juice in place of the beer.

This chilli turned out really well.  My roommate helped with the chopping which was  little extensive, but expected.  It made quite a bit and weighed in at 19lbs.  Thanks for lots of leftovers.

I have made the chili exact, and also with a few alterations, and either way you go, it is a great fall/winter chili. My husband requests this often, and I am always happy to oblige.  Thank you for the recipe!

Perfection.  I cook mine in the morning on the stove and then put the cooked chili in the oven at 230 F all day.  This temp allows it to simmer for hours.  I usually make sure it is in the oven by 9 am for a 6 pm dinner.  The meat is super tender and the taste is outrageous.  I also only use ground beef (no sausage) and canned red beans (no chili beans).

Delicious :) Made it in my slowcooker(halved the recipe; cooked 8 hours on low), so I had to change two things: I sauteed the veggies to get rid of some of the excess liquid, and I added an extra can of tomato paste to thicken it up further.  I added more garlic, as I always do, and some mushrooms (because I couldn't imagine having chili without it). Other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly and it was amazing!

This was a fantastic chili recipe (though I wouldn't say award winning).  However, this replaced my old chili recipe as my favorite chili.  I halved the recipe because there are only two of us, and I regreted it!

I thought this recipe was exceptionally good.  I was surprised that I actually had ALL of the ingredients except one can of beans, Paprika, and Chile Peppers...      My Modifications:  I used 94% Lean ground beef.  Instead of Italian Sausage I used Smoked Turkey Sausage.  I thought the smokiness of the sausgae added some nice depth.  I also pureed a can of Pineapples like someone else had suggested, this helped cut the heat but didn't make it sweet.  I used 1 can of Kidney beans (drained) and one can of Chile Beans (with sauce).  IMO 3 cans of beans would have been too much. I did not add bacon bits.    My husband loved it and said it had Just the right amount of spiciness.  Enough to feel but not too much that you can't eat it.

I love this chili!!!! I've made it about 6 or 7 times and I follow the recipe as is and I always get rave reviews. Once, I put the chili in bread bowls and that went over really well. The flavor of all the spices is spot on. I can't get enough of this stuff

First time I took this much time to make chili, but it was well worth it.  Hubby took it to work in a crock pot.  Filled to the top, but when he came home, might be just enough for the two of us for dinner.  Everyone loved it!!!  A+ recipe.

This is THE chili recipe at my house now.  It does take awhile to assemble all the many ingredients but it tastes so much better than pouch chili that it is well worth the effort.  I have found it to be a bit salty so instead of 4 cubes of beef bouillon, I use 3.  I also left out the green and red peppers because my husband isn't a bell pepper fan.

I have made this chili 3 times now & my family LOVES it (including my 5 yr old nephew). Me & my nephew are both VERY picky eaters so I thought I would have to make sandwiches too. No, we loved it. Probably the best chili I've ever had. WHAT A  GREAT RECIPE! thanks!

1,516 people cant be wrong!  Very good chili.  I did make a couple of changes for the ingredients I had on hand and I used fresh bacon instead of the bacon bits.  I cut down a bit on the spices to suit our small children but this was delicious!  While it was simmering on the stove, I made 'san francisco sourdough bread' bowls to put the chili in and topped them with some cheddar and toasted them under the broiler!  Very nice!

YUM!  The only change I made was to use ground beef instead of sausage because I have allergies to italian sausage.  Delicious, and not as much work as previous chili recipes.  Spicy, but didnt burn your mouth off, which was a good thing for my norwegian husband :)

People go nuts over this.  Seriously, make it with a side of corn bread and you'll be everyone's favorite host.  A few ideas: -  Definitely let it sit over night if you can.  -  I made it with beef and turkey instead of sausage and it was still awesome.   -  Real bacon cut up small was just as good as the bits.

I made this chili for the first time this past weekend for an event I attended.  It was a hit!  It's a little time consuming, but very easy to make.  It is delicious too!  I love chili and am always looking for a good recipe.  This is definitely one of the best ones I've ever had.  I doubled the recipe.  It makes a LOT of chili.  I brought the rest with me to work today and it was devoured in no time.  For me, it has great texture, and it's spicy, but not ridiculously spicy.  The only thing I changed about the recipe, was that I left the chili peppers out because I just couldn't find any in Alaska right now.  HA!  It's still fantastic.  EAT SOME.

This is chili lovers chili! Yum! I had my doubts..26 ingredients??? The only changes I made were to omit the celery, added a large can of tomato juice and cut the hot pepper sauce and cayenne in half. (You can always add more later but you can't cool it down!) It was still hot but not too hot for us to enjoy. Heat is personal! And adding the tomato juice made less like stew and more like chili.  Go Boilers!

I am always looking for new chili recipes and as a fellow Boilermaker, I had to try this one.  My husband and I loved it!  We did it in the slow cooker and added a little more cayenne and red pepper flakes for spice, but I think it would have been just as good following the recipe as is.  Thank you for posting this, we will definitely have this version of chili again and GO BOILERS!

I'm writing this as I'm licking my bowl clean! I made it almost exactly as written, i just ended up adding extra onions and peppers. I also chopped up about 5 fresh tomatoes and added those as well. I love chunky, thick chili and this was excellent! Since i was making it for a large crowd which included children and people not fond of spicy food, i didn't add any cayenne or hot sauce. Instead i filled and empty salt shaker with cayenne and set it out along with the hot sauce so that people could add it if they wanted. SO GOOD!

I am having some friends over for superbowl and thought this sounded rich and flavorful--and it is!  I did add 1 tblsp Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa powder and about 3/4 cups beer instead of 1/2 cup.  My pot isn't super huge (7 qt dutch oven) so I only have 3 cans of chili beans-1 hot, 2 reg--did not add that last can.  I also removed the meat from the pot after browning the beef and italian sausage.  I then added a tbsp bacon drippings and sauteed the onions in that until they started to soften and then added all the dry spices to toast them a bit.  I think it gives a more aromatic flavor overall.  Hubby is loving it.  I will simmer for a while today and then freeze until Superbowl sunday---should be melded and even fabulous-er by then!

Very good, and reasonably simple to make with ingredients that you have available. I made a big pot and everyone I shared with demanded the recipe!

When I looked at this recipe, it had a lot of the ingredients I used to make my chili, just a lot more of them....so I tried it. OMG!! What an awesome recipe. Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you away. Most of the ingredients are small amts of this and that, but together they make the best chili ever. Whenever I make it now, we invite friends over and they all rave it's the best they've ever had, and we agree. I pass this recipe along to everyone. I have altered it a bit everytime I make it. Now I increase the ground beef to 3 lbs and leave out the sausage. I just put 3 cans of plain kidney beans, drained. I use the red pepper occasionally, but it doesn't make a difference in taste if you just use green peppers. We don't eat it with Fritos, or add cheese....just dip in hot buttered toast. The only way to eat chili!!

This chili is absolutely delicious! It takes a while to put together, but it is so good that it's worth the wait. I promise, after making this chili, you will never want to use chili-o mix again.

I made this for my fiance's family and they all loved it!  I made it a little spicer (I added some ghost chile powder) and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe other than the extra chile and, like I said, it was great!

If I could give this more then 5 stars, I would!!  So easy to make but YUM!!!!!  This has to be the best chili I've ever had...and it came out of my kitchen!  The only thing different, was that I didn't have chili peppers.  My 11 year old thought it was plent spicy enough without so it was probably a good thing.

Holy cow...totally went into this reciped as a skeptic...but very delicious.  I actually tried the chili every 30 minutes as it was cooking...and I thought it had more kick within the first 30 minutes than it did at the end.  Next time, I'll be adding more cayenne and jalepenos to give it a little more kick.

Don't let this long list of ingredients intimidate you!  It is well worth the time -- no comparison to "ready made."  I let mine simmer almost four hours and it was incredible.  I used serrano peppers and pinto beans -- glad to have tried it.

I omitted all the peppers, bacon bits, beer and hot pepper sauce.  I did add one can of ro-tel on top of what tomatoes the recipe calls for.  All my beans were regular kidney beans.  I omitted the pork and used 1 1/2 lbs deer meat and 1 lb of ground beef.  I used chili powder, but only about 1 T. or so.  This was just spicy enough for my family. My husband likes hot and I like mild. This recipe made us both happy.  This is my new chili recipe. Thanks for posting.

Absolutely love it!  I make the worst chili in the world, every time it would come out different and the result was always bad.  I made this for my family and everyone loved it.  Took some to a couple of older folks who live by themselves and they loved it, too.  The only change I made was to use half of the chili powder.  Thank you Thank you Thank you.

Excellent!  We loved it-- thanks for sharing.  I made it on the mild side, (half of chili powder and chili peppers of what was recommended -- I wasn't sure if it would be TOO hot) will add as recipe calls next time I make it.  And there WILL be a next time.  Delicious!

AMAZING recipe!!  I followed it exactly, except for I didn't have bacon bits... so I used 1/2 TB of Liquid Smoke instead.  I simmered the chili for 4 hours, cooled, and then refridgerated.  Each day aftwards the flavor keeps getting more delicous.  I'm going to make more and put in the freezer for a delicous lazy dinner.

This chili was great!!!  I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews.  I don't like anything really spicy so I did modify this a little.  Instead of using 2 green chilis, I just used a few slices just to give it a little kick.  I did not add the hot peper sauce and I cut down on the red peper and paprika.  My family enjoyed it and thought it had good flavor and kick.  All in all it was a big hit.  This recipes feeds a lot.

Love this recipe.  Every time I make it, someone asks for the recipe.  I often make a double size batch, bag and freeze most of it, and reheat as I need it.  Family favorite.

Wow! This Chili is so good I've made it 2x in the last week! The only changes I made were - I add a full can of beer, decreased the chili powder by 1/2 & add fresh mushrooms. This gave it a nice kick that wasn't to overbearing. I will definatley use this chili recipe for now on!

WoW!  This is THE best chili I have ever made or have eaten.  My family totally agreed.  I made a few changes because of our taste.  I used a combo of ground turkey and ground beef and omitted the bacon bits and sausage.  I used the whole 12 oz of beer (guiness) and used only red peppers.  I used canned chilies because I had them on hand adn served it with corn bread.  I will only being making this chili from now on.  THanks so much for such an awesome recipe.

I omitted several ingredients and this still turned out slap-somebody good!!! Can't wait to tast it tomorrow.  I omitted the fresh chilis, bell & red peppers, I used diced roast beef (london broil) and spicy sausages, added a bit of beef broth, half cup of corn, and used 1 can black beans and 2 kidney. I served it over brown rice and topped with sharp cheddar - YUMMO!  The seasonings, beer, boullion cubes, and tomatoes provide a good base, you can use what you have in the pantry and still come out a winner with this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!.

Boiler up! Figures a fellow Boilermaker would know how to make a mean chili. This was the first chili I've ever made and I think I'm spoiled now. I ate it with my typicl round Tostinos and sour cream. It was pretty easy to make. Next time I might try to use fresher ingredients, like fresh tomatoes. Great reheated as well natch!

I used beef chuck steak and cut it into little pieces instead of using ground beef chuck. It came out great!

My husband was a chili hater until I tried this recipe, now it is his all time favorite.  It is spicy (clears the sinuses for sure) but that is how we like it.  Fantastic!

GREAT Chili!!! I cooked it on a crockpot for 20hrs.  I used ground sirloin and also substituted one of the 3 chili cans to Red Kidney beans.  I added an orange pepper, a full pack of real bacon bits, a cup of Sam Adams (Ocktoberfest), and triple the amount of Worcestershire.  As a Michigan fan I think I have to call mine Wolverine Tailgate Chili.

This is my new chili recipe.  I didn't make any changes except I used a whole beer as I don't drink and I didn't want to waste it.  Lol.  So, so good.  Even my husband loved it - which must mean it's good.  Top with Fritos and some sour cream.  So yummy.  Thanks!

This was delicious!  My boyfriend and his friends said it is a keeper as well.  I made a few adjustments according to other reviews.  I used deer meat instead of the Italian sausauge.  I also used a squeeze or two of verde salsa instead of the chile peppers.  It made a huge batch and I will likely shrink the recipe to feed just a few people.  If you are looking for a chili recipe...This is it!

I followed the recipe for the most part.  I had to make it pork-free, so I used Italian-seasoned ground turkey instead of the Italian sausage and omitted the bacon.    It simmered for six hours, and I thought it was delicious...and I'm from Texas!

I think this is bar far the best Chili recipe I have ever had! It has just the right amount of spice not to spicy but just enough to make it WOW! I used 2 cans kidney beans instead of three cans chili beans at my husbands request, and it was still awesome!!

I a not sure what happened but my chili turned out SUPER salty. Could have been my mistake because otherwise it had great flavor but next time I make I will not add any salt and will pay ore attention to the salt content of the other ingredients.

My husband loves chili and I always hated making it because it always came out too thick and didn't have enough flavor.  When I came across this recipe and read the reviews I thought I should try it and I'm glad I did.  This chili is so easy to make and full of great flavor.  I served it for guests and they couldn't get enough.  Thank you for posting such a great and easy recipe.  Usually I don't like to make things with tons of ingredients but this one is worth it.

Yesterday was my first time making Chili and this recipe was exceptionally easy and delicious. I made it for a work fund raiser and the whole pot was gone before I knew it. It wasn't that spicy. I was short a can of chili beans and forgot to buy a red pepper, otherwise followed the recipe.  I will make it again. Update: tried doubling the recipe but it was way too much for my crock put to handle. will have to remember to do just one batch at a time!

OMG!!!!! I am not (let me rephrase that) "was not"  very much into chili at all. This is def the recipe to make if you are looking for a Great Chili! I find myself wanting to make this all the time. The first time I made it I thought it had made a ton and I would have alot left to freeze. Well, lets just say it never made it to the freezer! It was soooooooooo good! I guarantee you will be back up for 2nds, even 3rds!  Thanks so much!

I made this chili for my husbands co-workers (all men) for a lunch-time pot-luck. Needless to say, by 8:45am, my husband called to inform me it was all gone and they were asking for more!! Great recipe!

Just made for the first time and it was excellent! The first day I was worried it was too spicy for some people but by the next day was perfect. Only thing I changed was I used 3 different types of beans. Will definitely make again and again - great recipe!

This chili was delicious.  I used kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans instead of the just the chili beans.  I really liked the taste of the three different beans together.  I also added a little more beer as I like my chili slightly less thick.  The combination of spices was very tasty.  Great recipe!

Can I give it any more stars???  This was absolutely fantastic!   I made exactly as is, except I used one drained can of kidney beans in place of one can of chili beans.  I served with Mexican Cornbread.   I will definitely be making this again and again.

I made this chili for a chili cookoff among friends on October 31, 2009. I searched the internet and came across this one and decided to make it due to the stellar reviews. I wanted to win this cookoff since my friends are such good cooks and thought I might have a chance with this one. Anyway, made the recipe exactly except used 2 cans dark red kidneys and 2 cans hot chili beans. I also used a whole 12oz. beer (Bass Pale Ale) instead of recommended 1/2 cup. This took longer to prep than 30 minutes for me because I fine chopped everything. Anyway, my first sample was incredible. All of the flavors stood out and left me wanting to eat another bite. I browned all the meet and sauteed all the vegetables and then put everything into a crockpot to cook about 4 hours. There were about 10 different chilis at the cookoff. I was very suprised to hear that my chili took first place. I did not tell anyone that I had just grabbed the recipe from the internet that very same day. I figured they didn't need to know that. HAhA. Awesome chili. I am making it again for this weekend.  Cheers

I made this recipe again in 2011 for a neighborhood Chili Cook off competition during Halloween. There were 17 other chili recipes entered and guess who won? Yep, the boilermaker won this one too. I was just amazed. What a great recipe. Only downfall is the prep time but really worth it.

I have never, NEVER tasted a chili so good as this.  I cannot imagine how anyone could give this any less than a five star, barring personal opposition to Boilermakers...I have a chili connosieur for a husband, and this was absolutely DEVOURED by everyone, had to make a second batch just for him.  Amazing recipe.

I made this chili for a cook off at work and it did not place (out of 11 chilis it didn't make it into the top 3). I did get a bunch of compliments on it. It is a good classic chili recipe.

Simply the very best chili I have ever had. I've been using this recipe now for a while and I make it just as it is shown.  It's very impressive and will turn heads at any chili cook off.

Awesome flavor!  I followed some suggestions. I added a full bottle of beer, switched a can of chili beans with a of kidney beans, used brown sugar. I cheated and used a can of chopped green chilies which took down the spice a notch. The major change was I only used 1lb of ground chuck and 2lbs of Jennie-O spicy turkey sausage. We made corn bread muffins instead of the Frito's.
I also sauteed the veggies in the bacon drippings the last time I made it and it changed the over flavor for the  better.

This is very good - spicy but not too hot.  I especially liked how tender the beans and beef were, without breaking down, even after four hours of cooking.  I made half a recipe, and it was plenty for my family of five. UPDATE:  I now add one ounce of unsweetened bakers chocolate.  It adds a rounded flavor.

I thought that this was a great Chili recipe.  I altered slightly to match our tastes (toned down the heat and no green peppers, hubby hates green peppers).  It does make a lot but that is fine with me.  Our family ate about 1/3 and then I froze the remainder.  This freezes great!

This chili was awesome:) We are not big on beef and pork so we used deer instead but kept everything else the same and it was amazing! Perfect seasoning with every bite:)

This is our favorite chili recipe ever.  We generally do a lot of tweaking to recipes we find to make them our own, but this one doesn't need any tweaking!  I don't like beans, and I could eat a whole pot of this!

I scaled this recipe down some but used 1 1b. of ground Turkey and 1 lb. of sausage. I also only added 3 cans of beans- 2 dark red kidney and 1 light red. I also added a little more hot sauce (Franks) since I did not use beans in the chili sauce. Also only used one can of tomatoes. This still made a TON of chili- filled a large crockpot. This recipe was very, very good!

AWESOME!!!  We loved it!  Finally a chili that my husband would not change. I altered the recipe a little.  He is not a fan of tomato-ie chili and doesn't like a thick chili, so here is what I did...  I did not add the tomato paste. I left out the celery.  Instead of the green chili's I just added a can of chopped green chilis.   I added 4 Tablespoons of bacon bits.  I added a whole can of beer.   I added about 2 Tablespoons of chili powder instead of the 1/4 cup. I did not add the hot pepper sauce.  I thought it was a little thick, so I added a 12oz can of tomato juice and 12oz of water.   It was perfect for our family.  Even my son ate it up!

This was incredible. I made it for a chili cookoff I am participating in tomorrow... I am expecting a win!! It seems more difficult that it really was to make. I added a can of butter beans and black beans as well... DELICIOUS!

Excellent! This was the first time I made chili and I followed this recipe (and the suggestions of reviews) and it turned out wonderfully! I also used a crock pot, and I have the standard size crock pot (5 quarts, I think), I would suggest using a larger one.  Maybe a 6 quart, at least.

I made this recipe last night and cooked it in my 7 quart crockpot all night!  It turned out great!  It tastes soooo good!  It is fantastic.  It will make a lot!  So make sure you half the recipe for a smaller crowd or invite some friends over!  Took a while to prepare it but it was certainly worth it!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I read all the other reviews and made a couple of minor changes: I added the whole can of beer, no bacon (didn't have any), 15 oz cans of tomatoes instead of 28 oz and kidney beans instead of chili beans (used what I had). I also added 1 TBS of chipotle chili powder. This was awesome and fresh tasting and our new family recipe.

Terrific recipe!  Had to modify a bit for a contest I was in.  Increased the tomatoes since beans were not allowed... added a little lime juice and adjusted the "heat" at the end with some Sriracha sauce.  Best recipe I have found for chili!

This is sooooooo good!  I had to omit the pepper because my husband doesn't care for it (who doesn't like pepper??!)... but it still tasted wonderful!  We even added mushrooms to it one time.  Definitely a keeper!!

1) forgot the red pepper  2) didn't have cayenne pepper, so i used cajun seasoning and tonys creole... which the hubby actually put in  3) got boullion powder packets by mistake 4) used brown sugar instead of white 5) used a whole can of beer  6) used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of the 3 chili beans  7) store didn't have green chili peppers, so i used 3 red chili peppers  8) used 5 pieces of bacon i cooked and the mister crumbled them in  9) sauteed the onions, celery, and garlic in the bacon fat  10)  he likes it really spicy so i added about a Tbs more of the hot sauce to HIS taste. It's going to sit in the fridge until tomorrow when the hubby man takes it to work!  he tasted it and said it was  good!  bad thing is, im a vegetarian so i couldnt taste my handywork!  ive actually never made chili before! im interested to hear if he thinks it tastes better the next day since the flavors will have a chance to marinade over night!

Really great chili!  I made this for my husband and some of his friends that came over for a UFC fight on TV.  I prepared it just as directed, however I used kilbasa sausage instead of italian sausage. (I forgot to get the italian at the store and had the other on hand).   Man, they said it was the best they had!  I set up a station on the middle of my kitchen island that had a pot of this delish chili, sour cream, fritos, green onion, jalepenos, olives and 2 kind of shredded cheese.  The beer definately makes it!  Dont make it without the beer!!!

I usually just follow the recipe on the back of the can of chili beans, but this chili recipe is FANTASTIC and will be the only recipe I make from now on.  Since I was just making it for my husband and myself, I cut the recipe into a third and only used one lb. of ground beef...I'm sure its even better with the Italian sausage. My husband loved it.  It definitely has kick and I didn't even try to serve it to my kids.  As long as Purdue isn't playing the Hawkeyes, we'll be making this chili on game day in our house!

Very good!  I changed a few things, but stuck pretty good to the recipe and it was delicious.  Too spicy for my smaller kids, but if your kids are used to that kinda thing I would think they would love it.  I'll be using this recipe again with a few of my 'tweaks'. Finally I have a recipe to follow.  I usually just add this-n-that to my chili and it comes out delicious, then I have no idea how to re-create it.  Thanks.

This was pretty good. Made a HUGE batch (did I mention, this makes a TON???) of chili for the recent U of IA vs. Penn St. FB game. Since fall has made its presence here in the "Windy" City, I thought chili would be the the perfect game watching food! My friends liked this, but my fiance didn't (he prefers chili w/o beans; I thought this was so-so...). I did make a few ch. to suit my/our tastes. Here's what I did: a) cooked everything in my sc on low for 4 hr., b) used 1/2 mild & 1/2 spicy sausage & c) subbed 2 cans of tomatoes w/ green chilies for plain ones & fresh peppers. I used a good quality smoked Spanish paprika (purchased at my local spice shop) instead of the generic store brand stuff. My beer of choice was Leinenkugel's red (lager). I must say, leftovers (last night's dinner) were much better (IMHO). The beer taste & a subtle smokiness which was absent in the initial batch came thru nicely. I'd like to try this again, but when I do, I will use real bacon (I used Hormel bacon pcs. this time), & sautee my veggies in the drippings. I will also only make 1/2 since the full amt. yielded WAAAY more than 12 servings (my 5 qt. sc was full to the hilt!). Served w/ cheddar, Frito's, scallions & hard cider, this was very filling. I still prefer 3 Bean Slow Burn Chili (JACOBS40K), but b/c this is milder & more suitable for all palates (i.e. kids, etc.), I'll stick w/ this recipe instead. Tx. MIGHTYPURDUE22 :)

This is one of the best chili recipes I've ever had, and is by far the best I've ever cooked.  I didn't deviate from the recipe, and all the ingredients together create a real complexity of flavor.  Bravo!

This was pretty good. I took the advise of others and cut back on the spiciness- big mistake. it was missing something and i think the extra zip would have made it better.

Thats some good chili!  I subbed the bacon bits for half a pound of chopped cooked bacon, sautee'd the veggies in the bacon drippings, and added 4 minced Jolokia (Ghost)peppers and a can of corn kernels to the mix.  Unreal delicious. THANK YOU

Delicious and hearty chili recipe!  It called for a lot of things I already had on hand, but it was still a little pricey to prepare.  We used ground turkey and it was still scrumptious!  Don't forget that you can adjust ingredients to suit your own taste, it is chili after all.  Also, I think the negative reviews had to be from people who didn't let it cook long enough.  There is a HUGE difference between chili that has cooked for 2 hours, and chili that has been cooked for 6-8 hours.  I used an entire bottle of beer and no beef bullion (bc I didn't have any), skipped the paprika, added a little sriracha, jalapenos, habaneros and honey. WONDERFUL recipe!

I don't like chili - but I LOVE this chili!  I omitted the celery and the chili peppers, and it was still plenty warm.  Serves an army, with leftovers.

This is an excellent Chili recipe. We made it exactly as it says, and we loved it.  This is not your ordinary chili!!  We decided that if you could call a flavor deep, this would have a very deep taste, it's hard to describe, but very very good!

This was hands down the best chili I've ever had! i made a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand. I used three regular cans of chili beans instead of a spicy one and just added extra hot sauce to replace the spice. I also added half a zuchini and some fresh corn from my garden as well as a small garden bell pepper. I didn't use the beef bullion because I didn't have it but I didn't feel it needed it. I used an italian seasoning mixture instead of adding all the herbs individually and it was great! And as a lot of other reviewers did, I added a full bottle of beer (hefeweizen) to give it more flavor. i followed the recipe for everything else. I carmelized my onion before adding it in, and cooked this in the crock pot for about 5 hours prior to dinner time. It was so hearty and satisfying with shredded cheddar and corn chips... I will be making this one often! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I am simmering this chili right now.  I snuck a little bowl about 30 minutes ago and it is sooo tasty.  I did switch up the recipe a little bit..but for the most part have a lot of the same ingredients.  I cannot wait to have another bowl in about 20 minutes.  Thank you.

So good! All the different meat in the recipe makes it the best. Plus all the seasonings melding together really gives it a good flavor. Will keep this as a favorite for sure! Makes a lot.

Absolutely AMAZING. I am not a big chili eater, but this had me hooked! I'm pregnant so I didn't add the beer, but it was still the best chili I've ever tasted in my life. I made the full amount and have 3 tupperware bowls waiting to be eaten in my freezer - glad to always have some on hand to share with friends and family!

This chili was tasty, but I wasn't all that impressed, especially considering the overwhelmingly positive response this recipe has. I did love the spiciness though. Good recipe, but I don't think this chili was for me. *shrug*

My husband and I did this recipe with our own modifications and it was amazing! My husband mainly did the cooking, and after adding a couple more jalepenos and his own hot sauce, renamed it "Dante's Inferno Chili". He was proud of himself. Any chili that is simple enough for a my husband to cook and still come out tasting awesome, is a very good recipe!!

The best chili recipe, hands down.  I just omit the beer: that's it.  I use Tapatillo for the hot sauce and it's glorious.  I usually can't find the spicy chili beans, but I'd use them if I could.  Wonderful, perfect.

This is a great recipe that can be altered a LOT and still be a great recipe. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey and I omitted the sausage entirely. I also left out the celery (because I forgot to pick some up at the grocery store) and also one can of the diced tomatoes, only because I didn't have any more room in the slow cooker! It makes a LOT, but it freezes and re-heats well. Thanks for a great starter recipe!

This really is a good chili, and a cupboard cleaner as well. It's a nice midway point between the sweeter Cincinnati style chili and the more familiar Tex-Mex.

I made this for a murder mystery party which was old west saloon themed.  Thinking everyone would snack on all the different munchies available, I only made enough for 16 regular servings.  (There were 20 guests).  It was gone within 20 minutes.  Everyone asked about the chili.  Huge success.

This was probably the best chili I have ever had, even better than my mom's. The only thing I did differently was use ground beef, cut back on the cumin, add more tobasco, and used normal chili beans. I topped with sour cream and cheese.

I've made this twice already and both times it comes out amazing! I would recommend making it on the stove so that the water evaporates as it cooks. The second time I made it, I prepared it in a slow cooker and it was thinner than on the stove.  But it was still sooooo yummy!

My family and I LOVE this chili recipe.  I leave out the jalapenos, and replace the tabasco with buffalo wing sauce that's a little less spicy.  I also only add half the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper.  This way it's mild enough for grandma and the kids but still has a small kick, and if the adults want it spicier they can add their own tabasco!  So Yummy that I can't say enough about it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Sean.

This is a really really good chili. I am not a big chili person but I ate my weight in this. Great flavor and texture, made as is. Husband thought it could of been a bit spicier in the bite but really enjoyed the heat it left afterward. Thanks!

Loved it! I love too cook but in the past haven't loved chili so this was actually my first time making chili. It was simple and delicious. My husband cannot stand tomatos so I used sauce in place of the canned tomatos. Turned out great!

Absolutely amazing. I made this for a party and everyone loved it and came back for seconds! It is a huge recipe and the pot was scraped clean! I made it exactly as called for the day before, let it sit overnight and then let it simmer again most of the next day before serving. It was perfect, my boyfriend is already begging me to make it again!

Made this recipe yesterday for a local chili cook off.  Not only did everyone rave about it but it took 1st place out of 12 entries!!  The only thing I did different was left out the bell peppers and that was only because I forgot to pick them up at the grocery store.   A couple people commented they thought it was a bit to spicy/hot but the majority enjoyed it.  I did not even have a scoop left over!!  This is definitely a keeper

I made this chili a few weeks ago, and ate it for lunch and dinner the whole weekend! The list of ingredients may seem exessive, but it is incredibly easy, and the flavors are so complex and layered, it's okay if you're missing a few of the components. For example, I omitted the dried basil and beer bc I didn't have it, and used just 1 bouillon cube instead of 4 to cut back on the sodium. Also, I used 2 cans of chili beans and substituted the third for a can of no salt added pinto beans and an extra can of rinsed and drained kidney beans. My boyfriend absolutely loved it too and when I brought some into work and heated it in the microwave everybody walked over to my desk to see what the wonderful smell was. Best chili ever!

Wow, this chili was great!  I made this for my daughter's birthday party, which was the first time (risky I know)...It was fairly simple and came out great.  I made it as-written minus the onions, celery, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and green chile peppers since there were several children at the party.  Everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make it again!

Best I have tried.  I simplified the assembly process by buying the diced tomatoes with the chiles and peppers mixed in.  I think the sausage is the key.

I tried to follow the recipe wherever possible.  I did use Tastefully Simple Bacon Bacon dip mix in place of bacon bits.  It took me a long time to chop up but I enjoyed the remainder of the beer and took my time.  I brought some into work for my co-workers and I got recipe requests, I will definitely make this again.  It was well received.  It had a nice even heat to it. Great Chili!

This is a very good recipe, but I probably won't make it again.  The sheer quantity of ingredients made me think that this was going to be the very best chili I had ever had, that it would be somehow gourmet and that one of these ingredients was one that I had been missing out on before.  It was very good, but it wasn't what I had hoped it would be (that being my all-time favorite!).  So, while it's tasty, I'm going to continue my hunt for the perfect chili...

Wonderful recipe!  My only change was I used half of the chili powder and half of the cayenne pepper.  Still plenty of spice for us.  Lots of leftovers as there are only two of us.  Froze the rest for another 3 dinners. Will definitely make again.

This was an excellent chili.  I opted to cook the Chili in the crockpot, and only used 1 can of tomato paste.  It was extremely spicy and had to mix in apple sauce for my 5 year old son.  This was even after halving the red pepper and Tabasco sauce.  Next time I will use 1/4 of the recommended hottening spices.  We used ground turkey and it turned out fantastic.

I love this recipe!I entered a chili cook-off at church and have read about 50 recipes from all different sources to come up with a special recipe. I did personalize the recipe somewhat (sauteed veggies, deglazed pan with beer, added chipotle chilies with ancho sauce and substituted beef stew meat for ground beef and sausage) but kept the spices and the rest the same.  I came in 2nd place (lost to an excellent chicken chili)!  I really love to browse the recipes on this site and customize to my family's preferences.  This is a great place for inspiration!

Finally! I almost gave up making chili until I found this recipe.  Only changes I made were using (1) 14.5 ounce of petite tomatoes w/jalapenos and (1) 8 ounce of tomato sauce. Used (1) full beer as well.  Everyone loved it!  Addicting...

I can honestly say this is one of the best chili recipes I have ever tasted.  I usually try to make recipes exactly as they shown the first time, and then make changes later to suit my tastes.  My husband and I like things on the spicy side, so the only changes I made to this recipe was to use hot italian sausage and 2 jalepeno peppers instead of the green chilies.  I also used 3 strips of crumbled bacon, because anything with bacon is even better with more bacon! Served with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top, it was absolutely perfect.  The combination of meats and spices was so complex and the heat gave it a kick without being too overpowering.  Froze half to eat later.  Can't wait!

I omitted and added a few different ingredients/spices and it was amazing.  It yielded much more than 10 servings. We ate two bowls after cooking it, froze four servings and had 8 more servings left that were passed out at work the next day.

Excellent chili for a party, or anytime.  I'm not a huge fan of spicy recipes, so I was a little concerned.  However, this was perfect.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I added some extra beans to make it go further, and I used a pound of venison italian sausage instead of pork italian sausage.  I don't like venison much, but I honestly couldn't tell it was in there.  I also forgot to buy the chilis, so I left those out.  It went over very well at our Super Bowl party:  I'll make this again!

Best chili ever!  I top each bowl with shredded cheese, sour cream and fresh diced tomatoes.  I store the leftover in mason jars for perfect portions to eat the next few days.

Excellent!  I made this lowfat by substituting ground turkey for the ground beef and sausage and omitted the bacon. I used a full can of beer....much better.  Also rather than all that chopping....I used 2 bags of frozen diced onion, celery, green and red pepper mix. ...much easier.   I took advice of others and eliminated the hot sauce, but it was still a little too spicy.  After some research, I found that if you add 2-3 peeled whole potatoes to the chili and leave in for approximately 30 minutes and then remove and serve,  it really does tone down  the spicy heat. This is my new chili recipe!!

EXCELLENT!!!!  I have tried numerous chili recipes and I have to say this is the very best by far!!!!!   I did EVERYTHING according to the recipe directions and served it during a card party, EVERYONE raved over it.  It was such a hit, I know I passed this recipe to at least 7 different families.

Very good. I will make this again. I omitted the celery and green chili peppers, substituted kidney beans and black beans(rinsed and drained) for 2 cans of chili beans, and substituted 93% lean beef for ground chuck.  I cooked in our crock pot for about 7 hrs.

This was a great recipe, well-deserving of 5 stars.  You can make your own alterations (I used 4 different cans of beans-chili, chili in spicy sauce, light red kidney, and white kidney- and added strip steak cubes, among other things) but it's such a good base I see it being hard to mess up :) Everyone LOVED it!

Made this chili for the Super Bowl based on the number of good reviews it got and I was not disappointed.  Best chili I ever made and everybody really liked it.  I grilled a rib eye and chopped it up to use instead of the Italian sausage and did not put in the celery.  I tried it after 2 hours and all I tasted was spice but a couple more hours of simmering made it taste incredible.  Highly recommend this one!

I hate to sound redundant, especially because I rarely review the recipes that I use, but this is the best chili we have ever had...and I am a Hoosier!  A couple of tweaks that others have done and some new:  I used three pieces of crumbled bacon, doubled the beer, used fire roasted diced tomatoes and substituted a bag of frozen "fresh" corn for the red and green peppers (due to allergies).  The corn added some really nice texture. I also mixed up the beans a bit, 2 cans of black, 1 can of kidney and 2 cans of chili (didn't drain the "hot" can of chili beans as the recipe suggests).  Served with shredded sharp cheddar, light sour cream and chopped green onion.  Fabulous!

I made this for the first time for our Superbowl Party and it was outstanding!!! With a few picky adults, and 14 children running around I was worried about it being too spicy so I did add the chile peppers but omitted the Tabasco and Cheyenne pepper.  I checked it as it cooked and the spice was perfect!  We live in a small town and 1 lb. of italian sausage was not available so I substituted with a pound of regular sausage. I also added 4 cups of beef broth to it b/c my hubby prefers more "soup" to his chili. Served it up with sharp cheddar, real sour cream, and corn chips.     I was also concerned about this making enough for our group of 20 but rest assured you will have plenty! As it was, this "10 serving" recipe made a full stockpot of the best chili. All our guests raved about how fantastic it was and I had to make copies of the recipe to give out before the game even started!!  Kudos!!!!

Excellent recipe.  I follow it to the letter.  My family also likes when I substitute shredded beef that I slow-cook in the crockpot instead of ground chuck.  I don't have leftovers after serving this chili at a party!

Thanks for the best chili recipe.  I made this for a chili cook off at work and won first place! I choose your recipe because the name of it caught my eye, my daughter goes to Purdue.  I followed the recipe as described and let it sit overnight to let the flavors blend.  It was hard not to eat it while it was cooking and the house smelled oh so good. Everyone loved the chili and I had several people ask for the recipe.  I've already been asked to make this again.  Great recipe!

I just love this recipe. And I follow the recipe as written.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Every time I make it I double or triple the recipe so I can give some to others...Fabulous recipe.  Go Boilermakers.

This is easily the best chili that not only I have ever made, but that I have ever eaten! I've had it simmering on the stove for about 2 hours now and it's to die for! I'm going to let it simmer another hour before letting it rest.   I made this for my hubby to take with him to work tomorrow in honor of Superbowl Sunday. I can't wait to see how it tastes after it has time to sit.  I pretty much followed the directions as written except I used ground venison instead of ground beef. Used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chili's, and I used  Chipotle flavored tabasco for even more smoky flavor.  Wonderful recipe!! You can't go wrong with this one. It's about as close to perfect as it gets!

Woohoo!  This chili helped me win the coveted Hottest Chili award at our chili cook-off!  Everyone loved it.  It has a great balance of flavors, has complexity and appealed to a wide variety of tastes. I didn't change a thing - I only added extra jalapenos for my personal taste.  A+

The flavors were deep and rich, I didn't use sausage because I didn't have any, so I used 1 lb. of bacon instead. There were alot of ingredients but that's what gives the chili the layers of flavors. I used one can of cannellini beans in place of a can of chili beans because we like a mixture of different beans. Served with shredded cheddar, sour cream, chopped scallions and tostido chips for dipping...YUM !

This is possibly the best chili I've ever tasted.  Made it according to the recipe then divided it and kicked up the heat on one half since I prefer it spicier than my husband.  We enjoyed it with macaroni added.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, looking forward to making it again.

This recipe deserves every star and more.  I made this for a church potluck and they were scraping the pot for every last bit. It was easy to make too, because all you do is throw everything in there and enjoy.    A word of forewarning to first-timers like me-- I couldn't find the chile peppers so I figured I could just jalepeno peppers instead. The chili turned out fine but my hands were burning the rest of the night from handling the peppers bare-handed! Be careful if you decide to stray from the recipe!

Lots of ingredients, but WORTH EVERY DIME!  I even added a few more LOL.  I used hot italian for my sausage, 4 serranos instead of green chilies, added 1/2 cup strong brewed coffee & 1 teaspoon cocoa (hubby is from Ohio...had to throw in a little Cincinnati for him). **********10 stars for this one Mighty Purdue!

This chili is a great base recipe. I made too many adjustments to list but none really altered the ingredients. The only thing that was a lot different was that I used chipoltles in adobo for heat and added some chopped smoked sausage. I pretty much used the same seasonings just more or less of them. This is a great recipe to work off of.

Even makes a good vegetarian chili if you substitute the meat products for meat alternatives (i used Boca crumbles and diced Morning Star beef fajita strips).

I was a little hesitant to make this since it had so many ingredients but I never made chili before and had such a taste for it. It is delicious and I will make again.  I did add the beer (which I was hesitant to do since hubby does not like the taste of it) and we could not even taste it.  Truly delicious!

Although I didn't care too much for this recipe, my husband did, and so did most of the members of our yacht club. I won third place in our annual Chili contest last night - the only time I've won an "Award" for anything I've cooked. No cash or prizes were involved (darn), but I still have this site to thank. Now I just need to find a recipe for Chili Rellenos!

This was the best chili recipe yet. This is what I used (due to what we had)I didn't use beer, can't stand the taste. I used 2 pounds of stew beef and 1 pound of hot pork sausage, canned green chilles, no hot sauce, 28 oz (i think) can of mild Busch chilli beans and 15 can kidney beans.  I had garlic fire roasted diced tomatoes.

The best home-made chili I've ever had!!!  I thought that this would be too hot from the sounds of the ingredients but it is the perfect combination without too much heat - if my kids are sharing it, I just leave out all of the chili powders and they love it.  This is a great recipe that's definitely a favorite!

Very good. I made this for our tailgate at Giants Stadium. Unfortunately, the only good thing was the Chili. I did not have any bacon bits, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out very good.

I thought this recipe was perfect.  I'm not a big fan of chili recipes with lots of beans, or chili for that matter, but this chili was the right amount of everything.  We didn't have the chili peppers or the red bell pepper, and only let it simmer for about an hour.  But it was some of the best chili I have had.  I wish I found you while tailgating at Purdue, thanks for the post.  Will definately make this again.  Go Boilers!

I substituted a large portion of the ingredients, but kept the spices the same. Very versatile chili.

We really like this chili. I froze the leftovers in qt size bags, my wife & I actually found the leftovers to be more flavorable.  I have make it every year usually in November & January. Enjoy a bag of the leftovers about every week. I follow the recipe exactly. Excellent on cold winter nights.

Great chili.  Had people over for Christmas party and it was a huge hit. Froze leftovers and will have them at New Years.  The sausage adds a element of yumminess.  Added a can of kidney beans because we like e'm.

This really is the best chili recipe I have ever tasted. And everyone that tries it absolutely loves it. Here is a tip - to make it healthier, go for the "low sodium" beans and other ingredients. You can also try turkey sausage instead of pork and use the leanest ground beef you can find. You will never taste the difference and it will trim out a lot of the fat and sodium in this recipe. Also - make sure you make extra. This only gets better as it ages and you can enjoy it for a week.

I had to make this as my husband is a Purdue grad.  We both really enjoyed it.  As with most chilis, this tastes better the next day but it's hard to wait that long  since it smells so good as it cooks.  To add something different, I sometimes add small chunks of beef stew meat that I've pre-cooked in the oven (it's a great way to tenderize cheaper meat cuts).  Other than that, I don't change a thing.

This is the best chili recipe I have ever made. The only modifications I made were to add a chopped jalepeno and to cut the cayenne pepper in half. The spicy beans add enough extra kick. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this chili. The recipe made a good amount- and it tasted even better the next day. This had a nice "kick" to it, but wasn't overly spicy. Easy to make!

Made this for a football party, the guys loved it! I left out the tobasco sauce because it had enough heat. Other than that I followed the original recipe ingredients. I cooked this in a crock pot high for four hours, then re-heated on low the following day. It was awesome!

Very good chili. I used 2 jalapenos without the seeds and it had enough heat to make my lips and mouth tingle, but not burn. I also added more sugar because I like chili a little sweeter.

This was awesome. I have used other chili recipes, but this will become my main one.  Left out the sausage (preference), used 3 lbs of ground beef and adjusted the tomatoes and paste and beans accordingly. I used kidney beans and black beans. Left out the bacon (again preference). Used O'Doul's beer as that is all I had, couldn't tell the difference.  I eyeballed the spices thought that as written it sounded a little too hot for our taste, so I went easy on the hot sauce and cayenne, and I only used one hot pepper. It was perfect. After about an hour, I found  I did need to add a little more cayenne. The taste does get better the longer it simmers. Enjoy!!!

Good recipe.  Husband loved it. I would omit the added salt next time. The other ingredients have enough sodium. It was a bit too salty for me though.

I had only made chili like 2 times before and this was was definitely the best!!  I did make my own real bacon bits, then sauteed the onions, peppers, celery, and garlic in the bacon drippings. I browned the hamburger meat and sausage. The rest is simple, just add everything in the same pot! I used one big can of diced tomatoes and one big can of diced tomatoes with the basil seasoning. I also only used 3 cans of beans (one with the spicy sauce and 2 drained) instead of 4....3 was plenty to me. I also used brown sugar instead of white as others had suggested. We couldn't wait till the next day to eat it cause it smelt too good so we ate it that night and it was delicious....even better the next night, and the night after....and so on! haha  This is very good and will be my chili recipe from now on. You should definately give this one a try! Thanks!

I made this for my sons birthday party and it has a huge hit!  Once I gathered all the ingredients I realized I didn't have a pot big enough.  I went to the local Hispanic store (latin people cook for huge crowds!)and bought a huge pot for $40! lol Everybody loved the chili!! I can't wait to make it again now that it's getting cold here.

Add me to the list of people who tried this out for a chili cook-off. 1st place of 11 chilis! I modified it somewhat - no beer, 1/2 the tabasco, mixed kidney and black beans. We'll be using this again. My wife (who doesn't like chili, as a rule) thinks it's great, too. She's an even more discriminating judge.

The longer you cook it, the better it gets.  I cooked it on Friday evening and also let it cook all day Saturday.  That helped a lot.

Chili was my husbands favorite meal of mine before we stopped eating meat, and he's been really disappointed in the vegetarian versions I've tried. I made this recipe tonight (with reconstituted TVP -- 2 cups dry, soaked in 4 cups water -- instead of beef/pork), and it was a total hit. I didn't find this recipe too spicy, though I did omit the cayenne and chili peppers (I didn't have either). I will continue making it this way, considering how well received it was by my husband and three picky kids. I served it with homesteader cornbread.

We loved this chili!  Being from Indiana I can appreciate the Boilermaker part however we're Notre Dame fans here!!  By the way it was VERY spicy/hot the day I made it, the next day however it was not nearly as hot and tasted totally different.  Weird, you'd think it'd be the other way around!

My husband made this chili and it was delicious! I am normally not a chili fan, but this recipe has changed my mind. After cooking the meat, he made it in our crock pot and let it slow cook for 6 hours, which I'm sure added to the taste. It filled our crock pot to the rim! It's also beautiful--many colors and textures simmering together. We recommend this highly!

Some of the best chili I have made and ate. I really liked the the flavor the peppers gave to it and it had enough spice to make me happy. When I make it again I am going to add a little more spice to it but it was very good. It was a thick and hearty soup rather than on the soupy side which is more to my liking also. I have no complaints about this chili and will definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe to a T, let it cook about 3 hours and turned out good. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I guess all chili tastes the same to me. I could get the same chili in a much shorter time. All in all, great recipe, but will probably stick to my quicker recipe.

Don't let the long ingredient list scare you.  This is easy and delicious.  I used Jimmy Dean spicy sausage and substituted three cans of Rotel for the diced tomatoes.  Also used one jalepeno in place of the chili peppers.  Outstanding.

This is a great chili recipe.  The chili has a nice kick to it, not too much.  Very meaty.  It was fairly easy to make as well.  Plus, I had to try it since I am a fellow Boilermaker as well. I omitted the celery because I did not have it on hand, but other than that, I made the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make this chili again...especially on a cold, winter night.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried many chilli recipes and this is by far the best!!!  The only thing I did differently was to use a ground pork, veal, beef mixed instead of just beef.

this is delicious!  i was looking for a BIG pot of chili recipe & this hit the spot.  i didn't use the sausage just another pound of beef, it would've been really good w/some venison though.  it was too spicy for my family.  my son & i were the only ones who could handle.  will definately be making this again & again this winter.

This chili recipe is amazing!  I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I omitted the bacon bits b/c I didn't have any handy and added a whole bottle of ginnus.  This is going to be a staple!!

So yummy!!!  Used pork sausage meat and ground beef. Forgot the beef bouillon. Downed the spices, and should even more next time for the kids sake.  Did kidney, black and brown beans, and 3 cans of diced tomatoes.  Added a can of mushrooms.  3/4 c. beer.  Browned the meat and onions, then threw it all in the crockpot for the day.  Yummiest chili I've ever had!!!

Amazing. Spicy, so if you have little ones you should tone it down a bit. My 13 year old daughter loves to make it. I don't add the sugar or the bacon, but it makes no difference. If you think of substituting the beer or not usinng it at all, BIG  MISTAKE! The beer gives it flavor. I've made this about a million times, still love it every time.

I made this in the crockpot, set it to low and slow cooked all day.  My friends just loved it.  The fritos are a must.  I cut the chili beans down from 3 cans to 2 cans.  Great recipe!

Used ground kangaroo instead of beef. Threw in a jar of salsa con queso. Topped with sour cream, parmesean and mozzerella. Had red pepper flakes and jalepenos available for those that like it hot! Made a wok full of it, it was consumed in no time by about 7 or 8 people.

This turned out great.  I left out the beer and tomato paste, and this was still a winner with my family.  Not too hot for the kids and still had a small kick.  Thanks for a great recipe.

VERY GOOD CHILI!!! I left out the tomato paste and used garden tomatoes because I have a surplus of them. Also, I left out the beer and used only 1/2 all of the hot spices to suit my 4 year.

My fav new Chili!  We used 1 lb of ground beef (to make smaller portion and save cash).  We also used 2 cans spicy chili beans, white onion, skipped celery, only used 1 green bell pepper, skipped bacon bits, used beef broth instead of bouillon and an entire bottle of Pilsner Urquell.  Throw some sharp cheddar and chopped red onions on top and fresh French bread on the side.  Enjoyed by the whole family on a cold Colorado night.  mmm mmm Good!

I follwed this recipe exactly and LOVED it! It was my first attempt at making chili and I definitely chose a winning recipe. I personally think it could have been even more spicy, but then I love really spicy food. I did not add extra spice since I wasn't the only one eating it. Some of the other diners don't like things super spicy and they found this recipe to be have a perfect balance of flavor and heat. It was a big hit, I'll definitely make it again.

Outstanding! Makes ALOT so use a big pot. Make exactly as called for in the recipe or do as I did and leave out some of the hotter items so it's not quite as hot if you want the kids to share. Per my beer expert husband, DON'T USE LIGHT BEER or a Stout...use a quality beer.

This recipe is awesome.  It has the most ingredients of any recipe that I have attemped but I pulled it off and it was well worth the effort.  My wife told me that I could probably cook it in the crock pot and make it simpler to tend or not tend to.  Very, very good, I don't think I'll eat canned chili again.

This is hands-down, the best chili I have ever tasted/made.  The only change I made was to drop the bell peppers and substitute hotter peppers like serranos and habs.  I  like mine to make a 4-Alarm chili look like weak sauce

This chili was great! I only used 1/4 of an onion and no chili peppers. Instead of chili beans, I used kidney beans. The Italian sausage gave it a very good flavor. I will undoubtedly be making this chili recipe again in the future.

I just tasted the finish results and it is amazing.  This is THE BEST chili I have ever eaten.
I'm taking it to Cinco De Mayo Party tomorrow and I know it is going to be a big hit.  I'm printing up copies of your recipe because I know people are going to ask me for it.

This is a very good recipe.  I followed it exactly except I omitted the celery and tobasco (didn't have any or either).  Served it with shredded cheddar and sour cream.  It had just the right amount of spice.  YUM!

A great hearty meal.  I sliced up cooked brats and added extra spices to give even more zip.  My husband can't wait for football season now.  Thanks.

Amazing - the best chili I have ever had!  I left out the hot chilis, most of the chili powder, celery, and bacon but added a whole bottle of beer and used hot italian sausage.  I can't wait to make this again!

Awesome this chili was great. It didn't even get to cook for the full two hours before half of it was eaten no one wanted to wait for it to cook. Everyone raved about this chili. The only thing i changed was i added a can of stewed tomatoes and about 1.25 pds of hamburger instead of 2 pds. Will def. make again!

I made this for a chili competition with my friends.  Unfortunately I didn't win any awards, but everyone really enjoyed the chili.  My signature chili is the Georgia Peach Chili, which is basically a chili with peaches in it.  Last years chili was awful, very bitter aside from the peaches so I was looking for something that had a lot more flavor and wasn't bitter.  This recipe is it.  I followed it exactly (except for adding peaches) and I really enjoyed it, no bitter after taste, just lots of wonderful flavor.

I love this chili recipe!!  Everyone raves about it.  It is really easy, too!  It has a long list of ingredients, but don't let that fool you into thinking that this is difficult to make.  I don't make any major changes to the recipe, although I do leave out the sausage.  Just a personal preference.  I have tried it with ground turkey, ground beef, and a mixture of the two.  I think that the beef or the mixture is the best.  Also, I sometimes make changes based on what I have in the pantry.  I use 2 cans of chili beans with sauce, and more tomatoes.  It is a little spicy, so if you're sensitive to spicy food, cut back on the cayenne.  We love the spice!!  In the summer I like to serve this with lots of shredded lettuce, fresh chopped tomatoes, grated cheese, cilantro, and corn chips.  It lightens it up a little for the hotter weather.  Try this chili.  You'll love it!!

This is a very good chili recipe.  It is not "THE ONE" for us, but everybody ate it and liked it.  We just were not "wowed" with it. The only things I did differently was I substituted a can of beef broth for 1 bullion cube, and didn't add the tobasco or chili peppers(too hot for little kids).  Oh, and I sauteed the green pepper and onion, I wish I would have done the celery and red pepper also.  And then threw it in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  Very easy and good taste...we are just looking for something else....

Fabulous!!!!!!!
I have a habit of "doctoring" things up. Adding this, taking away this. I was tempted, but didn't alter anything except the chili powder. I did keep it simmering for another half hour.

I was tired of my 8 item chili so I thought I'd use a recipe to draw from.  I left a few ingredients out because I am a spicy wimp but this still turned out to be the best chili I have ever made!  Thanks for sharing this!

I made this for our guests today. I doubled the recipe, making one pot mild and the other spicy. For both, I used ground turkey & ground turkey sausage, beef broth rather than beer, black beans, chili beans, pinto beans, ranch style beans, and chili ready diced tomatoes. For the mild, I used canned, mild green chiles, omitted cayenne and hot pepper sauce. For the hot, I used fresh roasted green chiles, crushed red pepper and chipotle sauce. I cooked on high in the crockpot for 4 hours. I served the chili with frito's and topped with cheddar cheese, diced onion, sour cream & jalapeno's. Most everyone went back for seconds and some thirds...everyone raved how good the chili was! This is the perfect dish to feed a crowd. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

Of course I had to modify it for my taste and preference, however, I cannot say how right now.  I am still working on my secret recipe to win chili cook-offs. I came in second last year.  I think I am going to win this year.

Won 1st Place at our local chili cookoff.  My first cookoff ever. I entered this in the HOT category. It was perfect...not too hot but just enough spice to give it a good kick.  Excellent recipe that received rave reviews. I didn't change a thing. I did prepare it the night before as directed, blotted any grease with a paper towel then refrigerated it overnight. The next morning I put it on simmer/low (no lid) for about 3 hours prior to the cookoff.  Just an FYI -a 12qt. stock pot was perfect to simmer the chili in.  
Served it on warm/low in a crockpot.
EXCELLENT!

This is my 2nd time making chili and it turned out great! The number of ingredients required was alittle overwhelming at first, but since I bake and cook alot I soon realized I had 3/4 of the ingredients. This was easy to prepare and the flavor is likeable for everyone. Definitely recommend.

What awesome stuff this is!!  My guests loved it, and proclaimed it the best chili they had ever eaten.  I didn't have the italian sausage, so I used extra ground beef instead.  Next time I'm adding cubed sirloin.  I used a can of diced green chilies instead of a green chile, and I left out the tabasco sauce - it was spicy enough without it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great chili recipe!

Allow yourself an hour + for prep time - no way it can be done in 30 minutes - unless of course you are mighty mouse.

My husband said this is the best chili he's ever eaten. That's saying a lot, because he has been a cook-off judge several times! I'll be entering this at the annual Christmas chili cook-off. I thought it was wonderful, spicy, yummy. It does make a lot, but is ever so much better for leftovers. The kids have been eating it up, even for breakfast! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I do believe the fresh ingredients are what makes it. Worth the time spent chopping and dicing. Thanks for a great recipe. Now my family won't have to eat my feeble attempts at making my "own" chili.

This is a great chili.  It's thick, meaty and spicy.  I did not include the sausage as I didn't have any on hand, and I halved the beef boullion and salt as other reviewers said this dish was too salty.  The only other thing I did differently was I did not add beer (the last recipe I tried called for a can of guiness and I really did not like the taste), and added one cup of red wine instead.
This is a keeper, and we will definitely make this one again! Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe was so so.  I had to add tons of Tabasco to try to get it spicy enough to eat.

The others ate it but thought it was pretty regular tasting.

I 1/2'd the recipe and it still made tons of it.

Excellent recipe!  Very spicy, but I like to serve with some sour cream and cheddar cheese on it which mellows it just enough to be perfect.

Excellent Chili for Super Bowl!  Everyone loved it at our party.  My alterations/substitutions: I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 1 can of beans in tomato sauce.  I also used spicy italian sausage.  It is well worth the effort to prepare.

I made this chilli for my whole family and they loved it. The only thing I omitted was the celery and bacon bits and instead I added 6 diced rashers of bacon. It makes absolutely loads of food, especially if you serve it with cheese, sour cream, jacket potatoes and salad like I did. The truly great thing about this recipe though is that almost all the ingredients are just everyday stuff that you keep in your cupboard at home so you don't have to dash off to the shops before making it.

Made this for a Super Bowl party.  Made on Saturday for the Sunday game.  Followed the recipe exactly except poured in the entire bottle of beer.  Served with some Spanish rice, crackers, cheese & sour cream.  Awesome!!

Fabulous!  Best chili I have ever had.  I was a bit taken by how many ingredients there are in this, but they all truly blend well to make a superb taste.  I made it exactly as is and everyone loved it. I will make this again.

I kept the basics of this recipe (the beef and sausage) but for the rest used what I had available around the house. Most of the ingredients were the same though and this was the yummiest chili ever. Even my non-chili-eating-9 year old had himself a second helping.

Thank you, MIGHTYPURDUE22.  For two years now, I have made this recipe and it always comes out fabulous.  If I could, I would rate it ten stars.  Even though sometimes I have to make some minor substitutions based on my pantry stock, the recipe is still absolutely delicious.  The spice is just right, and I love to add the corn chips and a little dab of sour cream when serving it.  And because I am a graduate of Purdue, I especially enjoy serving Boilermaker Chili to my Illini husband and to our many other Big Ten alumni friends! :)  BOILER UP!!!

I love trying different chili recipes and this one ranks right on up there with the best. This chili actually kept it's consistancy in the fridge, didn't thicken up too much like some chili recipes do when chilled. I pretty much stuck to the recipes except that I added 2 chopped jalapeno peppers to the mix.

Great recipe.  The only thing that I did different was add one can of Rotel and I used canned green chiles.  I added bbq sauce and 3-bay leaves because I add that to all of my spaghetti based sauces.  My chili turned out a little sweet and a little spicy.

The BEST chili I have eaten. I agree with most everyone else, chilling it overnight enhances the flavor. A few modifications I made:
Three cans of beans (instead of 4)
1 cup of beer
For the diced tomatoes, I use the "Zesty Jalapeno" flavor
I use three jalapenos (instead of chile peppers)
Serve with fresh jalapeno slices for garnish.

This is a great chili for those who want everyone in a crowd to enjoy. Keep extra hot sauce available for those who like to Burn their taste buds. I used chili beans in medium sauce, 1/2 the hot sauce and it was easily mild enough for most people.
  I'll definitely make it again!!

Really really good, made this for a halloween party, it was delicious as-is.  I wouldn't change a thing. 

It really freezes great. too.  We eat it in bread bowls or with cheesy cornbread.

Thanks!

I have made this recipe 3 times and every time it got rave reviews.  I added extra spicy chorizo sausage and a can of corn for added color, seemed to top it off.  I will make this for every houseparty we go to!

Awesome!  Made it for my chili cook-off at work and won.  Suggestion- use different types of beans.  People love the different colors (presentation is everything)!  I didn't use the beef cubes or bacon bits, and I added a bit more hot sauce than required.

This earns a full 5+ stars! I wasn't sure about a few of the ingredients (celery, bacon, bell peppers, Italian sausage) but was I ever wrong! This is the chili I will be making from now on. I used to use a kit, until now, that had Masa flour you added to the chili. I liked the flavor it gave, so I may try that in this recipe next time! My family likes hot food, and as this recipe stands, we did not find it hot- it did have some spiciness to it though. For us I would add some of my fresh x-hot Hatch chilies to give it a bit more kick. Spicy food is different to everyone though so it is hard to tell someone exactly how hot something is! I will be sending a batch, which by the way is HUGE to work with my husband. One batch of this is enough for 3 meals for my family of four. Served with Fritos, onions, cheese and sour cream! Comfort food at it's best! Yum!

OMG...this is soooo good.  I have made chili several times and it has NEVER been quite right.  This is PERFECT!  Made a few changes ONLY to the heat, it is quite hot and I am a medium heat person.  Here is what I did - 1 can each dark/light kidney beans.  1 can each hot/mild chili ready beans.  Replaced 1 can of the tomatos with chili ready tomatos and added 1 can ROTEL.  Omitted the celery, red pepper, chili peppers, hot sauce & cayenne.  Added an extra green pepper.  1 full cup of dark beer.   Still REALLY tasty just not as hot.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

I never made chili because I would just ruin it. I found this recipe and made it to the tee and it was a hit! I recently moved to North Dakota where I can make it throughout the winter. I added a couple of my own touches: 1 can of Rotel; 1 whole beer; diced tomatoes w/chili seasoning. I then serve it over the Corn Chip Scoops with sour cream and grated cheddar!

I am going to give this four stars only because it's a little too spicy for my taste, BUT my husband and in-laws LOVED it (they love food on the spicy side), and it was a huge hit when family came in to town. Hubby said it was the BEST chili he has ever tried. I would make it next time and separate into two batches (omitting the chili peppers, tabasco sauce and cayenne pepper in my portion). Otherwise, we added extra ground beef (3 lbs instead of 2) and 1 lb extra italian sausage.  Great recipe.

SOOOO meltingly tender! I simmered it on low for 5 hours and served it the next day.  I would reduce the cumin by helf next time. I also added a tin of canellini beans which worked perfectly.  FAB recipe!

I made this with ground beef, ground sausage and about 1/2lb steak chunks- which added a nice texture/flavor.  I left out the celery, whole peppers and beer- and rather than the spicy beans it calls for, I used basil and mild beans.  I cooked this in my crockpot and it ended up being so easy!  The best chili- way better than any canned or store-bought. It has a nice kick to it, but not overly spicy (I am not a spicy foods fan).  I Froze the leftovers (there was plenty!) and plan to make this again!  Thanks!

My husband has a number of "bachelor buddies" that visit often for home-cooked meals.  With this recipe, I will NEVER get them out of my house.  I get emails, phone calls, etc. requesting this chili on a weekly basis.  When word gets out that chili is on the stove, there are no less than six cars in my driveway within an hour.

This recipe is worth all the prep work, and you MUST make this the day before or it won't nearly be as tasty.

This chili came out really well! I am not a huge fan of beans, so I only used 2 cans, instead of 4. I live in the northeast and couldn't find "chili" beans, so I used kidney beans -- that's probably the same thing. I served this with sour cream and bacon bits, and it was a hit!

I loved it!  I made it with two pounds of ground turkey and one pound of ground sausage.  I looked like it was going to be very think and chunky when I first mixed everything together, but after simmering for two hours it was the perfect consistency.  My new favorite chili recipe!  I made it for a party at my house and got many compliments.

This is pretty good.  I was a little concerned about bacon bits, worcestershire sauce and celery in chili, but I went with it.  Overall, it was good, not great and could use a little more flavor.  Another reviewer said that this chili is 'salty' and I think I agree - I like my chili a little sweeter.

This was delicious.  I made it the day before a tailgate party and everyone loved it.  Actually, they not only loved it - many thought it was the best chili ever!  I doubled the recipe and didn't make any changes-none needed!  Thanks!

The only change I made in the recipe was to put one jalapeno pepper instead of two.  This chili is at the top of my list and I have made a lot of chili.  The family raved about it.

Look no further for a chili recipe-- this one is great!  It is spicy so if you want less heat, reduce the cayenne.

This chili was good, but not great like most other reviews said. I did follow the recipe as written, with the exception of cutting out one of the peppers.  I prefer a slightly sweet chili, while this recipe was more on the salty side.  Would not make again due to the number of ingredients, but most everyone who tried it said it was good.

Ok, if I had enough of this chili to fill a bathtub, I would bathe in it.  As it stood, it was all I could do not to plunge my head in the pot and start chowing.  Even after several bowls, and no more room in my stomach, I continued to eat.  There was so much flavor in the recipe.  As this was a family meal for young children, we didn't put too much heat in it.  No tabasco and a bit less cayenne.  I'm glad because it was just perfect for little old red-hots-are-too-hot me.  Other reviewers said it was even better the second day.  I'm tempted to eat it all now so there won't be a call of the phenomenal chili rousing me from my slumber and distracting me from my cubicle duties.  Forget Fabio, I'll fantasise about the chili.

I was commissioned to enter a chili cook off for our church. I sent out on a seach forthe best chili I could find. I saw this one and said man this should be good.anyway I embarked on my mission ans proudly took first place with this stuff. Its the best darn chili I have made ever hands down. The only thing I changed is instead of using groung chuck I sliced sirloin steak into small cubes. also I had half a pound of turkey laying aroung so I through that in as well. Also cooked up a pound of thick slied bacon and chopped it up and tossed it in (you can never go wroung with a litle extra bacon). And one whole beer. I will be making this from now on and have had many requests for the recipe. I will be passing down this bit of greatness to whoever asks. Thanks to the one who invented this stuff.

I like making this chili with Ground Turkey.  I also use black beans and kidney beans (2 cans each) rather than the chili beans.  This tastes great and isn't as labor intensive as some make it seem.  Give it a try and add your own twist and you won't be sorry.  This is a regular on my monthly menu.

I have to say "Hats off to the contributor of this recipe!"  Today we had a chili cook off at church and guess which chili won.  It sure was nice to be wearing the 2007 Chili Champ Apron.  I only made 3 changes to this recipe.  No celery, no beer and no green chiles.  Lucky for me I had a 2 bowls on Saturday night because it was gone by the time I got through the line today.  Thanks Again :-)

This was hands down the best chili I have ever made, in my opinion. When the guys get home from the Redskins game I can give you their reaction as well! I used hot italian sausage, Chili Beer for the beer (it actually has a chili pepper in the bottle... too spicy for me to drink but perfect for chili!), I added a bit of cinnamon, and thickened it up with corn starch. It's been simmering on the stove for 4 hours. This chili has the perfect amount of heat and spice for me. Absolutely delicious!

Though I did change quite a bit, this was a great recipe and it made my first attempt at beef chili a huge success. I omitted the onion and celery and added 2 cans of mushrooms at boyfriend's request. We love beans, so I did add a few cans... used 2 cans of chili beans with sauce, 1 can drained kidney beans, 1 can drained red beans, and 1 can of drained/rinsed black beans. I also didn't have any fresh peppers, so I used 2 cans of diced green chilis, along with using 2 cans of Rotel instead of just diced tomatoes. After combining everything, I split this into 2 pots so I could make my boyfriend a really spicy chili (he is a spicy food addict). To his I added 2 or 3 more tablespoons of Frank's Red Hot sauce, 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 cup of sliced jalapenos, and an additional teaspoon of cayenne. To my surprise, he actually didn't add more hot sauce to it... he said it was perfect (yay!). I left mine as it was and it was great... and even better reheated the next day. Thanks!

Excellent chili recipe with a great balance of flavors. Also, it's very amenable to changes/alterations. Due to what was on hand, I omitted the sausage and celery...and it still turned out fantastic.

Mine simmered for about 6 hours and really built up some kick. A little dollop of sour cream helped temper some of the fire.

Good, belly-warming stuff. Thanks!

This is the best chili recipe ever!  While it does take some prep  work, it is woth it!  I have made this recipe over 15 times.  Instead of 1/2 cup of beer I use one can of beer.  This helps to thin the chili out just a bit!

Insanely good Chili!!  We did make a few modifications, we used Chuck Steak instead of Ground Chuck. AWESOME CHANGE!  Our crock pot was so full, we had to leave out the sausage!  No harm, no foul.  The chili rocked.  We truly loved it more re-heated the next day. We are making it again next weekend and plan to make it Saturday and refrigerate it over night.  We are not Boilermaker Fans, but we sure love their Chili!!  Go Hoosiers!

Really great chili!  I was hoping it was as good as people had reviewed, and it was! I left out the bacon bits and only had enough chili powder for 2 tablespoons.  It still had plenty of kick.  I wasn't sure if you were suppose to drain the one can of chili beans in spicy sauce.  I decided not to drain it and it was fine.  I let it cook on low heat for 3.5 hours.  It wasn't too thick.  I was concerned at first because it looked really thick, but it was perfect.  Remember to stir every once in a while. Thanks for the recipe!

This chili is AWESOME!!! The only thing that I do is I put the celery in about an hour before serving to give it some crunch. I also cook up real bacon and put it in there. I get my bacon from the omish it seems to have a more "bacon" flavor to it.

I've been using this recipe for over a year, and just made another batch this morning.  My Purdue alumni husband (who is on his second bowl now) asked me if I had ever left a review for it and sadly I had not.  Well that changes today!  This is by far the best tomato based chili recipe I have ever made.  Yes, it takes a little time to prepare but it is so worth it.  I usually add two additional cans of chili beans, but that's only because we are a bean loving family.  Otherwise, the blend of herbs and "heat" are perfect! I've shared it with neighbors, taken it to work functions, and served it several times on our weekend football gatherings.  Everyone agrees that this is one great chili.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

The best chili ever! Made a few changes to cut some fat and calories. Here they are: used lean ground beef, hot turkey sausage, 2 cans of drained/rinsed kidney beans(couldn't find chili beans in spicy sauce), one 28oz can fire roasted diced tomatoes, 1 28oz crushed tomatoes, 1 14oz diced tomato in its juice, 1/2 can paste, used turkey bacon instead of bits, reduced the cayenne and hot sauce slightly, kept everything else the same. Omitted fritoes completely (although they would have been fabulous), and used reduced 2% fat shredded cheddar. My family loved this chili and it was worth all the work and adding all the ingredients. This made a huge amount, so I froze a lot and cant wait to eat it again. Comfort food at its greatest,will definately make for a crowd. Thanks for a great new chili recipe.

AMAZING! I got rave reviews from everyone who tried this! It does make a lot though. I filled 5 large mason jars with this (we ate one, gave 3 away, and froze the last). Making this again and again and again!

My husband is an amazing cook and whipped up this recipe for a tailgater last year and it was a HUGE hit.  I myself do not like chili, but this was so good I have asked him to make it several more times.  In fact, this weekend is the season opener and my birthday and I requested he make it for the party.  Fantastic!

this is definitely a good chili. for those of you who thought it was too tomato-ey or not beefy enough, I would recommend not draining the grease from browning the ground beef and sausage.  I made my own bacon bits, which made a difference too.  I also added a can of corn and the sweetness compliments the spice really well.  Lastly, I would recommend simmering for at least 4 hours - at 2 hours, the flavor isn't quite there yet.

I just have to write that this chili was very good. The only change I made was using a yellow bell pepper instead of green. I don't care for green bell peppers. Delicious!

Incredible chili recipe.  The only change or addition that I made was to use an IPA instead of a regular beer.  The extra hoppy/bitternes of the IPA brings out even more wonderful flavors in the already fantastic chili!

This chili was GREAT!!  It was so easy to make and so full of flavor. I didn't use the hot sauce, or add anymore heat as it had enough kick already. Perfect with cornbread!!

This is a wonderful chili - very meaty.  The heat is nice, not blazing but there.  It's amazing how chili changes over the 2 hours while it is cooking.  Husband and son thought this was the best chili they've ever had.

I've made simpler chili recipes before but after seeing so many 5 star reviews I wanted to try this one.  My husband and I thought this chili was "heavy"- next time I might try 1 less can of chili beans.  I also wasn't brave enough to use 1/4 c chili powder- I used about half of that.  It is definitely a tasty chili, but like other reviewers said, beware of the spice!

Well, I made this recipe Sat. night, followed the recipe to the tee, took the chili to church for a Chili Cookoff and Won 1st place.  I brought home about half of a very small bowl ( we're talking cereal bowl)of chili.  There were at least 15 other chilis there.  This was a very harty chili, I would cut back the spices a bit if you don't like spicy chili OR make sure you have some tissue on hand.

This was an AWESOME recipe for chili, lots of flavor and spice!  One thing I may change (I made it according to the exact recipe the first time) is that I may not use the italian sausage (I am not a sausage fan) and maybe will use just plain extra lean ground beef for the whole thing instead...however, the sausage wasn't too bad in this recipe.  Maybe even use some ground turkey in place of it, other than that, it was delicious!  Even better the next day...worth the wait!

I agreed to make 5 quarts of chili for a church sponsored Super Bowl chili sale - and this recipe comes out to exactly 5 quarts. I tasted it after I completed the recipe and thought "it's just chili" - I am not a huge chili fan.  However, I am giving it a 4 rating because those people who bought my chili were tracking me down to tell me how great it was. So, what do I know? Of course, it could have just been the chip and cheese that were provided with it!

This was awesome!  At first I didn't want to add all the "hot" ingredients, but ended up doing so and it was just perfect.  After a day or so in the fridge, however, it was mighty spicy!
Wonderful and definitely worth all the ingredients that are needed.

This chili is great!  I've had a lot of chili but this one tops them all.  It has the perfect blend of spices for me (it is spicy so if you're not a fan of very spicy foods, tone them down a little).  I have to say I've passed this recipe on to friends who absolutely love it.

This chili wasn't bad.  However, I don't think it was anything exceptional.  The only change I made was using canned chilis instead of fresh ones.  I probably would not make it again, but not because it was bad...it was just so-so for us.

Excellent! Browned ground beef and used ground turkey instead of the sausage. Added chopped up chorizo once everything was in the crock pot. Cooked it for about 8 hours.  Absolutely wonderful! Thanks!

I love this chili recipe.  As a former boilermaker myself, I took interest in this recipe, for I am a chili fan also.  I add refried beans to mine & a cutup jalepeno and more chili powder for a little more heat.  I cut down on the beer also, because I am not a beer fan and that takes some of the bitterness out.  Everyone always wants me to make my chili....so thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!  Go Purdue!!!

I love this recipe! It takes a while to put all the ingredients together, but after making it a few times it got easier.A little too hot for my taste so I adjusted the green chilis and the tabasco. My family loves this!

Funny to see this as the recipe of the day as I just made it for the first time two weeks ago. Many more ingredients and more trouble than the recipe I learned from my mom, but worth it. 
I don't think the canned spicy chili beans are available in my area, so I used 4 cans of kidney beans and one can of pork and beans, for a touch of sweetness. I was a bit intimidated by the list of spicy ingred. and since I wanted my kids to eat it I cut back the jalapeno and tabasco quite a bit and left the cayenne out altogether. It had a bit of bite - I wouldn't have minded a bit more- but we all liked it. 
Sounds weird, but we served it with a dollop of potato salad on top, and it was a great combination! I will definately make this again.

Excellent. I modified it a bit (used a slow cooker, increased veggies, increased heat). It was the best chili I've ever made and as much as we loved our old recipe, this is going to be our new one. Thank You!!!

This chili is absolutely wonderful.  My whole family enjoyed it.  My husband said this was the best chili ever.  I skipped the green chili peppers and it was spicy enough for us.  I will be making this chili again.

This was good chili, not great chili. I used ground beef as well as chuck steak, cooked it together, then threw everything into my slow cooker, cooked it for 2 days, and it was ok.  It was very filling, but isn't that ultimate chili recipe I'm looking for. Other than adding the steak, I followed the other ingredients as written.

I'm not much of a reviewer. But I've made this recipe 4 times now and it is the best chili recipe ever. What do I like about it most?
1. It doesn't have any crazy spices or weird things that I can't pick up at the local grocery store. 
2. I can easily remove portions (I usually only use half the beans) without degrading the recipe.
3. It uses beer, and you have to put beer in your chili.
4. It looks and tastes like chili should. Not in the "traditional" chili cookoff sense. But normal "I'm having a  super bowl party and I'm making chili" chili.

I would give this recipe my highest recommendation!

This chilli was fantastic!  I made this for my trip to the Meadowlands for a Giant's game and I had everyone around me asking me for the recipe! I did however use White beans and regular red beans instead of the hot beans.  Instead, I added some special hot sauce that I picked up on my last trip to North Carolina.  I also added white pepper to taste.  I simmered the entire batch for about 3.5 hours and then cooled it quickly on a plastic wrapped sheet pan for about 30 min, occassionally mixing to release more heat. Works great when you make a big batch so you don't heat your fridge up and it doesn't take 8 hrs to cool down.    Either way, WOW, what a great tasting and hearty recipe!  Thanks; I'll be using this one for years to come!!

This Chili is to die for!!  My hubby and I made it Sunday and then ate it for leftovers for three days!!  It was even better the days after because the flavors marinated and became more intense.  The only change I made was that I used ground turkey instead of beef...absolutely fabulous!!  I can't wait to make this again!

This chili was just ok. I followed it to the letter, and found it tasted pretty much like my normal chili (which is super basic and easy). I did love the addition of the sausage, but found certain ingredients (such as the bacon bits)didn't add anything at all.
Sorry!

In a word WOW!  I am an all recipes addict but never felt the desire to comment on a dish......even though many have been fantastic.  I couldn't help myself on this one!  So good.  It was a bit more work then my generic chili but well worth it.  It has an abundance of flavor and a nice bite to it without being overpowering.  I stuck to the recipe with only a few minor changes, I made my own bacon bits from real bacon and I sauteed the onions in a little of the bacon grease (what can I say.....I'm  a born southerner and you just can waste bacon grease!)  I also used the onion and garlic and pepper seasoned diced tomatoes.  It's not even done simmering and it's already so tasty I had to review it now!  Thank you for a truly impressive chili.....I'll never go generic again!

Hands down, this is the best chili I have ever had (not that I'm a chili afficionado or anything).  Even stayed up past my bedtime last night to make sure it simmered for a full 3 hours.  It was well worth it.  Had a bowl for lunch this morning.  The office went silly with the smell (I'll be making another batch next week). Didn't change a thing.  Followed it to the letter. Really, excellent recipe.  Thanks!

I'm sorry, but I can't give this recipe a high rating as is.  It's a decent base, but I had to make quite a few changes and additions to give it flavor and depth.  After adding a couple dashes of liquid smoke, more seasoning across the board, a can of tomato sauce and a little steak sauce, I won a local chili contest.  Unfortunately, I didn't write down the measurements of my changes.

I made this and froze it in two batches in a zip lock freezer gallon bag - pulled one bag out the other night - defrosted in the fridge over night then rewarmed it in the pot and it was OUTSTANDING! THe flavors blended and it was remarkable! Im making this a lot in the future, I can tell and the sausage isnt overpowering or anything - it blended beautifully!

This was delicious! I actually left out the red pepper, the chili peppers and the cumin, used real bacon instead of bacon bits (3 strips) added about 1 tablespoon of sugar, but wow! It was spicy but more of an aftertaste spicy, not too spicy... Will definitely make again!

Very, very good chili.  Best chili I have made, by far.  Just the right amount of kick to it.  The only thing that I will change next time is to cut the salt in half or maybe eliminate it completely.  It is just a touch too salty for my tastes, but this is a very minor thing.

Do not skimp on the ingredients, go through the effort of getting everything, it is worth it!  I do not think that there is a need for me to try any other chili recipes, this one defnitely sets the standard.

I made this for a family party/varied tastes and had to adjust the ingredients accordingly.  I omitted one green chile, cayenne, tabasco, beer and oregano and basil.  Then my daughter burned the bottom of the pot and I still had people asking for the recipe!  This is not only an easy recipe, but it's obviously very forgiving.  It's our new favorite.

I am normally not a chili fan, but I really liked this chilli a lot.  I have this thing about beans, especially chili made with kidney beans (which is why I tried this recipe--only uses chili beans). I used real bacon because I hate bacon bits, but this recipe is a keeper as is--no tweaking necessary.  I will add this meal to my regular rotation.  Thanks!

I made this awesome chili for my Halloween party and it was devoured and the little that was left was taken home by some.  For my taste, I cut down just a smidge of heat with just 1 chili pepper, little less of the cayenne and the tabasco - the heat was still hot but not overbearing.  Everyone raved about it.  Served it with the shredded cheddar and sour cream on the side.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, for I will surely use it again.

I made this for 30 people, so I tripled the recipe. I omitted the bacon, used dark red kidney beans, black beans and spicy chili beans, only put one pound of bulk Italian sausage even though I tripled all the other ingredients.  It was the best chili I've ever made - and I usually make excellent chili.  I made it on a Friday night, simmered it for 2 hours in a large pot, then transferred it to a slow cooker, let it cool off, and placed in the fridge until Sunday morning.  then I put the slow cooker on Sunday morning and let it simmer all day until 5 pm.  it was the BEST!!!.  I already want to make some more.

overall this is a great hearty chili...love the spicy bite...just be careful what type of beef bouillion cubes you use. i used knorr, they are quite a bit larger than just "beef boullion cubes"...thank goodness i only added two, which was one too many! two pototoes helped soak up some of the salt...like any chili it did taste better as time went on!

My husband made this chili this weekend and it was great!  I would rate it a 5, but if we had used spicy chili beans, it would have been too hot for us.  Instead, he just substituted all mild beans and followed the recipe.  AWES
OME!!  This is a great recipe...just a matter of taste as far as the spice goes.  The list of ingredients appears to be long, but when you really look at it, most items are already in your pantry.  I hardly had to buy anything at the store for this other than some fresh bell peppers.  THANKS!!!!

Followed everything to a T except instead of two green chili peppers, I used one Poblano Pepper and one jalapeno, and instead of Tabasco I used Gator Hammock's brand Gator Hot Sauce. I made it the day before, everything in a Crock-Pot after browning the meat, cooked on low for 3 hours, then on "keep warm"/simmer for an hour, then cooling in a container on the counter for an hour, THEN reheated on the stove the next day.  It was perfect.  People who rated this low probably ate it right after the suggested serving time, before the flavors could marry.  
Made a huge yield and tasted amazing.

I loved this recipe, my kids loved this recipe, people who weren't huge fans of chili loved this recipe and it won first place in a chili cook-off at my place of employment so I'm not sure what better endorsement there could be.

Unfortunately, I did make two small changes so none of what I'm writing is STRICTLY for the original recipe... However, of those changes one was accidental (I used three jalapeños instead of one due to a failure of my own reading comprehension) and the second change was to add 1.5 tsp of Chipotle chili powder on top of the 1/4 cup of regular chili powder. I personally prefer more of a smoky flavor so I tweaked it to suit my tastes. Other than that this recipe is perfect and makes plenty, I heartily recommend it.

Excellent.  I did however sub 1 can each- black beans, kidney beans and cannellini beans (rinsed) for the 3 cans of chili beans.  I also used Italian seasoning instead of Oregano (bc I ran out) , omitted the bacon bits - because I forgot them, and added a bit more sugar,  water instead of beer bc I couldn't bring beer to work (that's where I made this) and 3 hershey kisses to round out the taste.    I made this about 3 hours before the contest- and won 1st place- it's that darn good!

Not worth all the work and ingredients. Other chili recipes as good in less time and ingredients. I do not modify  recipes first time making them. Recipe was followed.

This is my go to recipe for chili with some modifications depending on circumstances. I don't always add beer, I usually get two green peppers maybe three no other colors needed. I usually use most of the celery not just three stocks. If you want it to not be as spicy don't add the cayenne and maybe do 1/8 cup chili powder. I also don't follow the bean choices, and I think it's weird to get a spicy can...

When I make it again I will only use one jalapeno not 2. I did enjoy it very much but my family does not care for spicy hot  dishes, so a compromise  is required.

Made this recipe for Super Bowl. Everyone raved about it. Looks like there are a lot of ingredients, but you will realize that most of them you already have on hand. Very easy and tastes delicious. I put it in the crock pot on high for about 5 hours and it was perfect!

Best chili EVER.  Worth the effort.   Everyone raves when I make it.  Switched the Italian sausage with brats,  casings removed.   Game changer.  Otherwise used exact recipe.

I made this for a Super Bowl party but doubled to enjoy the night before too. I used poblano pepper with jalapeño to lessen the spice a little, and chunks of stew beef instead of sausage. It is delicious. Truly delicious!! Just the right amount of heat, perfect seasoning. I will make this my go-to chili recipe now.

I have been making this chili since 2013. It is awesome! Over the years I have tweeted a little bit but not much. The last time I made it I added a bit of Habanero pepper, and pinto beans in sauce. Everyone loves it and I'm going to make it again on Saturday for the Super Bowl on Sunday!

Thank you MightyPurdue 22!!

I've made this countless times for home and contests. I've won just about every chili contest I've entered with this. I cook it overnight in a slow cooker.
I only make a few changes. I use serrano peppers vs Chile peppers. 1/4 cup chipotle chili powder vs dark chili powder. I add 8 Thai peppers, chopped not seeded. 
It turns out perfect every time!

This is the only chile recipe I make. Leave out the bacon bits and celery. Not needed.  Go for the NON italian sausage (the fennel seeds ruin the taste). Try using hot Hungarian paprika. Cant go wrong. Cheers.

My go to chili recipe! 
I have made it as is, I have had to alter due to some ingredients not on hand (no veggies), have made it with a mix of beans and have made it with Morning Star faux meat. I never alter the spices or beer. 
Everytime it amazing! 
Thank you for sharing!

This is THE BEST chili and would win a chili cookoff for sure!  Great flavor and fun to make!  I used black beans in  place of the kidney beans (my preference) By far the best tasting chili I have ever made and I'm 63 years old!

This is the best chili recipe I have found so far. 
I used two anaheim peppers and one large bell pepper only because that is what I had.  
I used one can of Cento peeled tomatoes only with no paste and did not add the beer.  I did thicken it at the end and used 1/4 of the cayenne. It was amazing thanks for posting it. 
You can adjust the heat as needed i added some homemade pepper sauce. I did not use spicy beans at times I find spicy beans bitter.

I love this recipe! I will make it again and again. I used the recipe conversion to change the servings to 32 and it worked beautifully. I omitted the green chilis, and replaced them with orange and yellow bell peppers. I also cut down on the amount of cayenne and hot pepper sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe! It was so good. I cook for a group of people every week and they have asked that I make this every time. Although I live in Texas, I am not from Texas and I love beans in my chili. I'm so glad I found this recipe.

I have made this many times. It’s a favorite for Christmas Eve family time. I put a new fun twist on mine for the heck of it. I took a 1/2lb of the pork and the hamburger and made little tiny meatballs. I added cheddar cheese, diced jalapeños and put cream cheese in the middle off them. Baked them before I added them. Fun little burst  of heat with the cream cheese to tame it.

This is a great recipe for a crock pot, slow cooker, but if you are in a hurry, saute the onions and veggies with salt and pepper to soften up first. Then add meat and beans and spices. It makes things go faster. Otherwise, awesome recipe!! Love the spices. So glad you use lots of spice.

Love this chili! Never thought I would say that about chili with beans, but the beans really enhance the flavor and it's got plenty of meat too!
I use raw bratwurst sausage instead of Italian - just a personal favorite and I add jalapenos for the green chili peppers. I have not found anyone that doesn't like it and if I take it to a party my pot always comes home empty!

Made this on a cold, snowy morning - perfect!   Had some for lunch - as it smelled SO good; and packed up some more for leftovers.  Even had some to freeze & enjoy sometime later this winter.  Toned down the hot spices - and added some of my favorites; everyone loved it!

This is my go to for a solid base chili. I won 3 years in a row at our company chili cook-off using this recipe as the base for my chili, just adding in a few other ingredients like sermon tips, or different sausage varieties, and spicier chilis. Once you get the base recipe down, its very friendly to change and to riff off of.

Even my IU (Indiana University) friends love this chili.  I use cinnamon and sugar to make it less spicy.  I really don't know what green chilies are so I have several different fresh chilies and that all work.

It's OK, but just too much tomatoes you can't taste the beef, or chili powder enough. Next time I drain the 28oz can or don't use so much paste. I was disappointed this was so well reviewed.

This is my favorite! This recipe is perfect the way it is.  Freezes well. My husband does smoked brisket so I sometimes use that instead of the pork & hamburger, only because its on hand.

This is the most delicious chili I’ve ever made. I’ve made it twice- first time with the called for beer, second time, I didn’t have any but actually liked the beer-free version better.  I don’t like chunky veggies so I blended the celery, onion, peppers in a food processor until basically a liquid. So, I got the flavors without the chunk. Make it- you won’t be disappointed!

I grew up in Northern New Mexico and have had many types of chili. This has a great texture, but the Italian sausage, Worchestershire sauce, and beef boullion send the flavor in a non-chili direction.  The red and green peppers and celery are okay additions, but rarely found in chili. The long simmer is perfect.

I love this recipe!  I have made it multiple times and tweak it a little each time (such as trying chipotle Tabasco sauce and obviously adding different types of peppers).  This has become the “standard” chili recipe for me.  Lots of compliments on the recipe and even won a neighborhood chili contest with it!

The only change would be a slightly bigger pot, lol.
I'll gladly make it again! And for just the two of us, we also tested the capacity of the new freezer to divide into future servings. Still tasted excellent. Plenty for several of those cold days.

When first cooked, it was a little spicy for me, however, the next day the heat had turned down just enough for it to be amazingly delicious!  I substituted Red Pepper Flakes and left out the chili powder.  I only used 1 jalapeño pepper since I knew that 2 would be too hot!

This is the BEST EVER chili. To people that rate it on how you modified it, go write your own recipe Geez! IDIOTS. My only complaint about this recipe is in the written directions it refers to cayanne, salt, pepper, sugar, and paprika none of which is on my ingredients list so I wing it every time. I make a 36 serving batch which fits perfectly in a 22 qt stock pot. YUM and YUM!

I made this recipe for a Chili Cook-Off and took 1st place.  I made it the day before letting it simmer all day.  I cut back on the spicy beans and hot sauce.   For the beer I used a chocolate stout which brought the flavors together.  Excellent Chili!

This is AMAZING chili! Made it for a football party and I did not do a test run on the recipe which I always do but I figured all the 5 star reviews couldn’t be wrong and they were not!! I followed everything as written except cooking a batch of bacon and I used it all vs the bacon bits and cooked my veggies in the bacon grease. Everyone raved and is still talking about it! They want me to enter it in our local chili cook off! Thx for the keeper chili recipe!!!

I like the taste of this- particularly how spicy it is, since I like chilis and stews with a kick to them- but I don't think I'll make this very often. It's very heavy on the prep and the ingredients list is massive, which makes it a little more expensive and time-consuming to make than I prefer. The reward for both of those things, of course, is that if you follow the amounts in the recipe exactly, you can feed a small army with the amount of food it produces! So that certainly makes it worth it.

This is my go to chili recipe for years.  I've never made it the same twice. Always good reviews. Can tend to be spicy for some of my family, so I've experimented with ways to tone down- usually by adding more veggies in a pinch.  
Recipe barely fits in our average size crock pot, so heads up its  a full pot.  (I don't always use crockpot- works well stove top too. )

I made this according to the recipe. I used a Poblano and Anaheim pepper for the green chile peppers and Guinness for the beer and cooked it on low in a slow cooker overnight for about 8 hours. It had a slight kick to it but not too spicy. It's very thick which I like. I might try adding some more cumin and a jalapeno next time but it's delicious just the way it is. I can only imagine it'll be even better tomorrow.

This really is the best chili recipe! To take the heat down a bit for my kiddos I use all mild beans. And I sometimes add in a few cups of elbow macaroni. Delicious!

Made this twice so far. The best chili I’ve ever had. Feel free to experiment with different ratios of ingredients with this one, it will still be tasty. I liked using a higher ratio of sausage to beef. Don’t be shy with the spices. And if you like a sweeter chili, use more sugar than this recipe calls for.

My family did not care for this recipe. It was way too watery and soupy. They prefer a more traditional thicker style of chili. They also prefer more types beans and less meat which really made it far too fattening for what they prefer. I’m sure it is just personal preference and not that it isn’t a good recipe but not our cup of tea.

This is a great, flavorful chili.  Good with cornbread or on a chili dog.  I replaced the beer with a strong ginger ale (like  n bull), liked that better.

This is now go-to chili recipe! You cant really mess it up unless you let it scorch.  It's great with crackers, fritos, cornbread, or all by itself. It's a crowd favorite.

Easy to assemble once you gather all the ingredients. Using a Foodie Ninja in pressure cooker setting, after I browned the beef and sausage I added everything to the bowl and pressure cooked for 37 minutes. Magnificent. 5 stars.

My husband said it was the best chili he had ever eaten.  That's very high praise.  It was just a tad too spicy for me but I added sour cream to my bowl and it was fantastic.  Absolutely loved it.

I did EXACTLY (I mean EXACTLY) as written and it is by far the BEST chili that both my boyfriend or I have ever had. There are a lot of ingredients but it works! If you rate this bad, you must be a terrible cook or you substituted/left something out.  At that point, don't rate it bad DUH ;)

Delicious. Left out the spicy stuff because my husband and daughter do not like heat. Meat used: 1 lb chopped meat. 1.5 lbs sirloin steak 1 inch cubes and 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage with casing removed. I was out of peppers so I left those out. Very flavorful even without the heat and a big hit!

this is a wonderful recipe.   full of flavor and is relatively easy to make.  I did change two thing one only one jalapeno pepper. I don't care for 2 much heat.  number 2 I did half of the Chili powder I don't care for that  strong flavoring that chili powder gives.

This is hands down the chili winner in our house. A 1/4 cup of chili powder is waaaay too much so I do 2 Tlb.  We also skip the peppers as they are not loved, and it still tastes great. I often substitute turkey for the beef and we have started simmering it on our Traeger smoker -225 for 3-4 hours over mesquite. Amazing.

I just won a chili cookoff competition with this recipe! It’s excellent! The only thing I did to augment it was added a bunch of red pepper flakes for more heat. Served it with jalapeños, cheese and onions...definitely a winner! My go-to chili recipe from now on; worth the time and effort!

This is great. I put less bean in it but it makes a great hit for football game watching.

I thought this chili was ok but for the work involved and long ingredient list, the flavor was very overwhelmingly "canned". It tastes pretty much like an only slightly upgraded can of chili like Hormel.

This is our favorite chilli. I added one tbsp if Hershey’s cocoa, dropped the sugar and used brown sugar Splenda, used chicken broth instead of water and increased paprika to two tbsp and used sweet paprika instead of regular.

followed closely but reduced heat some. I didn't get the "wow" flavor I expected after reading the glowing reviews. It's really good, my chili-picky son liked and we all agree that it's better than my usual go-to recipe. I will likely make again, but I will keep looking for the one that wows my son's socks off.

Outstanding!!! Its the best chili I've ever made, but a word of advice  -  a regular dutch oven is nowhere near big enough. An 8 quart stockpot or larger is needed. But don't worry about making more than you can eat, it freezes well.

This is such a fantastic chili, I’ve been making this recipe for years. This is such a fun recipe to make it your own a little bit. I have used dozens of different beers to make this from stouts, to lagers, fancy craft beers, and everything in between and I have found like a classic Budweiser makes it taste the best.

I don't eat red meat or sausage very often so I swapped out ground turkey for all of the meat in this recipe, did not put celery in here, added a can of corn. It was a major hit.

SO GOOD. I have made this as written, used diced steak, and even substituted turkey for the meats (on separate occasions) and it's just an all around great chili - you can't go wrong with any meat substitution!

I've been using this as a base for years, so I'll give it credit as an origin. It's very flexible. I like to add more fresh ingredients, so I up the produce, use a whole rainbow of bell peppers, and sometimes add a cup or so of frozen corn after it rests to get it cool enough to store in the fridge. I use a smaller amount of *roasted* diced tomatoes instead of 56 oz of plain canned, and instead of all 4 cans of chili beans I mix it up and use chili, black and kidney. I think it ramps up the color, texture and taste. I never have bacon bits but they're not necessary by the time everything else is added in. I pack it so full that I usually just use two pounds of meat, like ground italian turkey and ground italian pork. I've also swapped meat for a can of garbanzo beans and/or vegan crumbles for vegetarians. My company held a chili cook-off and I made a variant of this just as an excuse to make dinner without a ton of leftovers, and the head of our company picked mine (an older Texan couple; as a Texan myself, I like rejecting the idea that chili has to be limited to meat soup). Feel free to experiment and toss in a bit of flavor sitting in your fridge (mustard, bbq sauce, you name it).

I leave out the beer, sausage, and hot ingredients.  I use a pound of lean (97% fat free) ground beef and a pound of lean turkey so that I don't have to deal with pouring off any grease.  I use three kinds of mild chili and kidney beans for color.  I do not drain off the canned bean or tomato juice. Red, green, and yellow bell pepper also give nice color to the chili.  Very easy to make.  Ready to eat after a full boil for 30 minutes.  Tastes best with a dallop (tablespoon) of sour cream on top of each bowl.  Taste great over a baked potato or as a chili cheese dog.

Used 8 servings. Substitute ground beef for venison. Only used chili beans no ranch beans available. Put in a nice dive squirt of ranch dressing. Added half a can of corn. Used smoked paprika. Added 1 tbs of red wine vinegar. Franks extra hot as hot sauce. Very good.

I won our chili cook off at work against about ten other entries using this. I left some things out because I didn't have them or didn't care to put them in. 
So, no beer, Worcestershire, basil, celery, red pepper. corn chips, or cheese went into mine. 
Also, I used thick cut applewood smoked bacon, and chipotle Tabasco vs regular. 
Loved it, will definitely make it again!

This chili was great! I added stew beef chunks to the ground beef and Italian sausage. I didn’t add the hot sauce and I’m thankful I didn’t. It had a kick to it. I also used about 1/4 a small can of mild chili’s instead of chopping my own. I don’t like green bell peppers so I didn’t add this either. It was delicious.

I made this recipe as close as possible to the original because I made it for 8 instead of 12. I used the calculater in Allrecipes. The directions and the reviews refer to sugar but it's not listed in the ingredients. I always add sugar to my tomato sauces to eliminate the bitter taste. I only added 2 tsp. but may need more. It's on the stove now...we'll see how it turns out!

Oh my gosh!  This is my new recipe for chili!  Chock full of meat, beans, tomatoes.  The right heat that is at the back of the throat rather than the tongue. I make just a few changes but is basically the same.  Awesome. Highly recommend!

VERY VERY spicy and we like spicy stuff, but this is a little too extreme. I hardly get heartburn and man this did me in and my husband was literally sweating from how hot it was. We even added sour cream, but didn’t help much. We followed the recipe exactly except we didn’t add jalapeño peppers and I’m glad we didn’t or it would’ve been worse. I would say if you like spicy stuff, but want more flavor instead of burning your nose hairs off, just do all mild beans instead of one can of hot beans because that’s the only thing I can think that overdid it. I used one can of the Meijer brand hot & spicy beans. I’ve definitely had better chili, surprised it has such a high rating.

There are so many ways to make chili, but this has to be near top of list! A half recipe is plenty for us. The italian sausage (sweet) added wonderful flavor, and it's especially great the next day. I avoided adding the cayenne pepper and other heat (I did add some poblano pepper for the flavor) since my wife can't take the spice, but I will add a bit next time. I plan to use this for a chili cook-off coming up.

Delicious on the first night - can't wait for day #2! 

Some of my changes: 
I used Murphy's Stout and added my special ingredients (cinnamon & a pinch of brown sugar) for a little sweetness to compliment the smoky savory of the beer.

Perfect chili in my mind.  I'm not front Texas, and don't care how Texas people make chili.  This chili is great for hot tamales, Petros, or whatever you want to put it on.  I don't think it would be great for hot dogs and things like that with all the beans, and in that situation I'll take a no bean chili sauce.  I'll definitely be making this one again in a double batch and freezing it.

Very forgiving and delicious recipe that you can make with mostly pantry ingredients.  Sometimes I don't have all the ingredients and it still turns out great.  I rarely add the celery and bacon bits as I don't have them on hand and it is still very good.  I usually make this in the crockpot and let it cook all day.   I also like to saute the onions and peppers in the leftover sausage grease to get a little more flavor on them.

I used a locally made hot pork country sausage in mine. It was really, really good! I made a mistake of letting it simmer too long and my veggies lost their crispness but the chilli was still good. I should have stopped after the first 2 hour taste test because it was the best chilli I had ever tasted at that point.

The recipe is amazing! Thank you for sharing with the world!
I made one minor adjustment.  I substituted the ground beef with pulled beef.  I wanted to use brisket but didn't have that much time so I put a chuck roast in the oven and then shredded it.   My husband and and friends wouldn't stop commenting on how amazing the chili was ....best recipe so far and I've have tried a LOT!   Thanks again!  I've deleted all other recipes in my files and this is now my go to!  You Rock!

I really enjoy this recipe, but tweak it slightly.  I saute the vegetables in some bacon grease from the cooked bacon to give it more flavor, and add the spices & bacon in to the meat & veggie mixture before adding all of the beans, tomatoes, etc.

MAKE THIS CHILI ALREADY!! I did make some changes as other reviewers suggested and some of my own. I used what we had on hand. Instead of ground beef we had ground venison so we used that and one pound cubed stew meat with the Italian sausage. After two hours the cubed meat was still fairly tough. I don't know if 6 more hours in the slow cooker will make it tender but tomorrow I'll remove from pot into slow cooker and cool some more. I used 4 slices of bacon, not bacon bits. 1 16 oz can chili beans with mild sauce and 1 with medium sauce. I don't care for beans so that's all I added but another can of beans probably would have been good. I used 3 cans diced regular tomatoes and 1 diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil. I omitted the celery as hubby doesn't like it. I substituted 1 jalapeno instead of the two green chilies. I used one whole can of Lonestar beer. I omitted the hot sauce and used brown sugar instead of white. We served with cornbread. It was pretty spicy still so glad I didn't add the extra heat. Best chili I've ever had and I used to judge chili cook offs.

I made this yesterday, 10/11/19, for a community party and Chili cooking contest.

The recipe not only created an excellent chili but won 1'st Place in the competition.

The chili recipe was easy to make and will be my go to chili recipe.

The flavor of this chili is delicious, but I really like to have multiple types of beans for interest. I used chili beans, but I also used garbanzo, spicy black beans, and cannellini beans. I also used habanero hot sauce. Very delicious!

This isn't intended to be the world's best, most costly and finest ingredient chili. This is tailgate chili, quick and delicious. You can get creative with it... I laid Tangerine Peppers (from this site) atop the chili... which produced an excellent combination. I also added a dollop of guacamole and sour cream Heartily recommended.

I make this chili every year, I have celiac disease and it's extremely easy to make this gluten free and you can make this mild and others can add some heat to their bowl if desired! Serve it with cheese and sour cream over Fritos, yum!

Won our chili cook off two years in a row. It's a favorite around the house in the cold months! A lot of ingredients that meld together well and just enough kick to give you a sniffle.

Simple and easy to find ingredients. I cut the servings down to 10. I included a few adaptations: 
1. Omit bell peppers (we just don't like them in my house) 
2. Used small can of diced chipotle peppers 
3. One can of Rotel with green chilies 
4. 1 lb. ground sirloin, 1 lb. Italian sausage, 1/2 lb. chorizo
5. Beer choice - Shiner Bock

I'll make it again. I used grass fed beef and skipped the sausage because I forgot it. I replaced the plain chili beans with butter beans. Very good flavor! Can't even taste the bacon. (Which I'm happy about.) This will be our go to and I will play with it!

Great recipe!  Seasoning is perfect!  I made it hotter by using Hatch peppers, green chili peppers and Ro-Tel and eliminated the green peppers.   I also used stew meat and hot Italian sausage.  The plan was to make it on Thursday and re-heat it on Friday.  We couldn't resist!  Had 2 bowls full and so did my fiancé.  I lived in Texas and made Texas chili, this is far better!

Guilty of making changes to suit our tastes. 
Left all chopped goods out. Only used 3 cans of beans. one can of light kidney and one can of dark kidney and one spicy chili bean.  Preferred diced tomatoes with green chili in them. 
Only 8 for dinner and no leftovers.  Will definitely make again

Not all "5 star" recipes are, but this one?  Oh my gosh, phenomenal!!!!  The recipe called for 1/4c. chili powder.  Only change I made was combining equal parts of regular grocery store chili powder with chipotle powder and ancho chili powder to comprise the 1/4c.

Our family has made chili for years, but never by a recipe, so I went online to find one as close as possible to finally get something on paper and learn some improvements, which I most certainly did with this recipe. I made some changes like omitting the beer, using chopped beef and pork instead of ground, and using kidney beans instead of chili beans. We don't like things quite that hot. Came out great and it gets even better the next day.

I cooked this in a Crock Pot for 6 hours with what I had on hand (e.g. San Marzano Tomatoes, canned Black Beans, Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, Jimmy Nardello pepper from the garden, bone broth, brown sugar). After 2 hours I tasted and for fun threw in stuff that seemed useful that I had on hand (garlic, cocoa powder, fresh salsa, panko bread crumbs, brandy). I think that is the best way to make chili. It will never taste the same twice though.

Best chili ever! It is really good how it is written, but I change it because of fussy eaters. I don’t add celery and I don’t add any beans. It’s still the best chili I’ve ever had. Also, this way there is more broth, and I love broth. My whole family loves it!

I have made this chili at least a dozen times. I don’t always follow the recipe to a T- but I ALWAYS use it as my grocery list/base recipe. There are a few things I always do differently- I add kidney beans, I use several different cans of tomatoes for all of the flavors (roasted, garlic added, habanero added etc.), I replace the celery with carrots (trust me, it’s amazing), and I add jalapeños. Sometimes when I don’t have bouillon cubes I use beef stock which actually comes in handy because I like to slow cook this chili for 10-14 hours. This time I added fresh minced garlic and some roasted whole garlic cloves I bought from Whole Foods. I used to make several different recipes for my chili but my husband says this one is the winner.

Great chill!  The only thing that I would say bad about this is it is way over the top on hot spice.  I backed off on the hot spice and it was very close to the top of my hot meter.  If you look at this.  Think HOT!

I made this for camping trip with 6 people, 4 of whom were young, hungry men. Used some leftover spicy bloody mary mix I had in the fridge, as well as some mushrooms, but otherwise followed this recipe exactly. Amazing hit, every bit eaten up, with complements all around! Definitely making it again.

I made the recipe with a couple changes. I didn’t add red and green bell peppers and jalapeño peppers. I also replaced the onion with onion flakes. It tasted soooo good! Not too spicy!

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of chili, but I needed a recipe for a chili cookoff.  I substituted one pound of chicken Italian sausage for one pound of ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely.  I not only really enjoyed it, but I one first prize!  Thank you!

This is good.  Be careful with the spices if you are sensitive.  I ended up having to add more beans and tomato product to calm them down, and I like spicy food.  Makes a huge batch that you can use for quick meals all week.

A great chili as is, but of course, there's always that one person who must do it 'their' way.
I'm not a fan of canned anything, so did the beans the day before in the slow cooker.
For the Diy Crowd:
     If you have fresh herbs, hot peppers and garlic - try Sarah's Chili Seasoning Mix by Sarah Dipity, 3 Tbsp fresh oregano (or to taste) 3 tsp fresh Basil,  the Homemade Worcestershire Sauce by mlally, fresh garlic from the garden, or in the spring - garlic scapes.
     I will post a homemade Cayenne hot sauce recipe and Chipotle hot sauce recipe  (both very easy)
Do you can your own tomatoes and tomato paste? we make over 100 jars of canned tomatoes each year, and  use the tomato machine, and process and freeze paste, so if you got it use it.
A lot of work to make, but for the truly homemade crowd...... why use canned?
If you have the time and a dehydrator, make your own paprika..... so easy.
Family amazed at the work we put into homemade, but why not?
Thank You MIGHTYPURDUE22 - great recipe!

Made this recipe exactly as instructed and it was a huge hit with the family.  Makes a VERY large pot of chili though.  For a family of 3 I should have thought it out better, but we found a way to use it up. (Chili Cheese Dogs the next night)

I followed the recipe very closely. added one more chopped onion. Perhaps put in just a tad more hot sauce. I substituted frozen peppers that I sautéed after microwaving with the onions and the added minced garlic. After it simmered a couple of hours, I have to say I needed to add NOTHING! The spiciness was just perfect. not too hot, not too mild. I did not drain the chili beans. Its a great recipe. I will surely make this from now on.

This is a great chili base to go from, which is what I did, I love big bold flavors and this is the perfect recipe to go with to make that happen. So I Frankensteined this recipe and made it essentially into a 4 meat chili. I used swanson beef broth instead of bullion as I find it too salty,  ground chuck as in the recipe, omitted the italian sausage for Breakfast sausage, added some thick chopped Linguica sausage, omitted beans in the recipe for black and white beans, added a serrano chile on top of the jalapeno instead of the tabasco, and will be adding a nice Firestone Walker- Easy Jack IPA.

What an outstanding recipe.  Though it has many ingredients, it is quite easy to make.  If you have patience and follow the recipe it is quite enjoyable.  I will definitely make it again.

Amazing! I have made this recipe several time without the beans (husband does not like them). Only changes were to add full bottle of "hoppy beer, add 1 tablespoon of chipotle pepper seasoning, 4 slices bacon (hickory-not sugared) and smoked salt! Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow!  This had great flavor.  I didn’t use the bacon bits or the tobasco because I didn’t have them, and I didn’t use spicy beans because I was afraid it had too much Hot in it, but other than that I made it exactly and it was delicious!  It makes a lot of food.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This is hands down my favorite chili recipe and is the only one I make now. So glad I found this.  It is delicious exactly as is and just as good if you remove some of the spicy ingredients or modify it a little.

Yes, it's a staple.  I don't include the hot chili peppers and I put in a can of kidney beans and a can of baked beans.  I also use crushed tomatoes.

This is the only chili recipe I use. I LOVE IT!  I have made it exactly as written, and also with my own modifications- you really can't go wrong. Turkey instead of ground beef still keeps it a winner. I have yet to replace the Italian sausage... because why would I.... but I may try just to see if I can squeak out the healthiest version possible and still keep it fantastic.

Lots of ingredients but so worth the effort.  Much better than the prepackaged mix.  I reduced the cayenne to lower heat sensation.

This is my go-to chili recipe and it is fantastic. it has just the right amount of kick to it. I use 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground pork like chorizo, and 1 lb turkey. After cooking the meat, dump it in a strainer to get the grease out and then return it to the dutch oven. I don't put the bacon bits in. I don't think it adds anything to the flavor and is kind of a junky product. 
You can't go wrong with this chili.

Overall: Loved this recipe. It had a kick of spiciness, but it wasn't overpowering.

Alterations: I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, which added some prep time to the recipe.

Recommendations: I recommend chopping up all the ingredients as the first step of the recipe.

I modified this with smoked brisket instead of ground beef, kept the Italian sausage and used red, yellow and orange bell peppers. (I don’t care for green.) I also added 1 can of diced pineapple. DElicious!!!!!!

I just use a chili seasoning packet to make it a bit quicker, and I leave out the chili powder because my kids don't like spice.  Such a good recipe.   Bonus - Kids love it!

Still in her crockpot and won’t be ready until tomorrow but I made it exactly as the recipe called for but added a full bottle of beer. Tried it a bit early and it feels like it could use either more cayenne or Tabasco I used tapatio but idk what others are saying by its too spicy

I didn't use a few of the ingredients (beer, bacon, sugar, paprika-didn't have any more, beef bouillon).  There were so many it was easy to skip a few.  It was the best chili I ever made.  My wife later called and exclaimed how good it was.  She said, "...and if I sound surprised about how good it is, it's because I am!"  I look forward to making it again.

This tastes SO GOOD! Sweet and smoky. I did not add the spicy peppers, and was out of basil. I used smoked paprika. Also, I sautéed the green and red peppers with half a pear (skinned and finely diced) To reduce their acidity and increase digestibility. I never thought I would give up my old recipe, but this is so delicious! Are used smoked paprika.

I made a couple of changes.  My family doesn't cook with beer or wine, so I used 1/2 cup of beef broth and instead of cutting up green chilies I used two small cans of chopped green chilies. Everything else was the same.  I entered it into a chili cook-off at work and won 2nd place!!!  I would add more heat to it next time.  Great flavor though.  I will definitely make it again!

Unless you have a really big stock pot - I recommend breaking the recipe in half - or simply start with 2 pots.  Might need a little sour cream to dab on after to chill out the kick - for those who don't like anything too spicy.  I didn't think it was spicy - but others did.

I’ve never made chili before this recipe... may family is super picky and all said this is their all time favorite chili! I make it at least once a month! Only thing I change is that I don’t exactly measure hot sauce or seasoning... just kind of dump them in!

This was a great recipe. I did change a few things. I used  4- 14oz cans of diced tomatoes (3-fire roasted and 1-garlic and basil), used 1 can of green chilies instead, 3 cans of chili beans undrained and 1 can of kidney beans drained, a 2.5oz pack of bacon piece, added 1 jalapeño without seeds, and  3 small cans of tomato paste. This is my new go to chili and everyone loved it!

I only had 1 pound ground beef so I exchanged the other pound with ground turkey.  I also used a little bit less hot spices.   It still was excellent.

This was awesome!!! I made it with and without the Italian sausage, it's good both ways, so if you wanna save money it will still be good if you omit it. I only added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 chili pepper, if you don't like it hot, omit the chili pepper, the hot sauce will do it. I've made it with canned beans and fresh kidney beans, it's good either way, but I preferred the fresh beans. I basically stuck to the recipe other than that except my Frito's were Chili Cheese. I also put a dab of sour cream in my bowl to tone down the spicy flavor. IT IS A KEEPER everyone loves it!!! Thanks for the recipe

I mix it up using different beans and different cuts of pork and beef. So far it has never failed the critics (the other guys and gals). I mainly stick with the spices but will add a corrot or two to temper the heat , either sliced or shredded. Don't forget the chives, shredded cheese and sour cream as the last garnish topping.??????.

I've made this recipe multiple times.  It's incredibly delicious and a family favorite.  Make it a day ahead of time and let it sit overnight in the fridge, then reheat the next day for the best flavor!

Chili turned out well. I made a few edits based on my go-to chili recipe. I added two cans of artichoke hearts that were cut up, half a jar of capers which helped the salty taste, and added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar. All turned out well.

This was a fantastic chili! I made mine too spicy by swapping out jalapenos for the  green chile peppers. So be aware of the cayenne pepper that goes in. The beer was an amazing addition. I've never added beer to chili so I was weary of the outcome, but it was phenomenal!!

This was my first time making chili and after reading the reviews I had to give it a shot. I followed the directions with the exception of 2 items, I left out the cayenne pepper and the spicy beans. The chili had a nice spice but was not hot. For the bean I used 2 cans of chili pinto beans, 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans. The recipe yields a lot. It easily feeds 10-12 with extra helpings for all. I made a double batch for 20 people and had plenty to send home with a couple of guests and I have lunch for a couple days. I cooked this on low for  a total of about 8 hours. I've found my forever chili recipe.

My plan was to make this per the recipe, but I was missing a few items, so made it without sausage and beer, but it's such a great recipe that it was still the best chili I've made! I did add sliced black olives & liked them in it, and next time I will try it with the beer. Great recipe!

I've made and tasted many chilies. This is the best, most flavor-packed, texturally wonderful, chili I've ever had. The only thing I added the second time I made it was two bay leaves and a large grana Padano cheese rind. I adjusted the heat for our taste because we prefer it a bit spicier. This is outstanding chili. A dish of delish!! Thanks for posting it!

I do this in a slow cooker, start off the first 2 hours on HIGH, stir really good, the switch to LOW for another 10 hours. This started off as a Super Bowl dish, but is always requested at any function. The main change I made are with the beans.  I’ve always used Bush’s steakhouse recipe grilling beans instead of the chili beans.

I've been making this recipe for years now! The only thing I do not add is bell peppers.  We love it!  I also think making this a day ahead is the way to do it and just reheat in a crockpot.  Perfect for parties!

I did not include the green pepper or green chiles but it did not seem to matter. My wife, who is not a fan of spice loved it! Left the hot sauce out on the side for those who wanted to add it if they wanted. I would definitely make this again.

This was absolutely fantastic. Though some may not like the cumin flavor of the chili, but to me it gives it a nice flavor. I also used smoked paprkia to give it a little flare, and instead of two chili peppers I used one jalapeno. Sauteed all the vegitables and drained before adding it to the meat and probably added 1/2 a cup of beer for flavor.  The beer choice will change the flavor just slightly.

I’ve made this recipe several times. As directed, it is 5 stars. However, I do make a few changes out of convenience that I don’t think lower the rating! I leave out the celery and bacon bits because I never have those on hand. I don’t even notice they’re missing. Additionally, I usually don’t let it simmer the full amount of time (impatience), and it turns out great anyway. Freezes really, really well! I almost always have a bag or two in my freezer for a quick homemade meal.

My whole family loved this chili! Because I have 2 young kids I didn't make it spicy.  My husband added his own hot sauce.  A meaty chili (as opposed to a soupy chili) this is what my husband prefers.  Soooo good!!!

This chili definitely improves over time. Won 3rd place in a chili cook-off on day 2.  I think it was even better on day 3!  I liked the heat, but it was a little too spicy for some of the judges with my changes (used hot Italian sausage and omitted spicy beans and Tabasco).

I have won the last 3 chili cook offs with this recipe. It’s so awesome. Nothing overpowers anything else and it just tastes how chili is supposed to taste.

This is now my go to chili recipe.  Modified to our taste...used only 2 cans of beans, no green pepper and mostly fresh spices from my herb garden.  A bit too thick, so next time will add more broth.  Experiment and enjoy!!!

This has been my go-to chili recipe for years so thank you to the poster for posting it. The thing I love about this recipe is the number of ingredients and the versatility of the recipe.  Because it has so many ingredients, it doesn't suffer if you are missing some. I have made this in many variations depending on what I have in the kitchen. My family doesn't like green and red peppers so I leave those out.  I only include the beer if I have something crappy someone brought over.  Sometimes I add a can of corn.  I usually use a little more cumin than called for, and sometimes I add a little heat with jalapeño peppers....
Overall this is an amazing basis for killer chili.

I love this recipe.  I was generous with the sausage and used hamburger instead of ground Chuck.  Made in the croc pot and split between two as it needs larger than a 6QT to fit it all.  It was even better the next day!

This chili came out really good. My only critique is that I like spicy chili so I think next time I would do 3 cans of chili beans in medium sauce and throw a couple of jalapeños in it.

Excellent recipe! An elaborate combination of meats, beans, veggies, spices, and herbs blend together to produce a delectably-flavored chili. My husband loved this recipe and I will definitely make again.

This chili was superb! Made a couple adjustments to the hot stuff to be added in due to family members with weenie mouths but it was a hit! Doctored my own bowl with my stash of hot sauces and it was perfect! I used a orange and a yellow bell pepper and added a heaping spoonful of brown sugar as well. 10/10 will make again! Side Note- I am still a Hoosier fan

This is my go to recipe for chili for a crowd.  My biggest change is doing this in the crockpot. I usually start preparing it the night before, while I'm cooking dinner.... throw it all in the crockpot overnight.  It really does get better made ahead. I saute the meat separately, then also saute 4 pieces of bacon (instead of bacon bits).  Add the beans at the end.  Also, my kids are whiney about spicey food, so substitute the hot things to your taste.  I use one or two serrano chiles depending on size, chili powder as noted, and then let people put their own pepper sauce in  after.

This is our absolute favorite recipe for chili! Tonight I made it in the instant pot and it turned out even better than before!!! I grew up eating macaroni noodles in my chili (goolash) and was craving some on this cold wet day so I made a small batch of noodles for myself and it definitely did not disappoint!! Better than mom's,  but don't tell her that!

I think this may be the best chili I’ve ever made. We substituted the ground beef with just 1 pound of ground turkey. We did add the sausage. Really amazing chili!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I decided to make it because of all of the great reviews.   I thought it was a little too spicy and just not that great. I ate it but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.   I would say it was ok and not worth the time and all of the ingredients.  This recipe makes a ton of chili!  Make sure you have a big pot!

I have made this recipe at least 10 times, brought it in for work luncheons. The only thing I do consistently is use a full can of dark beer like Guinness or yuengling and eliminate all hot/spicy items. Great recipe!

I make this every year for Patriots playoffs and Super Bowl parties. Serves lots of folks. Has a little kick to it but not too much. I mixed up the beans using chili, kidney and pinto. I highly recommend.

Hi there, no offense but I'm really not sure how this has gotten so many 5 star reviews. I'm really not a fan of my wife's chili. I finally talked her into trying a new recipe. I will be totally honest. This is one of the only recipes I've ever followed to the measurements. I've got to say, it's kinda a chili cop out. Ya, it's stupidly simple but very bland. Thanks, but no. Yes, when I find the family recipe I will definitely share. This chili had some good taste, no spice. Thanks for sharing.

I have been making this chili for years, and we have a preference for a meatier chili so here are my adjustments. I use two packages (usually about 1 1/2 pound each) of stew meat beef that I then cut into smaller cubes, still add a pound of ground hamburger, and I find it easier to just use a 1 pound package of ground Italian sausage. I use 2 cans of chili beans in regular/mild sauce and then 2 cans of chili beans in spicy sauce. I have made it with three before but that’s incredibly spicy, and although we do love spicy food that was a little too spicy for most people so we do half and half. I do cheat on the green chili’s by adding a small can of Ortega or old paso diced green chilis. Other than that I follow the recipe to the letter. I will say they are right about simmering it for hours. I generally start at 11:30 in the morning putting it together and start simmering it around 12-12:30 and let it simmer on low heat until 5-5:30 for dinner. It’s great reheated but be prepared this is a large recipe I give half of it away.

This is my favorite chili recipe by far! I tweak it here and there, mostly with the type of peppers I use (habanero yum yum) and no celery.

This is the best chili recipe ever - at least to me and my family. I made a huge pot for our annual holiday party. There was none left. Luckily my husband set some aside for us. Delicious. My husband doesn't eat a lot of beef so I subbed in turkey and it still turned out delicious. Hats off to the originator of this recipe.

It was great and ... way better than my husband's "chili soup". ;)  I did follow a couple suggestions from the other comments but this recipe in itself was very tasty.  We have made it 3 times already and everyone who has tried it liked it.  It makes A LOT of chili though!

I did make a couple of minor changes, but on the whole made as written and was absolutely blown away by how good this is! It's a bit time consuming, but so worth it! I've made it many times now, and it's the preferred recipe for our chili cravings

Really enjoyed this recipe!  I thought it could use more beans, veg, and spices though.  I increased the veg and spices to my liking.  Substituted the beer for home made beef stock and cut out the bacon.  (too much salt / fat!)

I made it as is with high hopes because of the ratings. This was one of those chili’s that if you can’t make it good, hide it by making it spicy.

Excellent starting recipe with little mods for the household.  I do a leftover Christmas prime rib chili recipe every year and decided to change from the norm for this batch.  The family has voted this one the best.  These were my mods to this...
Used a 6 quart Insta-Pot.  Browned the Sausage on Saute and removed.  Sauted all the vegetables with the garlic (used a couple of big Anaheims as the green chilis (not roasted just sauted).  Add the remaining ingredients on slow cook high for an hour.  Recipe mods - 3 cans of chili beans with sauce, 1 can 28 oz of diced tomatoes.  Reduce beef bouillon to 2 cubes. Delete celery.  Up the cumin amount by taste (I used 1.5 TBSP).  Substitute 1/4 cup light brown sugar for the white sugar.  Add back the sausage and cubed prime rib and set on medium slow cook for 6 hours.  Stir every hour (and taste of course :) ).

I made it basically the same but toned down the peppers, because my family loves the flavor but not the spice.

Great recipe. Has the perfect amount of spicy heat. It makes a though (my pot was full to the rim). I plan to half it next time I make it but other than that I would not change a thing.

This is what I call real chili.  It is very delicious, but it was a little spicy for some of my guest.  Next time around I reduced the Chili items.  It was still very good!

Outstanding chili!

We make this with a large crock pot and it does not all fit. We have to reduce the amount of meat by one pound, and omit one can of beans so that everything will fit. We also don't use a full quarter cup of chili powder because it is too spicy for our taste. Overall, absolutely fantastic!

This is hands down the best chili I’ve ever eaten!!! Usually, I improvise quite a bit when I’m cooking  but in this case I followed the recipe exactly (with the singular exception of using lots of extra hot peppers) and the results were astounding. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!

This is a very good recipe.  I have family that hates hot stuff.  So I had to change a few ingredients.  Everything was added but the chilies.  Cut the chili powder in half.  Used turkey instead of pork Turned out great.  I will make this again..  Thanks for sharing this recipe

Hello from Texas!  We know our chili.  This is a great twist on combining several types of chili into one bowl.  I've had sausage chili, beer chili, bacon added chili, spicy chili and so on.  This recipe nicely blends these types of chili into one.  I only made 5 small changes, 2 out of necessity.  For beans: (2 cans) BUSH'S Kidney Beans in a Mild Chili Sauce and (2 cans) BUSH'S Pinto Beans in a Hot Chili Sauce.  I like the look and taste of kidney beans in my chili. I am not fond of how strong tomato paste can be in a chili, I switched it for a standard can of tomato sauce. Added 1 cup of Shiner Bock instead of 1/2 of a cup.  My supermarket was out of fresh Chili peppers so I subbed a 7 oz. can of Chopped Diced Green Chilies, Fire Roasted and Peeled, Medium spicy. My final change was a goof on my part.  I did only 1# of ground beef instead of 2#.  Came out just fine, but I will be adding in that 2nd # next time.  In my opinion one ingredient above all else must be of good quality, the chili powder.  It changes the entire taste.  McCormick Gourmet Collection Chili Powder is really good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

An excellent chili. Better when you cook it slow all day. Good as is. Alternatively, a good stating off point for future customization.

This chili was amazing. It may look like there are a lot of ingredients but it is well worth the extra few minutes. I doubled the recipe with the following changes.
Our family doesn't love beans, so when I doubled the recipe I used a total of 6 cans of beans, two cans in spicy sauce and 4 cans in the regular sauce. In addition, instead of doubling the ground chuck and Italian sausage, I used a 3-pound pot roast that I shredded once cooked through. Having the different meat textures was a great addition and I would definitely add that again. The chili gave a nice kick without it being too hot for the younger children. I will definitely make this again!

I've already won two chili contests.  Used beef broth instead of beer since they were for kids school and church.  Amazing.

The city I work for has an annual chili cook-off which doubles as a charity fundraiser.  Every year the fire department wins...until I entered this chili!  The only change I made was to add extra cayenne and a dash of hot sauce and it was a huge hit!  I still get asked for the recipe and that was 4 years ago.

Made this exactly as is and it is an all around great chili. Personally, I’d like it spicier, but I think this is the right balance of spice for a chili everyone can enjoy.

Loved the flavors!  I sauted the onions and peppers and then added them into the chili.  I used canned green chiles and did not add the celery.  I also did not add the beer or a substitute for beer and it still tasted amazing!

I made this on a boy scout campout in a crock pot.  FANTASTIC!   I adjusted (unavoidably) the cook time to 4 hours and I added some roux at the end to thicken as I added too much liquid up front as I did not account for how much the veggies and meat would yield.   I had to skip the beer, as it was a Scouting activity.   Nobody missed that!

Good chili! It’s a little spicy but definitely not over spicy. After I made it, I did not like it. I thought it tasted weird. But the next day I heated it back up and Wah-Lah! It was magically delicious! I got lots of compliments on it. ??

I don't normally make chili, that's my wife's job.  I do the baking, she does the cooking.  But this recipe interested me so I decided to try it out.  The first thing my wife said (as I was browning the italian sausage) was "You don't use italian sausage in chili!"  Etc., etc., to the point where I was regretting haven ever undertaken the task.  This went on until she got tired of telling me how everything I was doing was wrong.  Until she tasted the finished product.  Very humbly, she informed me that it was the best chili she had ever eaten!  I did kick it up a bit as we both love spicy food.  I used Serrano peppers in place of the milder chili peppers. I almost added Habaneros but decided that might be imprudent.  This is definitely a keeper.

I would definitely make this again. I had switched up the recipe a little bit to my taste buds. I used ground turkey and turkey Italian hot sausage with habanero hot sauce. And my measurements were a little different and I added two cans of corn and sustituted a can of black beans for a can of chili beans.

This recipe also works great in the slow cooker.  After browning the meat, I just toss everything into my slow cooker and leave it on for 4 (high) - 6 (low) hours.

Made this for "coffee hour" after church a couple of Sundays ago. I wasn't there while people were eating, buy my husband said they were scraping the bottom of the Crock Pot, and people are still coming up to me and saying how delicious it was. Am making it again next week for my honors students for our finals day party. Will also be making a vegan version, with veggie broth instead of beef and with veggie crumbles in place of the meats.

Every single time that I make this, everyone raves for more.  I swap out italian pork sausage for chicken sausage (jewish friends), I don't add any beer, and I cut the Tabasco sauce and red pepper flakes (Cayenne) in half.  Most of my crew doesn't like it overly hot.  I also toss in some extra cheddar cubes and sprinkle shredded mexican blend over top for each serving.  Along with some crispy bread, everyone loves it every time and they ask me to make a batch several times per year.

Didn't have spicy chili beans so I used spicy Italian sausage.  No other changes!  Hint:  I put all the spices together the day before.  Next time I make this (which will be soon), I'll chopped the veggies the day before.  This will now be my "GoTo" chili recipe.   Use your largest pot cause it makes a lot!

Only adjustment I made was instead of ground beef I used stew beef, floured and browned in olive oil and butter separately (to medium rare), and put into the chili the last half hour of cooking before it goes into the fridge. And left out the Tabasco too ... Didn't really need that heat, it's plenty tasty without. Won our company chili cookoff with it!

I've made this I don't know how many times now. It's excellent. Like most, I've made some changes - mostly to what I use for the meat and beans, but everything else I leave alone. Sometimes I add finely diced habanero or a couple of jalapenos to help spice it up a bit more. I've experimented with hot italian sausage, beef chunks, and even ground turkey or chicken and this recipe still delivers every time.

Wonderful recipe.  I added a can of pulverized chipotle peppers  for a Smokey taste.  Because  I cant get chilli beans with sauce. 
Not a great selection of peppers so I used canned jalapenos and pulverized them as well
I did use ground venison and pork sausage  
Incredible but BEST the next day and the next day

Was a hit at our new family tradition of "Black Friday Chili".  A nice day after Thanksgiving alternative to leftover turkey.  I adapted the recipe for 12 people, which was the perfect amount for 8 people with a little leftover. For a change, I followed the ingredient amounts to the letter, and one out of the eight guests found the dish had a bit too much heat for their taste.   Next time I will probably add a small can of Chipolte peppers and a bit more cumin.

I smoke this in a Lodge 7 quart Dutch oven on my Big Green Egg smoker with hickory or cherry wood. Everyone loves it and it won our chili cook off two years straight. Enjoy!

I made this recipe with substituting deer meat for the beef.  It came out great.  Everyone who ate it wanted the recipe.  Will definitely be adding this to our book of favorite recipes.

Recipe was great! The only changes I made was using a miz of black beans and kidney beans, 1.5 cups beef broth, no beef bouillon(b/c I didn't have it on hand) and used lean ground turkey instead of ground beef to lighten up the chili.

Hands down the best chili I ever made. I had to tweek a little because my family isn't overly spicy. I didn't have celery, chiles, or hot sauce so I added a can of rotel (mild) with chiles, a tsp. of red pepper flakes, and a can of tomato soup  just to tones down the cayenne and red pepper flakes. I'm telling you, look no further for a chili recipes.  The warmth stays with you for awhile. Perfect fall chili!

This is about the 4th time we've made this and we just love it.  It's hearty, full of veggies, and flavorful too!  It freezes nicely as well so we make double or triple  batches and then freeze large yogurt containers full - great to bring out on a cold, snowy day!!  We make it pretty much 'as is', because as you can see, it's got a lot of different flavors.

My 4th time making this, so I think I should give it a review. This chili is so good, I won’t look for another recipe again. I love it, my husband loves it and so do my kids which says a lot because one is SO picky. Doesn’t touch vegetables with a 10 foot pole, but even though she knows this is full of vegetables she will have seconds and eat leftovers every day until it is gone. Of course we enjoy it topped with cheese and some frito scoops to make it fun! Thanks for a delicious chili staple in my house!

Instead of using the recommended chili beans and Spicy chili beans I used  a can of seasoned Charro style pinto beans and one can of Tex-Mex pinto beans. I eliminated the celery and Jalapeño and substituted it with mini sweet peppers, Also, for my meats I added ground chuck steak, Wow!!!! what a difference with hamburger, ground sausage and ground steak makes!!! Perfect blend!!!!

This chili was delicious! The ingredient list is a tad overwhelming but worth it! Once the meat was cooked, I dumped everything in the crockpot and let it cook for hours.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly except for adding another Tbsp of chili powder.  The flavor was great, but I prefer a bit more soupier chili and thought it needed more liquid.  This time I ran the vegetables through the food processor (added bonus: no picky eaters asking "what's that?") and didn't drain the beans.  To compensate for the extra sodium in the bean liquid, I used Herb-ox salt-free beef bullion.  I still added the extra chili powder.  Perfect!

I thought it was way too spicy (I don't like spicy food), and my husband thought it was just right (he likes spicy).  So that goes to show it's all a matter of taste.  I made it with two jalapenos, and two tsp tabasco.  If I make it again I might cut down to just one jalapeno and one tsp tabasco.  However, those of us ketchup-is-too-spicy folks can tone it down by adding cheese, fritos and sour cream.
It makes a TON of chili.  I have large stock pot, not sure the dimensions but it might be 8 quarts.  It filled almost to the top.  I like that it makes so much, because I plan to freeze it in little portions.
I used two cans of Bushes Chili Beans Red Beans in Medium Sauce and two cans of Bushes Chili Beans Kidney Beans in Mild Sauce.  
The prep didn't bother me.  I does take like 30 ingredients and I felt like I was chopping forever.  But most of the spices are common spices that I will use for other things. Considering how long this chili will last, the prep time was worth it.
Overall, my husband loved it, and I liked it but thought it was too spicy.  But I will probably make it again.

Awesome. We are not fans of super spicy dishes so I toned down the heat quite a bit. I cooked six slices of bacon for the bits & then cooked all the veggies in the drippings substituting a jalapeno for the 2 chili peppers. I only used 2-15oz cans of chili beans in a mild sauce. I used a full 12 oz beer. I did not use any hot pepper sauce and only a pinch of cayenne pepper. I simmered for four hours and let it set in the fridge over night before serving.

Unless you are a vegetarian, this is the perfect base chili recipe. I have been using this recipe for six years. It is excellent for a novice, just follow the directions and check off all the ingredients and you are guaranteed to have a great chili. More often than not, I make it in a crockpot.

Over the past several years I have customized this recipe to my own taste. I no longer eat pork, so I omit the bacon bits and use turkey sausage. I wouldn't recommend using turkey bacon. It tastes fine, but it throws the texture off. I like things spicy, so I add lots of Tabasco and sriracha. I also add mushrooms, black beans, spicy brown mustard and just a pinch of cinnamon. 

I used to make it with bouillon cubes, but now I just drain all canned ingredients really well and add some beef broth in addition to the beer. This recipe has a ton of prep work, but it is absolutely worth it. I have won a couple of chili cookoffs with my modifications and a few marriage proposals (many from complete strangers). 

I definitely recommend it.

Unfortunately had 3 medium (heat) cans of chili beans (bought the wrong ones), so added one regular can as per recipe to make the 4.  Also, after tasting the chili added about 3 tablespoons of Sriracha sauce.  Otherwise made as recipe suggested.  VERY GOOD!  We will have again.

Love making this for tailgating! I substituted ground turkey for the beef this time and taste is still fantastic! I loved the 20 minute cook time in the pressure cooker!

Dropped the celery and beer, swapped the bullion for 8 oz of beef stock. First round was great but a bit mild for my taste, so I kicked up the heat with with a full tablespoon of Carolina reaper hot sauce. Definitely one of my top five favorite recipes.

I made it with less pepper because I didn’t want it too spicy. I also used cider beer as the beer choice. It was delicious

I made this recipe to a t and it didn’t really turn out that spicy. I know a lot of other reviewers were worried about the spiciness and idk why. I tried adding more chili powder but that didn’t really do much. Next time I make this I’m definitely going to try to make it spicier. Maybe add more cayenne pepper, green chili peppers, and jalapeños. It does taste good, I just want it spicier.

This was amazing!!!    I altered it a tad.   I used two cans of beans and I added two cans of drained whole kernel corn to add a little sweetness.  I used a whole can of beer and I cut the cayenne pepper in half.   It was soooooo yummy!!!!    We served it with cheddar cheese and sour cream.

This chili was pretty good, but definitely not worth the long ingredient list.  I expected it to be amazing after all the comments about winning chili cookoffs, but it just seemed okay to me.

I make this ALL the time, it is a family favorite. I don’t use “fake” bacon bits, I cook up 3 or 4 slices of bacon so it is nice and crispy then I cook the veggies in the bacon grease until they are tender and the onions are translucent and I add the garlic for the last minute of the veg sauté. Also I drop the tomato paste on the bottom of the hot pan after I brown the meats and stir it around until it is nice and fragrant then add all the other ingredients. I let it simmer away all day on the stove top low and slow and usually serve it the next day if I can keep my family away from it.

I excluded the onion and chili peppers to appease my children, and substituted onion powder. It was loved by all and now I plan on making this with some scotch bonnets for the annual company chili cook-off.

I loved it and my boyfriend did too! I used chili beens with green pepper, and onion (2 smaller cans) and 2 cans of regular chilli beens , then 1 can of mild beens because I couldn't find the hot, Louisianas hot sauce, chopped up 2 jalapeños to add extra and also sprinkled some on top with cheese and sour cream/greek yogurt.  1 large green chili pepper? (forget what it was really called but its all I could find) chopped. everything else I followed exactly to the recipe and it was great!!

Also couldn't find right sausage so I used Jenny-O's Italian seasoned turkey meat instead (1 lb)

This chili turned out AMAZING!!! Seriously best chili I’ve ever had or made for that matter!! I tweaked it just a tiny tiny bit cause I never follow a recipe exactly as it says haha. Included with the ingredients I added a packet of McCormick Original Chili Seasoning. I also used two cans of the chili beans in mild sauce instead of just one (I like spice) & then only one can of the regular chili beans. I used 2 regular sized cans of the diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz cans and the ones I bought were seasoned in a chili sauce (I believe the cans say “chili ready” or something along those lines.). For the beer I used 3/4 of a can of bud light (yum). For the Tabasco sauce I used Franks Red Hot. I used tomato sauce (6oz) instead of tomato paste. I held the cumin, basil, celery, Fritos, and the sausage (the sausage was only because I forgot to add it to my grocery list but chili still turned out so  good!!). To serve I put it in a single serving sized bowl and topped with about another tbsp of shredded mild cheddar cheese, 1 1/2 tbsp of sour cream, and a few saltine crackers!! My girls who are extremely picky eaters LOVED this chili!! My oldest whom is 19 doesn’t even like chili until she ate this!! I do plan to do this recipe next time adding the sausage and also the Fritos as it calls for but I will do everything else the same. This would be great to make for a Sunday football game gathering!! I will tell you that mine did come out with a spicy kick! Enjoy!

I made this chili in a cast iron pot almost exactly to the recipe with a few changes. We were serving a large group so ingredients were tripled. Fresh ground pork sausage was replaced  with spicy ground linguica  and a small amount of fresh corn was added. Simmered for several hours and the little that was left over after the game tasted even better after a couple days in the refrigerator. The perfect combination of ingredients to create a delicious chili with just enough kick not making it overwhelming. I will be making it again soon

I found this recipe about 7 years ago and have been using it ever since. I have made a few changes like sub black beans, use chicken italian sausage when I'm feeling healthy. I did try to cook in a slow cooker once but the beer didn't cook off enough, this is an all day cold Sunday kinda recipe. I came in 1st place in a chili cook off once and 2nd place in another. This is a great chili recipe as long as you dont mind being in the kitchen for a while. I like to call it my "kitchen therapy"!

Good recipe, makes a ton of chili. A bit on the spicy-hot side so next time, I plan on cutting down the spicy ingredients by half.

This chili took the edge off seeing the Packers lose to the Lions, who suck. I used some chopped filet and pork loin because fiscal responsibility just isn’t for me. And since I feel like I’m a super star chef, I put leeks and shallots in it. #boom

I sautéd the veggies and omitted the celery & all but 1 bell pepper. I also only had ground beef on hand but added a bit of Italian seasoning. I ended up adding a bit more cumin & garlic powder than original recipe called for. Came out great for the first go at it. The kids even ate it without a complaint.

I did an extra onion, doubled the sugar, an extra half pound of beef and a whole beer. I didn’t use tobacco and the chili pepper I used was a red one. I also added two additional tablespoons of garlic. For toppings I did green onion, plain Greek yogurt and shredded white American cheese. With homemade cornbread and Fritos of course! It was a crowd pleaser! I will be making this recipe again!

Along with all these other reviews, chili was amazing but I made some revisions. I used real bacon that I chopped into bits. Used the grease to sauté the vegetables with before mixing with meat. I used Wagyu beef over chuck (fat is flavor). I used a dark Oktoberfest for beer and brown sugar over white sugar. I enhanced the heat at the end using chili powder and red pepper.

I use 2 jalapeño peppers instead of Chile peppers. And a whole bag of real bacon crumbles. I tried making real bacon and crumbling it myself one time and we didn’t like it as much. I also omit the celery...don’t really see the point. And I use petite diced tomatoes because I think it blends better. Franks hot sauce is my favorite to use. Love this chili and so does everyone who tries it!! Makes me proud to be a Boilermaker!!!

I have been making this for the last 8 years.  I change it each time I make it a little.  Different beer and peppers each time.  It is so good.  I have gotten so many compliments and requests to make it over and over.  I go heavier on the chili powder, beer, and hot sauce.

It turned out great! I made it with a few modifications. I’m not a fan of bell peppers so I used a jalapeño pepper instead. I omitted the beef bouillon and added a Tbsp of fresh lemon juice. Cooked it in a slow cooker set on low for 6 hours. Served with grated mexican cheese blend over mashed potatoes. Yummy!

I toned down the spice because of my kids - I used one seeded jalapeño and eliminated the cayenne pepper.  I also used only 2 cans of black beans and substituted brown sugar for white and used a cup of dark beer.  I also added a tablespoon of bbq rub - mine is home made, but any will do.  Very tasty!

Chili turned out well. It was a real hit. Chief foodie in the house said it was a 12/10.

Best chili recipe ever!  I only use 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper - kids don’t love spicy. But I have also made this with just veggies and beans or ground chicken and ground sausage. Always comes out awesome.

Just made this and it's delish!  I omitted the salt and beef cubes.  Cut the hot sauce and hot spices in half. (My kiddos don't like food that is too spicy.)

Used elk meat rather than chuck.  Beer was a double IPA and jalapeños for the pepper.  Also added an ears worth or fresh corn kernels.  End result was fantastic!

I change it up a little, by caramelizing the onions, omitting the peppers, and toning down the spicy a lot. It has become a staple in our house, every Christmas Eve to make this chili. I make it a few times throughout the year, but  at Christmas  I have to make a huge pot.

OMG the best chili I have made or had. Everyone loved it. The only comment was that it didn’t need all the beef. It is great the next day as we got 2 meals out of it.

These two pages of ingredients has won a few chili cook offs for me, and I don't change this recipe too much.  It is wonderful!!  I substitute cooking wine (marsala or red) for the beer, and maybe a little extra garlic, but really, don't mess with perfection.  This chili is a favorite, especially when I use my own plum tomatoes instead of canned, and some of my own peppers.  WooHoo!  Try it.

My family really enjoy having this recipe on occasion. we are a family that doesn't really like it to spicy so i omit the tabasco sauce and cayenne pepper. The only other thing i do not include into my recipe is the beer. I have made this for my bowling league parties and it is a repeat every year. Thanks for a great recipe.

Nice chili, needed a lot of extra spicing-up to bring it to tailgater-standards for me. Rather bland the way it is (kind of like Purdue football!).  Main problem for me was that it just made too much chili for my pot and slow cooker. When MightyPurdue22 says use a large pot, he's not kidding...a giant pot!

Here's what I had to add to bring it up to the proper spice-heat: 2 seeded/chopped jalapeños, 2 extra tsp. cumin, 1/2 extra tsp. ground black pepper, 1 tsp. ground ancho chili pepper, 1 tsp. ground chipotle chili pepper, 1 tsp. ground mustard. I also added 4 slices of chopped, cooked bacon.

This is a good starting point for a chili that is a bit spicier, more SoCal style. Fight On!

Tastes good hot.
Tastes good cold.
Tastes good in the pot 9 days old.

And I'm being completely serious. 
Pro tip: Use Chipotle Tobasco for some smokiness

I love the depth of flavors in this chili.  This is my favorite chili recipe.  I have made it several times, and every time, it all gets eaten, raved about, and requested again.  It is really a great recipe!

Used smoked brisket, a variety of beans, hot sausage and extra bacon. I left out the hot sauce, cayenne,  burger and celery, but added salsa verde.  Was an absolute hit.

Best chili! I used 3lbs of ground chuck instead of using the sausage (many in my family don’t like sausage) and used a fresh poblano pepper as the green chili and only 3 cans of chili beans. Simmered for 2 1/2 hours the night before, refrigerated overnight and simmered again for 2 hours the next day. Flavors continued to marry and meld! Amazing!

I substituted the 2 lbs ground beef with 2 lbs chopped tri-tip and the can of spicy beans with kidney beans. The outcome was fantastic; best chili I have ever made.

So, we have a member of the household that doesn't do well with too much spice, so... One Anaheim Chili, one dried Poblano Chili. instead of 1/4 cup chili powder I used 1/8 cup chili powder and 1/8 cup smoked paprika. Throw a carrot (chopped) into the mix. I served it with molasses cornbread and it was a hit. 2 lbs ground beef and 1 lb mild italian sausage. Instead of bacon bits I rendered some bacon ends and pieces (about 1/4 lb.) down and drained off the grease. I didn't drain the grease from the ground beef and sausage. It gives the product a richer flavor.

As one child put it, this chili’s legendary. I didn’t want to make it too spicy so I didn’t use the chili peppers but I did add one jalapeño, chopped up. I also didn’t use the bacon bits and used chili beans in mild. Other than that, this chili came out delicious. Will definitely make again.

I made this with beef instead of hamburger, and I won the church chili cook-off, a friend used the same recipe (with beef) and won HER church chili cookoff in Texas. Its a pretty darn good chili. I didn't use beer though, I substituted chicken broth.

This was easy to make and fantastic.  It tasted even better the second day.  We froze some and when we had that for dinner a few weeks later it was even better.
I am going to use this recipe for tailgates during football season.

Made this with venison instead of beef for a church chili cook off. Win the non-traditional category and got high praise from one of the priests when I bumped into him later on during the festival.

The best chili recipe--ever!   My family always jokes that I NEVER make the same chili twice (because I usually just throw it together), but I decided to make a pot as the recipe instructs.  And this was great!!!  I have now made it two times and it is a hit!

I for the most part left "as is" except in place of the white sugar I did a pinch of white and a pinch of brown. I also increased the beer and added a splash of balsamic vinegar (yes you read that right! google it, its a thing!)

I would definitely make this again, I made a couple of changes, I’m not a huge fan of kidney or chilli beans so I only used one can. And I cut back a little on the hotness. But the flavor was still outstanding. This was my second time with this recipe and it will be my go to recipe for future chilli nights.

Tried it and swapped out the meat with moose and moose sausage. Although I usually just wing it with chili and generally include most of these ingredients the quantities for spices helped and even my daughter who is trying to like spices food enjoyed it. Served with a corn bread recipe from this site.  Great hearty meal!

Spicy, rich and meaty, and so good!  This recipe has a lot of ingredients to it, but it doesn't take long to throw it all together.  And the end result is a great tasting spicy chili.  This recipe is up there with my top favorite chili recipes.  I didn't have sausage, so I left it out, but it would of been great in it.  I also didn't have any beer to use up, so I just added in water for the liquid.  I doubled the garlic and worchestershire sauce, and waited til the end to add the beans.  For the beans, I added 1 less can than stated, and used regular kidney beans.  I cut the serving size down to 6 to make a smaller batch for us, and it was almost eaten all up with just the two of us.  This chili is more on the meaty side and not real saucy like we normally have our chili.  But it is perfect with the toppings added.  Along with the shredded cheese and corn chips, I also garnished with a dollop of sour cream.  So good!  This had the perfect spice level for me, but it was too much for my hubby.  So next time I may have to cut down on the cayenne and chile's for him.  I will for sure be making this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I won the chili cookoff at my job. I used deer/hog for my hambuger. No, Sugar and no extra salt.  I used 3 cans of beans all mild, 2 of them were kidney beans and one was black beans. I used jalapeno instead of bacon bits. Low salt worchestershire, no tabasco. This is the best recipe ever, everybody loved it.

I made this to take to our local homeless day shelter for their noon meal on a wet and windy day. It was a big hit! Its not my idea of authentic chili, but it was great for feeding a crowd. I didn't use canned chili. I used Ranch Beans. I added a lot more chili powder and fresh chopped jalapeños. The recipe helped me with ratios of meat, tomatoes, vegetables, etc. Thanks for sharing!

Wife loves it, although I did omit 1 hot chili and the spicy beans to give it a little less kick. Still-tasted delicious! The combo of ground beef and Italian sausage was great.

A little time consuming to make, but so worth it.  This is by far the best chili ever!  I have made this chili at least a dozen times with trying other recipes in between and always come back to this one.  This recipe is THE BEST!

This is, hands down, THE best chili I have ever made or eaten. I believe it is because of two things: the beer & the fact you make it the day before eating it. Those two are a must!!! It also freezes well and can be served with baked potatoes, corn bread, tortilla chips, corn chips, crackers, cheese, tons of guacamole & sour cream, cheese, you name it!!! Love this recipe!

I wanted to make it first before changing it but had no chili peppers so subbed a habanero and two Serrano peppers. I also halved the recipe because it’s huge and only had 2 lbs meat, so it was meaty. This was pretty spicy like we like it.i also omitted the Tabasco since it was hot enough

I like this recipe for a large crowd. I mostly made it as instructed but at the end I was worried it would not quite feed 20-30 people. I ended up adding a few more cans of various beans, tomatoes, paste and beer. It must have been a hit or everyone was just hungry because there weren’t any leftovers. After reading all of the reviews I think I will make a few of the recommended modifications and see if I can win the Chili cook off at work next year.

Delicious chili!  We shared this meal with some friends on a cool winter day, and it was a big hit.  I had to make a few revisions based upon the ingredients that I had on hand and personal preference:  exchanged water for beer, left out the Worcestershire sauce, used 1 tsp of hot sauce rather than 2, and used 1 4-oz can of chopped green chilis rather than 2 chopped and seeded green chili peppers.  The chili still had enough “zing” to it to warm you up.  My guests loved it!

Oh my, this is the best chili ever IMHO. It's also received rave reviews from friends and family when I made it for them. So good! I've made it in the crock pot and it turns out great (I just cook the meat first). And I don't eat red meat so I make it with turkey - Yum!

I made this for the Super Bowl 2018. I am a good cook and almost embarrassed to say I have never made chili!! This recipe was a HIT!!! My husband is extremely picky and went back for seconds...and thirds! I did eliminate the sausage (only because he wouldn't have even tried it!). Other than that, I mostly stuck to the recipe and it was one of the best chili's I have ever had...thanks for posting this recipe!

I made this last month and then my husband made it this month. He followed the recipe exactly and I did find it spicy. I cook more by my 'gut' and it was the best chili I ever made. I did not add green chili peppers or Tabasco. Also, used mild chili beans and all hamburg after reading other reviews about the spicy kick. Followed the rest of the recipe very closely and it was perfect.  Of course, he liked his version better than mine.....so it all depends on how spicy you like things. Both were quickly gone.

Followed recipe but left out tobacco sauce and cut back a little on chili powder.  Still too hot for wife and children.  Tried to "cool" it down by adding another can of plain kidney beans, another pound of ground beef and another 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Also added in some baby bella mushrooms.  That helped and I will make it again, but will cut back substantially on chili powder and other hot ingredients.

My first review ever on AR. I made it for the Super Bowl and it won everyone over! I even had a taste war with a relative who made their own “famous chili” and mine the crowd chose mine! I omitted the jalapeño and Chile peppers and it was still spicy with the black pepper and Tabasco sauce. I did add rosemary and used a generous amount of Corona in my chili. I cooked it in a crock pot for 6 hours on high and 4 hours on warm. It was amazing will make again!

This recipe was my first attempt at making chili even though I've eaten lots of it in my life and I must say it did not disappoint!  So delicious!!!

Can someone Please help me out on this?  I am getting all the ingredients together for this recipe (I can't wait to make it), I have a spice blend that contains ancho chili powder, garlic, cumin, onion, cilantro, paprika, cayenne pepper, lemon peel, Mexican oregano, natural smoke flavoring, and jalapeno pepper. Can I use this or would I be better off going by the recipe and using the individual spice ingredients?  (yes, I'm a rookie!)

This chili is The Bomb!  I did my shopping at Trader Joe’s so had to make quite a few subs to the TJ versions of several ingredients like the beans, the hot sauces, the diced tomatoes (those were a fire roasted version - YUM), the chili pepper etc.  I added some salt and a bit of Penzeys Roasted Garlic after it was basically done and what we have is a full delicious initial mouth flavor with a really neat back of the mouth “kick” at the end -  can’t wait to kick some butt at the chili cook off tomorrow!

We are Texans and we thought this chili was amazing!  I made a few edits - used only 2 cans of chili beans in medium sauce, used a whole bottle of Guinness Beer, used brown sugar instead of white and sauteed the chopped veggies in a little bacon grease before throwing them in the pot.  We entered this into our school chili cook off and while it didn't win - it was by far the crowd favorite!!

Followed the recipe for the most part ... excluded the hot sauce because for those who think mild is spicy, used a full beer and doubled the sugar - a great hot meal for a cold winter's night!

This recipe was great! The only changes I made was that I omitted the ground sausage and celery. The only reason I left those out was that I didn't have any. Awesome recipe, nonetheless.

I've been making this chili for years and people are obsessed with it.  I use more meat and less beans than the recipe calls for.  But everything else in this recipe is followed EXACTLY and it always turns out amazing.

My favorite side is cheddar biscuits.  Enjoy!

Perfect!  Did not use bell peppers.  Green chili's utilized in Ro-tel Tomatoes.    Meat substituted with Sirloin Steak cubes.  Yummmmm!!!  Cooked in crock pot 8 hours.  Beer IPA!!!
1/2 Bushes Chili Beans/1/2 red beans.  
Topped with Sour Cream, mixed variety of Cheddar Cheese and Fritos.  We ate it all.  Even better the next day!

Excellent chili,  I first made both with meat for my son and without for the rest of my family, and  both versions were great! The spices are perfect, and I've made it  two more times in the last month!  Excellent, and "forgiving"  about substituting  more beans or other long cooking veggies for vegetarians, but my son was wild about the original recipe with meat!

Delicious!! I used regular kidney beans, as we don’t have spicy ones in Canada (that I could find). I used half spicy Italian sausage and half regular. I used four (4) jalapeño peppers in lieu of cayenne and hot pepper sauce. I found the pot a bit dry, so I also added a cup of water before letting it simmer for 3 hours on low. I found that the chilli didn’t need extra salt, so I omitted that ingredient. You can always add salt after the pot has simmered, but you can’t take it out if you find it’s too salty at the end of the cooking process.

I added about 1 pound of stew meat and used 2 serrano and 2 jalapeño chili’s. Also substituted 2 14oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes for one of the 28pz diced tomatoes and a can of garbanzo beans for one of the chili beans. Added 1 6oz can of diced green chili’s.
Next time I will use one can of each, garbanzo, red kidney, chili, black beans just for variety. Perhaps add a can of corn also.
Bottom line is the chili is delicious and I will make it again.
Unless you’re making this for a large crowd I’d suggest reducing the ingredients by 1/2. As written this make a huge pot of chili and you’ll need two crock pots or a gigantic stew pot

I make this all the time and it’s delicious. I use a tsp of hot cocoa mix instead of sugar. I sometimes throw in some chipotle in adobo sauce if it’s just my husband and I eating it because we love some heat.

A hit at a party but I'm unconvinced this is amazing. It just seems like chili to me. Maybe next time I'll try out different meats.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!   I had some ground venison that I had no idea what to do with.  I had never cooked with it before and a friend gave me some to try so I chose this recipe for it.  I am SO GLAD I DID!
I did pretty much everything the recipe called for with the exception of not really measuring out my spices.  I was pretty heavy handed with the cayenne and hot sauce because we like our food with a bit of a kick to it.  I also used a jalapeno Italian sausage which also kicked it up a notch.
The results were incredible.   I am SO making this one again even if I have to use ground beef instead.  It will be delicious no matter which meat I choose... Beef  or venison, this recipe is a keeper!
Thanks MIGHTYPURDUE22,  for this recipe!

PS...   I used the entire bottle of beer ;-)

I've been reading some of the reviews and now, I can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow!  I simmered it on the stove for almost 3 hours, but letting all of those AMAZING ingredients develop overnight are sure to keep me dreaming about tomorrow!

ALSO, the reviewer from Texas that gave this a terrible review...  I lived in Texas for YEARS and NEVER had chili there that was as good as this and I went to MANY chili cook offs wile living there.   Don't get me wrong...  I LOVE TEXAS food!  AMAZING and if you have never tried it, you should!  HOWEVER, THIS chili will rival anything I ever tasted there.

Made it for a group of friends on New Years Day and everyone loved it.  I actually cooked it the night before, and by the next morning it had lost a bit of heat so I added more chili pepper and Tabasco sauce to kick the heat back up a notch.  I also made it with 2 jalapeños instead of green chilies, for more heat.   Must serve with Frito chips and shredded cheddar cheese for the perfect texture.

A fantastic result every time I make it. This is my go to chili recipe and share it with everyone!  It's fun to tweak it for different audiences and gauge the response.

I have won several Cookoffs with this one. Highly modified depending on how I'm feeling at the time.

Recently made this in my Instant Pot.  Well, I started it in my 6 qt instant pot... this recipe does NOT fit in a 6 qt pot.  I ended up transferring to my crockpot and then putting 1/2 back to my Instant Pot.  Definitely takes some work, but it's really good.  I've entered this into a couple of chili cook-offs at work and end up in the top 3 prior to Instant Pot.

We made the chili but added Navy bean, Great Northerns as well as plain Baked beans. We substituted honey instead of sugar, added diced potatoes as well. We added additional onions and celery too. I drank the beer!

It was a huge hit!

I love this recipe!! I have been using it as a base for years.  We're having a snow day and this chili was all I could think about. I love it so much. Now I know people hate when reviewers mess with the recipe, but I feel it's one where you can. Especially if you're using whatever you have on hand or if you/your family can't eat certain things. Which is normally what I do. I had a leftover yellow and red pepper so I used those, the last of my celery and some shredded carrot. I must have run out of jalapeños  so it's not spicy this round.  This time I had like 5 lbs of beef (this is going to last us a few days which I wanted), so I doubled the tomatoes, but still only one can of paste. Since I am eating LCHF, I left out the beans and the others in my house don't mind that. I add the chef's base seasonings and then from there, season to taste.  I also never add the beer. I don't keep it in the house so never have it when I make it. One day I will add it to see how it tastes. OH and I added Better Than Buillion b/c that was all we had around.  I also left out the sugar.  It's a great chili!

I love smothering it in sour cream, cheese, and jalapeños.

BEST CHILI EVER!!! This is my go to recipe for now on. It is delicious! The only thing I did differently was that I cooked the meat first then put all the ingredients into the crockpot and cooked on low for 6 hours! I used bud light for the 1/2 cup beer.

Great recipe!!! used 2 cans of mild Bush’s kidney beans and 1 can of red kidney beans. Also used water instead of beer bc we forgot to buy the beer. Used hot Italian sausage which we believe gave it a kick. Everything else was by the recipe and it came out perfect!

Husband and son said it was the best  chili they’ve ever had.  I added more bacon.  I don’t like too spicy, so I didn’t add the Tabasco sauce or cayenne pepper.

Not sure how many times I've made this now.  It's become a  staple around here when the cold weather settles in.  The heat mellows a bit after a day in the fridge.  It's still a bit hot for Mom, but a dollop of sour creams does the trick.    This makes a LOT of chili... so I freeze it in one cup containers.  Now the work's all done and I have delicious chili on hand for the next month or two!! :)

I made this a few times this year, I swear it is the best chili I have ever had! if I'm looking for a little more spice, I substitute out the chili beans for spicy chili beans and add a small can of jalapenos instead of green peppers. This recipe is delicious just as it is, my 2 year old loves it too!

This is one of the best chili recipes I've ever tasted, and I say this as a casual chili, taco, nachos, etc enthusiast.  Now, mind you, I love chili, tacos, etc, but haven't deviated much from the common preparations until I followed this recipe to the letter.

/n

 This chili is THE BEST chili I've eaten in a long while. Unless you hate beans in your chili , if you come onto Allrecipes.com and do NOT try this chili at least once, you've failed to provide your own tastebuds and those of your friends, family, strangers, and guests you're feeding with true chili. 

/n

I've since incorporated much of this recipe (especially the spices, sugar, etc and the small amount of celery, then cook slowly on lower heat until ALMOST browned, then put in the taco mix for 5 min at high heat) into my taco recipe (which isn't too different from following the recipe on the back of the box that gives you the dinner kit, except I use 1/2 a pound of ground beef lean and half pound of chorizo), and it's delicious and much much much better.

/n

Again, as someone who isn't a culinary extremist or career chef, I call this true chili. Some on here (look at the tiny amount of 1 and 2 star reviews) think that because you use a lot of the powered variants of many hot peppers and franks red hot, it's not "authentic". I call bull, but if you want to make it more "authentic" while still experiencing an amazing version of chili, remove ALL the powdered spices, get fresh ingredients and use the real live pepp

So yummy, I love this chili and it was a hit at home especially if you like a nice kick to your food. Never was a fan of chili until I tried this out. It requires a lot of ingredients which is costly at first, but a lot cheaper  afterwards and all the ingredients can be easily used for other dishes.

This is the best chili I’ve ever had. I like to spice it up a bit so I use 2 jalapeños, 2 serranos and 2 habaneros. I typically use whatever older homebrew I have on tap for the beer. Otherwise, I just follow the recipe and it’s amazing. 5 stars.

I made this chili for a cook off and I won hands down!  People were getting seconds of mine and ignoring the others.  I even had one person text me the next day requesting another helping if I had any left.  I did make a few changes.  Not only did I increase the brown and white sugars, I threw in a quarter cup or so of unsweetened cocoa.  I substituted jalapeño peppers, finely diced, and doubled up on the cumin for an additional kick.  Like another reviewer, I sautéed the vegetables and garlic in bacon grease and some olive oil (I cooked and crumbled three strips of bacon instead of bacon bits).  I can attest that it is a time consuming recipe but the outcome was fabulous!  I’ll definitely make it again when I have plenty of time.

I've made this several times & it's my go - to chili recipe.  Just won a chili cook off with this!  I agree with a previous reviewer who said to cook it a day or two ahead of time & reheat - this really gives the flavors a chance to develop.  This chili has a definite kick to it, but it mellows & is a bit less spicy when reheated the next day.  I do think the recipe is a little too salty as is.  I recommend leaving out the teaspoon of salt initially, then add a little salt later if needed.

My wife told me to find a good chili recipe for supper last night.

This was it.  And it is excellent, if a little hot (spicy).

We cut the hot spices in half (chili pepper, chili powder, cumin, hot sauce and cayenne) and it was still plenty spicy.

MMM...MMM  GOOD!!

WARNING!!!  This makes a lot of food.  four to six quarts, by my estimate.  Unless you are providing food for an army or a large party, do your best to cut it down.  We used a LARGE dutch oven for preparation and it was filled when we were done.

It does store well and you will go back for more later in the day or week.

Well done, even for a Boilermaker.  GO BLUE!!

Enjoyed it very much and will make it again. The tomato paste (6 oz can) really gave the chili a thick tomato presence and taste. We added enough unsalted beef broth and ingredients to make a full 8 qt. crock pot full. Made it during our 1st snow which is the perfect time for a very Hearty chili.

Excellent overall flavor and the family reviews were great as well. I didn't make any changes, but I did need to scoop some of it out as I did it in the slow cooker and it was too much food. The flavor was incredible and the spice just right. I kicked mine up a little in my individual bowl with some Tabasco, but the wife can only take so spicy.

I have been using this recipe for the last 6 years.  I add more beer to the recipe.  More like 3/4 cup.  And I go heavier on the chili powder.   People always want me to make it.  Love it.

I have made this about a dozen times in the last year for lots of groups and everyone always says it is the best they've ever had. It's a little time-consuming than my previous favorite chili recipe, but well worth it! The only substitute I make is to use ground venison and venison sausage. Even those people who claim they don't like "deer meet - ewww!" like this chili.

This is a great chili recipe.  It's easy to throw together and  is a crowd pleaser.  You can kick up the flavor by adding a stronger porter beer or adjust the spices but the overall foundation of this chili is a winner.  I am requested to bring it every year to our annual tree cutting tailgate that feeds 6 large families.  I've recently started adding Chipotle seasoning to it and wow, it makes it that much better.  You won't be disappointed and don't lesson to the nay sayers who haven't even tried it but can't get past the adding celery or peppers to the recipe.  Everyones tastes are different and if you like a hardy bowl of chili, this is it.

Best chili recipe I’ve found. I’ve made it 3 times and it’s very good. I found that Guinness beer works the best.

My husband is not a fan of beans in chili, so I only put one 15 oz. can in (the beans in the spicy sauce) and this chili was fantastic!! No one can taste the pork sausage or the bacon bits, but maybe that's the magic of this chili...excellent!

Fantastic chili.  I added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms, for texture and a bit of colour.  This is a very spicy (hot!!) chili, which for me is great, but for my girlfriend, I may have to tame it a bit next time.

Great chili! My coworkers loved it and ask me to make it all the time. We make a more keto version without the beans now that we're on a new diet, upping the meat to make up for it, and it still comes out  amazing. Thank you for sharing!

I made a couple changes.  We don't eat Pork, so I used ground beef, beef spicy sausage and ground lamb.  I also didn't make it quite as spicy as the recipe calls for and it came out just right.  I also eliminated the beer because I cannot eat gluten but the chili was still terrific.  My husband loves it and so do I.

This is a good base to use. Add a little less or a little more of whatever items you'd like.  I add a little more of each seasoning and also a little liquid smoke.  I usually add a little sirloin steak as well.

Yep. It’s fantastic. I don’t like so much spice, so I will cut the hot pepper out and probably the chili pepper in half and then add more later if needed. Glad i had no paprika on hand. Sour cream would be a nice addition to the ingredients for a reminder. I also just used 3 lbs of ground chuck and no sausage,  but I just couldn’t find it at the store. So good, thanks!

I made this recipe and entered it in a chili cook off contest  and won first place! I got so many compliments on it.  It has just enough spice to it and is so flavorful.  Hint:  put it in a crockpot and cook it for at least 24 hours.  Its even better as leftovers.

I made this for a staff luncheon, so I used mild chili beans for all four cans.  I also bloomed the spices while cooking the meat to get full flavor from the oil-soluble spices. Absolutely delicious.

Solid standard chili recipe. Next time I'll try the suggestion to brown the meat and then cook all day in the crock pot.

I've tried dozens of chili recipes and this is hands-down my favorite. I like to mix it up a bit and use a pound of spicy Italian sausage and a pound of sweet Italian sausage along with 1 pound of ground beef. really enhances the flavor profile.
5 stars!

I do not like super hot foods so the only change i made was to use medium hot chili beans instead of hot. This has a "little" kick to it which is just fine. It is a wonderful, hearty chili, but be warned - this will not fit in an average crock pot. I had to make it in an extra large pot. It will probably fill two standard crock pots. Otherwise, great recipe!

Quite disappointed with the taste considering all the ingredients that went into this. I have had better chili that was made with Old El Paso chili seasoning mix. Not going to make this recipe again.

Perfection.  The crispiness of the vegetables MAKES this chili.  Do not over cook it, 2-3 hours tops.  You don't want the veggies to go to mush.  PS, I won the work chili cookoff with this.

I love this recipe - I make it for every event where chili is needed: football games, Halloween party, apres-ski, etc.  It's a little spicy for my little ones, so I forego the tabasco and spicy chili beans, but leave in the cayenne pepper.  Delish!

I made this vegan style and it was amazing. No chuck, no sausage, no bacon, no beef bouillon, no cheese. I forgot the celery and Tabasco. I hate it when people rate and review recipes that they've altered but here I am doing it. Oh,well. It was so good.

My whole family loves this chili!  The only change that I make is that I use only 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of cayenne chili per batch.     

Lately I’ve substituted the 2 lbs of ground beef with only 1 pound of ground beef and then one package of veggie crumbles.  The crumbles give you that ground beef texture, but you don’t get as much grease and fat in the dish.

Really good chili! Way to spicy for the kiddos, so I tamed it down with a can of pineapple (puréed by immersion blender), which helped a bit. Served it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on top and a Hawaiian Roll on the side. Delish!!

Turned out wonderfully! Perfect for a icy and cold day in Minnesota. It just happened to help me win the Chili Cook Off at work!!! Thanks All Recipes!

Made some changed based on what I had. Used two pounds of spicy Italian sausage and only one pound of ground beef chuck. Also, I used a whole bottle of Guinness instead of just a the portion of a cup that it recommended. This made the Chili a little more liquidy, which I enjoy. Also helped so you could actually taste some of the beer. My two chili peppers consisted of one jalapeno and one poblano to add the heat.

Would definitely make again!

Never made chili before but this recipe was good enough to win the neighborhood chili competition. There are a lot of ingredients as folks have said, but most of the spices most kitchens will already have. Actual prep time is only about 20 minutes. This is definitely good when cooked for ~3-4 hours the night before on low in a crock-pot then re-heated for a couple hours before serving. The spice level is good for small portions, but if you're eating a large bowl it might be worth taming down a bit.

Didn't realize the return key is the done key. So to continue...my first time ever making chili and entered into a contest and it won. People know that right chili flavor, so I'll let them be the judge.   I substituted fish sauce for the worschester and used real bacon bits and only half the chili pepper and it was perfect. And to also be a Purdue alum makes this my go to chili recipe in the future!

Very good! I made it the day before. I did not add the hot sauce or the cayenne pepper because I didn't know what everyone's taste would be at our tale gate. I also used 2 poblano peppers and smoked paprika.

This chili recipe is one of my favorites. I love to try new ones and last night I made this one and I'm very happy with the results. Typically the first time I make recipe, I follow it to the tee but this time I made two changes that I don't believe hurt it at all. I used the whole bottle of Guinness, which was 11.2 oz. and I used only two cans of chili beans and added a can of seasoned pintos and a can of black beans, because that's what I had on hand.  I don't consider one other change a true change, I used lean diced chuck and about 1/4 pound of ground chuck, just because I like it a little chunkier. I always make my chili by the "how to make chili like a champion" article on this site. If you haven't tried it, it's a must do, it really makes a difference.

I made this last night at 7pm, cooked it until about 10pm, let it 'rest' in the fridge until today.  Into the crockpot at 9:30am this morning and into three chili judge's mouths at 11:45am.  At 1pm my chili was the 1st place winner of this year's chili cook-off!  

I made just a few changes to the recipe but stayed true to most of it....HIGHLY recommend this chili as it was excellent.  Most talked about one at the cook-off.

1)  I did 1.25 pounds ground chuck (thick grind for chili), 1.25 pounds mild Italian sausage, and 1.5 pounds of cubed top round (about 1/2" square pieces).  I also went with 6 pieces of crispy bacon instead of the small amount called for in the recipe.  My goal here was different sizes and textures of meat.  Achieved!

2)  For the beans I used 4 different bean types all Bush's beans: 
- 1 can of Chili Beans (Red beans) in medium sauce
- 1 can of Chili Beans (Black beans) in mild chili sauce 
- 1 Can of  Chili Beans (Kidney beans) in mild chili sauce
- 1 can of Chili Beans (Great Northern beans) in mild chili sauce
The recipe called to drain the beans.  I did NOT drain any of these beans.  Goal on this was different color variation and flavor combo...Goal Achieved and it was a great choice!

3)  I used an entire bottle of IPA beer vs. the little bit it called for.  Again a good decision!

4)  I used 1 standard red chili pepper, 1 Chilaca (Pasilla) pepper, and 1 Serrano pepper.  There definitely was some heat on the final dish but definitely not too hot at

I browned the meat in a skillet and then put all the ingredients in to the slower cooker, and came out great.  I may have added a little more beer than it called for, 3/4 to 1 cup.  It has a nice amount of heat to the recipe, which many might think it is too spicy but not for my family and friends.  Will definitely be doing this one again!

By far the best chili recipe I've ever used! Will be my go to from now on. Only sub I made was using a can of kidney beans and black beans in place of two of the cans of chili beans. Spice was just right. A little heat to remind you you're eating chili but nothing over powering.

This was my first time making chili and it was a WINNER!! To simplify, I omitted the bacon, celery,  and beer, and only used two cans of chili beans. This was a hit and I will make again!

Perfect! Made exactly as it was written- people write a review giving it a poor rating and they altered it... hmmm that doesn't make sense- we love a thick chili - and all the different flavors came through nicely- I will keep it in the chili rotation

My new go to chili recipe. Flavorful, with infinitely variable heat possible. Great texture, with lots of vegetables, beans and meat. I traded elk for some of the beef and added some bacon to keep it moist.

I personally like this chili but some people I've made it for didn't. It's very different than your average chili and I probably wouldn't make this for a crowd of people who are expecting "real" chili.  If you're looking for something different though, this is a good recipe to try.

I'm going to disagree with the masses here and say it was simply okay. My husband begged me to try this for several years, and since it made so much and there were so many ingredients I was reluctant. We finally made it for company one weekend and it was simply chili. There was nothing special about it, especially considering the additional work that was put into it. He enjoyed it, but I could tell it was not what he had hoped it would have been. It was much too spicy for my taste, but he found it perfect as far as spice.  Maybe my heart just wasn't behind it, since so many of you folks enjoyed it! Perhaps I'm just not a chili cook, and that's okay. I don't regret trying it, but for the work I don't know if I'd make it again.

I almost cut and pasted Nhi's review LOL.  I made it Friday night for a Saturday chili cook off.  out of 35 entries I took 2nd.  I left out the celery, used a jalepeño and a ghost pepper.  yes, I said ghost pepper.  I also added a 1/4 cup of BBQ spice.

So I read the reviews and decided this was the recipe I would make to enter into our neighborhood chili cook off contest last night.  Guess who won 1st place?  I thought I was in trouble when my crock-pot was the first one to empty out and the sampling was still going on but I guess enough votes carried me through. Just be sure to bring some extra if you enter a contest as it goes fast. Everyone now thinks I'm a chef.  A costly recipe but a winning one for sure. It really is delicious and that coming from someone who lived in Texas for 20 years.

I used my own roasted tomato purée instead of store bought canned tomatoes and used jalapeño peppers in place of chili peppers and left out the beer (gluten free that way) taste as good as the original recipe.  Best chili I've ever had!

This is a winner.   I used mild green chiliS with tomatoes from a can.    Everyone loved it.   I'll make it again.   Takes some time to cut up veggies by hand so try using a food processor to chop to save time.

I've made this chilli several times and it is always a hit!!! I make it in my slow cooker. It makes a huge batch so you are always ready for extra people to pop in!!!  Or freeze it for  another meal. Follow the recipe and you won't be sorry!!! We like to serve this while watching CFL football in Canada!!!  Go Riders!!!

I am chili choosy. This is the best I've ever had! I usually keep the recipe as is the first time I make it but I didn't have chili peppers so I used a half of a can of chilies in adobo. I cut the heat just a wee bit. And I added 1 tablespoon of Trader Joe's Umami. Flavor was amazing! This is a dish of delish!!! I can't wait to make this for my chili loving friends.

This was some great chili, and the recipe is very forgiving. No measuring, just chop, dump, and go. We ate the leftovers for a week afterwards, and had some to freeze too. Big fans.

We have been making this recipe for several years now.  It is always a hit.  It is our go to recipe when we want chili.

I was looking for a recipe for a chili cook off at the office. I came across this one and decided to go for it. Not only was it delicious, but it made TONS and won the whole thing. Great chili! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Giving this four stars since I made changes. I cooked this the day before, refrigerated, and then threw in crock pot the next day. I used less spicy ingredients - half chili beans in (mild) sauce and half regular pinto beans (drained). I used 1 can rotel diced tomatoes (chiles included, mild) and 1 can regular diced tomatoes. I left out the celery, chile peppers, black pepper, and hot pepper sauce. I cooked 1/2 package of bacon and threw it in. Then I cooked the onion and bell peppers in the bacon grease and added. Mine ended up way too salty, but I think it is because my chili powder (1/4 cup is a lot!) contained salt. I would be careful and add the boullion and any salty ingredients LAST, and slowly. I think I only used 2-3 cubes of boullion.

I made the recipe exactly like it reads and it turned out so good.  We are a family of 4 and this recipe is set for a serving of 12, it was just enough.  We didn't have too much left over.

Really good!  This is the one I'll make again.  I cut down the cayenne and hot sauce in half.  Better to add more if it needed it.  It was perfect for us.  I also used one chipotle pepper in adobe sauce in place of the green chili with seeds.  Again, perfect for us.  Otherwise, I followed the directions and it is just the best chili I've ever made.  My husband raved over it.  It make a lot so I'll freeze half of it.  The second day it was even better.  Love, love, love it!

So far, it's not bad. I cut the recipe in 1/2 (6 portions total), used 1/2 lb ground chuck and 6oz mild sausage. Added more garlic, veggies & beans.  I seasoned the veggies with salt & fresh garlic, then partially simmered them down. Added a little more than 1/2 of the spices to the veggies.

I then seasoned the meat with salt & cooked it down with onion & garlic. Half way through cooking the meat, I added the remaining spices & cooked it through. Then I added the partially cooked veggies, beer ( pumpkin leinenkugels) beans with chili sauce (omitted spicy chili beans, since I put in 2 large jalapenos In the veggies), tomatoes dark & light kidney beans added as well. When I tasted it, it didn't need the bouillon cubes at all. I also added a heaping tbls of white sugar, rather than a tsp.

So far so good. It's simmering now, and may need tweaks at the end prior to serving, but it's a good chili starter recipe.

I make this Chili all the time with about 90% of the ingredients depending on what is available and rarely measure anything.  It is awesome every time.  Use this as a base and change up to taste.  I like to use extra chorizo.

We liked it quite a bit. It was a little too spicy the first day. Somehow it mellowed overnight so the leftovers were not as hot. In general it was better day two overall, not unlike most chili.

Delicious! I followed the modifications of some of the other reviewers and made some adjustments of my own, 
Halved the recipe, used 1.5 of beef chuck steak, 1lb of italian mild sausage and used 4 strips of bacon (substituted actual bacon for the bacon bits), added a cup of beer- used Hanger 24 Double IPA, and a 1/2 cup of beef broth. The added liquid made it super soupy which I'm not personally a fan of so thicken it up I added 4 cups of beans- 1 pinto beans in hot sauce, 1 kidney beans in mild (drained the kidney beans), and 2 additional cups of mixed chili beans- also drained- , 2 cans of tomato paste, omitted the spoonful of hot sauce, added a tablespoon of brown sugar, used a green chili and a jalapeno both seeded and cut, also omitted the bell peppers and sauted the onion, garlic- 4 cloves- chilies and celery in the bacon drippings prior to throwing them in the crockpot along with everything else

I happened to find this recipe about 2 years ago and saved it, I have made for many family gatherings and football Sundays and it comes out wonderful every time. I usually use Oktoberfest for the beer, adds a nice taste to it. Great recipe and very tasty, it's been added to my permanent go-to recipes. I'm actually making it again tomorrow :)

We have been making this recipe for years, and everyone RAVES about it! Now, I do omit the Italian sausage, and add an extra lb of beef or pulled pork. It alway turns out great! We use the crockpot most of the time to finish cooking this. Sometimes we change it up and add a little beer too. Wonderful, everyone asks for the recipe and I act like it's my family's secret chili recipe

This recipe was outstanding! Followed the recipe but halved the chili powder based on reviews. You can always add more a little at a time after tasting.

As always, my rating is based completely on making the recipe as provided.  This is a major winner!  When it comes to chili, this is my go to.  I've made it on several occasions and each time have had nothing but high praise.  Don't worry though, I've made sure that the person posting the recipe and this website got all the credit.  A huge thumbs up, bravo to the chef!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was a huge hit!  My husband raved and my 20 month old son gobbled it up three nights in a row.  What made it great was the depth of flavors and wonderful spice.  This is my new go to chili recipe.

This recipe ROCKS!!! I even made it once without the beans and it still rocked. For the meatlovers I throw in a little sliced kielbasa with the ground beef. The recipe requires no adjustment, but the variety of spices and seasonings leaves plenty of room for playing around with what works for you. Be careful with the spicy ingredients though unless you love the kick like I do!!! Enjoy...

Pretty great recipe. I’m really big on flavor, so increased the amount of spices and I added another pound of sausage. Also used chopped cooked bacon instead of bacon bits.

This was a beautiful chili...everyone said it was the best I've made.  I did reduce the amount of chili peppers by 1/2 and I added some sour cream and home made hot sauce.

I made minor changes but it makes the biggest difference. I made this once for a company xmas party and people were coming to shake my hand after they ate it. 

I add: 
1lb of chopped, cooked bacon. 
1lb hot Italian pork sausage is subbed for the regular sausage
1 lb veal chops bone in - the bone comes out after about 2 hrs of cooking
Also I may have left some of the bacon fat in the chili.... I forget

I also simmer it for 6 hrs.  This is the best chili I ever had

This is a basic recipe but I change a lot.Yes use 2/3 beef and 1/3 loose pork sausage. 2 lbs of meat makes ALOT so you can do 1/2 of this recipe. So...-Only 2 cans of regular beans of your choice. I like pintos1 big can diced tomatoesYes 6 oz tomato paste2 jalapeño peppers finely chopped instead of hot. No beef bullion cubesEither 1/2 cup beer or red wine No oreganoNo hot sauce ( let people who want killer spice put it in )I didn't use black pepper and cayenne. You can use a little if you want more heat. More cuminNo basilNo sugarYes 1/4 cup chili powder or less if it is VERY spicey Yes to some bacon chopped up if you have it. Or sauté in bacon fat. I first sauté meat and some onion with some of the spices till brown and then take it out and sauté the other veggies and add spices then. After they are soft I add back the meat and all the liquid and canned tomatoes and let simmer 2 hours. One more 15 oz can of tomatoes might be added if low in fluid and tomato.  Serve over rice.

A friend of mine sneakily signed me up for a chili cook off and this was the recipe I used. It was also my first time making chili without a seasoning packet. The only changes I made was that I substituted chorizo for the Italian sausage and I didn't know what green chilies looked like so I used a couple small cans of rotel tomatoes with green chilies in place of one of the large cans of diced tomatoes. It paid off! Everyone loved it and I took home first place and $100! Thanks for the recipe!

Sooooo YUMMY!!! 

Perfect for lunches. Easy prep and prepare. 

I made a few slight changes to the ingredients list: added more spice and more meat . I usually pass on measurements and season to my personal taste. 

Do include the beer; great flavour - I used a whole bottle rather than half (it will cook down don't worry), Heineken of course, only the best!  

I left it overnight (about 9 hours) on low in the slow cooker. But since everything is pre-cooked you don't really need to leave it all that long. Just re-heat and eat! 

Enjoy!

I'm not a chili fan but this has converted me. It's tasty, meaty, and has just the right kick to it. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I sauteed the veggies after the meat was browned. Very good!

This is hands down the best chili I have ever tasted or made! I used my favorite import beer (more for later!) I did not use the 2 green chile peppers. I used a lot of chili powder (6-7 TBSP), freshly ground black pepper and cayenne pepper, as well as extra basil, oregano and garlic. I used almost a full bottle of beer, fried 6 strips of bacon (lightly browned. It’ll continue to cook in the broth - some bacon fat in the broth adds flavor) then crumbled. Instead of 2 – 28oz. cans diced tomatoes, I used 4 – 14.5 oz. diced tomatoes – NOT drained.
I took the advice of other reviews and used 3 – 15oz. cans chili bean in mild sauce NOT drained; 1 – 15 oz. can chili beans in medium sauce.
I cook this in a slow cooker for at least 8 hours. I’ve taken it to parties and made for my collage age boys for winter break. It makes a ton of chili and never has any been wasted. As a little change up, I sometimes serve leftover chili over medium shell or elbow noodles (with a little water to give it more broth) and shredded sharp cheddar cheese, delicious too!

For some reason I truly was not impressed by this recipe. In fairness, it might have been something to do with the meat cut I used because it was not tender at all. The flavor also just didn't wow me. I did follow the recipe pretty exactly so I'm not sure where the disconnect happened since this recipe is pretty popular. Oh well. On to the next.

Made recipe for 24. It was so much chilli!!! I started off using a 7 Litre pot and had to add a second 4 Litre pot to cook the whole batch. I habitually pick too small of a pot for everything so it's probably just me...but anyway, note to self: this recipe as is "for 24" needs a 12 Litre pot

This is my favorite chili recipe. You can get creative with the heat by using different or more peppers, but wouldn't want too much heat to take away from the great flavor. Only differences I have were I put in crumbled bacon in and use a full can of beer instead. I also put a large chocolate bar on top in the last 30 minutes. Great recipe!!

The absolute best chili I have ever had and I have had a lot.  Chili is one of my favorites.    More cooked black beans and white beans were added plus 1 habanero and 2 jalapeños for a little kick.

I will give this 4 stars not because of the taste which was great, but because it was a hit or miss with my family of five.  The complaints was that it  was two hot.  I thought it was great.

This is my favorite chili recipe of all time, and i LOVE chili.  It's so flavorful, and just takes it to a whole other level.  We typically make a double batch and freeze half.  It keeps very well.  Usually if we haven't had it for more than a month I start craving it.

Awesome recipe I made it exactly as shown the first time and my boys loved it. The second time I added spicy chorizo and it gave it that extra kick.

I don't want it to be too hot, so I leave out the cayenne pepper and the tabasco.   I usually cut the recipe in half for just me and my husband and have it for dinner.  It always looks like I've made too much but it never makes it past the next day.  It's soooo good!

I've made it several times, and entered a few chili competitions (at work)  ....   I won every time!
I modify the recipe, 
3lb of beef / venison / bison
2 Red Jalapeno's  (or a habanero)
1 green chili 
2 cans of Bushes medium chili beans
2 cans of Bushes mild chili beans
28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with oregano and basil
no bacon bits... 
sometimes add chopped carrot 
no beer  (doesn't fit in my pot)
check heat (spice)  before adding pepper  black or cayenne
sometimes use all green peppers instead or red or yellow $$
this stuff is yummy, even following the as presented recipe.

Probably the best chili I've made so far. Thanks for this great recipe! (Note: Since I didn't have the other meats on hand, I used 1 lb of ground beef only, 3 cans of drained beans and halved each of the seasonings, minus the chili powder which was added as directed. The quantity of chili was smaller, but a perfect amount for our family of 3 - with leftovers.) Simple and delicious!

I liked this and I followed the recipe. I think next time I'd cut out the hot pepper and hot sauce. It was a little too hot for some of my friends.

The best chili recipe I have ever seen, used, and ate. I used everything except beer, and sugar because I dont like my chili sweet at all. I used some spicy hot sauce that made it even better.  I forgot to get green chili peppers but that didnt make a difference. It is best with Fritos corn chips. My serving size was about 6 and I used 1 pound of ground chuck and 1 pound of italian ground sausage. I substituted the beer for water instead and used a 1/2 cup instead of a 1/4. My suggestions are based on making 6 servings. I also cooked it for 2 hours which I think helped settle all of the ingredients.

This is the only chili I ever make. So good! I love planning a chili Sunday and chopping everything up and prepping the spices like I'm on a cooking show and then letting it simmer all day. I switch up the beer every time and the amount of peppers I include, but it's always a winner. A good amount of heat for these cold winter days. It's good hot, cold, over noodles or rice, over dogs, on nachos. It never lasts long and there is never any that gets tossed. Amazing!

Great Chili-a bit labor intensive.  Warning-this chili is HOT.  I am a novice cook so I followed a 5 star review and  reduced the chili powder and  hot pepper and did not add the hot sauce and my chili lover still said it was a bit hot.  Another reviewer said to add the spice afterwards, but I believe that cooking with the spice is what allows the flavor to develop.  I added a couple cans of chopped tomatoes, but if you are a medium "hot" person this might not be enough.  Otherwise this chili received a thumbs up and instructions to try again to individualize the intensity level.

Great! I did skip out on the beer. I found the chili powder to be much too over-powering, but I attribute that to the fact that I used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce which also contains chili powder I'm sure. I do love the addition of them so next time I'll add them and cut back on the extra powder. It's also more on the spicy side so if this is being cooked for young ones I'd cut back on the peppers a bit. Other than that it's a great chili recipe.

Not only is this delicious, I've found you can easily substitute some ingredients (not the spices) and still come out with a beautiful meal.  Flexibility is a big plus.  I did throw some chives on top of the chili before it was served and that went over well too.  The main work is in assembling the long list of ingredients; once you've done that, it is incredibly simple to make.

Awesome chilli!! Everyone loved it and came back for more...was not spicy at all for us, I actually split the batch in half and simmered 1 pot with a ghost pepper cut in half for 1 hour..Flavor galore and just the right amount of heat! My new favorite recipe!

With only a few changes (chicken broth instead of beer and 1 can of great northern, 1 can of light kidney beans, one can mild chili and 1 can hot chili beans) this is killer chili.  Everyone went wild over it.  Thanks!

Amazing. Best chili I've ever had. I couldn't find the "chili beans" so I just bought  cans of brown/kidney beans. Also, I replaced the beef chuck with ground beef because the grocery store didn't have chuck, and chili peppers with jalepenos because I like my food a little on the hot side. 

Make sure you have a huge pot or scale down the recipe because this makes a lot of food. I was eating chili for days.

I left out the chili peppers and Tabasco sauce.  The cayenne pepper and spicy chili beans gave it just enough bite where I was happy and the kids weren't turned off.  I served this over elbow macaroni for a Chili Mac, per request from the kids.

Won 1st place in a cook off this weekend with this as a base recipe.
Substituted sirloin for the ground chuck.
substituted Chicken Broth for beer.
Added 1 fresh, seeded jalapeno
used 2 cans of red beans and two cans of black chili beans, not drained. 
2 hrs high in the crock pot followed by 3 hours on low.

Had a nice slow heat finish. The sirloin may have been the winning factor.

Followed recipe except for following:  used all beef, no pork; didn't have bacon bits so omitted; added a little extra beer.  Didn't have one of the spices... this didn't turn out very good, might try again.

This is a great chili recipe. I've made it multiple times. I've used both chuck roast and the next time ground beef, cause that's what I had. The spicing is great.

This is the best chili that I have tasted.  I am from Canada so definitely we are not Chili makers.  I have made Texas Chili but this is the best.

I did this in the slow cooker for 6 hours.  The only thing that I did not include was green pepper, I used 2 red peppers, and omitted the sugar and  put honey in.  Also, I used smoked chipotle chili powder .  When the 6 hours was over I included the chili beans for another 2 hours.  

I will not be having a tailgate party but you bet my friends will be getting some of this chili for supper.  I keep going into the slow cooker and tasting.

I have friends who tell me they look forward to winter so they can have some of my chili!  I haven't changed the recipe, but I do let it simmer for 24 hours-on low-because I like the celery and peppers to get soft.

It was just okay.  With so many ingredients, I found it to be more trouble than it was worth.  I didn't enjoy that it cooked together into a big hot mess.  I didn't like the canned chili beans; they're too soft.  I prefer making a chili with kidney beans. I removed this recipe from my Recipe Box.

I left the Tabasco sauce out and used 1 Jalapeno pepper instead of two.  Still had a good amount of heat to it without being overwhelming.  I felt the prep time given was an underestimate.   It took me (amateur chef/real person) 45 minutes to chop, cook, locate and add all the ingredients.  If I make this again it will probably be on a weekend and perhaps in a slow cooker as I typically don't have this amount of time for cooking during the week!.

I generally followed this recipe. Couldn't find green chili peppers. So, I used a pablano pepper. I also added tablespoon of Chili 9000 from Penzey's.  I used brown sugar instead of granulated.  That being said, I won 1st place at our company's chili cookoff. I will definitely make this again!

Used 1 can each: plain black beans, plain kidney beans, plain pinto beans and "chili beans" in spicy sauce.  Diced canned chilis in place of fresh.  It was fantastic.  It makes a ton to freeze in portions or to serve a large crowd.  Super bowl party guests wanted the recipe!

We aren't used to spicy stuff in this house, so for us if I had followed the recipe it would have been way too hot. I made a couple changes, for the meat I used 1 lb ground moose, 1 lb ground beef, and 1lb of mild Italian sausage meat taken out of the casings. I only used 2 tbsp of chili powder, and only 2 cans of mild chili beans by Heinz. I also substituted the chili's for jalapeños.  I topped the chili with grated cheddar cheese and the corn chips really gave it a nice mix of flavours :)  the recipe was awesome though, only changed its bit due to the spicyness and some of the ingredients we had on hand :)

I made this over the weekend. I ended up drinking the beer and had nothing left for cooking,  I omitted the bacon bites because it was too burnt. I also only used one Jalapeno pepper and ignored all the spicy pepper ingredients . I cooked everything in a large bowl for about 40 minutes before transferring to a crock pot for 5 hours. It turned out great. I was delicious. Make sure you have a large bowl because you might be in for a surprise,  This recipe is meant for a family or group.

Doubled the sugar.  Added a little  balsamic vinegar  to each serving to enchante the flavor.
Added 1/2 cup/s of water to the mixture.

After browning the meats, I put it all in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 12 hours prior to serving.

This is excellent chili!!  I don't follow the recipe exactly.  I use 3 cans of undrained chili beans instead of 4.  I don't use an entire 1/4 cup of chili powder.  I also don't use any hot peppers or sauce (I do use the cayenne pepper).

I made a few changes -- just because -- but I think the original recipe would be excellent as well. I used two cans of spicy red chili beans (one drained) and two cans of mild white chili beans (both drained). Made sure I used no-salt-added diced tomatoes (there's plenty of salt still). Substituted one pound of stew meat for one pound of the ground beef. Used spicy Italian sausage. Substituted a small can of mild diced chili peppers instead of the fresh pepper (my roommate can't handle spice like I can -- I'd use the fresh pepper, seeds and all, if it was just for me).  I made my own bacon bits with four slices of bacon and used the grease to sweat the vegetable mix until most of the onions were translucent. I omitted the hot sauce. 

As others have noted, the ingredient list is huge (I spent more time at the grocery store than making the chili... well, almost) and the prep time is pretty significant. Can't argue with the results though. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and then let it sit overnight in the fridge before reheating for lunch the next day. 

BTW, this makes a lot of chili. I literally filled my big pot to the VERY top (stirring was an interesting endeavor). I'll get a bigger pot before I make this again. For those that said they made it in a crock pot... HOW? Where in the world did you find a crock pot that big?

Overall, this is my new go to chili recipe when I have the time and resources to put into it. It's not something I would just "whip up" though.

Game day crowd pleaser! I've substituted ground beef with ground turkey and it was just as yummy. I've also substituted Italian sausage for ground sage flavored sausage (Jimmy Dean) - either way it's always a favorite. Thanks for sharing!

I have to say this is the best chili I have not only ever made but have ever eaten!  This was so good that even though I thought I would have a lot to freeze we ended up finishing it.  I really can see winning a contest with it.  THANK YOU for sharing this amazing recipe!!!

Incredible chilli recipe! My family loves it every time. I wondered about making "boilermaker chilli" since I'm a diehard Notre Dame fan... but this is some great chilli!!  Seasoning is spot on and heat is great.

Made this recipe for the second time for Superbowl LI. Turned out great. Was a little too spicy the first time I made it for Superbowl XLIV so I cut all the hot spices in half and skipped the chili peppers.  The chili still had a little kick and was delicious.

This recipe turned out very, very well.  I would make it again.  I did take the seeds out of the chili pepper. It still had some zip to it, but not too much.  Also, I used my slow cooker.  The recipe makes a great deal of food and it hardly fit in my biggest pot, so I put everything in my slow cooker, put it on high for 2 hours and then cooked it on low for another 2  hours.  I put it in the fridge overnight and heated it up on high the next day.  With aged grated cheddar cheese and corn chips, it was wonderful.

Everyone loved this chili!  There weren't any leftovers! I followed the recipe without making changes.  I used Italian sausage, which contains fennel, I hate fennel!  It wasn't overwhelming, subtle fennel flavor.  Everyone loved it in there, but me, lol!  I would use regular sausage next time, just my personal preference.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars despite the fact that I've never made it exactly as stated.  I think it's got a lot of great elements and so I give it "5 stars" as a great place to start.  I don't add everything that the recipe calls for and I don't add what it does call for in exact proportions. for example,  I tend to start with 2 tablespoons of chili powder and work my way up from there.  Although I do a lot of changes I do have three strong recommendations . . .1. replace the sugar with swiss miss chocolate powder (I know.  sounds strange. you'll thank me later) 2. add chopped chipotle peppers and some of the sauce. (you can find this is the mexican food isle.  comes in a short can.  adds a smokey flavor.  they are spicy so start with 1tblsp and go from there).  3. use a flavorful sweet beer like guinness not a bitter IPA or flavorless pale ale.   That's all .  have fun.

My husband makes this chili, by (my) special request, for Superbowl Sunday.  It's become a tradition in our house.  This recipe is fabulous.

I grew in the midwest, eating "chili mac," so I spoon the chili over bucatini.  Add shredded cheese on top.  Heaven!

Made this for the Super Bowl on Saturday to enjoy Sunday.. Super easy recipe and full of flavor!! I only added 2 cans of beans rather than 4, and nixed the celery & sugar. Will definitely be making this again!

Really good chili. This makes a really large pot so I hope you're hungry. I halved the chili pepper and cayenne and it still have a nice little burn but not too hot. I also didn't add any salt (there's salt in the boullion) and didn't miss it. Yum!

Wonderful flavor. Ppl should be warned it will be a little spicy if made by the posted recipe. I did not include celery stalks or sausage. Used onions, green, yellow and orange sweet peppers. Added some actual beef broth to highlight the beef flavor. Tastes soooo good. My mom and dad love it. Sure to make it again!

This was just perfect.  A  family member is sensitive to cayenne, so I used a little ancho chili powder instead. I was worried that it would be a little too soupy so I added 1/4 cup masa flour. I had 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage to use up and added it to the 2 lbs of ground beef. I will use this recipe again. Thanks for posting it.

This is a great basic chili recipe. It's easy too whip up, easy to tweak the spiciness to your liking, the veg, bean, and meat ratios are perfect for a hearty chili. Barely visible Tweaks:) I used Nina Italian peeled tomatoes because the flavor is outstanding for a canned tomato, not sour like some brands, though you have to chop them up before adding them to the pot. I used two cans of kidney beans and two cans of Bushes black beans in chili sauce. I added Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA because the flavor is BIG. And added the bacon at the end after I tested the existing saltiness. Next time I would cut back the bouillon (in half) and add all the bacon because... it's so tasty.  If you have BIG flavors in your pot then you can use less salt or bouillon bring out those flavors. Viola delish. We served it with jalapeño cheddar cornbread. Jiffy, of course.

Hands down, the BEST chili I have ever made.  The only omission were the bacon bits because I forgot to purchase them.  This will be perfect for Super Bowl Sunday.  I will make Shepherd's  Chili bowls too (putting mashed potatoes on top with cheese and baking).  Recipe is a keeper!

This chili recepie is awesome. I went with 1 pound ground beef, 1 pound of cubed round steak and half pound sweet sausage and half pound hot sausage. Added a can of rotel diced chili and backed out 1/4 of the chili powder. I browned the meat and put it lol in my slow cooker for 7 hours and it came out delicious. No too hot. Cold beer recommended with this. Makes around 7 quarts. Enjoy:)

really good flavor, had to half everything and only used 1/2 lb ground turkey, 1/2 lb italian sausage and used chicken boullion and broth. too spicy so used equal parts sugar and apple cider vinegar in tiny bit of water to cut spice.  used 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp. vinegar.l omitted hot pepper sauce. can see making again as loved flavor.

The best chili I ever made! Family loved it. Followed exact recipe, lots of ingredients but I had almost all of them on hand anyway. It is a bit spicy, the way we like it, but you could reduce the hot spicy ingredients a bit if you like milder chili.

Not a bad base recipe. If you are looking for a simple and easy recipe to start out with and add your own flare to this is a good one, because it will taste good no matter what! I initially found it a bit simple, so I added 3 garlic cloves, another 1/2 tsp of salt and a beef bouillon cube. It was a bit to runny for my taste, so I am going to add a third can of beans (probably pinto to make it a 3 bean) next time.

I just made this recipe for our Apartment complex's First Annual Chili Cook off and I just won 1st place! For my chili instead of the regular italian sausage I used spicy italian sausage, a 7 can of green chilis, and 2 teaspoons of sugar instead of 1! Topped off with Fritos and the cheese, perfect! Sour cream would taste good as well! ENJOY food lovers!

Just like most people when I read their reviews  :) they added something different. My husband can't have a lot of red meat so we grounded our own chicken breast and substituted that with the beef. Also, since  I am a wimp with spicy foods so we took out any of the 'hot & spicy' stuff like chile peppers and it still turned out GREAT!

This is the first chili I've ever made a and it won 1st prize at the chili cook off tonight.  There is plenty of room for more heat if you want to add it but it's a crowd pleaser at its current level of heat.

I followed the recipe as close as I could. Living in wyoming sometimes makes some ingrediants hard to find. I couldn't find the spicey chili beans so I used the regular beans. I also used hot italian sausage. This chili is the best I've tasted in a long time, I took it to a football party at the local pub and everyone really liked it.

This recipe makes the best chilli I have ever had.  It is a bit spicy, but that can be regulated by the quantity of various ingredients. I prespire easily and was a bit damp when I started to down my second bowl. Tweak to your own delight, but as for my house, we'll keep using the same recipe.

I reduced the child powder to 1 tbsp and those who like it spicy could add hot sauce.  But they didn't - this seemed to be enough spice for all.

The best chili I ever made!  Loved all the layers of flavor after simmering all day in my slow cooker.  Left out the beer as we only had IPA and, though not specified, it just didn't seem robust enough for this recipe.  A neighbor dropped by  and asked if they could come for dinner as whatever I was cooking  smelled just awesome!  We don't like corn chips so I served over rice.  My husband doesn't like things spicy but had 2 huge helpings.  Will definitely be sure to get a beer fitting this recipe, to add it next time.  Will try corn bread with it rather than rice.

Made this again 1/18/19.  Used an amber ale and served with warm cornbread.  Just awesome.  My neighbor came over and said whatever I was cooking smelled amazing,  I sent over a big bowl the next day after it had chilled overnight.  She said even her children loved it.  Said it was one of the best she's had.

It's pretty close to the recipe I make but I am always looking for a new twist. I was doubtful about the Worcestershire sauce but it added a little something to it.

The texture of the chili becomes thick and rich which is nice for a cold evening.  Because I don't like hot spices I did not use hot Italian sausage (mild instead) or the spicy chili beans (non-spicy beans instead) but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  My husband liked the spice and thought it was just right.  I still thought it was too spicy.  My husband liked it enough to want it again.  I did not care for it.  He would rate it a 4 but since I am writing the review I am giving it a 3.

Fantastic chili. Followed the spirit of the recipe but I used fresh ground venison instead of hamburger, gianelli sausage patties for the pork, and my chili pepper of choice was a frozen habanero from the garden. I like extra cumin so increased that a little as well.  Will definitely make again.

This chili was wonderful!!! I followed the recipe with two very minor changes. I didn't have bacon bits, so didn't include those. I also didn't have green chilies, so used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilies in place of one of the cans of diced tomatoes.  I recommend putting a spoonful of sour cream  in your bowl--it's heavenly!!!

Alas, I am changing the name for my personal recipe. Since I hold degrees from two schools that are rivals of Purdue, it's Big Ten Chili in our household!!! Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!!!!

I haven't made it- for two simple reasons:  first, I have my own "prize-winning" recipe, which isn't all that complicated to make, second, any recipe such as this with over two dozen ingredients is nearly absurdly complicated.  If the taste needed to be corrected in any way, for example, just where would you start, with all those flavors swimming around?  Reminds me of the Johnny Cash tune about the Cadillac he pieced together from many years of helping himself to the GM plant's parts bin after work!  (Got a '52, '53, '54, '55, '56..." or whatever...  I gave it 3 stars  for that reason, though for all I know it may be really great stuff.  But not in my kitchen, sorry.  Too much work!

THIS IS THE BEST CHILI EVER! My family really enjoyed eating this especially my husband who is not really a chili eater. I read through the reviews and made a few modifications that were suggested. I reviews I read mentioned it yielded, which I didnt want, so I didn't put all the amounts recorded in the recipe.... I used beef stew meat (close to 2 lbs) and sweet Italian sausage (1lb) instead of ground beef. Cooked real bacon (4 strips) and sauteed the celery and onions in the grease before adding. I used less beef cubes (3), beans (1 mild and 1 spicy) and diced tomatoes (2 cans of oregano and garlic diced and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes). Used 1 jalapeno pepper, we did want a lot of spice and instead of the hot sauce, I used red pepper flakes. And instead of beer I used beef broth. Letting it sit over night really does the trick. I will always reference this recipe again. It is really, really good!!!!!

The family loved this chili!  I left out the red pepper (didn't have any on hand).  I was concerned about how spicy it would turn out but as it cooked and I tasted, I ended up throwing in red pepper flakes as well as additional pepper sauce.
Everyone loved it! Definitely will be making this again.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the beer choice in the video.  For a deeper flavor try an amber beer.  Preferably local.  Great chili.  Good enough for year round eating.

Excellent chili. I made it by the directions with a couple changes. Omitted the cayenne because it looked like too much heat. Omitted 1 lb of hamburger because  it would not fit in my crock pot. 1/2 cup of beer. hahaha...that's funny ! I used a cup+.
I'll make it again with the same changes .

Yes I will make this again!! Perfect for a large crowd and you do need a very large pot. This is a great recipe, easy to adjust to your tastebuds or to adjust to the ingredients available at your grocery store.
I sautéed 2 lbs of lean ground beef, mild sausage, one chopped medium yellow onion. Since I didn't have Italian sausage, I  added to the meat an extra tablespoon of each of the following: oregano, basil, minced garlic. 
Here are my other adjustments/substitutions.
I did not drain any of the cans of chili beans in the mild sauce (beans in mild sauce was all that was available at our store).
Substituted 2 serrano peppers for the 2 chile peppers.
3 tablespoons bacon bits.
5 cubes beef bouillon in 5 cups of water. Omitted the 1 teaspoon of salt.
1- 12oz beer.
1.5 tablespoons Turmeric.
3 teaspoons cumin.
1 teaspoon coriander.
Omitted cayenne pepper because we didn't want it too spicy.
Omitted the white sugar.

Some reviewers criticized the canned goods, so if you want to make fresh tomato sauce and use fresh beans it is easy to substitute and make those adjustments accordingly.

If you like it spicy hot, use the beans in spicy sauce plus more tabasco, chile peppers, and/or cayenne pepper.
This is a delicious recipe and was fun to make!

Good but I'm sure glad I ran out of chili powder!  1/4 cup!  I put 1 teaspoon and with everything else, that was enough of a "bite" for me.  (Though I've never gone for the 5-alarm type chili.)

I made the recipe as is and loved it.  So did my family.  I will say it is on the spicier side, which appeals to my family.  Some may want to forgo the hot sauce or reduce chili count.

I added 1/2 lb of cubed round steak, (because it was there) This was very good chili, one of the best I've tried. My daughter, who usually doesn't like my chili ate 2 nice sized bowls.
I cut the recipe in half as I was just making for my family.
I did add 1 Tbs extra of both Cumin and Chili powder after it had simmered and more salt to taste. I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a potluck with one slight change. Since I used hot Hungarian peppers I reduced the red pepper to half the amount. It was excellent and enjoyed by all.

Great recipe-although many ingredients there is nothing hard about it. I browned the meats, onion and peppers on stove, then placed in crock pot on high for 6 hours. Even better the next day!

This is the first chili that I've made that I've been satisfied with.  I did change just a few things though.  I hate beer, so I left that out.  I doubled the sugar plus added 2 tbsp of brown sugar as I prefer a sweet chili.  I also did not drain the beans at all and used a mixture of white chili beans as well as regular chili beans. I used the Hunts brand diced tomatoes made for medium chili.  I loved it.

This was sooo delicious!!! I made a few changes to it, either because I completely forgot to add it (celery & beer) or because I substituted something else for it. Instead of 2 lbs of ground beef, I did 1 lb beer and 1 lb ground turkey. I also am not a fan of green bell peppers so I used yellow/orange instead of the green. Instead of 2 green chili peppers, I did 1 green and 1 red chili pepper. I also left out the bacon bits. It was soooo good. It had a good kick to it. It wasn't so hot that you couldn't enjoy it, but the heat came after you took a bite and sat in the back of your throat for a bit. It was PERFECT!!! Not only did my fiance and I love it, but my soon to be father-in-law loved it, as well as my very hard to please (with food) friends, as he works in a kitchen and has very high standards - he LOVED this chili!!!! I already bought half of the ingredients to make it again next month!!!!

This is awesome chili. I made it to the recipe. It said "Beer" and as I am not a beer drinker I didn't know which I should use. Luckily I have a liquor store the size of a supermarket near my house. They recommended:

Original Schlenkerla Smokebeer (Urbock) its like a smoky beer so it was amazing in the chili.

This is a pretty good chili recipe indeed. There are many changes you could make with bean choices and beer selection to meet your needs but the overall flavor of seasoning and spice was quite balanced. Mine had a nice heat that lingered shortly which definitely made us keep coming back for me and the mix of pork and beef sausage is a surprisingly good combo considering my being used to all beef. Wife said this was better than my normal recipe so I guess this one is now top of the list.  The only con is the beer and bouillon cubes which isn't something I normally have onhand. This recipe may not win you an award as it has others but it should definitely win you clean bowls!

We love this chili!  I did one pound ground chuck, one pound italian sausage, and one pound diced steak (stew meat).  I used 1/2 cup of real bacon, crumbled.  I reduced some of the pepper and hot sauce.  I only used 1 or 2 cans of mild beans plus one can of the spicy.  I only used 3 (14oz) cans of diced tomato.  My husband said it's the best chili he's ever had.  Makes the time it takes to make it all worth it!

Although the recipe doesn't give you the number of servings, I've determined it makes 18 cups.  This recipe has been enjoyed by my family several times.  I recently made this recipe kid friendly, without the chili powder, hot sauce or cayenne pepper.  It was still delicious.  Made it for 130 people at a soup kitchen.  It was a huge hit.

This is great Chili. I used a full bottle of strong ipa beer and substituted hot Italian sausage fried and cut into rounds as I didn't have the other. I also didn't have the green chilies so I added extra cayenne. All in all, delicious. Great recipe!

This is my husband and I's go to recipe for chili, we make it several times throughout the fall and winter... AMAZING! We sometimes make a double batch (which is a huge amount) and we freeze over half of it... Makes for easy week night dinners when you aren't wanting to cook!

This Chili here is very close to an exact recipie Ive came along with. By years of tweaking amounts of the different herbs salts. Kind of tomatoes spice used for heat is different as is the use of hot sauce itself. I use dried ted pepper flakes.  And i do not use much at all. Mine picks up a mild heat off your Chili pwd and smokey Paprika. I always leave the opportunities to add heat to it by having  along the side.  But  this  im going to say ss it stands? A great pot of Chili!!  Just a bit too much heat for my taste
To me Chili doesnt need to be spicy , it does need the southwest flavors cumin chili pwd etc though!
Hence my four stars

I made this almost exactly as it was written except I didn't have chili beans, and substituted red kidney beans.  I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of Liquid Smoke for that outside cooked flavor, and also added 2 tablespoons of package chili flavoring for additional flavor.  It was very tasty, but when I asked my husband to rate it, he said it was one of the top five he has had... not the best.  So, I might add another pound of sausage next time and try the chili beans vs the kidney beans.  Also, I didn't wait overnight as many of the previous cooks had suggested.  Better luck next time - back to the stove !

This chili is the best!!! I made it exactly how it is and it's totally perfect!! My whole family, including my three-year-old twin boys, love it! One batch is great for a dinner, a lunch the next day and enough for a freezer dinner tooI! Definitely use the Fritos! Awesome addition! And a dab of sour cream on top cuts the heat just enough for the kiddos!

I’m gonna tell ya, this is the absolute best recipe!!! I used it at least 4 times. Each time I add something else! I put in 1 whole Habanero, and Serano and Jalapeño. Also fryed 6/7 pieces of bacon, sautéed all veggies in bacon grease!! Killer!!!!

One change. Take the peppers, onion, celery and run them through  your blender till very fine diced.  Adds a lot of flavor plus saves a lot of Dicing? Great tasting chili.

The only change I made to this the first time, was to use ginger-ale instead of beer as I had no beer in the house. to this the first time and it was a huge hit with both my family (all big boys) and co-workers.

The second time i made it, I first sauteed the vegetables in just a little bit of pork fat (bacon grease) in the pot i was using, then cooked the meat in it and then added 1 Cup of Dr. Pepper and boiled that down by half before adding everything else. Another huge hit with my family and at a potluck. I doubled the recipe the 3rd time and froze containers of it for quick dinners throughout winter.

I've made this one about 20 times now and it never fails to impress my family and guests. This time I switched it up a little and threw a pound of bacon into the grinder with a 2lb flank steak and browned it all with the sausage, then added all of the chopped veggies for a big saute. Then I added all of the tomatos and beans (of which I used black, chili, spicy chili, great northern, pintos, and kidneys).  Simmered over night, froze it in a cryo bag, took it camping and reheated in boiling water. Served over Fritos with shredded cheddar and Greek yogurt on top.

Probably the best one yet. I credit the extra bacon.

Delicious! I split the recipe in 2 and made one batch in the crockpot with all the ingredients, and one batch on the stovetop without the spicy ingredients for myself and our 2 year old. My husband loved this chili! He ate it for 5 days in a row. Recipe definitely makes a large quantity, great if you have guests, or can freeze half! Will be making again soon!

Big hit with the family!  Used red wine instead of beer and it really gave it some body.  Served over white jasmine rice with a piece of ripe avocado.

So yum!

I used chorizo, added some salsa as that was on hand on a snowy day.  Did one jalepeno with seeds the other without.  Left out the green pepper and added fire roasted red/orange.  Not crazy about beans so this was all meat instead.  Added real bacon with the other meat.  Delicious and still eating leftovers.  A keeper!

This was excellent! I followed the recipe as is, but I did use one chili pepper instead of two (I was concerned it would be too spicy). It turned out perfectly! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this and it was very tasty! I didn't have cumin and didn't use peppers so that it wasn't too spicy for the kids and no bacon because we don't eat pork. I was very pleasantly surprised at the flavorfulness. I will make it again!

I am SO glad I came across this recipe it is wonderful just as it is.... however I prefer more veggies to meat.  I have made this SEVERAL times and I have done a few different variations.  My favorite so far includes changing the meat to only 1 lb of the leanest ground beef (that is the only meat I include in mine), using 1 can of pinto beans, 1 can of Kidney beans, 1 can of black beans, 2 med red peppers, 2 med green peppers, 5 celery stalks, 6 carrots.... I also like to use crackers, cheddar cheese, and quite a few dashes of tabasco.... DELICIOUS!!

Thank you for this  great recipe!  I have made this a couple of times and people always love it!  I always use sausage, but have varied the other meat (with Venison or Ground Chuck.) as well as the bean (I like color), leave out the beer,  and  add chipotle pepper for a deelish smokiness...

This is a fantastic recipe. I left out the sausage, chili peppers, bacon, and beef bouillon because I didn't have any on hand and it still tasted amazing. I also cut back on some of the spicy ingredients like chili powder and cayenne pepper but some people still thought it was too spicy, so be warned. The only other change I made to the ingredients was caramelizing the chopped onion before adding it to the pot. Lastly I cooked it in a pressure cooker for 30 minutes.

WOW! Best Chili I ever made. Made this recipe for the whole family. Did not include the Cayenne Pepper or add the hot pepper, but substituted with HOT Sausage. Only a few dashes of Tabasco, a dash of Crushed Red Pepper and added fresh Garlic. Also included a must have for me with any chili, McCormick 'Tex Mex' Chili mix. My 4 year old even loved it and said it was NOT too spicy; ate the whole bowl. Big hit and a big Thanks to MIGHTYPURDUE22!!!

Spiced it up a bit, extra hot peppers leave seeds in....It was excellent. I do not think you need all the stuff listed,  just cook it for a few hours it is very good.

Loved everything except wasn't hot enough for me. I made it first time using two jalapeños and was very mild. So the next time i made this I used two habaneros instead along with some hotter Texas Pete and mich better. This chili is delicious, and makes a ton of food. I guess since I changed it little bit and made it more spicy I will call my version the Florida State Seminoles Chilli !

This is exceptional chili! It takes a little time to prepare, but is SO worth it. I've made it twice now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious. The second time, I made a few small changes based on ingredients I had in the house. I substituted Andouille sausage for the Italian sausage, and instead of chopping up the spicy green peppers, I added a can of medium heat chopped green chili peppers. It was awesome the second time, too.  I'm a Minnesota Golden Gopher, but I'll be making Boilermaker chili from now on!

I'm not a big chili eater but I had two bowls, it was yummy!!! I did omit the hot stuff so the kids would eat it and I did add 1 1/2packets of chili mix and a little more of the spices they called for but I think that's what made it great

Really yummy! I love tomatoes so I used 2cans of diced and one can of tomato halves. I didn't drain all of the bean cans. Maybe I'm plain, but I actually liked the tomato based flavor better (I tasted while I cooked) than the finished product. It was perfect before I added in all of the spices. I didn't know exactly what constituted as a chili pepper (don't judge me) and there wasn't one labeled as such in the store so I didn't use peppers but did add extra sriracha and a spicy chili garlic sauce instead. Overall it was good and the smell of the Italian sausage cooking had everyone in the house wandering to the kitchen!

Thank you for submitting a very descriptive recipe (drained v. undrained, etc.). Awesome.  I cheated out of necessity to those reviewers who oohed about the lengthy ingredient list:
- habanero rotel (2 cans) in lieu of 1 ea (28 oz) diced tomato and the 1 cans of spicy chili beans.   
- diced tomato with garlic (in lieu of minced garlic)
- extra cumin in lieu of celery

#No leftovers.  Making AGAIN for a Packer game this next weekend.

My first thought was "Da@#, that's good chili!" Then my husband tried it and he said, "Da@#, that's good chili!". Seeing as how we've been together over 20 years, we often think alike... The kids still said "Blech, what stinks?", but at 5 & 7, food connesuires they are not so we ignored them. I made this exactly as written and it doesn't need a tweak. It has a really deep flavor without being "fusiony" or sweet. Just really great, honest chili. I don't use bouillon cubes, so used 4 tsp. Better Than Bouillon and diced up 2 serranos since "green chiles" leaves an open interpretation. I also couldn't find chili beans without sauce, so just used 4 undrained cans of medium spicy beans. Watch the oz. directed on the diced tomatoes, i had to add extra later since I assumed regular 15 oz. cans were called for when it should be 28 oz. cans. This one's officially in The Book! Oh, and you'll need a HUGE pot. It nearly rimmed my 7 qt. Dutch oven pot and the leftovers freeze beautifully.

I made teeny hanged because I didn't have a spice. It was PERFECT! I subbed a Cajun seasoning for paprika and one of the spicy pepper seasonings (1T total), I added 12 ounces of beer to the 1/2 cup it called for because I was worried there wasn't enough fluid in the chili to make it in the crock pot, and I used saracha hot sauce instead of tobacco. It hashtag without taking away the flavor of the chili. Oh, we also dislike chili powder, so I only used 1T and it was perfect. I did use two 12 oz packages of sausage and 2 lbs of ground beef o my because I didn't want partial packages of raw meat... This chili was made for a welcome home party, and I can't wait to make it again!

Chili is delicious and is a big hit whenever I serve it.  Only downside is it always seems to burn on the bottom of the pot no matter how often I stir it.  Takes a lot of elbow grease and a wire brush to remove.

Ok so I tweaked this a little but majority of what I did stayed true to the recipe. First I used cubed stew beef that I cut into smaller chunks instead of the ground beef. I then seasoned them well and set aside while I prepped everything else. I combined all the spices together in a bowl so I didn't have to do it while I was cooking. I didn't have beer so I just made a strong beef stock by using korrs concentrated beef stock in 3 cups of water and adding 3 of the beef bouillon cubes (the other was crushed into the seasoning mix that i combined in a bowl). I had a ton of canned beans so I used those instead of chili beans. So I used kidney, black, pinto, and white beans. I also used two different types of diced tomatoes. I used one that had oregano and basil in it and another that had green chili's. I still chopped pabalno and jalapenos into the chili so it had a little kick but not too bad. Lastly I followed the advise of other reviews and did a 2 day cooking process. I cooked via stove top the day before for about an hour then transfered it to my crock pot insert and chilled. Then the following day I cooked it on low for 6 hours and let it sit for awhile before dinner. It came out so yummy. It was a bit of a process but worth it. My sister said it reminded her of Wendy's chili. Not sure if that's a good thing or not lol but all in all will be keeping this recipe. Hope the tweaks help out any others.

I’ve made this chili with a few changes. Slow cooker to start. I use sweet onions and sweet Italian sausage. Also I use hunt’s diced tomatoes that come seasoned chili style (tried the seasoned basil garlic and oregano it worked well). Both turned out great. I like to season my meat while browning (just me???????). I’ve won two work cookoffs. Family and friends know once the weather cools I love making imthis and they always welcome to a bowl!

I have made this recipe several times and people LOVE it!  The only change I make is omitting the colored peppers.  I'm not a fan of green, red or yellow peppers.  Other than that, it's pretty much the same.

I simply added 1 Tsp Balsamic vinegar and a cup of red wine to help "marry" the flavors a bit more is all.

This recipe is wonderful - it has great depth of flavor. It is labor intensive, so have your significant other on chopping duty!  Only word of caution is that it is quite spicy, so for people with milder palates, you will want to decrease the cayenne to taste.

It was okay.....needed more spicing up and I did not want to use bacon bits personally. I used regular kidney beans without the sauce, beef broth instead of cubes and a lot more tobasco! Try to use fresh tomatoes if you can.

Made this the day before a family get together and reheated it--everyone loved it. My only deviations: I substituted turkey for the ground beef, used real bacon, chopped, rather than bacon bits and left out the added salt. 
My only complaints is that it was still a little on the salty side. I'll definitely make this again and double check that everything I use is low-sodium.

This is my go to chili recipe for a starting point, and have made it many times! I love being able to control the spices vs.just grabbing a salt ladened chili seasoning packet from the grocery store. The flavors are amazing together, and I love the addition of beer (I use a whole bottle), but you can adjust it to your taste - if you like it more spicy (which we do), add a bit more chili powder and/or hot sauce; if you like more beans, add more (we add black beans & red kidney beans); you can use what ever meat you like, but I like the hamburger/sausage combo, or use none at all; I typically add cilantro, but a lot of people don't like that flavor - the point is, this is a great recipe that you can adjust to your liking. Thank you for posting it!

Excellent chili recipe! I replaced the ground chuck with stewing beef cut to 1inch pieces and marinated for 24 hours in a Southwest Chipotle marinade. Cooking the chilli the day before serving is the way to go! Loved it!

I really like how hearty this turned out, but I did make a few changes: I soaked and cooked my own beans instead of using canned, I switched the tomato paste for tomato sauce, and I took out anything Italian (sausage, basil) because I just don't think it goes with the Mexican spices. It was a hit!

Made it as written except in a slow cooker overnight on low, getting up twice to stir.  It took first prize among 12 contestants.  It won pretty easily, with most of the votes coming my way.  Definitely worth making.  Very delicious.

Great flavor, great depth. We went with hot Italian Sausage and Ground turkey meat. The chili was pretty thick for my taste so I added roughly two cups (or to your likeness) of low sodium low-sodium beef broth. Instead of chili pepper I deveined and deseeded one jalapeño pepper. I'm not a spicy person and found with my minor adjustments and even after adding the additional beef broth without adjusting the seasonings it had a perfect spice level; just minor bite of spice. Very very delicious and will make this several more times in the future. Thanks for sharing!!

Best chili recipe! Tons of compliments (and even a trophy) when I make it.  I do like to add stew meat in place of half the ground beef.

This is the best chili recipe that I've ever made. I made a few minor tweaks to the recipe to add some spice. First, I used a spicy italian sausage. I couldn't find green chiles, so I added a few jalapenos and habaneros to get some spicy peppers into the mix.

It is always  a hit when I whip up a batch... It is one of the best chili recipes I have run across. Sometimes I cook it as is and sometimes I use it as a base with my additions of smoked peppers and different beans and the heat and sometimes I add a little mesa to thicken it... but this recipe as is great and very flexible... now I need to create vacuum sealed bags for the freezer :)

This is the recipe i've been building off of for years.  I don't bother using beef boulion or bacon because it doesn't seem to matter.  The biggest thing is the dried ingredients need to be as fresh as possible.   Also the meat needs to be high quality, which may seem counterintuitive when you're making chili, but it makes all the difference.  I use a short rib/brisket/chuck blend.  

I've messed around with the liquid content quite a bit until I'm happy with it.  Sometimes I use more tomato, sometimes I use half the beans drained half not.  The sweet peppers and garlic and celery are totally worth the extra prep time.  

It all sounds really basic but no joke I've been tweaking mine for 5 years.  This is just the base recipe.

Absolutely yummy! I do not care for anything more than mild spice, therefore I omitted the Tabasco. It was still a tad too spicy for me so I added a Tbsp of brown sugar and bumped up the DARK beer to a cup. I also used beef stew meat, cut into nickel sized pieces, instead of ground beef. Didn't have bacon so I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika. Was a good substitution. We all enjoyed it! Will make again.

This Chili was out of this world!!! I used 3 ponds of browned stew meat and 2 pounds of ground beef and 1 pound of spicy italian sausage. I only browned the stew meat then added it to the chili and allowed it to finish cooking on low.  This was a hearty, meaty chili.  Yes, there are a lot of ingredients, but well worth it.  I mixed all of my dry spices together, in one bowl, this allowed me to ensure that II didn't miss any of the required spices. BTW, it yields about 8-10 quarts of chili. You gotta try it!!

This was very good!  I added a little more salt than called for and did not use the hot sauce.  This also made a TON of chili - great for a crowd but too much for just two of us.  Would love to find a similar recipe that serves fewer.

Great chili....very hearty.  I added a couple of jalapenos (we are from Texas and like our food spicier than most).  Nice meld of spices and flavors.  A few more steps than my usual chili, but worth it.  This is now my 'go to' recipe for chili!

A few adjustments and substitutions: 1 lb spicy Italian sausage, 3 15oz can medium spice chilli beans NOT drained, 2 14.5 oz diced tomatoes in juice, 1 14.5 diced tomatoes in oregano with juice, 1 bottle Alaskan amber beer, 1 tsp brown sugar.  Cooked on the hob for 1 hr, refrigerated overnight, then kept on warm on the crock pot for 6 hrs. Best chili I ever made, delish!!!This makes for a huge batch, I ended cooking in two pots.

Absolutely delicious and everyone raved about this chili! I made some minor variations simply because I didn't have some of the ingredients but I don't think it made any difference to the overall flavor. This will be my go to chili recipe from now on without a doubt.

Used hamburger instead of chuck steak, other than that stuck with the recipe.  Very well received at work for our once a month lunches.    Too good as they keep pestering me to make again, even though its not my  turn yet.

Have to agree with others, this is the best chili I've ever made.  Note to others, if you want to use a slow cooker, this will nearly overflow a 7qt.  Best to use an 8.   I made over 7 gallons of this chili for a church function.   Made it as written, no need to change perfection. People loved it and wanted to take home any leftovers. Definitely a crowd pleaser.   Just enough spice to let you know it's there but not so much for those who don't like it overly spicy.

Made it for my boyfriend and he loved it. The only thing I left out with the onions just because he won't eat them.  Next time I might just do the same thing as my mom when she cooks for her husband and puree the onions so he can tell they're in there.  I also used Anaheim peppers instead of the Chili Peppers just because I couldn't find any and added crushed red pepper flakes for more heat.

Awesome recipe, I combined it with the Slow Cooker Chili II recipe. Will definitely make again. 

I sauteed my vegetables with the meat when it was close to done and added the seasoning while frying to try and set the flavor all together. 

Loved it for my first attempt at cooking chili!

This is a very solid chili.  I followed the directions exactly but my kids were not crazy about the chunky vegetables.  The second time I made it, I changed the recipe slightly, and everyone really loved it.  I added an extra LB of ground beef, I used a full beer (it calls for 1/4 cup and I used Guinness)  I also added a 1/4 cup unsweetened coco powder, and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also pureed all of the tomatoes, peppers, onions, and celery before I added it to the pot.  The only chunks were from the meat and the beans and the whole family loved it.  It did increase the spice level a bit so If you want less spice, you may want to use only one Jalapeno instead of two, and back off of the chili powder a bit.  Enjoy!

This chili is always a big hit! I do add my own twist, no salt and I add a can of Rotel Original Tomatoes too. We always get rave reviews... it has a lot of ingredients, but well worth the efforts. We also cook the veggies while browning the meats.

My husband loved it, I did only go with a few tablespoons of chili powder and sweet Italian sausage crumbled instead of spicy sausage to offset the spiciness and it was perfect!

I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted the sausage and beef with vegetarian versions in the same quantities. It was delicious. Well worth the time to add all those ingredients.  It makes for a more complex taste.

I have made this recipe a dozen times and have tried small changes from the original recipe. The two major changes that have gotten the most raves. 1) hot Italian sausage and 2) 1 teaspoon dried sage. I have also served over spaghetti noodles for a different presentation. It is hard to beat the original recipe though.

The BEST chile recipe! The entire family loves PBC. I adjust slightly here and there, primarily to reduce the heat, but mainly stick to the basic recipe.

Let me first say that I have never used Italian sausage in this or any other chili recipe. I usually cut all of the ingredients in half & the result is a very flavorful chili!! People rave about this chili. I have made this recipe multiple times & it always turns out great. It also freezes well.

Slight variations but all in all, I follows this recipe to bring one of the best chili I had eaten. I started off with 8 slices of cut up bacon to sauté my onions as the base. I also substituted 1/2 the ground beef with turkey and mixed up some different beans that I like. Superior chili recipe!

I used stew beef instead of ground beef and cut the recipe in half. It was great and everyone I shared it with loved it. It was a little spicy but that's what I wanted. Can't wait to make it again.

This chili is fantastic.  I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers and put this all together, let it refrigerate overnight, and then I cooked it in the crockpot the following day.  I used chicken broth instead of beer, and I sauteed the onions in a tiny bit of the grease from cooking the meat. The flavor is excellent.  My husband and I would've liked it a little spicier but this was just about right for the kids.

I made this for my husband as I don't like beans.  This was my first time making Chile.  I got a rave review from him.  I then shared it with my parents , daughter and family.  They also raved. So-o-o I bit the bullet and picked out the beans and tasted a little.  It was great.  Will make this again.
Thank you for a a great recipe.

Made this for a chili cook-off contest at work and won!!

Didn't do the sausage or bacon bits, and replaced 8 ounces of water for the beer; other than that followed instructions and was very easy to make.

Topped with jalapeno pepper cheddar cheese and crushed corn tortillas.

I will be making this recipe again.  I adjusted the heat knowing our tastes.  Only two green chili and a sprinkling of cayenne.  Happen to have a bottle of Bennett Chili sauce so I used that instead of chili powder.  Cooked up ground chuck, ground sirloin and sausage; added veggies to pot, dumped it in crock pot on low for the day with the rest of the ingredients.  Service for 12 in a large crock pot.  7 people ate most of it.  Wouldn't have been enough for 12 as everyone went back for 2nds and 3rds.  Thanks

I've been making this Chili for years for the day after Thanksgiving!  I mix fresh aneheim and poblano peppers.  I double it for my large group and serve it with elbow macaroni, cheese and Fritos!  It's a great recipe!

I have made this recipe several times and love it. The last time I made it I found a mistake between the ingredients and the instructions, however, I follow the ingredients list. I will adjust the hotness depending on what I am making it for. This is the only chili I will make now.

This chili won me  first prize on a chili cook off. Be warned, it is hot, but honestly the best I have ever had. The few things I tailored to my liking were: no Italian sausage celery, cheese, or Fritos, broth instead of beer, real bacon instead of bits, and I added sour cream and cilantro. Thank you for the recipe! :)

I've used this recipe three times in a company-sponsored chili cook off and won twice. Yes, it's made with can goods (beans and tomatoes) but if you buy a good quality canned item (Red Gold, Luck's, or Bush's), it's really not horrible. I do tweak the recipe a bit – from the recipe, I use Serrano peppers with seeds, hot Italian sausage, actually fry a pound of good quality bacon (chopping it up and using the entire pound), and Shiner Bock beer. I also add a pack of Aidell’s andouille sausage. I know you are thinking…holy cow at the protein, but the crisp bacon and andouille sausage adds texture and flavor. I actually crock pot the chili and prepare it two nights before the competition. After mixing, I crock it on low for about 4 hours – stir occasionally. After cooking, it rests in the refrigerator on day two and I bring it to work the morning of the competition and heat it on low/simmer for about four hours. I like to say this recipe with my tweaks offer the taste buds a residual spicy heat.

The first chili that I have ever made and we took third place in our Rotary club chili cook-off. Many many positive comments. A lot of people came back over and over to "taste" again!

entered my first chilli contest and won first prize. The only change I made was to add two tablespoons of 70% cacao chocolate instead of the sugar.

Did not add bell peppers. Used stew chuck instead of ground. Also used a Louisiana smoked sausage. 
Chili was delicious!  Definitely make this again!
Just enough heat with no or little lingering pain. :)

Delicious!. Tied for chili cook-off then won the taste off. My husband suggested not browning or overcooking the meat. All ingredients cooked med-high for 2 hours then slow cooked couple of hours. Omitted celery and green chili peppers. Used ground beef instead of chuck and about 1/4 pound more of Italian sausage. Dark brown sugar instead of white. Guinness stout for the beer. At the last minute decided on a bit of Saigon Cinnamon from Costco. Savory, rich and very yummy! So worth the time and effort.

Awesome chili. I modified the recipe to my tastes by cutting the beans and tomato in half, eliminating the bacon bits, and omitting the hot sauce for my family's dietary needs. I also used a cup of unsalted beef stock instead of bouillon, 1 cup of water,  and an entire 16 oz beer. The amount of liquid was perfect. So flavorful and perfect for game days! Garnished with mild cheddar, sour cream and green onions.

Fantastic!!  I won 1st prize in a chili cook-off against 15 other chilis!!   Made some very slight modifications, based on what I had on hand. I used 1/2 amount regular paprika and 1/2 smoked paprika and used 3/4 can of green chili's, instead of fresh..Also used fire roasted red peppers and diced tomatoes.   I made the chili the night before in a crock pot and left on warm overnight.  I planned on adding the beer and REAL bacon in the morning,  after I could get a better sense for the taste and choose the right beer.   The chili was PERFECT as is and I didn't want to mess with perfection,  so I omitted  the beer and bacon, entirely. I will try adding these vital ingredients next time when I'm not being judged,  however, I liked the consistency without the half cup of beer....I'm afraid it might be too watery with any more liquid.  This chili was a WINNING HIT!! Thank you!

I read the reviews and loved the contrast of 'too many ingredients' to 'not authentic because of the canned items'  I say to those people, if the ingredient list is too long, open the chili envelopes they sell in the store for seasonings and if want to dice tomatoes and soak your beans, have at it.  For everyone else, this recipe was delicious! I found it easy to make and loved the  seasoning . This is my new chili recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it!

May all time favorite recipe! My family devours this chili when I make it. Of course, I've made it my own by adding steak and REAL bacon to it. I add a full bottle of Guinness beer, jalapeño peppers, extra chili powder, black beans, kidney beans. I serve it  topped off with cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream, and Fritos. Even my chef mother tells me it's the best chili she has ever tasted, even better than her own! Now THATS a compliment!

I was looking for a hearty chili recipe with a kick. This is definitely it!  It was so good that husband actually asked me to pack him some for lunch the next day, he NEVER eats leftovers. I made a half batch but used the 1/2 can of beer (Guinness). It was a little liquidy so I will half the beer next time as well. Otherwise, my new go-to chili!

This is a great chili recipe! I followed it for the most part. I didn't have tobasco, but had some Sauce that apparently is very hot, so I used 1 tsp instead of 2. The chili had just enough of a bite, but not so much that it was uncomfortable to eat. After browning the meat and veggies, I threw it all in the crockpot for the day, and ate the next day.

I didn't have to make many alterations. I just swapped the regular chillies with a habanero pepper, reduced the chilli powder by 1 tbsp and nix'd the bacon. It tasted great.

This is my go to chili recipe.   But I do a few things differently.  I don't use the sausage as to me it doesn't add much.  I use a full can of beer and I use 2 extra cans of beans of whatever is on sale.  This is a healthy recipe to do in a budget and it lasts many meals.

I changed the white sugar to dark brown sugar.
I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.
I added an extra 2 table spoons of chili powder.
I added 1 large Japaleno  pepper.
I used two banana peppers instead of chili peppers.
I reserved the liquid from the chili beans (small red beans) and added most of it.
I ground my own chuck roast since I could not fine ground chuck in the grocery store. I used a coarse grind / chili grind.

I've made this chili over and over again.  I make this recipe exactly as directed and get rave reviews every time!!  My family loves it including the little 'kick' that comes from the peppers.   Add a pound of bacon directly the chili...more delicious!

Excellent! I added leftover flank steak instead  of the Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand. It came out fantastic! I omitted most of the spiciness because of kids and it still came out very tasty.

Although we had to improvise a bit based on what we had available, it turned out excellent. A three-year-old family member said it is their favorite meal, which makes it a winner for us.

I get a ton of compliments every time I make this dish. I use 2 Serrano peppers vs. green chilies. No other changes. It's perfect and delish.

I've made this chili multiple times and my family loves it! In fact, my husband and I went out of town recently, and my son called me for the recipe. He said he wanted to make it "just like mine". I only made the following two changes: I use ground beef and I cook it in the crock pot for about 6 hours.

Fabulous chili recipe! My only change,  I omit  the celery and add jalapenos.  Serve with a little sour cream and cornbread and your tummy will be happy.

I love this recipe.  I couldn't follow exactly this time, but pretty  close. I was missing some items so just substituted for spices, etc. that were close.  It has great heat and nice flavor.  Highly recommend. A perfect pair would be come yummy corn bread.

Excellent! Was looking for a recipe to kick my own up a notch. Was happy to find all the same base ingredients as my own recipe. I toned down the spice to make it kid friendly (no Tabasco or chile peppers), didn't have wish

This is a great chili recipe and, like most reviewers, I modified it. I replaced the beef bullion with 1 cup of beef broth, replaced chili peppers with 1 poblano pepper, used turkey bacon, no spicy chili beans, no jalapeño pepper (video) and used nearly a full cup of amber beer. After 4 hours on low in the crockpot it tasted great - could taste the blend of spices and the veggies didn't turn mushy. I'll definitely be using this recipe for an upcoming chili cook off at work!

Quite possibly the best chili I've ever tasted! I left out the beans to make it low carb (did not skip the beer). Hearty and spicy and delicious!

Excellent! My husband wanted an actual measurable recipe that used the spices he uses - this came the closest so he tried it. He loved it, said it was even better than his. Does not come out too spicy. If you like it hot, you will need to add more peppers to your liking.

Made exactly as listed except put in slow cooker for 10 hours while I was at work. Tasted great. Only 2 of us, so put most of it up in freezer (vacuum sealed) for colder months. Still in 90's where I live.

I've made this 5+ times.  It's now my "go-to" chili and an excellent, full-bodied chili recipe.   I use brown sugar instead of white - just my preference for cooking.
This is a family favourite for us.

Delicious! I also added mushrooms and chickpeas. Used Cajun sunshine hot sauce and used chipotle BBQ beans and half a can of kidney beans. Would add the whole kidney beans next time and perhaps even corn too! So tasty and so spicy. Delicious.

I typically make chili without a recipe, but decided to give this a try since the reviews were so outstanding. It didn't disappoint! I used a milk stout beer, which I think added to the dimension of flavor. Don't let the list of ingredients scare you off. You'll do 15 minute of chopping and the rest is easy-peasy. LOVED the addition of sausage to chili...why didn't I think of that before?! I thought this was the perfect amount of heat, but could see how it could be a little too spicy for other people.

This recipe is delicious! Of course it makes a huge pot, you can tell by the list of ingredients and they mention it's what the "GANG" eats at tailgating. Who wouldn't make a big batch for tailgating?  It really isn't all that time consuming. We ate it just after 2 hours of cooking and I'm so looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow.The only change I made was making half of the recipe and the bacon!  We cooked and crumbled some fresh bacon because I don't use bacon bits.

Best chili I've ever made. More depth of flavor dur to all the vegetables. Go easy on extra hot sauce, cayenne until you taste it.  Had a good laugh when a reviewer didn't have a boilermaker to she used a slow cooker!

When you make this you will think that’s way too much chili. I can promise you none of it will go to waste. If you have the extra time let it simmer on the smoker stirring occasionally. People will pay you to make it again

Love, Love this chili. I skipped the Italian Sausage (there's a lot of meat already - and I'm not a big fan of Italian Sausage) and went light on the chili powder and hot sauce (for the kids). It was great! 

I recommend this recipe and will be making it again.

I made this last night for a chili cook off today. I let it cook all night and day until 3:00 pm.  I've only made chili a few times  and I took 2nd place!  I cut back on the heat. No chili peppers but a few tiny pieces of a serrano, only a few shakes of Tabasco and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. I didn't realize it was a 1/4 cup of chili powder so I only add 1/4 teaspoon. Will add a tablespoon next time.  Didn't have bullion so i didn't add it.  I added liquid smoke as a nice surprise - maybe a tablespoon or a little less.  I cooked on low for a long time so all the flavors melded  together. Loved this! I had it for breakfast and dinner. Dinner was better.

This is excellent chili! I made this for a potluck at my church and got compliments on it. This freezes well too. My son and his wife said it tastes even better  after heating up the frozen chili that I gave them.  Thank you MIGHTYPURDUE22 for this recipe.

I gave this a shot, made it in my cast iron Dutch oven. I used bison instead of beef and no sausage. It was one of most delicious meals I've made. Great combination of ingredients. Thanks to the chili gods.

I was in the kitchen probably for an hour prepping all the veggies and cooking the meat. It was a LABOR of LOVE that is for sure and you can tell in the taste. 
I will have to say this reading the recipe from the app I missed a few ingredients that could have played a major role in the taste profile. My suggestion would be to open/read through the website. 
1. I could not find chili beans in SPICY SAUCE. (I figured I can add spice to the recipe since I could not find in my local Stater Bros supermarket here in CA) 
2. I did not use cayenne pepper or paprika which I did not have nor did I see it on the app version of the recipe. 
3. I used fresh bacon that I cooked and crumbled into the meat mixture 
4. I used Tecate light for the beer. (I am sure that you can use any beer)
5. I added Cajun creole seasoning because I didn't have the cayenne or the paprika. 
6. I did cook the chili for 4 hours in total 
7. And it was quite expensive to make once you add the cost of ground beef, Italian sausage and canned items. 
8. I did not use a crockpot for this. I used a large deep round pan with a lid and cooked on low. 
9. BEWARE THIS MADE A LOT. I was shocked by the amount it made. 
10. My family really enjoyed this recipe. Everyone went back for seconds. I would suggest like others have said make the day  before and allow the flavors to blend more together. 
11.

Made this great chili just as the recipe told me to EXCEPT I didn't add the bacon (because I don't like bacon in things) and forgot the tomato paste.  That being said, I made it and kept it overnight before serving.  GOOD IDEA.  Then it was a little too thick so thinned it with 1 1/2 cups beef stock, 2 tablespoons chili powder and 1 tablespoon cumin, and simmered another hour and a half. PERFECT.  This recipe makes lots of chili, so now I have 3 containers in freezer for cold fall Sundays!

The only thing I did differently was not to add celery but it wasn't a deliberate choice. Don't be intimidated by the amount of ingredients, this really is a very easy recipe to put together, just remember to leave AT LEAST 2 hours for simmering. If you are super organized, make it the night before you plan to eat and then gently reheat, this way all the spices have plenty of time to get friendly with each other. I tried it the first night and thought it was ok, reheated for the fam the second night and was blown away.  I will use this recipe from now on, just perfect.

Loved it.  My wife and  children  loved it  too.  Made it according to the recipe.  I liked it better  the next day after the flavors  mixed in.  My son's friend liked it and his idea of  different is putting the jelly and then the peanut butter on the bread.

Absolutely delicious!!  Whenever  I try a new recipe I usually stick to their instructions and then tweak from there to my family's tastes.  BUT THIS does not need much tweaking at all!  Made this for the first time for my partner and his employees (small auto body shop) so I decided to tone down the heat a bit (served cayenne and Franks Hot Sauce on the side for those who like a little more kick) so that everyone can enjoy it..  

Only minor changes were:

1.  Green chilies substituted for one jalapeno; minced, seeded and spines removed.  

2.  I couldn't find "spicy chili beans" so I just used regular chili seasoned beans (seeing as I wanted to keep the heat to a small kick) and I reserved the sauce from the first 3 can of beans, in case the chili reduced too much and I needed to add some liquid (better than water!).

3.  I seasoned the meat with sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder when frying it.  The amounts are not not precise but rather by my own tastes.  

4.  I slightly sauteed the veggies in the pot (after draining the excess grease from the meat) then added the meat and tomato paste and let that cook a minute or two before adding the beans, tomatoes and seasonings.

5.  I also used "no salt added" whole canned tomatoes and crushed them by hand to reduce the salt content (salt can easily be added by the diner)  

Served with hot corn-on-the-cob, fresh soft sourdough buns and of course lots of butter! ;)

This recipe is perfect as written.  Due to my own mistakes and/ or preferences, I did not use  spicy beans because of my toddler, I did not have a red bell pepper, and I forgot to drain some of the beans.  Nevertheless, this recipe is another keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome. I add more beer. Also, I like to up the meat quantities and use real bacon...a lot of it. A touch of brown sugar is nice, and also a can of corn. Need a big pot or 2 crock pots

This is my go-to recipe for chili, and it always impresses. The one recommendation I have is to start with half of the chili powder, cayenne powder, and hot sauce. You can always increase later during cooking, but it is so hard to bring the heat down for sensitive palates.

This was probably some of the best chili I have ever had! I only used 1 lb of ground chuck and 1 lb of sausage, I felt like 3 lbs of meat would have been overkill.

This is my favorite chili recipe.  Have made many many times....I don't follow exactly and use whatever protein I have on hand...have used Gr. Beef, Chicken, Italian Sausage, cubed beef, cubed pork....it is delicious with all of them and even with a combo of all of them.  Try it, you will love it!

Fabulous! I'm no chili connoisseur, but I make it often and must say this is a great recipe and well worth the extra effort. It makes a big pot and thought I would have leftovers from a group of six guys Sunday get-together but just enough for two bowls leftover. I halved the chili powder though, and put out a couple of different hot sauces if they wanted to add a little more heat, but it was just spicy enough for me. I also used 1-1/2 lbs of ground beef and 1-1/2 lbs of hot Italian sausage. Rave reviews from the guys. This is a keeper!

I'm busy eating this as I type, very tasty chili, not overly spicy but if you aren't really into spicy you might want to cut out the spicier stuff like cayenne and hot sauce, it'll still be awesome without.  I'll definitely make it again and again

Fantastic recipe, though I have yet to make it the way it says. I've made it twice. I used a large can of tomato sauce (husband doesn't like chunky tomato), 2 seeded jalapenos in place of all the other peppers, and in place of the worcestershire sauce I used A-1 steak sauce bold n spicy with Tabasco sauce. I also used ground turkey, because that's what I had.  Also omitted the bacon bits, since we didn't have any. Can't wait to try it someday with! I added half a cup of brown sugar. We like a sweet chili. I also didn't use canned beans, but presoaked and cooked 1 lb pinto beans.

This recipe was excellent.  I do cook organic so it turned into a pretty expensive pot of chili but my husband loved it.  It had great flavor.

It is amazing. The only change I made was to reduce the spiciness a bit.

This chili tasted amazing all my family loved it. It was a little spicy for some so incase your not a fan of spicy things you might need to tweak it a little

This was a great turnout. I turned up the heat and threw a chopped habanero and 2 sliced jalapeños into the vegetable mix. Then I threw a whole pack of bacon in as well: half thrown in to cook with meat, half fried for crispness. The turn out was absolutely amazing and I will be making this again soon!!

Very tasty recipe. Sometimes I don't have celery and omit that and it still tastes great. As others have mentioned, the longer you let it simmer the better it tastes.

YUM!  I wanted something I could toss in a pot for a big crowd that would go well with grilled sausage.  The spicy was perfect, loved the peppers.  #1 Chili!  I did not change a thing, made it as is.  A double recipe feeds an army.

I have little kids so I was worried about too much heat, so I left out the hot sauce and hot pepper. Tasted just right, still had some heat, and was great with cornbread!!!!!!

Love making this chili. I like using soy chorizo instead of beef and add dried cherries to it to give it some added flare. A little sweet and tart to your savory salty hearty chili.

Slam Dunk! If you're like me, you're confused by the beef bullion. I thought perhaps they omitted the instruction to prepare the bullion (with 1 cup water) so I had 4 extra cups of water and it was too wet, but still yum. JUST DROP THE CUBES (or paste) INTO THE RECIPE! The only other thing I changed the 2nd time was 100% beef instead of sausage because I found the flavor of italian sausage outta place, so just go all beef and BAM! Totes perfect.

Outstanding! If you follow recipe as is, the heat is about a 2.5 star out of 5 for heat range. Taste range...6 out of 5! Absolutely the best chili ever had. Very generous of Purdue to share such a great recipe.

I made this yesterday for a get together of about 9 people and everyone loved it. Only used 2 cans of chili beans in medium chili sauce (1 drained, 1 not) as we aren't huge bean people and it was the perfect amount. We also added a small can of diced green chiles (not drained) instead of fresh green ones. But everything else was exactly as written, cooked in a Dutch oven on the stovetop. It came together quickly and I let it simmer for about 3 hours before serving over elbow macaroni with shredded cheddar and sour cream. Delicious! Relieved we have some leftover to enjoy again! Definitely a keeper.

I made this for a chili cook off competition at work... It turned out great! I didn't follow the recipe perfectly.... I basically chopped up all of the ingredients and added them to the cooked meat along with all the other seasonings and cooked it overnight in a crock pot. :) it's pretty spicy!

Excellent chili. Nice range of seasoning. Many chilis just add chili powder and cumin. The additional seasonings in this one really add a nice balance. Also, the consistency is excellent. Not overly thick, nor too watery.

For others trying this, If any of your tasters don't like it too hot, start off with about half the chili powder and tabasco called for in the recipe. Then add some additional after cooking it for awhile if you'd like it hotter. The full complement of spices does have a nice kick to it--not really hot mind you--but enough to pop and eyeball or two from folks who don't like it too spicy.

I have made this once before and it was awesome. This chili has great flavor and fills you up. I followed the recipe exact but added a DASH and I mean a DASH of Ghost pepper seasoning. I took it to work and there was nothing left to take home.  Got a lot of good reviews from my co-workers. I am making it again tonight but cutting the recipe in half and making Fry bread with it. 
Don't mind the bad review from Texas. This is by far way better then their watered down chili. WAY BETTR!!

I reduced the spice (cayenne and hot sauce) to ensure the family would enjoy it, though I would have liked the heat!  I also used my own bean selections, some kidney, mixed beans, and brown beans in place of the types suggested and it turned out great!  It was initially a bit more liquidy than I prefer, so simply let it simmer for an additional half hour without a lid and it was perfect.  Terrific flavour!

Great! Cooked as directions except forgot to buy the bell peppers which I'm sure would have been wonderful. Also didn't have a whole chili pepper but I added a can of diced chilies and a can of diced jalapeños. Would like to try it next time with fresh bacon as another reviewer had. Makes an absolute TON. After 2 days of eating chili, I still had two large containers for the freezer! Garnished w/ sour cream, shredded cheddar and a few dashes of hot sauce.

Made a triple batch for crowd tonight and it was a HUGE hit!
The flavor is just amazing - you get the Hot when you eat it, but it doesnt burn going down or linger.  Just great heated taste!  
For tripling I used 1lb ea mild, sweet & hot italian sausage, a  16oz beer, and  chipolte hot sauce.   Sauteed the onions & garlic in a little oil til clear, then added all the spices & sauces to the hot onion mixture for a few minutes before adding to the whole pot.   I made it the day before serving and let the flavors marry in fridge for 12 hours.   Cooked in roaster oven on high an hour, then low (200) for 6 hours.   I sealed the roaster with heavy foil entire time cooking and got a very juicy chili.  If you like it thicker I would just use lid or leave open last couple hours.  Will definitely make again!!

We really liked this. I added hot pepper seeds and topped it with grated cheese and sour cream.  My husband used to be the 'chili maker' in this house but now I will take over thanks to this recipe (I may have made a mistake, lol).

If you've never made chili and need a recipe THIS IS IT!!! I have never made chili from scratch before and when I was done with this recipe my family was raving about how good the chili was. My 2 year old son is picky about food and he ate three bowls! This chili is LIFE! Plus it only took 2 hours to cook! I was done before lunch time and it was perfect for dinner. I put it on rice and it pairs well with grilled cheese when you take out the chips. Whoever made this recipe THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT!!

Husband loves it, but would like it with more heat next time, so I think I'll add some habanero chile's instead of the green chile's. But, the flavor was lovely and married together beautifully. He could taste each individual ingredient. I also do not add red peppers either, but add a bit of Worcestershire sauce into it.

I added extra spices and hot pepper to suit my taste. I also noticed that some of the reviewers said it tasted to canned so I substituted the canned tomatoes for fresh ones.
I caramelized the onions and cooked the peppers and tomatoes in a skillet before adding them to the chili. 
I ate it with sweet cornbread so I decided to ditch the sugar.

This is by far the best chili recipe I've ever used.  I've been making it for a couple of years now (for both home and tailgate parties) and everyone who has tried it just loves it.  I prepare it "as is" - why mess with greatness?!  This also freezes well.  When I make this just for home it's a bit much for 2, so I make individual serving sizes with my food sealer and freeze.  Great to throw in our lunch boxes and heat up at work.

We have made this chili twice now - once for Superbowl (15 people - we made 1.5x the recipe and had leftovers) and once for meal prep (healthy version without sausage and less beef bouillon to minimize the salt).  Its a fantastic dish and we make it with double the green chilis as we like it spicy! Thanks for the great recipe!

I personally don't like chili.  But my husband does.  So, this is the third time I've made this recipe.  A lot of work, but they (hubby and his friends) say it's well worth my effort!  Too hot, as written, in my guys opinion....So I just shake in a little Tabasco til they say when!  And cut out the spicy beans (use only red kidney beans...no spices) and cut out the Chile peppers.   And it's absolutely true that it tastes better the second day.   Or the third day.  Or a week or more later!  I double batch and freeze individual containers for them, so it can be enjoyed for weeks.  If you're gonna spend all that time with all those ingredients, chopping, chopping, chopping.....you might as well do a double batch!  They love it!  Great recipe!

My new favorite chili! I used half the recipe and it was enough for 6-8 people.  Cooked in the crockpot.  Left out the tobasco, used half a jalapeño and only a dash of red pepper and it was just right.

This is the best chili I have ever had. I made a few changes according to what I had read in the reviews as well. First off, I used about 1.5 lbs ground beef, and 1 lb of pork sausage, and .5lb of turkey sausage. I also added pork sausage rounds. Instead of bacon bits, I cooked and chopped some of my own bacon. Instead of 2 chili peppers, I used 1 serrano pepper and added a anaheim pepper. I didn't add any tabasco or any hot sauce, and only drained 2 of the cans of bean, the others I just dumped in sauce and all. Instead of paprika, I used smoked paprika. Also added extra diced garlic. This is fantastic! Had a church chili cook off and out of the 17 chili's, after trying all of them, I had 2 bowls of my own because I really thought it tasted the best. I also added a full cup of beer instead of half cup. Fantastic chili and wasn't too spicy!

I've made this chili several times and everyone loves it.  I substitute ground buffalo and turkey sausage for a healthier recipe and I use GF beer.  It tastes exactly the same as the original recipe.

Yum. This was a great recipe for us. I used 1 lb. ground turkey (in place of the ground chuck) with the ground Italian sausage. Used only 2 cans of chili beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes...basically cut everything in half because I don't have a big crowd to feed. If you do, this is definitely the recipe to use! I also adjusted the spice to be suitable for an 8 year old but otherwise followed the recipe and we LOVED it. Made some cornbread with it and dinner was a hit. Thank you for this one!

Terrific chili.  I live in Texas so I don’t add beans but add an extra pound of ground beef. Also can be adapted to be Keto-friendly by deleting beans, sugar and beer.  I’ve made it about a half dozen times.  Really good.

I'm not a big chili fan but this I loved :). I made it as is and can't wait to make it again. The recipe is big and I had to use my slow cooker/crockpot as well as my largest pot to accommodate this recipe. I felt the leftovers froze well.

Made for Superbowl Sunday.  Had many compliments.  Was a little sweet after letting it sit overnight.  Added lemon juice and took care of the issue.  Next time, omitting the sugar.  It was delish.

This was really great!  I browned the meat in a large pot and then transferred everything to the crockpot.  This made a ton of chili so I will be able to freeze several smaller servings to have on busy weeknights.  Don't leave off the corn chips - they really add to the dish.

Followed the recipe as is and it was a total hit! The whole family absolutely loved it and couldn't believe it was my first time making it. Froze the leftovers into individual serving zip lock baggies and it tastes great days later!

Amazing! A really like it! I do not like beans, but I really wanted chili. So I replaced the beans by a can of corn. Served it with a spoonful of sour cream sitting on top. It is so good! Very warming dish for a cold winter day!

Delicious recipe!  Made a couple minor changes that add some more fire:
1) Sliced and pan-fried spicy Italian sausages.  Added them to the browned ground beef.
2) Used 4 finely chopped Indian chili peppers (instead of Jalapenos or other less spicy varieties).

I think this creates a perfect amount of heat paired with melted cheese and tortilla chips.

Will make again!

p.s. The chili thickens after sitting in the fridge for a night.  Don't be worried if it seems soupy right after cooking.

One of the best chilis ive ever had. I do wanna say to those who havent made it, not to be intimidated by the sheer number of ingredients. I thought it was gonna be harder than it was. I however did this all in a slow cooker besides browning the meat to make it easier on myself. Brown the meat and stick everything in a slow cooker for the time required. delicious and easy!

The flavor was terrific even when it had only simmered 30 minutes.  Family loved it too but it was extremely spicy.  Will definitely make again minus some spices.

Delicious!  I don't eat beef, so I made it with ground turkey and turkey italian sausage.  Other than that, the only change I made was to use 4 pieces of bacon (crumbled) and cook the onions and celery in the bacon grease for a few minutes.  My new favorite chili!

I made this for the very first time last year (2015) for a Super Bowl Chili Cook Off and I WON!!!!  First time out!!!  Everyone LOVED it and it's my husband's favorite. I'm actually making it tonight to take to a cookout tomorrow night. It tastes even better when you make it the night before and then put it in the slow cooker the next day and let it simmer. I've used a couple of different beers and they've all tasted great. The one I used for the cook off was a chocolate stout. Try it and you'll be able to taste for yourself how AMAZING it tastes!

Best. Chili. Ever.  Leave it to a Boilermaker to concoct the best batch of chili I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. You'll be scavenging your spice drawer or the spice aisle at the grocery store to come up with the lengthy laundry list of ingredients, but it's worth it!  Don't save this for a football Saturday. Go Boilers!

Being from Colorado, we usually eat green chili, but the family wanted some red chili for a change. This recipe made enough to feed 5 of us ( which includes 3 hungry teenagers) for two meals. I used my 8qt crock pot and let it simmer all day, and it was fantastic!

Brilliant chili. Everyone loved it. I was concerned about so little liquid and ended up keeping the juice from the drained beans and pouring it in. Came out perfect and everyone wants the recipe.  Also, I throw it all in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours, the flavours really marry up well in a slow cooker

I didn't ad sugar and I used red wine (merlot) instead of beer. I won my office chili cook-off with this and got many people emailing me asking me for the recipe afterwards!! It's truly delicious. I didn't mind that there was a long lsit of ingredients. Most is for flavouring which is necessary in chili. For the hot sauce, I used a few dots of tabasco.

Refrigerate and eat the next day should be a mandatory part of this recipe. Honestly, you can't go wrong with this one. You can easily substitute beer for chicken stock and the result will be about the same.

FYSA: You might need two crock pots for this recipe, so I always use the tool to cut it in half.

I am inclined to think simpler is better - let the individual components shine. I'm usually skeptical of recipes with lists of ingredients as long as my arm but I am happy to admit my skepticism was unfounded in this case. Absolutely delicious chili. I used my favorite Trappey's Jalapinto beans.

Thank you MightyPurdue22 for the awesome recipe! Made it yesterday for Superbowl and it was a big hit. I did make some changes to suit the family "preferences" with no celery or peppers added and reducing the spicyness with only 1 tbsp of chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, no hot pepper sauce (had it available on the side) 1/2 tsp cayenne added. Used 2 cans of chili beans (molasses and maple flavored), and added 1 can of kidney beans and 2 cups of frozen corn (2 hrs before serving time). I made the chili in the morning and transferred everything into a crock pot to simmer on low all day, stirring every hour or so.  So yummy!

I made this for a Super Bowl party today and everyone loved it!!!  I couldn't find chili beans in spicy sauce, so I just used four cans of regular chili beans, undrained.  (There wasn't much sauce in them.)  This will be my go-to chili from now on!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This receipts is excellant.  I fixed this for Super Bowl 50 and it was a hit.  I added a little more chili powder and I left the juice on one can of the Beans.   Perfecto.  Hell yeah I would make it again.

We loved this recipe.  I did add chunks of steak along with the ground beef and Italian sausage since we like a hearty chili.  I omitted the hot sauce as I felt that the recipe had enough heat in it for me.  I actually added sour cream to my bowl because it was a little too spicy.  I will definitely make this again, but will tone down the spice for me.

This was delicious... I add chipotle peppers for a spicy smoky flavor... I've been obsessed with them lately!

Great taste! This recipe doesn't need adjustments.
I took a chance and used a super spicy chili powder; little bell pepper chili which makes the taste very hot but very rich. The only bad thing about this chili is that it takes a lot of work and it's not that different from a simpler recipe.

Left out chile peppers and hot sauce, otherwise made as printed.  Still was moderately spicy. Has a nice complex flavor. Not boring at all. My daughter's school had a chili cook-off and I won!

I left out the green & red peppers because I just don't like'm. I also left out the tomato paste and used the spicy chili bean juice instead (didn't drain the beans), making it less tomato based.
This chili is full of so many flavors and just the right amount of heat. This recipe will sadly replace my old tried and true, go to chili I've been making most of my adult life.

I made this for my company chili cookoff based on the other reviews and won Best Tasting!!   I made 3 batches just to make sure I had enough.  I had so much left.  But, it was so good, that even some of my competitors asked to take some home!   Thanks for this great recipe.  It really is award winning!

I would DEFINITELY make this again. Took  a little longer to prep, but well worth it.!!! Excluded the cumin, and just eyed the measurements for spices. Took the "left overs" to work, and was gone within an hour BEST CHILI I EVER MADE =)

I've made a few changes when making this recipe: substituted chicken broth for beer, left out the cheese, substituted smoked paprika for paprika, substituted ground turkey for ground beef, and used any 4 cans of beans (chili or not). It is SO good, in fact it's the only chili we ever make!  I think the chili powder you use can really make a difference. Penzey's is excellent, and I would definitely recommend it.

This "Tailgate chili" was a-maiz-ing!  I had to drop off the boilermaker part as we are MICHIGAN fans! Did not change a thing....will make it again and again. Throwing out my old chili  reciepe.   Just note that it will require a full 6qt crock pot nothing less.

Made this for the Championship Football games party yesterday.  Made it on Saturday (during the blizzard), put in the crock pot Sunday morning and let simmer on low all day.  Everyone raved, said it was the one of the best chili they ever had.  I cut down on the spice, knowing that some of our guests can't eat spice.  Did not add the spicy beans, or chili pepper.  Reduced the amount Cayenne pepper, added a square of dark, unsweetened chocolate and about a tsp. of cinnamon.  Served with Sriracha and Frank's hot sauce on the side, if anyone wanted more heat.  Set up a fixings bar of raw, chopped onion, sour cream, Fritos, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and saltines. Yum!

The only thing I did different was add medium heat Herdez salsa instead of canned tomatoes otherwise it's GREAT! How can I NOT give it 5 stars when I do the altering. Oops, almost forgot...I Didn't have bouillon cubes so I used Knoors Beef Concentrated Pods(2) I halved the recipe and it still filled my 4qt crock. Make sure you drain the chili beans as it says in the recipe except the spicy can of Chili Beans. Use a decent beer, you get out of it what you put into it...just my 2 cents worth.

This is the best recipe I've found. I've probably made it about 10 times. 
My changes are:

I substitute 2 Lb of stew meat for the ground beef 
I use one serrano and one jalapeño instead of the 2 green chiles. 
I use both kidney chili beans and pinto chili beans. 

I always freeze about half in individual serving containers.

Excellent!  I was looking for a different recipe for chili and this one fit the bill.  This is a great version.  We don't get cold weather often in Florida and I love a good chili when it does and this fit the bill.

LOVE this recipe... been trying for years to get a good chili recipe. I halved the recipe and made some small changes. The spice combo was perfect. I forgot the tomato paste at the store, but still was good. I used Stone IPA India Pale Ale for the beer, and used a bit more than the recipe. I also put a1/4 a cup of coffee and a teaspoon of coco powder.  I took advice from reviewers and switched sugar with brown sugar and used 2 strips of bacon instead of bacon bit ( but recipe was halved) . Best chili I ever had . and I made it! The spice mix was what made it. Thank you for the recipe and all the reviews that helped me.

Awesome Chili!  Made for football playoff afternoon and it was just fantastic.  A bit spicy, I like it hot though, so if you like your chili a little more mild, then you might want to tone it down a bit.  My wife, brother-in-law, and I loved it!

Everyone who is bashing this recipe is only doing it to be different. Great recipe and I use this at the Fire House and everyone loved it.  Yeah it's a lot of ingredients but that's the joy of cooking. And in my opinion you can add whatever you want to it and still call it chili. Excellent recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. (Used Oktoberfest Beer in mine).

This chili is really good. I used real crumbled bacon instead of bacon bits (I love bacon), but I kept everything else the same. It's full of flavor and not too spicy. My daughter, who doesn't like chili, said it was vey good!

Delicious as is and feeds a crowd.  - Wondering if the beer was spilled into it at the first tailgate and added ever since.

This chili has amazing flavors. I added extra spices such as cayenne and basil.  The flavors work so well together and the italian sausage was a great idea. The only thing - it did take over an hour to prep and there were two of us cooking. Just keep that in mind. The time it takes to make this chili is definitely worth it. It's the best I've had. My five quart pot was too small. You will need a much larger pot for this. I had to use two 5 quarts and it turned out fine.

Don't make changes. Don't worry about it being to spicy. Just a great recipe. We also make it every Halloween to warm up the kids and guests. All who enter say oh just a small bowl probably to be polite, then they say, Oh, can I have another bowl. etc. and it's gone that night. Does make a large amount and will feed probably 8 - 10 people depending on guest size and event. Never has anyone complained or said things about the ingredient list. I even keep a photo of the recipe in my on my phone and text it because I got sick of trying to write it out for everyone.

While I am no chili connoisseur every time I make this recipe I get nothing but rave reviews. Make sure you use a large stock pot and bring an appetite cause this recipe makes a ton (great for leftovers as it tends to get better as the week goes on and it soaks up all the yummy flavors in your fridge)! I do switch up the meats sometimes using more pork than beef or sometimes doing a mix of beef, turkey, and beef (and more often than not get the spicy versions of them). I use real bacon (2-3 strips) cooked and chopped up instead of bacon bits. I also sub a couple jalpenos for one of the anaheim peppers. Adding an extra teaspoon or so of sugar really counterbalances the spiciness quite nicely. Also adding extra veggies helps and never hurts anyone. I still find it can be quite spicy but it doesn't seem to bother anyone else, though I live in the heartland of spicy food. I add more beer or broth as time goes on and sits on the stove and people dip into it and suck all the juices out of it, I find it hardly affects the flavor. Just the other evening I did a can of black, a can of white, and a can of kidney chili beans and I honestly think there is no going back! Other than that I follow it exactly and people love it! Yes it can be time consuming fishing out all the spices but it is so well worth it. Will be making this recipe every football season from here til eternity :)

It was SO hot but I couldn't stop eating it because it was SO delicious!
I use 2 cans of Rotel in place of the diced tomatoes and diced chiles.

God help me.... I have requests to make this now all the time during the winter!   It is fabulous!  Served it with sides of extra chopped onion, avocado, medium shredded cheeses, sour cream and corn/tortilla chips.  Never fails me or anyone who has tried a hot bowl of this with whatever extras or no extras added.

Turned out fantastic! Used ground turkey instead of beef and we also used Serrano chilies. We always top our chili with cheese and sour cream with a side of jalapeño corn bread!

delish! always a hit.  I make it with ground turkey only, red, yellow and green peppers, and two jalapeno peppers (this time)  was still fantastic. I also used 16 oz of tomato paste by accident, and i think it made it better!  Also I dont care for the acidity of tomato in sauces etc, so I doubled the sugar and used half brown sugar.  Doesnt really make it sweet, but it makes it kind of "neutral" as i call it.  Great Recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I cut back on the spiciness quite a bit for the company I had over which worked out well because everyone could eat it as well as add their own heat to their own with a little hot sauce.  Such a hit and made a ton! It's only been a couple weeks and I'm making again for a party because I'm craving it again! Thanks for the tasty recipe!

This was the bomb and won me first place at our office chili cook off!  I tweaked it, of course, to fit my taste:  no chili peppers, 2 cans of beans total, added a can of mild rotel, cooked bacon and crumbled some into the chili, cooked peppers celery and onion in bacon grease, used one red and one yellow bell pepper (I don't care for green).  I really liked all the different flavors.  Really awesome recipe!

This is a delicious and easy to make dish. I like to use a darker beer whenever I make this dish, preferably an IPA. Also instead of bacon bits I start my meat out by first slicing 4 strips of bacon and cooking them in the stock pot the chili will be made in. Cook the sliced bacon until the grease starts to render out, then put in the chuck and the sausage and brown till crumbled. Drain the grease and follow the rest of the recipe.

I just made this last night, and it was a huge hit. A few changes I made were to add 8 oz of grilled steak and I doubled the bacon. I also poured a whole Newcastle for my beer. I served it with cheese, sour cream, chopped fresh jalapeños, and fresh cilantro. I had no idea how much cilantro could make chili pop. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making chili. I am a Hormel in a Can kind of guy. I was jealous of my daughter-in-laws ability of making chili.... so I thought I would choose the one recipe with the highest ratings. After careful review of all the comments, I substituted the italian sausage for ground beef, and added 2 lbs of sliced skirt steak. Added on can of black pitted olives, and added 12 sliced fresh mushrooms. Added one can crushed pineapple to balance the spicy after taste. I used bulk pinto and red beans instead of the can beans. Requires another hour cook time to tenderize beans. The results|: I am so awesome.... I Rock!! Served over a bed of steamed rice. Thanks for the base recipe.

Great recipe! I've made it several times now and tweaked it here and there but it's always good. The last batch I made was by far the best. I started by smoking the meat and veggies on the Traeger with Mesquite pellets. This added a great new dimension to the already great flavors. I like it hot so I also added a couple of coarsely chopped Jalepenos seeds and all. I also use dark brown sugar as opposed to the white sugar the recipe called for and added a few ounces of good whiskey. Wow! My guests were all raving and begging for the recipe. This one is a keeper!

Doesn't need mods unless you are whimpy when it comes to spicy like me. Then only one jalapeño instead of two and still it has more than a kick of heat but not too much burn.  This recipe gets tons of praise everytime I make it!

We just made this (with some mild modifications) and it was the absolute best chili we've ever tasted.  We did 1 lb of ground beef, 2 ½ lbs of chuck cut into small cubes, and a small package of fresh cooked bacon that we chopped after cooking (rather than bacon bits). We also used pinto, kidney, and black chili beans. We sautéed the onions, peppers, and celery separately (so they wouldn't get that soggy taste), browned the meats separately, then added it in. And the first 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes was regular, the second was fire roasted with jalapeños. We didn't include beer. Seriously, this will be made for the next potluck we attend.

This chili has lots of ingredients but the processes are not complicated.  If you can con a family member into doing the chopping it's perfect!  You will need a BIG stockpot for this.  A 5qt Le Cru dutch oven was no match... just too small.  This chili freezes well and keeps forever.  The only additions I made were fish sauce - if you know why fish sauce works then add it.  If not, you won't miss it.

Everybody said this was the best chili they ever tasted, including a guest who almost wouldn't even try it because she doesn't like chili with beans.  I made it exactly per the recipe, except that I left out the sausage because I didn't have any.

I want to start by saying I made this recipe EXACTLY as written. It was amazing! Best chili I have ever made. We had a group of my husbands friends over and they all went back for seconds and thirds.

Really tasty Chili.  Watch the salt though!  Bouillon cubes are plenty salty for this recipe.  Let your taste buds decide.  The only thing I changed was less cayenne pepper and I added 1/2 cup of red wine and 2 cups of water-slow cooked on high for 2 hours, then 1 hour on low.  Yummsville!!!

Chili is fantastic! I used dry pinto beans and dry black beans that I precooked, no canned beans. It is spicy, but just the way I love it!

The husband said, "That's some good chili!" and I would agree. It has a nice flavor and it's not too spicy.  I let it simmer for four hours and we ate it the next day. I also doubled the recipe which made a GIANT pot of chili.

As a cook all my life I have made so many different chili's. This one if made correctly and not rushed is one of the best you can make.  I have yet to serve it to anyone who was not very very happy with it. You can adjust the spices to your liking to make it you own version. But you cannot go wrong with this chili.  So enjoy, and remember eating is something we all do and is one of the most enjoyable  experiences in life

Absolutely loved the taste, but it was just much TOO HOT for everyone's taste.  I made it again with 1/2 the chili powder and it was perfect.

This was a huge hit! I did not add celery as we don't really care for it in my household. I did include the chile seeds since we love spicy food. I've made it twice so far and it came out amazing.

Followed the recipe to a T except to omit cayenne pepper.  We've got two small children that don't eat spicy food.  This chili is the best that I have ever made or tasted anywhere.  This will definitely get made this winter and into the future.

I made this several years ago for my sons high school Jazz night  event for the chili cookoff. I made is EXACTLY as specified and won 1st place, out of about 30 entries. To top it off, I'd never made homemade chili before in my life. This is perfection!

My husband asked me to make chili for a winter camping trip with his Brother-In-Law and Cousin. I said sure because I love to cook, then panicked because I don't eat beef or pork. I do turkey chili but if I made that for these three meatatarians it would not go well. Found this recipie and thought it was perfect! Who can resist spicy chili with bacon and beer! It was a huge hit! The guys at it all weekend and wanted more. Only changes I made were to make it spicier by request. Added hot jalapeños, used all spicy beans and tomatoes with habanero peppers. This is my go to chili! So good I'm making it again tonight so my hubby can take it to work tomorrow for lunch for his work crew. He's a pretty picky eater so if he asked me to make it again to show it off to the guys you know it's good. Thanks!

Omitted the peppers and didn't have beef bullion so I used a can of chicken stock.  Wasn't too spicy and used turkey chopped meat for a healthier version.

I have made this chili about a dozen times and made these small changes. All turkey meat (don't overcook during browning), twice the garlic, half the cumin, a half bottle of Beck's Dark beer, instead of 3 cans of pinto beans I mix it up with 1 pinto, 1 dark red kidney, and 1 can butter beans.  Maybe throw in a small can of green chilies as well.
Great recipe.

This is sooooo good. What a great mix of flavors! I reduced the spiciness, knowing you can always sprinkle a little on after. I will definitely make it again.

Will certainly be making again! getting all the ingredients the first time was a bit overwhelming, but once you have everything it is so easy to make! I followed this recipe exactly as it was listed. It tasted great, but I did add 2 tbsp of valentina hot sauce and about 3 tbsp of Badia complete seasoning. My husband had 4 PLATES! oh, and I only added 1 jalapeño pepper.

Followed recipe as far as ingredients.  I cooked the meat and (due to travel plans) mixed it with the other ingredients in a crockpot, stored in fridge overnight and  took with me to a get-together where I slow-cooked in crockpot for several hours.  It turned out well and received many compliments.  I admit I hate cooking (and am not very good at it) but the preparation (chopping etc) wasn't really that bad.   Next time, I would follow another tip I saw here to cook the meat with the onions.

Made it without the sausage, spicy chili beans, and bacon because I did not have them on hand, but it was still great chili!  Looking forward to trying it again as written.

Best chili I have ever made! Made this for a chili cook-off at work and won first place with this! The only changes I made to this was removing the beer and replacing it with water, and removing the bacon bits. Turned out perfect that way!

Turn out great, better then expected. I did put a full Sierra Nevada in and added a little extra spice to it and an extra lb of beef to make it nice and meaty. Cooked the beef with minced garlic and onion to add flavor.

So I made a few changes.. no beer, no tomato paste, and no chili beans. Instead I used black beans (1 can), kidney beans (1 can) and 2 cans tomato sauce. I also added cilantro, and a can of rotel (instead of plain diced tomatoes).

This chili is awesome.  I added a couple poblano peppers to go with the jalapeño and the spice level is just right.  Have also substituted Jimmy Dean spicy/hot sausage when ground Italian sausage was scarce, and it worked well.

Used this recipe and added corn and upped the spices by 1/2  and used a couple of Serrano peppers.  It won the chili cook off at work, which was voted on by the students that we teach.

This is a good basic chili but too hot for us. I would put more meat in it if I made it again.

I have made this several times and it is now my go to recipe. My wife does not like it hot, so I cut back on some of the heat, but it still has a great flavor. Definitely worth the time it takes.

Fantastic recipe to use as a launch point. 
I've used this as my base often and received heaps of love in return.
The only alteration that I feel qualified being... 
use a decent beer in the mix.
My favorite being Boddington Scotch Ale. The malt allows a sweetness that buffers the heat (I always crank up the peppers, most folks on this site tend to shy away)
By far my favorite variation. An Octoberfest works as well if you can get it in season.
Good eats my friends!

Made without beer and didn't have spicy chili beans,  but everything else exact. hands down the best chili recipe out there. 8 hours on low in crockpot, didn't have to add more seasoning, it was perfect. I love spicy food and can tolerate some best, and this was maybe a mild to medium heat. 10 yr old daughter said it was perfect. totally worth the long list of ingredients!

This is by far the best chili I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out amazing!! My teenage boys beg me to make this for them and can be somewhat picky when it comes to ingredients like onions and peppers. I tried to half this recipe once since it makes so much but it did not come out as well. I guess the next time I make it, I will just have to freeze the leftovers!

Have made this recipe 5-6 times now.  The number of reviews and rating says it all.  Pretty much the best chili I have ever had outside of a couple niche restaurants that had one-off chili's.  As presented this recipe makes a TON of chili...best part is it is just as good or even better as left overs as the tastes blend.  Will be using it at a work chili cook-off; will see how it goes.

This recipe is very good!  I left out the chili peppers because I have a small child, but I still used the hot sauce for a little heat.  What's chili without some heat, right.  Next time, I don't use as much celery though.  I felt it was a little too much celery for my liking.  Overall, it's a very good recipe.  Thanks

I've made this chili many times for parties, gatherings, and for friends, and it is always a huge hit.  The best chili I've ever tasted!  I make it just as it says in the recipe and serve it with fritos, grated cheddar, and sour cream for garnish.

I will use half of the salt and add a can of green chiles next time, but other than that, this is the best chili I have ever made :)

I've made this chili so many times and consistently get rave reviews every time I serve it.  I made it without the bacon bits and beer, and it's still super yummy!

This is the base of my chili I do regularly, it's awesome. I do use real bacon and sauté the veggies in the bacon fat, of course. Other than that, I don't mess with too much. Today I'll be adding in smoked meat to it and see how that turns out. Smoking some beef short ribs for the Chili might add an extra layer of awesomeness.

This was pretty good. I didn't add the beans since I don't like them but it turn out really good but I also think maybe I should have just added 3 beef cubes or less cause it was a little salty.

Save for a few personal modifications, this is a go-to recipe for an absolutely deadly* chili.

This is my go to Chili recipe now. Every time I make it, people rave. Since we have a 4 year old, I eliminate all the spice and leave bowls of jalapenos, diced chiles, and Tabasco on the counter, so people can spice it up as they please. This is Great Chili.

I thought this chili was fantastic!!  I brought to a party where 3 others made chili and all agreed this was the best one.  I loved the flavors.  The only changes I made was to half the recipe.  I used one pound of stew meat and one pound of Italian sausage.  I also cooked 4 strips of bacon and crumbled into the chili.  I also ended up putting almost the whole bottle of beer in there.  Cooked in my slow cooker on high for one hour and then low for 5 more hours.  This is going to be my go to chili recipe for now on. UPDATE:  I MADE THIS WITH A POUND OF DEER HOT BREAKFAST DEER SAUSAGE AND DEER CHILI MEAT AND IT WAS THE BOMB!!! BEST I HAVE EVER HAD OR MADE!

This is by far the BEST chili ever!  I will not make any other chili unless it is something totally different, like pumpkin vegan chili.  I don't eat pork, so we use ground turkey or beef and tyrkey or chicken italian sausage.  I'm also gluten and dairy free (allergies) so I omit the dairy extras, use a gluten free beer, like Omission or New Planet, and use an allergy friendly beef broth(just enough to cover a half to 3/4 of the ingredients) instead of the beef bouillon.  My husband and my children love it!

I didn't change anything, but added a little bit of tomato juice, and a little more beer than what it calls for to make it a little more liquidy.  
I didn't have a green chile pepper, so I skipped that, but the chili was spicy enough without it.
I am going to make it again this weekend!

This was amazing chili and I won a chili cookoff with the recipe. However, it took me 2 hours of prep time for all the browning meat, chopping, and mixing and not 30 minutes as listed in the recipe.  The first time I made it I doubled the 30 minute estimate prep time and that was nowhere near enough.  Next time I will make sure I leave 2 hours of prep time and an hour and a half cooking time.  But it was worth it all.  Mmmm mmmmm.   One note:  some of my friends thought this was too spicy, but most of us thought it was just right.

1.5 lbs duck breast instead of the sausage.          1 can each black, chili and kidney beans.             1 jalapeño                                                         Fresh basil instead of dried, finely chopped       1 can of Surly Furious beer (Minnesota).                  The trick to any game meat is marinating it for 24 hours in milk first (I also add salt, garlic, and a touch of curry to duck specifically).  After that I just treat it like its steak.  I fry the duck with garlic and onions till the breasts are slightly pink in the center then add to the chili mixture in a crock pot and cook on low for 6-8 hours.  So tasty!

This is the best chili recipe hands down!!! I modify it slightly for my 6 year old who thought the original recipe was a bit too spicy.   I used 1 jalapeno and no cayenne.  I love the spice and even with those modifications it still has a kick so I top his portion with a heap of sour cream to cut the heat!   DELICIOUS!!!!!

Can't deny 5 stars on this one!  Made this instead of my usual for our family "chili night" and everyone thought it was great.  I was short on celery so I added a little celery seed to compensate, and I like a hint of cinnamon in chili so I added 1/4 tsp. I let it simmer for 4 hours. It fed 10 adults with no leftovers (after 2nd helpings), served over rice.

Delicious! Definitely a meal I will be making again soon! One thing though, if you like spicy this isn't very hot. Maybe double the hot sauce or add more chili powder. Overall a great dish!

This is our go to recipe for chili. Just made another batch and here are our modifications. 1/2 lb applewood bacon fried and drained, and chopped very fine. . 1.5 lbs porterhouse steak. Used 1 poblano and one Serrano for the green chili peppers.  Used amber bock.   one can chili beans spicy and 4 cans of various kidney and pinto  beans. Extra tomatoes.  Delicious with the steak.

Really good! Very hearty. My spouse can't eat legumes, so I subbed a can of mexi corn and a can of potatoes for the beans. I also added a jalapeño for extra kick. Even my picky kids love it.

I am not a great cook but this recipe is fool proof! Everyone I fed it to loved it! And I have made it multiple times now  with always a good response. Things I changed: I used (1) 16oz diced tomatoes with chilis  with the liquid and (2) 16 oz can of diced tomatoes with low salt.  And I do drain the liquid for those.  1 can regular chili beans & (2) can chili beans  with medium chili sauce.  I also never have the time to cut up all those veggies so I don't add any of them.  I add dried onion in place of the real onion and  I have chopped garlic in the frig always so I added that.  I add a pound of cooked bacon because my kids love bacon.   It's more of a meat chili but VERY GOOD!

Great recipe!   Have made it for home and potlucks.  Many requests for the recipe.  You can also play with the sausage, cayenne pepper and green peppers to get the heat favorable for the crowd.  In the PNW most people prefer a medium heat, so I cut the cayenne in half and use Anaheim peppers.   Just made a batch with that and used Louisiana hot link sausage instead of Italian.  Raving reviews from the consumers.

This is the BEST chili I've ever had and love to make it too!  I stick pretty much to the recipe - I omit the green chile peppers and bacon bits...and usually add a whole can of beer (gotta taste to make sure it's fresh right?!!)  Never had it with the corn chips - but the usual sour cream and cheese is a must :)

I've used this recipe multiple times now and it is delicious!! I make a few minor changes that include using applewood smoked bacon (4 slices chopped), sweet Italian sausage, more garlic, fresh herbs, half of a porter beer, and I add a few more hot peppers and more brown sugar for a sweet heat. I also don't use the bullion - there are enough flavors going on that it is unnecessary.   I've made this for company and it is always a winner

Delicious! Love the heartiness and kick to this chili. It's a staple in our house! We've omitted the tomato paste and celery for the most part (since we never use those items for anything else) and it's still great!

I use turkey instead of hamburger and no sausage, but otherwise follow the recipe. Great tasting chili with good spice - just enough to ice the back of your head a little cold sweat but doesn't make your mouth hot.

By far one of the best Chili's I've ever made can't wait to see if I win on my chili cook off. The only thing I changed was I took sausage links brown them on all sides and then cut them instead of using chopped pork sausage

It was some work, but worth the mess! I used home grown peppers so it's super hot but so good.

I left out the bell peppers and celery so my daughter would eat it but this is a solid recipe.  I'd say it is the best batch I've ever made.  If you don't like spicy, you can back off the hot sauce or cayenne but I thought they complimented the flavor without being overpowering.

I have made this recipe many times and everyone that tries it has loved it. I usually make it with ground turkey instead of beef and it's still always a hit.

This chili is great.  I even won the chili competition at work with this recipe.  We will make different variations each time, but still follow this recipe every time.  Sometimes I even add some Daves Ultimate Insanity hot sauce for an extra kick! :)

Really simple. Just takes time. Didn't have any chili powder, so added more cayenne and hot sauce. Only used 1 lb. of ground beef instead of two, one 15-oz. can of red kidney and on 15-oz can of pinto beans instead of 3 cans of chili beans.Turned out fantastic! A little on the spicy side, but that's typically not an issue.

Best  chili I ever had! I was surprised using the canned beans vs dry but it was a gastrointestinal delight. I admit though that I did tweak some of the spices as I like my food a little spicier but I'm an old guy who's been tweaking every recipe since I learned how to cook. This is good and it freezes well. Thanks so much.

This is the best chili recipe I've ever made.   I only make a couple of small adjustments:  I saute the  chopped veggies along with the minced garlic in bacon fat before I add them to the pot; I use 2 cans of original Rotel in place of one of the cans of diced tomatoes; I don't add the chile peppers; and I use about a TBSP of ancho chile powder in the 1/4 cup of chili powder.  I also find that a good dark or boch beer gives it a good rich flavor.

At Laconia Bike Week (camping) we have what we like to call garbage or Laconia stew. Very similar ingredients but with hot dogs. I substituted the sausage with the hd's  & it was still great! Oh I did add a lot of real bacon

I've made this for about 2yrs now and have gotten rave reviews from it. I must say that this recipe is pretty extensive in the ingredients but is honestly the best base chili recipe on this site if you follow the ingredients exactly. You can easily build off this recipe and personalize it a hundred different ways. I myself use fresh ingredients and dice up my tomatoes, omit the oregano, add a dash of lime and cilantro, use 3 habanero peppers, add a tsp of mustard, and use italian hot sausage, turkey and ground chuck.  It tastes amazing! 

In summary: Great starting point to really making your own personalized chili. Be adenturous :)

I made a double batch but substituted  ground venison for the beef and bulk sweet Italian venison sausage.  It made enough for us to share at a family picnic and we still had enough for our family of four to eat for three more meals. The whole family was raving about it and can't wait till I make it again. I used a little more green and red peppers and less onion and no corn chips or beer for my personal taste however.

This (slightly modified) recipe won me 2nd place in my office's Chili Cookoff.  I despise beans in my chili so I only used 1 can + liquid just for the thickening agents; also dislike celery so I omitted that as well.  Other than that I made it as instructed, it's so good you can even forego the Frito's and eat it as is or with a dollop of sour cream.  The great thing about this chili is you can tweak it so many ways to suit your tastes and it's all good!  This is my go-to chili recipe now for winter and Super Bowl parties.

Best Chili recipe, hands down! Complex flavor a and just enough kick. I've made this several times and I always get rave reviews! I've made exactly as written and also changed up the beans, using black beans, dark kidney beans, and white chili beans. Absolutely delicious every time!

Lots of steps but definitely worth it. I brought it to a tailgate and it was a hit. The children didn't care for the spice, that means more for the adults!  This will be my go to recipes.  It makes a large batch so I was able to freeze 2 batches for later

The first time I made this recipe, we devoured it.  My mother in law was begging to take some home.  This time I doubled the recipe and didn't tell her I made it!  The only change was omitted the chili peppers to make it more family friendly.

so good! I used to make a chili that had a lot of beans but this has more balance with the meats. I had a few alterations... I make a half recipe first of all. plenty for a family of 4. make sure you drain your beans, and leave juice in the one can as directed. if you use all the juice it will be too much sauce. like others, I grilled bacon and saute my veges (I used red, green and yellow pepper) in the drippings. I used extra garlic. didn't have a green chili pepper so I used hot italian sausage and extra Frank's red hot sauce. it still had a kick but lacked a little in heat for me (I like it hot). my 8 year old who doesn't like chili loved it.  I omitted the beer and replaced white sugar with brown. still had amazing flavor. I serve mine with cheese, sour cream and banana peppers. insanely good. try it with banana peppers! this has been my thing since I was a teen and everyone loves it. they really compliment this recipe.

Made this tonight and is great already with only 2 hours simmering. My modifications so it fit my family: used 2# venison sausage and 1# ground turkey. Omitted celery, red pepper, chile peppers, bacon bits (didn't have any) and hot pepper sauce. Used 2 green bell peppers and just sprinkled some cayenne in it (didn't use full amount). Also used 4 cans of mild chili beans undrained, 1 14 oz can fire roasted tomatoes, 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with basil and oregano and 1 28 oz can of plum tomatoes. It was just hot enough. Will be a favorite in my recipe box now!

This is my go to chili recipe. It's easy enough that a beginner can make it without much trouble. I make it at least once a year then freeze about half of it in smaller containers to unfreeze throughout the winter. I usually make it as is, but every once in a while add a few things or take a few things out (usually because I forgot to but it or didn't have it on hand).  It seems to be fairly fool proof. It has just enough spice that you feel the heat, but it didn't overwhelm the other flavors.

We will make this again soon! We added 4 serano peppers and a little extra beer I think (we were also drinking the beer so I cant be too sure). This tastes like professional chili and Im no prfessional cook! LOVE it!

Made this almost exactly per recipe.  Entire family loved it!!! Only changes I made were to 86 the tabasco (children) and I put the tomatoes in the food processor (one child doesn't like chunky tomatoes).  And I added the whole can of beer!  Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe, but be warned, it is spicy if you don't let it sit overnight. My son loves it exactly as it is as soon as it is finished. It has a very nice blend of spices. I recommend making the chili and letting it sit overnight in the fridge - the taste was amazing, and the heat mellowed. Most things are better the next day, and this was no exception. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Very, very good!!  I did change a couple things more for personal reasons.  I prefer my chili more meaty than bean-y so I only used two cans of beans.  I also only used two beef cubes and a little less cumin.  Then let it cook down so it was thick.  Dee-lish!

This is the best chili recipe I've ever had. Sometimes I change the peppers up a bit so that my kids will eat it. Other times I male it just as written and that's how my husband loves it. I've made this at least 100 times and everytime it's a hit with whoever we share it with. My favorite game day meal!!!

Outstanding.  I have made this for a few functions to great reviews between young and old.  To appeal to my family, I have to take out the heat.  To get the best results I use freshest ingredients I can.  Go to the butcher counter and get a few slices of good wood smoked thick cut bacon, along with hamburger and ground sausage.  If you have fresh basil, garlic and oregano you can back off on the quantities slightly.  I prefer to cut up Roma tomatoes rather than canned.  I use 2 cans of black beans, one can kidney beans, and 1 can chili beans.  For the beer, a dark beer, like a stout works best, compared to a lager or pilsner.  Since my family thinks black pepper is "too spicy" I made this one week ago for a football game party.  5 qts. and no left overs.  Turned out fabulous.  Not too spicy, but enough to tingle the back of your throat.  Adding cheese really mellows out the heat.  Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made very minor tweaks based on things I did or did not have but nothing that changed the integrity of the recipe.  Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you and you likely have half of it in your house already.  Great recipe!!!!!

GREAT WAY TO GET A PICKY EATER  (me) TO EAT VEGGIES!
Of all the chili recipes I've tried (so many), this is my favorite by a long shot. There are a lot of ingredients in this that I would normally pick out of any other dish, but I love them all in this. Following the recipe alone gives it a nice kick and is spicy enough for me. My dad and brother like to add Frank's Red Hot sauce to their bowls. For some reason, it is sometimes difficult for me to find chile peppers in my area. I've substituted the two chiles for most of a single poblano pepper before and it is also very nice.

This is the best chili recipe ever!!  Entered it in a chili cook off fundraiser at church and would have won if not for it being legal to buy votes.  There was not a drop left half way through the evening.  I did cut down a little on the heat so that more would enjoy it.

This is awesome chili.  It has a little heat, but not so much that a group of mixed company can't handle it.  (Those who like it hotter can also add a bit of this or that to it.)   Purdue may not be winning on the field, but they're winning at the tailgate.  Well done!  (On a side note, I made just a few changes...whole bottle of beer, ditched the green peppers, added ground chipotle chili peppers, added a dash of cinnamon.)

I accidentally brought this into work for a potluck and am stuck making it everytime! I change it up a bit switching meats for a variety of beef, chicken, turkey, bison and venison to change things up. I recommend adding half of the seasonings the first day, fridge overnight, reheat and taste and add accordingly to your group. I never add the beer and it still turns out good. BTW the better the ingredients the better the chili. Store brand products don't do this justice! I estimate about $50 a batch for the best ingredients. Thanks for sharing and forcing me to make it every few months.

I love trying new chili recipes and this did not disappoint. I substituted turkey in place of the beef and no one could tell the difference. There is just so much flavor here. I used a porter, a full bottle less a few drinks:) and added extra chili powder and hot sauce to taste.

I absolutely love chili of all kinds and I'd have to say this one is at the top.  I prepared this for my family and particularly for my four year old son who asked me to make chili.  After reading the recipe I thought it would be too spicy for the kidos.  I cut the hot sauce out and replaced the can of spicy beans with regular beans and it wasn't too spicy at all.  I also used elk hamburger rather than beef hamburger.  After the changes the chili was still amazing!!!!! I will make this over and over again!!!!!

Well, I'm one of several thousand reviewers who loved this chili. If you've found this review, than you already know all the variations people made to enhance/improve it. I replaced the ground beef with steak, cubed it and removed the fat, used flavored canned tomatoes instead of plain, used 2 Tbsp brown sugar instead of the white, and sauteed the veges and garlic in the bacon fat (I cooked 4 strips). Be sure you know the flavor of the beer you add as it will be noticed. I was afraid of too much heat so I reduced the chili powder to 1/8 cup and it was only slightly "hot." I entered our local chili cook-off contest and it won first place in the meat and bean category however, all the other entries were much spicier. For our taste buds, I'm glad I cut down on the heat. It is time consuming but worth it!

I used extra lean ground beef and turkey sausages since we don't eat pork. Plus I omitted some of the heat from this dish in order to accommodate the kids. Came out perfectly.

I used jalapeno peppers in the recipe as we like Spivey. Rice will tone it down...or just warm your guests.
The recipe entails a lot of dicing and prep but definitely worth it. Once I added a piece of London broil which I pretty much just seared and then cut in small pieces.  
When I cooked this in the crock pot it was not as good just because of texture. Thee veggies cooked down more so rthey were mushU. I prefer watching the pot and simmering a few hours. It is best served next day...if u can keep it that long
I always get asked when I'm making this Chile again.

Awesome recipe,  I did modified mine a bit. I cooked fresh bacon from butcher and put those morsels in. Also, beans I used were Boston Baked beans for chilli. Three kidney beans in mild sauce and 1 black beans can in mild chilli sauce.  A few other things with ingredient amounts but nothing too crazy.

Awesome recipe, but I did change a couple things: I only used 3 cans of beans and I used canned chipotle peppers rather than the green chili peppers and I used my slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  My family loved, loved, loved it.  Thank you mightypurdue22!!

amazing and full of flavor, I don't like making chilli a lot because it typically tastes the same but this has an amazing taste and combination. all I did differently was left out the following ingredients: Italian sausage, 1 chili pepper, and beer

Best chili I've ever made. I just used regular beans instead of chili beans and I cut up beef chuck roast into chunks to make a heartier chili. Amazing and absolutely delicious. The whole crowd loved it.

This chili was awesome! My minions loved it. I slow-cooked for 6 hours to increase the taste. Nice spice to it but not overbearing.

My favorite chili recipe ever! The only change I have ever purposely made was to omit the hot sauce so the chili wouldn't be too spicy for kids. It's still got plenty of kick. Otherwise, I left out the celery a couple of times just because I had none and the chili was still perfect. I always have people asking for this recipe.

I just looked this up again to make for the second time.  I should have written my review after the first time.  This is really an awesome chili! The perfect go-to recipe.  I was a little iffy about the beer, but it really worked. I added cubed chili/stew meat because I'm from Texasssssss!  It was fantastic! I used Yeungling Black and Tan beer.  Can't wait to have it again!

Excellent recipe.  We aren't fans of Italian sausage, so I nixed that.  I used real bacon instead of the bacon bits and browned it with the beef and onions.  I halved the recipe but used the full 2lbs of beef since I didn't use the sausage.  I kept the full 1/4 cup of chili powder and usually go with 2tsp of cumin because I love it.  I've won two chili cookoffs with this recipe as my base.

Just made this almost verbatim, except..used a slow cooker for 4 hours, omitted the green and red peppers and halved the onion.  (Just our taste and tummy preferences).  Oh my Goodness!!!! SOOOOOOO delicious.  Super consistency and lots of heat.  This will be my default from now on.  Do yourself a favor this winter....make it!

I made this chili with everything except the sausage and bacon bits (had friends who don't eat pork) cooked the ground beef on stove, then threw everything in crock pot and cooked all day. Cooled, removed fat. Put green peppers in and heated back up. Got Rave revies

Everyone in our family loved this chili, and we're all TEXANS (fifth and sixth generation, at that)! I have some trouble making a recipe just as it's written, so I left some things out (bacon bits, red bell pepper, Tabasco) and substituted some things (canned green chiles for the fresh ones). I also left out the bouillion cubes. I didn't want all the added sodium. I played with the spices a bit to make sure it had enough flavor. The Italian sausage helped in that area and was a great addition to the ground beef. I think this will be my go-to recipe that I'll use as a guide with my own modifications. 
Even Longhorns and Aggies can get along with Boilermakers, especially when food is involved.

Absolutely wonderful!! my family and I have been making this for two years now, on Halloween, we get it going in the crock pot in the mid morning, and when we get back from trick or treating we have this and lime sherbet punch, they go so amazing together! we have nick named this Halloween chili, and it wont be the same on Halloween if we skipped this!! soooooooo wonderful, wouldn't change anything. even the young kids like it_(2 years and younger) some people might like it topped over corn chips, and with cheese and sour cream on top. right now its less than 2 weeks from Christmas, and we all have a craving for it again, so in the pot it goes!! have a BIG crock pot it gets full to the top!!!! :)

This is a crowd pleaser! I am not a big fan of Italian sausage so before I brown the meat I mix the beef and sausage well. That way you get the beef flavor with a hint of sausage. It's perfect!!!

Thanks for the recipe. This is the only one I use now when I make chili.  I added some things of my own and changed it just a little bit. I used hunts garlic  fire roasted diced tomatoes mixed with spicy red pepper diced tomatoes  adds more wonderful flavor. I used 3 jalapeño peppers and 3 cans of black beens  instead  turned out delicious. Try the chili with  Tostitos fajita scoops

We loved this recipe. We only used 1 lb of the beef instead of 2 and I was glad as it was just the right thickness when cooked. It's a bit spicy but some sour cream and shredded cheese on top and it mellows it out...perfection!

this is definitely a keeper in the recipe box. I of course change things up. i cooked fresh bacon and used the grease to saute' the veggies. browned the stew beef and burger and then tossed it all together. The heat is to taste and i also added some liquid smoke and roasted red peppers. This is going to hunting camp and my son gave it a 2 thumbs up

I have been using this recipe for years and finally decided to give it a review. This is an excellent recipe that can be modified to taste. The only substitutes I make are honey for sugar and turkey bacon for  bacon bits. I leave out the beer also. I like that it incorporates both meat and some veggies so it feels heartier. Every time I make this, there are rarely any leftovers. I have been making it at least once every winter for the past few years and have made it for the in-laws as well who just loved it.  The corn chips go perfectly with the dish.

I have always made a pretty good chili that everyone always enjoys but was ready for a change. This chili was awesome! Entered it in the chili cook off at work and won. There were only about 10 other entries but nevertheless this is a good combo of ingredients IMO. I used large diced tomatoes and chopped the peppers and celery a little large for a chunkier texture. Probably will go smaller size on veggies next time and try a pound of steak or stew meat in lieu of a pound of burger.

I just made this recipe for my family.  My husband and I both love recipes on the spicy side, and this was the best Chili I have ever made.  I did use 1/2 lbs of spicy Italian Sausage, and 1/2 lbs of mild Italian Sausage to add a little more spice.  Also, I used 3 kinds of beans - hot chili beans, light red & dark red kidney beans (drained).  We can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!

Came out a little spicy but the flavors are fantastic!  Subbed one can of chili beans for black beans, and used a half pound of pork sausage with 1.5 of ground beef.  Highly recommended

Made this chili on November 15, 2014 and came in 2nd at my church's chili cook-off in London, Ontario, Canada. The chili itself is very tasty! The beer, oregano and basil give it a really unique flavour. The only mistake I made, was that the Knorr beef bouillon cubes I bought were larger than normal and made the chili a bit salty.

Made this for our annual company chili cookoff and won first place!  I added an extra can of chili beans (kidneys) and a can of tomato sauce.  I also chose to use 2 poblanos (no seeds) for the chili peppers.  I added the extra ingrediants to take the heat down a bit and it really worked well.

Pretty much made this recipe "as is" with the exception of going 50/50 on spicy beans versus chili beans. My wife and I enjoy spicy. Hands down this is one of the best chilis we have ever ate. It was absolutely delicious.

The best chili ever. There are a lot of ingredients, and it is a bit of work, but totally worth it. I made it for a party, and everyone wanted the recipe. Definitely making it again.

I loved this.  I made a few changes based on what I had in the pantry (i.e. no bacon or celery and used canned diced chilies instead of fresh chili peppers) but it was fantastic.  I wasn't sure of the taste alone, but when I served it over noodles with cheddar cheese and sour cream it was amazing.  My parents raved that it was the best chili they ever had, better than my step-dad who makes some good chili.  Almost as good as Real Chili in Milwaukee, WI.  Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you.  The hardest part is browning the meat and chopping the peppers/onion.  All the rest of the ingredients you dump in.

This is my go-to chili recipe. My entire family loves it! I discovered it years ago while searching for a good chili recipe. I love the fact that I can easily change up the ingredients to make it more or less spicy. It always comes out great, no matter what. It's a lot of ingredients, I know, but SO worth the time. We like it even better the next day. :) Thank you for the recipe mightyPurdue!!

My favorite chili recipe. First time I followed the recipe to the letter. Amazing!!! Huge hit with 20 guest second time around. Made it again today. I forgot to pick up beef bouillon cubes so subbed with 1T Kitchen Bouquet & omitted Italian sausage adding 1lb. of turkey for hubby. Very pleased.

I don't cook very often. I had to buy all the ingredients, spent a lot of money, and now have chili for months! The good news: it is delicious, has a good spice, and I live in Minneapolis so this should last me through the long, soul-crushing winter. The bad news: I don't have enough tupperware to hold all the leftovers. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent chili recipe. This is the perfect amount of spice for my husband and me. We do like our chili a little thicker, so I added 2T of cornstarch mixed with 2T cold water about an hour after starting to simmer. I think next time I might reduce the amount of beef bouillon. But I'll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe as a really good base.  I will of course tweak it for my taste and my mood at the time.  Sometime I will substitute corn for the cayenne pepper, green chile peppers and reduce the hot sauce for those in my family that can't take the heat. Other times I double the cayenne pepper and use serrano peppers and jalapenos for the green chiles add a little more beer and GAME ON!  The point is, if you don't like this recipe exactly then tweak it, to make it your own, if you don't like canned ingredients then use fresh, this recipe is still the makings of great chili.

My first Chili and a HOME RUN!!!! (I love baseball)
Wife was saying "This is too complicated", She is amazed how simple it actually was, and can't stop eating it. 

We have a Chili cook off at work in a few weeks, this should take #1.

Love the video and learned a few tricks from it, also was able to upload the ingredients to MY FITNESS PAL and keep in my daily goal.

I have made this chili several times. Each time I make it a little different, just depending on what meat and ingredients I have on hand. However, one thing remains the same - I cook it in the crock pot for SEVERAL hours, usually all day. The longer this stuff cooks, the better. Also, use a good beer :)

I loved this recipe.  Very easy and delicious. I had to leave out the Italian ground sausage because I did not have it on hand nor the oregano, however I had Italian seasoning which had the oregano in it.  I cut the recipe in half because I live alone, but used the same amount of beer.  Wow!  I also decided to add a can of Margaret Holmes Triple Succotash. It is still simmering, but I took some Italian bread and dipped it in the chile and oh my!

I lost my original Award winning recipe somewhere and was freaking out! I came upon this one in my search for something similar. I actually used 2 different recipes (what I liked from each) to get my own. Anyway, This has currently been simmering for a little over 2 hours now, and it is AMAZING! Better than my first. However, I did make some changes. First, I used only Ground Chuck. I omitted celery, but cooked 1/2 lb of Bacon and sautéed the onions and a jar of Roasted Red peppers with Minced Garlic, followed most of the rest, with the exception of using Guiness beer (the whole bottle) 1 can of light kidney (Drained) 1 can of Dark kidney (undrained) 1 can of Chili beans (undrained) I added 2 tsps of Cocoa (Unsweetened) Brown Sugar & White, I also added one half cup of Brewed dark coffee. I added about a quarter cup of Tomato sauce also. It is so good right now- I cant wait until tomorrow. I will let it simmer another hour, refridgerate & Reheat tomorrow. Will give you the Audience reviews tomorrow!

Tested on family one night following recipe and they said it had great flavor, but needed heat and no sweet.  Made it night before Chili Cook Off at work. Did not add the sugar. Used hot italian sausage and did not drain the grease(the ground beef and sausage I used didn't leave a great amount of grease, plus we didn't want to lose any of the hot italian seasonings) I used 2 cans of the spicy beans and 3 cans not spicy. I won the Chili Cook Off. Great flavor and just enough heat!  Great recipe for great tasting chili!

This is the best chilli i've ever made.  However, I tweaked it a bit.  Only used 1 Tbl chilli powder, used 1 jalepino pepper instead of 2 green chilli peppers, used no hot sauce, and used 1 full can of beer.  It turned out great!

I had to try a new chili recipe because my old was too boring.  This chili was amazing! My husband loved it, and even raved on the next day.  I used other review suggestions, I cut everything in half due to the amount the recipe makes. I cooked it in the crock pot for 9 hours, it made the chili more flavorful. I also used mild chili beans because my kids do not like very spicy things.  I will be making this recipe again and again.  I am so happy I found this before the weather changes.

I made this for our church's chili cookoff tonight. It won first place and the Golden Spoon! I just replaced the beer with Kitchen Basics chicken stock and I cooked all of the vegetables in the bacon grease before adding to the pot. I used real bacon that I crumbled up. I probably didn't give it enough time simmer and absorb all of the flavors and it still beat out all of the other chili's that the fantastic women of my church brought tonight! I'm saving this recipe and will use again and again!

This is a good mild to medium hot chili. The flavors blended nicely. I subbed real bacon for the "bits" and used 1 pound ground turkey in place of the 2nd pound of beef chuck to lighten it up. I also used 2 cans of chili beans in sauce with 1 can each of rinsed cannelli and kidney beans for variety and visual appeal. Using this for my neighborhood chili cook off since my standard turkey chili recipe took 2nd a couple years ago. We'll see if I win!!!

I've made a LOT of chili, and I think this is the best ever.  Plenty of heat, but not TOO much.  I hade to make slight variations using what I had in the fridge.  I used 1/2 a red pepper and 1/2 a yellow pepper, since I had no green or chili.  I used one can of Rotel tomatoes, and one can of chili spiced tomatoes.  I think the tomatoes and beans can be changed according to your pantry, but I think it's the spice combination that really makes this special.  I can't wait until the next chili cook-off comes around so I can test it!!

THE BEST CHILI WE HAVE EVER HAD! Made exactly as listed in this recipe and was worth the extra time it took since we did not using a chili "starter" packet like we normally do. It was even better day 2. The heat/spice was just right for everyone including kids and those who wanted it hotter added some Red Hot. This recipe is a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe. I scaled back on the peppers and did not add beer (I forgot to buy some) and it was delicious. The hubby said it had a nice kick to it and I agree. Great recipe!

This chili is fantastic.  I would surely love to try the recipe of people that say they don't like it, because if it's better than this it must be godly.  Remember, heat and spice are very dependant on who is at the end of the spoon, this is why you "taste and adjust seasoning" after two hours.
Edit: 2019 and still lovin’ this just noticed it says “chili beans” what are “chili beans” other than red kidney beans?

I like to try lots of recipes and of all the chili’s I have made, this resides as my husband and my favorite! The only change I’ve made is using 2lbs sausage and 1lb burger and since we’ve got little kids I omit the cayenne all together. Loads of flavor and even without the cayenne it still has a good kick. We are fans! I’ve made this loads of times!

I just made this chili for the first time and my friends loved it.  I used ground turkey and poultry sausage to make it healthier, and they tasted great.  I was afraid it would be too spicy so I cut the cayenne pepper and black pepper in half and altogether eliminated the hot sauce and chili peppers.  Thankfully hot sauce and black pepper are things that can be added to individual taste.  It still had plenty of heat and was very enjoyable.  I can tell this is going to be one of my go to chilis.

This is one of the first recipes I tried from Allrecipes and it's one of my faves. I've been making this chili for years now and it always gets raves.

I make this just as stated with only a few changes... changes that fit my tastes... YMMV.

1. I use a good bratwurst instead of Italian sausage and it compliments the flavor much more! I've made it several times with Italian, but it's never as good as when I use good brats (the family completely agrees).

2. I did use a can of chili beans once, because we had it, and it added a nice spiciness. But I prefer to use 5 cans of beans: 3 dark red kidney and 2 black beans because I think it just tastes better and I like beans! (but I won't hesitate to use Chili Beans to replace one can of Dark Red kidney if the opportunity allowed)

3. I tried it with 'regular' beer and dark beer and, IMO, it tastes much better with dark beer.

4. I always add a Tbs of red pepper flakes and use "Better than Bullion" Roasted Beef flavor.

I thought it was a really great chili! I have made this chili several times already and my family loves it! I did cut the spice in half after making it the first time. Perfect if you like very spicy but since i have little ones that enjoy chili also i took it down a notch and it was just as good!

I usually don't consider recipes with so many ingredients, but I'm sure happy we decided to make this recipe.  It was so yummy!  Soft start with a nice kick.  The only thing we did different was cook the peppers with the meat.

Lots of ingredients yes, but hands down the best chili I've made and eaten.  I gave it to a friend who needed a recipe for a chili contest and she won second place.  Makes a big batch, so perfect for freezing.

This is the best chili recipe I have made. Seriously deep, rich, delicious flavor. I did not have sausage and I made my own beans, instead of canned, but it turned out great and it's my new chilir recipe. Thanks so much!

I have been making chili for over 10 years now so I am not sure what convinced me to try this recipe; maybe the fact that it had 3,000 reviews.  I was not happy with the flavor.  It had a tangy after flavor that was odd. Maybe it was the beer I used, but I did not like it.  Usually I try to do chili without fattening extras like cheese, but this one definitely needed something to cover the flavor.  I think I will stick to my old recipes.

I used one less can of beans and cooked real bacon and added a bit of the bacon grease but other than that this recipe is great. Yes it has a lot of components but the flavor blends well and it is worth the prep time. I put it in the croc pot for 8 hours and let everything blend to slow cooked perfection.

What a great recipe! It was fun to make and of course the longer it cooks it gets better. (especially the next day) I followed the directions to the t and wouldn't make any adjustments for great chili. It will be fun to try other meats such as deer or turkey. Thanks!!

I'm not a big chili fan, but my daughter made this a couple of weeks ago and I loved it!  Maybe all the vegetables give it that something extra that appeals to me???  I'm making it today for superbowl and can't wait to eat it again.

This recipe was fan-freaking-tastic! I made it exactly as instructed except for the bacon bits, and I only used half of an onion. It's not as spicy as it sounds but it was just the right amount perfect for parties or people who don't have the guts to take some heat. Ten Stars for This one!

Yes on December 19th on the day of the Playoff between 49ers and the
Seahawks.  I did change a little. Took out the beer and the hot pepper
and saute the onions, peppers and celery first. Cook in a slow cooker
and it was a big hit.
thank you for sharing

Talk about the best Chilli I've ever tasted. I pretty much followed the directions but instead of can beans (which  I'm not fond of) I soaked mine overnight and placed it in a crock pot. I also only had a pinch of chilli powder and used a jalapeño  pepper but with all of the other peppers, still tasted great. Fresh basil made a difference too instead of dried.

I made this chili on Christmas Eve for my family. It was a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of I only used one of the green chilis I purchased as I was a bit concerned it may end up being too spicy. It was perfect and I'm sure it would've been fine with the extra chili.

This was great chili. Made pretty much to the recipe. Omitted the tobasco and served it on the side. Used a chuck roast and chopped it instead of the he ground chuck. Would add more Anehiem peppers and maybe a couple jalapeños next time.

Update:  This is now my "go to" chili recipe and have made it several times.  I continue to use the hand chopped chuck.  It is a great recipe!

Fantastic!  I think DD added too much cumin, will try again - spicy enough for me - too much for kids - but easy and fun to make - takes entire crock pot!

Absolutely delicious.  I thought a recipe that has 5 stars must be amazing.  Prepared it as directed and it was perfect!!  Thank You for a wonderful recipe!!    We also ate it as a "Cincinnati Chili" over spaghetti with sliced black olives, sour cream, and shredded cheese.   Perfect!!

This chili is amazing!   I have had a lot of fun playing around with this recipe depending on what I have in the house.  Diced tomatoes are not necessary but the sausage makes a HUGE difference. I also tend to cut down on the beans (just personal preference). Many other recipes were just too simple with not enough flavor.

This is a great recipe, however, I made it as is, and it was way too spicy. After researching how to cut down the heat, I added three more table spoons of sugar, a couple squirts of ketchup, some shredded carrots and squeezed an orange on top. Oh, and I threw in the rest of the beer. This cut down on the unbearable heat, but still kept the great flavors this chili has. It ended up with just a little kick, rather than a ton. I will definitely make this chili again, but maybe next time with a little less tobasco sauce, hot chili beans, chili powder, cumin and  peppers and add more veggies, sugar and beer. My very picky chef husband loved it and said I had his permission to make it again if it tastes that good.

I followed the recipe accordingly and the only thing different I did was add more bacon bits (about two cups more). The chili turned out great, the many ingredients really play well together and make it really tasty and delightful! It had a little kick to it but nothing my 2 year old daughter could not handle! My husband absolutely loved it too! Thank you for sharing :)

This is a very good recipe i've made several time. I usually use less beans and more chili peppers.

For those that don't know, "chili pepper" isn't one certain kind of pepper. Chili pepper refers to the entire class of hot peppers.  You can use whatever you want in this recipe, depending on how spicy you like it.  I usually mix and match. This time I used 4 jalapenos and 1 serano.  I've used habeneros in the past too.

I have made this chili so many times, and it is still the most requested chili recipe that I have shared. I love that I can lessen or increase the spice "heat" by adding or subtracting the green peppers and Tabasco sauce. The flavor is great, though I do tend to toss in a bit more chili powder for a heavier chili flavor. I've yet to have anyone turn their nose up at it yet!

We loved this chili! For Christmas we actually made two pots of this; one with beans and one without. Both turned out wonderful but I do prefer the one with beans. Instead of using bacon bits we cooked a package of bacon and split it between the two pots. Also, we only used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of the full teaspoon. Since kids were eating this we did not want to make it too hot. We will be making this again!

I cut the recipe in half, because I'm only cooking for myself. This is a great, flavorful chili that improves as it sits. It's a tad on the salty side, so I might play with it to figure out how to cut back on the sodium in the future.

Made this a couple times.  Laugh at people who think it's too many ingredients or too much work.  It's what you do when you're aiming for not good but great :). This is great chili.

I pre-sauteed all the onion/garlic/peppers as others did - I can't imagine the texture being right without doing that.  Also, this original recipe as written makes a HUGE amount of food - I had trouble finding a pot to accomodate the volume!  Definitely cut in half if you are cooking a typical weeknight dinner in standard cookware.  Keep it the same if you have a gigantic pot to feed a crowd at a tailgate :)

Im not a "chili" person but I had a request for it.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for spicy, spicy stuff )& everyone raved about it!!!  I enjoyed it as well... with added cheddar melted on top.  I left out the green chili peppers because I didn't want it too hot & it was just right with just the right bite!!

This recipe is awesome, the only thing I changed was the beer, I used a cup of beer instead of half cup. I added chopped carrots and used scotch bonnets for my hot sauce. I used a slow cooker and cooked it for 8 hours.

I won a chili cook-off with this recipe.  I did not add the chili beans, but used kidney beans instead.  I also toned down the spice a bit so it would be kid-friendly.

My guy doesn't like onions or bell peppers so I had to do without.  I also didn't do tomatoes so just used the paste and then added tomato sauce.  It came out a bit salty so I just used the rest of the beer and some water and let it thicken.  It was great!

Pretty good chili.  I have made it twice now. My husband really enjoys it.  I didn't have any tobasco the second time so I used sriracha.  I found that to be better.  Also I add a tablespoon or so of powdered cocoa.

I would make this again for sure. My family loved it. But the only thing I would be a little careful about next time is the amount of chili powder, cayenne, and the hot sauce. It was a little too spicy for us and i would cut down the amount of chili powder and cayenne to half and taste it. If you need more you can always add before putting it to cook for 2 hours. all in all, great recipe.

MMMMMMM.....I was a little taken aback by the list of ingredients, but, really wasn't that bad at all.. This was a huge hit! I served it in sour dough bread bowls, topped with cheese and corn chips...Followed recipe to a tee cept omitted the celery. I almost cut back on the spices cuz I thought maybe it would be to spicy, but very glad I didn't. Defiantly even better the next day!! Thank You for posting! This is now my go-to chili.

We LOVE this chili!!  We do it pretty much as is and it is super yummy.  Last time however instead of just using the ground chuck and Italian sausage I also used Ground sirloin and ground brisket. It was to die for!  I would highly recommend that combination.

Fantastic! Have made a few times and everyone loves it. The list of spices/seasonings is long but that is what makes it so much better than any other chili I've made before discovering this recipe. I'm going to make it again today and have decided to create a big mix of all the dry seasonings and save it to cut down prep time when I make it again and again and again! Thank you mightypurdue22 for sharing!

Great texture, flavor and appearance.  You can always adjust the spiciness and heat as you want.  I make it every year for our annual chili cook off. I reduce the amount of chili beans (non spicy) to two cans instead of three.  What makes this recipe so good is that you can make these adjustments and still have a great meal.

Despite the ginormous amount of ingredients listed in order to make this wonderfully 5 star chili (plus the extra time needed to prepare it!), it was absolutely very worthwhile given its tremendous extra yum/wow/amazing results by *everyone* who was able to indulge in a bit of having some of it! Unquestionably told to be sure to make it again soon!

Good recipe if you are looking for a regular/traditional chili (traditional in the midwest at least).  There is no need for the beef bullion cubes, basically just adding lots of unnecessary sodium to an already heavily spiced/seasoned recipe.  Also skipped the bacon bits as there is plenty of meat and they tend to just get soggy in chili anyways.

This is the best chili I have ever tasted! I didn't have bacon, celery green peppers or green chile peppers,which I was going to add later, but it was good without these ingredients. I loved the addition of a little beer. This will be my new go to chili recipe!

Although this chili takes a long time to make- It's the BEST CHILI EVER! I make it each year for my squadron chili cook offs and share it with my neighbors each time I cook up a batch.  It is very tasty and this recipe yields enough to last a family of 5 about 4 days.

BEST CHILI EVER!  I have made this recipe for 3 chili cook-offs and have won 1st place every time.  I would say I pretty much followed the recipe, with the following exceptions for convenience/preference: I left out the celery, instead of 2 green chile peppers I use rotel for the diced tomatoes, I do not drain my chili beans.  I always make it the day before and reheat it before serving.  Really allows all the flavors to come together perfectly.

Wow this was good!  I didn't even have all of the ingredients and it was still fabulous.  I didnt have the beer, garlic,paprika, or corn chips.  I didnt use the tabasco but thank goodness I didn't, it was spicy enough!  My family reaaalllly enjoyed this recipe. Well worth the time it takes getting all of the ingredients together and prepped.

I really like this recipe it is a lot of ingredients but it's all about taste for sure. I only changed a couple of things for my taste. I used more fresh garlic, smoke paprika and apple wood bacon bits. For the bacon bits cooked the bacon and then let them cool put them in the food processor nice fresh real bacon bits. I also used some Hatch Green chilies from the summer that were roasted and froze really awesome green chiles the best. So maybe I did change it more than I thought just remembered I added black 2 cans of black beans and only 2 cans of chili beans. The spices are what really makes this chili taste bud friendly and delicious. Thanks for the great base of ingredients!!!!!

I used the calculator to cut this in half so was worried about the taste...it was still perfect! Don't let the canned beans throw you off...it does not taste like canned chili beans at all!!!  People rave about this dish!!

I read a few of the reviews & took a lil of this a lil of that... But overall it is a great recipe!!! Everyone loved it for a cold Monday night football game! The base recipe isn't spicy at all so i had to spice it up to our liking! Added a lil spicy brown mustard & instead if sugar i used brown sugar. I threw a can of hot rotel when i cooked the meats to season the meat. The idea of sauté your veges in bacon grease was a great idea so i cooked my own bacon & went from there! But I will defiantly make this again! Still get great reviews from my friends that came over.

Awesome recipe!  Won our neighborhood chili cook off today!  Used stewing beef instead of ground beef.  I substituted one of the cans of mild chili with one can of black beans.  Added a whole jalapeño.  Cooked for about three hours then refrigerated it overnight.  Put in the slow cooker in the morning and cooked it on low for another six hours.  They loved it!

Chili is a recipe that costs alot with quality ingredients and takes some effort to get right so when we make it we want it to turn out perfect. This is a decent recipe, but wasn't something you would look forward to pulling back out for seconds.

This was a great recipe that you can tweak to use what you have in the kitchen.  I used 1 lb. of deer meat, 1 lb. of veal and 1 lb. of Italian sausage.  I used smoked paprika and two tbl. of the chili powder and 2 tbl of chipotle pepper powder instead of all chili powder.  Like others, I sautéed the veggies in the bacon grease and added extra bacon.  Also, I only used 3 cans of beans.  Next time, I think I will use stew meat and Italian sausage....assuming I have it on hand :)  Overall,  great recipe!

I made this chili and my family and I were very disappointed. It was a waste of money to buy all the ingredients and then the chili turned out lousy. The biggest waste of money was the italian sausage ( with all the other seasonings you couldn't even taste it). Would not use this recipe again.

I've been looking for a good chili recipe and I can finally stop the search. I've followed the recipe almost to a tee. The only substitution worth mentioning is that I used chicken broth in place of the beer. I started out using 1/2 cup, the same amount as the beer, but I like my chili a little soupier so I added the whole can. That was three days ago. I was asked to make it again so I made a double batch today... that's A LOT of chili but I have no doubt every last bit will be eaten! SOON! Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe easy to make and it filled quite a few bellies. I had to use white beans because that was the only kind in my pantry. It was better the next day which is great because I made it ahead. Paired this with jalapeno corn bread.

This recipe have me a good starting base fir an awesome chili. Instead of Worcestershire sauce I used soy sauce. A little weird but it was an awesome compliment to it. I also omitted the beans because I don't think beans belong in chili (I'm from Texas after all), and I used ground Chuck with with the sausage and added ground turkey. It was a huge hit in my house. I also added a bit more spice and some red pepper flakes. I don't think I could have gotten this chili anymore perfect. I'm looking forward to making it again.

Very good!  A bit spicy for our liking.  This recipe takes quite a while to prepare with all the ingredients and the prep work involved.  I served it with corn chips, cheddar cheese and sour cream.  We took it camping in the fall and it was a welcome treat on a chilly afternoon!

This is the best chili recipe I have found that my entire family will eat!  The only thing I change is the number of beans (I use 1 can less) because my crockpot is filled to the top and I am afraid that 1 more can will cause it to spill over.

Phenomenal chili. Great amount of spice. I swapped chorizo for sausage and turkey for ground beef. Turned out fantastic! Highly recommended.

Really good recipe.  Made it for a tailgate at a packer game.I used the slow cooker instead of stove top the prior day and reheated over a grill at the game. So simple. So good!

I have made this chili many times and always tweak it to my liking. I add more bell pepper, use less meat (ground sirloin), use honey instead of white sugar, add a can of rotel type tomatoes/peppers to name a few and it is always out of this world! I have elbow mac on the side because I think it adds bulk and it's more comfort food that way. I also have garlic bread with it.

I gave up on chili years ago, couldn't get it right.  Finally this is the recipe that gets it right!  Great depth of flavor.  Kids gobbled it up with lots of compliments and didn't even try to pick out the green peppers!!  Thank you.

OH MY GOD.. THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD. I made this for a halloween party and nearly everyone went back for seconds.  I couldn't find chili beans in spicy sauce so I used medium sauce instead... hot sauce made up for this. Added a touch more Worcestershire.   Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, let it simmer for 3+ hours, stuck it in the fridge over night then let it simmer for another 2 hours before serving it. This is will be my staple chili recipe from now on...  can't wait to make it again!

I made this recipe last night for our church chili cook off and was given many compliments.  That said, I did make a few small changes to tweak it to my personal taste and preference. The meat consisted of cubed stew meat (chuck), a tube of mild pork sausage, sweet italian sausage and beef chorizo all browned and grease drained when finished. Separately in another pan, I added four diced bacon slices and as it began to cook and render the fat I added the onion and celery and half a stick of butter.  Once the onion was carmelized I dropped in diced jalapeno chile and green bell pepper to soften them a bit.  Instead of fresh red bell pepper I used a fire roasted variety from a jar. Once cooked al dente, I added them to the meat and included the remaining ingredients.  Instead of diced tomatoes I used fire roasted from a can and instead of the chili powder I used a cocoa chili powder and substituted smoked paprika in place of regular.  I also added an additional can of kidney beans and four small cans of diced green chile as well as a full beer instead of half. Hot sauce was substituted with Sriracha with the addition of 3 TB of course ground mustard. it was a bit hot so I added a small can of diced pineapple chunks to mellow the heat. The result was the best chili I have ever eaten if I do say so myself!

We made this for a chili cook-off and won!! haha  Of course we switched up a few things. We used 4 habanero peppers instead of the green chilis and used 1 lb beef cubed steak and 1 lb ground beef instead of the beef chuck. Everything else was the same. It has loads of flavor!!

I didn't use any beer, bouillon cubes, bacon, hot sauce, Worcester sauce, or green chilies. I used the Roti diced tomatoes with the green chilies I used the mild ones because my sausage was hot. Also, I bought the diced tomatoes with garlic basil and oregano I didn't want my chili blazing hot it turned out perfect for me it had a small tang with a lot of flavor. The toppings were amazing!!!

I've made this recipe several times now and love it! I keep forgetting to save some beer for it, so I add just a little water. This time one of the tomoato cans is Rotella with habaneros, and I used three jalapenos rather than the roasted green chili's I usually use, so we'll see how spicy/good this batch turns out. I have the feeling you can't really screw it up!

Loved this! I was hesitant using beer, so I dissolved the beef bouillon in 1/2 C of red wine. I also substituted Louisiana hot sauce for the tobasco. Everything else was amazing!

Wow, I am so glad I found this recipe. I left out the hot sauce so that the kids could eat it. It had great flavor. Husband really liked it!  I paired this with a sweet cornbread recipe from this site. Perfect fall supper.

This recipe makes A TON of chili, so before the simmering step put half in the freezer.  Instead of the 2 hours simmering, I put the remaining half in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.

Added extra cayenne, fresh thai peppers and sri racha sauce for heat and tang, then real maple syrup to balance it out.  Served with homemade cornbread.

Follow the recipe for the most part... I did not drain the beans, used habanero Tabasco, used tomatoes with green chilies in a can and  use fresh bacon I also sautéed onions and garlic in some of the bacon drippings and instead of tomato paste I used Mexican tomato sauce. Came out fantastic.

This is the best chili I've had. I use corn muffins instead of chips. The best part is the leftovers the next day. It makes a very large amount, but it doesn't last more than 24hrs in my home.Thank you!

The best chili I have ever had! We make this often for our family, divide it into three batches, and enjoy it many different ways. We leave out the cayenne and tabasco since we have several little people in our house. It's still very good.

I've made chili many, many times, but this is probably the best.

First, I reduced the recipe by half, which gave me a crockpot full of chili. I also used half the amount of jalapeno, just to make sure this wasn't too hot for my 9yr old. I used just a green pepper and did not include celery, since none of us like celery. I used one of my husband's "winter lager" homebrews for the beer. This simmered for several hours. We served ours with cheese, sour cream and corn bread. This was really good! I have some today for lunch and can't wait to see how much better it has become.

I used ground buffalo meat instead of beef and beef broth instead of bouillon cubes.  I also used feta and spinach sausage (I know sounds weird but it was great) and no tomato paste.  The flavor was amazing, this recipe is great for a base recipe you can modify for your own taste.  I used all the same spices and sauces.

This was a big hit at our house! I used habanero peppers and hot Italian sausage. It got hotter the next day. My husband loved it! This will definitely go into the rotation! Thanks!

I love this chili.  I have made it by the book and then several variations.  All the way around it's good.  I prefer to precook the onions and veggies (just depends on what I have on hand).  I also use different meats, chucks of steak or sausage or just ground beef.  Good with or without bacon.  Can skip a can of beans and not miss it, for my more anti bean fans.  Definitely try this and make it your own famous recipe!

I made this for my son and his college housemates. I doubled the recipe and underestimated the space I would need to cook it. Just the meat and beans alone filed my crockpot!! So I transferred everything to my canner pot and it filled it half way! Instead of cutting up chilies I just used cans of Rotel and cut back on the spices a bit and it was perfect! Not a drop left, they loved it!

A great chili recipe. I used some leftover hamburgers and sausages from a BBQ. They were all cooked (and a little burnt) so I froze all of the meat to use later. I boiled the burgs & sausages & chopped them up to put in the chili. I also added a few carrots and a couple of cans of corn, and a can of mushrooms, because I like those in chili. It turned out great!

Excellent!! I just substitute the beer with Marsala or Sangria wine. Very good!!Thank you for sharing!
Update* I use stew meat, ground turkey, chopped steaks and skip the ground beef. Oh, I almost forgot..I saute the veggies in bacon drippings and just put the bacon crumbled in the crock pot(instead bacon bits). Again, if there is no beer in the house, wine works as well.

I didn't use the bacon bits and forgot the celery.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce instead and doubled it (more flavor, but less spicy than Tabasco).  Other than that, I followed all other recommendations.

First time writing a review. This was pretty darn good chili... I sub half of the ground beef with stew beef (cut into small pieces). Added a little spicy brown mustard as another person suggested. I also added an extra can of beans because it didn't look like it was enough. Last thing I did differently was cook the meats separate from the veggies. Overall a great pot of chili with a little fire!!!

This was good, but I don't think it was worth all the shopping I had to do for the long list of ingredients.  My husband said he couldn't tell a difference between my regular chili and this recipe.  I'm going back to my simple chili.  Sorry :(

An excellent meat-lovers chili (especially since I halved this recipe but still used 2 lbs of meat).  NOTE: for those who find it too spicy, it gets milder the longer it sits. TIP: do not drain excess grease if you can help it and only use 80/20 beef if you want the authentic taste of chili houses.  

Also, I had no beer, only frozen bell peppers (no chili pepper), better than bouillon instead of cubes, no bacon bits and it was still wonderful ~ especially with my own cornbread!

So good. I use Johnsonville hot loose Italian sausage
because I like very spicy food. This is a keeper have made it for UFC night so many times. It feeds many and everyone is always satisfied thanks for sharing such a good recipe :)

It is great chili. I'll give it that... But so time consuming that I don't think I will bother with it again.. I've made chili that takes half the time and costs half the price that tastes just as good. 4/5 on taste.... 2 stars on $ and time involved

This chili is so very good. I followed the recipe as written using all the spices and added a few more dashes of tobacco and a few dashes of ancho chili pepper powder.  I used a 4oz can of diced green chili peppers and skipped the green and red peppers (just personal preference). We don't care for a ton of diced tomatoes so I only used one 28oz can and then added a large can of hunts tomato sauce.  I also used 3 cans of drained and rinsed pinto beans and 1 can spicy chili beans. I increased the beer to just about a cup. I put it in the crock pot and let it cook for several hours.  Served it with corn chips, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and some homemade corn bread. This is a nice change from my regular chili I have made forever, glad I found this recipe.

Basic. Not impressive. I don't see how it's winning contests. We didn't feel the greatest after eating it despite using fresh ingredients -- I think it was too much beer, beans, grease. It was a ton of work for chili that doesn't honestly taste much better than the stuff you can make in 30 minutes with an envelope of chili seasoning. We let it sit overnight and it didn't do anything to impress us then either.

I made this almost like it was printed, just left out the beer which I didn't have and used 3 lbs. hamburger meat and added some extra sage to make it like sausage, which I didn't have.  I had to use a 2 in. piece of real bacon diced up since I didn't have bacon bits.  My husband really liked it and so did my kids. I made this once with only 1 can of beans and 1 can of tomatoes and it was good that way too.  I don't think I will use any other chili recipe from now on.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count.  It is the best according to my husband and his friends.  The only thing I added differently was homemade Italian hot sausage which gives it kick!

The first time I made this I was trying to weigh my options between this one and a quick 30 minute chili recipe.  I am so glad I chose this one that day.  This has been my favorite chili recipe ever since.  I follow the recipe exactly.  I don't feel that there are any alterations needed. I have made it several times; sometimes just for a simple dinner and sometimes for game day.  We're total football fans in my house (GO COLTS!!!) and this chili screams football.  Thanks for the submission MIGHTYPURDUE22!

Way, WAY too salty!! If you can get pass the saltiness, you just *may* get to taste the bland flavor (or lack there of). Waste of time and money. We threw out 3/4 of the pot that was left after no one would eat it a second time. Sorry, but this is just pure garbage. I have no clue how someone would rate this 3 stars... let alone 5....

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it is very versatile.  I interchange ingredients as I go, usually substituting in black beans and adding ground turkey and trying different beers every time.  I've tried Modelo especial, Tecate, Pabst and today I'm trying an IPA.  Modelo has so far been the best complement to the flavors.  The base ingredients are spot on and I recommend after you try the original recipe to tweak it any way you see fit.  I make it in the slow cooker and usually use at least 24 oz of beer, so this recipe is very easy to make in the slow cooker also.

This is my first time making Chili, I thought it was great I did alter it a bit though. I did not have the fresh peppers but I had a package of dry salsa mix so I used that instead, I also left our the sausage and the bacon bits, these seemed odd ingredients for Chili, plus I used my pressure cooker instead of crock pot.  Everyone loved it, my son,  husband and I, I plan to make it again.

I've made this recipe several times and love it.  I actually took all of the "chopped" veges and threw them in the food processor instead of actually chopping them.  Turned out great and the kids didn't have to see the veges that were all still in there.

I make this recipe all the time. Many ingredients but well worth it. Instead of 2 lbs. ground beef I add 1lb. Ground beef and 1 lb. stewed beef cubes. I also cut down on the hot ingredients.  Delish!

Great recipe! My changes... excluded the bacon and also excluded the chili peppers as I thought it might be just a tad too spicy. Made it in the crockpot and let it cook for over 6 hours on low. Used about half the beans. I've made the recipe twice now and delicious both times. Huge hit at both parties that it was brought to and not a drop left!

Loved this chili!  After making a few times, I have settled on a few modifications:  I add 1 T cocoa, and leave out the cayenne and tabasco.  Some of my family members find it too spicy with the cayenne and tabasco.

I used all the spices as suggested.  I didn't use pepper because my husband is not a fan, and I used extra ground beef instead of Italian sausage.  It turned out excellent!!  This will be the chili recipe for us from now on.

This is my "go to" chili recipe, i was asked to enter in a chili cook off at work and found this recipe here, won second place, not bad for an unexperienced chili maker. Now I make it every year. I make mine in the crockpot on low for 8 hours just cook and drain the meat and sausage and put everything in the crockpot, I do use 3 14oz cans of the tomatoes that have seasoning already, i like the ones with garlic and cumin on it. I don't add any sugar,worcestshire or tabasco sauce.
I add a chopped serrano pepper and  blend 1 chipotle pepper with the tomatoes. By the way I live in Texas and all my Texas friends love this chili.

I only mixed in half of what the recipe called for and fed my entire office of 10 (others brought in chili too though), my family of four, and the neighbors and I still had leftovers. It was a perfect blend of flavors and thickness. Only changes were that I mixed in venison instead of ground beef and hot Italian sausage instead of regular sausage. Let it cook for about 12 hours and it will definitely be going into my recipe book. Side Note: This was my first attempt at making and it was real easy.

I cooked this chili for the Church Chili Cook off (which I sponsor) and it took third place, it had a great flaor and the secret is to lay out all ingredients at the beginning.

Great Chili! A lot of ingredients but worth it. Different textures, from the beans to the meats to the crunch of bell peppers, gives you a taste of varity & a rewarding outcome of your time & money into this Chili.

I have never made a chili from scrartch...more like chili meat and can beans..lol..but I tried this one and my family and I LOVED IT!!! Even my kids...I am a picky eater and so is one of my daughters...anything that has pepper in it my daughter doesnt like it...but this chili here she LOVED even asked for seconds. I took some to my job for my co-workers to taste.. since we are having a chili cook off (Texas we love our chili) and my co-workers loved it..I hope we win second place..the texture of the chili was great..it was spicy and flavorful..I didnt use the spicy beans and I used a salt free gluetin free beef bouillon. Overall we love it and I have added it to my cook book. Thanks! A huge high five to you

I was a bit hesitant about this recipe after reading a couple of the poor reviews but there were so many positive ones, i felt it was worth a try. Im SO happy that i did! Just had a sample taste and wow...love it! The only change: Anything that I think I can use in my crockpot, I do...so, it is slow cooking right now.  I cooked up the meat and veggies on the stove top and then added everything to my crockpot. If this sample bowl tasts this good without simmering, i know its going to be good in a few hours. This will be my 'go to' chili recipe. Thanks so much for sharing....I can't wait for my family to taste it!

I made this with a couple of minor changes for a chili contest and won the crowd favorite category. It is awesome, I like my chili a little looser so I added a can of tomato juice and extra cayenne pepper.  I also used hot Italian sausage and powered garlic instead of minced garlic.  Was not too hot, just spicylicious.

Made this chili - 1/2 recipe - used only one can of spicy chili beans and added some cubed beef chuck roast (about 1/2 lb) - used canned chili peppers and I did as others suggested and fried the bacon and then the veggies in the bacon grease.  Everything else as written.  An excellent recipe, well worth all the ingredients and preparation if you really want an amazing chili.

This Central Texas gal won a chili cook off with this recipe. It was a great hit. I do not know how to make chili well on my own, so I was very surprised when I won the contest, especially because they had about 50 others to choose from. I will for sure you this again. The only change I made was instead of the beer I used beef stock. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I tripled this recipe to freeze for future meals, and pretty much followed the recipe. The only change I made was to add some frozen cubes of homemade beef stock and used taco peppers instead of chili peppers, and left out the beer. For the quantity that I made, I can't say if adding a couple of tablespoons of some of the herbs and spices made a difference, but the result was excellent. My husband and even my 92 year old mother love it. I will definitely make it again even though it was a project that took a whole day. I did let it simmer for 5 hours to meld all of the flavors and seasonings.

I followed this recipe without any changes. I let it simmer all day, about 7 hours then served and we LOVED it! Even the four picky kids we have! Made plenty for leftovers the next day which I loved! This is a keeper!

Incredible! We made this a day ahead of time for our super bowl party and there were no leftovers. We used moose chuck and caribou italian sausage and kicked it up a notch with habenero peppers. We also used 2 bottles of beer, cause why not! I can't wait to make this again

I did not change a thing. If you like spicy chili that has fantastic flavors, this is the one for you. I love that you can actually taste all the ingredients added. It sounded crazy to me to add the sugar but really it added a really nice flavor. I would not change a thing!!!!!!

I really like this recipe for a classic, very meaty chili. I don't eat a ton of beef. So, I substituted turkey sausage, ground turkey, and ground pork, and it was yummy! It makes A TON though! I also think it would be better (for my tastes) with more vegetables.

This was a more complicated chili recipe than the usual, and I did not find that it was any more spectacular than ones I've made in the past.  Not worth all the extra effort, but not a bad chili either.

I made this for our annual Superbowl Party and it was a major hit!  People loved it.  I liked the fact that it had some kick but didn't burn my lips off, as I like to enjoy the flavor of food rather than just be burned out.  Brought a huge crockpot of it and it was all but gone by the time we left.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is great chili!  I modified it slightly, using 1 jalepeno and one anaheim pepper, an orange pepper vs. green pepper based on availability and the specifics of Fireman's 4 as the beer.  And then I won the church Chili cookoff!   Fun!  The depth of the flavors are really outstanding, it has a nice but not overwhelming heat too.  I am back online to see if anyone found a way to thicken it up just a tad, but it's outstanding as is too!

All you can taste is the canned chili beans. You cannot taste any of the other flavors. I won't take the time to follow this recipe again.

By far one of my all time favorite chili's to make!! Family and friends LOVE it. Served it at my garage sale this past fall and sold more chili than anything eles! Actually had a couple get some, leave and sent their family back for more!! a local fireman asked for the recipe and won a chili cook off with it!

Absolutely Delicious. A few things I did differently: I used 1 lb. of ground beef, 1 lb of ground hot Italian pork sausage and a lb. of cubed beef/steak, I put a whole can of amber ale, I doubled the garlic. I also cooked it the day before and simmered for about 4-6 hours, refridgerated overnight. I put it back on the stove and simmered for a  few hours before serving the next day. It's the only chili I'll ever make again.

I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve made this!  It is just so so so good and I have shared this recipe with dozens of guests!  My only changes are omitting the bacon and celery and adding a can of corn. I’ve even made it without meat and extra beans for some of my vegetarian friends. Also, when I’m feeling healthy, I use ground turkey instead and it is just as delicious!

I have made this chili many times, and everyone has always loved it.  I was asked to make this for Superbowl this weekend.  If the chili gets a little thick for your liking, I would add more beer or some chicken stock.  Overall LOVE this recipe.

I followed the recipe for the most part, might of forgotten 1 or 2 things,(lots of ingrediants) substituted one or two things, and oh, I put it in the crockpot.  But it was the best chili I ever made.  Tons of compliments and I made it for a fantasy football party!  (that means mostly guys)  It had a nice kick but not too hot so everyone was happy.  A new favorite for sure.  Thank you for sharing.

Good chili, but way TOO SALTY! I didn't even add the salt, but 4 cubes of bouillon is overkill!! Next time, I'll just add one, or skip the bouillon.

This turned out awesome in my house.  I left out the green chili's because I didn't have them and I only had hamburger meat and kidney beans but otherwise I followed the recipe and everyone loved it.  :D  Thanks for sharing.  This was my first attempt at homemade chili and it was awesome!!!  :D

This stuff is great. I have made it twice, and both times the people absolutely raved about it. Planning another get together soon, and will serve this chili. The only change I had to make was to use canned chilis since I couldn't find fresh ones. It was yummy.

Basically cooked this as it is called for except that I left out the red/green peppers, used one extra green chili, and used a slightly different combination of beans.  Loved it!  Definitely will make it again.

Lots of work for a chili recipe.  Not crazy about the Italian sausage.  It makes a ton so use a really large pot.  I think I may stick to my chili starter (Carroll Shelby's) and doctor it up.  Much easier and better.

I tried this recipe tonight and my husband says, it's the best chili he ever had.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, just added some of my own little "twists": I used 1.5 lbs hot Italian sausage and 1.5 lbs 93% lean ground beef.  Added 2 habaneros in addition to the other veggies (we like our chili hot)!  Sauteed all the veggies (using olive oil cooking spray) prior to adding them to the pot. (I always do this when adding veggies to sauces, think it adds a great flavor). Put the 4 beef boullion cubes in 1 cup of water, boiled it, and threw that in the pot.  The beer I used was PBR.  Also I only used about 1.5 tbsp of chili powder (thinking I could always add more later if need be, but that turned out to be enough for me).  So just a few small tweaks, other than that followed the recipe exactly, and it's a keeper!  Thanks!

This Chili was AMAZING, we didn't add the bell peppers and threw in some serrano chilies and Tapatio. Just the right amount of spice. We both agreed we'd make this one again

We made this on Christmas Eve for 8 people. It was out of this world delicious!   The only thing I did
differently was put everything in the crock pot at 10:30 a.m. and served it at 6:30 pm.  This is a definite
keeper!

The only adjustment we make is to sometimes omit pepper seeds for those who cannot tolerate spicy food.  Otherwise, this is perfection.

LOVED IT!  I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of the chili powder.  I could tell it was going to be too spicy as I added the incredients so I cut the chili poweder amount in half.  It was still pretty spicy until I reheated it the next day.  Now I wonder if I should of added all the chili powder :).  Enjoy!

I made a vegetarian version of this and it was the best chili I have ever had! I used brown ale for the beer and "browned" vegetarian crumbles and vegetarian breakfast sausage (Lightlife) before adding it to the chili and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  It was delicious!

I'm using this recipe for my 5th annual family chili competition. I did a lot of searching around and experimenting with different ingredients and this one looks pretty promising. I just finished my first trial batch and have to say I am not blown away. Although it does taste VERY good. I switched it up a little bit so its probably my fault. I used 2/3 of a serrano pepper and added some cajun spice to it.I used half yellow and then a white onion. This is a VERY good recipe but Im competing with people who are using exotic meats etc. After tasting it from simmering for awhile I am prepared to go to war with it. I would say that maybe 4 boullion cubes is too much because it seems a little salty. maybe 3 cubes or 2 1/2 or grade down from the salt requirement. i thought maybe since this is a tailgate chili that everyone would be drinking beer so the salt would be a good thing. there will be alot of drinking going on during this competition so maybe it works out. overall i would like to say thank you for this recipe and i apologize for mixing it up a bit but down south here we need some more spices. I think i will win 1st place if not place 2nd or 3rd out of 8 entries. this is a good recipe just go easy on the salt. merry christmas... time to eat some chili!! BTW I won 2nd first year 2nd second year 5th 3rd. no entry last year. Completely going in with something different this year. thanks.

This has been a great recipe for me to use as a reference when making my chili, though I've never followed the whole thing. I always skip the bacon bits, usually the beer too, and just started dumping the spices in instead of measuring. This turns out GREAT every time, and just as good in a fast pressure cooker. I also use a pound of ground turkey instead of the beef and italian sausage. I usually don't have small peppers around, but I love adding a can of black beans with jalapeños, one can of chili beans, and one of kidney beans, just for variety.  If you want to add something to make up for there being less meat, you can add garbanzo beans for more protein (and you can easily make the whole pot vegetarian).

This is my all-time favorite chili recipe!  The vast list of ingredients is necessary for the incredible complex flavors.  I don't normally like chili because most I've tried is just beans in tomato sauce, but this one takes the cake!

I make a few adjustments to suit our tastes (less cayenne and hot pepper, eliminate the bell paper and celery) but for the most part, I follow it to a T and we are never disappointed!

Amazing chili! I've made this so many times and it always impresses. To those who say they didn't like it, or it wasn't "authentic" enough. I'd love to see them post a recipe that could top it. Maybe it didn't win best chili in El Paso, but I certainly haven't seen a better recipe on here. Thanks so much for your time and effort MightyPurdue22, I'm not a great cook but this helps me fake it! Well worth the effort and time.

Excellent base recipe for me, but like many of the other people that made this, I made a few changes.  I replaced a can of diced tomatoes with a can of Rotel. I also used cubed deer meat instead of ground beef and Italian sausage.  I used about 12oz of beer instead of 1/2 cup.  I also replaced the chile peppers with jalapenos.  I sauteed peppers, onion, and garlic together before putting it in the slow cooker.  It came out great!!

To die for.
Made a big enough batch to fill an 18 quart roaster and took it to work for the guys. Didn't even make it until lunch time. They want more.
Thanks for the great recipe.

For someone who isn't a huge chili eater, I was a little skeptical...but, it was really good!  The only thing I might change next time is the use of less chili powder.  I left out the beer but followed everything else to the 't'.  Good chili and lots of good reviews from my guests.

My husband loved this chili. The only changes I made were to make it hotter.  I used hot italian sausage and added 4 serrano and 2 jalapeno peppers.  Be aware, if you do this, the next day, this will be very spicy.  We loved it!  We made enough to freeze.

Best chili ever! I normally don't like chili but I LOVED this recipe. I think it's the Italian sausage that gave it the extra oomph? Not sure but it'll definitely be on my rotation.

Excellent!  I had never made homemade chili before and took this to a church chili cook off and won- there were about 40 entries.  I was the only person who took home an empty crock pot!!

Super yummy!  I added half a cup of Guinness, and used chicken Italian sausage to lower fat content..  Made it in the crockpot on Saturday, ate it on Sunday.  My husband likes it spicier, so he added Tabasco to his- added to my recipe box!

This is a winner.  Wasn't sure what was meant by green chili peppers.  I used jalapeno peppers.  I added an extra can of beans and 1 tsp of cinnamon.   I used hot italian sausage, it really added some great flavor.

This is a great recipe. During the deer hunting season I substitute the beef for the deer meat. Also I use spicy turkey sausage to make it a little healthier.

very, very good.  Two comments though.  1  it is very spicy and 2 it makes a lot of chili.  I used a 7 quart dutch oven and it was too small.  I'll have to get a larger pot or halve the recipe next time.

I made this for a family get together and because I needed the stovetop for other things, after browning the beef, I transferred it to a slow cooker and mixed in the remaining ingredients.  I cooked it on low for a few hours rather than simmering it on the stovetop.  Everyone really liked the flavor but I wasn't too happy with the consistency, as the slow cooker broke everything down too much.  I prefer a more chunky-style chili.  Lesson learned - next time I'll simmer it on the stovetop as instructed.

Great recipe. The video suggests adding a jalapeno, which I thought was a good idea. I also cooked real bacon and crumbled in more than the suggested amount. I don't like store-bought bacon bits. I listened to another reviewer and added a full can of beer, however, I think I'll stick to the half can next time.

I tried making this for the first time for football Sunday company. My brother and boyfriend loved it! It has a good kick of spice. Everyone was going back for seconds and thirds. It tasted even better for lunch as left overs the next day. I plan on making this many more times in the future.

This was the first time I had made home made chili. I know crazy hugh. I've decided that I won't even try other recipes because this turned out to be the best chili I've ever had. The only thing I tweaked was downsizing it for two. Served it up with some beer bread. Very easy and just the right amount of everything. YUM!!!

This recipe is a great recipe.  I would not change a thing.  My family and Guests said this is the best chili ever that they have eaten. Guests even asked us for them to take some home.  For me, I couldnt move after dinner since I couldnt stop eating since it was soooooooo sooooooo good.  Thank you for sharing with us the out-of-this-world recipe.

OMG!!! This was the best chili EVER! My family loved it. I didn't have celery,bacon bits or beef cubes and it still tasted AWSOME. I mixed it up the night before and had my husband put it in the crock pot on low. It cooked for about 10 hours and was amazing. The next night we did chili dogs and chili cheese fries and they were great too. My family is still talking about it. THANK YOU :)

Really enjoyed the flavor of this chili. Easy to prepare. I used 1 can light red kidney's, 1 can dark red, and 1 can black beans. I also used 1/2 beer, and added one cup of water as it continued to simmer. Very good classic chili.

This was a great recipe.  I personally don't like the flavor of canned tomatoes so substituted a jar of pasta sauce (Roasted garlic marinara) instead of the canned tomatoes.  Was a huge hit.  Thank you for sharing.

This chili is SO good it's crazy. I made a few changes and it's been a huge hit with my family. I use spicy sausage, black beans, kidney beans and red beans in sauce, chopped carrot instead of celery, a jalapeno, real pan-fried bacon crumbled in rather than bacon bits, and corn. No tabasco sauce. It's good!

Really good! Here is what I did: I cooked 3 ckn breasts in a slow cooker with half a huge onion chopped/1 can cream of ckn soup, then shredded it.  In giant slow cooker I threw in the shredded chicken, 1 cut up smoked sausage, 2 cans rotel, 1 28oz can baked beans with bacon, 1 30oz can brooks hot beans with chili, 2 15oz cans wolf chili no beans, 1 15oz can hot hormel chili, 1 small can green chiles, other half of the huge onion chopped, 1 green pepper chopped, 1 red pepper chopped, i kept adding the seasonings to taste until it was hot enough (I think I probably doubled the seasonings, and added hot sauce to taste and saracha). I did NOT add any extra salt because the chili beans have a ton of salt already. I set it on low in the slow cooker for a couple hours, then set to warm the rest of the day until dinner.  The chili got a little soupy, but taking the lid off the slow cooker made it thicken back up! Will def make again thank you! *I totally forgot to add in turkey bacon as planned, will do that next time. Men like bacon it pleases them lol

This is one of the best chili recipes. I thought the recipe serving for 12 would be to much but we ate the whole pot! It was great on the first night and even better the second day.

I'm trying to redeem the rest of us Texans from the one in El Paso who was pretty ugly about this recipe.  We Texans shouldn't be bundled all up in one category.  I cooked this yesterday and it was wonderful.  The only things I did different was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I sauteed the veges in the meat as it cooked.   I did make a version of this without the tabasco for the kids. This is going to be my go to recipe for chili it is delicious!! Everyone ( all 9 of us Texans at my house ) raved about it.

This was the best chili recipe I have ever made.  There were only a few changes I made. I did not put in the green and red bell pepper, I added about another two tablespoons of chili powder and I added 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. I add vinegar to almost everything for it brings out such wonderful flavors. I simmered my chili for three hours.  I made it last weekend and will make it again at the request of my 15 year old daughter who loved loved it. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Really good chili.  It was very hearty and tasted great.  I did add in a few jalapenos to spice it up.  If u don't like spicy chili then the leave it the way it is and its perfect.  Great for parties or if u have a big family.

I won a chili cook off with this recipe.  I did make some changes though.  I only used 1 lb of ground beef (or ground sirloin) instead of 2 lbs.  Make sure you use Jimmy Dean italian sausage.  I also added one can of black beans and reduced the chili beans to 2 cans.  Also, add 1/3 a cup of ketchup to the mix.  I added one can of hot rotel as well, to give it some heat.  As stated in the recipe, the longer you can let it stew, the better it will taste.  I usually go a minimum of 4-5 hours of stewing.  It's even better if you cook the night before, then refridgerate, and reheat the next day.

This recipe, just as it's written, is a staple in our house.  The only modification I ever make is to make it more/less spicy depending on the crowd.  It's got alot of ingredients, but it's worth the effort...we LOVE this one!

I just made this chili and it was awesome! Instead of italian sausage I used beef smoked sausage, diced it and fried it up a bit before adding it in. I also cooked the ground beef separately, then added all the ingredients to my stock pot. I used two hungarian peppers instead of chili peppers, just a preference. Two cans of mild chili beans and two cans of kidney beans. Also I used a cup of beer, instead of just half a cup. This definitely has a kick to it, but that is why I love it!

Really REALLY REALLY GOOD!

Although I did change a bit in this recipe. I added more celery and instead of ground chuck--I used 2 1/2lbs of chuck steak cut into  small cubes (I tried to stay the same size as all the veggies as well). I didn't have any beef bouillon so I had to omit it. Instead of bacon bits I used two strips of bacon. So... lets do a bit of changing.

I began by cutting up the two strips of bacon into smaller pieces then putting it in the stock pot with a bit of vegetable oil. Fried it a bit until slightly brown. Put the diced onions in and cooked until transparent. Then added the chuck steak. THEN I added the Oregano, basil, and garlic. Stirred it up a bit then added all the vegetables (celery and the green+red bell peppers). Didn't use green chili peppers or Jalapenos. Let them cook a bit in the bacon fat and added everything else. And as a little treat I threw in some sweet corn (drained) yum~~~

Turned out super awesome!

Really excellent. I was tired of my old chili recipe and decided to try this. Instead of Italian sausage I added chopped flank steak. Unfortunately I accidentally threw in a ton of cheyenne pepper, thinking it was chili powder! It was SO spicy the kids couldn't eat it. BUT we still agreed that it had super flavor under the heavy spice and I'm going to try it again tonight with a little less spice!

this recipe is awesome!! i did omit the celery though, cause were not a huge fan..but i enjoyed it, as did my dad, and his coworkers... I did make a few adjustments though.. more of everything.. but only 1lb of the ground chuck and 1lb of the sausage..but dont skimp on the meat like i did.. it makes a big difference..also i dont think doubling the beer is necessary. I did and loved it but my dad didnt like the beer taste. I used a can of Coors. I used real bacon. I simmered all ingredients for a few hours then refrigerated and simmered for a few more the next day. I used like 8 pieces of bacon as well.also i did not drain any of the beans and used probably 5 or 6 cans of beans and atleast 4 cans of the diced tomatoes..but still only one thing of the tomato paste. If it isnt to ur liking keep adding a pinch here and a pinch there of your fav ingredients.. Enjoy!!!

Great Chili, thanks!  tried it for my first time for a company chili cook-off and placed 3rd, so I was happy with it.  It tastes great, with just a touch of heat on the back of the throat after swallowing, which is perfect.  Had others asking for the recipe as well.  I didn't have beer handy, so I put in apple cider as a substitute.

My husband and brother-in-law loved it! I cut out a few peppery things, and it was still a little spicy, but tasted wonderful! My husband got sausage link at the grocery store as well, and it still tasted great! First try at chili and it made me look like a chef rockstar!

Great base, except I used ground turkey, smoked turkey sausage and one less can of diced tomatoes. I also cooked it in a crock pot on low for about 3.5 hours.

Made this for my family and in-laws and it was a great success.  Followed it exactly except for switching the Italian sausage for pork sausage and it turned out wonderful served with Fritos and lots of shredded Cheddar cheese.  Will try it with Italian sausage next time to see the difference in taste.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Don't eat this the first day!! It's okay the second... best the third, or frozen and then reheated! Yes, it's work, but it's delicious and worth it. If I make the full recipe, I have leftovers x10 AFTER I share some with the family. This is a keeper.

I halved the recipe and used 1 1/4 lb of turkey. Still very good, but I will now try it with the ground beef and sausage.

This recipe was very tasty - I did tweak it a bit. I used only a pound of ground turkey and omitted the sausage and bacon bits (I don't eat beef and don't care for pork). I thought 1 pound of turkey was plenty. I also used a whole bottle of beer and omitted the corn chips. We ate half and froze the rest. Can't wait to have it again!

Have made this chili 2 times within 2 months this year and will be making it again soon.  Time consuming, but well worth the trouble.  I put all the ingredients it called for and found it to be just right in spice.  We like something with a little kick and this chili had that.

Made last night - took FOREVER! but well worth it. I used ground beef-less tomatoes because I didnt have them. Everything else was according to recipe. I simmered two hours last night. Put in crock pot today on low- then on warm after it was well simmered. My husband who loves his chili said it was the best he ever had!

It was DELICIOUS!! The grocery store near me did not have chili peppers so I used jalapenos; otherwise, I did everything as directed and it was perfect! My parents stopped by and weren't going to have any because my mom "isn't a big fan of chili", but when they walked in and smelled it, they decided to have some. My mom is now a lover of this chili and my dad finished off two large bowls! We thought it had the perfect amount of spice...wouldn't change a thing!! Thank you to the creator of this!!!!

It's just okay. I made it exactly as printed and simmered for three hours. It was still runny. More like a pasta sauce than a chili. I even took the lid off for the last hour, but it still didn't thicken up like I like. I've made better more cheaply on the fly. I do like all the veggie adds and will do that to my regular chili recipe from now on. I agree there's too much salt. No need.

This chili beats out my previous "go to " recipe. I've made it three times now. I changed a few little things the first time based on ingredients I had on hand ... Like instead of adding the bacon bits later, I chopped up the bacon into lardons and sautéed the onion and peppers together with the bacon then added to the meat, tomatoes, spices, etc. Also used chipoltle red cayenne red pepper which gave it a nice smokey hint. Prepared exactly as written, this is a mild and flavorful chili, which I prefer, but of course you can add the heat at the end.

Made chili for the first time. Chose this recipe because of the ratings. I followed the original posted recipe exactly (except I simply forgot to add the hot sauce) It was a tad bit too spicy (for me, not my family) So I added a little bit more sugar and it is PERFECT. Will continue making this recipe often for my family. We LOVE it! Yum!

Made this for a chili party and it was a huge success!! Not much left over!  Note: did not use Worcestershire sauce, cumin, or Paprika. I ran out if chili powder only just a few teaspoons, though it had enough flavor. I would def NOT use the 1/4 cup it recommends. Used a can of diced green chilis.

I made this chili for a footall game.  I did change it up a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used 1 can of red kidney beans plus 2 cans of black beans, rinsed and drained, instead of the 3 cans of chili beans.I used several extra shakes of hot sauce to make up for the heat.  It was awesome!  We loved it!

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!! have collected and tried dozens of chili recipes over the years...some good, some bad...some well, you know.  this is the best of the best.  made some minor changes, i.e. no celery, no bacon bits, no teaspoon of salt (plenty of sodium in other ingredients), and used three cans of small red beans (two of which i drained)in place of chili beans.  plenty of heat from the two teaspoons of tabasco.  recommend this to anyone who likes chili.  they won't be disappointed.

We halved the recipe, but still kept several of the spices at the recommended full recipe amount.  The chili had a great flavor.  Also, I couldn't find chili peppers in the produce section of the grocery store, so we just added a can of the chipped green chilies.  We both really like our chili hot, so we still needed to add hot sauce in the end, but it was fantastic!  Looking forward to the leftovers!

Really liked it and only did a few things different ... Omitted the beer, added a Serrano pepped w/seeds and spooned it over noodles. We love noodles and chili. My pot was almost not big enough as it really makes a large batch. Will make it again. First time I ever follow a recipe for chili and I'm glad I did.

This recipe did not disappoint.  Made only slight modifications to increase the beer (x2), garlic (x3), and bacon (x3).  Cooked 2.5 hours and every time I taste the chili, the flavor is improved dramatically, from first-taste to later that evening to next day.

This was good enough to make again, maybe just a little too much tomato paste for my taste. I might omit it next time. Used kidney and pinto beans because there the kind we like.

Excellent. I've used this recipe several times, and it's always a hit.  I use ground turkey instead of beef and sausage.  After it simmers, I start to modify it to my taste...surprisingly I tend to add more spice.

THE BEST CHILI RECIPE EVER! It has great bones and every time I make it, people go in for seconds and sometimes even thirds :). I like to make it in a  big batch like the original recipe calls for because I love having leftovers of it to eat all week! I do omit the green peppers though because I'm not a fan of them cooked, in my opinion they take over the whole dish. I also omit the celery and kick the spice up a little just based on my taste. So great though and I always get so many compliments!

I made this chili, as-is, for a chili cook-off at work and took home first prize. I usually make my chili with jalapeno peppers, but I went with this recipe since not everyone likes that much kick. I think I'm a convert to not having jalapeno's in the chili.

The only real changes I made were, to add 2 cans or red beans instead of 3 and I couldn't find Italian sausage, so I used Jimmy Deans sausage instead. I also fudged and added more bacon bits and a bit more cayenne.

Overall, it's been one of the best chili's I've had and the pot I took to work was gone in minutes. Everyone loved it.

FANTASTIC chili recipe.  I made several changes:  I replaced the 2 lbs. of ground beef with 2 lbs. of chopped home-smoked brisket (hickory wood).  I also added 1 tbs. jerk spice seasoning and 1 teas. habanero powder.  This chili rules.

Delicious.  I used the meat and tomatoes as written.  Used a whole bottle (12 oz) of beer for a double batch.  Used 6 cans of beans for the double batch.  1/2 c. chili powder, 6 bouillon cubes, 1 tsp pepper, no salt, 1 tsp. tabasco and 1/2 tsp cayenne.  Oh, and no chili peppers.  Probably could have used another 1/4 tsp cayenne and another 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of Tabasco.  Still, it was great!  Lots of work, but great.  Maybe could stay at the same spices I used if I would use a can of spicy chili beans, but I used all mild chili beans.  Also, it was too big a recipe for 1 pot so I filled the crock pot and the stock pot on the stove.  The pot on the stove turned out much nicer.  I mixed them though, and it all ended up great.

I've used my mother's chili recipe for years and years and didn't think it could get any better. Well...this is better!! The fresh veggies in this are fantastic and it has an excellent blend of spices. I added a can of Rotel for a little extra kick, but it didn't need it at all. The prep time is a little more because you have to chop the veggies and there are quite a few spices to throw in, but it is SO worth it and this makes a huge batch. The sausage is also a great addition. I couldn't find italian sausage, so I just used browned and crumbled mild sausage in mine and it was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again and again!!

I made this for a birthday celebration and it was a hit! I doubled the recipe but not the "warm" spices and it was perfect! I made it the evening before the event and placed it in a crockpot the next morning on the low setting.
we did not do the cheese or chips and instead used oyster crackers. This is a hit for sure!

Kicked my recipe to the curb after trying this! A-MAZE-ING! I stuck to the recipe pretty well, minus the cayenne, which left a little kick without turning the kids away, then added a little to my own bowl after. I did the slow cooker for six hours, and was a little worried when it produced a slightly bland taste test, but I listened to other reviews and chilled it for a few hours...reheat, and BAM! This stuff was PERFECT!

Made this when I got home from Maine and wanted something spicy.  Sep 2012 Did everything as in the recipe but only 1/2 green and 1/2 red pepper.  Used the Regular Chili Powder from Penzey's.  4 cans diced tomatoes and 4 cans beans.  1/2 of lg jalapeno peeled and seeded, 2 stalks celery and 5 slices cooked bacon with about 1 Tbsp of bacon grease.  Next time will saute the veggies in the grease as recommended by others.  Used about 1/2 of a Boulevard Wheat beer and instead of bouillon cubes used a can of beef broth

I like this better than regular chili. My husband thinks it's too thick. But he also puts peanut butter in his, yuck. I think the sausage gives it a better flavor.

I've made this twice now, for big groups of a friends to eat after a day of skiing. I added more spice but otherwise followed this recipe. It's a keeper.

This is the best chili EVER!  Has potential to be quite spicy, so in an effort to appeal to all tastebuds, especially kids, I only use half the tabasco and half the cayenne.  This chili gets raves everywhere I serve it.

This is the best chili to make if you have lots of time, and lots of chili lovers. The leftovers keep well, and can even be served over hot dogs. I usually let this simmer for 4 hours, even though the kids start eating it after 2. Although I usually make a much simpler chili with very few ingredients, this recipe is our very favorite. This recipe is also very forgiving, and substitutions or additions can easily be made. I saw some reviews saying this is too spicy: please don't forget that the chili powder is the chili spices, and not chili pepper. They are not at all spicy. If you add 1/4 cup powdered chili you will have an extremely spicy chili (that's how much I use when I make 10lb of kimchi, which is extremely spicy)

Wow!  Finally a killer chili recipe.  My husband and I attend a yearly chili cookoff and this one would definitely win!  The only thing I changed was that I used beef chuck and cut it up instead of ground beef chuck.  I did this because I bought the wrong kind of beef but it actually turned out great!  Fabulous recipe!

Great recipe!! The only improvement that I have found is to use diced venison instead of beef. This actually adds another layer of depth to the flavor. This is the first thing I cook every year, when deer season comes around.

Winner of 3 chili cookoff,s, this is awesome. I omit bell peppers and celery, because, blah. I add a lot chili powder, cumin, slap your mama, Dizzy Dust, pepper, and salt. This recipe is even better if you add additional seasonings. I also use fresh roasted Hatch green chile and tomatoes.

Very good Chili - even better as leftovers.  I used jalapeno peppers rather than chilis and omitted hot sauce.  It still had a bit of sneaky heat at the end of each bite.  We are trying to scale back the heat a little    by playing around with some of the spices.  All in all, a great recipe that will be used frequently!

I have been using allrecipes for years but I have never commented on one but this one - I need to!!  This is by far the BEST recipe!  A lot of flavor, it gets better the longer you cook it.  My teenage boys & husband cannot get enough of this chili.  I love putting it in a crock-pot and have it waiting for us after a long day of fall/winter sports.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good. I omitted the beef bouillon because of the sodium, but it was great without it. A little mild kick to it, but not hot at all to heat lovers. We thought it was just right. Great chili recipe.

Good recipe! I never stick to a recipe but I did use all of the spices and sauces in this one and it turned out yummy! I omitted the sausage and used ground beef. I also used a jalepeno instead of green chiles, and left out the celery, red bell pepper and bacon bits simply because I didn't have any. After trying the finished chilli my boyfriend said that he had his doubts about it while I was cooking(since I don't follow recipes exactly) but it was good! =)

This recipe was a big hit.  My local grocery store didn't have Italian sausage so I used regular sausage.  Delicious.

I doubled this recipe for a bunch of friends that were helping build our deck and it was fantastic.  Everyone wants the recipe now!  The only changes I made were....no beef bouillon or bacon bits and I added 1 container of Trader Joe's Tomato Juice (can't recall the exact name).  It was spectacular and will definitely make again!

Not the best chili I have ever had, but works great for parties.  Its not too hot and not overly flavorful, so everybody can eat it.  For my own taste, I doubled almost all the seasonings, added an extra 3 peeled and seeded tomatoes, used 3 jalapeno peppers (seeded) and added a bunch of extra hot sauce.

Outstanding......Have tried many chili recipes in my lifetime but never found one that was just right!  This one is it.  I did cut back a little bit on the "hot" ingredients as my partner does not like it too hot..........chili was stupendous and will be my chili recipe from hereon in!!  Thank you for the recipe.

Hubby loved it!  Made a few changes... used ground turkey and turkey italian sausage instead of beef and pork sausage, left out the bacon and added 1 drained can of diced tomatoes and chilis (hot sauce).

I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting cubes chuck roast for the ground chuck.  It is a great chili recipe!  Perfect amount of spiciness which might make it terribly kid-friendly however.  It makes more than twelve servings in my opinion so I halved the recipe for our family.

I LOVE this recipe. I make it all of the time. The only modification that I make is not adding as many beans and I also add a package of McCormick s hot chili spices. It is wonderful and makes a ton!

Easy recipe and really good. Tastes similar to wendys chili. There isnt anything funny tasting like others have stated. Its not your plain jane tomato juice wannabe chili recipe though. it has lots of flavor and is bulked up by a lot of meat. this recipe made about 6 quarts so i half it.

Excellent!  Made this for last year's Halloween party and EVERYONE had seconds and asked for the recipe.  It was a lot of work, so I wouldn't make it all the time, but certainly a nice splurge every once in a while.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

WOW! What a great chili. I changed nothing other than using canned green chilis for fresh because I forgot them at the store and adding the kernels from a fresh ear of corn because I needed to use it. It is the best chili I have ever made. Thank You.

Amazing chili!  Followed another person's suggestio and added chuck roast cut into 1" squares.  Cooked till this was tender - added a great texture to this chili.  Great for a cold day!

As I am currently in a Muslim country, I could not add the bacon into it.  Wonder if that would push this recipe up to 5 stars?  :)

I chose this recipe for my very first attempt at making chili and it was a success! I loved how hot and spicy it was, very flavorful. I was a bit frustrated when this rather large batch wouldn't fit into my large pot when I began, but I split it into two pots and it turned out just fine. I topped my chili with sour cream, french onions, tortilla chip crumbs, and cheddar cheese... delicious! And very hearty. I also made corn muffins to go with it as well. I have so much leftover! But it'll make a good quick meal for the next week and I froze the rest. I definitely look forward to making this again. And even better, you can follow the recipe but also cater it to your own taste. Thanks!

I love this chili!  I've made it several times as written and it is a hit!  The last two times I made it, I used chicken sausage and ground turkey for Weight Watcher's acceptability.  Although I prefer the chili using the recipe as written, the low-fat version is also very good.

Made this awesome recipe tonight. Kicked down the heat by about half and added even more fresh diced tomatoes. One full bottle of darke ale didn't hurt! Try some black beans. Great overall recipe

AMAZING! I have made this many times and i always yield it to 6 people. This last time I accidentally got sweet Italian sausage (but it was even better) and i never use bacon bits and always use Guinness for the beer.

Made this and it tasted great! Bear in mind this is coming from someone who doesn't know an awful lot about chili, just how to eat it.  I cut the recipe in half (6 servings) and still had lots of leftovers, and it was the exact perfect size to fit in my stew pot.  Only difference I made was using spicy italian sausage instead of regular, made it much more savory and just the right amount of spicy.

I followed the recipe exactly but my family did not love this.   Since so many others think it's great, I guess it's just our tastebuds.  We prefer a plain chili without all the extras which, in my opinion, seem to take away from the chili flavor.  I enjoyed reading everyone's comments.

I have made this 2 times now. I have served it to guests both times. The only thing I add is about 2 TBL sour cream to every bowl. Just a scoop on top along with the cheese and the fritos.  This recipe is awesome! A big thank you to the one who posted it!

No tweaking necessary!   I followed the recipe as written, and thoroughly enjoyed the Chili. Was spicy enough for those who like a good kick, without being too much for those who can't stand the heat.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was fabulous.  OUr family of 7 all agreed it was the best chili we've ever tasted.  IT seems like a lot of spices, but they all blend together to get a very unique flavor.  Try to have them all on hand before making.  I used only red peppers (personal preference), and used spicy Italian sausage.  Make sure it is quality sausage, as this enhances the flavor.  I also used fresh basil and oregano.  This is so much more than your average chili!

I made this for a pregnant friend who CRAVED chili. She and my husband both LOVED it, but it was a little bit spicy for my tastes. I will definitely make it again but next time I'll cut back a bit on the chili powder.

I made this for our church Olympic Chili Cookoff.  It was awesome--and I won the gold medal!!!  I used a hot spicy sausage from Sam's Club and followed the recipe as closely as I could.  Great recipe, Mighty Purdue!  We are in Duke Country here, but loved the recipe anyway.

I was definitely skeptical with 26 some ingredients but it was actually pretty good.  At first, after I put all the ingredients in my crock pot, I thought it looked "dry" (not much liquid in there) but after simmering in the crock pot all day, it made plenty of rich "sauce." Also VERY VERY VERY zesty!!!!!  I think next time I might use the same spices, just less of them.  The heat was spot on (just right).  Also next time I might put the bell peppers in the food processor to get them smaller (I liked the flavor of the bell pepper, just not the big chunks).  The combination of beef chuck with italian suasage and bacon bits really put it over the top.

I made this for my churches chili cook off.  I left out some of the more spicier seasonings and it didn't do so well.  The next time I followed the recipe and won first place.  It's not too spicy, but just right.  It tastes even better the next day.  It continues to be a winner each time I make it!

I've never made chili before, but this recipe made me feel like a Top Chef Master!  It is seriously delish.  I 1/2ed the recipe, which still filled my largest pot!  I omitted the cumin and bullion cubes.  I replaced the chile pepper with jalapeno.

This chili is awesome making a second batch today. I usually eyeball the spices and omit the peppers. I am a mild spicy girl. I didnt have beer or beef broth so i used left over sherry cooking wine. And I use the chili style diced tomatos. Put it in the crockpot and let it cook on high for 4 hours. This is the best chili recipe ever especially for frito pie.

Seriously amazing chili!  It took longer than my usual recipe, but it was definitely worth the effort.  I used Italian-style Turkey sausage to cut back on fat, and used amazing Muir-Glen fire-roasted canned tomatoes/tomato paste... I really think they added a depth of flavor.  Of course, I couldn't help but to add a little extra bacon, and used "better than boullion" instead of the gross cubes - but otherwise kept the recipe as written.  DELISH!

Really yummy.  I don't like as much spice, so I halved the chili powder and omitted the cayenne pepper.  Still has a little kick, but not overpowering.  I also omitted the beer and added about 2 cups of frozen corn.

Let me be #1561 to say WOW, this was awesome.  I omitted the beer (didn't have any), and this chili was definitely the best we've ever had.  My husband ate three bowls!  I served it with sour cream, shredded mild cheddar cheese, and cornbread.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!

By far the best Chili I have ever tried!  I didn't like the sausage. And, I tried to make it a little healthier by using ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Since I didn't use the sausage, I used 3 lbs of ground turkey.  I also fried some bacon instead of using the bacon bits.  I also browned the onion, celery and pepper with the meat.  I made this for a Super Bowl party and had zero leftovers.  It's definitely got a kick, but even people that usually complain about the spicy foods I make(I love HOT!), loved this recipe.

we're attending a chili cookoff for cancer this afternoon. this is only my second time to make chili and i must say, this is very tasty at first try. it has all the right elements. i used meat from the fresh market, followed exact recipe and cut three strips of bacon up for the bits. browned the meat and mixed all the ingredients in the stock pot but moved it to the crock pot and cooked it on low overnight....12 hours. hotness rating is mild but can definitely adjust to taste.

This is the best chili recipe HANDS DOWN.  I didnt add the Tabasco sauce, and it was still plenty hot.  I added half the beans for a more meaty chili.  It was the best chili I have ever had. I cant wait to make this again and more beans, peppers and onions.YUMMIE!

Like everyone else says, this chili really does get better with age. I thought it could be a bit more spicy but I love the hot stuff. After trying out several other chili recipes, this is still the best one out there. It makes plenty and always tastes great.

This is one of the Best Chili's I have every had and made!  I was involved a little chili cook off and tried a few recipes but this was the household favorite and ended up being the winning favorite in the cook off!  It is better served the next day - all the flavors really come through!  Highly recommend for chili lovers!

very good recipe, of course I had to dive it my special addition. I added a can of tomato sauce. I also used 2 chipolte peppers and some of the adobo sauce....gave it a little more heat and added a little smokiness. Turned out great....this is a keeper.

Pretty good chili recipe. My husband hates beans, so I had to leave all the beans out.  Threw it in the crock pot for the day, and it turned out good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for an office party & it was the first one gone.  I used others advice and omitted the celery.  Instead of Italian sausage I used Venison sausage.  I increased the amount of bacon bits as some suggested as well.  I used 2 jalepeno peppers instead of the chili peppers as well.  It was just the right amount of spice for me.  Office staff said it had a zing but not too much.

Great recipe!  Does include a lot of ingredients, but most people who cook on a regular basis has those items on hand.  It is a HUGE recipe, so sometimes I cut it in half or share some with a neighbor!  There are a lot of good examples of variations on the reviews; ultimately, we all have different preferences and can customize it any way we want-overall, I was very impressed with this recipe!

Wonderful chili!!!!!!  I received more compliments on this than I have any other chili I have made!  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  Perfect as is!!!!!!!  (Revamped for 2010 Super Bowl with turkey sausage and ground turkey. No one could tell the difference!! This is how we will be making it in our house from now on!)

what fun it is to make chili, esp. when you have such a great recipe as this - I did not follow it to a T - no gr pepper or chilie peppers - used more beer and another can of tomatoe sauce - cut down on cumin - it turned out SENSATIONAL !  I kept the "heat" down a bit for the guests and it was just right !  Got LOTS of compliments ! The combination of the beef chuck with the italian suasage and bacon bits really put it over the top ! Thanks for a great recipe to play with !!!

I've never been a huge fan of chili, but my husband is.  I didn't add all of the spicy ingredients because of the kids but this was sooooo good!!!!  Can't wait until it gets cold again here in Florida.  I will be making this again.

Cooked this twice in one month. My family loves it. I cooked it exactly how it says. Comes out great every time. You can add more or less of something if you'd like but there's no need really. Thanks Purdue!

Ridiculously good, except I substitute the meat for ground turkey and turkey sausage. Cuts the fat in half and doesn't even miss a beat on taste.

This is the best chili I have ever had. It makes a lot and it freezes well. My family and friends loved it. My only substitution since I made it on a Sunday was I used Goya malt beverage, because I had no beer. This is a keeper.

This is the best chili I've ever had!  The addition of sausage seems so obvious I can't believe I haven't heard of it before.  Any time I make chili in the future, it will be this recipe.

This was good - not amazing, but deffinately really good. I halved the recipe and made a few substitutions - couldn't find "chili beans" so I used one can of light kidney beans and one can of dark kidney beans - both rinsed. Also, it was a little too thick so I added an extra small can of diced tomatos

I made this tonight for my girlfriends and they all loved it! It had the right amount of spice and flavor, and I mostly followed all the directions (no oregano, spicy chili beans or green chile peppers). Leftovers will definitely make a great lunch next week!

Excellent Chili recipe! I am a first time chili maker and this recipe made it easy. The chili was even better as it aged over a couple of days. I did cut back on the chili powder, instead of using 1/4 cup, I used 2 1/2 TBS. It was still spicy but the kids could eat it. I served with corn bread. I will make chili with this recipe from now on.

I've looked at this recipe for a long time knowing the recipe I already have is pretty good. (and much less ingredients) Thought this just might be better.  I have to say it was good but for all the extra ingredients it's not exceptional.  Don't get me wrong we enjoyed it so that's the reason for the 5 stars.  I made it just as the recipe reads.

Best ever!  Everyone who has sampled this recipe, has asked for the recipe.  For kids & those not a big fan of spicier foods, we cook noodle or rice and serve the chili on top.

I made this exactly like the recipe called for except I didn't have any ground cumin.  Oh.. I did put in an extra small chili pepper.  The chili looked exact like the picture and everyone loved the taste.  Thanks for sending in this really good chili recipe!!

GREAT recipe. It is just the right amount of spice and flavor. I used half pork, half bison and it was delicious. I made a HUGE pot and we ate it all week.  NEVER got tired of it.

This chili is the best.  It rocks.  Make it just like it says and you will not be disappointed. By far the best chili I've ever eaten.  And it freezes great which is a big plus because it makes a huge pot.

This chili is delicious. I used all beef and omitted the Italian sausage.  I also cut the cayenne and chili pepper to half, but it was still delicious. My family loved everything about it.  The consistency is nice and thick. What else can I say?  It's just darn good!

Thought it was really, really good.  We halved the recipe and used chuck steak instead of ground chuck which made it a great steak chili.  It was perfect for me but a little on the hot side for my wife who has little tolorance for spicy foods.  She added more sour cream to her bowl which cooled it for her.  This is a perminant recipe in our box.

The only thing I changed was to add 1 Tablespoon of cocoa (unsweet, of course), which adds a depth and richness to the broth.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!!

EXCELLENT!  I omitted the beer because I did not have any and added approx 6-ounces of water instead.  I also omitted the jalapenos and it still was AWESOME!

Excellent.  It does take some legwork in the beginning, but it's totally worth it.

I have not made chili in 30 years, if that, and this was really really good. I followed the recipe to the letter except I did saute the onion, peppers and celery in some of the meat grease. Cooked for 3 hours, reheated the next day for another hour or so and it was awesome chili. A little too much heat for my husband, but easily remedied next time. I use Allrecipes all the time and this is the first time I have reviewed. Thanks MIGHTYPURDUE22!!!

I made adjustments to account for Gluten Free necessities and some other adjustments. I used andouille sausage instead of the bulk italian sausage, used 3-4 pieces of cooked crumbled pepper bacon instead of the bacon bits, used GF beer, used 1 teaspoon kitchen bouquet instead of beef bouillon cubes, used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, did not use the green chiles and kept everything else the same.   I'm not one that eats chili on a regular basis and I don't usually like it, however this was AWESOME! Just the right amount of heat/burn without too much.  I was almost wishing I wouldn't like it since it requires alot of prep work, however it is WELL WORTH IT! I did just brown & drain all the meat and put everything together in the crockpot (no real rhyme or reason to the order) to try and make it a little easier.

Made this for the whole extended family the Sunday after Christmas.  They loved it.  Some ate 4 bowls!  I used only two cans of mild chili beans (+ one spicy) instead of three mild.  Also used only one jalapeno.  Still managed a nice kick, but didn't overwhelm those in the family with "wimpy palates".  Make sure to get the original Fritos as your "topper" cause the "Scoops" are a little thick for this purpose.    Overall a huge success, and very fun to cook with/for the family! 5-stars.

Only a few changes... It tastes so much better if you let it sit for a FEW days. I used two cans of red beans, one in sauce and one regular and one can of kidney beans. Four cans was way too many beans. Everything else was definitley on point.

Though I never boasted of making the best chili in the world, my husband and I were always pleased with my recipe.  On a whim, I decided to make the Boilermaker Tailgate Chili and boy, what a difference.  This is, by far, the most delicious chili I've ever tasted.  I substituted the green chilis with a small can of tomatoes with chilis.  I also prepared mine with ground turkey.  I highly recommend this chili recipe.  Try it; you will not be disappointed!

This was a hit at a potluck. Made it night before and reheated in slowcooker.  I used only turkey (ground and italian sausage) and used 4 slices of cooked bacon (crisp and crumbled).  This is now the family chili recipe!!

This is by far my favorite chili recipe: great tasting and easy.  I didn't have all the spices, and my boyfriend doesn't eat meat so I cut out a few ingredients. No beef bullion or beef broth, no oregano, white sugar, worstechire sauce or paprika.  We love spicy foods so I added a teaspoon of jerk seasoning sauce for an extra kick and left the chili on crock pot for 4 hrs.

This chili was SO good - I can't wait to try it again today (I'm sure it will taste even better left over).  The only I changes I made were adding 1 tsp of garlic powder, and a can of crushed pineapple (cuts the spice but leave the flavor, and you never taste and pineapple).  Thanks for this - it is a definate keeper!

A family favorite. I skipped out on the the chile peppers to avoid what was already going to be hot. And I used Mild Italian for the fa replacement for the chile peppers.

Wow!  This is one of the best chili recipes I've ever made.  My old, tried and true recipe is now in the trash.  The only thing that I changed is to up the onion, omit the tobasco and up the acid with the addition of about 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Great recipe!

I absolutely love this chili!!!  The recipe is perfect, and I have had many "this is the best chili ever" comments!!  I love this spicy fullness.  I sometimes add more chopped up vegetables like zuchini.  Also use a combination of pork sausage and ground venison.

Needed a recipe for chili to use at a cook-off/potluck at work, and used this one...didn't have half the seasonings needed, and that made it a bit expensive (My Manager referred to it as the "40 dollar chili") But now that I have all the seasonings, I can make it w/ ease in the future. People loved it, Won second place & the Hubby, who is NOT a chili-person, sweas it is the best he's ever had & was rather sad when I told him it was all gone! I DID substitute Chicken Broth for Beer, and had no Worcestershire sauce or basil on hand...it was still a winning recipe thats goin in my personal recipe box from here on out! EXCELLENT!

The best chili I've ever eaten!!!  Used about four strips bacon - then sauteed all vegetables in grease (crumbled the bacon to add in).  Used 3 cans chili beans in mild sauce (undrained) and that was plenty of beans.  Everything else - follow recipe! The seasoning was perfect!

My husband always hates it when I try a new recipe, he insists that my old tried and true ones are the best.  I felt that my chili recipe was just not what it should be and wanted to try something different .....Well my husband raved about this chili!!!  I will definitely be making this again, the only thing I changed was to add a can of pork and beans to it.  I love this recipe!!!!!!!

After cooking this for 3 days - it's 5 star. The first day - it was ok, kind of thin - 2nd day - tastier and a little thicker - by the third day it is amazing! Thick, hearty and VERY tasty - although I think it could have been a bit spicier. I made it for a Halloween party (I started cooking it 2 days before) and did a little chili buffet - set out some bowls and a platter of sour cream, fresh chives, cheese, and a plate of hotdogs - people could have what they preferred - but no matter what they chose they really enjoyed this chili - and so did I. I left out one can of beans and added a little extra meat and i used real bacon - other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you. :)

I changed it by using 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb hot turkey sausage, 1 lb mild Italian sausage, and used real bacon.  I couldnt find the 1 can of hot chili beans so I just substituted with 1 can of kidney beans.  I also messed up a ton and forgot the beef bouilion, and the spicy green peppers!  But even with all these crazy alterations it somehow still turned out great and everyone still raved about it!

This is by far THE best chili recipe I have ever come across.  So flavorful - I used Chuck Roast for the meat - expensive, but worth it!  This chili is best made in a croc-pot and left to cook on low for 8-10 hrs.  I ALWAYS make this a day or two ahead of time to let the flavors mellow out - THE only chili I will ever be making!  I would rate this a 10 star if I could.

I didn't have the dark beer or the coriander and I too used chili powder instead of sauce. I did add some adobo peppers and it had a nice smoky flavor. I also left out the chilli peppers because I was cooking for little ones. This was a really good chili but not exactly the show stopper I was looking for.

This chili was DELICIOUS!  The first time I made it I won a chili contest with it!  The only change I made was I used real bacon and crumbled it instead of using bacos.

Don't get put off by the list of ingredients. This absolutely is: A crowd pleaser !!  Personally I don't like bell pepper so I leave them out. Also - they tend to get "soggy" when reheating. For the best taste make the night before. Or even 2 days ahead of time. My only real adjustment is to add 4t of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. And the tomato paste doesn't really add too much.

instead of using ground beef and sausage, I used 3 pounds of round roast/ or the cheapest beef that is on sale. i cut the beef into bite size pieces (about a half a inch). Brown the meat on the stove pot then i add all of the other ingredients.I use a whole package of bacon. cooked the bacon until it is crisp then broke it up into pieces.  Also i use 1 1/2 cans of beer. I've used anything from bud lite to rouge dead mans beer. the poppyer the beer the better. I used to cook it on the stove top but now i brown the meet then throw everything into a crock pot. I usually put it in the fridge but i think i might let it cook in the crock pot all night. That way the beef will be extra tender and melt in your mouth and the longer you cook It the more flavor there is.

I made this chili yesterday and know it will be even better today.  I made a half recipe...and even so, had probably 10-12 bowls of chili.  So a whole recipe will feed a CROWD!  I used ground venison instead of chuck, added chipotle powder, a large can of black beans, and adjusted the other seasonings to suit our heat tolerence.  The Italian sausage adds a subtle richness.  I will not use the packaged chili "mix" anymore!!!  I also took a suggestion to serve it with cornbread muffins...never done that before, but it was a GREAT combination!  I think the two go together really well!

This is the best Chili I have ever eaten.  It is a bit work but well worth it.  The only thing I changed was to cut back on the Chili Powder.  It is still quite spicy so if you don't like your chili really spicy make sure you cut back on chili powder ALOT.

I guess we do chili differently in Texas.  This is not something I will ever make again. It was not nearly spicy enough, way too tomato-y, and had too many dang beans. Also, celery in chili? Blasphemy! I'm super bummed.

I chose to make this chili because of all the 5 star reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, I have a weak stomach and this was entirely too spicy for me (I should have known when it called for 1/4 cup of chili powder!). The flavor was good (the reason for a 2 star rather than 1), but the spices are over the top. My husband ate 2 bowls last night and just sent me a text message this morning that he can still taste it. If I were to make this again I would only use maybe a tablespoon of the chili powder and adjust it up if necessary. If you like very spicy things this recipe is probably for you, but if you have acid reflux or get heartburn easily, beware!!

Delicious for sure!  We used chicken broth instead of beer and didn't have the chili peppers but still had quite a kick and great flavor.  It was perfect on a cold Sunday afternoon.

EDITED TO ADD:  I entered this into a chili cook-off in my office today and I came in 1st place against 11 other chilies!!  I've been asked to share this recipe by more than a dozen people!  Thanks for giving me a winning recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly and must say this chili is awesome!!  I started it on Saturday evening, cooked it for several hours, refrigerated over night and then simmered it for several more hours on Sunday afternoon.  At first I was afraid it would be too thick but in the end the consistency was perfect - especially when I added a bit of cheese when serving.  I served it with muffins made from the Basic Corn Muffins recipe on this site.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a very good traditional chili, but I think it could be made better.  Next time I make it, I will use diced sirloin (slightly freeze it first and it dices nicely) and something to make it richer, such as coffee and cocoa powder--possibly more tomato paste.  These additions will probably make it richer, which will then make it worthy of five stars.

I really like the recipe and have made it several times. A few of my modifications: I only use 1 lb of ground meat (It makes so much you really don't need two pounds). Sometimes I'll use ground turkey and turkey sausage to make it a little healthier. There is already so much flavor, it doesn't make a noticeable difference. I add 2 cans of tomato sauce or condensed tomato soup because it is so thick. If I don't have beer around I replace it with water. You can always add more liquid, depending on how thick you like your chili. I also make it the night before and reheat the next day. I wanted to try cooking it in the slow cooker, but it didn't fit! It goes great with Jiffy cornbread on the side.

This recipe makes a great chili that has room for customization. I like to skip the Italian sausage and substitute more beef. I recommend using chuck roast instead of ground beef. I've tried it cubed and browned before adding and I've also tried it with slow cooked chuck roast. I prefer the latter while my wife prefers the former. If you do try it with slow cooked chuck roast, try not to shred it too much or you'll lose all those nice chunks during the simmer.  I also recommend adding additional spiciness if you like it hot. The stock configuration isn't really that spicy and I'm a wimp. I use crushed red pepper to heat mine up. Hope that helps.

I live in Cincinnati, where we dont put beans in our chili. I made this recipie without the beans and it was incredible! I added an extra pound of hamburger (to replace beans) to make sure it was hardy enough. Great reviews from everyone who ate it. Its my new favorite chili. Thanks for the great recipie!

The only change I made was I used chili beans in medium sauce instead of spicy sauce.  Turned out great! It may be a little too spicy for children!

This chili is EXCELLENT. I thought italian sausage in chili sounded bizarre, so I did not use it. However, once all the flavor came together I can see it being excellent. This is a VERY unique chili, very good though.  The changes I made were a bit more onion and pepper. Fresh diced tomato rather than canned. More fresh garlic, used about 6 cloves. Fresh bacon, used a whole package to compensate for not using sausage.  Used alot more seasoning, almost doubled everything, bunch of cayenne pepper too, also a packet of goya sazon.  Used one cup of Heineken rather than a half cup.  And I fried up the veggies using some of the bacon grease.     AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING CHILI!!!  Writing the review now as it's been simmering 90minutes, so has more to go, as is at this moment it's just incredible.  5 stars and then some.

Without any alterations this chili is amazing!  And when they say it's better the next day, it is!  This is a great chili to make at home or bring to parties.  I have officially stopped looking for "the best" chili recipe, because this is it!

Don't waste your time on this mediocre recipe.  I didn't really care for it and it took a lot longer then any chili recipe I've made. I'm not saying it's terrible but I'm not saying it's that great either.

Definitely the best chili I've ever made! The only thing I do different is take out the celery - I'm not a big fan of celery in anything. Otherwise, perfect recipe!

This is a good recipe except for one thing.   Carrol Shelby who was one of the founding fathers of the first and biggest chili cookoff in the world (The Terlingua chili cookoff) said he who puts beans in chili knows beans about chili.  True chili has no bean and very little or no tomatoes in it.  I come from Dallas and also lived in San Antonio where chile got its start in the USA.  Dallas had one of the other founding fathers for Terlingua in it and the Chili queens of San Antonio were cooking chili in Texas before chili was well know in the USA. Nuf Said.

I really liked this a lot.  Added extra hot to suite my taste.  A few extra peppers and just a bit extra chili powder.  Really good the next day.

This was delicious! I made this for my boyfriend and he raved about it. As per the instructions in the review by VORCHA, it turned out wonderfully. My only one comment is that we found it too salty. Do not put any additional salt as the recipe states. Thanks for sharing!

The *absolute best* chili ever!  The longer you simmer the better.  The meat turns into a great consistency - great over fritos, rice, WHATEVER.  Always a great hit for parties!

This was my first time making chili and I was looking for a good recipe. This was relatively easy to make and extremely good. It really does taste better the next day too. My recommendation is to make it the day before, reheat and serve. Excellent.

I left out the celery because I'm not fond of it, and heartachingly left out the bell peppers even though I love them, because my boyfriend doesn't.  I also used a whole can of beer, because I didn't see the point of keeping half a can around... and I hate drinking the stuff so... in it went!  Put in two tablespoons of bacon bits instead of one.  Oh and used sriracha hot sauce instead of the usual tabasco because I'm Asian and it's our go-to hot sauce, hehe.  I know chili tastes best the day after, but I couldn't help trying some out of the crock pot tonight with Ritz crackers... YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Can't wait for tomorrow! =D

Great recipe.  Prepared exactly as written the first 2 times (great) but did some adjustments (better).  Mostly in technique, but some substitutions (minor) in ingredients.  After cooking the meat and setting aside to drain, I sauteed the onions, celery and bell pepper in a little olive oil until half cooked.  Then added dry seasonings (except chili powder) to 'bloom' flavors for a few minutes and then added wet seasonings (ie mix of chicken and beef bouillon cubes already dissolved in 1/3 c. boiling water; beer; Worcestershire sauce; Tabasco).  Added chili powder (New Mexican) with all the canned ingredients.  Used 2 cans of no-salt tomatoes (there's plenty enough salt already) and used 2 cans of chili beans (in sauce) and 1 can drained/rinsed red kidney beans. I thought a total of 4 cans of beans was a bit much; 3 made it a better balance.  I added a large can of mild diced green chilies in addition to the jalapeno pepper.  I've made this with and without bacon (when I didn't have any) and both are good.  I use the pre-cooked bacon easily available these days and throw them in while I'm sauteing the onions.  Am not Jewish, but have found kosher bouillon cubes to be excellent (I'll never go back to the regular ones).  Depending on who will be eating the chili I may cut down on the cayenne a little.  Best served a day or two later and really yummy with Mexican crema (sour cream) also easily found at the supermarket.

This chili recipe turned out really good.  I thought it would turn out extremely spicy... it was hot but soon as you stopped eating the "hot" didn't linger in your mouth.  I made a few changes... added a little more bacon, used beef chuck steak cut into really small pieces (rather than ground), added a can of drained sweet corn, and tweaked the measurements of a few of the spices.  I used a crock pot to cook and it barely fit into it.  As it cooked, it spilled out onto the floor, and I had to remove some of the chili and cook part of it on the stove.  So make sure you have a big crock pot if your going use one.

Really excellent.  My husband, being a Purdue alum, was really intrigued when I told him the name :)  This is the only way we eat beef chili now.  It is so worth the extra effort.  Allow it to simmer for several hours, per instructions.  It really allows the flavors to combine.

This is an amazing recipe!! Well deserving of 5 stars. It's true that the longer it sits the better it gets so keep it on low or simmer for a while. I left the recipe as is as I was making it for people who don't like anything really spicy. For my own taste i had to add a little something to kick it up a little, but it stands very well all on it's own!  Freezes well and keeps well in the fridge. Everyone loved this recipe and I'm getting asked for the recipe!

I have made this recipe many times now and my family absolutely loves it!  Its great for potlucks, parties, or just a cold winter day.  I do exactly as the recipe specifies other than substituting one can of chili beans for a can of kidney beans just because we like kidney beans a lot.  Great recipe and darn near idiot proof.  A little time consuming but well worth the effort!

Last time I made this I added some Chorizo which was very good. This recipe calls for alot of ingredients--true. But this is easy and delicious. It makes a lot, freezes well and is my go-to recipe for chili when I really want to impress. Enjoy!

I have made this Chili quite a few times before and I love it.  I make a few changes to it.  I add some extra onions, put in some mushrooms, and a little more garlic!  Other than that the recipe is perfect!  Oh one other quick note, as the recipe says, the longer you cook it, the better it is!

I made the mistake of using a chili seasoning packet I had on hand in place of "spicy" beans and chili powder. The recipe itself would be a 3 star if I had followed it to the letter. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome...made it for a family function...everyone loved it.  I didnt add the green chili peppers or the tabasco sauce, just the cayenne and chili powder and it was still great...not too spicy.  I also added a can of mushrooms. I absolutely loved it and will be making it again.

I made this chili for my work's Chili Cook Off and I'm currently in the lead with only 3 competitors left.    I made the following changes: 1.5 lbs of ground chuck 1.5 lbs of spicy italian sausage 1 40 oz can of mild beans 2 15 oz cans of spicy beans No celery Minced the green & red pepper to be really fine so it wasn't so chunky. 12 slices of fresh bacon chopped 1 bottle of beer No tabasco because it was too spicy already   I served with Pasta, Fritos, Sour Cream, and Cheddar Cheese.  I offered pureed pineapple to tone it done, but everyone liked the spice.  It was delicious!

Sorry.  The chili was OK but not great. Because of all the "prize winners" from this recipe, I entered it into my company Chili Cook-Off and it wasn't even close.  I am truly disappointed.  Back to finding another great chili recipe.

Super! This makes a lot! I used real bacon and just fried it with the other meats. Also, I added t cans of whole mushrooms and some corn, which is something my mom always added to her chili and I always like the little bit of sweetness and different texture it added. Kudos to the originator of this recipe!

I was really hoping to like this more than I did.  I made it as stated and took it to a super bowl party.  Unfortunately it was not a hit and I ended up taking all but three bowls back home with me.  It's an awful lot of work for a flavor no one was really crazy for.

I made this exactly as written, which is hard for me because I think I make great chili.  I entered this in a chili cook off at my club and came in 2nd Place in the mild category!  I added 5 finely diced habeñeros, and entered it in the spicy category and placed third.  I was the only cook with two awards!!

This was really good chili but not the best ever, I'll definitely make again! Made the following modifications to make it spicier: - Doubled the jalapenos - Used petite diced toms with jalapenos - Used xxhot habanero sauce instead of tabasco - Used hot chili powder - Used tomato sauce by accident - Used all red pepper, no green  - Used regular chili beans (store didnt have hot)

This recipe was such a success for this year's Super Bowl.  I usually like to tweak recipes to my taste but the reviews were so good, I made it as it and LOVED it....Until this recipe, I thought I had the best chili recipe. I accept defeat.  I have been defeated.  Defeat has never tasted so good.

Great recipe! I just made a couple of minor changes: in place of the bulk sausage, I used 1 lb ground pork. For the beans, I used a 28-oz can of red kidney beans, a 28-oz can white kidney beans, and a 28-oz can Romano beans. Made this for the Super Bowl, the day before, along with the Homesteader Cornbread recipe, and they made a great combination. The chili was gone in two days ! Will definitely make again.

I also am entering this recipe into a Chili Competition contest at work. I tried the recipe as is, With a few changes. Since I couldn't find Spicy Chili Beans, Sub'd 2 Chili beans Mexican style, 1 can Med Chili Beans and 1 can Black beans. Make a pot and took it to work for a pilot test test, since this was the first time making it. The reviews were mixed. Some said it was just right (Non spice lovers) others thought it needed Kicked up a notch.  How do you please everyone including the judges. I thought about adding 1/2 tsp Cayenne or adding an extra Jalapeno w/seeds. or even chopping a few smokey chipolti peppers. What would give the best overall heat/flavor without changing the overall flavor?

FAR too rich for me.  My stomach was very upset.  For someone who really likes chili, they will probably enjoy.  I gave it away to my nephews who thought it was OK.

I have tried several chili recipes from Allrecipes and they are all good. But this one is wonderful. I think I followed the recipe exactly except for the cayene - didn't have any, so I substituted chipotle instead. Then I cooked it all day in the crock pot on low. Having lived in Albuquerque for over 20 years, I needed a little more kick, so I added a pile of nacho-style jalapenos to my bowl, since my wife doesn't like them. This is now "my chili". The best I hace ever tasted.

Very good as is or modified.  I omitted sausage and used only 1 can of crushed tomato this time around and it came out great.  Also added a few slices of turkey bacon for flavor and discarded when done cooking through.  I usually simmer this for 3 hours + and add beans for the last hour of cooking.

Very good.  Be sure to let the chili "mulch" overnight as it really improves the flavor.

This is by far the best chili ever.  The only thing I did not add was the celery because I didn't have any.  We are looking forward to having chili dogs tomorrow with the leftover's.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

With a 1000+ excellent reviews, this didn't need another one, but I couldn't resist.  This is an excellent recipe and the only thing I changed was I used no salt canned chopped tomatoes.  This made a lot of chili and the two of us will get at least three dinners and probably one lunch.  My husband couldn't stopped eating it saying "this is the best chili I ever had"!  Don't loose that recipe.  Goes great with a corn bread muffin on the side.

I made this chili for a superbowl party.  Based on the reviews and people saying they won chili cook offs with it, I was expecting a lot of oooohs and aaaaaahs after people at this.  Not one peep from anyone.  I nearly followed the recipe to a T based on ingredients I had available at the store.  They were out of green chile peppers, so I used the diced can kind.  They were out of chili beans, so I used kidney and pinto beans.  Plus I used hot sausage.  Otherwise, everything else was the same.  It tasted good, but it was runnier than I prefer and prep took forever because there are so many ingredients.  I have simpler recipes with much less prep and ingredients I will stick with in the future.  But I still give ths one 4 stars because my husband loved it.

This is the best chili I've ever eaten or made!  I did make a few minor changes.  Instead of Italian sausage, I substituted regular hot pork sausage.  Also substituted 2 cans of Rotel chopped tomatoes with chilis added, then omitted the 2 green chile peppers. I fried 3 pieces of bacon reserving the drippings to saute the onion, bell peppers and celery before adding to the mix, then crumbled the 3 pieces of bacon (substituting for 3 T of bacon bits).  I used Hot Mexican chili powder, a whole can of beer, 1/2 teas. cayenne pepper and an extra teas. of sugar.  I ended up not using the 2 teas. hot pepper sauce because with the chilis, hot sausage, hot chili powder and cayenne, it was VERY spicey (just the way we love it) although hot sauce can be added later.  Definitely THE best chili ever and even better the next day!

I am SO proud of myself for making this and for making it taste good - great flavors!  Makes it look like I know what I am doing!  I used 1 lb lean ground beef, 1 lb ground turkey, 1 lb turkey sausage.  I used an anaheim chile pepper and no celery.  I sauteed the onions in the pan I made the bacon in before adding it to the mix.  I used beef broth instead of beer.  I also used only 2 cans of beans - not the biggest bean fan, and also not enough room in my pot for more!  I will be serving this tonight for dinner and also entering it tomorrow into a chili cook-off.  We'll see how it goes.  My advice - unless you have the time, prep your veggies in advance - chopping and such.  Also measuring your seasonings in advance.  I was going to do all this Friday night as I was prepping other food and just didn't - wish I had.  Plus I wish I had a bigger pot!  UPDATE - I had great response in the chili competition today.  Mine was the only one that was completely eaten, BUT I didn't place in the top three.  Someone said that the ones that won were bland and mine was more flavorful and probably scared people.  It's Ohio, so maybe a bit of kick doesn't appeal to people.

Delicious.  We added a little bit more moisture - another 1/3 cup beer.  We also added a bit of brown sugar - cut the acidity a bit.  Next time might try to add a little dark chocolate to cut the acidity instead.

This is the ultimate "everything" chili! I've made this 20+ times this year alone and I always get a fantastic response. I do make the following adjustments though .... I use only 1 lb of ground beef (2 lbs was too much for me), I use a full cup of beer, and I use 2 cans of chili beans, 2 cans of black beans (rinsed), and 1 or 2 cans of kidney beans.  I cook this on low for 6 to 8 hours. I check & adjust the spices every 2 hours. Note: It's always better after it's "rested" for a while. Enjoy!

I love SPICY foods, however, my husband cannot take the heat.  So I simply cut down on the cumin, hot sauce etc., and he can handle it that way.  I always make a HUGE batch of it in the biggest stock pot they sell at Wal-Mart.  The 1st night we eat the chili as is as a soup.  The 2nd night we eat it with sour cream and shredded cheese on top and use tortilla chips or doritos to scoop it and eat like a taco salad.  I freeze enough for an additional 2 nights of supper and I give some away to his grandparents for one night of supper.  So when I make chili, I go all out and it will feed us for 4 nights total (family of 4) and someone else in the family.  I love this recipe, although I leave some things out altogether according to my liking.  But this recipe is GREAT!  Also, I would like to say, that I use the Rotel Brand of diced tomatoes with green chilis original and mild version and it really helps boost the flavor.

Delicious, I used spicy Italian sausage, and Brother Davids Double Abbot Style Ale for the beer (Which left me some delicious beer to drink while this cooked :))  Made loads, and it kept amazingly, getting tastier every day till it was all gone.

Pretty great recipe. I did make quite a few changes however, but did so due to my family's preferences. I added a large can of kidney beans and omitted the italian sausage. I also did not simmer it that long, mostly because I did not read all the directions before I made it and misjudged the time it would make. However 30 minutes was all it really needed. I dont think it could have tasted any better.

This is super good! I stuck  almost completely to the recipe...except I only used three cans of chili beans instead of four, and by my own mistake I only used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes (I dont like chunks). The chili came out nice and thick. It makes a ton so I was able to freeze a lot for my lunches. Nice and spicy too.

Okay, I'm not a big chili fan, but even I was excited to eat the leftovers, it was soooo good! We'll never make another kind! FYI, this makes A LOT of chili, so you may want to halve the recipe, or maybe freeze some.  We gave half of ours to some friends to take home and we still had plenty of leftovers!  I used one poblano pepper (instead of 2 green) and I omitted the tabasco and it still had a good after-burn, but was mild enough for my 19 month old.

This was a Great recipe that was not overly hot.  We had a large group of friends over that night and they all loved it, in fact they went out that night and all showed back up around midnight for more before they went home! LOL! Thank you for this one, I will definitely be making this again!

I just finished putting this together and I know it is going to be amazing (considering I've already had a cup full)!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the following: 4 cans of Red Kidney Beans and a full bottle of Amstel Light (what we had in the fridge). I also used 3 strips of turkey bacon instead of bacon bits and 3 pounds of ground chuck instead of sausage because we don't eat pork.  AWESOME. I highly recommend this recipe!

Serves 10?? Try 20.  This filled my pot to the very top.  It was absolutely delicious.  I made a couple of changes.  I used regular diced tomatoes, but added a 16 oz. can of tomato sauce.  After simmering for several hours it was still quite watery, so I added 1 cup hot water mixed with 3 tablespoons flour to the chili and it thickened it up nicely.  Will definitely make again.

This is some of the best chili I have ever tasted and made.  It has a very good taste and is a little spicy but in a good way.  The only change that we made was we roasted/smoked 2 poblano chilis and replaced those with the chilis specified in the recipe.  Otherwise, we used the exact spices etc in the recipe.  It was very good and great consistency.  I will definitely use this as my chili recipe.

Because Madison and I don't need enough chili to feed the whole block we cut the serving size down to 5. That was still enough to feed more than five of us watching the football games and still have plenty left over. We did make a few modifications to the recipe. First of all instead of using bacon bits we fried up three strips of bacon and crumbled them. We then sauteed the vegetables in ther drippings before adding them to the chili. Madison doesn't like Bell Peppers very much so we left that out. That being said we prepared it the way the recipe directed us to. After simmering for about three hours the taste was OK. Left in the refridgerator overnight and reheated it had the best flavor and just enough kick. Spicey but not three alarm. We loved it. This will be a favorite at our Superbowl party!

Made this today to eat while watching the Rose Bowl. It was very good and received thumbs up all the way around. I only used a dash of cayenne pepper, omitted the tabasco sauce, and only added 1/4 of the green chile pepper because we don't like it too spicy. Turned out perfectly! This recipe is a keeper!

WOW!  I have been looking for a good chili recipe for a long time, and this isn't just good, it is fantastic (as is, no changes made).  I knew it would make a lot but didn't realize how much.  It was just for my husband and I, and it lasted lunches and a few dinners in different ways, and we never got tired of it.  We had it alone with corn bread, over french fries with cheese (and put leftover cole slaw between the fries and chili in our individual bowls since we didn't know how it would taste, it was actually good), and also made chili dogs.  If anyone has other simple ideas for chili leftovers, I would love to hear, because this chili will be made again soon.

This chili is the BEST chili ever! 
Here are the changes I made:
Sub brown sugar for white(suggestion from other review), no bell peppers (dont like), sub yellow chilis for green(all I could find), I used a whole beer(didnt want to waste it :P), I cooked in crockpot 2 hours on High, 3 hours on low.

I cant wait to make it again! YUMMY!

This chili has just the right amount of kick. Maybe too much if you don't like heat. All of the different ingredients really sets this apart from the run of the mill chili recipe. I have made this for a church potluck and it was all gone at the end of the night.

This is a very tasty recipe, I only used 1/2 of the sausage called for because I was afraid of it tasting like pork, and drained the meat really well to cut the fat. I also upped the spices to appeal to our palates and we were incredibly pleased with the results.

I was a little skeptical about the ingredients in this chili, but was pleasantly surprised with the end results.  We have a christmas tradition of getting together(3 generations) and crafting christmas ornaments.  I made this Chili and my favorite cornbread (yellow cake corn bread) recipe and both were a HUGE HIT!  I didn't have mild green chiles, but medium hot chiles, so I left out the hot sauce figuring everyone could add their own. Other than that I followed this recipe exactly.  You just can't improve on perfection.  The spice was perfact for all.  We served bland canned chili to the toddlers though.  If you haven't tried this you need to and don't change a thing!

So delicious! Don't be put off by the large number of ingredients. This is fantastic, it has the perfect amount of heat, reheats after freezing just as great. I didn't use celery and used an anehiem and a pablano as my two chilis.

I made this for a football get-together and it went over quite well.  I let it simmer for several hours split over two days.  In my opinion, this was not spicy.  Next time I might kick up the heat just a bit.

We LOVED this chili. We did not add the celery or peppers (my husband hates them). The other things we modified is that we used about 2 1/2 lbs of beef - 1 pound of beef, 1 pound of ground turkey and 1 lb of sausage. We only had three cans of kidney beans and this worked out fine. 

We will definitely be making this chili again. It calls for a LOT of ingredients - but it's worth it!

My wife grew up with a father that prided himself on his Chili. He participated in Chili taste testing contests and everything. She always said there was nothing that could beat her father's Chili. After I cooked up this recipe (minus the beer ingredient) and gave her some, she said "Wow! This is really awesome. Don't tell my dad I said that!" Enough said.

I've been making this chili for a few years now, and it's always a hit. I do a couple of things differently. I omit the sugar, bacon bits, celery, and usually the sausage. For beans I use 3 cans of kidney beans rinsed and drained because I've never seen "chili beans" in my grocery store. I've never measured the spices, but definitely am generous with the chili powder and garlic. Couldn't be easier, I do think the beer is super important. I usualky use a good heavy dark beer. I've made this without beer once and it wasn't nearly as good.

I made a double batch. I got rave reviews from EVERYONE. Heated the left overs the next day... Even better. Did only make with about half the spices though and it still had a good "after tingle". Perfect for kids. Did add red kidney beans & black beans as well as chili beans.

I'm confused by this recipe. I made it on tues, reheated it the next day for a chili cook off at work. It was so-so on tues but better on weds. By the time I took it home after the cook off, it was better yet. It has a delayed reaction in spiciness. Starts out mild then builds in intensity. I personally thought this was just an ok to fairly good chili but i don't understand the rave reivews at all. And out of 8 entries, it didn't even place so go figure. I thought it was good but i'm still on the quest for the ultimate chili recipe.

A great recipe!! I made this on thurs and warmed in the crockpot for my camping family, (8 people) and every last bean was gone. They absolutely loved it!! It was the best I ever made. I followed the recipe to the T! A lot of chopping but was worth it. I passed the recipe onto my family. Thanks to all the reviews.

I am so excited about this chili! The first day it was a medium heat and seemed to be mild the next day. I cooked this in a 7 quart slow cooker with no room to spare on high for 4 hours.  I am only cooking for two people, but I made a full batch to freeze the leftovers.  I didn't overly alter the recipe as I usually do based on the amazing reviews.  I did add 1/4 c extra premium light beer, 1 small can chopped green chilies (couldn’t find green chilies in the produce department, but saved work on chopping), and doubled up on the Worcestershire and garlic.  I used an amazing chopper so this recipe was extremely easy for me (I hate to chop).  Other than that, it did not take long at all since you are simply measuring 1t or 1T of several spices (all of which I had on hand) and dumping them, along with canned ingredients, into a pot.

Excellent! I modified to reduce the spiciness for my kids (less hot sauce, chiles etc), replaced one can of chili beans with one can of black beans and it was really, really good! 
I did end up adding some pureed pineaple as someone suggested to further tame it down for my children and it worked great!
This recipe is a definate keeper!

Very good chili. Good base recipe. I added some shredded carrots to sneak in extra veggies, as well as extra celery. My husband really enjoyed the fact that there were 2 meats in the chili and he raved about it. Will make again.

Perfect recipe! I'm pregnant and watching fat and sodium, so I used 2 lbs. ground chicken instead of the other meats. I also used Sodium-free diced tomatoes and rinsed the beans, and I didn't have to add any extra salt other than the 1 tsp that the recipe calls for. I didn't use beer either, and this was just fine without it. I'm sure you can adjust the ingredients to your dietary needs as well, and it will still be delicious!

Wow.  I was a bit surprised at the rating looking at the ingredients and thought I would give it a try.  Whoa!  I'm a chili fanatic and it takes a lot to get me to change, but this did it.  Fantastic chili!

Love it - the only change I make is that I use real bacon instead of bits and I use at least double if not more of the bacon - oh wait there is one more change - I add one less can of chili beans.  Every one always loves this recipe and eats seconds and thirds - excellent with a dollop of S.C. on top and some shredded cheddar.  I am not from Texas and have no idea how the chili tastes there but for my (and all my friends and family) Vermont taste buds its about perfect. Thanks so much for a great chili recipe

I thought this was really good, however I prefer my own chili much more due to similar flavor but much more simplicity.  Very good recipe though.

Excellent recipe and one of our favorites!  The only change I made was to use roasted red bell peppers (the kind you buy in a jar)-- it gives it a little more of a 'spicy' kick and we love it.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Our company just had a chili cook off and since I've never actually "made" chili before, I thought I'd try this one because of all the wonderful reviews.  I made the chili exactly like recipe said and I won 2nd place out of 16 entries.  This is the best chili I have ever had! mmmmmmm!  I guess I won't be making chili out of the packets anymore!

This chili is wonderful! The only thing I would say is that I would add more spice. It isn't bland, but I prefer more of a kick. I will make this again.

Absolutely the bomb chili.
I don't like bell peppers and wanted some heat, I substituted 1 jalapeno for the green pepper, and still did the 2 mild peppers and it was great.
My only complaint was I wish this was from a Wolverine fan.
Thanks for sharing!!

I am not very good at improvising, so I followed this recipe exactly as it was submitted, except that since I was making it for the next day and I didn't want to stay up waiting for the pot to cool, I left it in the crock pot over night (on low).  By the next evening, it was just amazing.  Everyone that tried it LOVED it!  A big hit and well worth the time and extra effort involved.  I will be making it again this week to serve to our little league team with hot dogs.

My family really liked this.  I made 2 mistakes though.  I read the recipe wrong and bought a chuck roast instead of ground chuck.  But my family prefers chunks of beef in chili rather than ground beef anyway. I just cut it in bite sized pieces and browned it as the recipe stated.  The other mistake is I didn't have tomato paste and I didn't use anything in place of it.  I am saving this one, and will make it again.

PERFECT! This is the first time I make chili and I think I chose the best recipe...I used a clay pot (cazuela de barro, in Spanish...not sure what the exact translation would be) and let it cook for two full hours...the flavour was incredible..This is a new favourite in my family.

Excellent! I substituted two of the chili beans cans for black beans and left out the celery.  I would use a little more cayenne pepper next time, but other than that, perfect!

This recipe is Soooo Good!  I made it exactly how the recipe is written (minus the bacon)and it turned out wonderful!  My fiance loves chili, and all of the other chili recipes I've tried have been just mediocre.  He says this is the best chili he has ever had.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow, this is THE chili recipe.  I will never make another chili recipe again.  The only thing I have to change in the future is the spice, but that is only for the kids, for adults the spice is perfect, in fact every single part of this recipe is perfect.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This is the BEST chili ever!  I used turkey Italian sausage to cut down on some fat, and it was fantastic!  I would never have thought to use Italian sausage, but it most definitely takes center stage in flavor.  I also added 2 cans of black beans and tossed in some corn.  I can't wait to make this for a big crowd.  It is too good to eat alone.                                      UPDATE:  I've tried this recipe several times now, and since I don't drink alcohol, I don't always have beer.  I can honestly tell you that this tastes a whole lot better with beer.  I typically use Corona or Dos Equis.  I heard you should only cook with alcohol you would drink, and my buddies recommended those as their top two.  Also, this recipe turns out to be very adaptable.  I added some small dices of zucchini and squash, and it was still super YUMMY!

Good, good stuff.  The only alteration I made was to substitute one can of kidney beans for a can of chili beans, and that was only because I like bean variety in my chili.  This was the perfect thickness (not too soupy/not too thick).  I served it for guests and all were complimentary and had seconds.  My husband liked it so much that he wanted me to enter it in his work's chili competition.

This is  a great recipe...I cut most of the ingredients in half (since it is only me and my husband)...as well I used pinto and kidney beans instead of chili beans. But the combination of all the spices is great!

We served this for Superbowl and it had great flavor!  However, I didn't make it exactly as stated since I left out the celery and put in cremini mushrooms and corn.  Yummy!

This recipe was excellent!!  I will probably not make my "old" chili recipe ever again. I followed this recipe exactly and absolutely loved it. It was a little spicy for my kids, so I will likely cut back on the heat...but otherwise, this chili was excellent.  The amount of ingredients seems overwhelming but you really won't be sorry.

very good chili. hearty, good taste. made exactly as recipe reads. a lot of ingredients and ended up being a bit spendy since i didn't have everything on hand. may make again in the future. this actually tasted much better reheated as the recipe submitter mentions.

This was my first time making chili. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!!We didnt have chile peppers so we used sport peppers, and it turned out awesome! It IS spicey, but its still flavorful, and the spice does NOT ruin your tastebuds, after the last bite, the spice goes away! We will deffinately be making this one again!

It was my Boilermaker duty to try this chili!  Very good-everyone enjoyed.  It reminded me of Wendy's with the celery and peppers.  I didn't notice the bacon too much and would probably leave that out next time.  Even though it is a sin in Indiana not to put spaghetti noodles in your chili, I much prefer this recipe to what I used to make!

Not only is this the best chili I've ever made, it's the best I've ever eaten. Incredible. I used 1 lb. of very small (1/2" or less) beef chunks in place of 1 lb of the ground beef (hubby likes it that way) and I halved the tabasco and cayenne because I'm a wimp. And everyone still thought it had a good kick. Delish!

I made this for a Superbowl gathering. Everyone loved it. I did cut down on the hot ingredients like the cayenne pepper. We're just not ones to eat very spicy hot foods. It was wonderful. I will probably cut the recipe in half if I'm just making for our family of five. The recipe as written made about 6 quarts of chili.

WOW this chili was hot!! I can tolerate spicy food, but something was on fire in this one. It may be because I had no ceyenne pepper and substituted ground red pepper. If you have a stomach lining, and you care to reserve a portion of it, I recommend against the red pepper.  Also, there are way too many ingredients.  I was making this for super bowl and I think it was halftime before I finished chopping and measuring. 
However, once I got my tastebuds back the chili did have a delicious flavor.

Okay - I have never entered a cooking contest, let only win one.  But I did enter a chili contest and took home 1st prize with your recipe.  The only thing I added was options of rice on the bottom, chili on top with guacamole and cheese.  Thanks for the blue ribbon!

Truly great recipe.  I never used a recipe for chili - always considered it an "art" to throw ingredients together at a whim.  I have made this recipe once a week and can't get enough of the left-overs.  It just gets better in the freezer!

used this recipe except cooked it in the slow cooker. Only 1 problem it wouldn't all fit. Didn't discover this until half way through. Good thing the neighbor has a crock pot.

Super recipe.  Have made it numerous times as hubby loves it but I think its a tad too hot, so I divide it in half prior to adding the hot stuff.

Well, this recipe has taken another first place honor in a chili cook-off. I entered it today in a cook-off at work and walked off with a trophy. I have made it several times and my family just loves it. My husband has even made unsolicited postive comments on it.  I follow the recipe exactly except for using only one green chili pepper and chipotle chili powder instead of cayenne.  This suits my family just fine, they don't like anything hotter than medium salsa. It isn't a "break out in a sweat" hot but more of a "sneak up on you" hot. Although the ingredient list is long and the chopping is quite tedious, the end result is worth the effort. Thanks mightypurdue22!!

Fantastic! I followed it to the "T" I made this for 30 people at our SuperBowl party!  GO GIANTS! It was a hit.  I was told by more than one guest 'this is the best chili i've ever had!' The left overs were even better! This is my new chili recipe.....THANK YOU. ~viva, NY

Very good.  Modified it a little to our liking and spiced it up some for our taste. I used crushed tomatoes and eliminated the bacon bits, celery and cumin for different reasons.  It was a keeper.  I try different recipes all the time and will make this one again.

I've never made chili before, but I decided to try this recipe for my BF's superbowl party. He is a Purdue alum, so I braved the recipe despite my general lack of cooking experience. I made a few adjustments which might have led to a couple of problems. I must say that it turned out absolutely DELICIOUS and I gots tons of compliments on it! I just recommend that you stick with the recipe as is, because my adjustments made the final product a little more soupy than I had envisioned and it wasn't spicy in the slightest. First, I used canned green chilies instead of fresh chopped chilis. I also sauteed all the veggies in olive oil prior to tossing them in the stockpot. I followed the rest of the spices to the exact measurement, but I didn't detect any heat at the end. I also used a full dark beer instead of a half cup. Hence the soupiness, I'm sure, but it definitely added some nice flavor. I cooked it all evening the night before, refrigerated it overnight, and then reheated it on the stovetop. The flavors were very nice, I'd almost put it in a restaurant-quality category. The partygoers layered frito chips on the bottom of a bowl and ladled the chili over, followed by a small amount of sour cream and lots of sharp cheddar. Everyone enjoyed it and my BF took the leftovers to work so everyone could devour it the next day. It's definitely a keeper!

This is a great chili!  I left out all the spicy things, since I can't handle anything remotely hot, but it still tasted fantastic.  It's a HUGE recipe, so we had leftovers for a week.

This chili was was not worth all the ingredients and effort. Way to salty and a little on the spicy side. But that can always be modified.  But for all the effort and ingredients that went into it, can make another chili that is easier and taste just as good, if not better.

I thought this chili was very good but a tad salty.  I followed the recipe except I used "better than bouillon" instead of cubes because it has less salt.  But it was still kind of salty.  Will make again.

I have tried for years to make a good chili.  This recipe did NOT disappoint.  I substitued turkey for the beef and it still turned out fabulous.  A little too spicy, so the second time I made it, I left out the chili peppers...
AWESOME RECIPE!  Great for the Superbowl.

Great recipe and flavor. Will definately make again. It was a little bit too salty so I think I will try to add no added salt products where i can next time and add the salt as needed. I also used a whole bottle of beer for more juice. Family loved it

I usually do not care for chili but I loved this recipe and so did my chili-loving husband!  The only thing I did a little differently was use 1 pound ground beef, 1 pound mild italian sausage, and 1 pound hot italian sausage.  DELICIOUS!  I will be making this again!

The best Chili ever eaten. Made it for Super Bowl Sunday for me and my son. He loved it. It was loaded with flavor and not to spicy. Just right.

I entered this chili in a chili-cookoff fundraiser, and it came in first place out of 13 chilis.  I made it as written and it seemed a little hot the night I made it but it mellowed overnight.  People told me they felt it had a "good" amount of heat with a lot of flavour.  I'll definitely be making it again.

I've now tried three different chili recipes and this one is the strongest. I marked it down, though, for the sausage. Its taste was not particularly well-suited for this dish

Very good but time consuming.  I started this the day before and simmered for 3 hours then continued on game day for another 3-4 hours before we ate.  Beware if you make this for kids it is SPICY. Also, we doubled the bacon because we didn't feel the amount called for would make a difference in the big pot.  We couldn't tell the difference and are unsure if it is necessary.  I realize others feel the bacon is crucial but for us not so much.

It's tough for an Indiana Hoosier fan to give a Purdue Boilermaker a 5 star rating, but THIS RECIPE IS GREAT!  I served it for the Super Bowl, and some people had 4 bowls.  Modify it if you like, but it's pretty darned perfect as is.

Y-U-M-M-Y!!!!
My husband is not a huge chili fan.....until now! This chili is fantastic. I have been searching for a good recipe,and I am so glad I came upon this one. It has a great kick which we love(my kids not so much). That can be altered however.  I only had ground beef-no sausage,but the flavor and taste were wonderful! It is definitely worth a try.

Delicious!!! I used only ground beef and used a can of jalepeno's drained because my grocery store was all out of the fresh ones and I thought it was perfect. I didn't change anything else. Very delish and not too much heat, just enough!

Took 1st place in our chili cookoff yesterday, with rave reviews.  Made way more than 10 servings as described, though, not a problem.  Although it does appear that there are a lot of ingredients, it's still quite easy to make.  Will definitely make again!

I just won 2nd out of 28 entries in our church's Superbowl party chili cook-off.  I  followed the recipe except for the changes as follows:  3 lb. ground chuck, 2 cans spicy chili beans, cooked & crumbled 2 pieces of bacon for the bits, 1/2 bottle of Sam Adams brown ale, and I used fresh basil (1 tbsp) I had put up in the freezer from my garden last summer.  I simmered it for approx. 4 hours on the stove, refrigerated it overnight, then poured it into a crock pot where I cooked it on low from 9 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. - when I had to get it to the church for the contest.  It has the right kick to it coming out of the pot, and individuals can easily spice it up with Tabasco, if desired.

I made this for our Super Bowl party tonight and everyone LOVED it! There was none left. I omitted the meat and made it vegetarian and added some fake ground round. I also split up the chili beans with half chili beans and half black beans. I will be making this chili again

Wow, this makes a ton!  It was a little too meaty for me, even with 2 extra cans of beans, but my husband (a boilermaker) loved it and i have had several recipe requests.  We froze part of it and reheated it for chili dogs and chili dip, which turned out great.

Wonderful chili. First off I am not a chili fan but even I liekd it. I made it for the Big Game today and have never made homemade chili. Everyone  loved it. I used real bacon not bits, I used regular ground beef and I doubled the sugar. Turned out real good!

Is there something above a 5 star??!!! I was wondering if all the prep work was worth it ... ABSOLUTELY!! Only change ... I didn't have garlic and I forgot to take the seeds out of the jalapeno peppers ... still very good. The Husker and Oregon State fans of this household love this chili!!! Thanks!!!

I found this recipe here last winter and started making it. My family really likes it. We don't love canned tomatoes, so I used the petite diced ones.  I also serve with sour cream, corn chips and cheese. I think this is better the second day.

This is the only chili I will make any more. Of course, it's very forgiving if there's something I don't have on hand. But I really prefer it according to the recipe. Family loves it. I do spice up quite a bit with extra jalapenos. Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!

I usually make a very simple chili with beans, meat and chili powder--- boy did this blow my husband away! I will use this as my standard from now on. I didn't have bell peppers or chilis but used diced tomatoes for chili.

I made this for New Years day, I was afraid it would be too spicy so I cut out the cayenne pepper and only used one jalepeno...I should have left it alone, as I did not notice any "kick" at all. I did make this the night before and reheated in the crock pot the next day. Overall very good, the kids enjoyed helping with all the chopping!!

This was very good.  I made a few tweaks to it and entered it into a cooking contest and won third place!  Word of caution though: I have a 5 qt slow cooker, and all of the ingredients fit in the pot ... I let the chili cook overnight, and when we woke up, the juices had boiled out of the pot and were all over the counter AND the floor.  So, make sure you have a bigger crockpot, or cook it in two separates batches!

While being very good, I have a simpler recipe that I usually use, and in the end I think the recipes are about equal.  So complicated doesn't always mean better!

Very good!! My family loved it.  We did leave out the spicy ingredients because of my little ones.  Even without the peppers it has a little kick but no complaints, they gobbled it.  We usually get sick of the chili before it's all gone but this disappeared in 2 days.  Will replace my original recipe with this one.  Thanks for sharing :-)

This was a bit time consuming.  I am not quite used to all the prep work in cooking.  I had a really good review from my guest.  My sister's boyfriend even said it topped hers!!!  Try the recipe... it's worth the work.

I made this for a Chili Cook Off at work today & won first place & $50. I did make a few changes mostly due to it originally tasting hotter than I thought I wanted it.  I will say to get your spices from a spice store rather than the grocery store. They really made the dish!
I deleted the green chiles (forgot to add) I  added 
one 15 oz can of dark red kidney beans-drained, 
an extra one tsp of Paprika,  
one tsp of ground chipolte peppers, 
an extra 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes-not drained,
 2 tsp Hershey's 100% cocoa powder, 
1/4 cup pineapple juice, 
1 tbsp extra sugar, &
 1/2 cup or so of leftover shredded beef roast. I made the night before. 
It's very thick initially but cooks down much thinner & then thickens again nicely by next day. I also used 4 slices of real bacon baked to a crisp in the oven that I crumbled up instead of bacon bits. The flavor mellowed a lot over night & was spicy but not really what I would call too hot. I usually do not eat things that are too spicy & would call this a medium heat flavor. The flavors exploded in your mouth. It is a nice thick chili, not runny at all. I just put in crock pot this am on low for a few hours. Well worth the effort!

Good chili. I did deviate from the recipe a bit due to things I did not have on hand. I cut the recipe in half. Still a full stock pot! I can't imagine it only being 5 servings. I used 1/4 cup of water instead of beer. We don't drink, so I did not have that on hand. I added 5 serrano peppers(we like it spicey) (deseeded). I don't like Italian sauage and couldn't find a place for it in chili, but I did have Jimmy Deans spicy breakfast sausage and used that instead. I used one chipotle boullian cube and one beef bouillian. I did not use bacon bits (coulnd't see the point as another user also stated). Turned out very tastey. I wouldn't say it's the "best" chili, but it's pretty good.

I am a true chili traditionalist: cubed beef or game and no beans.  I made this recipe for my sisters and fiance, all of whom insisted on ground beef and beans in their chili.  This turned out way better than my own, possibly due to the sausage and bacon(added a definite smoky flavor).  The only changes I made were 2 TBL of bacon instead of one and a full cup of dark beer instead of a half-cup. My fiance even said the chili was better than his mom's!

Yummy!! This chili is awesome! I made this for our New Year's Eve party and everyone was commenting on how good it was... at 3:00am we were digging in for seconds :) Followed the recipe to a "T", no changes were made. I will definitely make this one again, thanks!

YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!  That is all that I can say!  Everyone loved it and my boyfriend and brother ask for it every weekend!  The only thing that I changed was that I used diced tomatoes with green chiles in them just because it was easier.  Everything else I followed as written!  Served over Fritos, sour cream, and cheddar cheese....AWESOME!!!

Great chili! Taste even better when you make it in the crock pot! I cut out some of the "spicyness" because my kids can't handle the heat.

This chili is awesome!!  I omitted the bacon bits and sausage due to cholesterol, but it still had a great kick.  I thought it was quite spicy while my husband thought it was perfect (we're both from New Orleans).  It was the first 5 my husband gave me so this will definitely be a keeper!!

I made this for a party and my husband couldn't stop eating it. He kept raving how great it was. I was afraid there wouldn't be anymore left for the guest. I did make some changes to the original recipe and followed the advice of fellow reviewers. It looked fabulous and so delicious! Will make again and again.

This recipe earned every single one of its stars! I omitted the red and green bell peppers and used Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles and lime for the tomatoes. I added chopped green chiles in a can for the chiles mentioned in the recipe. The chili was by far the best I've ever had.  Absolutely delicious and even better the next day.

Best chili I have ever eaten/made.  For the people that complained about the heat and heaviness, my suggestion would be use turkey sausage and if you don't care for spicy things, cut back on the peppers/powders.  I followed this to the "T" and loved it.  Lots of layered flavor.  Thanks so much for an excellent recipe!!

I made this the other night as I couldnt think what to make for dinner. I followed the recipe up to the point where I used A bottle of sieved tomatoes in place of one of the tins purely because my tin opener broke and I couldnt get into another one. I thought this was going to be hotter than it was and Im glad it was perfect. It fed 4 (in large portions) served with rice and was able to freeze the same ammount for another day.  A great tasty recipe and definately a keeper.

This chili was very tasty, but entirely too spicy for me. I even ommited the tobasco, and used only one chili pepper and still too spicy. Will make it without chili peppers and maybe either the cayenne or spicy beans next time. Other than the spiciness, very good chili!

This was absolutely delicious!  So easy to make and such a big hit with my family!  Way more than 10 serving but still gone the next day.  I used a whole can of beer, and omitted the chili peppers, still amazing.  Everyone's dying to know the recipe, but I'm not telling...

Awesome Chili!  I hosted a chili cookoff at my house and ended up winning it!  I followed the recipe except for the can of chili beans in spicy sauce (I couldn't find it at the store).  After I browned the meat, I put everything in a slow cooker and cooked it for nearly two days!  Good Stuff!

this was a GREAT recipe for chili! I used all organic vegetables and pretty much went by the recipe and it turned out great! I even added a little miller chill for the beer and it gave it a unique taste! I even won 1st place in the chili contest at work! the only bummer about that is I went home with NO leftovers!! They loved it! Thanks!

I thought it was awesome. I did only add one hot pepper and it still has a kick.  I would omit the bacon bits as I could not taste them and not worth the extra expense.  My daughter thought it was the best ever!

This is such a great recipe!  It's got a great spice, but not too spicy.  I made it for a church function and was told it tasted like "restaurant chili".  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a BIG hit with my family. I pretty much follow it exactly, depending on what kind of peppers I have in the house. My mother-in-law, who is a wonderful cook, raved and asked for the recipe.

This chili is the best recipe I have ever made.  I didn't put in the peppers (green, red, or chile) but it tasted great anyway, and with a 1/4 of chili seasoning, who needs extra peppers?  Yum!

I think this it the best chili I have ever tasted. I only made a couple changes: I added mushrooms, omitted celery, omitted bacon bits, and omitted the green chili peppers. Everything else I kept the same. I cooked it in a crock pot.

This is one of the best chili recipes I have ever had.  I left out the onions and peppers due to taste preference but added everything else.  I put it in my crock pot on low for 6 hours and then kept it on warm throughout the rest of our party.  Everyone complimented it.

This chili was great.  I did have to add a can of crushed pinapple with the juice to cut the chili powder.  But that was no problem I will just cut back on it next time for the faint of heart.  This is five star chili.

Tried this as a change from our family recipe. Very good flavor. I will make this again for variety. (Or for the yearly chili cook-off at work!) I will leave out some of the hotness and let people put their own in instead.

This chili says "Gitty-up"!!!  We make it about every other week.  I have to confess, I have cut out some of the hot stuff so my kids can eat it, but WOW, it packs the flavor in this hard to beat hearty bowl of Chili.  Great job.

This chili is better than my own chili recipe, I mean it is awesome. I made it "almost" as directed, except I did not have cayenne pepper, and I left out a bit of the spicy stuff, it was still spicy, but not too overpowering. I took it to our saturday poker game and everyone loved it, even people who won't eat spicy could not get enough of it. Thanks for a keeper.

This chili was awesome!  Instead of just chili beans I added black beans, dark kidney beans, light kidney beans and chili beans.  I freehanded the spices, added fresh habenero peppers, and red chilis instead of green.  This was a great recipe.

Loved this recipe!! Opted to add one extra lb of beef, another 1/4 lb or sausage. Cut back on the beans, only used 2 reg cans, and half the chili powder (had some people who can't handle too spicy). Had six very different palates, they all loved it, still had a kick even tamed down. Easy to adjust, and well worth the long list of ingredients.

This is a good chili.  My husband who's picky about his chili liked it.  But I found it wayyyyyyyyy to spicy for my taste eventhough I made I only used medium chili beans instead of spicy, jalapeno peppers instead of chili ones, and less than 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  If I make it again, I probably will just mild chili beans, maybe 1 jalapeno and no cayenne pepper.  I'm only rating this recipe 4 start because 1) there's too many ingredients thus requiring more time for chopping (I prefer simpler recipes) and 2) I really didn't like having to stay close to my stove the whole 2 hours it was simmering to stir it.  If I didn't stir it 5-8 minutes, the bottom would burn and stick to the pan.  I think this recipe can be very good in the crockpot.

Ok this is awesome chili.  I got rave reviews from all who tried it.  I have to admit it is pretty labor-intensive for chili.  This is a special occasion kind of a thing for me but probably the best out there.

Best chili recipe that I've tried yet, and I've tried quite a few!  The only thing I left out was the cayenne pepper because we don't like the taste of it.  Instead, we added a few fresh serrano peppers to replace the heat - tasted fantastic!  Thanks for sharing!

I never used to like chili until I tried this recipe!  Great!  I changed it up slightly by using 1 jalepeno pepper instead of the green chilis.  To balance out the heat, I eliminated the hot sauce.  I topped it off with cheddar jack cheese and sour cream...yum!  This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe!  I add some corn, but that's just my personal preference.  Recipe is perfect as is!  This freezes really well, and tastes even better later on.

This was delicious!!!  My daughter is 11 and doesn't like beans, so I omited them and the spicy peppers, other than that followed it by the book.  Will definitely make it again, my whole family loved it!!

Best Chili recipe ever! The only changes i made was: i used Anaheim peppers instead of chili peppers. I went everywhere and couldn't get my hands on any. I also used more hot sauce. We like it HOT! And i just eye balled all the spices. You really can't go to wrong there unless you use the whole bottle. Thanks for sharing. I will be making again soon.

Made this for my dh b-day dinner...didn't put in the tobasco, but followed recipe exactly otherwise...It was smokin' hot!  Glad I had sour cream in the house to cool it a bit.  The kids didn't eat it as it was too hot, so next time I think I will tone it down.  All the grown up taste buds enjoyed it though...made the night before and reheated it in the crock pot to serve...Yum

I made this for a potluck and got a couple recipe requests, and great reviews.  I omitted the celery, bell peppers, chili peppers and bacon bits.  I added grated carrots, because I just had them on hand.  I browned the meats and threw it all into a Crock Pot for 6 hours.  Easy!

This is awesome chili! Some in my family don't like to see the chunks of veggies, so I put the onion, celery and all the peppers in my food processor, then mixed with the browned beef. Same great taste, no evidence of the veggies!

I made this for my son's birthday party, and it was a HUGE HIT! I made it milder than the recipe called for because of personal preference, but several guests said they would definitely make it hotter. I highly recommend this recipe. It is my new stand-by.

Great recipe!  I omitted the celery, used 4 cans of chili beans in medium sauce. I used a can of hot diced chili peppers.  It had a nice kick but not too spicy. This will be the only chili I make from now on.

Kudos from a Pitt Panther fan!  I prepared this recipe yesterday and wow!  It really was the best chili that I've ever prepared.  I'm from the Mid-west originally and have always had a soft spot for the Boilermakers, but who knew that their fans were enjoying such fabulous fair in the parking lot?  Thanks for a terrific recipe, it's a keeper!

Great recipe! My boyfriend and I don't really like super spicy chili, so we only put half a chili pepper and no Tabasco sauce. We omitted the beer for beef broth and some extra tomato sauce and fresh diced tomatoes and used a red onion as well as 1/2 tbsp of Chipotle Chili Pepper ; I didn't put any salt since it was already pretty salty with the broth. I let it simmer for 8 hours and we both loved it! I don't usually like chili and this was my first time making it, turned out great!!

The kind of chili you think of when you hear the word "chili".  Pretty spicy, but I may have put in a little extra here and there on the chili powder, cayene and hot sauce.

WOW!!! What a great recipe!!! My boyfriend and I loved it.  I added a little extra beer because mine was a bit thick.  This recipe was perfect.  I made it on Wednesday night and we ate it on Thursday and it was the best chili I have ever had.

This was FABULOUS!! I made a few changes due to my groceries...but I tried to stick with the original recipe. I didn't have celery so I used celery salt. No basil, or chilis...so I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. There was just the right amount of heat and so much flavor!! My husband was a little taken aback by the red & green peppers and sausage...(I took the sausage out of the casings and browned it with the gr. meat). We both agreed that this will be the only way we eat chili from now on. What an awesome recipe!!

Fantastic recipe.  I left out the worschestire sauce and used regular kidney beans, cut the chili powder in half and used half the caynne pepper too.  It had spice but didn't burn.  I will definately make this recipe from now on!

This chili ROCKS!!! I was afraid it would be TOO hot, but it's not. Very Robust flavor, and the spicy aroma just lingers for minutes. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow. I deviated based on items on hand. I'm a bean guy, LOVE 'EM, Replaced 2 cans of chili beans with 1 can GREAT NORTHERN BEANS and 1 can of BLACK BEANS, Chiles were not available, substituted with 2 SORRANOs, 1 HOT FINGER, and 1/2 HABANERO, and used FRANKS extra hot sauce...also added 12oz of white mushrooms cut about 3/8"-1/2" thick. If you like mushrooms, they absolutely rock in chili. This recipe is 5 stars for a reason, it absolutely kills! Make it, and impress the hell out of your friends. The spicyness lingers, it's not a scorcher. This is a recipe for the ages. Nuff said.

I LOVE this recipe! When I first decided to make it, I thought it looked like a lot of prep work and wasn't looking forward to spending so much time making Chili. When my family and I ate it, we fell in love! There is no other way that we will eat chili now. Nothing can be added to this that would make it any better. We aren't much for sausage so that's the only thing we leave out. I also cut back on the "HOT" spices for my kids sake, but man......this is truly AWSOME !

How someone can find fault with this recipe, I don't know...I thought it was fantastic. I browned the beef and then added it with all the other ingredients to the slowcooker,with a setting of 3 hours. IT was really very good. Thanx.

Ok, so I have been 'perfecting' my own chili recipe for a few years now and decided to try something different for a change. This chili makes my recipe taste like the dog's breakfast! Wow! I added a can of beef broth instead of the cubes and left out the beer and worchestershire sauce because I didn't have any, but it still tastes incredible! I am following the poster's suggestion of cooking it a day ahead. Monday Night Football can't come fast enough! You have to try this!

I used this recipe for my base, and then adjusted the amounts of everything to fit my taste. I then let it sit over night in a slow cooker. This was also a winner at my company chili cook off. Excellent!

A very good chili.  Nothing unusual about it, but for a basic chili recipe, it has excellent flavor...everything is great -  the colors, the texture, and just the right amount of heat!  We took it to a cook-off, and although we didn't win (we came in 4th), lots of people were asking about (and the crowd we served it to apparently didn't care for spicy chili because the winner's was more of the sweet chili variety). We loved it and will definitely make again.  Made a big pot, but still was one of the first ones gone!  Five stars all the way.

I loved the chili but my husband took one bite and said it set his mouth on fire... To me it wasnt' that hot but if you have sensitive taste this might be too hot for you, if not you'll probably love it.

This is the best chili recipe ever.

Instead of ground beef I buy a beef roast and cut into 1 inch cubes.

I also use some different peppers than just jalapeno.

Really good. I did not have beer so put more bouillon in instead. Used tomatoes with jalapeno. I halved the recipe and it just fit in the standard size crock pot. Super yummy!

You just can't beat this recipe. I used all the recommended spices and veggies except the tabasco and green chilis, using ground turkey and some stew meat I had on hand, and added it all to a pot of fresh pinto beans I had just begun cooking, AWESOME!!! I cooked it for a total of 4 hours and it was worth the wait.

I made this in my Slow Cooker. I didn't add the beer or bacon bits and reduced the amount of chili. Also I more than halved the recipe or it wouldn't have fitted into my cooker. I didn't really like the Chili too much on it's own but when paired with the cheese, corn chips & a dollop of sour cream it was yummy.

I've never had a chili I liked better - the combination of tastes is great.  It takes a while to prep (LOTS of chopping), but it's more than worth it.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Really Good.  The sausage was a nice addition.  It didn't wow us though.  It was just really good.  I'll make it again.  It was a lot of prep work though.

Thank you so much for this wonderful chili recipe! It is the best that I have ever tasted and it won first prize at my work's chili cook-off contest! I love spicy food and this is just the right type of spicy without going overboard since anyone can add all kind of spicy spices and peppers and make it spicy. This recipe took it to the next level by adding some wonderful combination of spices and thick and meaty taste. The ingredient list may scare you at first considering how long it is, but most of the stuff are right in my kitchen cupboard (unless you really don't cook much). When you taste this chili, your mouth will taste the meat and the veggies first and then there is an after effect of spicy goodness, and no, there won't be any grainy spices that lingers in your most like most chili.

perfect spice for everyone. served for a large group and everyone loved it.  i actually forgot the beef bullion, but it turned out great anyway.  The cheese really compliments this chili well (usually i don't care if it has cheese or not)-i used a shredded mexican blend. i was questioning the taste when i started making it, but let it cook for a while- i left it in a crockpot all day, and by the time we all got home it was excellent! definatly a keeper!!!

Tasty, but I wish I had the guts to use all the spices in the recipe.  Got a little scared off by some of the reviews so I backed off on the space.  Therefore, it was a little bland.  Will make it again but will use as exactly written!

Very good!!  Since there is only two of us, I canned the leftovers.  I processed 4 quarts for 90 minutes at 10 pounds.  Pints are 75 minutes at 10 pounds.  Yesterday we had one of the canned quarts.  We eat chili with out noodles, and we eat chili with noodles.  Yesterday I added a little water to liquify it a bit and added noodles.  Excellent both ways.

This was definitely a good chili if you like it hot.  I even cut back on the jalapeno pepper and the hot sauce and it was still too spicy for me.  However, the fellas (my husband and his buds) loved it.

Made this for the SuperBowl.  I've never made a chili with so many ingredients before, but it came out spicy and delicious. I replaced the chile peppers with one serano peopper and added hot Italian sausage instead of the mild.It makes a HUGE batch.  I just put it in the slow cooker to simmer away.  I froze the leftovers in Glad containers for another night.

I cut out a few of the spicier ingredients and the beer, added some macaroni, and really enjoyed this chilli.  It was quite thick and very flavorful.  My boyfriend and a friend of mine ate dinner with me and we all enjoyed it.  My boyfriend and I continued to eat on this chilli for several days afterward.

Fantastic.  I halved the chili powder and omitted the Tabasco so it wasn't very spicy -- which was good for me and the kids.  I made this for the Superbowl and everyone went back for seconds.  We got a lot more than 10 servings out of the recipe too :)  Thanks!

Made this for our superbowl party and it went over very well. Did not deviate from recipe but might have used too much tobasco but everyone enjoyed.

I wa really disappointed in this recipe, considering the great reviews. Ifound it to have way too much tomatoe in it. It overpowered all the other flavors.

Excellent chili.  I used one chili pepper to start, no hot sauce or spicy beans.  Also used 1 can beer.  I adjusted the heat after a couple hours of simmering.  Also went with 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 hot sausage.

My wife and I made this recipe and absolutely loved it. I used Hot Italian sausage which made it a little too spicy for my wife, but she still loved it. I thought it was one of the best chili's I have tried.

Thank you for the best Chili Recipe. I have been making chili for years, I would doctor up a dry mix, good, but this was the best chili I have ever made. I did a few small changes, I used half of the chili pepper, and left out the tabsco and cayenne (for the not hot eaters in my group, I needed cayenne on mine:). I thickened it up a bit with corn flour and water mixture (gives it such a authentic taste). Other than that, I would not change a thing! Glad I made a double batch. I always freeze the leftovers. The only other thing that would have made this better was having Da Bears win the Superbowl!

This was really good chili. We did use a whole bottle of corona and cut back on the amount of beans. i also cut back on the peppers, as my 4 yo can't handle to much spice for her tummy.

I haven't made Chili since the kids left home, so I decided to treat myself. I followed the recipe except for sausage and cumin, and it was wonderful! Because it made so much I've been eating it for days and it gets better each time. Thanks

Great chili! Received rave reviews from friends. Sausage was a nice addition.  We used one can of chick peas instead of one of the cans of kidney beans.  Worked out well. Definitely make again.

Definitely a keeper!  I omitted the fresh green chile peppers and used half of the cayenne pepper, and it still had a nice kick.  I doubled the recipe for a Super Bowl party, and between browning all of the meat,chopping all the veggies, and opening all the cans of beans and tomatoes, this recipe took 2 hours to prepare!  However, it was worth every minute when the chili got rave reviews by everyone at the party.  I've always wanted a good chili recipe, and now I have a GREAT one!  Would definitely go through the trouble to make again (the "make the day before" option is the saving grace!)

This recipe was outstanding!  All the spices and ingredients really added depth to the flavor.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, that ate my chili at the superbowl commented how great it was.  I consider myself pretty sensitive to spicey food and I made this with no alterations to the recipe.  It was the perfect amount of hotness. I will definitely make this again.

I made this chili for after a penguin plunge.  It was a tremendous hit!  I browned the meat and then made it in the crock pot so it would be ready when we returned home.  I did not use sausage in mine, I just used more hamburger.

I've made this chili three times and it kicks butt!!! Everyone who tries it like it. I use 4 or 5 serrano chilis to kick up the heat factor i also added crushed red pepper. I cooked the chuck and sausage in a skillet and added it to a crock pot instead of cooking on the stove.

I served this at my superbowl party.  Everyone really enjoyed it. It is spicy but yet not too spicy for weaker tounges.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 poblano pepper (seeded and membrane removed) in place of the chili peppers.  I brought the left-overs to work today and all who ate it raved and raved.  Yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was fantastic! I used ground turkey and hot turkey sausage, also leaving out the bacon. It made no difference as this was the best chili I have ever made.  It was very easy and I prefer to make my chili in a slow cooker which worked out fine.  I just browned and drained my meat first, then added it in the slowcooker with the beans and diced tomatos.  Excellent recipe!

The best chili ever!!! I did make a few changes because of personal preference, but it was fantastic! I used jarred jalapenos instead of fresh, tomato sauce instead of paste, and 1/2 can of beef broth instead of bouillion. I get cravings for this chili all the time. And the Fritos - a surprisingly delicious touch.

This was great. This recipe has all of the important flavor enhancers. I did not follow it exactly. However, it came out great. I think if you use most of the ingredients from the beef bouillon through the sugar, you can get creative with the vegies, beans and meats. This was very quick to assemble and pop in the slow cooker. I came home from a long meeting to a great smelling house and a big bowl of full flavored chili. Thanks!

Trying the recipe now for the Superbowl! Smeels great and can't wait to taste it. 
Had most of the spices on hand, but had to substitute the italian sausage with WOLVERINE meat. GO BLUE!!

I made this recipe for a football game party and I have to say it was really good.  However, it was a little too spicy for my taste (and I even left out the Tabasco sauce).  Next time I'll make it with less ceyenne pepper.

One of the best chili's i have ever had. Very good flavor, nice and spicy, and as it cooked, filled the house with a wonderful smell. It is also very visually appealing, it looks like what chili should!

This was good, but I too would have liked the chili to be a bit more rich considering all the hype.  I thought the spiciness was a good level, although I do like spicy food.

This was a good chili but honestly I didn't notice a huge difference from other recipes I've tried.  I thought with all the extra ingredients it would taste different but it didn't.  I was disappointed that you couldn't really taste the sausage in it. I followed the directions to a tee!  I will probably keep it around, because like I said, it's good.  Just nothing different, if that makes sense.  I could spend less for the same thing :)

This was given rave reviews by family and friends.  I will make this again.  There are ways to cut down on time (like making it before and freezing it).  YUMMY!

This was great!!  I altered it slightly.  I omitted the peppers and Tobasco.  I like the spicy, but hubby doesn't.  It was perfect amount of spice.  Will definately make again.

Hooray - I just discovered what I'll be serving at our New Year's Eve Party!!!  This chili recipe is absolutely the best I have ever eaten.  The italian sausage is so unique and flavorful.  I doubled the recipe so some could be frozen (if I'm going to go to all the trouble of browning the meat, chopping the veggies, etc., it made sense to make extra!)  My darling husband had two HUGE bowls and I just peeked in the family room to see he is sound asleep -- from a full and happy tummy.  Serve with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Thank you, Mighty Purdue!  You must be the most popular tailgate party in the parking lot!

Wow!  I've been looking for a vegetarian non-vegetarian tasting chili and with a little tweaking this was it!  I eliminated the meat, bouillon cubes, and canned beans substituting 2 cups of dried pinto, kidney, and small red beans that I'd soaked overnight and boiled for 1 hour.  I also added 2 seeded chopped jalapenos, 1 teaspoon of salt, a bit more cayenne, a bunch of crushed red pepper flakes, and an extra 28oz can of diced tomatos.  I threw it all in the crock pot most of the day on high.  With my variations I ended up with about 18 servings but it still tasted great and I'm gonna freeze the rest so I can eat it all winter long.  It's man chili just like my dad used to make but without the meat.  Thanks MIGHTYPURDUE22.

This was ok. I think I prefer a sweeter & more spicy chili. Maybe I will add
some hotter peppers and brown sugar if I decide to make this again.

While I liked the flavor of this chili, I found it to be too thick - not saucy enough.  So, I added 2 - 14 oz. cans tomato sauce, 2 cans water, 2 - 28 oz. cans whole tomatoes (chopped)and a little more beer.  Simmered it uncovered for about 4 hours.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the great basic recipe.

I needed to find a new recipe for this year's chili cook-off contest and thought I'd give this one a shot because of it's high rating.  We are given 6 hrs. to prepare and cook our chili on-site before the judges taste the entries.  Therefore I was looking for ease of preparation, versatility (i.e. add or omit ingredients as needed) and flavor.  Not to mention it had to hold up well without the beans.  What we have here is THIS YEARS CHILI COOK-OFF WINNER! Yea.  This has a very good flavor, texture and "bite".  Not too spicy and not too bland.  Thanks for the recipe MIGHTYPURDUE22.

I've done this recipe more than a few times now.  It is excellent as is, but I've definately fooled with the recipe a bit.  Most notably, using 4 strips of crispy cooked bacon instead of the bits.  Instead of sugar, I use half a lime squeezed in.  Finally, instead of ground chuck, I use ground sirlon, so I have little excess greese to drain off.   For a hot dog topping, I use only 2 cans of beans.  This is a great chili recipe as is, but an even better one to fool around with.

This is excellent!  I wasn't crazy about the Italian sausage in this recipe but I must admit I was the only one!  Was loved by all.  This chili is a little more time consuming than many other recipes but certainly well worth your time!

I loved this recipe.  I made it for a recent birthday at work and received wonderful reviews.  I did not add the bacon.  I did add brown sugar instead of white and a little bit of unsweetened cocoa.

This was pretty good. My husband made it for me (shock)! He said he follwed it to a "T", except he had tro leave out the beer...apparently we were out (another shock)! Definately needs the beer. So, it's quite spicy, I would suggest a little less chili powder. A little salt wouldn't hurt either. Also, 1 can of chopped grn chilies would work just as well instead of fresh. The left-overs the next day is better too!Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe.  It was just that most that ate it were not used to sausage in chili.  I would make it next time cutting out the sausage and adding either gound beef or ground turkey.

Excellent recipe.  I substituted Ranch Style beans instead of regular kidney beans and added half of a habenero pepper just to try it out.  It had some kick, but nothing too crazy.  Very tasty and will do this again!!

Wow!  My husband said best chili he had ever tasted.  We are watching our red meat intake so I used 1lb of very lean hamburger, 1 lb. ground turkey and 1/4 lb of turkey.  I browned all of the meats together.  I also used (1) 28oz can of fire roasted tomatoes with one can of regular tomatoes.  We do not like super spicy so we used 2 mild cans of beans with 1 can of hot spicy beans.   Also used Sweet Vidalia onion.

This chili is alot of work & ingredients but worth it.  After completing the chili as directed, I cooled it in the fridge until my guests arrived. I tasted it when it was completed but it was EVEN better once it was cooled and reheated.  My husband and his friends ate several bowls of it.

I loved this chili!  But instead of using some of the spicy chili ingredients, I used a jar of Amish chili mix/sauce that would be pretty much equivalent to those ingredients.

This was great. A little too spicy but I think that was my fault for my choice of hot sauce. I didn't use sausage cuz I didn't have any at the time, but used ground pork and beef. Delicious with sour cream and crackers! Boyfriend said it was the best he has ever had. YUM!

Delicious!  We've made this twice and both times it's been a huge hit!  We've made it with ground turkey and no one noticed the changed.   The fritos were a great change from corn muffins too!!

Tried this last week, the only change I made was using 2 chipolte peppers in adobo sauce (what I had) instead of the green chili peppers and I used 1/2 lb of bacon.  The end result was a quite good smokey chili with a nice slow "heat".  Will make again, husband really enjoyed, toddlers wouldn't even try....wonderful on hot dogs a couple of days later!

I made this chili for our Halloween party over the weekend. It is delicious! Everyone loved it. I actually had to stop in the middle of the party to print this recipe off for 2 of my guests! The recipe made more than plenty and the men who add hotsauce to EVERYTHING said that it was perfect and didn't need anything!Enjoy....
