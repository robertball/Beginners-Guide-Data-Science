Great stuff!  I halved the recipe and elected to use GOYA Adobo seasoning in place of Old Bay, simply because we don't care for Old Bay.  This is a winner!  I served it over Ready Rice and Beans alongside Quick Cajun Vegetables from this site.  Thanks for a great dinner, Chef John!

I live in New Orleans and this is as good a recipe for barbecue shrimp as I could find.  The only thing I changed is that I doubled the amount of butter used and serve over grits or use French bread for soaking up all the sauce.

This is an awesome recipe. Everyone in my family loves this dish! The best part was the aroma that filled the kitchen when preparing the sauce. ***so*** yummy!!! And chef John is right. Rice is the only way to go with this recipe.

This was an awesome recipe. We served it over wild rice ... delicious. The only change we made was cutting the black pepper in half. Afterwards, we thought it still needed less ... maybe 1/2 tsp. We like heat but the black pepper after taste needs adjustment.

My hubby and I both thought this was delicious. The only change I made was to use 1 teaspoon of black pepper instead of 1 Tablespoon! We are wimps when it comes to spicy food. Thanks again Chef John for another yummy recipe.

So good it hurts.  Followed recipe except I reduced my stock down more than half .  Added twice the cayenne and a tad more butter.

Nothing short of amazing!  Made and served as an appetizer for a dinner party.  My guests inhaled these shrimp and they all raved!  I didnâ€™t even get to try the dish before it was gone!  This is a keeper!

Made this for my wife. Left out the cayenne and lemon. Followed all the other steps. Served over instant rice that included carrots, peas, and corn.  We both loved it; it was delicious! The shrimp, tiger prawns, were fantastic!
 We will be enjoying this meal again!

Amazing!! I tried this for the first time to serve to dinner guests ... I had no idea how it would taste, but it sure sounded yummy. (Chef John's videos always make me hungry!) It was, and the leftovers the next day were even better - so flavorful after sitting in the sauce overnight. I followed the recipe with a few minor  changes. ... First, no pepper at all since hubby is allergic to it... added a sprinkle (about a teaspoon) of lemon peel (as my meyer lemons aren't yet ripe) and substituted celery salt for the old bay as it too has black pepper listed in the ingredients. (another teaspoon-ish)  I also decided to add about a tablespoon of dried onion and increased the garlic since we love it! Ours was fresh from Gilroy, Ca. and so flavorful! I did serve it over white rice along with freshly made salad and garlic bread. Yum, yum and more yum!! It was a big hit and we'll be making it again. Thanks Chef John!!

Turned out very well. Used only 1 pound of shrimp but the same amount of sauce. I added 2 tablespoons more of butter because my boyfriend likes rich food.

Absolutely the best recipe I have ever made.  I made exactly as written and I was blown away from the flavor.  I made fresh green beans on the side and use wild rice medley and I must say  better than restaurant .... thank u so much for this delightful recipe.  I am saving this for some special occasion with special friends. WOW!

Love this recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  Used cauliflower rice because I'm on a low carb lifestyle. No need to change a thing.

On the Atkins eating style,  so added som smoked pork leftover from the weekend,  half a chicken breast and a cup of carrot juice replaced one cup of stock, to sweeten it up. Skipped rice and added one zucchini,       chopped also added one teaspoon of cream cheese.  So start to first bite was just 30 minutes,  tops. We loved it!

Excellent recipe...cooked as written and have served to my family several times and it's always a hit, even with my 9 year old grandson.
The aroma as it's cooking is delectable and draws people to the kitchen.
Tonight I served over spaghetti squash...just made sure I had plenty of the awesome sauce!

I grew up in New Orleans and this is pretty tasty! Next time I will half the amount of lemon juice. And no one in the south uses Old Bay, itâ€™s Tonyâ€™s, Cher. So I skipped the extra cayenne. I also used thyme instead of rosemary, which was delicious. Thanks for the good template!

You CAN get your pan too hot. When I set the shrimp in, all that black pepper rose up in fumes and set us both to coughing. Still, it was delicious. I highly recommend a good beer to go with it.

Very good, made for my birthday dinner.
This version was a little too tart for me so I added about 2T Maggi sweet chili sauce and 1/4 cup of drinkable (as Chef John would say) white wine. I also cut back on the hot sauce to suit my taste.

Great recipe, I made it for 2 people so I cut the shrimp and spices in half but kept the sauce the same (we love sauce) and it was perfect.  The only change I made was to cut back on the amount of rosemary (he isn't a fan). Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.

Chef John never disappoints with our family.  I made this dish and it was awesome, will be making it again in the future.  Also, his chicken and sausage orzo is out of this world too!

First, putting this over rice is a must, I made the mistake of not doing so.  The flavors were nice/complex and very tasty.  I will definitely make it again  The only reservation is that when you reduce the brine at the end, the cayenne sort of overwhelmed.  Not a problem for me, but you're talking to a guy that slathers on hot sauce and jalapenos to all dishes.  My family is not so sympathetic to my tastes, so next time I will forgo the heat.  Overall, a winner.  Great recipe as always Chef John.

The only changes I made were due to time and cupboard restrictions. i marinated the shrimp for only thirty minutes. I didn't have colossal shrimp so I used jumbo. I also subbed 
 dried rosemary for the fresh. For our tastes, I upped the hot sauce to about a tablespoon. I will definitely make again, this time doubling the sauce ingredients to sop up with the rice.

Chef John came through again! I made this on Christmas eve after finding out my local grocer was out of my usual bottled seafood bbq sauce that we buy once a year. So JJ bought large farm raised shrimp, deveined with the tails on but no shells because they were on sale.  I followed the recipe exactly because I trust Chef John's recipes. I just did not have the shells for the added flavor, but evidently it did not matter because These were the best flavored shrimp ever. The flavor was a background flavor, if that makes sense.  Nothing too spicy cause we can't tolerate spicy. Jj and I ate 1 1/2 lbs shrimp last night between us. I am so thankful, first for Chef John's recipes, 2nd, that my local store was out of our "Usual" bottled sauce. We will continue to make this exact recipe every year for our Christmas eve meal. Thanks again, Chef John!

This recipe was amazing! I used my homemade chicken broth that I freeze whenever I make a chicken and I added thyme because I didnâ€™t have rosemary. My hubby has talked about it for weeks so tonight weâ€™re making it again but with grits! Thanks!

I have made this several times, and it comes out amazing. The only difference is that I add a lot more of the seafood seasoning. Love this dish!

I made the recipe as instructed and liked it, but if I were to make it again I'd put less lemon, if any at all, as the lemon taste came across quite strongly.

Fabulous dish. Tons of flavor. I increased the old bay and a bit extra hot sauce. I added chicken to the dish as well. Can't wait to make it for company.

Yummy! I used Old Bay along with some Cajun seasonings.  Used a little less garlic cause we don't like it to over power the other flavors. The aroma as all of the different ingredients were cooking was mouth watering.  A great recipe that you can adapt to your liking.

This was fantastic!!! I made it just like the recipe said, and even though I'm not much of a cook, it turned out delicious! The sauce is yummy by itself over rice. I can't wait to try more of Chef John's recipes! Enjoy!

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I used 1/4 tsp of ground poultry seasoning instead since that does contain rosemary. I thickened the sauce a bit with a little cornstarch at the end. Thank you Chef John, once again you've given us another winner :)
