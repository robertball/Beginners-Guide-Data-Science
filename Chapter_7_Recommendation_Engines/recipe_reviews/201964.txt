Good base recipe for Szechuan-style garlic eggplant.    Need to season the eggplant with some salt/pepper a bit while frying.  Jazz it up using fresh crushed garlic instead of the powder, at least 2 fat cloves, right at the end of stir-frying the egglplant (mellowing the garlic), along with some green onion.    For more flavor, add extra dash of oyster sauce and a good dash of fish sauce, a little more pepper flakes as well.    Goes very well with added thin-sliced pork/chicken/beef.  Just toss it in after you get the eggplant stir fryin' for a couple mins (takes less time to cook).

Love Love Loved this ~ Pretty much made as written except the following:  3 cloves fresh pressed garlic in lieu of garlic powder, chicken broth in lieu of water and 1/2 TB each of Chinese Garlic Chile Paste & Chinese Chile Paste in lieu of crushed red pepper flakes.  I couldn't believe how wonderful this turned out, better than a restaurant, I was very impressed and will make this again and again :-)

Delish!!!! I used hoisin sauce instead, since that is what I had on hand. I also reduced the sugar to 1tsp and it was plenty. So healthy and yummy at the same time! Love it!

I have made this twice now, and the second time was significantly better.
1)  Use fresh garlic if you have it!! (Or pre-chopped garlic in oil).  It tastes so much better than with the garlic powder.  I used 2-3 bulbs.
2) Ground pork tastes amazing with this dish.  I fried up the ground pork seperately to get some browning on the meat, then I drained the excess fat.  I added the whole thing to the eggplant mixture at the end of cooking.  Delicious.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was fabulous. my husband devoured it and he *never* eats eggplant. I subbed homemade vegetable stock for the water and I used 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper and two teaspoons sriracha hot chili sauce. I also used 4 tablespoons of soy instead of two as I had no oyster sauce. I also added bok choy and some diced chicken and served over brown rice. Yummy!

This is a great recipe to start with.  I like to use fresh garlic over dried - and when making Asian sauces I tend to go with brown sugar instead of white.  I also switched from soy to tamari - however, as written I'm sure the original is great too!  I loved this dish and am very happy to have found it.  I've craved Eggplant with Garlic sauce many times over the years and now when the craving hits I have the perfect recipe!  Thank you!

This is excellent.  I tried another recipe for stir fried eggplant on this site and this one is much better.  I didn't add as much sugar and garlic powder. And I didn't have any pepper flakes on hand, so I added a hint of tabasco.  It came out great.

I'd give this five stars for the taste, which is wonderful (actually, I used four big garlic cloves, instead of garlic powder), but it loses one star for the presentation. By this recipe, the eggplant turns into mush. The eggplant chunks disappear. Here's why. Frying the eggplant for 4 minutes makes perfectly cooked eggplant. But when you add the water to the hot frypan, it boils explosively before it cools. Then you simmer, and the eggplant just turns into glop. DO NOT OVERCOOK THE EGGPLANT! The water won't be "absorbed". Instead, I recommend frying for just two minutes, cooling the frypan after frying, and adding all the other ingredients mixed together. Then simmer until the cornstarch starts to congeal. That leaves you with real chunks of eggplant in a thick sauce. 

BTW, to add some protein, throw in half a cup of frozen peas. Nice.

I made this and everyone loved it.  I did it a little differently than the instructions here--I mixed up the sauce first, used fresh garlic instead of powder, and fish sauce instead of oyster.  I marinaded the eggplant cold, then stir fried it with tofu, broccoli, and scallion.  Probably the closest I've gotten to Chinese restaurant-quality in all my Chinese cooking.

Enhanced it with fresh minced garlic as well. Made it using regular small eggplants I found at the farmer´s market; there weren´t any Chinese eggplants available.

4 stars because a couple of easy changes make this much better. Use fresh garlic instead of powder and chicken broth instead of water. I also suggest adding a little grated or diced ginger.  The end result really did taste like what you would get in a good Chinese restaurant.

Very tasty! Definitely use fresh garlic and red pepper paste to freshen things up. I used about 5 cloves of garlic and about two teaspoons of chile paste. It was pretty spicy, but had great flavor. Also finished with a splash of rice vine vinegar, which was just the thing to balance and brighten the flavor. Will definitely make this again...often!

Yummy!  The local farmer's stand had these eggplant 5/1.00 - what a deal!  I made this pretty much as directed but added 1 T. fish sauce and 1 1/2 tsp. ginger paste.  I made 1 1/2 times the sauce called for as we like our dish saucey.  Served this over rice - hubs asked for seconds.  This one was a winner - I'll make this one again and again!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made it with some suggestions I read from reviews. It taste Greate! I added also thin sliced chicken breast.  30 sec before done I added 3 finely chopped cloves of garlic.  Next time I should add more of the red pepper flackes,should fry eggplant in the very hot oil to preserve color, fry 1-2 min, not more, just for color. Eggplant will get done when it will be cooking with water and sauce. Next time take 5-8 garlic cloves and squeeze them 1 min before end of the cooking. When I added garlic with sauce it took  me 5 min to get sauce thick. By that time garlic get cooked and I did not get garlicky taste I looked for. Also, add full teaspoon of red paper flakes. 1 teaspoon of sugar is plenty.

This was really really good. I used minced garlic and brown sugar like others suggested, and doubled the sauce since we were eating it with rice. I used half eggplant and half zucchini since I didn't have enough of the eggplant. SO GOOD!

Made with suggestions of others - fresh garlic and ginger, cut sugar in half, and made vegan "oyster" sauce . Used method described by another reviewer. Lightly sauted eggplant (and bok choy), then removed from pan,  prepared sauce and added back veggies to simmer until done. The sauce was Devine but a little thin. Will definitely make again! 5 stars for the flavor but knocked off a star for method.

This has a STRONG flavor!  Too strong for me surprisingly.  I think it was the oyster sauce which I have used on many occasions with no complications.  Too much of it.  I'm glad I made some rice to serve with to take away from the incredibly over powering flavor.  2 stars is all I can give.

Great recipe! This turned out really good and I will make this again. The next time I wouldn't use garlic powder, I'd suggest real garlic. The power didn't melt in as much as I'd hoped for. Other than that, this was SPICY and wonderful.

I replaced the garlic powder with minced fresh garlic and added some minced fresh ginger, too (about a Tbsp each).  I also used thai chili sauce instead of red pepper flakes and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Loved this recipe and got lots of compliments from supper club, too.  Added ground turkey to the leftovers for a main dish.  Even better than the dish that I was trying to recreate from our local Chinese restaurant.

Absolutely delicious.  I LOVE making this quick and easy curry.  I usually just use regular eggplants instead of Chinese eggplants, and I just cut them up into bite sized pieces.  Super easy, super tasty! :D

Not bad, but next time I'd have to make again using fresh mince garlic.  This much powdered garlic gave the sauce a texture I do not like. The flavor was good but the grit was weird.

Great, had a fantastic flavor and will definitely make again.  It was too spicy for my family though so willd cut back on the red pepper flakes.  Also, I was never able to get most of the water to absorb so would use 3/4 c water.

I really love eggplant, but I did not care for this. I can't believe how high its rating is. Using so much garlic powder makes the sauce pasty rather than thick. And the sauce per eggplant ratio was so unbelievably high.

I give it four stars buy my husband gives it 5. I followed the recipe except I used clam sauce instead of oyster sauce because I did not have any oyster sauce on hand. Still turned out great. Will make again.

Next time I make this I will use less oyster sauce as I found that really salty. It is the first time I cooked with oyster sauce. Also i did not put in the sugar as I am trying to eat less carbs so I sprinkled a little Splenda and it tasted very good. I was trying to replicate  the Eggplant at PF Changs and since I really cannot fully remember theirs I thought this recipe will by far meet my needs.

I made the mistake of using the recipe as written. 3TBSP of garlic powder + 1TBSP of red pepper flakes = YUCK.

Don't get me wrong, I have eaten plenty of spicy food, including the Asian variety. My gut told me 3TBSP was too much, but I let the 4.5 stars sway me - usually something rated this well does fine on its own merits. WRONG!

Now that I read all the comments, I see all the amendments and tweaks. WTH would you rate this recipe as 4 or 5 stars when you change so many of the core ingredients?

 I really should know better. The ingredients were right, but the ratio was WAY off in this recipe. Proceed with caution!!!

Oh, man...I love this recipe! Garlic eggplant is one of my favourite side dishes, but because I underwent radiation many years ago, my mouth is extremely sensitive and I can no longer tolerate even the mildest spiciness...and every restaurant around here makes garlic eggplant with hot red peppers added. So upon seeing this recipe I had to give it a try. I omitted the crushed red peppers and added fresh garlic rather than powdered (have to agree with everyone else - fresh garlic is the only way to go!), and this came out exquisitely! I can now again enjoy my favourite dish, and it takes no time to prepare either...and at a fraction of the cost of takeout. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this!

I did not care for this recipe as written. I had to make so many changes just to make it edible.  I used 1/2 tsp pepper flakes.  I reduced the water to a half cup and cooked it UNcovered.  Instead of 3 TB garlic powder,  I used one, but fresh garlic would be better.

This recipe is incredible! My favorite restaurant in NYC introduced me to this dish, and I thought it would be difficult to replicate in my own home. My first time preparing this dish, I came fairly close! I used the small round eggplants (some purple, some green Thai) instead of the typical long Chinese variety. Also, if you are anything like me, you may want to cut down slightly on the red pepper flakes, as my wife and I found this dish to be quite spicy. In any case, the flavor was a real winner!

Yummy AND easy! Instant winner. I made some seemingly popular modifications, veggie stock instead of water, three cloves of fresh garlic instead of powdered, and doubled on the soy sauce since I didn't have oyster sauce. But I also only had a big Italian-style eggplant, which I cut into 1-inch cubes, rubbed with salt and lemon pepper before throwing them in the pan, and subbed in 2 teaspoons of Stevia for the sugar for a low-cal modification. Served over brown rice - awesome!

Very, very good!  I cut my eggplant pieces a bit too small -- at the end of cooking the eggplant had broken down a little too much, but still delicious!  I followed advice of others and added a couple extra splashes of oyster sauce, and snipped some green onions to sprinkle on the top when serving.  Next time I will try adding a little fresh ginger, as others have suggested.  This is a keeper, and I look forward to making it again and again.

I made a number of modifications and it still turned out great! I sliced and quartered a full-sized eggplant and increased the cooking time, used Hoisen instead of Oyster sauce (because that's what I had) and increased the cornstarch. It was still a little spicier than I like, so I might decrease the red pepper next time. A yummy and healthy dish!

Delicious and so easy to make!  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic (and lots of it), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  To get the eggplant to cook thoroughly, after adding the sauce I reduced the heat to low and let it cook with the lid closed (stirring occasionally).  I loved it and definitely will be making it again!

I hate to comment poorly on someone else's dish that they worked hard to develop, I didn't care for this dish at all. For me, it turned out too mushy and had an unpleasant taste, and was too sweet even with 1.5tsp sugar. Even my housemates that eat anything and everything picked at this dish. I will not be making this again.

Loved this!  Only change I made was subbed Hoison sauce for the oyster because I was out of the oyster. This made it a little too sweet but the mix of flavors was excellent!  Looking forward to making it again after I buy some more oyster sauce.

I use less water or broth so the eggplant will hold up better. Sometimes I add meat.  Thinly sliced steak or chicken dusted in cornstarch and browned first.  Then remove the meat and do the rest as written. Near the end,returnthe meatto the pan and the cornstarch on the meat will thicken the sauce.

I received some  Chinese eggplant in my weekly vegetable box and had no idea what to do with them.  I made this, but I left out the red pepper flakes because my family can't handle spicy anything.  I had to add red pepper to my dish separately but overall, this recipe was a huge hit!  It wasn't the prettiest looking dish, but I made it as a main course with rice and even my pickiest eater ate every last bit on his plate!  Anything that my picky 11 year old will gobble up deserves 5 stars in my book!  I am planning on making it again but this time I think I will add some cut-up boneless skinless chicken thighs to give it a little more substance.

When the water evaporated, clumps of garlic mush was all over my eggplant.  I added the soy sauce with extra water to try and dissolve the garlic mush.  The whole dish reeks of a very artificial garlic flavor.

Thank you for this recipe! The dish is a bit sweet as is, but I think if I put less in the next go around it should be good. Good with rice! Stir in ground turkey for extra flavor. .

This is perfect! The only things I did differently was cut up the eggplant and coat in salt and place on a rack to drain out some of the bitter flavor. I also had to use some minced garlic because I ran out of garlic powder. But the dish is excellent! I will be making this a dish I come back to in the future, and it pairs well with the Classic Fried Rice recipe on this site.

Great recipe.  Used 4 Cloves fresh garlic instead of powder and garlic chili paste instead of red chili flakes.  I add marinated chicken to dish for main meal.

I used regular eggplant, through in some chicken,chicken stock, fish/oyster/hoisin sauces, 3 cloves of minced garlic, brown sugar and served over jasmine rice.  Will make again but will try substituting Splenda for the brown sugar.

Easy and delicious. I prefer my eggplant to be super soft, but those saying this was too mushy can try using less oil and water.

Like others, I substituted some ingredients. Minced garlic instead of powder, chicken stock instead of water, red chili paste instead of red pepper flakes. It didn't really need the sugar (I tried with Splenda), nor the cornstarch. I recommend a non-stick large pan (not a wok, as I did) or your pan will burn. A pain to clean up! All in all a very quick and easy recipe - a lot of bang for your buck! Tastes better than restaurant made, and much healthier, since you can control what goes in it. Oh and I added sautéed tofu. A definite repeat!

The taste is good, but the proportions are off. 1/2 cup of water was excessive. I would personally double the amount of sauce and half the amount of water.

I didn't have chinese eggplant, so I used a medium sized normal one cubed into 1-1.5 inch chunks.  I wanted this to be a full dinner entree to have over rice, so I separately browned ground turkey beforehand, and combined that at the last step to cover it with the sauce. 

I also used fresh garlic and added a squirt of hoisin sauce at the end.  DELICIOUS.  I will be making this again and again to have over rice or noodles!

Practically inedible.  The texture and look was right.  The taste, however, was off.  I thought it was too salty or perhaps too sour (fish sauce).  My partner thought it had too much chili.  We're used to spicy food--Sichuan is one of our favorite cuisines--but the balance of the sauces and spices in this was wrong.

Eggplant with garlic sauce is my favorite Chinese dish, and this recipe is very good.  I modified this recipe based on several others' suggestions.  I seasoned the eggplant with salt and pepper, and then added fresh garlic to the stir-fried eggplant (5 cloves).  I also added more oyster sauce, a dash of fish sauce, and some sesame oil to the sauce.  I topped it with green onions, and it was just delicious!  I think it will be even better tomorrow after it sits in the fridge.

LOVED this - especially how quick and easy it is to make.  I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic, olive oil and a bit of butter instead of canola and 4 tbsp. of light soy sauce instead of oyster sauce.  Just because I didn't have canola oil or oyster sauce on hand - and I'm a huge fan of fresh garlic over dried.  I'm sure it is delicious the way it is written and I will definitely be making it again!

Yum! Use all 5 tsp sugar! I used less sugar as recommended by other reviewers but regret it!  It should have been sweeter, like the original recipe calls for.  I used a ton of fresh garlic and a little garlic powder too.  And this recipe can be adapted with any other ingredients- onion, tofu, mushrooms, etc!  Chicken broth instead of water is good too.

Very good! Expect a lot of spice with this dish! I cut the sugar down a bit (3 teaspoons), oil (2 tablespoons).  Maybe that's why mine was a really spicy.  But it was still very good to eat (but spicy!) and I was glad to cut the sugar/fat down a tiny bit.  I also meated up the dish with two large tomatoes and a red onion.

I was surprised by this dish as I don't like eggplant.  I didn't like the garlic powder usage, as one person pointed out, it made the sauce pasty rather than thick.  I'm going to follow the alternate directions next time, and use fresh garlic.  It's still going to become a regular for me, though!

It's a good base recipe but the key for me is you need to cook down the eggplant. It definitely needs to be in semi-mush mode otherwise it tastes too "green". In the future, I will use more water or toss in a little salt at the beginning to get the eggplant to expel some water and cook it down. There should be a little left over water prior to throwing in the sauce ingredients. Otherwise it's too "dry". Based on what others recommended, I reduced the sugar to 1 tsp., used hot dried chili peppers and green onions. As well, I threw in 4-5 sliced fresh shiitake mushrooms. DH loved the mushrooms but didn't care for the eggplant! Will definitely be trying this recipe again!

Pretty good.  I think a bit more cornstarch was needed as the sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked but the result was still good.  For those who aren't a fan of eggplant, you can substitute with pork and it takes just as a good.

This is great! I absolutely love eggplant, but have been fearful about cooking it.  I used the regular eggplant, which yielded more than 4 servings.  Therefore, I had to double the sauce.  I added ground chicken and served over  jasmine rice.  Delicious!

WOW! Used regular eggplant from the garden, peeled & chopped into 1" chunks. Resident Food Critic prefers smaller pieces, so will accommodate her next time.
Great flavors, nice heat, and easy to do. Think I'll wok it next time just for fun.

Very good! I was surprised how close it was to traditional Chinese cooking considering how fast and easy it is. I also recommend following the suggestions of the other users on here and using fresh garlic instead of powdered and seasoning with salt and pepper before frying. Also I recommend topping with chopped, raw green onion at the end for a litte bite!

Excellent.  Yes, I modified for family taste.  Added okra, broccoli raab, and portabella mushrooms.  Don't like spicy, so eliminated that.  Watching sugar so used only 2t splenda.  Outstanding folks!

The part that I would change is where you add water and then cover... it turns the eggplant to mush... If you don't cover and add water at the same time as the soy and the other ingredients the texture is great!

Pretty easy to make.  The flavour was pretty good.  But the eggplant turned to mush. So it was more like a spread than a side dish.   Only 1 out of 3 family members liked it.  If I ever made it again I wouldn't cook it for as long.  And serve it right away while it still retained it's shape.

Great recipe! Restaurant Worthy! Family loved it, even the picky eater!  I agree with other reviewers, 10 mins cooking in water = mushy. I cooked it 5 min until reduced by half. This also allows for more sauce, which is the big hit of this dish.  I also added/sauteed chicken, onion, green peppers first for a few minutes, then added the eggplant and lots of fresh garlic. I used Thai Chili Paste instead of pepper flakes. Yum!  It's a keeper! (The moment the meal was over negotiations started over who would be taking the leftovers for lunch the next day !  It was that good! haha :) Thank you, "What's that Burning smell?"!

Wonderful!  I have yet to find anyone down here in Dallas who has ever heard of this, let alone made it (even in Chinese restaurants!).  I did change the garlic powder to fresh garlic chopped roughly, because I could not imagine doing such a lovely dish without fresh ingredients. I also added scallions and snow peas as well as mushrooms. It was all really delicious!

As another reviewer said, this turns your eggplant to a bunch of salty brown mush.

Thanks for posting this!  I made a few changes, just to reflect my personal tastes, but the basic recipe is perfect. I started with  caramelizing a diced onion before adding the eggplant. Like others, I used some chicken broth, but mixed with the water, and fresh garlic. I also added a tablespoon of fresh ginger. I added a splash of rice vinegar and some toasted sesame oil to the sauce. Definitely going to repeat this often!

This eggplant recipe was perfectly delicious exactly the way it is. I did not change a thing and my family loved it. It’s a keeper. We had left over and I had it for lunch the next day cold right out of the refrigerator on bread. Yum! Thanks for a great eggplant recipe.

Greet recipe! Served it over white rice. I cooked  green onions with the eggplant. I added about an extra teaspoon of sugar to the sauce and used double the soy sauce and omitted the oyster sauce. It was a bit too spicy for my hubby, so I’ll half the red pepper flakes next time.

My husband thought he hated eggplant, but he loved this recipe.  I did use sesane oil and added more oyster sauce.  this was AMAZING!  A bit hot, but we like that. I will definitely make this again and again.

Absolutely delicious dish.  Easy to make and very tasty.  Next time I make this dish, I will cut back on the sugar, maybe by half. and the red pepper flakes by half as well.

I adapted some features from another recipe I found online. I started by cooking the cut up Chinese eggplant for one minute in boiling water and then drained it on paper towels. I set the eggplant aside and prepared a sauce of 3 Tbl. soy sauce, 1tbl. Rice vinegar, 1tbl. Sherry (or rice wine), 1/2 tsp. Sugar, and 1tbl. Chili garlic sauce. I heated 2 tbl. Oil in the wok and added 4 garlic cloves, 1  tbl. fresh ginger, and 2 scallions, all chopped very fine. I then added 1/2 onion sliced thin and 1/2 red (or green) pepper, stir fried 2-3 minutes (extra veggies are optional). I then added the combined sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, chili garlic sauce, etc. After heating for 1-2 minutes I added the eggplant and stir fried to combine. Covered, lowered heat, simmered for 10 minutes. Then I added a mixture of 1/2 tsp. Cornstarch and water to thicken. I think the texture and taste came out great. Delicious!

I used Hoisin sauce instead of oyster sauce. Used a pinch of splenda instead of sugar. Made sure eggplants were 90% cooked before I added the sauce. Used steel pan and worked very well  Used fresh garlic and ginger and added marinated pork for a few minutes and then green onions to top off.

This was really very tasty. Didn’t have oyster sauce, so used a tad bit of water and tad bit of fish sauce.  Served these veggies with a fried wild rice and Chinese chicken. Was a nice dinner.

Great recipe exactly as written but with lots of room for play to change it up. As is it is pretty mild, I added some garlic chili sauce to my serving and it was amazing - the rest of the family was happy with it as is. 

Some reviewers said it turned to mush - I think to avoid this you need to stick to the 4 minutes on the original cook and then stop simmering when there is still some water in the pan, maybe ~1/4 cup. It will add to the sauce and get thickened up just fine and the eggplant won't get mushy from cooking too long.

I did not add oyster sauce as I did not have it on hand. I added extra soy sauce instead. This was delicious!

Made this with one medium eggplant from a friend's garden, a little less than 1 tb of garlic powder, and a sprinkle of red pepper flake with 1/2 c water.  Did make the whole recipe of sauce though because it's delicious!  Would be good with mushrooms too

The flavor is wonderful, but I have yet to figure out the liquid absorption. It says a cup of water, simmered and covered but that takes forever to absorb. I've tried to cut the water to half a cup but no success. Great taste but it's sometimes either too mushy or too watery.

The garlic powder left a bit of grainy residue on top of the eggplant, which made for poor presentation.  Would use freshly chopped garlic next time instead!

This was fantastic!  Instead of eggplant I substituted ground beef and then replaced the other spices with chili powder and it was incredible! But seriously folks, I followed the recipe word for word and it was deeee-licious!  :)

This recipe when made to specs is NASTY.  3T garlic powder?  1T red pepper flakes?   DIFFICULT TO EAT.   We threw the entire dish out, and were scared to give it to our canine goat, we were afraid she would throw up.

This is just so great. Even my 14-month-old loved this. Make sure you don't cook the eggplant too long or it will become a little mushy; I don't really mind but some people might. I saw some other reviews suggesting fresh garlic but honestly I think the taste of the powdered garlic was perfect. I threw in some mushrooms too during the simmering stage for a little something "extra." Will definitely make again!

LOVE IT!! Very much like the Spicy Eggplant from P.F. Changs.

Admittedly I made many substitutions based on what I had:

1 can extra thick Coconut Milk instead of  water
Fresh Garlic instead of  garlic powder
Dark Mushroom Soy Sauce instead of  no light Soy Sauce
1 Tbsp flour instead of  corn Starch
fish sauce instead of  oyster sauce
brown sugar instead of  white sugar
Avocado Oil instead of  canola Oil
1tbsp chili oil & 1tsp red pepper instead
2 Chinese Eggplants and 1/2 lb Shiitake mushrooms

Turned out very mushy and too sweet, but this recipe seems like a good base to work from. Next time I will tweak based on other reviews: fresh garlic added at the end instead of granulated, use brown sugar & reduce the amount, and half the amount of water using chicken stock. I will be giving this another go even though I wasn't pleased with my initial result, I see the potential for a truly great recipe!

Hoping someone will see this, but please go to Most Helpful until you get to DougL's review. I think his tip is the trick and would work right. Mine turned to mush and I think simply frying for 2 minutes and in batches too perhaps. Then, add the other ingredients. Flavor wise, it's a little on the bitter side. So, do use fresh garlic and not powdered (about 3-4 cloves, minced).  Also, seemed to be missing something, perhaps a little ginger. I added a little extra oyster and soy sauce too. I may try this again, but following DougL's recommendations or a different recipe all together.

This is delicious!  I simmered uncovered (and kept a watchful eye the entire time) to allow much of the water to evaporate and avoid the eggplant becoming too mushy.

I really loved this recipe.  I used mini eggplant and made a double recipe.  I used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce and Bragg's aminos for the soy sauce in the recipe.  It was excellent! I read the reviews and cooked the recipe with about ½ the water and used 5 cloves of garlic in this double recipe instead of garlic powder. The eggplant got a little overdone, so I would add the sauce mixture earlier next time and let the eggplant cook while the sauce thickened.  It was a little too spicy for me.  But, that is easy to correct.  I will definitely make again. Yummy!!!

Wonderful flavor. The eggplant seems to soak up that tasty sauce. I used honey instead of sugar and fresh garlic and onion. I served it over brown and wild rice combo.

I was trying to lower sodium so I cut back on the soy and oyster sauce but I did use a low sodium chicken broth. Also substituted sambal for the red pepper flakes. It was very yummy. Added some stir fry chicken breast at the last minute. Would do the same again. My husband and I both liked it for dinner as well as leftovers for lunch.

I make this recipe to rave reviews with just a few changes: fresh garlic and ginger instead of powdered,  and garlic chili sauce instead of red pepper flakes :) just make this! Just as good as Chinese restaurant takeout at a fraction of the price :) this is coming from a Chinese girl whose family has owned and operated one for the last 30 years!

This was amazing, the layered flavors are great. I added 1 tsp fresh ginger, 1 handful of shallots and 1 lb shrimp. I also slivered 10 cloves of fresh garlic and used Sriracha instead of red pepper flakes. I hate eggplant and I couldn't stop eating this! Thank you so much for giving me a way to use up the eggplants from my mom's garden!

A tablespoon of crushed chili is a little too hot for me; I'll probably half it next time. I used three fresh cloves of garlic instead of the powered variety because I didn't have any powered.  Overall, simple and tasty; I will be revisiting this one!

Tasty dish! I seasoned the eggplant with salt, garlic powder, ginger powder and the crushed red pepper. Once in the skillet I added fresh garlic. I wanted to make sure they didn't turn to complete mush like many of the reviews. So I seared the eggplant then added the water and cooked until just tender. I poured off the excess water. I did not use corn starch or sugar. Oyster sauce is sweet enough. Directly to the skillet I added a oyster sauce and a touch of soy sauce. Adjusting the mixture as needed for taste. Ultimately it was about 4 tablespoons of oyster sauce to 1-2 of soy.  I added a teaspoon of sriracha sauce also. My husband and I have always hated eggplant.  We do a bi-weekly food co-op and always give our eggplant away. We won't be doing that anymore. We recently went to a restaurant that served a spicy eggplant. We loved it. This is very similar. Great flavors and we will eat it again!!!

The only change I made was making rice to go with it as it curbs some of the heat. It won't turn out mushy if you start by cooking the eggplant for 4 mins only on high heat regardless if they are completely soft or not, add the additional spices the garlic and crushed red pepper flakes water and continue cooking -the water will soften the eggplant...continue to cook on high heat then add the other stuff later on....don't cook for too much longer....shouldn';t be cooked longer than 5 mins after that.  make sure you add salt and pepper liberally or may be slightly bland. It was ok but not the best my son is picky and he didn't like it.

I didn't have oyster sauce on hand, so I used fish sauce sparingly. I don't like that overwhelming fish taste.  I also went light with the red pepper flakes. I like spicy but too much can wreck a good dish. I saw a complaint about this turning mushy. I can see how that could happen easily, because mine almost was like that. After adding the water, I would only let it cook about 3-4 min, even if some of the water is not absorbed. Added a little sweet chile sauce at the end. Nice recipe!

Like some of the other reviewers, I decided to use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder--turned out to be a great decision. The dish turned out amazing and tasted delicious!

Amazing, great, wonderful!  Easy to make.   I follow some of the suggestions about the fresh garlic, ginger, and reduce the sugar.  I also didn't use all the brown sauce bc I'm "trying" to reduce the amount of salt and sugar in my diet, so I just added little by little to my liking.  Beside the eggplant, chicken stock, garlic, ginger  was  amazing itself.

Agreed with the other reviewers, definitely used fresh garlic, once I added the powdered garlic, the entire dish was so fragrant. Instead of using white sugar, I used agave (seemed healthier), and there is already a high sugar content on the oyster sauce.

I used 3 medium Japanese eggplant from my garden.  I replaced the oil with 1Tb of coconut oil and reduced the sugar to 1Tb of turbanado sugar.  Great result  with the subtle coconut flavor and I did not miss the rest of the sugar.  I did add a little water at the end to have a sauce that glazed the eggplant pieces.

made a few modifications based on the reviews:  subbed home made beef stock for the water, fresh cayenne pepper for crushed red pepper (used 3), fresh garlic for garlic powder (used 2), and brown sugar instead of granulated (used 2.5 tsp instead of 5).  Also added S&P when sautéing eggplant and a few dashes of fish oil to the sauce.  I did find the eggplant more cooked down than the pictures showed, but served over rice and fresh spinach and it was to die for. LOVE!!!

This is a great base recipe! I use a few cloves of real garlic because I don't like the taste of garlic powder. I've made an easy, cheap, healthy meal out of this by adding tofu and noodles. Onions, shallots, green beans, carrots, or any other spare vegetables you have are good in this as well.

Definitely had lots of flavor. I cut down on the sugar and substituted cornstarch with tapioca starch; was excellent with brown rice! 4/5 mostly because I felt it was too salty and a bit too spicy for me. Would make it again though but will cut down on the sodium a bit.

What the heck did I do wrong?  Well, I think I know.  I peeled the egg plant before I cooked it.  Oops.  Don't do that.  My dish turned out to be a sauce (mish mash mush).   It was also very gross with the oyster sauce.  If I had not used the oyster sauce, it probably would have been better tasting.

Yum! Followed recipe to the tee so I could give it a fair rating.  I did cook the eggplant longer because I do like the eggplant soft.  Also, if I were to make it again, I would probably use chopped garlic in the canola oil vs. garlic powder.  My 11 year old daughter who normally doesn't like eggplant ate this up! She really liked it... Would definitely make it again!

good base recipe, made a few changes.  like another reviewer i had no oyster sauce, but i did have some fish sauce, so i used 1T of that and added an extra 1T of soy sauce.  diced the eggplant and soaked it in salt water for 30 minutes then drained, rinsed and dried before cooking.  thin sliced 3 cloves garlic and used only 1t of garlic powder.  had a jalapeno so i diced half of it and added with the garlic, cut down on the crushed red pepper by half.  used no sugar and cut the water in half.  added some cut green beans because i had some that needed to be used  served over quinoa.  it was amazing!

The first time I made this it was better then how my Chinese husband tried to make it! It's perfect. the next time I made it I doubled the sauce and added yellow onions  and topped it with green onions and sesame seeds. Perfect over rice and a dish of general chicken or your favorite meat dish. Enjoy enjoy enjoy! Thank you for this recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I threw in some zucchini as well. The sauces was remarkably easy and quite tasty. I will be using this in the future!!

This is a great basic recipe.  I followed the advice of a couple different reviewers and used extra soy sauce in substitute of oyster sauce.  I added 2 tbs. chile sauce. Reduced sugar to 2tps., and used 3 cloves fresh garlic. I cooked rice and chicken and added 1/2 tbs crushed red peppers to that instead of eggplant.  My skeptical husband LOVED it!
~~HINT~~ after sauteing the eggplant, add garlic and cook for 1 min. longer and then start adding water (veggie broth) about an 1/8 of a cup at a time. It helps make the absorption process go faster.

I had a craving for this dish. The recipe was great. In addition to the garlic powder, I used fresh garlic, ginger and scallions. And for those of you who cannot consume cornstarch like me, use arrowroot instead. It turned out delicious.

I had zucchini, not eggplant, so I sauted it (took 10 minutes for each of two batches), using maybe about 2/3 as much oil.  I skipped the simmering step, and when adding the cornstarch-soy-sugar mixture, gradually added maybe 1/2 cup water.  (I also completely omitted the red pepper, but that's because toddlers were eating it -- ordinarily I wouldn't -- and oyster sauce, because I didn't have any.)  To my mind, it was even better than with eggplant.  But both ways are delish.

This was a super easy recipe for eggplant. I did however make some changes. I used coconut oil instead of canola,  fish sauce for oyster sauce, and opted for a soy sauce that had no MSG. It was fantastic served on brown basmati rice with cabbage salad, and split pea curry. YUM

This is really good, using fish sauce, yster sauce and fresh garlic as others have suggested.

Delish and so easy even I was able to pull it off. I used 3 garlic cloves and a Serrano pepper instead of garlic powder and pepper flakes. I also added portabello mushrooms right before the 1 cup of water and WOW.

Just okay. I wasn't floored by it. I thought it was maybe too sweet, and not spicy or salty enough.

I was looking for an eggplant dish that was similar to the one my stepmom makes. This dish was headed in the right direction but didn't make it all the way there. Still a decent meal though.

I LOVED this recipe.  The garlilc was just enough and the eggplant turned out perfectly.  I would highly recommend this recipe.
