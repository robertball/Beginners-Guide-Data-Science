My husband LOVED this recipe.  He is on a restricted salt diet and finding tasty condiments is a huge help for me.  I am going to try it with red wine vinegar for myself and I am sure it will be just as tasty!   Thanks for the hubby pleasin' recipe.

This wasn't bad, but not being being on a salt restricted diet and not used to "salt-free" dressing I did add some Morton's lite salt which is what I'm used to using. I can see where those on that type of diet would find this dressing very nice as is.

I just have to tell you that this is the best recipe that I have found that out shines all the rest.  How you have so few ratings is beyond me.  This is also very versatile and you can use it to marinate meats with a simple change with a few different ingredients, or you can sprinkle it on fruits for a really unique flavor.  Great recipe!!! thank you so much.

I cut out most salt out of my diet in my 20's realizing how bad sodium is so this recipe caught my eye.  It's fantastic!  I could not imagine needing to add salt.

Very easy and quick to make in a pinch.   lacks a bit of flavor however, the no salt is a healthy benefit for those battling hypertension

Finally some Flava! I am on a restricted salt/fat diet and have been trying to find a salad dressing with some flavor! This is the ticket! It is bursting with flavor, the combination of ingredients is perfect! Not too "heavy" with oil like most recipes I've found. Light and crisp with the lemon (I used fresh lemon). This is a keeper and I make it every weekend to last. As I like garlic I added more on the second batch, but I have to tell you, it was better with just the 2 cloves, that was perfect! Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was a very good dressing. Great for people on a low sodium diet as bottled dressings have quite a bit of sodium.

I changed the recipe just a little. I used 1/2 Tablespoon of the Italian seasoning, (we're not big fans of it), and just a bit more lemon juice.(I used fresh lemon and used up all that I had squeezed). It's a nice simple dressing that I used over a cucumber and tomato salad.

Great recipe for anyone, not just salt-restricted diets. It doesn't call for any sugar, either, like many vinaigrettes do.  All ingredients were already in my kitchen cabinet or fridge, which allowed me to throw it together early in the day and forget it until dinnertime. I have made it a few times, using whatever kind of vinegar I had on hand, white or red wine(have not tried balsamic.) Delicious!

Great recipe. Made my own red wine vinegar (1 part red wine, 3 parts white vinegar) and added about 1/2 cup more red wine vinegar and a pinch more garlic than the recipe called for and it was terrific.  Thanks!!!

This isn't a terribly involved recipe, but I still think it's the first time I've ever made a dressing from a recipe. I made it exactly as written, and served it over green salad, for four lunches. It was pretty nice; the lemon juice added a nice taste to it. Worth making again if I don't want to just "wing it" on salad dressings like I usually do.

I made this as specified, & it tasted marvelous -

I was making pasta salad, & had half a jar of Pesto left over from a prior meal;  I added the Pesto to this vinaigrette, whisked them together, & dressed my rotini / pprs / tomato / olive / red onion / diced olives salad.
Yum! --- we all enjoyed both the dressing, & the dish.
:--) Will definitely keep this as a go-to standard.

I love the flavor, but what's the best way to store?  I made it yesterday for today and stored it in the refrigerator.  But I had to let it set out for some time because the oil had set.

Being on a low sodium diet, I was glad to find this. I found it to be very tasty and a great alternative to the higher fat and higher sodium store bought dressings. I'll definitely be making this again.

My Mother-in-law is on a no sodium diet so finding salad dressings in the store is near to impossible this receipe is Wonderful it's easy to make and has incredible flavor you don't need salt because the Red Vinegar gives it the zip you need so this will be a dressing I will make her for home!!!! I really wish I could find a No Salt Vidila onion dressing !!!!!! Thanks for sharing this

Easy peasy to make.  I added fresh herbs -- basil, rosemary, and thyme -- to the dried ones in the bottled Italian seasoning. Took the flavor to a whole new, yummy level!  Will make it again and again to help reduce my sodium intake.

Used less olive oil 1/4 and substituted with apple cider vinegar as that I had that on hand. Added a slash of balsamic. Extremely flavourful.

Made it this morning. Although I personally did not care for it (way too twangy for my tastes)... my mother (whom is the reason I made it) LOVED it!!! My 9yr old niece and 3yr old nephew loved it as well. So that is all that matters to me! 
Thank you for sharing with us!
