I always like to read reviews on a recipe before making it and I'm glad I did in this case because it has made this simple dish, taste phenomenal. Firstly, I cannot believe someone tried to make this without cooking the meat first--I was under the impression that was Cooking 101 common sense. Secondly I substituted Cream of Chicken for the Celery, I also added half of a chopped onion and garlic powder in lieu of garlic. After cooking the ground beef and onion, I mixed it with both of the soup mixtures and 1 cup of 2% milk. I then layered mild cheddar cheese on top of that and then on the very top I put the frozen tater tots. There is no need to thaw them. I baked it at 375 for 60 minutes. The tater tots were nice and crispy with cheese oozing around them--and it was absolutely delicious. I am making it tonight, for the second time in two weeks. I will definitely make it again---and again.

I made this with a few changes. I didn't add the milk, I used one can of cream of chkn, and one can of cream of mushroom. I layered the ground beef on the bottom, then the soup mixture, then I added a mixture of frozen vegetables (thawed), followed by about 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, and finally, the tator tots on top. Baked for close to an hour. It's one of our favorites.

I modified this slightly and my husband and I agreed it was delicious.  The kids even liked it.  I added a small chopped onion to the beef, a can of french cut green beans to the soup and milk mixture, and french fried onions to the top.  I baked it for 30 minutes covered (so the onions wouldn't burn) and another 30 minutes uncovered.  This was really good.  I think the garlic powder gave it some extra flavor.

You obviously have to cook the hamburg first.  I substituted the can of milk with 2% milk and used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of the celery.  The tater tots do not need to be thawed either. Also the last 1/2 hour of baking I added french fried onions.  It was really good!!

This was good... it also made good leftovers.  I browned the meat first, put it in the bottom, covered with soup mixture and a can of green beans and about a cup of shredded cheddar.  Then I topped with the tater tots.

I thought this was a great recipe.  Like others, I browned the hamburger first and added green beans and shredded cheese to the recipe.  I brought it as a side dish to a family barbecue and everyone loved it!

The recipe was very bland.  It needed something to spice it up.  We may play with the recipe and try adding some things such as cheese, onions, or green peppers.

This was so simple and delicious. My husband had two helpings and can't wait for the leftovers. I browned the ground beef with some diced onions and minced garlic and put it into a 7x11 dish. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese over the tator tots before adding the soup mixture, and topped the whole casserole with shredded cheddar cheese.

I've made this casserole about a hundred times, and with a few different variations. I used to use the Breakfast tater-tots, and with great success... but I found the small regular hashbrowns work really well, cause you can mix it with the soup base and really blend the flavours. It makes for great leftovers, and amazing for families. I like the cream of mushroom but I actually have better results with cream of chicken and celery. And I add a bit of corn too for extra flavour. Happy Cooking!

I added cheese to this receipe - My husband said he might eat it again - One of my kids thought it was OK, the other one didn't like it at all.  I thought it was OK, but it was sort of bland.

Funny, I've been making a similar version of this for years, and I have never browned the meat first. I cook it for 1h15m at 350 and a meat thermometer shows the meat is well over the 165 degrees it needs to be. I don't know why you need to cook it so long if you have already cooked the meat. I'll continue not browning it - why the extra step and dishes? Just thought I would share that it definitely works, a 350 degree oven will cook it for you.

This is similar to a recipe I always used but couldn't find mine but once I seen most of it I could recall where I added or changed.

Best thing to do is season your ground beef while it is in the browning processing. Add salt, pepper, onions, green peppers, and 1/2 Tbsp of minced garlic (or use the 1st pinch of Garlic Powder).
Beginner Cooks use minced garlic left it tends to burn quick in a hot pan and leave a bitter taste.
 
Adding a package (2 cup size pkg) of Shredded Cheddar Cheese (or your choice type shredded cheese) is a MUST. 
I also mix the tater tots, hamburger, soups, seasonings of choice, 1/2 to 3/4 the pkg (1-1 1/2 cup) of shredded cheese and milk in bowl til the tots are coated then place in the baking pan and top with remaining shredded cheese the last 20 minutes of the baking time.

For Health Nuts or Low Sodium version:
Use Ground Chuck (at least a 90/10) or you can use a lean meat like ground chicken or ground turkey.  I use Sea Salt vs table salt when cooking. This way I use half the amount of sea salt vs when using regular table salt. Cream of Mushroom & Celery soups I get the Healthy Request or Low/Less Sodium versions. I also use skim milk with my cooking. (You can always add more salt to your taste level but you can't take it out.)

I used 85% lean beef, and this dish came out really greasy. Next time I'll be sure to use a lot leaner beef. I also halved the recipe, but instead of using only half of each can of soup, I used the whole can of cream of celery and half the can of cream of mushroom. I mixed it into the beef, instead or pouring it over the top. It came out very good, despite the grease!

Yum! You gotta try subbing Cheddar Cheese or Nacho Cheese Soup instead of one of the other soups! Amazing! I did add some chopped onion and garlic while browning the meat and added a layer of frozen mixed vegetables and instead cooked on 400 degrees for 30 minutes and the taters browned nice and crispy. I didn't understand why it needed to cook for 1 hour when the only thing that needed to cook were the Tater Tots?  Tossed a handful of shredded mexican cheese on top! I let everyone season with a seasoned salt & pepper blend at the table for their own taste. I added a photo of the glorious outcome!

Good base recipe.  With some adjustments it came out to be a great kid-friendly casserole.  I used ground turkey instead and cooked with minced garlic and a diced onion.  After draining, I added both soups and milk to the mixture along with some frozen mixed veggies (steamfresh halfway cooked) added the pepper and some italian seasoning. Put mixture in baking dish and covered with frozen tots.  Baked for a bit then added shredded cheddar and some more italian seasoning.  Family loved it.

This is a great recipe to play with and is family-friendly (everyone loves it). I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, and substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of celery and cream of mushroom. I sprinkled on  little celery salt and freshly diced onion (compliments of my mini food processor) before pouring the soup mixture on top and used my own seasoning combination for the meat. I also used regular milk instead of canned. It was soooo good!

This is a great recipe.  I added corn to it and omitted the garlic powder (didn't have any) .  I also browned the hamburger with half an onion before mixing ing. together.  So comforting.

All in all it was a pretty good dish.  I took into some consideration the reviews of others, instead of milk, added a cream of chicken also.  Browned the hamburger meat beforehand and also seasoned it with garlic and onion.  I also added a can of Rotel with added cilantro to it and cheese in the last 10 minutes.  Family liked it also.  Great recipe if you buy too many tots  :)

Used cream of mushromm and chicken, 2% milk and bag of mixed veggy's.  Veggy's was the best flavor it had.  Added more salt and pepper wasn't bad.  It wasn't the best, but not bad either.  Will make again with added spices.

My family LOVED this! I did make adjustments. My family doesn't like garlic so I left it out. I used ground chuck. Browned it first, then blotted out the grease on paper towels. I then mixed the meat with 1 can condensed cream of CHICKEN and 1 can condensed cream of CELERY soup in the bottom of my casserole dish (I didn't want to thin out my sauce so I didn't use milk). I added one can, drained, corn, spread around. I sprinkled on 1.5 cups shredded cheddar. Then I arranged a bag of EXTRA CRISPY tater tots on TOP of everything. Don't pour the soups over the tater tots unless you are going for shepherd's pie/soggy tots! Cooked for 40 minutes and then added 1 cup shredded cheddar on top of casserole over the tots. Cook for 20 more minutes. The only thing I would do differently next time is use one of the cans low sodium soup bc it was a bit salty. This casserole was WONDERFUL!!! Tried this again, but wanted less salty. Didn't have reduced sodium soups, so I used half can on CC. Didn't help enough. I will leave out altogether next time and MAYBE add a 1/4-1/2 can milk. I also wanted crispier cheese/tators so when I added the extra/topping cheese, I increased oven temp to 425. Added FF onions to a portion for kids durning last 5 minutes. The tots and cheese topping were crispy and AMAZING!! Disappointed at the saltiness still. Will work on that next time.

I was weary of the ingredients, but after reading all the reviews, I had to go for it.... Especially with all of my super picky eaters.  But our family of 8 loved it.  I followed the first reviewers recipe and it turned out amazing.

I basically did the same thing as "Heatherina" (but added some blanched peas) and this dish was perfection! Nothing better than meat, potatoes and cheese. Great comfort food. The kids love it!

I did cream of chicken instead of celery. I also added 1 cup of sour cream. I added a cup of shredded white cheddar cheese during the last fewm minutes of baking. (A WISCONSIN THING). Then at the end of baking we broiled for about 4 min.

Hubby and I loved it, just a basic yummy hotdish. Cream of celery is a nice touch I would not have thought of to use in a hotdish. We also did beef and ground pork for a nice extra flavor.

I made this with cubed ham that I browned with celery, onions, and the garlic.  I also used unthawed extra crispy tater tots and it was delicious!

My husband says excellent!  I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom soup instead of celery.  I used 1 cup of 2% milk instead of canned milk.  And I followed others recommendations and added shredded cheese.  Absolutely delicious!  Perfect meal for a cold winter day...

This is a cheap meal, not classy, not that great.  I think I always use too much of something because my tots are always soggy.  I will keep making it, because it's cheap and I like tater tots.  Ketchup make it better!

For an extremely easy recipe, it has an extremely good taste! I use two cans of mushroom soup instead of using the cream of celery. I love this recipe.

This is a recipe that has been so common since I was a kid that it didn't occur to me people hadn't heard of it. Maybe it's the Minnesota hotdish thing! The way we make it is to brown the hamburger first in a skillet, then crumble into a 9x9 inch pan for every pound of hamburger. Layer 1 can of cream of mushroom soup over the hamburger, than a vegetable (most commonly used is orn or a vegetable blend) than you only have to bake in the oven for as long as it takes the tater tots to brown. Cheese is good on it but that was never added when I was a kid. I like to throw some feta in after its done. One thing to remember is that if you double the hamburger, double the soup, veggies, etc. Easy and REALLY good!

I added garlic and onion while cooking the ground beef, and then added some bell pepper and broccoli near the end. I used a can of cream of celery and cream of chicken (what I had on hand) and put a little cheese on top before placing in the oven. (didn't use any garlic powder)  It turned out super yummy, with lots of flavor!  I put a little hot sauce on my piece for a little extra kick but it was good without it.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this. After reading other reviews...I added chopped onion when browning the meat, changed the cream of celery soup to another cream of mushroom(that is what I had on hand), and I have no idea how much tater tots I used because I had a huge bag from Sam's Club and so I just covered the top.  I didn't stir the tots into it so they were still crunchy which we all loved the texture.

This is a great base recipe. I made a few tweaks to the original. I added chopped onion to the ground beef and seasoned them really well with kosher salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I also layered in a bag of mixed frozen veggies and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery. I skipped the can of condensed cream to have a thicker sauce. You also don't need to thaw the tater tots beforehand. With an hour cook time they'll be plenty hot when they come out. My super picky husband loved this dish and had three helpings. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this receipe was ok. Fortunately, My kids love tater tots and LOVED this recipe. I added fresh green beans and shredded monterey cheese. The onion cooked in the ground beef definitely makes a big difference.

Easy and Excellent!!  I used ground turkey cooked with chopped onion, added chopped garlic (from the jar - 1 tsp), used seasoned tater tots, and sprinkled french fried onions over meat before adding tater tots and liquid mixture.  Ate with frozen peas and family loved it!

I thought this was a decent basic recipe for Tater Tot Casserole but I enhanced a little.  I seasoned my hamburger with a chopped onion, pepper and salt.  Instead of cream of celery, I do cheddar cheese soup.  Instead of milk, I do 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also include 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese.  I then combine my hamburger, soups, sour cream, 1/3 of my cheese and add seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I put my tater tots on the bottom of a greased 13x9 pan and put 1/3 of the cheese over the tater tots and then layer my beef mixture and put the remaining 1/3 cheese on top.  I bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hr or until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned on top.

Like others before me suggested, I cooked the hamburger first, used cream of chicken instead of celery and put one cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the meat/soup mixture before adding tater tots to the top.  The biggest addition I made to this recipe is that I used a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the meat and soup mixture to give all the flavor we needed!  We really enjoyed it.

this recipe was okay. I added onion,celery,can of green beans and some shredded carrot to the meat mixture. I think it was still too much potatoe. I think next time I will add less amount of tater tots and more cheese on top.

It was edible which is the best thing I can really say about this.  The flavor wasn't bad but I did not like the texture, really it was a mess of beef and soup topped with cheese and soggy tots. Dont know what I expected with the recipe but it was more than I got.

the reviews are wrong. You don't have to cook the meat 1st. Also I added another 1/2lb. of ground beef and a can of cream of chicken. Extra garlic is always good, and tons of shredded cheese on top about 10 minutes before its done. Very versatile recipe. I add Chili beans under the tots.

This is a really good recipe; however, I added cheese and a bit more garlic powder than what it called for. I would also suggest adding onion as the other users have said. Also, the tots do not need to be thawed - mine were not and turned out just fine.

This recipe sounds weird, almost gross, but it was delicious! I made a few adjustments as I combined the recipe w/another found. In a round glass pie dish, I mixed 1 lb ground turkey with salt, pepper, grated onion, dash of onion soup mix. Topped that with frozen corn, 1/2 can mushroom soup,shredded cheddar and then the tater tots.  I never grew up on casseroles, neither has my husband and we can't believe how good it was!

I made the following changes:  Browned the meat on the stove first and added two cloves of garlic (omitted the garlic powder); stirred 1/2 tsp of dried onions into the soup mixture (would have sauteed fresh onion with the beef but I didn't have any); mixed some frozen green beans into the soup mixture (eyeballed the amount); layered meat first, then soup mixture, then 1 cup of sharp cheddar, and then the tater tots and garlic powder; I baked for 30 minutes and then topped with some French's French Fried onions and baked for about 15 more minutes (until the onions started to turn darken).  WOW -- I was surprised at how good it was!  I expected it to be really "cheap" tasting, but it tasted pretty awesome.  My boyfriend was in heaven (he loves tater tots) and I was totally impressed.  I will definitely make this again.  Best of all, it was SO easy!

I've been making this for years - it's my comfort food! I usually use two cans of cream of mushroom though and a can of drained green beans. Easy, filling, you get all the food groups - what else could you ask for?

Very tasty. I did add a can of corn ('cause I really like corn). For the size of the pan (9x13), the soup just made a thin layer over the tater tots so next time I'll add an extra mushroom soup and also put the tater tots on top  instead of the bottom. I like the tater tots to be a crunchy. I think the tater tots absorbed a lot of the soup and the whole thing was a little dry. This can be fixed with another can of soup. As far as the taste.... it's five stars for me.

Really satisfying comfort food dinner! Couple of changes...didn't have the two cans of soup as I thought I did, so in addition to the one can of cream of chicken soup I had on hand, I improvised and added a can of cream corn. Actually, it gave the dish a nice added flavor! Also, I accidentally put the tots on before the cheese, but it worked out great anyway. Will definitely make again!

I made two 9x13 casseroles with the changes to the recipe.  This was an excellent base recipe.   We love veggies and did not want to have to serve any sides with this. So  I ended up using the following:  1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground turkey (both lean).  Cooked and drained.   I added the following veggies finely chopped, and sauteed (may look like a lot but veggies cook down quite a bit):  1 1/2 lb fresh spinach, 2 bunches green onions, 16 oz broccoli slaw, 16 oz fresh cauliflower, 2 green bell peppers, parsley, cilantro.  Mixed meat and veggies together seasoned with cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, tiny bit of salt *even using the healthy request lower sodium soups it does have a lot of soduim already; as do the tots.   

For the soupy mixture I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery and 3 cups milk, added handful of cheese.  Layered bottom with sparse amount of tots, put meat/veggie mixure, poured some of the soupy mixture; covered with 2nd layer of sparse amount of tots, then put rest of soupy mixture on top.   Baked at 375 for 40 minutes; added handful of cheese to the top, baked another 10 minutes.   

The tots end up soaking up the soupy mixture, as did the meat/veggies.  I did not have enough of the cream of whatever cans to follow the recipe exactly, that's why I increased the amount of milk. Also had to be sparse on the tots since I only had one bag.  So incredibly delicious.

Can I give this 6 stars ???? Wow this was good !!! I made a few changes and I know that's annoying when people do that but even without the changes I don't see how this could've been bad. Here's what I did: I cooked a pound of ground beef and layered it in a 9x13, then sprinkled with garlic and pepper (I had already salted while cooking), then I added I can each low fat cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, layered chopped green onions, shredded fat free cheddar cheese, and then tatertots and sprinkled them with salt and garlic, then  added a thin layer  of cheese and green onions on top. I cooked at 375 for 1 hr. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that the cheese on top came our kind of crunchy instead of melty and I think that's due to the type of cheese I used. Maybe next time I won't use the fat free cheese on top.... and there will be a next time!!!! :)

Our tweaks were Montreal steak spice (along with garlic powder) on the beef, and cheddar cheese soup.  My wife got home wanting comfort food and this fixed her right up.  :)

I agree with browning the hamburger meat as well. You have new cooks looking at this recipe and they wouldn't have known to brown the hamburger meat. This is the first time I've ever made this and I had no clue that you should have browned the meat first. You need to be more precise if your going to post recipes on the Internet. No Bueno

Good recipe, here is what i changed up and my three boys like it.

1. Brown 75-80% lean ground beef in pan along with 1-3 cloves of crushed garlic (I use about 2 Tablespoons of pre-crushed squeeze garlic) - We love garlic! add a pinch of pepper.

2. once brown, add 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup (10oz or about that size).

3. add about 1tsp of Worchester sauce, 2tsp of Heinz Ketchup, 1/4 cup of milk, 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar (or Mexican blend)  we like Sargento because it is real :), stir everything.

4. add about 1-2 cups of frozen corn or other veggies, we like corn because it is not green :)

5. put it all in a 9x13 pan layer on tater tots

6. I convection bake for 25 minutes at 400-425

7. take it out and add a layer of cheese then put back in oven for 2-4 minutes to late the cheese melt and form a layer (1-2 cups of cheese

8. Let cool on counter for a 5-15 then serve.  we like Garlic toast to go with it.

Family Staple!!! My sons favorite dish! You can use chopped chicken instead of beef, or even sage sausage (especially at breakfast). Yummy no matter how you cook it!

I added fresh mushrooms and about a teaspoon of minced (in the jar) garlic to my meat and onion.  I think it can do without the cheese to save calories.   I used a 8x10 casserole dish and used about 1/3 of a bag of tots.  Oh and i added a layer of frozen peas.  This is a very good comfort food kind of meal!

I combined this and another recipe and it turned out great. All I did was add one small bag of frozen mixed vegetables, 3/4 cup shredded cheese and leftover meatloaf.  It was filling, tasty and different.

I really like this recipe for its ease. I also appreciate that it can be changed easily. I like to add garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and a little bit of cumin to the ground beef while I'm browning it. I also add cheese and a mix of veggies. We've also done it with turkey or chicken, using broccoli and carrots for the veggies....very good!

I have made a version of this recipe for years.  My kids and I love it although my husband is not a fan.  The only change I make is that I cook the casserole and when the tater tots look almost completely done I take out the casserole, layer with sliced cheese and cook approximately 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.  It is super delicious!

I like this recipe. It's versatile and easy. Do brown the meat before baking. My own variation to this recipe includes switching the mushroom soup for celery soup (I'm not a fan of shrooms at all) and adding 8 oz light sour cream for some tang along with the garlic powder. I also salt and pepper the meat while browning it for some additional spice. You could add a pinch of onion powder, too, if you wanted. I think next time I'll add some vegetables to the mix.

I usually read the reviews before making anything, but today I didnt. It crossed my mind to brown the meat first but I thought since it doesnt say too in the recipe-then I would be fine, It actually came out just right. I used turkey meat instead and a used alot of garlic powder and added onions, oh i also put cheddar cheese on top. The tater tots are kinda soggy. not as crunchy as i would of liked, but i will make this again!

The recipe is by far my famlies favorite recipe for tater tot casserole! Even my picky husband loves it. The garlic is a wonderful touch. The meat does not need to be browned first as it would get over cooked. Perfect! Will make again and again!

I give it 5 stars after tweaking it. I did what another reviewer suggested. I browned the hamburger, spiced it, and spread on the bottom of 9x13 pan. I mixed together a can of cream of chcken soup, cream of mushroom soup, and 1 1/4 cups of skim milk..I spread this evenly over the hamburger. I then spread a small to medium bag of mixed veggies thawed (corn, carrots, green beans) over the soup mixture. A full 8 oz bag of cheddar cheese next, then top with enough tater tots to cover.
I baked for 55 minutes uncovered. It was soooo good. I even took a picture to post!

OMG, this is great! once it was all cooked and on my plate, i just mixed it all around to blend the flavors together. it was awesome. we added frozen peas and just 2 cans of cream of chicken. no milk. covered the meat with cheese, then tater tots then covered that with cheese. when i was eating it and loving it, i just thought, "you know what this needs?!?!? HOT SAUCE!!!!" i was right. it was even more awesome. thanks for the quick, easy, delicious recipe.

I fixed this recipe as it was written except that I didn't have any can milk so I used 2%. Although it didn't say to cook the hamburger & drain, I think that is obvious. I don't like to alter a recipe until I try the original. Anyway, It was excellent. Everyone said,"That's a Keeper." Thank You!!!

With a few changes, this recipe was so good. I browned the burger first with onions, used skim evaporated milk and low fat cream of mushroom soup, and added French cut green beans (drained) and shredded cheese on the top. I baked it for only 25 minutes and put the cheese on for the last 5 minutes. My picky husband thought it was "awesome". Also, if you use store brands of all the ingredients, it's a very cheap meal to make and makes a lot.

The family really enjoyed this one.  Husband had 3rds.  I added an additional can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also pre-cooked the hamburger in frying pan and added seasoning.  This was so simple and easy to make.  The only other change I will make next time is add some more tater tots to the top of the dish as my kids like some crunchy tter tots as well as the soft ones that were on top of the meat.  Thanks for sharing this recipe it's a keeper.

This tasted good to me but I think it was an odd combination. My husband said it was "OK" but nothing special.

This recipe was great and even my casserole-phobic husband liked it. I used regular milk and it turned out fine. I also added some cheddar cheese on top. Good stuff!

I gave it 5 stars because I think it's a great dish and anytime I have made it everyone loved it.  

I was making this long before it was posted to this site.  Most of the reviews are several years old and I don't know if and when people check the reviews.  I just had some comments to make.  Any recipe that you try should always be adaptable for your family.  The ingredients in this recipe are just that and you should always season to your familys tastes.   It only calls for a pinch of garlic powder.  This makes a lot for no more seasoning than a little garlic powder and salt and pepper.  I have gotten used to using onion and garlic powder since my husband doesn't like onion.  I have to slip it in anytime I can and if he can't see it he doesn't know it's there.  I have always cooked the meat before combining the ingredients.  I also usually use more than one pound of ground meat since you are putting it in a 9X13 dish that isn't a lot of meat.  It is much better if you season the meat but not with salt.  I noticed someone commented on saltiness and I had that problem and learned to use the low sodium soups and WATCH the cheese because that adds salt also.  You may want to try different kinds of cheese if you have a problem with saltiness.

When I put it together I put the cooked, seasoned meat on the bottom and top that with some frozen mixed vegetables cover that with the soups mixed with the milk and sprinkle some cheese over the soup.  Add the tater tots on top and I usual

Hmm....after reading several different recipes for this dish I'm beginning to wonder if the trailer park where my momma done raised me up was located in a parallel universe because we always added the meat to the pan raw (after combining it with dry french onion soup mix). In fact that's how I still make it. It always forms this wonderful/frightening solid sheet of more or less boiled meat that serves as a sturdy foundation for the more wobbly parts of the dish. And at 375 F I've never had a problem with the meat not getting cooked in under an hour.  I know that any foodie would become apoplectic at the idea of not browning meat, but hey, it's a freaking casserole!

I used ground chicken and a can of condensed cream of cheddar soup and a can of cream of mushroom. That's what I had on hand so it's what I used. Came out very yummy. I added my own roasted garlic seasoning to the meat and I cooked it before putting it in the pan and adding the tater tots  to it . I also a couple of handfuls of sharp cheddar cheese to the mix of meat and soups.

I made many of the adjustments mentioned in the reviews with tremendous success.  

While eating the yummy goodness, one review I read came to mind over and over again, this person continued to find the dish exceedingly salty, even after many adjustments.  My family realized the tator tots themselves could be the culprit.  We don't eat them often so I think our palates are a bit more sensitive to their salt factor.  Not sure how to remedy this other than try different brands of tator tots and cut back the salt all round.

Really though, this is a fine recipe.  Our son even asked to have some for breakfast.

I brown 1 1/2lbs of ground beef with an onion in a dutch oven. Drain. Add ground beef and onions back to dutch oven. Stir in 1 can of Beefy Mushroom soup and 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup. Mix it well with the ground beef. Add a layer of grated parm, a layer of shredded cheese (your choice) and top with tater tots. I set the oven to the temp for tater tots on bag. Bakes in 25 to 30 minutes. Quite tasty.

It was awesome! Mixed everything in the skillet with the cooked ground venison and then added 1/2 cup mild cheddar to the mix and after baked for only 20 minutes, adding more mild cheddar on top for 3 minutes until melted. Yum!

I just made this for the first time but have always loved tater tot casserole. At first when I poured the sauce over it didn't seem like there was a whole lot and also the meat didn't fully cover the bottom like on the sides but I think in the end it was fine. I put green beans in mine but might try it with peas next time, didn't care too much for green beans in it. Also if I would have been more prepared I would have sprinkled more cheese on top as I only had a little left I think it would have made it better. I didn't leave it in for the full hour but probably should have, I think the tater tots would taste better if they were more crispy.   I love this recipe though it's easy to make and doesn't take long at all!

I have made this recipe a number of times.  I agree with other reviewers that it is a little bland but I notch up the garlic (I LOVE garlic) add onion and yes I brown the meat first.  I use ground turkey and low fat cream of mushroom and chicken soup and just fill one of the cans with skim milk to add to the mix. My husband, who has issues with spicy and tomato based food really likes this one. I thought of putting veggies in the dish as others have done but I think I like it with a veggie on the side.

Because this recipe is on the bland side, I can see this being very kid friendly, but for our tastes I needed to punch this up. I took the advice from others by adding onion, lots more seasonings, green beans, cheese and even fried onions. And yes, I did indeed brown the meat. Still I found the dish to be just fair at best, however, it was eaten so I've no complaints. Thank you!

I added a few more seasonings,browned the meat first and added cheese. I got mixed reviews from my family.One person added ketchup and the other just ate it. But I thought it was ok. probably wont make it again but it was easy and worth a try>>>

My families favorite dish. Cheap, easy, and delicious. Many different ways to jazz up. But this recipe is perfect. Great dish that both kids and adults will ask for more. Good reheated as well.

Very impressed...fast and good. Did not have cream of celery so I used cream of chicken, and seasoned my meat more heavily. My 5 year old liked the meat mixture but would not try a tot. He loves tots so I do nto know what his deal was. Yummy and fast!

This was ok.  I will make again, but will make some changes suggested by other users.  I made it mostly according to the recipe, but I browned the beef first and only cooked it for 30 mins ~ which wasn't enough.  It was still just warm.  I should have cooked it longer.

I followed the recipe and we liked the sauce but the tater tots were too soggy.  I will not make this again...not worth the calories.

I absolutley LOVED this, my 2 year old who is the pickiest eater EVER even liked it! After his first bit he said"mmmm ummy," which of course translates into yummy. Anyway, I did alter it just a little bit, after reading some of the other revies, I tood some of the other ideas, added in a few of my own, and it turned out absolutley delicious. I added a small red onion, browned the ground beef, added some taco seasoning, much more than a pinch of garlic, ground cumin, and chili powder (with the fresh diced onion). I put shredded chedder cheese in with the soup mixture. And instead of putting the beef on the bottom, I put the tot's on the bottom, they came out a little crispier that way, and added some more cheddar cheese on the top the last 15 minutes in the oven. TRY IT, I THINK YOU JUST MIGHT LIKE IT!

I wanted to hate this, I mean who puts tater tots in a recipe?!?  It sounded so far-fetched I *had* to try it and I am so glad I did!  (My husband is still picking on me...)  Have now tried it a few times, all with good results, this is hard to screw up.  This last time though I added two small cans of green chilies, a can of corn and a teaspoon of cumin as I browned the ground turkey.  I used a can of cream of onion soup and another of cream of poblano.  Covered it in some cheese and some brand name taters tots and baked for 60 minutes.  I was informed by my husband that this was now on regular rotation and I was never to fix it any other way.  Wouldn't be so hard if the cream of poblano wasn't so hard to find.  I've used store brand tots and had problems each time so I stick to a recognized brand now...

Mine is quite simple. I use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. And, I use a half a can of peas. I prepare the tater tots in the oven, brown the meat in the stove. I always season the tater tots - helps add flavor without it being overwhelming. I've never used milk. The meat mixture makes a really great home made pot pie, too. I'm definitely going to try the chopped onion next time.

Tasty and easy classic recipe. Brings me back to the 1970's! I made this as the recipe stated. Next time I make this I might add some onions and or celery. I love these recipes that you can monkey  around with.  This is wonderful as written.

I always brown the meat first, and back the tater tots first. Then add meat, tatertots and soup mixture. I use a mix of cheddar cheese soup and broccoli cheese soup. This is great for a simple, weeknight meal. Nothin' gourmet. :)

i did not like this.  it was not bland at all, quite opposite, it was way too creamy and rich.  if i do make this again i can fix it by adding can of green beans and can of corn and top the casserole with crispy onions, then use only 1/2 can of cream of mushroom.

My husband and I thought this was delicious! I subbed cream of chicken for the soup, and used ground turkey instead of beef. I added chopped onion and seasoned the meat while cooking - and also added some shredded cheese. So easy, and so good! (Use seasoned tater tots if you can find them.)

I absolutely love this casserole.  What a way to make a quick all in one meal.  The taste is awesome.  I did add more cheese though.

This is not how tatot tot casserole should taste. I made it twice following exact directions, second time I made it I added cheese. It's way to plan.
