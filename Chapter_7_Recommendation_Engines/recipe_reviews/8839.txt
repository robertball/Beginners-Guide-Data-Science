THIS IS A STANDARD RECIPE IN MY HOUSE THAT IS WONDERFUL!!  But here is how I make it:
I wrap provolone cheese in the chicken in place of the cream cheese,
I sprinkle onion powder on top of the cheese in place of the chives
I use cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken (I just like the mushroom better)
I use 1/2 cup sour cream instead of mayo (don't like mayo AT ALL)
I bake the chicken breasts with a few raw slices of bacon, but like some of the other comments, I pre-cook the bacon really crumbly and then I sprinkle it over the top of the chicken
I add a little more milk to the sauce to make more sauce
Definitely serve with egg noodles. 

MAKE THIS!! MAKE THIS!!  It's so very good.  These are just some things I have done that make this recipe most versatile!

Given the reviews by those who thought this dish was bland, I made a few adjustments and the result, in my opinion, was just spectacular. Along with the fresh chives, I also added fresh basil, parsley, and minced garlic to the cream cheese. Before rolling up the chicken, which I sprinkled with salt and pepper, I layered a few fresh baby spinach leaves on top of the now herbed cream cheese. As others did, I partially cooked the bacon. As for the sauce, I eliminated the lemon juice, substituted white wine for 1/4 cup of the milk, and added some sauteed fresh mushrooms. The chicken was fabulous-tender with a burst of flavor and color from the herbed cream cheese and fresh spinach. The sauce was rich and creamy, the wine giving a depth of flavor to what might have been a bland sauce otherwise. Before serving I sprinkled it with some chopped, fresh parsley to give it a little color and served it with mushroom risotto. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

FABulous!!!  I prepared this for my husband for Valentine's Day and served it with a baked potato.  I had no chives, so I substituted finely chopped onion, and we don't eat mayo, so whipped up a quick and easy home-made mayo recipe (not bad).  I used two bacon strips per serving and pre-cooked the bacon-wrapped chicken for about 20 minutes, then added the sauce.  This is my new favorite dish. My husband is difficult to impress food-wise, and rarely makes unsolicited comments.  If he doesn't like it, he doesn't eat it; it's edible if he clears his plate; he really likes it if he goes for seconds.  He actually said it was very good, quizzed me about how it was made, and went for seconds.  I made it again for our anniversary, and had to defend my own plate!  Culinary success!!!

This recipe was amazing.  It has a wonderful table presentation and really doesn't take that much to prepare.  I did change a few things, just because I was in an inventive mood. I did use sour cream instead of the mayo.  I also browned the chicken for a bit so that it would not have too cook as long.  Added some garlic to the sauce (love the stuff).  I omitted the chives...forgot about them actually.  The biggest change was that I used pancetta instead of regular bacon.  I love the taste and it made this already rich dish seem like gourmet food that would cost a pretty penny in a resaurant.  Amazing Anna...thank you.

I was told:  This is a keeper!!  Please follow the advice of other reviewers and pre-cook your bacon until brown and flexible.  Otherwise, you will be left with RAW BACON Wrapped Chicken.  I served it over egg noodles also.  Very rich, very filling, very tasty!  You have got to try this recipe!

Very good. My daughter made it for the family. The only thing I would have done differently was to pre-cook the bacon.

This was so easy to make and really didn't take long! I substituded the chives with minced onion and I precooked the bacon just a little bit and since I used 6 chicken breasts I used a can of cream of chicken and cream of celery. I made eggnoodles and placed the chicken on top, drizzled it with the sauce and had greenbeans on the side! It was so delicous and my husband and boys loved it!

The wife came home from work, and I had these made. She loved them, so did the kids. Very filling, and the sauce goes great on mashed potatos, too. Takes a bit of prep time, but the results are worth it. I used minced onion instead of the chives. I made 2 batches one with the cream cheese and one with mozzerella. They both dissapeared quickly.

My husband and I did not care for this.  He did not like the chicken and I did not like the sauce.  I do agree that cooking the bacon before bacon is a good idea.

This is a really good and quick meal that even kids will love!  I have been making it for a while, but I use a tub of cream cheese with onion & chive.  That is what was called for in the original recipe I used.  Try it!  The chive goes great with bacon and it's really mild but adds a nice touch!

I made this and I was very pleased with the results it was excellent. My husband loved it and I will definitely be using this again for a weekend treat. Bacon wrapped chicken isn't supposed to have crispy bacon! Possibly negative results were because people are probably using cheap streaky bacon - use back bacon and trim off the fat and it comes out perfect. This isn't a low fat recipe and doesn't claim to be!

pretty good, but definitely precook the bacon before wrapping, not till it's hard and crumbly, but enough. This pairs really well with a mashed potato recipe you can use the left over bacon with. Fry diced onion in bacon grease, make mashed potatoes mix in fried onions, crumbled bacon, and cheese. Yum!

Used cream of mushroom soup instead and put fresh mushrooms into bake with this which turned out great.  Please cook the bacon first. There was no way I was going to use raw bacon - what a greasy mess that would be!

This was delicious but just a tad bland even with adding extra spices.  I made the recipe as is except I used cream cheese with chives already in it, added more chives, added parsley, oregano and some italian seasoning.  I cooked the bacon to almost completely cooked but still pliable and wrapped two strips around the rolled up chicken.  Instead of cream of chicken, I used cream of chicken with mushrooms and it was delicious!  I served with peas and chicken pasta.  When making next time I may just add red pepper flakes to give it some zing.

UPDATE:  This is one of our favorite recipes!!  I still add a little cream cheese but now use provolone, also.  I add Emeril's Chicken Rub, Garlic Powder, Italian Seasonings and sprinkle of cayenne along with the chives.  Mmmmmm  I make the sauce the same as in my last review but double it and serve it as a gravy for mashed potatoes!

I have made this dish for about 2 years, as a matter of fact I found it on this website. I use mozzarella cheese and precook the bacon first. I cook some rice and serve the chicken with the rice. I like the rice better than the noodles and also always use fresh lemon juice it makes a difference.

I made this last night for a small dinner party.I did pre-cook the bacon, but not enough: at 325 the bacon will never crisp up, especially covered with sauce.  Next time I will cook the bacon till it is almost crisp and wrap the ckicken.  Also, I did cook the breasts for 25 minutes first without the sauce, then put the sauce around and over the chicken, but leaving the bacon part of the breast uncovered. I used Golden Mushroom soup, wwhich helped the sauce get a nice golden color. Didn't have chives so I used a combo of cream cheese, fresh mozzaerrlella cheese and some green onion. And added some garlic salt.  Served with Giada's Pasta Primavera from Food Network.  Very good

I used to make this sans the sauce and just used cream cheese with chives and wrapped with bacon and it was always popular.. can't wait to try the sauce!

So good, but with some modifications.  - We used sour cream instead of mayo - Precooked the bacon until it was brown, but still flexible - Wrapped each breast in two strips of bacon - Broke up 2 extra pieces bacon into "bits" for the sauce - Used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic for the sauce.  I think I pulled every change out of the reviews I read and used them, but my goodness, this was yummy.

I took the easy way with this recipe.  I followed the ingredient list exactly & simply threw everything in the crockpot on high.  And I do mean I threw eveything in, no pounding or rolling of the chicken. (I did par-cook the bacon) Then walked away for a few hours.  When I came back I had a great entree.  I served it over pasta and my whole family loved it.  Later that evening when I asked my husband what he wanted for dinner the next night, he said he didn't care but that he hoped that it was as good as this recipe was.  I will be making this again.  Thanks Anna.

Husband LOVED, LOVED LOVED this! I also thought it was great.  I made changes to our liking though...
wrapped a slice of provolone around chicken instead of adding cream cheese.  Omited the chives, used sour cream instead of mayo, increased the amount of milk to make more sauce for the noodles.  I also added grated parmasean, garlic and onion powder to the sauce.  I pre cooked the bacon, maybe about 7-8 minutes until it was cooked but not crisp and was still pliable.   I wrapped the cheese around each chicken breast and then wrapped a slice of bacon and secured with a toothpick.  I made sure to try and not pour too much sauce over the bacon so that it would crisp up as it baked.  The final dish came out AWESOME!!!  Served over multi grain pasta.  Caught my husband sopping up sauce from the pan with bread after we ate!  This is a great recipe and I will be making it often!

This was amazing! I made very minor changes like I did not have a whole 1/2 cup milk so i made up the difference with heavy cream and I cooked the bacon a little before baking and i seasoned the chicken with some extra garlic and onion powder along with the salt and pepper. I also took the suggestions of adding a slice of provolone with the cream cheese.  The sauce is to die for and so simple. Chicken was a little work but after the first bite it was totally worth it! Served over bow tie pasta since i did not have any egg noodles. This will be on the weekly menue.

I made this exactly as the recipe dictates, and my whole family loved it!  Immediately after we finished the meal, my son told me I had to make it again soon!    In my opinion, the recipe works as is, but if you want the bacon to crisp, you will have to par-cook it first, or it will remain soft when baked in the oven (especially because it is topped with sauce.)

My kids gave this an 8 out of 10.  My kids are on the picky eaters side so if they give it an 8 I consider it a hit!  I did ad some more spices onto of the cream cheese (garlic powder, salt & pepper) and I sprikled the top of the chicken with some italian bread crumbs.

THIS WAS AMAZING! I literally just ate this, and I absolutely loved it. I followed someone else's review and pre-cooked the bacon. I added garlic roasted red peppers.  I will definitely make this again. Maybe next time I will use flavored cream cheese and maybe add another slice of bacon. Absolute favorite.

My husband and family loved it!!! the first time I made it I didn't have chives, so I used white onion and added peas. I left the sauce.  This time I stuffed with mushrooms and used herb and garlic cream cheese, as well as my onion again. I also used condenced cream of mushroom soup. I DID NOT pre cook my bacon, Instead at the end I BROILED ON HIGH for 5 minutes then flipped it over and repeated.  I also wrap the ENTIRE rolled up chicken breast in bacon so none of my ingredients on the inside could escape

My husband LOVED this!  I made it as  directed, but also added about 1/4 c cream cheese, 1/4 c  sour cream, 1/4 c shredded parmesean cheese to the sauce.  As well as a few dashes of each: garlic salt, cavender's, & parsley   followed reviews and pre-cooked bacon. For the filling I used cream cheese and shredded mozzarella with Dash of garlic powder & cavender's.  Served with Rigatoni noodles.  This was a 5 star dinner!!! KEEPER!!!

I followed the advice of others and cooked the bacon before baking, added sour cream instead of mayo, and I put sharp cheddar instead of cream cheese in a few.  LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT!  Just as a personal preference I liked the cheddar better.  Served it with some brown rice and spinach salad and it was the best, most romantic meal I've ever had with my husband.

The sauce has great flavor.I butterfly the chicken and spread the cream cheese to cover the entire breast.Completely cover the breast with prosciutto instead of bacon (about 2-3 slices each). These can then be cut into 1"-1 1/2" slices for a better yeild at parties.Thanks..

This recipe is so yummy!  I followed the advice of others and instead of wrapping the bacon around the chicken, I cooked 8 slices of bacon and crumbled it over the chicken.  Instead of pounding the chicken thin, I just made a pocket in the chicken and stuffed it that way.  I then used toothpicks to secure the stuffing.  I also used cream of mush. with roasted garlic soup, sour cream intead of mayo., and 2/3 cup of milk.  This is so rich and creamy!  It tasted like something you would order in a restaurant!  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!!  Thank you for the delicious recipe!

This was delicious. I loved the cream cheese with the chicken. I did however change the recipe so it would be done quicker. I didn't flatten the chicken. Instead I browned it in a skillet while I mixed the sauce. Then I topped the chicken with the cream cheese, bacon, green onions and topped it with the sauce. I then baked it for about 30 mins. In all I only spent about 45 mins instead of the original 1 1/2 hours.

I cooked this for myself and my husband last night.  My husband who normally isn't an enthusiastic person, raved about it.  I didn't have lemon juice and I added sherry instead.  I would agree that slightly browning the bacon would help, though I used very thin bacon that cooked completely but wasn't too crispy.  We are the atkins diet and it was very satisfying and delicious with 0 carbs.

The way I made this, it turned out excellently, but I did follow the advice of others and make some changes.  I'm not a huge fan of mayo, so I used sour cream instead.  I also browned the bacon first and crumbled it over the cheese before pouring on the sauce.  We left out the onion entirely by accident, but I don't think it really needed it.  I was worried about the cream cheese, but we actually REALLY liked it.  I served the extra sauce over instant mashed potatoes.  We'll definitely make this again.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt I had to make significant changes.

Replace the cream cheese filling with another cheese and it will be wonderful.  I am the queen of cooking with cream cheese and I couldnt even handle the filling.  The sauce and presentation was wonderful, but you really need to replace with cheddar or mozz, or maybe one of those cheese blends.

The college kids were leaving that night and no one could agree on a restaurant.  Somehow I had a bacon/chicken search on Allrecipes, and this one came up.  I had nearly everything on hand, and really appreciated the review comments, and incorporated a lot of them.  I precooked the bacon and had to substitute cream of celery for cream of chicken (so I added some chicken bouillon granules), I added a tiny bit of vermouth in addition to the lemon juice, and some herbs (Mrs. Dash table blend, and fresh basil) to the cream cheese, no chives, so I added some chopped onion.  
They inhaled it.  Every. Single. Bit. Of. It.

This was great! My picky daughter even said she liked it. I substituted garlic and herb mayo (kraft) because that is what i had and I thought it would add a nice flavor to the sauce...also used mozzarella cheese instead of cream cheese because it was what I had on hand...I too cooked the bacon before and and made a little extra bacon to crumble on top. Used some onion powder because I didn't have chives. Served it with egg noodles and a side of steamed asparagus. I know its not supposed to be a "light" dish but i used healthy request cream of chicken soup, skim milk, and the mayo was low fat. Was thinking one could probably use nonfat plain yogurt in place of the mayo as well. This at least puts a dent in the fat content :) Thanks Anna! I will definitely make it again, was a winner in my house!

This was good, but I had to re-cook the chicken because the bacon was raw...next time I will pre-cook the bacon, at least somewhat.  Also, instead of using chives, I just used chive and onion cream cheese...and I also used sour cream instead of mayonnaise (personal preference...don't like mayo).

I simply cheated by using Philadelphia cream cheese spread chive and onion instead. Cut some the prep work and tasted very good.

This is amazing when your looking for some good comfort food you want to try. I didnt have chive seasoning or fresh ones, so I used the cream cheese with chives instead. My husband loved it as much as me, so I will be making this again! :)

It was just ok, it was a split half liked it and the other not so much.  I think if the bacon were able to get crispy it would have been better.

Made this recipe exactly as outlined and the entire family was licking their plates clean!  The only suggestion would be as others have said, pre-cook the bacon and crumble it on top, rather than wrapping it.  I enjoyed it wrapped, but a couple of the family said they would have preferred it the other way.  Great recipe!

Mmmmm!  No leftovers.  I doubled the chicken and bacon, but not the sauce.  Had plenty to serve with brown rice.  After wrapping the chicken with the bacon, I put it under the broiler until the bacon was partially cooked,then poured the sauce around the chicken, not over it.  It was wonderful.

A great recipe that the whole family loves!  The only change I made was adding a little garlic powder to the cream cheese as others have suggested.  I recommend securing the ends of the chicken with toothpicks to prevent the filling from coming out.  Definitely serve over egg noodles.

NUMMY! We love this one! Being lazy, I just used the chive and onion cream cheese instead of separate chives. Also, I pre-cooked the bacon a bit - otherwise turned out a bit 'un-done' on the bottom. The sauce is perfect! I made this for my mother in law and she's made it several times for guests. Thanks for submitting!!

My first try at this recipe.. I changed a few things. I kept the cream cheese inside, but added onion powder, ground pepper, and parsley, and omitted fresh chives (the store was out). I used pepper bacon, and I browned it before wrapping. I used sour cream instead of mayo for the sauce. Although I completely forgot to add the cream of chicken, I did add crumbled bacon to the sauce and it came out SPECTACULAR! Very yummy! I served it with green beans tossed with butter and dried cranberries. Next time, I think I will try using gouda for the filling and serving it over pasta, and I'll remember the condensed soup. I'll let you know how it goes.  :)

SOOO GOOD! I was totally wowed by this dish!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but made a few changes. This recipe as written just has far too many calories and grams of fat so I used 98% fat free cream of chicken and 2% milk in place of the full fat stuff.  I fried the bacon until just done and then placed it over the rolled chicken. I didn't need to secure the chicken or the bacon with toothpicks, I just placed the chicken seam side down and made sure not to jostle it too much once the bacon was in place. I poured the sauce around the chicken and spooned it over and popped it in to bake. It was so good and I was pleasantly surprised to find the cream cheese was still in place when I cut it open. Yum.

I thought this dish was just wonderful!  I used cream cheese with chive already in it and did like others and baked the chicken 20 minutes before pouring the sauce over it.  For the sauce I used half mayo and half sour cream, next time I will add chive to this also.  I left out the lemon juice.  Would pre-cook bacon before hand, or omit it all together...

HUGE Hit im my house!! I used thin sliced boneless skinless chicken breast so I did not have to pound as much.  I also eyeball most mesurements so I may add a bit more than is called for or can pull back a pinch on the things I don't like.  Also did bake for 15 min with no sauce then for 60 with it.

This was an absolutely great dish!  The cream cheese center just oozes out when you cut into the chicken.  The sauce was great also!  I spruced it up a bit by using cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and used sour cream instead of mayo.  I also added some more of the chopped green onion to the sauce along with some garlic.  At the last few minutes of cooking I added a mexican cheese blend to melt over the chicken.  This is definately a keeper!

Ok, here is my lengthy review: First of all, my dish turned out absolutely gorgeous, much prettier than the picture :) Secondly, we thought that these were a bit bland and just too rich for our taste. I should have used reduced fat cream cheese. We used two slices of bacon per breast, which I pre-cooked for one minute in the microwave. I wish I had lined my pan with foil as the dish is soaking now. I think that this needs more spicing up, at a minimum some garlic. I didn't think that this was too salty, however, I used healthy request soup which has reduced sodium. I don't think I will make this exact recipe again, but might tweak it and remake something similar. Thank you for the post.

I bought precooked bacon and wrapped 2-3 slices around each breast.  I served the chicken/sauce over egg noodles and it was a hit! A++

Good recipe, but it is a bit rich.  I would also cook the bacon a  bit before wrapping it.  It just wasn't crispy, and it was fatty.   Otherwise it is a great recipe.

This is a good recipe.  I read the other reviews and decided to take thier advice and pre-cook the bacon.  But do not cook the bacon through so that it is crisy, otherwise, you cannot wrap the chicken with it.  There were two substitutions.  I used turkey bacon for wrapping the outsides of the chicken, and cream cheese that had chives in it already (Philadephia Onions and Chives).  I was very pleased with the flavor, and so was my fiance. There's a lot of sauce left over, so I would suggest making a side of mashed potatoes and using the leftover sauce as a gravy for them.  I'll be making this again in the future, but maybe be adventurous and try another cream cheese with different flavoring, like veggie cream cheese.

This was okay.  I think it would have been better with a different typr of filling in the chicken.  We're going to try some cheddar and mushrooms.  I'll let you know.:-)  But the sauce was great!!  I precooked the bacon a bit and used sour cream insted of mayo, and seved it over noodles (sauce on the noodles was wonderful!!)  But other than this filling this was great.  Thanks for the recipe!
***Updated***
3/27/02 (tried second time) SOOOO much better,  replace cream cheese with a bit of mozzerella and some chopped mushrooms.  Also sauted some mushrooms (with butter and garlic powder) and after cooking add them and some more cheese (about 1/2 cup) to the sauce and seaved the sauce over pasta.  YUMMY!

I tried this recipe for a new taste. It was quite good, although really rich. Instead of rolling the chicken around the cream cheese, I slit the chicken and then filled it. I will use sour cream next time in the sauce as well.

I enjoyed the chicken, however I have 2 family members that are lactose intolerant.  I put an extra 1/2 piece of bacon inside with the fresh chives, and used Tofutti Sour Cream Supreme in place of the mayo.  I doubled up on the sauce as other members mentioned and spooned it over the rice I served.

I didn't care for this recipe at all, but my girlfriend absolutely loved it.  So to be fair I give it 3 stars.  I thought the sauce had a bit too much of a mayo twang that kind of threw the dish off.

Tried this recipe last night. I used cream of mushroom and sour cream per one of the user's suggestions and I also added fresh string beans to the sauce. Over all, this recipe was very "eh". It was very bland, and I'm not quite sure to what to use to spice it up next time (If I decide to make it again?)

I love this recipe and so does everyone that eats at my house!  It is wonderful as is and is an excellent base recipe.  I have stuffed the chicken with spinach mixed with equal parts goat cheese and cream cheese.  It comes out wonderful anytime I make it whether it's as is or try something else with it.  Thanks Anna!

Delicious!  The bacon makes this dish taste amazing!  I crushed up a half a box of Stove Top Stuffing and poured over top of the chicken then drizzled four tablespoons of melted butter over the stuffing... My family could not get enough.

This chicken turned out amazing. I added smoked gouda to the cream cheese and also precooked the bacon. It was better than I thought it would be.I cooked it at 350 instead of 325.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I also did my own spin; replaced half the milk with white wine and the mayo with sour cream (as various commentators suggested).  I also made a rub out of salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and three different types of Old Bay (original, Blackened, and Garlic/Herb) that I put on the chicken.  I then put two slices of Pancetta sandwiched around a slice of Provolone cheese and topped with fresh spinach on the chicken before rolling it up and pinning it with the toothpick/bacon.  My friends could not get enough; easily the best dish I have ever cooked.

This chicken comes out so good and juicy. No need for the salt. Too much sodium in the cream of chicken. Use low sodium bacon and fat free cream cheese.

delicious!!! My family loved them. The lemon juice added a little zing that was perfect. i did make some changes gathered from others and my own experience. i used cream cheese and chive flavored cream cheese,1/2c sour cream instead of mayo, 1/2c white cooking wine instead of milk, and i used 1/2lb bacon cooked 4 slices and put them in the chicken instead of wrapping around it, crumbbled then cooked the rest (put aside). after rolling up chicken i coated them in a flour mixture (3T flour 1tsp peprika) and fried them till brown on all sides (turning frequently),then poured sauce mixture and crumbbled bacon on top, baked for 45min and served on top of egg noodles. PERFECT!

I made this recipe for dinner last night and it was a big hit. The few changes I made were:  I used chive and onion cream cheese for the filling.  Partially cooked the bacon cause it was extra thick and I added garlic powder, onion flakes and basil to the sauce to give it a little extra flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I warmed the cream cheese for 10 seconds in the microwave and mixed in the chives with 1 clove of garlic. After I wrapped the chicken in bacon I cooked it in in a sauce pan for about 15 minutes so all the sides had crispy bacon (it also removes some of the fat). I also exchanged the mayo with sour cream for the sauce. YUM!

This was sooo good and my whole family LOVED it. I did consider the other reviews and made 1/2 rolled up with cooked bacon, and the other 1/2 with bac crumbled on top. The bacon on top DID come out MUCH better! Over all, yummy...I will make this again! :)

I cook my bacon a little bit before cooking, also, I bake for about 15 minutes before adding the sauce. This ensures a crispier bacon. Instead of adding chives, I use chive flavored cream cheese.

This recipe was really good.  I cooked my bacon a little beforehand because I like mine a little crispier.  I omitted the chives due to personal preference and used sour cream instead of mayo for the sauce.  Some reviews said the chicken was a little bland so I rubbed it with garlic powder, salt and pepper beforehand.  I reserved some of the sauce so I could pour it over egg noodles that I served with the chicken.  I will make this again!

Everyone in my family loved this! I was in a rush and only used mushroom soup and milk. I precooked bacon as others suggested, pounded out breasts and folded in half, laying bacon inside and a few strips across the top and baked in soup/milk mixture. it was a HUGE HIT with everyone. Will be making this again for sure.

Absolutely wonderful. The whole family loved it. I used slices of cheese inside instead. I am wondering if anything melts inside the chicken no matter what you use?

This was good.  A little salty for my taste, but maybe I'll try again w/o salt and low salt bacon.  I also subbed sour cream for mayo.  Would like to try white wine in place of milk too.

Excellent and, more importantly, very easy!  Like the other posts, I precooked the bacon, used a chive flavoured cream cheese and substituted sour cream for mayo!  Delicious!

DELICOUS! I made this for my fiance for his birthday dinner and we both just LOVED it! i opted to use sour cream in lieu of the mayo and garlic & herb cream of mushroom in lieu of the cream of chicken as others had suggested.

My 11 year old son made this for Dinner! Easy and absolutely FABULOUS! A few alterations: Wrapped two slices of bacon around each instead of one. Used 2 cans of soup. Cooked and crumbled some bacon for the sauce. Served with wide  egg noodles.
This is a new rotation for us! Loved it!

We didn't have any chives and we only had cream of mushroom soup in the pantry so with that this was very yummy!  I ate it for dinner over egg noodles and the next 2 days for luch over elbos, no real preference, they were both excellent!

I will not be making this again! I thought the sauce tasted much to much like mayo. And I didn't think you could taste the bacon at all. The cream cheese senter was good but all together was just overwhelming. I do not recomend this recipe.

This recipe was amazing!  I just made a couple of small changes.  I pre-cooked the bacon about 90% ready in a frying pan before wrapping around the chicken.

And I stuffed the chicken with brie cheese instead of the cream cheese. It was amazing!  Served it over roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

My husband and I LOVED this!  I will be making it again...soon.  :)  

Based on other feedback that was posted I did the following:  I let the chicken soak in McCormick's Chipolte Pepper marinade while I precooked the bacon.  This marinade really spiced things up with a great flavor.  I butterflied each chicken breast, coated the inside with the marinade, added cream cheese the entire length, and a little fresh garlic (no chives), then I closed them up and placed them in the backing dish.  I broke up the bacon and covered the tops of the chicken with strips of it.  For the sauce I replaced the milk with white wine, used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, only used 1/4 cup mayonnaise, and did not add salt.

I would rate this a 6 if I could.  This was by far the best thing I've made so far from this web site, and my husband agrees.  It's not the healthiest meal out there, so it will be a special occasions dish.  It's better then most meals we've ordered out, and we're food snobs.  I paired it with some rice and fresh steamed broccoli, and the cheese sauce was awesome for dipping the broc into.  It was pretty rich, so you can use a small piece of chicken, and not the full amount of cream cheese.  The only thing I did different was use Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  That was used both to stuff the chicken, and in the sauce.  Also, I didn't have chives, so had to leave that out.  I can't say enough, how unbelievably gourmet good this was.  We both woke up this morning, and said again, how good dinner was last night.  That doesn't happen often.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!

Delicious! I sprinkled garlic inside the chicken, and used jack cheese in place of the cream cheese because I was out of it. I used half chipotle mayo and half sour cream for reg. mayo, my family likes the spice, I also added parmesean. I sprinkled with crumbled bacon and shredded cheddar. We had peas on the side, very tasty with the sauce. I will absolutely make tis again!

I tried this recipe again.  I increased the chicken to 6 breasts and combined cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  I added Italian dressing mix to the soup and put extra cream cheese on the chicken.  Outstanding!

Well…sorry but it wasn’t that great! The pieces were huge (even though I pounded the chicken) and didn’t look “inviting”. My guests ate it, I am sure, for courtesy! As some other reviews…the sauce is definitely I keeper…it was fantastic…maybe with another type of chicken…the chicken itself was incredible bland…oh! And for those worrying about the crispiness on the bacon…what I did after the 50 minutes baking was broil it for another 5 minutes and it came up crispy enough!

Don't know what I did but this was just ok for me. I think next time I'll buy the bacon that's already cooked and wrap that around my chicken. Not bad for a "date night" dinner when you want to impress your hubby though! He liked it.

I made this with chive and onion cream cheese and served it with acorn squash and green beans. Another time I served it with sour cream and chive scalloped potatoes. Not bad!

I added garlic and other spices to the cream cheese and the soup to make this less bland.  It's a great creamy dish and the family loved it.  I like my bacon crispy so next time I will not use thick cut bacon.  I may also bake for 15 - 20 mins before pouring the sauce over the chicken.

Made this meal for my family everyone loved it , I used the sourcream instead of mayo. I precooked 4 slices of bacon and crumbled up and mixed with the cream cheese. I also wrapped the chicken in bacon. I cooked the chicken 25 minutes then added a slice of american cheese on top of each breast and poured sauce over top. Everyone loved it but were unable to get seconds. I served with Mashed potatoes and broc.Used extra sauce as gravy.
Thanks for the recipe Ann. Will cook this for my friends.

Delicious dish! I served it over egg noodles. Regarding the bacon issue that's so prevalent in many of the reviews... there is NO NEED to pre-cook the bacon UNLESS you prefer your bacon crispy. Not pre-cooking the bacon does, obviously, result in chewy bacon. If you don't like chewy bacon, pre-cook. If you do like chewy bacon (and I do), then don't worry about pre-cooking. The bacon isn't going to be "raw" like one reviewer said. Trust me, 1 hour in a 325 degree oven is going to fully cook your bacon.

Great fast family dinner recipe.  Even easier:  Put frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs in single layer in baking pan.  Place some cream cheese on each piece of chicken.  Pull apart bacon, using just meaty parts, and lay on top.  Continue with recipe as directed.

this was very good, and easy too!  didn't have chives on hand, so i substituted minced onion. i used thin sliced chicken cutlets, spread the cream cheese on top and laid cooked bacon strips across (didn't roll chicken up), then poured the sauce on the whole thing....came out great!

I used previous reviews suggestions to also "tweek" this recipe. For "stuffing:": I cooked bacon first and crumbled in with cheese mixture.  I used reduced fat garlic and herb cream cheese, I added 1 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder and added 1/2 c chopped ham.  For Sauce: I used lite mayo, and omitted the lemon juice.  My family loved this recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I love the aroma the sauce and the bacon give off while baking!  I did do a few things different, I cooked and chopped the bacon, mixed the chives with the cream cheese and sliced the chicken down the middle and stuffed it with the bacon and cheese!  Also a good side, broccoli with melted cheese and a baked potato!

This sauce is so good, you could drink it. I didn't bother wrapping my chicken with bacon, instead, I just cut the bacon up into little pieces, cooked it until it wasn't limp, and then I added it over the chicken and baked. This was a perfect, great, and wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe last weekend. I followed the directions, but pre-cooked the bacon only because I like it well done. I put the bacon (crumbled) inside with the cream cheese. When I asked my husband if he would like it again he said "Yes & Soon!" We both really enjoyed it! It is rich tasting like someone said, but you know that when you select this recipe.
DELICIOUS!!! YUMMY!!!

WOW!  This recipe was really good.  Even my very picky 6 year old at it and asked for more!  I used Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic instead of cream of chicken also increase milk to approx 2/3 of a cup.  Also used Turkey Bacon...what awesome flavor.  My husband is not big on mayo....he didn't even know it was in there!  Have been asked to make it again and again!  Very easy to make.  Recommend you try this one.

Lots of opinions with this recipe! To cream cheese or not to cream cheese, mayo vs. sour cream and to pre-cook the bacon or not! I chose to use the mayo because the sauce is the same one I use in one of my chicken broccoli casseroles and I think it's delicious. My kids don't like mayo, but they don't even know it's in there. Everyone has their version of what "cooked" bacon is. To me, it's brown and crispy, so I precooked mine. I don't see how bacon could become crispy smothered in the sauce. I used chive and onion cream cheese and then jazzed it up with more herbs and seasonings. I knew the dish was going to be rich, but once in a while, it's not going to hurt and the fat in the recipe can certainly be reduced. Personally, I loved the cream cheese filling, but my family decided that they would have preferred another type of cheese. This was a nice dish Anna. No leftovers either!

Oh My Gosh.  This is absolutely delicious.  So easy to make and fabulous.  Some reviewers said you needed to partially cook the bacon - no need - all you need to do is leave the bacon at room temperature for an hour and it wraps beautifully.  This is a great dish for company.  Very hearty.

Very good recipe.  I also cooked the bacon slightly.  I also served the sauce over rice since I was out of pasta.  I think the sauce would also be good on mashed potatoes.  Thanks!

It passed with DH and I.  Subsituted sliced mozzerela instead of cream cheese and used lowfat soup and added noodles.  My only complaint is that it is really rich.  Tasty, but rich.  Next time I'll probably leave out the cheese all together and try it with just the bacon wrapped around it.

Ugh. I was so excited about this recipie, and had planned it for my traditional Sunday night meal with my boyfriend. We just finished and I'm still hungry because I could not eat this recipie at all. I had three bites. The sauce was much too rich and thick. And are we supposed to be able to eat the bacon? We sure couldn't. It was still limp and raw looking. Overall this was a huge waste of good ingredients and I am very displeased. It's a shame that I spent so much time today on something so rich that no one can eat it.

I have cooked this twice now.  The 1st time I made it with cream of chicken, 2 spoons of mayo, and mozzarella cheese instead of cream cheese.  We just didnt like the cream of chicken and it had an overpowering taste of mayo.  So I made it again with cream of mushroom and lemon pepper on top and only 1 spoon of mayo and boy did that make a difference!  I will make it again after tweaking the recipe.  I also cooked the bacon until it was brown and flexible. Thank you M

KIDS LOVED IT (BECAUSE OF THE BACON!)  I COOKED THE BACON A LITTLE BEFORE WRAPPING THE CHICKEN AND HAD TO USE CREAM OF MUSHROOM (JUST AS GOOD, I'M SURE).  I ALSO USED SOUR CREAM INSTEAD OF MAYO.  MINE WAS DONE IN ONLY 50 MIN.  THIS WAS SO GREAT!  MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS IMPRESSED AND JUST LOVED IT!

I have tried it with the sour cream and found it to be a nice change.  I also use the reduced fat cream of chix soup and that worked well too.  Cooking the bacon is a nice idea, and I will try it the next time I make this dish.  I have been making it regularly for a long time now, and it has always been a fave here at our house- even for my mother who can be somewhat picky.  She will sometimes request this if she is coming over for dinner!  A hit and a nice change of pace!

This is amazing! Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the bacon, and that's personal preference. Good combination of flavors but next time I'll pre-cook the bacon a bit to make it a little crunchier. Cooking it in the sauce gives you soft bacon. After tasting the sauce I also added about a Tbs of dijon mustard and that gave it the kick it needed.

Amazing!  I just pre-baked bacon half way, baked in the oven only 30-40 min at 325, then hit broil for 10 minutes, to get nice crispy bacon!
For my husbands, I added jalapeno pepper, he loved it so much he took a picture!~ Great work Anna !

I give this three stars because the recipe needed a LOT of changes, essentially making it something new altogether. Here are the changes I made (and some I wish I did). First, I pre-cooked the bacon as suggested. Next, I peppered the chicken before rolling it. Then, I added garlic powder with the chives.  For the sauce, I omitted the lemon juice, used 1/4 instead of 1/2c mayo, added 1/4 c of sour cream, and seasoned the sauce with pepper. I also added in yellow onion that I diced and cooked in a tablespoon of the bacon grease. I did not add any salt to the sauce. And it STILL tasted a little salty. In retrospect, I would have used low sodium condensed cream of chicken soup, and maybe would have used a half a can of that, and a half a can of cream of celery. As for the cooking, it took longer than an hour, and I never got a dark top. In the future, I would cook it at 350 instead. I would also make it in a smaller pan.

Amazing recipe.  Like most other reviewers I modified.  I added garlic powder, finely chopped onion and crumbles bacon to the inner cream cheese filling.  I also increased the lemon juice to 2 tsp in the sauce. Doing so added a great deal of flavor. My entirely too-picky food connoisseur friend loved it and demanded the recipe.  This recipe is for the WIN!

I have made something similar to this before and have to say it is sooo good!! I used the new flavored Italian herbed cream cheese spread instead of using the ingredients used to make the cream cheese filling. Saves a lot of time and is very good. I also pre-cooked my bacon slightly in the microwave. Very good recipe. Thank you!

I have made this recipe many times using both the directions as written and substituting due to lack of ingredients or a taste for something different that day.  It is really hard to mess this up!  It has never failed to please family or friends, many of whom ask for it constantly!

I cooked this last night for my family EXACTLY like the recipe and they absolutely LOVED it!!  I fixed it with baked potatoes and we were so stuffed and miserable afterwards.  No one could finish their plates.  I will fix this next time with light veggies so we can actually finish it all.  I used two slices of bacon on each checken and it was fantastic!!

This was fabulous! I made it the night before my party. I assembled it, poured the sauce over it and stuck it in the refrigerator covered in plastic wrap. The next day I baked it for the one hour then I had to go to Sunday service so I loosely placed tin foil over it and left it in the oven at 175 degrees.  Two hours later I took it out of the oven for my guests and it was perfect. FYI, I added one teaspoon of dried thyme to the sauce, salt and peppered the chicken before rolling it, par cooked the bacon, and sprinkled it with paprika before baking. You will need at least four teaspoons of chive, not one teaspoon as stated in the recipe.

Awesome recipe! It was definitely a hit. Next time, I will probably cut the cream of chicken mixture in half. I felt like the flavors were dampened by the sauce. I also agree that partially cooking the bacon was definitely the way to go. And I only had chicken thighs on hand, which worked just fine and I didn't have to pound the chicken as it was already thinner than breast meat. Overall, a great recipe! We will definitely have it again!!

Wow! This dish was very good. I added a little bit of garlic powder, used sour cream in place of mayo (don't like mayo) and used cream cheese with chive. Yum! My hubby stuffed himself and kept raving about this dish. Did brown the bacon first which made it that much yummier. Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious! My husband loved it. 
I did make a couple of changes though. I cut a pocket in the chicken breasts, seasoned the inside, and pushed the slices of cream cheese inside. I didn't have chives on hand. I used thick cut bacon, and wrapped each breast with two slices, and secured with toothpicks. I then browned them in a skillet until the bacon was nice and crispy. I knew if I just put them in the oven without browning first the bacon would be mush…yuck! I cut down on the mayo and milk as well. 
Delicious, and a definite keeper!

Wow, super rich! So if that is what you are looking for this is it. My husband loved it. However, the rest of us could not manage to eat it! I switched the recipe up a bit due to lack of time. I just wrap the chicken breast in bacon, mixed up the cream cheese with the rest of the sauce ingredients, & added garlic & basil, poured it over the chicken and baked in 1hr @ 350.  Would make again for my Love! =)

Wow!! This was awesome! I followed other reviews and pre cooked the bacon before I wrapped it. Also, After pouring the sauce on the chicken I sprinkled crumbled bacon and more fresh chives on top! My boyfriend and his  4 year old son LOVED it! Bf even said it tasted and looked like something from a restaurant. (The chives and bacon on top gave it nice color) I made with egg noodles and peas!! MMMM!!!

Woo hooo!!!!!  This was spectacular!!!!  Everyone loved it.  I butterflied the chicken and used onion and chive cream cheese since it is a little to early for fresh chives.  I wish I had made a double batch.  I will add noodles on my plate next time to soak up more of the awesome sauce!!!

I made this exactly as written.  It came out edible.  However, if you don't like limp bacon, then don't wrap it around the chicken.  If you feel like you need the bacon flavor, cook and crumble the bacon and sprinkle on top when baking.  As for the sauce, I'd probably switch sour cream for the mayo.  I served it over fettuccini and it made for a nice meal.  But for me, this recipe made as written was not anything to repeat.

AMAZING!!!  We followed some other reviews and cooked the bacon before hand, we also wrapped 2 strips per breast instead of 1.  The amount of cream cheese could be halved to save money and fat content.  We would absolutly make it again!  Great if you're having guests over, they'll think you're an amazing chef.

Follow other's advice and precook bacon.  My husband said it lacked any one bold flavor.  I agree.  Too many calories for a so-so meal.

Family totally loved this one, and that is saying something for my crew. I did precook the bacon. I used Provolone cheese inside the chicken instead of cream cheese...thought the kids would like that better. No chives. But, I am sure it would be great with them...again, thinking of kids, I left it out. Served over egg noodles. Its a keeper.

This is absolutely delish! Although I have never made the full recipe, it is one of my favorites. I leave out the cream sauce and serve as a finger food with tooth picks. Thanks for the great recipe! This chicken is the best!!

This is good, but I actually prefer mine without the soup mixture.  I've made it the with just the cream cheese and bacon before, and like it that way.... but the addition of the fresh chives is something I'll definitely keep doing.

How awful! I made this for the family and followed the directions exactly, including some of the suggestions from others. It was absolutely terrible. The chicken became rubbery, the cheese on the inside was dry and lacking of flavor and the gravy clumped up and looked unappetizing. I wouldn't try this again.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I've been making it for several years, and as of yet have never had anyone NOT like it!  My biggest fans, a few years ago, were some in-mates (from our County jail)... I'm a District Court Clerk - we needed some in-mates to do some work for us, and out of appreciation I brought them some of these for lunch.  I received umpteen 'thank you' letters raving about how good they were, and a couple requests for the recipe to send to their wife(s)! :-) I sometimes use sour cream in lieu of mayo for a slight taste-change, and I always sprinkle garlic powder on (with the chives) as we're huge garlic-lovers!

My husband and kids loved this!  My youngest is a picky eater, and he chowed down his dinner.  Definitely a keeper, and I recommend that everyone try this one!

This is a new favorite at my house! I also add some chopped green onion to the filling along with the chives. I use a few more slices of bacon for each piece of chicken (we're just begging for a heart attack around here...) and do precook it, until mostly cooked but still flexible enough to wrap around the chicken. I make extra sauce and serve with egg noodles and mixed vegetables. Faaan-tabulous!

This was very good and I'll definitely make it again. I don't think it cooked long enough though because the sause was lumpy,not sure if that was normal. My chicken looked done enough...

This meal seems like it has good potential but by following the recipe I found it to be vary bland.  The only alteration I did was to put a bit of chopped red pepper in it but it wasn't enough.  I think I will try it again but I will try to spice it up a bit.

LOVED IT LOVED IT! this recipe is very easy to do. I did do what the other reviews said and took the mayo out and added in low fat sour cream. I also read that it did not have much flavor so i spread crushed garlic on the inside of the chicken and sprinkled with onion salt before adding the cream cheese and chives. I also pre baked the bacon till almost done. I also did skim milk and for the noodles i used whole wheat.Turned out great. the sauce is very thick and tastefull and the chicken was very moist. A very quick and cheap to make. Kids loved it.

I made this for the first time tonight, I added paprika, garlic to the cream cheese mixture. When I made the sauce to go over the chicken I used what was left of the filling, It was AMAZING. Do agree that the bacon needs to be half way cooked before u wrap the chicken

Great!  I did not read the reviews prior to making since I was in a hurry, so I prepared the dish exactly as the recipe called for.  It was great!  My husband and our guests just loved it!  I will in the future pre-cook the bacon as I can see how that would help with not having such "floppy" bacon, but other than that it was perfect!!

This recipe was amazing. I was a bit skeptical at first about the cream sauce but it was fantastic and goes well with jasmine rice. Heavy for sure. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe but maybe be a little more generous with the salt/pepper rub, maybe add fresh garlic too. You do not need to pre-cook the bacon. I actually didn't read that recommendation until after I cooked the dish. The recipe says to pour the sauce over the chicken but i just placed it around it and very lightly drizzled it over the chicken careful to not hit too much of the bacon and it cooked perfect (a little rare on the bottom side but I was okay with that).   Will definitely cook this again :)

Absolutely wonderful!By mistake, I opened cream of mushroom soup, kept full amount of sauce for only two of us, Added minced garlic to cream cheese slice. As another suggested, I added a few torn spinach leaves, wine for milk, , then some dried parsley to the sauce. We have it over fettucini with sauteed spinach. Thanks so much..we are having this often!

Very good recipe, especially with the added spices that others recommended.  In addition to some garlic and onion powder, I used the wine and the sour cream and it was wonderful.

This recipe was a lot of work for a poor result.  I had to bake it for almost 2 hours to get the bacon cooked AFTER I removed it from the sauce and put it on a separate baking dish.  It had a good taste overall, but it was quite an endeavor for something that seemed relatively simple.  I am glad it was successful for others.

This is a recipe I will make again. My boyfriend and I loved it! I'm amazed I got him to eat mayonnaise and cream cheese because he "hates" them. This was so easy to make and it came out perfect. I did leave out the fresh chives, because I didn't have any. Very tasty!

Delicious!!!!! I accidentally grabbed a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic instead of regular, but I think it might actually have been better that way.  Also, I used two strips of bacon(slightly pre-cooked)for each piece of chicken. Yumyum!

This was a good recipe. I also made the few suggestive changes. I used sour cream and provolone cheese as substitutes. I also put 1 slice of bacon inside each of the chicken breasts prior to rolling and then sprinkled the top of the mixture with additional pieces of crumbled bacon. Served with egg noodles and poured the sauce over the egg noodles upon serving. This was an excellent dish!

Delicious! I followed other users' suggestions and just butterflied the chicken breasts instead of pounding them out and rolling up the cream cheese.  I also used sour cream instead of mayo - I'm scared to put MAYO in a sauce!  Maybe I just need some encouragement.  :)  I also herbed the cream cheese by adding some dried oregano, dried parsley & dried minced garlic.  If you herb the cream cheese, don't add any more salt - the bacon is plenty salty!

An excellent recipe.  I opted to stuff the chicken with cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon, then coat it with the cheddar/pretzel FlipSides crackers, then wrap it in a bacon strip.  My family ate it up.  ^_~

This recipe was AMAZING! Based on other users reviews, I also precooked the bacon before wrapping it around the chicken which made it awesome! I also added the chives along with some fresh garlic, black pepper, and a dash of onion powder to the cream cheese a few hours before making. Instead of using plain old cream of chicken soup I used the cream of chicken with herbs and crumbled in some leftover bacon and the sauce turned out delicious. Served over rice and the kids ate it all up! I think I found my new Holiday staple! Thank you!!

Excellent recipe! I modified it by using the reviews from luvjezuz & naples34102.I cut the chicken breasts in half flat ways because they were too thick to roll. I pre cooked the bacon just a bit.I used cream cheese sliced thin on each piece of chicken w parsley, crushed garlic, oregano,pepper & diced green onion. I used the cream of celery soup and substituted the milk for 1/2 cup white wine and also eliminated the lemon juice.I also used a full small container of sour cream instead of 1/2 cup of mayo. Baked it in the oven 350 for 1 hr uncovered and it was absolutely delicious!! Served with broad noodles and garlic toast.Would definately make again and again. Thanks Anna, luvjezuz and naples!

Wow Wow Wow, this dish is wonderful! I read other reviews and took some advice from others by pre-cooking the bacon about half-way done. Instead of milk, I used white wine, giving it more flavor. Instead of chives I used fresh cilantro...which gave it wonderful flavor. I love cilantro!  This is a dish I am excited to serve for guests!

Just made this for the family this weekend - we have a new family favorite. I made the following changes: Sour Cream instead of mayo, green onions instead of chives (store was all out) originally I had planned on flavoring it with some rosemary, but was thwarted by the store and settled on savory (added to the sauce.) Instead of flattening the chicken, I created a pocket in it, and stuffed it with a slice of provolone, wrapped around a slice of the cream cheese and some cut green onions. Then wrapped the whole chicken breast in two slices of prosciutto. Didn't need any wooden sticks or twine to hold it all together. The only other thing added was some lightly sauteed sweet and green onions to the sauce. It sounds like a lot of onions - and it was - but it didn't take anything away from the kitchen. 

I only wished I had remembered to marinate the chicken before hand.

Great rich and creamy recipe with lots of room to customize to your taste.  Like others, I prepared the bacon first, used sour cream instead of mayo, and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup. I've made this several times, and once I used swiss cheese instead cream chesse, which was also very good!

This is a good recipe for bacon wrapped chicken if you leave off the sauce. I used cream cheese with chives and baked without the sauce on top. Very good

This recipe has great potential.  The sauce is great, I LOVE cream cheese, so that part was great, too.  However, both my  husband and I felt that the chicken needed a little more seasoning...it was a little bland.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but I will spice up the chicken before I roll it up.

A definite keeper for our family!  Would consider partially cooking the bacon first next time or using pre-cooked slices.  But the flavor was awesome!

A family favorite! I make a few adjustments to this. I add freshly ground black pepper, minced garlic and fresh basil to the cream cheese cheese. I partially cooked the bacon. I substituted white wine for 1/4 cup of the milk.

Was delish! I precooked the bacon on the stove and drained the fat and pat dried it with paper towel.   I cut back on the milk a bit and replaced it with a little white wine.  Also added some grated parm cheese. Hubby loved it!

WOW!! I impressed myself with this one. My husband commented that it tasted like something you would order from a restaurant menu!  Easy and simple to make.  I followed the recipe as written, however I did cook the bacon in the microwave until ALMOST fully cooked, but pliable enough to wrap around the chicken.  Will definately make again.

This recipe was great...but I did give it my own spin.
I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and nufchatel cheese for the cream cheese.
I also made open faced sandwiches out of the recipe instead of just stuffed chicken breasts.  I cut the chicken into cubes and baked in the sauce mixture.  Then I toasted some asiago cheese bread and spread the nufchatel cheese on it.  I topped the bread with the chicken and sauce and pan-fried bacon.  YUM!  My husband raved!

I made this for eight friends and received a few compliments.  It was very good but not something I thought would be a staple for company or the "go to" chicken dish.  I agree that the bacon needs to be precooked a little but this is dependent upon your taste.  Some bacon wrapped dishes are not supposed to have crispy bacon but I felt this one would have been better for my taste if the bacon was crispier but this dish does have the comfort food taste we all enjoy....rich and yummy.

This recipe was fantastic.  I made it for my husband's birthday when we had our families over.  It has great flavor, is easy, and the presentation is wonderful.  I would definitely recommend frying up the bacon so they are cooked about halfway before wrapping the chicken in it.  I also cooked up a few extra pieces and threw it into the sauce to add a little extra flavor.

This was fantastic!!  My husband raved and can't wait to take the leftovers to work tomorrow to show off.  I used other user's advice and baked the chicken for 20 minutes prior to adding sauce, then baked for another 40.  I think this dried out the chicken a little so I would only pre-bake for 10 minutes next time and make sure the sauce coats the chicken.  I didn't have chives so used cream cheese sprinkled with italian seasoning, then added jalapenos to some and did some without.  Both were great.  Loved it!

This recipe is alot like a local Mexican restaurant's "White Wings"...except they put a jalepeno in the middle instead of the chives. Makes for a spicy bite! But very good! When I make this I add that jalepeno (:

This was incredibly well recieved by my family. It was extremely rich despite the fact that I used low fat ingredients. I did use onion and chive cream cheese, and sprinkled some garlic powder in the sauce. The extra sauce was great served over rice and peas. I will definitely be making this again, although my brother did ask that for the sake of our health that I not serve it too often!

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe with just one change, instead of chives I used green onion. It was outstanding. The second time I tried stuffing the chicken with ham and mozzerella, it was okay but not as good as the original recipe.

A keeper!  The only changes I made were to double the recipe, used green onions instead of chives, added dry tarragon leaves as well, cooked the bacon almost till done that was to be wrapped around, cooked more bacon all the way and crumbled it on the cream cheese before rolling them.    I was amazed that everyone liked it so much and only complaint I got was from my youngest  about "the green stuff" (picky kids!)but liked the taste otherwise.

This recipe was great!!!  I've made it   3 times this month.  My husband loves the sauce and it goes great with angel hair pasta.  I haven't tried pre vooking the bacon yet, maybe I will next time.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  I HIGHLY recomend this recipe to all.  Kudos to the author :)

As I was trying to pay too much attention to the suggestions in the reviews, I failed to add the cream of chicken soup, but did add some sour cream to the sauce.  The chicken still came out great according to the whole family.  My husband liked the chicken even more the next day! I will definitely make this one again.

We eat it 2 to 3 times a month, its great!  I use sour cream instead of mayonaise, the flavor is a little lighter then. I do  cook the bacon before hand, just enough so that it won't overcook in the oven. For the cream cheese I like the chive premixed.  Its very tasty.

The chicken did not turn out anywhere near as good as I was anticipating based on the reviews.  I did pre-cook the bacon as other reviewers suggested, and after cooking with the chicken and sauce, it was still not as crisp as I would have liked.  I am giving this four stars, because the sauce was super, I will use the sauce again, but not the bacon wrapped chicken.

Well my husband has a new favorite dinner.  This was really easy to make and everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was cut the chives (didn't have any) and mixed in dill.  I also used cream of chicken with herbs. Took advice and pre-cooked the bacon first.  Everything was very flavorful all blended well together.

I've had this in my recipe box for a while and just now tried.  It was Excellent!!  I usually try to stick to the exact recipe, but I did not have the chives to go with the cream cheese and I used maple flavored bacon instead of regular. I thought it was pretty easy and the tasted was wonderful!

Didn't care for the bacon, would probably wrap it in proscuitto or thinly sliced ham next time.  Sauce was good but bland.  Would spice it up a bit next time too.  I didn't even taste the filling so I either didn't use enough or it was because I used the cream cheese with chives as others suggested.  Would still make again, just with some revisions.

Very good flavor, served with fettucini and bread sticks.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper before pounding and then left the salt and pepper out of the sauce.  A little too time consuming to make very often, but may make again once in a while.

I though this recipe was good but I didn't care for the cream cheese filling.  Since my husband hates cream cheese I filled his with colby/jack cheese.  He said he LOVED it.

I made this recipe for my mother and I and she's very picky.  She ended up loving it and asked for the recipe.  I made a few changes by using colby jack cheese instead of cream cheese.  I also cooked the bacon first and crumbled it on top of the chicken and in the sauce.  Also, instead of pounding and rolling chicken I just created a pocket in the chicken breast and stuffed it that way.  Very Good! I will be making it again.

Wow! Just made this and was wonderful. The whole family loved the flavors. Used three pieces of bacon for each chicken breast and dried chives, everything else was the same. Made white rice as a side dish and spooned a little of the soup mixture over it. Will definitly make this again.

I LOVE this recipe!!! I made it for my little family and we loved it. The only thing I changed was I used Philly's Cream Cheese with Chives. Just saved me a small step. Thanks for sharing! Oh and I love to serve mine with rice. OH soo good!

I tried this recipe, and my whole family felt the sauce was too "mayonnaise" tasting. The next time I skipped the sauce altogether and just put the creme cheese on the chicken, rolled it up, wrapped the bacon around it, and baked according to the recipe. We liked it this way much better. Both my young kids loved it and ask for it often. I also used the creme cheese with chives in it (was all I had) and it came out great!

This recipe was so delicious.  I doubled the recipe, and the little bit we had of leftovers was gone the next day!  I didn't have a problem with the bacon being non-crispy, I thought that it was fine the way it was, and it really added to the flavor of the whole meal.  The cream cheese and chives in the middle was just a wonderful taste and texture to add to the tenderness of the chicken.  I made this with mashed potatoes, and green beans, and the cream of chicken mixture that was cooked over the chicken made a great gravy for the potatoes, and I think it would be wonderful served over rice as well.  This meal was absolutely wonderful, and I can't wait to make it again!

This chicken dish was a BIG hit with my whole family.  The only change I made was that I browned the bacon-wrapped rolls first, to get the bacon nice and crispy and to avoid having the bacon grease floating around in the sauce. It was yummy, and I'll definitely made it again.  Thank you Anna!

Very tasty dish! I halved the recipe and made a few adjustments and it was really good.
I added Cayenne Pepper to the sauce and instead of flatening the chicken breasts, I filleted the centers and added the cream cheese.  I then placed the cooked bacon on top of the cheese and fastened the sides of the chicken breast together with toothpicks. I cooked the chicken for 20 minutes at 350 degrees without the sauce added to the dish. After the 20 minutes, I added the sauce and continued cooking until bubbly.

I luved this recipe, but I did make a variation.  I am not a fan of the cream of soup sauces, so I substitued the cream of chicken soup for a cup of sour cream, and microwaved the bacon first for 2 minutes.  Very rich so it doesn't take much to fill you up!

This tasted good, but I would have cooked the bacon just a little bit. The bacon wasn't crispy. I also wrapped the chicken with 2 slices instead of one. I had ALOT of leftover sauce, so next time I wouldn't add that much mayo. My husband who is VERY picky enjoyed this recipe.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! Definitely not for people who count calories. My only suggestion would be to beat the cream cheese and chives and add some salt before putting it in the chicken. And, my bacon always cooks thoroughly.  LOVE IT!

This recipe was good but not great!  My kids told me I had better not even think of making this again.  My husband had seconds so I know he thought it was good, he never said it was great though.  I personally enjoyed it, but I will look for another recipe next time.

Sorry, I didnt like it. I tried using sour cream insteak of mayo, I pre cooked the bacon a litle and used Montery Jack cheese, I used dried chives (all I had) but I dont think anything couldve made this interesting. It was tasteless and wish I wouldve just used my usual stuffed chicken breast recipe.

Love it! My husband doesn't even like cream cheese and he really enjoyed it.  If you don't have any bacon around you can substitute it for sliced deli ham. I have done both bacon and ham.

The cream cheese filling really didn't add much flavor to the dish. Next time I would substitute Boursin cheese (or some other herb cheese) for the cream cheese. I would also add white wine to the sauce. I would also serve it over rice instead of wide egg noodles.

I did the modified version of this recipe with just a mix of cheddar and cream cheese in the center with the bacon wrap on the outside. So popular that I have had to give this recipe out many times to friends.

This recipe was an instant favorite.  Thanks Anna! I never even tried to make it with so much cream cheese.I knew it would be too rich for us.  I split 1 oz of cream cheese between the 4 chicken breasts and add different spices each time.  I've always used cream of mushroom soup and I think I'll try using sour cream instead of mayo next time.  At my family's request, I precook and crumble the bacon into the sauce now.  This is a must-try recipe.

Good.  Make sure to make mashed potatoes to use the gravy.  Mmmmmm.  Try adding sour cream instead of mayonaise.  Mmmmmm.

This recipe was very good!  To decrease the amount of fat, I used the following substitutions: turkey bacon, skim milk, fat-free mayo, fat-free cream cheese & Healthy Request Cream of Chicken Soup (Campbell's).  It was still very rich and tasty!

Try precooking the bacon, crumbling it, and putting it inside with the cream cheese.  Chicken stays plenty moist with just the sauce.  Great recipe!!!

I sprinkled a bit of sharp aged cheddar over it, paired it with the classic mashed potatoes, green beans and biscuits, and it was not only a great dish for company, but feel good food too. ;) Great recipe!

I made this to celebrate my husband's new job - great choice! 
I used cream of mushroom soup and put slices of fresh mushrooms in the cream cheese, and also cooked some whole ones in the sauce.  That paired with a shot of Hennesy (mixed in the sauce)made it a delightful celebration!

Very good.  Used Boursin cheese instead of regular cream cheese.  Also pre-cooked bacon and fried fresh mushrooms and onions in bacon grease.  Poured over chicken, then added sauce and cooked for 1 hour.  Delish!!  Great over rice!

The chicken was good, the sauce  was not my favorite. I did skip the mayo since I don’t like mayo, so that may have given it more flavor. I used some sour cream and a little Alfredo sauce in it instead, looking for something creamy to sub in. Mine was a little runnier than I wanted and not enough flavor. However since I liked the chicken and it was a slightly different spin for dinner, I will probably try again but add bacon drippings or crumbles to the sauce and maybe some cheese, or at least less liquid.

Absolutely delicious! Definitely will make this over & over. I took some advice here & there from others to add flavor. Definitely cook the bacon first so it doesn't come out raw. And season the cream cheese with chives, parsley, garlic powder & basil. Some steps that are missing that helped me were: if you're using a plump chicken breast like foster farms just cut it as if if you were unrolling it to make a large flat piece. No need to pound flat unless you want to get splattered with a juicy mess. Season the flat breast with salt & pepper. And use more than one strip of bacon or cut a wide strip in half. If not, that one piece will not even make one turn around the chicken breast after you stuff it. Other than that I followed the rest of the recipe. Enjoy!

Loved this. All I did differently is add more seasonings. More garlic, onion powder, pepper flakes, and added seeded and finely chopped fresh jalapeño to the cream cheese. Mixed it all up and spread it on the pounded out chicken. It was so tasty! Have made it twice now. Once with chicken breast and the second time with thighs. Fabulous both times. Served it over penne pasta and steamed broccoli. Yummo!

The taste of this recipe is phenomenal! The only thing I changed is cooking the bacon on the stove and crumbling it over top when the chicken is done baking. Wrapping the chicken in bacon you just don't get the same crisp, and I like my bacon crispy!

So good.  Only used three chicken breast halves, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same... Except for wrapping each breast with 2 strips of bacon instead of 1. And used green onion instead of chives because that's what I had. Also pulled them out of the sauce about 20 minutes or so before cooking time ended  to crisp up bacon.   Served on egg noodles. Thank you so much for sharing! Can't wait to make again.

I first made the dish to send to a bereaved family.  It looked so good that I made it for my family.  It was an instant success.  It may look time-consuming to assemble, but it really isn't.  Would definitely recommend it and will make it again.

I made this for the first time today, and it became an instant favorite. The kids even had thirds! I made it exactly as instructed and found that the bacon was cooked through and that the sauce was not a greasy mess, despite the cautions of other reviewers. The bacon was soft though and not crisp, but bacon-wrapped recipes are usually this way. The sauce was just amazing, and really absorbed the bacon flavor after simmering in the oven for an hour. I will definitely be making this again soon!

Like many reviewers, I used sour cream instead of mayo.  I used 1/2 the milk, no lemon juice, but did use white wine instead-- gave me an excuse to open a bottle!  My husband and teens are never too keen on me trying new recipes, but they liked it a lot.  If you put the sauce in the pan first and lay the chicken on top, the bacon on top gets crisp yet the chicken stays moist.

Good recipe that you try different items in it. I used provolone and swiss for the cream cheese added garlic and green onion before I rolled them. for the sauce I used cream of mushroom soup and heavy cream for instead of milk. just like other people said I precooked the bacon.

This was very enjoyable.  I par cooked my bacon a little too much so I made a casserole rather that wrapping it.  I put the cream cheese on the chicken and sprinkled with garlic salt.  I copped up some chives, basil , parsley and spinach and layered that on top of cream cheese.  Sprinkled some cheese on top of that.  I mixed up a can of cream of mushroom with some sour cream and layered that on top.  Sprinkled some more cheese and added the chopped up bacon. Bkaed it for 40 minutes and served it on top of some spinach and arugula.  Saving the calories of the egg noodles. Was really a good dinner.  Thank you for this recipe.

I have made this recipe in a similar fashion for over 40 years.  The bacon not being cooked, right, but the way I was told eons ago and still make this regularly is,  cream of mushroom, small container of sour cream, mixed together.  Boneless chicken breast, not flattened, lay a slice of NOT cooked bacon on whatever, put breast on top, pour soup/sour cream mixture on too,  bake uncovered 250 x 3 hours.  It is all in the length of baking and the bacon flavour permeates right through the chicken, delicious, and basting once in a while, no cheese.  No raw bacon

Great recipe! I changed up a few things for the flavor and time savings. Step 2.5 - Sear the wrapped chicken breast on all sides before moving on to step 3. This will add flavor from the browning of the chicken. It will also add flavor and crunch to the bacon! (I can't stand flabby bacon!). The searing also holds in the juices (and flavor!).

Since the chicken has now been precooked a bit, it won't take as long in the oven I put the oven on 350 (instead of 325) and the chicken only needed to cook for about 30 minutes. This will depend on how thick or thin you have pounded out the chicken.

I also made a larger batch. Instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I used a can of Healthy Choice cream of chicken chicken and a can of Healthy Choice cream of celery. Mix them up for variety! With the double batch I didn't double the mayo, instead I used 1/2 fat free mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream to lighten up. It was great! I also threw in some sauteed onions and yellow peppers.

I served my husbands over some brown rice for him and we both had carrots on the side.

It was fine and everyone ate it, but it wasn't as glorious as the reviews made it out to be. Made it exactly as written and served over egg noodles. Hubby says we could do it again but it isn't on the must do list. I was so excited about this one, too.  The bacon added a nice flavor to the chicken, but that's about it. Kind of bland.

It was good, not great. It actually tasted better the second day. I like sour cream instead of mayo in sauces. Add fresh portobello and garlic. Add spinach. Will add spinach at the beginning.

This was good, but it took much longer to cook than the directions indicated.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was great with a side of rice. I would've like it better if the bacon was a little crispy though.

I made this with a few minor alterations. I made the sauce with Golden Mushroom Soup instead and let me tell you that this was a FABULOUS alternative! I also added sliced almonds and red onions. My kids LOVED it. My dad said he felt like he was eating at a fancy restaurant! I am making this again for a party this weekend for 35 people. I am excited to prepare this dish tomorrow and then place it in the oven for cooking on Saturday. Definitely a must try with the Golden Mushroom Soup!

Excellent super easy recipe! Loved it, so did my 2 year old. I used Chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, and only made 3 of them. I also used Cream of Mushroom Soup instead of Cream of Chicken. And minced up fresh onion instead of the chives. Came out great, served it over some lemon herb rice.

This was a great dish.  I really liked it.  It looked pretty too.  This is definitely one to serve company.  The finished cooked chicken was a tad bit bland in my opinion.  Next time I think I will add a pinch of salt, pepper, and garlic on top of the cream cheese and chives before I wrap up the chicken.  I had some extra chives cut up, so I added them to the top of the chicken before I baked it.  Also threw some shredded mozzerella cheese on top too for good measure.   Next time I will also pre-cook the bacon a bit as others have recommended.  Bet that would be quite tasty.  Thanks much for the recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was very good. I didn't have any cream cheese or chives, so I substituted "herb and garlic Laughing Cow Cheese". I also pre-fried the bacon slices a little bit because I don't like rubbery bacon. It turned out nicely but next time I will add a little curry powder and paprika to the sauce to kick it up a bit.

I wasn't a big fan on this. I don't like mayo. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of onion and garlic powder. And I also cooked the bacon first and then sprinkled it on top. My husband really liked this. So if your a big fan on mayo most likely you'll like this too!!!!

I made this exactly as written and did not like it at all. sorry, but the sauce was just not a good flavor and ruined the chicken. I will continue just rolling the chicken breast around the cream cheese mix and rolling in breadcrumbs and baking.  thanks anyway, but I will not be using this recipe again.

The chicken was excellent and tasted great with noodles. HOWEVER, I would suggest NOT using mayo in the sauce. The mayo stood out too much and tasted like mayo covered noodles. Next time I will add wine and mushrooms to the sauce instead.

pretty good, I doctored it up a bit after reading reviews.  in the middle, salted and peppered it, and used minced onion instead of chives.  The sauce I used half mayo and half sourcream. Cooked the bacon a little ahead of time like most reviews suggested.  Probably will make this again.

This was pretty good, it has an interesting flavor.  Next time I make it, I won't wrap the bacon around the chicken...it doesn't cook up enough for me.  I will just cook and crumble the bacon into the sauce.  For the cream cheese, I used a flavored chive and onion cream cheese as a shortcut.

I've made this a few times and it's always good. Use onion and chive cream cheese and add a half cup of white wine. Don't worry about the sauce being thick before cooking, the juices from the chicken will thin it out. Perfect over rice, for noodles double the sauce. And don't use cheap cream of chicken.

My only alteration was to add a few shakes of lemon and herb seasoning into the chicken with the cream cheese and to omit the salt (I felt there was enough in the soup and cream cheese).  This one is a keeper.

This was soooo good! I added a bit more lemon juice than originally called for and used Miracle Whip instead of real mayo. The sauce tasted almost like hollandaise. Next time I think I'll try adding some chopped spinach to the filling.

SO delicious, we made this at home and my boyfriend raved about it for weeks. Although the chicken is not as tender and juicy as I normally like it, the flavor was fantastic... I would recommend this for any girl trying to impress a man for dinner! LOL!

This was my first recipe using mayonaisse and it turned out pretty well.  Reminds me of a similar recipe that I've made before but with a homemade cream sauce and it also had mushrooms.  I followed the recipe as stated expect I preseasoned my chicken (both sides) with garlic salt, parsley (since I didn't have chives), and pepper.  After mixing my sauce, I tasted and it was okay; however, after baking it, the bacon drippings completely changed the taste of the sauce which then came out GREAT!  Both me and the BF removed the bacon before eating our chicken--there was just a texture inconsitency that we didn't like (top portion was browned and crispier than the underside portion).  Served with parsely baby potatos and steamed green beans.

It was good, but very heavy on cream cheese...might be good with feta or something like that.  And like others were saying, the bacon does need to be pre-cooked.

I did fry the bacon a bit before wrapping the chicken as others suggested. Family raved about this new way to prepare the same 'ol chicken.

This was just okay.  The bacon was really chewy and rubbery.  I think if I were to make it again I would put the bacon wrapped chicken in the oven for a few minutes first to give the bacon a chance to crisp up a little before I added the sauce

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I'll definitely make it again, and I'm planning to make this the next time we have company.  I made the recipe as stated (but used the amounts as a guideline - I never measure), except I did add more chives than the recipe calls for, and I sprinkled salt and pepper directly on the chicken before I rolled it.  I like the idea someone else had about adding minced onions and spinach in the rolls.  I'll try that the next time.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I cheated and used cream cheese with chives, also stuck a handful of fresh baby spinach leaves.  Microwaved the bacon ahead of time so it was a little cooked already.  My breasts were pretty thin so they only needed 30 minutes at 350.  Very tasty!

This was excellent.  My whole family loved it.  The chicken was moist and sauce was perfect.  I did serve it over noodles.  I mixed the chives in with the cream cheese and salted and peppered the chicken breast before rolling.  After covering the chicken with the sauce, I sprinkled more chives and cooked bacon on top.  This recipe will be added to my rotation.  Thanks.

I am sorry to say that this was very bland.  I did prepare as stated and did not follow some recommendations to season it up.  I also would precook the bacon. Maybe cooking the sauce separately and then adding when served might be better too.  My children and husband seemed to like it and we served the leftovers on toast points which they liked as well as the pasta.

Overall pretty good.  The bacon did not get crispy though.  Maybe would be better to wait to add the sauce so the bacon could get crisp, or precook the bacon some.  Next time I want to try putting sun dried tomatoes inside instead of chives.

Made this last night for a couple of friends and my boyfriend. Absolutely delicious! I mixed the cream cheese with green onions (instead of chives) a bit of Mrs. Dash and oregano. Precooked the bacon a little bit, and a little bit of hot sauce to the sauce for a kick. Definitely will make this again

This recipe is so delicious, but unfortunately it's so greasy :(  I'd really appreciate it if someone could tell me, does pre-cooking the bacon help with the grease problem? I'd hate to miss out on this dish.

This turned out great! However, I used chicken tenderloins, turkey bacon, increased the temp to 375 and decreased the time to 30 minutes. The tenderloins are easier to handle, cook faster, and two of them still provide a filling adult portion. I also followed the advice of some other members, and eliminated the lemon juice and subbed 1/2 cup lite sour cream for the mayo. I also added 3-4oz of amber beer and flavored the sauce and chicken with salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend. I also used reduced fat cream of chicken soup and 1% milk to make a healthier meal. It went well with cheesy broccoli and skillet potatoes.

This dish was OK. I used chicken breast strips instead of full chicken breasts. They wrapped beautifully. My kids and I loved the noodles and sauce where as my husband loved the wrapped chicken. If I do it again I probably won't use so much lemon. It wasn't "incredible".

Although there is no way to make this "healthy", I did make the following substitutions with success.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, the healthy request soup and reduced fat mayo.  Also, as everyone else has stated the bacon needs to be cooked ahead of time.  I did not do this and after cooking ended up unwrapping the bacon and throwing it out.  Recipe still had plenty of bacon flavor.  Served over brown rice with steamed broccoli.

This was an awesome meal but, instead of using the cream cheese I used mozzerella and added onions to it also like some of the others did.  My kids loved this I will defineatly be making this again.

Very good. I did change it up a little by marinating the chicken for 3 hours before stuffing w/ the cream cheese.  I also substituted fat free sour cream for the mayo and Marsala wine for the milk.

Thanh loved it.  Broiled bacon 1st, wrapped each breast w/3 strips then chopped remaining and added on top.  Used Cream of Mushroom soup instead & cream cheese instead of mayo.  Added chives, salt, pepper before rolling.  A little rich for me but the sauce was Thanh's favorite.

I agree, cook the bacon before.  I half cooked it before and it still wasn't the texture that I wanted it at.  I would make this recipe again with just a few alterations.  It was pretty good!!

WOW!  I haven't made a chicken dish THIS good in a LONG time!!  We absolutely LOVED the flavors of the chicken, cream cheese, bacon and sauce all cooked together.  I followed the recommendation of naples and used half white wine/half milk and then extra spices/garlic with the cream cheese mixture.  Served on top of angel hair pasta and I already can't wait to make this again!  This would be an excellent dish to make for company!

I thought this recipes was good.  I didn't have all the ingredients for the sauce, so I used hollandaise instead which turned out well and was less runny than the picture.  I used some spices on the chicken based on other reviews.

This was very good! Of course the Italian in me added garlic, which you know makes everything better.  I also mixed the cream cheese & green onions together a bowl and then put it inside the chicken.  I think next time I will leave out the mayo& the milk, I don't think it needs it. This recipe will be made again for sure.

I changed this up a bit as well, I also used the cream of mushroom and sour cream instead of mayo and cream of chicken. I added some green chilis to the cream cheese (I used Neufchatel cheese)and it turned out delicious!

We liked it and it was easy to make. I added some onion soup mix to the sauce mix. The sauce was great, but the actual chicken breast was a little bland. I will definitely make it again!

This was very good, can't say I will make it weekly but it is good to add in every now and then.  I took suggestions of others in that I pounded flat, spread with garden veg. cream cheese, sprinkled with salt/pepper/poultry seaason/ and some spicy Mrs Dash (which added a kick and a lot of the flavor) then I rolled up, topped with a slice of pre-cooked bacon and topped with the soup mixture.  I used sour cream instead of mayo.  It did take longer to bake than it stated and I even turned the oven up half way through.  The chicken was tender/juicy.  the sauce was a bit thin for me and I cooked some noodles and added the sauce to them which was good, but the sauce didn't have much flavor because the spices were rolled up in the chicken.

I simplified this recipe by leaving out the cream cheese and chives (I was all out) and I used precooked bacon and chicken breast tenders which shortened the cooking time.  This dish still came out tasting great. I was looking for yet another quick and easy way to prepare chicken, and this was definitely a winner. I'm sure it would be good with the cream cheese, but as it was already pretty rich, I think it was best that I left out that step. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was a great recipe. My husband loved it. I did change it a little. added a couple of slices of fresh jalapenos inside also, as well as lotsa various seasonings. We like things SPICY! The "sauce" was too thin, but that's fixable. I served it with some cut up/diced roasted potatoes, mushrooms and onions for the side. Overall this was a great dish. I will make it again. Thank you :)

This was EXCELLENT.

I was a little concerned when I first created the sauce and was even cautious to pour it over the chicken but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised.  

I added the Provalone cheese instead of the cream cheese and it was wonderful.

This recipes was great, my family really enjoyed it.  I did agree with the other users and made a few changes. I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and added one clove minced garlic, Mrs. Dash, parsley, and ranch seasoning to cream cheese to taste. I substituted 3/4 c white wine and 1/4 c milk instead of 1/2 c milk. I also partially cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken. It was fantastic!

My wife and I had this the other night, and it is fantastic. Thanks for the recipe. I did pay attention to the other reviews, added Ms. Dash to the cream cheese and some minced garlic. I also used Poultry Seasoning to flavor the chicken. Finished it off by adding bacon pieces to the dish, instead of wrapping the chicken. WONDERFUL!

I used provolone instead of cream cheese and cooked the bacon before hand. It was really good. A nice change of pace. Probably wont be made again soon though, it was a tad bit bland.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I too created a "pocket" for the cream cheese. I didn't have Chives so I added some Mrs Dash seasoning mix to spice up the cream cheese.  I also added some minced onion and liberal amount of garlic salt/pepper. Very good and will make again.

My husband absolutely loved it. I think it turned out great, too, except that it was very rich and I couldn't eat very much. I substituted sour cream for mayo and cream of mushroom for cream of chicken. I don't think i would have liked this with mayo. I precooked the bacon, and also crumbled some fully cooked bacon in the center with the cream cheese. I used the chive flavored cream cheese. It turned out very nice looking - my husband and I both agreed that it would be good to cook when we have company over - looks great on the plate and a little goes a long way! There is a bit of prep time involved, but it's worth it. I served with fresh green beans.

Defintely 5* plus.  I skipped the pounding and rolling steps and chose instead to cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast to hold the cream cheese.  It was quick, easy and just as attractive. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing and I'm a very fussy cook. This dish is good enough for your best company and then some.

This makes a great prepare ahead dish for company.  Did not like the white sauce at all, has a strong mayo taste. I used a package Bearnaise sauce mix by Knorr, tasted wonderful on the chicken. I've made this 4 times and will be making it tonight for the family.

Very good flavor, followed the sauce directions, but only used two chicken breasts, no problem for me with the bacon being soft, I ate mine, hubby took it off, I think that the bacon is used in this recepie more for flavor and to help keep the chicken moist. Will make more next time for left overs. Yum!

I thought it tasted great but I only gave it 3 stars because it just sat in my stomach for hours - I ended up so sick and (pardon me) belching that taste for hours after. My hubby didn't like it at all and threw it out =(  Guess this one won't be in the rotation.

This was really good! The only change I made was based on some of the other reviews, that the bacon should be precooked. I put it in the microwave for a minute or two, then wrapped the chicken. Oh, and I didn't roll the breasts. Still great! VERY rich!

My boyfriend liked this recipe alot. I thought it was good but next time Im going to pound the chicken down real thin and fry the bacon. I used spinach with the cream cream instead of the chives. Im going to make this again with the new changes and see if I like it better. thx

Absolutely loved it! My husband couldn't believe I made it from scratch. I was out of mayo so I used sour cream. I had mashed potatoes as a side and used some of the sauce from the pan as a gravy and then topped the potatoes with bacon.  Great meal!

This recipe was very easy to prepare. More importantly, the end results were delicious. I did add one package of chopped mushrooms to the mix. It gave the dish an extra "umph" factor.

This was delicious! To make the bacon crispy, I cooked it in the microwave first for 2-3 minutes before wrapping it around the chicken.  I also added a dollop of sour cream and several pieces of cooked bacon to the sauce. Will make again!

Very, very good! My husband's only complaint -- "Can you add crispy bacon chunks to the sauce and maybe cut up the chicken next time?" I agree with the bacon, but the cream cheese filling was yummy!

This recipe is very rich & yummy. I skipped the pounding step and just butterflied the breasts. My hubby didn't like it but my very picky toddler did so I'll make it again. LOL. I slightly pre-ccoked the bacon but it didn't help so next time I will use a pan I can put under the broiler.

I don't know about everyone else, but my husband and I think this chicken tastes almost like chicken cordon bleu.  I used Italian seasoning in the cheese since I didn't have any chives on hand and it turned out delicious.

I made this recipe and did not care for it at all.  The chicken was dry even though it cooked in the soup, maybe because it was rolled up.  You couldn't taste the cream cheese at all.  Just NO flavor.

I thought this dish was fantastic! My teenage daughter did not agree but she wouldn't say why? I followed other reviewers advice and substituted the mayo for sour cream and used a herbed cream cheese. Will certainly make again!

This was a fussy recipe with the pounding and the wrapping and the tooth picks not to mention that I did  pre cook my bacon.  I am definately a lazy chef!  I thought the cream cheese was to much and maybe provolone would be better.   No fault of the recipe but my chicken was dry.

Fantastic-great creamy taste.  I do recommend to precook bacon/use cream cheese with chives already mixed in. I also added a can of drained mushrooms & some sour cream.  Will make again!!

i totally bombed this but it still tasted great. i was too lazy to pound the chicken, rolled it anyway and then forgot the bacon until i already put it in the oven. So i took it out and layered the bacon on top. didn't secure it with toothpicks either but WHO CARES! TASTED GREAT IF YOU CAN GET OVER IT'S BOMB SHELL APPEARENCE!

I made this just the way the receipe oredered, except for the lemon juice and toothpicks, didnt have any. I thought it was great, my only complaints are that the bacon did not taste great (next time will precook)and I couldn't really taste the sourcream. I think this would be better with cheese inside instead.

This was pretty good; a bit fiddly to make, but tasty. I followed others' advice, and microwaved the bacon for about 30 seconds to crisp it up a little. If I were to make it again, I would probably use the garlic and herb cream cheese - the filling was a little bit bland.

I love this recipe so much.  I have made it for my sons teacher at school for Teacher Appreciation week.  She loved it too.  I never add chives because I can never find them.  Tastes just as good without but I think I will try it with cream cheese and chive to see how that tastes.

Quick, EASY and delicious!  Followed the recipe the first time and it turned out perfect - next time I'll try to precook the bacon (prefer it crispy) and maybe try the herbed cream cheese idea, too! My husband gave this SIX stars! Yum!

My family loved this!! As with most others, I did cook the bacon slightly before wrapping around chicken.  Added a few more spices that are to the liking of my family.  My hubby usually doesn't care for anything in a "white sauce",, but really loved this one.  This will now be a regular on our menu.  Thanks

Wonderful dish, I think it had a lot of flavor!   I did pre-cook my bacon as I like it crisp & after reading another suggestion, used the Alouette herbed cheese spread in the middle. Will make this over & over

Very tasty. My husband loved it too.  As others suggested, pre-cook the bacon. I did but it still was not done so next time I think I will cook it fully and sprinkle on the last few minutes.  I used Alouette herbed cream cheese [found in deli section and is similar to Boursin cheese}. I think next time I will try the garlic variety and use mushroom soup and a splash of red wine.

SCORE!  Delicious!  I made these in advance then baked in the sauce when I got to my boyfriend's house which worked out very well and was spuer conveinent.  I added bacon bits to the filling and wrapped in two pieces of bacon.  Served over agg noodles with a side of steamed asparagus.  Was definitely a hit!  Thanks, Ann.

Great Recipe.  I did precook the bacon and I also used cream cheese with chives.  My son (the food critic) also thought this was great!

Excellent recipe.  I cut the breasts in half, so came out with 8 pieces, which were big enough. Also added cream of celery soup and we  liked the taste very much.  This is a keeper.  Thanks Anna

We really liked this recipe!  My Dad and the kids ate it up!  I used cream of mushroom soup, minced garlic and reduced-fat everything.  I also pre-cooked and sprinkled the bacon over the top.  This recipe was delicious and saved well for left-overs.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this dish.  I substituted green onions for chives, and added them to the sauce.  The chicken was full of flavor and tender.  Served with a wild rice dish.  Fabulous!

Thought this was pretty good and will be making again. Did come out salty and I didnt not use any bacon. Next time I will. I also used the cream cheese with chives already in there. I dont really know what the lemon juice was for, but next time, I will leave it out. Served with sides of steamed brocolli and rice pilaf. YUM!

I really liked this recipe! Would definitely make again. Looking at others suggestions, I made chicken the recipe way and then another batch with chopped bacon rolled inside too. Both ways were excellent.

I'm glad I read the reviews!  This recipie had some fine tuning done to it from all the suggestions.  I did cook the bacon first and crumble it.  I also browned the chicken first but I hadn't flattened them enough so I couldn't get them to roll so it ended up being more of a casserole than chicken rolls.  Next time I think I will skip the browning and flatten more!  I also substituted monteray jack for cream cheese and I'm glad I did!  The sauce was kinda rich but it had good flavor.  I added 1/8 tsp of garlic powder to the sauce.  Everyone loved it except my  4yr who is the pickiest eater I've ever seen.  This is definately something to be used with company and it turned out to be a little more involved than I thought it would but it turned out wonderfully and the whole family helped.  I will definately cook this again!

This was good....I precooked the bacon a bit.  My son didn't like it, and my DH didn't rave over it.  I might make again, but not in my regular rotation.  Served with Daddy's Fried Onions and Corn(from this site) and awesome garlic red mashed potatoes.

This was a great dish and wasn't hard to put together.  It was actually quite fun.  The actual test was... would my kids like it?  They LOVED it and actually went for second but couldn't finish because it was so rich (which is a good thing).  I normally alter a recipe and didn't alter this a bit.  Definitely should try!

The only change I made was to put colby jack cheese inside of the chicken instead of cream cheese.  I'm really not a big fan of cream cheese.  I can eat it in frostings and cheesecake and that's about it.  I think next time, I might try browning the bacon a little bit so it's not so mushy and seasoning up the chicken a little bit more.  It was kind of bland.  Overall avery good recipe, that looked really good, too!!  I will be trying this again with those few adjustments.

This was good, but rich.  My husband and I both enjoyed the flavors.  I used       pre-cooked bacon and made it two slices instead of one.  Gave it a great smokey flavor. Did not have mayo in the house so I substituted miracle whip. Easy and delicious!

This was very, very good.  Make sure that you don't skimp on the quality of bacon; this is the only failure I made.  However, because of this, I wasn't able to wrap all of the chicken breast (I doubled the recipe) which allowed me to sample the recipe with that omisson and it was still terrific. My only side note is that I had to cook it for an additional 15 minutes to remove "all ofthe pink".  Flavorful meal!  A keeper... Thanks, Anna!

My family absolutely LOVED this recipie!  It's become a weekly dish in our household, and the only thing I changed was reducing the cream cheese a little.  I found it a little too rich the first time.  It's hard to have leftovers with this one!

I pre-cooked the bacon after reading earlier posts because I MUST have it crispy, but it still ended up soft, probably from absorbing the sauce. Even though I didn't eat the bacon, the chicken still had a wonderful smoky flavor from it. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it, will definitely be making again!

I have made this several times and we all love it.  I make it when we have company and they rant and rave on how good it is, they think that i spent hours in the kitchen.  I double the sauce, we love the extra sauce for the noodles.  Will make again and again and again.  Thanks.

I have made this a few times, and it is wonderful.  Like so many others, I use sour cream instead of Mayo.  I dont use cream cheese, I use any form of block cheese, (monteray Jack).  And DEFINETLY cook the bacon first.  My boyfriend keeps asking me to make it.  Tonight I'll try it over the Egg Noodles.

I liked the concept of this recipe, but I did change it a little. Followed previous advice and pre cooked bacon. I used 1 cup half and half instead of the mayonnaise and milk. Personally I did not like the cream cheese. I will play around with this and try different stuffings and seasonings.

Everyone loved this, even a picky 8 year old! I added a small slice of mozzarella cheese and garlic pepper to the chicken. I used the mayo and cream of chicken and it was wonderful. I do recommend to partially cook the bacon.

Delicious but a tat too rich. I used Oscar Myer's fully cooked bacon strips since I had read reviews about the need to pre-cook bacon (this will save you some trouble if you're in a hurry). I served it on steamed white jasmine rice. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I don't use the soup. I mix a cup of heavy cream and a cup of chicken stock.
Thicken with shake and stir flour. Cook this to a pretty thick consistency and use in place of the soup. I also use more bacon. Serve over buttered wide egg noodles. My 5yo loves this.

Not a bad recipe. It did take a fair amount of prep & cook time thought. I would recommend partially frying the bacon and using sour cream instead of mayo. I'm also not a big fan of baked chicken.

I suggest adding a number of veggie side dishes to go with this.  The fat/meat content can make even the most adamant meat-eater lose his/her appetite.

This recipe was really good but I don't think it has reached it's full potential.  I would recommend frying the bacon before cooking the chicken breasts.  I think the dish would be more flavorful.

I think the next time I make this I will try and pan fry the chicken and bacon first. Then the bacon will be crispy and add more flavor. I will finish it off in the oven.

My husband loved this, but I didn't.  I thought it was bland and the sauce too rich.  I like the suggestions of using sour cream in the sauce and cheddar cheese for the filling.  I think cream of mushroom soup would be better than cream of chicken for the sauce.

My husband and I liked the chicken, especially the hickory flavor the chicken obtained from the bacon.  We both agreed that the mayo detracted from the flavor of the sauce;with my husband not fond of sour cream, I would probably just use two cans of soup and additional spices.  It is definately one that we will have again! We made pasta and served the sauce over it and our 1 and 2 year old sons loved it!

Highly recommend subbing Boursin Cheese for the cream cheese, it's already herbed and seasoned. Definitely pre-cook the bacon at least half way. This is a very heavy, rich recipe and while my husband loved it, I found it to be too much.  I think I would skip the sauce all toghether next time. Too rich.

We used pepper bacon and fresh chives. Mmmmmm. Also subbed sour cream for mayo.

I like the idea of subbing sour cream for the mayonayse. Pre-cooking the bacon sounds good too.

We both liked this, although we agreed the bacon needs to be cooked first. it could be partially cooked before being wrapped around the chicken, or fried after wrapping but before being smothered in the sauce. Overall, the recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is fantastic. The idea about precooking the bacon was definately the way to go.  Instead of mayo I used sour cream and it tasted just faboulous!! Great work!

I tripled this recipe for a large crowd and it came out just as good, we only added 15 min to the cooking time.  I used 'light' ingredients (Neufchatel instead of cream cheese), lowfat milk, no fat cream of chicken soup, etc.  It still tasted wonderful, with a thick sauce we poured over egg noodles.  We partially cooked the bacon before baking but I suggest you cook if fully next time - still good though

I made this recipe b/c my husband is not fond of chicken, but this recipe really jazzed up the chicken. I thought it was delicious. My son, on the other hand took one look at it and said he wasn't hungry!!!

This dish was WAY TO RICH!!!!  If I do make this next time, I'm substituting the mayo with milk and the cream cheese with cheddar or colby.  I added asparagus with the cream cheese.  This recipe should be renamed "Heart Attack Chicken"

This dish is very tasty. It might be a good idea to use Sizzlelean or turkey bacon as it was a little greasy.

Very good.  I made for a family dinner and everyone loved it. Would probably try and cook the bacon a little before rolling though.

The recipe never indicated that the bacon should be cooked before wrapping around the chicken breast, but I would do that next time since the bacon didn't get cooked thoroughly.

I made major modifications of this recipe to suit my husband.  Instead of cream cheese, I substituted Mexican Four Cheese.  Also, I added mushrooms for myself.  My 23 year old son warmed- up a piece the next day and raved about the taste.  Believe me, he is a hard nut to crack when it comes to food.  This is really a versitile dish.
