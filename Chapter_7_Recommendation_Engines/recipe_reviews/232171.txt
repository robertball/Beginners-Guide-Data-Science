Made this twice so far. First, as directed using the butter and cinnamon as coating after it's done cooking. Second time, I coated it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture before cooking followed by the butter and cinnamon coating. Wow! It's like Monkey bread or a cinnamon roll to go! It's very pretty, cheap, and simple. I will be keeping this recipe to pass on as a camping breakfast tradition. It was so much fun to make! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

If you want to make these at home because you are craving them but weather isn't permitting camping, follow the recipe but bake at temperature and time suggested on your biscuit can, rotating once half way through cook time.

A parent introduced this to our Cub Scout Pack, and it became a requirement at every campout. Apart from the butter and cinnamon sugar, we've had shaved chocolate to dip the biscuits into, and will even wrap chocolate inside the biscuit before cooking. The kids (and who are we kidding, parents too) love this recipe.

These tasted better than they turned out!  Pretty difficult to wrap around the stick.

it was really good frfrâ€”what I did was I coated the sticks in the butter and cinnamon-sugar when they were raw, then stuck em in the oven at the temperature recommended on the biscuit can for about 3-5 minutes less than directed. turned out perfect.

Instead of making them for breakfast, we made them with dinner and instead of putting the butter/ cinnamon/sugar, we put butter and garlic!! We called them garlic bears!!!

I made this in Junior High at lake ann camp. It was so good! The only thing that i thought is that brown sugar tastes better than cinnomen sugar. I think this tastes great!
