This was AWESOME.  I did change a few things as recommended.  Added 2 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper & 1/2 tsp Oregano to turkey meat.  Also, instead of cottage cheese, I did 1 cup low fat cottage cheese & 1 cup ricotta.  Made sure to drain and dry out spinach and shells because I saw others experienced watery consistancy.  Turned out perfect!!!  Big hit with family and did freeze extras as recommended. Yummie...this is a keeper!!!

Fantastic!  I'm a big fan of stuffed pasta dishes, and I was really pleased with the way this one turned out.  There's only two in my household, so I just put enough shells to fill an 8-inch baking dish and covered them with a small jar of spaghetti sauce.  I took the suggestion of freezing the extra stuffed shells on a cookie sheet, then I put them all into a ziploc bag.  Now I can have stuffed shells ready whenever I want!  THank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is excellent!  Husband and kids all loved it.  I added 1 package of "good seasons italian seasoning" to the meat mixture, per the comment of another user.  It was fantastic.  One thing:  you dry the noodles off a bit before stuffing them to prevent the dish from becoming soupy!

I love to cook, and this recipe was too much work (and in my opinion, too expensive) for the finished product.  We thought it was alright, but nothing special - Stuffed Shells III from this site remains our favorite.

Made this recipe for dinner with relatives and they loved it (including a 2 year old)!  A few small changes:  used fresh parsley (3 tbsp), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, used part skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese since I had it on hand.  I made sure to really squeeze the spinach, and strained the liquid after cooking the veggies and ground turkey.  I made it in the morning, put it in the fridge and pulled it out for dinner.  Worked great!  I'm so glad I have another tray in the feezer! I will make this again and again...worth the time!

These shells were very good. I loved the stuffing. Only change made was 1 cup ricotta and 1 cup cottage cheese (vs. 2 cups cottage cheese). I also topped with 1/2 the mozz. and 1/2 asiago for a bit more flavor.  Very good. I'll def. make these again!

It seemed like it would taste like cannelloni, and it did!  One bite and I was in heaven; and there was no where near the mess in the kitchen that my old "traditional" cannelloni recipe made.  I added 1/2 tsp oregano, increased the spinach to 16 oz, used extra lean (5% fat) ground beef, and a little less of the cheeses, substituting part-skim mozzarella and fat-free cottage cheese.  Thanks, Barbara, for this wonderful taste trip down memory lane.

I do not like reviewing recipes that I have changed.  Having said that I will now offer my opinion.  This was very very good after a few modifications.  Adding seasonings (2T italian and 1t oregano) as well as doubling the garlic was a start.  I subbed Fat Free ricotta for the cottage cheese and otherwise followed the directions.  I have about 3 more meals in the freezer now.  My son, who is 4, ate 3 of the shells.  I only ate 2.  I could not belive how he gobbled up this dish with spinach and mushrooms!   I am still in shock and can't wait to share this with the moms in my wednesday group!   Thanks for the great recipe and please don't hesitate to try this!   The prep can be shared with kids and then they eat a ton!

We really enjoyed this. I was craving stuffed shells, and after much searching finally decided on this recipe. I am so glad that I did. I used fresh spinach that I threw in the saute pan to wilt after I finished browning the turkey. It was actually better the next day when the flavors had a longer time to meld. Next time I make this I will prepare it the day before. Thanks so much for sharing.

I have two issues with this otherwise excellent recipe that keep it from being 5 stars. First, sauce is so easy to make.  Second, use same pot you used to boil the shells to sweat the vegetables, brown the meat and mix with the cheeses. Throw the spinach in during the last minute of cooking to evaporate any remaining liquid. Lastly, cover the bottom of the baking dish with a thin layer of sauce unless you want you shells to stick! Oh, unless you have two 9x13 baking dishes, half this recipe – there’s no way you can get all of the stuffed shells to fit in a single dish. Enjoy!

This recipe is fantastic. Everyone raves over it whenever I make it! It's well worth the time/effort it takes (although it really is not that complicated to make!) Definately suggest making this dish for dinner parties, etc - definate crowd pleaser! I like to add ricotta cheese as well (one cup cottage, one cup ricotta). I also substitue the ground Turkey with vegetarian ground "chicken". Great for vegetarians (like me!) and no one can tell the difference!

Tasty! I wasn't a pro about stuffing the shells, so it wasn't the prettiest dish I've ever made - but it turned out tasting great, which is what counts. Next time, I will probably reduce or maybe eliminate the parsley as I thought it was overpowering.

Fantastic, easy recipe. I decided to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese because my family enjoys the more traditional italian flavors.  Also, I sauted the mushrooms, onions and garlic in one pan, the ground turkey in another, and added them together at the end.  You must make sure your spinach is totally thawed and YOU MUST strain it through a wire strainer to extract all moisture.

I have to wonder if the 10 packages of spinach was a misprint because I don't see how you could possibly fit all of that spinach plus the other ingredients into one package of shells. Regardless, I only used one package of spinach which worked out fine. The dish was a big hit with my gang; especially my hubby who loved the fact that the shells contained meat. A big green salad and some nice crusty homemade Italian bread completed this tasty dinner. Thanks Barbara.

I'd have given 5 stars if you made your own sauce!  Very good stuffing for shells, thank you!  I used a recipe from another source for the pasta sauce; seems pointless to go to the work and effort and use sauce from a jar.  JUst sauteed some green pepper, onion, mushrooms with a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (chopped), 6 oz can of tomato paste, basil, marjoram, red pepper flakes, pinch of sugar, salt, fennel seed and let it simmer while I cooked the filling....wonderful!

My husband ate so much of this that I barely got enough for myself! This was a big hit and I will definitely make it again. The only things i did differently were: I used grated parmesean cheese instead of fresh because that's what we had, and I added some spaghetti sauce to the mixture before stuffing it. I also used manicotti noodles because I already had them. Could have used a little more spaghetti sauce on top, but that's a personal preference. Very good!

We really enjoyed these! The only changes I made were to halve the recipe (there are only 2 of us and I don't have space in my freezers) and I used ground beef instead of turkey since I already had it thawed out. Very good. I stuffed the shells early in the afternoon and stuck them in the fridge. When I was ready to bake them, I took them out and let them come to room temperature for about 15 minutes. Topped and baked as directed. Worked out very well. Thank you :)

Good recipe.  I used 1 cup ricatta cheese and 1 cup cottage cheese.  That was the only change I made.  Will probably make this again.

This meal always gets rave reviews at my house. I use sweet italian sausage rather than ground turkey. And I substitute onion and garlic powder for the real deal if i'm short on time and be sure not to over do if you already have a lot of flavor by using sausage.  The mushrooms can be left out depending on the tastes of the crowd you're cooking for. Then i prefer ricotta over cottage cheese.

I thought it tasted ok, but my husband told me not to make it anymore. Takes a while to make. The only changes I made were that I didn't use spinach since I didn't have any and I also used beef instead of turkey.

I had some ground turkey and was looking up recipes to use it for and found this. I thought it was pretty good, but seemed to be missing some kind of seasoning I thought. It was a little time consuming to put together, but I made it on a weekend and had more time to spend on it. I used a 1 Tblsp portion scoop and it took about 1 1/2 scoops to fill each shell. Everyone that ate it seemed to like it. What was good is that the recipe makes two pans and I had people over visiting. I served it with homemade garlic bread and it made for a good and filling meal.

This is my husband's favorite dish.  It is wonderful as-is but I will usually use twice the spinach for nutritional reasons (we have a 2-year old boy).  I always have enough shells to store in both a 9x13 and an 8x8 dish.  I freeze the smaller dish for a later day.  Always comes out WONDERFUL!!!  Thanks Barbara for a family favorite!

These are really tasty. I spend the time to make them and then freeze them on a cookie sheet. Once frozen I store in ziplock bags. I pull them out and bake them for a healthy weeknight dinner. The kids love them, and everyone gets a balanced meal in a one dish dinner.

Love this recipe!  Added more seasoning to the meat for additional flavor and I will deifnately make this again. Extras freeze easily and can be re-heated with little effort.  Great Recipe!

Very yummy...I only used 1/2 of the spinach and use Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, I also add cooked ground beef not turkey to my sauce and layered the bottom the dish with that then placed shells on that with a spoon full more of the meat sauce on top then added the cheese topping.

This recipe was fantastic!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I also used 1/2 lowfat cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta.  Turned out really well, and the leftovers were even better the next day.  I even caught my fiance eating it cold right out of the fridge!  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe - my 5 year old asks for seconds and even thirds every time I make it (which absolutely shocked me the first time!). I've discovered it makes WAY too much for my 3-member family, so I learned to stuff my shells (or manicotti, since I've only been able to find shells once), and freeze about 2/3 of them without the sauce or cheese. Then they make a pretty quick meal later - just toss them in a dish like the recipe says, cover with marinara sauce and mozzarella, cover and bake for 45 mins to an hour, until the mozzarella is melted and bubbly. Very no fuss at that point. My family loves this recipe.

A simple recipe with good flavors.  The filling was enough to stuff a 9x13 pan plus a 6" round baking dish - and there were a few shells left over from my 12oz box which was great since some of them split while boiling.  I prepared the shells ahead of time so all I had to do before dinner was slide the pans in the oven.  Personal Preference: substituted spicy pork sausage and fresh spinach.

It was a lot of work for just an ok turnout.  I appreciated the extra frozen pan though!!  I also added Italian seasoning.  I probably won't ever use the ground turkey for this recipe again, I really just like the taste of beef MUCH better!

This recipe was so easy to follow!  I followed it exactly, and the shells came out so amazing!  There was enough shells to fill a 9X13 pan and also a smaller 2 quart baking dish!  The shells were yummy, cheesy and delicious.  My 6 year old even ate them up, spinach and mushrooms and all (he is such a picky eater too).  Love this recipe!  Will definitely continue to make.

This was really good- Just need to add some spices, such as italian seasoning. I mixed Hot sausage and ground beef to the ground turkey.  I like my dishes a little zesty!

This was pretty good, but I think the meat mixture needed some extra seasoning, possibly with oregano, basil and more garlic.  It seemed a little bland to me.  I made 2 changes but I don't think it affected the flavor as far as seasonings go.  First, I don't like cottage cheese in anything so I used ricotta.  Second, I used fresh spinach as that was all I had.  This recipe makes alot!  I should have looked at the number of servings because there were only 2 of us eating it so we tired of it after the 2nd meal.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half, and add the seasonings I mentioned above.

These were delicious... Next time we make them we will cut back a little on the spinach though - I felt like most of the shell that I had was spinach.

These were very good!! I did leave out the spinach, but other that that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband ate almost half of them and my 2 year old went back for seconds as well! I made a second batch to freeze. So, we will definitely have them again! :)

These were so good! I am a huge fan of lasagna, but I was sceptical of trying a recipe that was stuffed with just cheese. I use ricotta out of personal preference. My kids and nephew loved them. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved these! I added a couple of tablespoons of Italian Seasoning and some oregano to a double recipe, as suggested in other reviews. I froze a lot of stuffed the shells on a cookie sheet and then put the frozen shells in ziplock bags for later. This was a hit with everyone and I will definitely be making it again!

Good 'base' recipe - my changes included using 5 ground up spicy italian sausages (removed from casing) mixed with the onions & garlic & cheeses. I also 2.5 cups ricotta in place of cottage cheese and threw in some dried basil & garlic salt. I made sure I completely covered the shells with 1 Large Can Spaghetti Sauce with Mushrooms in it+ 1 small can tomato sauce,  and sprinkled with lots of cheese. This recipe made enough for a 9X13 dish for dinner, plus to almost fill an 8x11 pan to freeze for another night. Enjoy.

I was so excited to try this recipe, but all I had in my pantry was penne shaped pasta. So, I used all the ingredients and made a baked pasta casserole which turned out great! Great flavors and very tasty. I can’t wait to try it again with shell pasta! Thanks, Barbara!

The spinach over-powered everything else in the recipe.  I didn't like it at all.  I couldn't even eat it nor would my daughter.  If I did make it again I may try using fresh spinach and not as much of it.  Also, more spices would be helpful.

I guess I was hoping for more based on the reviews of this recipe.  My family thought these were okay, but nothing special.  I followed the directions exactly as written, except added some italian seasoning as suggested by others.  I still think they weren't that flavorful, even with the italian seasoning.  Maybe using italian sausage instead of the ground turkey would help, although it would increase the fat significantly.  Also, the stuffing mixture wasn't as creamy and cheesy as I like in stuffed shells.  I used my own homemade sauce, which helped out with this recipe, but they just weren't what I was looking for.  This does make a lot- I have another two meals worth of these in the freezer.  I'm sure we'll eat them, but I'll try another recipe once they're gone.

This was FANTASTIC!  If you're finding it too bland, make sure you add plenty of salt and use fresh parsley...don't do the dried stuff.  I altered it a little to make it low fat and undercooked the shells a little so that they wouldn't get mushy while baking.  

Even my boyfriend who isn't a fan of mushrooms, onions or ground turkey loved it.  He was really surprised when I told him it was ground turkey.  Prep time was a little long but it makes so much that it's worth it.  Good idea for a weekend meal.

Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent!!  I used extra lean ground turkey, and reduced the parmesan to 1/2 cup to make it extra lowfat.  I used a bag of fresh spinach (chopped) instead of frozen, and 2 - 26 oz. jars of Healthy Choice spaghetti sauce (1 for each pan - I like a lot of sauce).  I also used 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Bake for 20 minutes with foil on to keep it from drying out, then 10 minutes with the foil off.  Pretty time consuming dish, but worth the effort.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was very good but not outstanding. The only thing I did differently was to use beef instead of turkey. Growing up with Italian food I think it needed more Italian spices (oregano, basil, etc.). For the work involved, I think I'd rather throw some lasagna together with the meat and veggies.

We tried this last night and I thought it was pretty good.  It was funny reading through the reviews that some people were trying to put in more than 1 package of spinach into this recipe.  It even made for better leftovers.  I had so much that I had to use 2 9x13 dishes to hold it all.  I had to give it a 3 because my husband didn't like the ground turkey (It was our first time trying it.).  I think it would be better to use 1/2 the amount of turkey and 1/2 italian sausage.

These are very good.  I did alter it a bit by adding non-fat sour cream (for zing) and of course I used non-fat cottage cheese to make it as healthy as it was flavorful.  I agree with a previous reviewer that you need to watch the amount of tomato sauce as it will overpower the mild flavors of the filling.  There is also no need for a full 8oz. of mozzarella cheese – half of that is just fine.

Very good and very healthy - loved the garlic/mushrooms and onion mix (only used a quarter of an onion minced and found that to be plenty).  Did not include the parsley - don't care for it and followed someone else's suggestion of adding a drained can of diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic and onions.  Adding a flavored sauce (Barilla sweet peppers spaghetti sauce) added a lot so additional flavoring wasn't necessary.  BTW, this made SIX servings, not FOURTEEN!

Everybody loves these at our house! I didn't have turkey so used ground beef instead and made sure they were covered in plenty of sauce. Otherwise, followed the recipe. They stay moist cooking with the foil on. I took it off at the end and added the mozzarella to melt for a few more minutes in the oven.

I seasoned the ground beef with dry Italian Dressing mix, like other reviewers. In my opinion it needed more seasoning, so I also added basil and oregano too.  I ended up making 2 8x8 dishes and froze one. I love dishes that make something to freeze.  This was a dud with my 7 and 4 yr old.  They both love lasagna but thought the filling was "slimy.". Neither would eat it and my 4 year old literally eats everything.  It wasn't wet either.  I thought it wasn't half bad.  The biggest problem was that I used a store bought sauce and I am always disappointed with store bought sauces,,, but it was free and I needed to use it.  My husband liked it too but I think I will just stick with lasagna next time.

Delicious!  This was one of the first somewhat complicated recipies I have tried on my own. I took others recommendations and added 2 tbs of italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper & 1/2 tsp oregano. I also used 1 cup ricotta chess to substitute for 1 of the 2 cups of cottage cheese. I added some fresh chopped tomatoes--we love tomatoes! Otherwise followed the recipe and this turned out fantastic!! It made a LOT, so I froze in meal sizes. Leftovers still tasted great..now if I could only get my boyfriend to eat leftovers :)

This dish was really good the only thing different I did was add more cheese because we are some cheese eaters in my family. Other then that everything else was kept the same.

I made these for my boyfriend's family and they enjoyed it TREMENDOUSLY. (Hello BONUS!)  These really were delicious and the turkey meat made it lighter than say another recipe that uses beef.  I, myself, made a few changes, which included:
a. 1 cup skim ricotta and 1 cup of cottage cheese instead of the 2 cups cottage cheese.  I only did this because I don't enjoy the taste or texture of cottage cheese, but in reality you couldn't taste it when baked.  
b. Once the spinach was completely thawed out, I squeezed small handfuls of it, in order to remove the water (as to prevent watery-ness when baked). 
c. A good handful of chopped parsley
d. I only boiled the pasta shells for 8 min, because I didn't want them too soft and mushy when I baked them
e. I used smoked mozzarella rather than fresh and grated it myself

Lastly, I think it could've used an additional clove of garlic.

I undercooked the onion so that was too crunchy.  I suspect this is why my 2-year old would not eat it.  There was a little too much spinich in this for me but my husband really liked the shells.

The filling was delicious!  I used the food processor to make the cottage cheese more like ricotta texture.  I didn't have any shells at home, so I made lasagna rolls instead.  Just cooked the noodles and spread the filling over the noodle and rolled.  Followed the rest of the directions.  My husband and I both loved it!  It was like individual portions of lasagna.  I'm going to make it for our next dinner guests.....

This is a great recipe! I made a couple of minor changes. I used Ricotta cheese because I had it...and it was very good. This time when I made it, I used the Vodka Sauce, and it's really good with the turkey and spinach. Also added some basil and oregano. Thanks for sharing! This is one of my favorites!

I made this recipe with ground beef instead of turkey.  Also, my package of spinach was 12 oz, as was my bag of shredded mozzarella cheese.  I was able to pack a 10x13" pan as well as an 8x8" pan, which I froze for another day (before baking it).   My husband is kind of picky, as is our 1 year old son, but we all gobbled this up! I felt great watching our little one chow down on spinach and beef. This one is a keeper!!!

This was a very yummy recipe. The whole family loved it. I added a little bit of ground Italian sausage to the ground turkey because I think that stuff goes great with italian food. Definitely use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I made one batch with cottage and one with ricotta and the cottage cheese one was the best. I put italian seasoning in my recipe like others suggested. I didn't need to cook them for the entire 30 min but I think they got done faster because I forgot to put the foil over them. Wished I had because some of the shells were just a tiny bit crunchy on the very edge. This is absolutely a keeper and I will make again for sure. I do wish I could have found some whole wheat shells though. I wouldn't feel as guilty eating this if I had.

I thought these were delicious. And very pretty. I followed the recipe without mushrooms as there were mushroom haters in the group. I love the flavor the turkey gives. A nice change from beef.

Excellent and so healthy!  I used fresh blanched spinach, instead of frozen, and I used low-fat ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.   Still came out quite nicely.  It was a little labor-intensive so I wouldn't recommend this for easy weeknight cooking but definitely good for the weekend!

Great combination!  I used low fat ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I halved the recipe - it made one 9 x 13 pan.  I added a dash of nutmeg and some italian seasoning in filling.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Very good recipe. It made enough shells for a 13x9 pan and an 8x8 as well. I added some dried basil and finely diced carrot to the meat mixture for some more sweetness. I will definitely make this again. Can't wait to get the rest out of the freezer!

This was so delicious BUT I would cut the spinach down just a little, maybe 3/4 of the 10 oz package.  It overpowered the turkey a little.

This was awesome!  I too substituted 1 cup of ricotta for 1 cup of cottage cheese and added some Italian seasoning.  It definitely passes the kid-test.  My 15 year old stepson had 7 shells in 1 sitting and our 1 year old downed 1 1/2!  The shells turn out very pretty, so it makes for great presentation too.  I've already shared the recipe with several co-workers.  This also re-heats well.

Oh my gosh!!! Loved it!!  I was looking for some ways to use ground turkey and this is my new favorite.  I undercooked the noodles, added some extra spices (oregeno, italian seasoning) and froze half of the stuffed shells.  Those were all helpful tips from other reviews.  I can't wait to take them out of the freezer and share them with guests.

I gave this 3 stars because I had hoped that the other ingredients would mask the spinach better. My 16 year old daughter and my husband requested that I do not make it again, although my husband agreed to at least eat the leftovers. The 2 year old ate it but picked out all of the spinach, he loves pasta. The 4 year old had cereal, although that doesn't mean much as he is SO picky!

This recipe is bland.  If I were to make it again I would have loaded it with lots of Italian seasoning, particularly basil.  Also, the ingredients as called for in the recipe filled a 9X13 dish AND an 8X8 dish, so I had to find additional sauce for the smaller dish.  Otherwise, I think it is a pretty healthy dish,

This was excellent.  I didn't have jumbo shells so I used manicotti and it worked great.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. I did use mild italian sausage that I needed to use. 
While browning the sausage I added a premixed italian seasoning that came with a spice rack I got for christmas.  I used paul newmans italian sausage sauce. It was a good meal.  I think next time I will use spicy italian sausage.  The amount of the  filling was perfect. I was able to fill all the shells in the 12 oz box of pasta. 

I froze the rest for a quick meal to take to the potluck at work.

Very good but shells got a little mushy. I undercooked them in the pot but they still fell apart. The filling was yummy though. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe. Thanks.  I served it during a family gathering with salad and texas toast.  Everybody loved it!!  I did make a few minor changes, though.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

We really liked this.  I made 1/2 a recipe with turkey and thought it was great. A week later I substitued beef but didn't like it as well. I think the turkey is better with the spinach flavors.

I think was great!  I did make a few changes, 1st i used ground beef for a more flavor and didnt use mushrooms (moms allergic) but followed it well and made 2 pans! Put one in the freezer I am sure it will taste just as good the 2nd time around too!   Thanks!
Ok I did reheat the 2nd pan and it turned out just as good as the 1st time around!

These turned out so great.  I made them for a party on New Years Eve and everyone loved them.  I didn't think they were that big of a pain to make.  The adjustments that I made were using about 2 Tablespoons of Italian seasoning and using 1/2 a pound ground beef and 1/2 a pound Italian sausage.  I also added some crushed red pepper.  All of those things spiced it up nicely.  I'll definitely make it again.

This meal is now going to become a family favorite in our household.  I love that it makes a lot that I can freeze for later. Only changes I made were instead of cottage cheese, I replaced it with ricotta and I added italian seasoning to the ground turkey.  This is a keeper!!! Thanks Barbara.

Great recipe!  It could maybe use a bit more flavor, maybe some more garlic or some italian seasonings would help to spice it up a bit :).  Instead of turkey I used 1/2 lean ground beef (93% lean) and 1/2 lowfat sausage.  I also used fat free cottage cheese to reduce the fat content even more (though for stuffed shells, this was amazingly healthy).  My husband loved that there was meat in the shells, and it made tons of filling, so each shell was very full.  You can maybe reduce the amount of cheese on top because it comes out very cheesy, but we liked it this way.  I made the filling ahead of time and refrigerated it, and it was so easy to put together!  Two thumbs way up on this recipe - goes in my permanent box!

A great recipe when you have a lot of time on your hands. We substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and it was excellent! Half of the recipe fed the two of us for a good three days.

The taste was pretty good but way TOO MUCH Spinach.  I only bought 5 packages (16oz.) of spinach and still had to discard about 2 cups.  3 packages (16oz.) would be sufficient.  This should have been called spinach stuffed shells for all the spinach lovers since you don't get very much turkey or any other flavor.

THIS WAS THE BEST STUFFED SHELLS I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!... MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE TOMATO SAUCE OVERPOWERED THE WOUNDERFUL FLAVOR OF THE STUFFING IN THE SHELLS. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO USE A SAUCE WITH A VERY MILD FAVOR.

it was a big hit w/ the family, but I felt the meat/cheese mixture could have used more flavor...may try again with more salt and some oregano or something.

This was delicious!  I didn't put any parsley in it and I changed the cottage cheese to Ricotta cheese.  Also, I made it with the intent to freeze it.  Next time I will not put the mozzarella cheese on top for cooking then add it when I heat it up.  Maybe next time I will try with ground beef.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I did as one reviewer suggested--stuffed the uncooked shells with the filling and used extra liquid in my sauce. This worked great when I used shells that were formed mostly open. Some of my shells were almost closed when raw. i saved them for another time. i worked 27 yrs. in an  institutional kitchen and this is the way we always made lasagna. The filling was very tasty and I will use this recipe in the future.

This was a real hit with my family, one of which who doesn't eat enough veggies.  I substuted oregano instead of thyme and used garlic puree instead of garlic cloves.  I'll definitely be making this again, but next time I'll use more garlic.

I would cut down on the spinach and add more beef but other than that it was amazing!

I used all ricotta with a tablespoon of sour cream in the mixture. I also mixed a 5 cheese pasta sauce with tomato basil marinara. The cheesier the better, I always say!

Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up!  Loved, loved this recipe!  I used extra seasonings (as suggested by other reviews) and half cottage cheese and half ricotta.  Also used only half of the spinach.  I had two servings and that is really unusual for me!  Recipe makes a lot so you may want to think about freezing half for another meal.

I replaced the turkey with browned lean hamburger and also I used 1 cup cottage cheese and 1 cup ricotta cheese in place of the (2 cups of cottage cheese). We loved it and will make again. I filled 20 pasta shells and divided into 8X8 pans to freeze one for later.

This is one of the few recipes I find myself making again and again! The mushrooms are a great way to make the meat go further and the dish still feels hearty and satisfying. I make this without the shells sometimes and top with cheese like a casserole. Healthy comfort food! :)

This was very good.  It was easy to make, but a bit time consuming to stuff the shells.  Was nice that it made 2 pans full for 2 dinners!  i put one in the freezer!

Delicious! By passed the mushrooms, instead used green peppers. Also added Oregano, a pinch of sugar, 1 cup of ricotta cheese and some left over ground turkey to the spaghetti sauce! It was truly delicious.

Made this recipe last night...wonderful. I have never made stuffed shells before. They turned out perfect. These stuffed shells were a big hit. Will be making again, I did use my own home made spaghetti sauce. Thanks for sharing.

Whenever I try a recipe for the first time, I always follow the recipe as written. I will, though, admit that I added more garlic than called for because we love it so. Other than the garlic, I wouldn't change a thing. It was really awesome!!!!! My only complaint, and this has nothing to do with the recipe or the person who submitted it, is that I couldn't find big enough pasta shells. The ones I bought were hard to fill because while the box said "jumbo" they weren't that big. I will be adding this to my three ring  binder of the recipes I've tried and will continue making on a regular basis.

Easy recipe and yummy! Just wish I had added oregano and basil.  Followed recipe exactly and didn't think about it until it was too late. Good idea to thaw and strain spinach as it says. Cook shells ahead of time and give them time to dry, also.

This was delicious!  Definitely a winner!  I love stuffed shells and love to try new filling recipes.  I thought this one sounded good with the spinach in it and it didn't disappoint.  I always normally season my turkey mixture with extra seasoning while sauteeing, so I added my usual chile flakes, italian seasoning, onion and garlic powders.  Also instead of cottage cheese since we never have it, I used a block and a half of cream cheese instead because I love the extra creaminess it gives.  The filling was amazing!  It was so good and very versatile to use in other dishes.  I actually didn't have enough pasta shells, so I used the rest of the filling to layer in another casserole dish with large noodle rigatoni pasta to go along with it.  Excellent recipe!  My hubby and I both loved it and will be eating the leftovers for tomorrows dinner with a nice salad and breadsticks.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The final product was amazing. but it did take longer to make than what was suggested. Also it wasn't the cheapest thing to make, but it also made 2 pans. I loved it and everyone else who tried it couldn't get enough.

This makes so much!  Which is good as we enjoyed it.  Hoping the rest freezes well as I went ahead and stuffed the rest and put into freezer.  Both the man and the little man enjoyed... And neither are fans on onion or spinach!

I made one small change I used broccoli instead of spinach and it was GREAT!.  Next time I do want to use more onions. I didn't use the full amount directed. My family loved it.  I will be making this again in the future!

I liked the  result a lot... my honey LOVED it.  I used Italian Sausage (had on hand due to a sale). instead of the turkey.  For my taste it was a little heavy on the spinach, may try fresh next time.  I agree with another poster, this was a lot of work; but in my opinion worth the result.  I will make the filling ahead next time and stuff the shells the night of dinner so as to spread out the work and make it an option for a week night.

I used ground veal instead and went with 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. Also I used plain tomato sauce and added oregano, marjoram, and hot pepper flakes to make the sauce. Everything turned out amazing and I had tons left over to freeze!

This is fantastic! I did make one change, I used half cup cottage cheese and a half cup ricotta (instead of 1 cup cottage). I just wanted the inside to have just a bit more body. I like it because there are so many vegetables with the ground turkey. Very delicious. Make sure to use pepper!

This is a great recipe, a lot of work but really good! Instead of using ground turkey I used a mild Turkey Sausage. My in-laws loved it as well as me! The prep time should be changed to about an hour though if you are slow at chopping like I am. Also I don't care for mushrooms so I only used half of the amount and made sure to finely chop them up. I also used baby bella mushrooms opposed to white mushrooms. I couldn't even tell they were in there. :-)))

Husband and I loved this recipe.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese! I also seasoned the meat/veggies with Italian dressing dry packet seasoning.  But other than that I followed this recipe exactly.  It reminded me of lasagna but in shells. I have tons of leftovers since it just us two!

I added Italian seasoning and half a red pepper I had leftover.  Makes 2 pans of stuffed shells.  Still needs a little more spices, but a good base to experiment with!

My family really liked this recipe. I did make a few changes. I used ground beef, and fresh spinach.  I wilted the spinach in the hot frying pan before adding the cheeses. I also made the spaghetti sauce from scratch.

Excellent dish! Everyone went back for seconds, and my 9 year-old licked the sauce off his plate.  This is not a quick dish to whip up.  It is simple, but takes time.  I did mine on a Saturday in steps.  I used fresh baby spinach that I sauteed, then put in a strainer to drain off the excess juices. I also let my cooked pasta shells air dry in the collander before stuffing. Didn't want to risk a watery pasta dish that other reviewers mentioned.  Season well with Italian spices, in addition to salt and pepper. I used Newman's Own Tomato & Basil, which also kicked up the flavor profile.  This one's a keeper!

I made these using Italian sausage instead of turkey. I know it's not as healthy, but it adds so much more flavor. I also used shredded mozzarella in place of the cottage cheese. I am not a huge fan of the texture of cottage cheese. I also omitted the mushrooms. Again it's a textural thing for me. And subbed the frozen spinach for 6 oz bag of fresh spinach. It came out really well! Thanks!

This was great!! I made a couple substitutions - 2 bell peppers for the mushrooms and sun-dried tomato fettuccine sauce for the spaghetti sauce since that's what I had on hand- it was decadent and delicious!!!

I changed the cottage cheese to ricotta because I'm not so sure how I feel about cottage cheese and love love love ricotta. Also didn't use onion because I didn't have any, but wished I had in the end. Flavor was very mild- could've used the onion flavor. Overall very good- and made a ton!! Excited to have some in the freezer for later!

Made as is and was pleased. Accidentally put the mozzarella cheese into the mixture and I'm glad I did.  Next time I would like to add some if the suggested spices left by others but as is  had great flavor. Served with broccolini.

Oh my goodness delicious! I subbed the turkey for Italian sausage but otherwise stuck to the recipe as is. I paired this with a salad and garlic bread. Absolutely tastey, I will make again.

I made this for dinner yesterday for my family and it was a big hit. Of course I changed a few things, but the base recipe is delicious. I used ground Italian Sausage instead of turkey, used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and made my own sauce which added some more spice to the meal. They came out of the oven piping hot and ready to serve. My 6 yo granddaughter was a little leery at first of trying it, but once she tasted them she finished her whole plate. I'm glad I had enough for seconds.

Wow, this was fabulous--addictive even. I didn't expect a recipe like this to be such a sensation. Thought we'd have lots of leftovers, like we usually do (for freezing), but this flew out of the pan with seconds and thirds. I did add Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper, and I used half ricotta, half cottage cheese. Just awesome.

This is my husband's most requested meal! I always have enough left over to freeze for an additional meal because it's just the two of us. I use sweet Italian sausage instead of the ground turkey and would highly recommend it; the flavor complements the dish so well. I also use fresh spinach and sauté it along with the mushrooms, add a little bit of crushed red pepper and dried oregano to the meat mixture, and sub ricotta for cottage cheese. This is our go-to Italian meal and will be for a while!

good but not satisfying.  liked the idea of mushrooms, garlic and onions. worth the extra effort of sauteeing and washing an extra pan. Ricotta is more authentic.  Didn't get gobbled up in our household, but it was easy enough to make.

This has really good taste. Instead of stuffing shells, I used ziti and made it like baked ziti instead. I put some of the sauce at the bottom, mixed the pasta with the filling and covered it with the rest of the sauce and cheese. It made a 13 x 9 pan, which was too much for us but leftovers were fantastic. I will split into two 8 x 8 pans next time and freeze one. Only other change was no mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. Will definitely make again.

I used the homemade sauce from the worlds best lasagna recipe on this site (using turkey and turkey sausage) and used it to pour over the shells.  I stuffed them with the cheese mixture.  I used ricotta on half and cottage cheese on the other half.  It was yummy!  My husband loved the cottage cheese ones, I loved the ricotta ones.  Froze the left overs too! Next time I will double the cheese mixtures to use all the shells, I think without the meat in the shells it was wasn't enough stuffing for all the shells.

Love this for sure! Instead of the spaghetti sauce from a jar, I used the pumpkin chipotle pasta sauce from here. They complemented each other perfectly. The spiciness of the sauce went really well with the stuffing. Great dinner, great recipe! Thank you very much, Barbara!

My family loved it, including my picky children.  Followed the recipe, except I used the Spaghetti Sauce recipe instead of jarred sauce, fresh spinach, and drained the grease prior to adding the salt, pepper, etc.

These were absolutely delicious!  Only thing I did different was I only had a 16 oz. jar of sauce, so I added a can of diced tomatoes to it along with a pinch of Italian Seasoning and Hot Pepper Flakes to add a little heat.

Yum! This is a great recipe. I used ground beef instead of turkey, but kept everything else the same. I liked the mushrooms in it.

Yummy! I only gave it 4 stars because I made two changes. I used 1 c ricotta and 1 c cottage cheese in place of 2 c's cottage cheese. I used low fat on both to try and cut down on some calories. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen because I was making this right after work for dinner. This would have made more than 1 9x13 dish, but I had several broken shells so I only got a full 9x13 dish full of this delightfulness. My 16 yo daughter said these were awesome! Oh, I did add about a teaspoon or so of garlic salt to the ground turkey while it was cooking.

These were delicious! Did not make many changes... I omitted the mushrooms and parsley. 

These were so healthy and satisfying. I served them with steamed green beans. I added some of the extra sauce from the shells to the beans and it was the perfect pairing. Great! Will 100% make again.

These were FANTASTIC.. my son said they tasted just like the stuffed caneloni at Olive Garden!  I added a few extra shells (out of a 2nd box) but didn't need them. The filling was just enough for one whole box, depending on how full you stuff them.. I stuffed them pretty full.  I filled a 13x9 pan and a small casserole dish.  I did have a problem with liquid at the bottom. And I made sure the pasta was dry and patted all the liquid out of the spinach.  I'm guessing maybe just the covering with foil may have been the reason for it.. condensation while it's cooking maybe.  The cheese probly would have gotten overcooked had I not covered it tho.  Next time I may cook uncovered and either take my chances on over cooked cheese OR, just not put it on till 15 mins before it's done.  All in all.. even with the liquid.. it was GREAT! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night and it was excellent AND easy to pull together. I did add Oregano instead of parsley while the meat was cooking, I also added a package of Italian seasoning and had one cup of small curd cottage cheese and one cup of ricotta. My sweetheart said it was perfect and cleaned his plate!

Awesome recipe! A couple of things I did differently: used beed instead of turkey, didn't have spinach on hand, & my family is not a fan of mushrooms so left those out too. It was still delish! Def cooking it again!

Great Recipe.  I used Italian sausage and added a little basil and oregano.  I also spread a little spagettil sauce in the bottom of the dish before placing the shells in there.  Since there are only 2 of us, I used 2  8x8 baking dishes and froze one casserole for later.

These were great & worked well with gluten free shells.  I used kale in place of the spinach since that's what I had and did half turkey/half beef.  I added italian seasonings to the mix and used ricotta cheese, again since it is what I had.  Super yummy!!

I love this recipe but instead of ground turkey I added shredded chicken (I cooked it in the crockpot the day before). I also used fat free ricotta instead of cottage cheese and a little bit of egg beater to hold it all together. I prepared it a day early and just let it hang out in my fridge for a day and then I probably cooked it for a little over an hour. It turned out so good! My friends were very impressed!!!

I used beef instead of turkey. as is 4 star.  after tasting I added oregano, thyme and touch of basil to season.  I also mixed in a little of the spag. sauce to the meat/cheese mixture. I love that it contains spinach, and you can't taste it. I vacuum sealed the extra and froze them for later (just without the sauce on top, I will do that when ready to eat)  They are very yummy.

Good and yammy looking dish. I put 3/4 cup of Parmesan and 1/4 Mozzarella cheese. I omitted the spinach (didnt have any), but it was good without it.

We're trying to cut fat and calories, and this was the best stuffed shells recipe for this.  I used fat free cottage cheese, used about 1/2 the parmesan cheese, and used less than 1 cup of mozzarella for the topping.  I would rate what I made at about 4 stars...more cheese would have been tastier!  But it was great as it was, and moreover, my 5-year-old loved them!

My family loved this recipe.  It was so good.  I changed a few minor things and spiced my meat with various seasoning.  Overall I stayed with the same technique.  It takes a little bit of time, but it was well worth it!  Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  I used beef instead of the turkey, but other than that I followed it to a T.  Made them two days prior to my son's birthday party, refridgerated and poured sauce on before baking!  AWESOME Recipe!  Thanks Barbara!

Really Good, tried to make lowfat, by using lite mozzarella, and lowfat cottage cheese.  Not bad, next time might go for the regular cheeses, but really good, and the family loved!!

I have used cottage cheese before and unless you have cheese cloth it is really runny. So I replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta and put a vegetarian spin on it by using ground up tofu mixed in with the shells and it turns out great!

This recipe was great.  I had never made stuffed shells with the meat mixed with the cheese filling inside the noodle, I usually had the meat with the spaghetti sauce.  I used Italian ground turkey and also added mozzerella cheese to the stuffing mixture.  We all loved it.

We LOVED these!  I used ground sirloin, (it's what I had), I did add basil, oregano and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture.  I also used 1 cup cottage cheese and I cup ricotta.  I sprinkle just a touch of Italian seasoning over the Mozzerella for looks.    YUM!!!!!  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

I made these as directed and they were good but i think a couple of minor changes would make them better. I think using either ricotta or a combination of ricotta and cottage cheese would be better and also, i would use more than 32 oz. of sauce. I found that even with the shells covered with tin foil while baking , they had some crispy parts because there wasn't enough sauce covering them.

Absolutely delicious!! Greg loved them.  I made 2 substitutions: Used a shredded rotiserie chicken instead of ground turkey and 2 cups ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.    Next time maybe half the recipe as we needed to make 2 batches and had leftovers for days...

Excellent taste!  Did not use the spinach, boiled some broccoli with the pasta shells & chopped the broccoli when cooked. Did not make any other changes & will definitely make again.  Thank You!

This was tasty---but pretty basic for flavor in my opinion. Good but nothing special.

This is a very good "company" dish.  It's simple to make, but looks like you put forth the extra effort.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  My seven year old son loved it too!  That's always a plus.

Very good. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I added a little fresh ground nutmeg, and some red pepper.  Next time I think I'll also add some fennel seeds to give it that sausage flavor without all the fat.

Way too much spinach!  I agree with another reviewer who said to use a lot less spinich and use fresh.  I love spinach, but even this was too much for me to enjoy the dish.  I gave it two stars for the fact that we did eat it and the leftovers the next day tasted better.  Thanks anyhow!  Others obviously like it.  :)

I used ground chicken instead of ground turkey because it was all I could find. I was in a rush the day I made this, so before I went out I precut the garlic, onion and mushrooms and sealed in and put in the refrigerator and then added the spinach and cheeses and parsley in another container and put it in the fridge. When  I got home that evening the prep for the meal was nearly done and it was in the oven in 20 minutes! Will definetly make again.

This was absolutely the best ever!  I have never had stuffed shells before but this hit the spot!  My kids didn't care for it that much just because of the spinach but my husband and I both loved it.

Wow! We loved this recipe! We have finicky toddlers, so I've been trying to find a way to "sneek" in veggies, and this recipe was perfect. They love pasta and cheese already, and the tomato sauce was the perfect cover up for the mushrooms and spinach. They never saw the vegetables coming. Delicious!

My family loves this recipe.  Good way to get them to eat spinach.  It does make alot so it is a good recipe to make ahead and freeze half. Next time I'm going to try pork sausage instead of turkey for a spicy/different taste.

I followed the recipe but would make some changes next time.  I thought the turkey was bland and would use beef next time and I will try ricotta cheese.  And definitely absorb the excess moisture from the spinach and shells before stuffing the shells as my sauce came out very thin.  Overall my boyfriend and I enjoyed the meal and would try these again.

Very tasty!  Also makes fabulous leftovers.  My grocery store was out of jumbo shells, so I used manicotti.  Much more difficult to stuff but still incredibly good.

Good stuff!  I made it for my family.  My dad is vegetarian, so I made a separate portion for him, substituting the turkey with veggie "meat" crumbles, and it came out great!  Next time I'm going to try marinating the meat in something, to give the meal extra flavor.

Very good and easy to make.  Due to the spinach crisis, I was not able to add this to the meal but looking forward to trying it with the spinach once the crisis is over.

Very easy. I didn't have all the ingredients, but it was still good with what I did use.

I used ground chicken breast and omitted the mushrooms. I made sure to drain my shells and pat them w/ a papertowel so that the sauce would not get watery.  I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage.  This was very good.

Well, in an effort to ward off blandness (as warned by other reviewers), I think I overcompensated and added too much seasoning to these!  I added extra garlic, salt, pepper and italian seasoning, but the result was too much.  Anyways, other than that these were good, I love how huge the recipe is because even though it DOES take a while to prepare, now my boyfriend and I have three night's worth of dinners!  Didn't care for the turkey though, next time I will use extra lean ground beef (96/4), which has even LESS fat.  Thanks!

This was okay.  I thought it was a bit bland & think it would be better with beef or Italian sausage instead of turkey.

Very good.  I did add Italian Seasoning to give it some more flavor.  This is actually a stuffed shells recipe that I will make again.  I don't usually like them.

I made this meatless (only because my ground turkey died before I got the chance to use it!).  Used 2 cans of sliced mushrooms plus extra shakes of all seasonings (to combat blandness previous reviewers mentioned).  Froze stuffed shells on cookie sheets then popped them into freezer bags.  We've used one bag - with italian sausage Ragu, 4oz shredded mozzarella and 1/4c of shredded parmesan.  I think I'll try alfredo sauce on the next batch.

Very easy recipe.  I added a little more spice to the ground turkey and it gave it a little more "zip".  The ground turkey tends to be really bland, so I added garlic pepper & seasoned salt to taste.  I will make this again-great for leftovers-just warm & serve!

Fantastic.. a bit time consuming filling all the shells (A LOT OF SHELLS) but I was able to feed my family, mom, and aunt's family in one batch. Totally worth it, totally healthy. Great Sunday night recipe.

Awesome!! I had a rigatoni recipe that was my "signature" pasta dish, but this recipe has replaced it. My husband & daughter ate these shells up and asked for more.

My husband loved these! I did however revise it a little by adding 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 2 tsp oregano to the turkey mixture. I thought it could use some more flavor. I also found 1 jar of sauce to be not enough. I'll use 2 next time. Thanks for the recipe! A+

Delicious!  Made this for company and they raved!  I think next time I would probably add some seasoning to the turkey mixture, but it was good in it's own right.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were absolutely great, and I was amazed at how the mixture and the shells were perfectly matched in amount.  I fed this to my husband, sister, her fiance, and little brother and they all loved them.  My sister's fiance is a chef, so that is high praise!  I used ground venison instead of ground turkey, and it was delicious!

This recipe was wonderful. I did change it just a little. I used Ricotta Cheese rather than Cottage and used two jars of sauce. My family likes a lot of sauce on their pasta.

This was wonderful, but I'm hoping someone can answer a question:  At what point can you freeze these?  Freeze with or without the sauce?  Thanks so much.

I planned ahead and prepared the filling a day before.  It was great.  As I prepared it I loved the smell of the filling and when it all came together it was great.  My household loved it.  This is something I'm going to have to cook more often.

The preperation took a lot longer than noted in the recipe.  It was more like an hour of prep time than 30 minutes.

This recipe was excellent for an Italian alternative!  Loved the spinach!!  Prep work took some time, but that's what makes cooking fun!
