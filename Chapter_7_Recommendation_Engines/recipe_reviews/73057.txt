These were soooo---good. I made them for Christmas. The only change made was that I used no sesame seeds and double the sunflower seed.

These were great!  It's a pretty foolproof recipe.  I subbed in extra and different types of seeds and nuts and it was awesome.  Thanks for the recipe.

In looking at the reviews, this recipe has been around since 2006 with only a dozen reviews.  I thought these bars were awesome.  Easy to mix up, and the texture was just perfect.  They're not too sticky and would be the perfect snack to have in the car for a road trip.  The cranberries give you a little zing of tartness, and there's just a  hint of the peanut butter flavor. I think the next time I'll use both cranberries and apricots, and maybe add a little more peanut butter.  Nice recipe to "make your own" by varying the nuts and dried fruits.  This one is going into my "Favorites" file.  Thanks JOENAUJOKAS for sharing your recipe.

These bars are so good.  My 9 year old daughter made them for a 4-H project for the county fair and won first place.  We used salted sunflower seeds and not raw ones and added a few extra pecans. All of my kids liked them too.

I made these for my husband to take on a backpacking trip.  Followed the recipe except to omit the coconut, which neither of us care for.  They were good... kind of a glorified and slightly heartier Rice Krispie Square.  Would make again for day hikes and camping trips as they travel and pack well.

A rice-krispie squares for adults. I love the dried cranberries in this. I used vanilla rice krispies.

These came out too sticky for me but had good flavor. I suggest toasting the sesame seeds seperate from the other nuts, because they are so small they sit at the bottom of the pan and are harder to keep from getting over-cooked.

A healthy twist on the traditional rice krispy square. I replaced the nuts with pumpkin seeds. The result was delicious and attractive.

Awesome!  I used Cheerios instead of Rice Crispies but it came out great!  The toasted coconut, cranberries, etc. make it super delicious.  Very good idea to toast the ingredients, gives a much better flavor.  I also added double the peanut butter since my son is taking them hiking.  You have to work really fast since the marshmallow mixture sets up fast once you start putting the dry and wet ingredients together.

I made one and it seemed a little thin so let it set and spread crunchy peanut butter on top, then made another one and let that set on top. It turned out really well. I will make these again for sure. Super easy to do, though I had a hard time finding RAW sunflower seeds and unsweetened coconut flakes.

This was pretty good to me but a little on the dry side.  The rice krispies might need to be reduced to 3 cups.  It wasn't holding together well.  Will try again with the changes.

Great recipe as is. Toasting the seeds and coconut really made bars pop! I will make again.

I didn't have crispy rice cereal, but used rice chex cereal instead. I suspect that is why it came out way too sticky. Everything else was done per recipe instructions. I will try this again, though, since it was super delicious. I had regular sized marshmallows and converted the weight to Metric - and used about half a bag, by weight.  Thanks for an easy and tasty snack.
