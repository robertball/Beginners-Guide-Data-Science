I have always wanted to try making Alfredo sauce but it seemed more work then I wanted to do. On a whim I decided to check out Alfredo recipes for dinner tonight and found this one. I used Chicken, Broccoli, Red Peppers & Mushrooms. I also made extra Pasta. My husband & I loved it. My husband told me I out did myself with this meal. This was my first try and I can hardly wait to try it again with other vegetables. Maybe even use shrimp like others have suggested. Great recipe with so many options for personal touches.

It was okay, but not as tasty as I had hoped.

I just made this for tonights dinner and it is/was easy to make, yummy, and no scraps (always a good sign).The only change I made was I used Ro*tel Original (Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilis). This was because I  did not have any roasted Red Sweet Peppers. As a result, I believe my turned out a bit spicier than the original recipe-this is a good thing, as we like spicey/hot foods. Either way I plan on keeping this recipe easy to reach and would sugest trying it atleast once.
