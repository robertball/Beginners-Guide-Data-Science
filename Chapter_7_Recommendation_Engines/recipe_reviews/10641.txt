I have been making monster cookies for as long as I can remember.  I lost my traditional recipe and this one was as close as I can remember.  It worked out wonderfully and I will be using this from now on.  I always make these at Halloween and Christmas, using the seasonal colored M&M's.  I cut the recipe in half, using a cup of choc. chips and a cup of M&M's. From experience, I have learned you CAN put too much chocolate in them.  They get too sweet and you can't enjoy all of the different flavors.  Let the cookies cool on the pan for about 10 minutes before you move them to a wire rack to finish cooling.

I have used this recipe many times before and these are GREAT!  I divide the dough in 3 ways and I might add coconut in one, pecans in another and broken heath bar or raisins in the last but I alway use the M&M's and chocolate chips.   These are great frozen too.  If you need to feed a large group this is the cookie for you.

This is the best monster cookie recipe, I tried several but this one is chewy, peanut buttery and moist.  My husband is in the AF and he took a batch of these in to his night shift guys during Christmastime, I had to make a double batch days later as they had eaten them all and were demanding more. The oats filled them up and sustained them for their physical job. I made a few changes, I didnt use peanuts or the M&Ms and chocolate chips.  Instead I used mini chips and mini M&Ms, I just prefer how they disperse through the cookie. Next time I make them I will try some coconut for extra chewy goodness.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good but I scaled them down quite a bit. I've made monster cookies before, but used to them spreading out more. Used chunky peanut butter & omited the peanuts.

This is the original "classic"
recipe for Monster cookies that I grew up on.  They turned out great as usual!  I did add an extra cup of oats this time.
Cooking time in my oven was 15 minutes for moist chewy cookies.

I'm rating these for the taste, not their appearance. They are definitely not the prettiest cookie I've ever made, but the taste is perfect.  I would probably leave out the peanuts next time, the peanut butter was enough peanut taste for me.  I used a cookie scoop instead of forming the batter into balls with my hands, much less messy!  I will make these again.

These cookies were good - I did have one problem however, the test batch of these were way too runny and I had to add more oats to give the cookie any sort of shape (besides a flat blob). I also substituted peanut butter chips for M&M's because peanut butter chips were a dollar at the store and half as many M&M's were three dollars. The end product, with more oats, was wonderful and will be a big hit this Christmas!

I have made these a few times and have not reviewed them until now.  I usually cut the recipe in half and still have tons of cookies.  Quick and easy!  I let the KitchenAid do the mixing and these are a breeze.  I have made these with butter and also have used butter flavored crisco.  I like the texture of the cookies better using the butter flavored crisco, but very good cookies either way.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were delicious and fairly easy to make.  I used my handy, dandy cookie dropper instead of rolling them into balls.

These cookies are so yummy!  I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding peanuts.  Next time I am going to add some toasted slivered almonds.  These are one of my new favorite cookies.

I made a half batch following the directions exactly, other than using light margarine.  I also used honey nut peanut butter.  Very good cookies!  Super moist and chewy!

This recipe is awesome! I made it as written omitting the peanuts. We wanted monster-size cookies so we used the large Pampered Chef cookie scoop making well rounded scoops then mashing them down on the Pampered Chef stone, baked for 18 minutes, and let cool on the stone for several minutes before moving them to the wire rack.

I just made these cookies tonight and they taste great!!! The only differences is I added butterscotch chips to the recipe, but everything else stayed the same. This is the first cookie I have ever made from scratch and they came out great!! No need in changing the recipe. There were a few cookies that fell apart when I removed them from pan, but overall a job well done!!

Made recipe exactly as stated and had no problems. They tasted great but made a GIGANTIC batch so if you're not feeding an army I'd halve the recipe at least.

WOW!!!  I have made these two times, and both times people have raved about how good they are and asked for the recipie.  Chewy and moist, great combination of flavors.  I skipped the peanuts and added butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, M&M's, and heath toffee bits.  My son and his college friends couldn't stop eating them!

Great Cookie!  Made for Christmas cookie exchange and added mini-choco chips and red/green mini-M&Ms.  (minus peanuts in my batch)  Cookies looked festive and were a hit!

As it was my 1st try, I decided to cut down the recipe to a 45 servings. I omitted the sugar & reduced brown sugar slightly. Also, peanut butter was only about 70%. However, found that it was too runny, so I added 1/3 more portion of oats. Used white & brown chocolate chips which were ready in hand. Yielded about 60 pieces of cookies with about 5cm diameter each. Tasted perfect!

Yummy! I've made these twice now. The first time I followed the recipe but halved it and it still made a TON of cookies! The second time I made it, I made about 1/6 of a batch and it made about 2 dozen smallish cookies. I tried to make this a bit healthier so I used applesauce instead of the butter and they taste delicious still! I didn't add as much sugar as the recipe called for and I'm glad I didn't because the applesauce made the batter a bit sweet. I used dried banana chips instead of peanuts and the results were great! It created a yummy chocolate/banana/peanut butter cookie!

I don't know if it was something that I did, but these cookies spread so much that I couldn't get them off of the cookie sheet. I tried baking them longer but they turned out like pancakes. But, I have to say the cooked edges of the cookie were delicious. I finally added about 1 1/2 cups of flour to the remaining dough and the last half turned out much more edible. I will make this recipe again, but next time I'll add some flour.

OMG! This recipe rocks!  Crispy outside and chewy inside.  We went with the full 12 minutes for extra crunch.  Perfect match for making our 4th of July ice cream sandwich cookies.

excellent recipe.  i go ahead and mix the whole batch, but i don't bake it all at once.  i roll them into balls and freeze them until hard and put them into ziplock bags.  When i need a cookie fix, i bake a few.

I made as written and they were wonderful! These make a lot of cookies and they freeze well. I froze half and when I had company over, I would pull some out. Everyone loved them.

Delicious!  I love these cookies!  I usually make a half batch since a full batch makes so many cookies.

I make these cookies to send to one son in Iraq and the other at school in California.  As soon as the box hits the ground, they both get hit with requests to share.  The only changes I make is from another reviewer to use mini-chocolate chips and m&m's.

These cookies were excellent.. i didn't scale them down.. as I used the whole batch to bring to a Mom's club meeting for the month of December (review is a little late).. they were very delicious..and had a lot of texture... I made slight changes .. used mini chocolate chips and mini m&ms..and instead of nuts I used flaked coconut.. for some more chewy texture.. they were delicious

This is a great cookie!!!  I cut the recipe in half and got about 50 cookies using my 1/8 measuring cup to mold the cookies into the same size.  I used Old fashioned oats and Marantha Natural Peanut Butter which is the best IMHO (doesn't have any added sugar).  I didn't have M&M's so I did a mixture of 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup raisins.  I also added 1/2 cup unsweentened coconut with the 1/2 cup crushed peanuts. I read all the reviews and no one seemed to talk about how sweet the cookie was but next time I'll try to cut the sugar a little.  I definately needed some milk to cut the sweetness.  It may be my oven (I'm in a foreign country that doesn't do a whole lot of baking) so at the max time, my cookies were still a bit on the gooey side.  I cooked mine at 20 mins and they are crispy, chewy, and perfect!!!

This is a terrific recipe, however the first dozen turned out flat for some reason.  So I added one cup of four and one teaspoon of baking powder. This fluffed them up and stopped them from running all over :)

Maybe it was just user error, but I found the cookie dough to be a little too soupy, and it took 15 minutes to bake, not 10-12

This is a great recipe for monster cookies!  I took another readers suggestion and used crunchy peanut butter instead of peanut butter and peanuts.  They turned out great!

I normally don't write online reviews, but thought it only fair to post one since I rely so heavily on them.  This cookie was absolutely fantastic!  The only thing I changed was the addition of flaked coconut, which didn't add much taste, but adds a chewiness that makes this cookie out of this world!  I used to pay $4 for 8 of these at the local Amish market.  With as many cookies as this makes, it's like eating a gold mine!

These are great!  I don't think most people would guess that they don't have flour.  Quite addicting!  I didn't put in M&Ms because I didn'thave any, but I am sure that would have made them even better!  I made 1/2 the recipe, but that was still a lot of cookies!  I put the extras in the freezer, but they only lasted in there a week before they started losing quality. (They were still all eaten though.)  YUM!

can't wait to try this, I know it will be fantastic - someone gave this recipe to me years and years ago, exactly the same but without the peanuts, and it's always been a favorite.  Since I love peanuts, this can only be better!

These are awesome. I mixed wet ingredients in stand mixer for a couple minutes. And substituted pecans for the peanuts, and added about 1/2 finely shredded unsweetened coconut to the dry ingredients. Baked for 10-11 min and they were perfect! Everyone loves these!

I used to have a recipe much like this, but I lost it during one of our moves. It had butterscotch chips instead of peanuts, so I substituted. As far as I can tell, it tasted the same after the substitution. This is my favorite Monster Cookie Recipe. I know it makes a lot, but the dough can be frozen in logs for cutting and making cookies later. 

As for being too crumbly, I think the one that I used to use had a dozen eggs in it. The protein in the eggs would help hold the cookie together more. In a cookie recipe for 24 chocolate chip cookies, there is usually 2 eggs. So for a recipe this big, more eggs might help.

I started making this in 2009, but substituted Andy's Candies for the m&m's.  Also, when I use a 1" cookie scope (like a small ice cream scope) I end up with over 200 cookies that are a little on the small side, but when I roll the cookie balls with my hands I make them a little bigger than an inch, so it is a lot closer to 130.

I love this recipe. These taste exactly like my Grandmother's Monster Cookies. They crisp on the outside but stay chewy on the inside. I leave out the nuts like Grandma did, but sometimes Grandma would use peanut M&Ms instead of the regular. Delicious!

been making this recipe for 3 years now, big hit with everyone! did find the best way to keep them from being too sticky to spoon out on the cookie sheet and getting too flat when baking them is to first cool the dough in the fridge for a couple hours. then you can "mound" up the dough ball on the sheet to make a more thicker cookie. i have found too that i have to bake mine for 14 minutes. not sure if that is because i cool the dough first. i also dont use peanuts because my kids dont like big peanut chunks so i use chunky peanut butter. but yeah best cookie recipe i have ever made.

I halved the recipe since ii didn't have 9'cups of oats and it was plenty!  I also exchanged the nuts chips and candy for 2 cups (half recipe) of archer farms monster mix (from target) which included  nuts, candy, chic chips plus peanut butter chips and raisins.  They were delicious. The only issue I had is they spread a bit more than I thought they would.  I like thicker cookies. But they were still yummy.

These are everything that the reviews say chewy peanut buttery and delicious, and makes muy mucho cookies(Many cookies) . I made these on a whim after reading the great reviews I didn't have my butter room temp softened so I defrosted in microwave  and forgot to add it to the cookies, realized that the next morning, when I found the butter still in microwave..lol they were still good. But love butter so this morning I mixed in the softened butter OMG!!! So much more delicious, I also added festival colored mm&m's, the kids and the whole family loved these. Don't Over bake, will break if not cooled. .......Not the prettiest cookies, but so yummy.

I slashed the quantity of this recipe significantly from 132 servings to ~22. (My hubby and I don't need that many cookies!) It still turned out magnificently! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Awesome cookies!!! I have made these for Church functions, sleepovers and as after school treats! They are always gone in minutes! Only thing I did different was use large bag of M&M's. Must try!!!

I don't know what I did wrong--but these were a monstorous disaster! They spread out until they were flat as pancakes, didn't hold together well and were impossible to even get off the cookie sheet. However, I must have done something wrong... since everyone else gave this recipe such good reviews. :(

I ran out of oats so used 6 cups oats and 2-1/2 cups flour. Also added 7 oz bag of coconut and used 3 cups M&M's, no other chocolate or nuts.  I made mine 5-6 inches in diameter.  Rolled into a 2-3 inch ball and did not flatten them.  GREAT!

Very good but I felt they needed salt.  I added about 2 tsp. salt to the 1/2 batch I made.

I love these cookies!!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I only had 2 cups of peanut butter, so I added and extra 1/2 cup butter.  I added 1 1/4 cups flour and 1 tsp salt.  I did not have any peanuts, so I left them out.  I put them on the cookie sheet in large scoops (ice cream scoop size) and baked them about 11 minutes.  They were very good and soft and light!  Thanks for the recipe!   ps the dough was so good!!!

Loved these cookies. They were awesome. My dad has a wheat allergy so i make them mostly for him, but everyone else eats them too. My advice would be to undercook them just slightly. Also, These freeze well.

This was a fantastic recipe and sooo easy to make - can't believe I didn't have to use a mixer!  This is a versatile cookie that can have anything added to it - I used up my leftover mini-chocolate bars from halloween (smarties and crushed coffee crisps).  I cut the recipe to 1/3 and made 16 large cookies using an ice cream scoop.  Baked a little longer (18-20 mins) due to the size and they were still crispy and chewy the next day (they didn't last any longer than that!).
