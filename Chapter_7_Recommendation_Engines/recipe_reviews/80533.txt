The ingredient proportions are good except I did add some water to thin the batter a bit.  These were fabulously fluffy light pancakes and so healthy!  I even subbed all the flour for whole wheat!  I've never made a w.w. pancake this fluffy before.  I did add a little extra of the soda and powder.  I didn't have sour cream so used a 6 oz. container of f.f. blackberry yogurt I had hanging around.  I love the fact that this is high in fiber and very low fat...no butter or oil.  Sprayed the pan with Pam and used butter spray and some honey on top!  Filled me up on this rainy morning.  Wonderful recipe and great with the whole wheat flour in lieu of all-purpose.  If one doesn't like the batter that thick(it was more like a bread or muffin batter), just thin it with some water or milk to your liking.

I was actually looking for a waffle recipe that uses applesauce, and I ran across this particular pancake recipe.  I liked the idea that it also uses oatmeal (since I have a lot of it in my cupboard!)  I figured why not, I'll give it a try and make it into waffles.  My experiment was a success--nice, light waffles with a hint of cinnamon.  I doubled the recipe, and it made 4 full-sized waffles.  I baked them in my waffle iron for approximately 8-9 minutes each.  My husband gave them a thumbs up, too!

Who says a pancake has to be fluffy?  These are wonderful.  The batter is VERY thick and you have to kind of spread it in the pan.  They are heavy...but that works for us.  Two regular pancakes and I'm hungry by 10 a.m.  Two of these and I was full to noon!  Yummy too!  My 10 yr old son ate two of them on top of his breakfast cereal.  We will definately make these again!

We love 'em!!  Did 2/3 cup whole wheat flour, 2/3 cup oats ground up in food processor. Added rest of dry ingredients w/ a full tsp of cinnamon, pulsed couple more times to mix.  Used plain organic yogurt instead of sour cream & added 1/2 tsp liquid stevia to wet ingredients.  Added almost 1/2 cup diced walnuts.  Mixed dry ingredients into wet to make some really awsome & very healthy pancakes that were highly approved by my 20 mo' old, 3 yr. old & hubby.
UPDATE: made these again & instead of plain yogurt, I used 1/2 c of my homemade vanilla yogurt (32 oz plain organic yogurt mixed w/ 1 tsp stevia & 1 tsp vanilla).  Family said these were even better.  I serve them to my kids w/ a little raw organic butter & raw honey.  Always a big request!

These pancakes are great! They are my kids favorite. They are thick and filling. I make the batter the night before and stick it in the refridgerator. They cook up great the next morning.

Very tasty, hearty pancakes!  

I didn't have any regular oatmeal, so I subbed 2 packets of low sugar apple cinnamon instant oatmeal.  The packets had chunks of dried apples in them that were really good in the pancakes.  To compensate for the extra oatmeal, I upped the milk to 1/2 cup.  These are heavy pancakes and the batter is thick.  You will need to make sure that you cook them on medium heat to make sure they get done in the middle.  I browned mine nicely on both sides, but still had a few with 'raw' middles'.  I tossed them back into the skillet on low heat and finished cooking them through.  My toddler asked for seconds on them - so I will definitely make these again.

I made these today and they were really good! I had to make a double recipe, (I have 5 kids), my batter was perfect, not to thick, not to thin. I did add 1TBS. sugar per batch as per others suggestions and it was just right! Great flavor! You really have to cook these low and slow for them to cook all the way through and not burn, but they are worth the wait!
I really enjoyed these as did my family! We will make them again for sure!

These were really good--I liked the thickness and heartiness. They were, however, a little bland (and I prefer a sweeter pancake), so I added some Splenda and a pinch of salt. Next time will try with walnuts and/or almonds, and probably some diced apple. Yum!

These pancakes were delicious and tender. I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts (for some extra protein) and cooked them at a 300 degree setting on my electric griddle. Letting them rest under a cover after removal from the griddle, lets them finish cooking with the residual heat and ensures a cooked center.

I doubled this recipe. I ground my oats down in the mini food processor before using them in this recipe. I used whole wheat white flour, homemade applesauce and buttermilk instead of regular milk. These turned out well for me, though I wish they were a little fluffier. Next time, I think I'd add more baking powder--that's not a huge deal. We like a heartier pancake so we liked how filling they are. The flavor of them is really quite good. I topped them with my homemade "jam" (as in my jam didn't set up and I now have four pints of berry topping) and we loved it, especially my oldest. I think this would be good, too, if you were to sub plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, too. I might do that next time, too.

I loved these. I substituted 1/2 cup sour cream with 1/2 cup vanilla OIKOS greek yogurt and an extra 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. They came out really good. I topped them with real maple syrup and my family polished them off in minutes!! I suggest to keep your heat low, use a little cooking spray inbetween batches, and give these a little patience...I burned the first couple that I tossed on the griddle, but the rest came out great after I adjusted the heat.

Thinned it with a little water and made excellent waffles. I love it that it's so healthy and filling! The second time around I added 1 Tbls of agave syrup which sweetened it up a little. I think a little wheat germ would be good too. My kids loved it so it's a keeper.

This was just ok.  Of course, I didn't have any sour cream, so that would probably make a difference.  But it was pretty good with rhubarb sauce, and it was very filling.

These pancakes are AWESOME!  My wife, who doesn't EVER eat pancakes without syrup, enjoyed them plain as day!  I did make a couple of minor modifications.  I used 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1/2, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and added about a 1/2 c. of Splenda to sweeten them up.  SOOO good!

These were not that great, pretty bland and I even used sweetened applesauce. I had to add an extra  1/3 cup milk and they were still really thick and hearty. Not sure I'd bother with these again.

These pancakes are great! My only substitutions were whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour since I had it on hand, and plain yogurt for the sour cream because that's what I had. I liked that the batter was thick; used a 1/4 cup disher to scoop up and also pat down/spread out the batter. Since there is no sugar added to the pancakes, I used pomegranate jelly as a topping and thought they were perfect.

I do not process flour very well, but I LOVE oatmeal!  I put ONE cup oatmeal in the blender and not quite powdered it, added 1/2 cup flour, then followed the rest of the recipe, adding milk last to get the right consistency.  I loved them! More importantly, so did my stomach!

I haven't made these yet, but a glaringly missing ingredient is salt.  Just 1/2 tsp of kosher salt will make all the difference in the world to the flavor of this recipe.

I have a one year old whom I try to fix healthy meals for.  This one sounded wonderful.  I did modify mine a little.  I used 1 packet of maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal in place of the quick cooking oats (not so healthy I suppose), 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon (we LOVE cinnamon and would add more next time), and 2 tsps vanilla (LOVE this too).  They were wonderful!!  They smelled fantastic while they were on the griddle!  I set my electric griddle at around 325 and they had to cook for quite a while so they weren't doughy.  They were still moist from the applesauce, but perfectly so!   LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!!  Will definitely make again and maybe try other instant oatmeal packets to change up the flavor.  BTW, this made 11 for me, using 1/4 cup batter for each.  My little one ate 2 whole pancakes!

These pancakes have some incredible flavor.  I did make a few changes though, and they turned out wonderful.  They weren't too thick and were nice and fluffy.
First I substituted the all purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour, just to make them more healthy.  Next I added 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt.  And lastly I used 1/2 cup of buttermilk instead of the sour cream. They were delicious! Thanks for the recipe.  It will be a new staple in our home.

This was really good with a few changes. I added one chopped apple, some chopped walnuts, a tablespoon of sugar and an extra dash of cinnamon.  I could see adding a little bit of salt next time too to balance the sweetness.  Overall very good, family loved it!

I didn't have applesauce, used a 6 oz. container of Tillamook peach yogurt and added enough milk to make the consistency of thick pancake batter. These were very popular with my kids!

Great recipe for waffles! I did add a little extra baking powder, baking soda and a little more milk as one of the reviews suggested. I did use a tropical yogurt that tasted like Pina colada instead of the sour cream. They tasted amazing! My Niece & Nephew said they were the best waffles they ever had!

Great!  Don't make the pancakes too big or they will fall apart as you try to turn them.  They stay nice and moist inside though!  I took the advice of the other posters and use 2/3 oats, 2/3 whole wheat flour (blended the oats a little bit) and used a little extra milk to thin the batter.  Forgot the vanilla by accident!  But it was great.  Added a chopped apple too.  Yum!

These are okay, but a little bland, and the texture wasn't to my liking. I'll be making other pancake recipes in the future.

Thank goodness I doubled this recipe because my 4 young sons DEVOURED these!  I only made 2 significant changes to this recipe:  I added 1 T. ground flaxseed meal and 1/4 cup packed brown sugar (that was for my doubled amount).  I also used "Coaches Oats" from Costco since I never buy quick oats.  I pulsed them a few times in my processeor to ensure they wouldn't be crunchy, and even with these minor changes they were EXCELLENT.  Dense, moist, awesome!  We served with maple syrup, but next time I'm gonna make my buttermilk syrup to go with.  Either way, you can't go wrong with these!  Thanks for sharing!

Am giving five stars because our grandchild asked for them again today after eating yesterday! Cut in half and used whole grain flour in place of all purpose and plain yogurt in place of sour cream.  Also ground up the oatmeal in the mini food processor.  Because used whole egg in half the recipe, did not add milk, as it was moist enough.  Also used all the cinnamon, baking powder and soda and added nutmeg.

I have tried a lot of pancake recipes, and this one is so for my fav. Loved everything about it. The only thing I added was chocolate chips. Pancakes are not pancakes without chocolate chips!!!

These are wonderful pancakes.  Very filling, nutritious, and flavorful.  Thank you, thank you, thank you! They were a huge hit with the kids.  This morning I ran out of applesauce so I use apple butter for 1/2 c.  WOW - did that go over well.  Im sure that killed some of the nutritional value but that was YUMMY!  I also used stone cut oats instead of quick cooking oaks and they were still soft and amazing.

Not bad - just won't be my "go to" recipe for pancakes.  We all agreed that a plain old pancake with some wild Maine blueberries tossed in the batter is far better than these.

These were really good from scratch pancakes. I adjusted the recipe though using only 2/3cup 100% whole wheat flour so they weren't so thick, used an entire cup of applesauce, used fat free plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, used an extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder and a little extra baking soda(as another review suggested), and added ground flaxseed. The oatmeal really stands out and tastes great. Perfect amount of sweetness and just the right amount of dense/fluffiness.

Sorry, but these did NOT go over well at our house!  I made them exactly as stated.  Besides the slight gumminess, they were just SO bland.  I guess this is supposed to be a "healthy" pancake, but you can have a tasty, healthy pancake!  We love the Nut and Grain Pancake recipe from this site.  I hate to give negative reviews, but this one just won't be made again here!

I have never had a problem with any recipe rated this high on this website.  This one I just could not get to work.  No matter what I did they would not cook all the way through.  I tried lower heat for a longer time and thining it out. Nothing worked.  I would not do this recipe again.

Simple to make, but delicious. I used whole wheat flour, which turned out really good. I also cut it down to three servings, which called for 1/2 an egg…I may have had a little more / less egg in there. Tastes great, holds together really well, and it's quicker than you'd think.

I used the recipe to make waffles. It worked very well, but the dough was too stiff, so I increased the milk to 1/2c (it was almond milk in my case). I also used greek nonfat yougurt instead of the sour cream. I cooked pancakes too. It works just as well. Thanks!

These are extremely hearty pancakes.  The batter is very thick and I had to spoon it around to make it spread.  As a result, they take a little longer to cook than other pancakes.  I didn't have milk so subbed apple juice instead, but it didn't thin it out or change anything that I could tell.  These are good topped with cooked apples--I made the Toasted Apple-Pecan Brie Sandwiches from here yesterday and didn't use all the topping, and it was pretty good on top of these pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

So disappointing.  They were uncooked in the middle, even after cooking for a long time.  We had to slice them in half and cook them again!  WE dubbed them "refried pancakes."

I kinda hodge podged this recipe since I only had half a cup of sweetened applesause. I reduced the sour cream to 1/3 cup and added an additional 1/4 tsp vanilla plus 3 tbsp of milk since the batter was really thick. The pancakes turned out amazing!! Next time I hope to get crazy and try whole wheat flower and have the right amount of apple sauce. My 19 mo son loved them!!

Very good.  To feed 6 with good appetites, double the recipe.  As a variation, cut the applesauce by half, add one diced apple, and add more milk.

I gave them 3 stars but my other half and son gave them 4start - they really liked them.  For me, it was the the taste.  I don't have a sweet thooth and even I found these really lacking some sweetness.  Maybe sweetened applesauce would have been better. Don't think I'd make again.

I added one tablespoon sugar and doubled the amount of cinnamon called for and still found these to be rather bland.  They also took forever and a day to cook.  I don't have a griddle so used a couple frying pans,  Don't know if that was part of the problem, but it took close to a half hour and some were still mushy and raw-tasting in the middle.  Definitely not worth the hassle in my opinion.

Never made pancakes this fluffy before!!  I used WW flour, added 1/4 cup oat bran and 1/4 cup wheat germ.  Used apple flavor yogurt instead of sour cream and egg substitute.  Also doubled the recipe because they were eaten so fast!

Loved the taste, texture... couldn't ask for a better tasting pancake.  Even my 21 month old son ate 3 pancakes for breakfast and wanted more.  He's at the stage where he doesn't want anything except milk, graham crackers and oatmeal so this was great!

Delicious!  My 21 month old picky-eater ate a entire pancake.  I didn't have any sour cream so based on other reviews, I used a cup of buttermilk (1tbsp lemonjuice + 1cup milk) instead. Added a tbsp of sugar and increased baking powder to 1.5 tsp.  Oh and a 1/2 tsp of salt and a 1/2 cup of raisins.  Definitely a keeper!  I used a non-stick fying pan, so didn't need to use any oil either.

Delicious! They were very sweet and VERY filling. I did use 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1/3, to lighten up the batter a bit -- but that was the only change. Will definitely make this again.

These were really good.  Everyone loved them.  I did add about a 1/2 cup extra oatmeal and extra baking soda and powder.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  I let the batter sit in the fridge for about half an hour and then thinned out the batter with a bit more milk, but it was still thick.  This only about 9 pancakes, but they were so filling that you only need to eat two.

These pancakes are a hit in my family, especially with my 4 and 5 year old. They are very filling so they're great not only at breakfast time but also for lunch. Some said the recipe was not sweet enough, I disagree. If you're not a sugar lover make the recipe as is. The applesauce gives them a really nice flavor. I also used a blend of white and whole wheat flour.

These are really good and surprisingly sweet enough for a pancake. I usually like light and fluffy pankcakes but these are great because you feel like you're actually eating something. I used homemade applesauce, it was sweetened slightly before jarring but it was chunky so I got little chunks here and there. Make sure your griddle is completely up to heat, i thought mine was and it wasn't because the first two were really thick and got brown before they fully cooked through, but the rest were fluffy.

I made these this morning for breakfast. As it turned out I didn't have any sour cream so I ended up using strawberry yogurt.  We had 1 lonely banana on the counter which is a fight waiting to happen in a house with 6 kids so sliced and in the batter it went......YUMMY.  The kids used maple syrup but I liked them with some strawberry yogurt.  The best part is that they are filling so I'm not spending my morning cooking pancake after pancake.  I can make half as many and the kids leave the table full.   This is now going to best our Sunday morning treat(a few times a week because I really like them too.)

Very moist and thick pancakes.  My 3 year old really liked them.  They lacked a bit of sweetness to them but overall they were great.  I'll make them again in the future.

These were very good - once again a thumbs up from my 6 year old since she did not know there was sour cream in them.  I should have read the reviews, though, and I would not have doubled the batch!!  Also I had no quick oats, so I used Apples and Cinnamon instant packs instead.  One pack is about 1/3 c.

These were great.  The whole family enjoyed them.  I wouldn't quite agree that they filled me up ALL morning, but they tasted great, and it's always a good thing to add a bit of oatmeal here and there where you can.  I discovered we were out of milk and used some powdered milk and water to substitute; they turned out fine.

Well, this was my first ever made form scratch pancake. So, from reading other reviews I'd say they turned out exactly as they were supposed to.They were very hearty and filling but a little bland.

I was excited to find a "heathly" pancake, but my 4 yr old and hubby were not fans of them at all.  I thought they tasted fine and my 2 yr old was fine with them...I did food process the oatmeal to make a smoother texture.  I would omit the cinnamon next time.

These have great flavor, and I like the fact that they are healthy pancakes.  I found, though, that it was hard to cook them all the way through without overcooking the outside.  In the end, I did not like the consistency of the pancakes.

I'll stick with the "old fashioned" recipes.  These did not seem "done" to me, no matter how long I cooked or how thin I made the batter.  Too bad, the recipe was intriguing.

I substituted yogurt for the sour cream, cinnamon spice instant oatmeal for the quick oats, and added an additional 1/3 cup of milk.  One recipe makes nine six-inch pancakes.  This recipe was a hit with my family.  These pancakes are very hearty…we ended up eating a little more than half the amount we would have eaten with traditional pancakes, and everyone was stuffed.

Great recipe. I made it a banana pancake recipe.  What I changed: I used only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and added extra milk at the end to make the pancakes a little less thick.  One day I did not have applesauce, so I substituted 2 mashed bananas. They were awesome!  My husband doesn't want me to make them any other way now.

These are very, very good.  Have a very nice apples with cinnamon flavor.  I added 3 tbsp of ground flax (I add it to everything) and they came out wonderful.  I did add an extra tsp of baking powder, but I like mine fluffy :)  I plan on trying to sub in other veggies/fruits for the applesauce as this recipe seems very easy to switch around.  I love these and my kids did too!!  They also freeze well.

These are great!  I used whole wheat flour, 2 eggs, a little extra milk, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  I have also substituted ripe bananas for part of the applesauce and plan on trying pumpkin too.  Thanks - these are the best according to my kids!

Great pancakes...I made a couple of changes...i used 1/2 c of oat flour, 1/2 c of white flour...I added a little bit of sugar as others suggested and used coconut milk instead of regular milk.  They were sooo good! I will definitley be making these again!

I loved this recipe.  I used regular sour cream and sweetened applesauce because that's all I had and I added a little brown sugar, but other than that I followed the recipe.  My kids loved them and didn't even want syrup!!  That's when you know it's a good pancake, when you don't have to smother it in syrup!!!  It tasted fantastic all by itself!!! Thanks!!!

These are the best pancakes I've ever had!  I did not have problems getting them to cook through as others did.  In fact, I thought mine got cooked pretty evenly, although they did not burn at all. I cooked them over medium-low heat.

My family loved these pancakes! I did make a few alterations---1/2 the flour I used whole wheat and also added a couple Tablespoons of wheat germ. I didn't have sourcream, so I subsituted with yogurt. They were very heavy but moist and delicious on the inside! Very filling! Thanks so much...this one is going in my recipe box!

The only substitution I made to this recipe was using buttermilk instead of plain milk.  Everything else was done as directed.  Delicious results.  Light, fluffy, and moist.  Would definately use again.  Granddaughter loved them...daughter too!!!!

OH. MY. Goodness.  The best pancakes I have ever had.  I used my raspberry-flavoured applesauce ... WOW!  ps. You can substitute some yogourt and milk for the sour cream if you haven't got any :)

These were very good.  Tasted like apple cinnamon pancakes.  They were very thick, but fluffy at the same time.  After making the first one, I thinned the batter out with some water and it helped.  They were still fluffy just not as heavy.

I found these bland and hard to get cooked all the way through, you really have to cook them low and slow (even then it's tough).  My 16 month old usually loves pancakes and wouldn't eat them.

Very good and very filling!  If you like your pancakes a little less dense, add milk until you achieve the desired consistency.

These were really tasty.  I served them with apple-cinnamon syrup from this site which made the pancakes over-the-top delicious.  The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of brown sugar, a personal preference.  I agree with other reviews that these should be cooked on fairly low heat to make sure they cook completely because the batter is quite thick.

I tried to like these. I really did. And I cooked them on verrrrrrry low and they still only burnt on the outside and never cooked in the inside. I'll make myself eat the rest and then will toss the recipe.

These are the BEST pancakes I have EVER had in my WHOLE life!  I did add a couple of handfuls of blueberries to the batter, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will DEFINITELY make again, and I plan to make them for the rest of my life.

GREAT pancakes! What I did differently: added 3/4 tablespoon cinnamon, couple pinches of nutmeg and 3 tablespoons of organic cane sugar. Also- used 1/2 cup of cottage cheese (that was smushed a bit extra with a fork to minimize the lumpy-ness) in place of sour cream (didn't have any). Even with this change, they were wonderfully hearty and moist. Will definitely make again- with Stonyfield organic maple yogurt and walnuts. mmmm.

Very good! I didn't have the sour cream so I substituted yogurt, a little vanilla and little strawberry banana.  Very tasty.  Definitely need to spread the batter out.

Very tasty!  These will become a staple in our breakfast repetoire because it is a great way to 1) use up applesauce and 2) to get a good dose of oatmeal.  I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and increased the amount of cinnamon.  Yummy!  I also made a batch to freeze, because it is good for a quick breakfast.  Pop one out of the freezer, toast or microwave, slather on a bit of peanut butter and you're out the door!

Very good! I doubled this and added 2 T of sugar, extra cinnamon and the nutmeg. I thought they were thick, meaning cook time was longer, but they were pretty light.  

Everyone loved them in my house--big pancake eaters. I also love the fact that I can get in oatmeal and applesauce.

You do have to cook these longer and at a lower heat than regular pancakes.  It's a nice change though.  You can really taste the oats and applesauce and they smell great when cooking.  Good flavor and very hearty.

boo hoo to all the naysayers, who complained about the raw pancakes. my husband loved them. the added sugar, an extra 1/2 teas. of baking soda, a little buttermilk to thin them, and make them silver dollar size. cook them a little longer, lower heat, turn carefully, after bubbles show over the whole pancake, check center with toothpick, if it comes out clean, breakfast is served. thanks for this great recipe.

Thanks, I am going to try and make these. Just a word of advice on the fluffiness...if  you add seltzer water to them it will fluffen them up.  I do it with my regular pancakes all the time and it makes a world of a difference!

We love these pancakes and make them all the time! Instead of the sour cream, I use a single serving of yogurt. I add 2 previously frozen mashed bananas and a 3/4   cup of frozen mixed berries. I leave out the vanilla and use cinnamon and nutmeg isntead.

These are very thick but were good. I added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and a 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten it up.  The middles were a bit raw and it seemed I couldn't get them cooked throughly without burning them.

I am a huge fan of "Aunt Jemima" for her boxed pancake mix-most other pancakes just don't compare.. But, these were pretty good. We topped em w/ Columia Empire Farms triple berry jelly & they were awesome! I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a pancake fan but I LOVE these. They were satisfying and felt healthy as I was eating them. Fluffy and substantial at the same time. The spouse found them "fascinating" and good to eat. We had them with the  carmelized apples with no syrup required. And oh yes, I am flip -challenged and these were so easy to turn.

I love this healthy pancake recipe. I substituted buttermilk for the milk, so used 3/4 tsp if baking soda and only 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Also added a dash of salt. These are the pancakes that my husband asks for! Oh yes, make sure to spritz your griddle with oil too.

We  prefer waffles to pancakes, and that is the only change made to this recipe. It was flavorful, filling, & fun to make. My husband (who thinks oatmeal in a bowl is a form of punishment), asked for a second helping. Next time I’ll throw in a banana or two"

Very tasty and moist! I substituted yogurt for the sour cream and they turned out fine. I love that they're low in fat and sodium compared to many other pancake recipes!

First time making.  I put more batter in than was suppose to.  Was too thick and didn't cook thoroughly. Second time used 1/4 cup and spread out evenly in pan.  Much better!  Will probably make again.

I was liberal in my measurements of the moist ingredients (and used egg  beater instead of whole egg).  I also used a mix of whole wheat and white flour, doubled the cinnamon and used Vietnamese cinnamon.  These were terrific!  Family loved them.  Thanks for a great, healthy recipe!

Wanted something to do with the not so great homemade applesauce someone gave us, so we tried these.. I was really worried because the batter tasted kinda gross. The pancakes turned out FANTASTIC though!! The whole family loved loved loved them!

This recipe makes up quickly.  I had left over applesauce so thought I would try this.  I needed to sub in regular oatmeal and greek yogurt.  Delicious!

Delicious.  I loved the texture.  Liana liked but not as much as the Fluffy Pancakes in AllRecipes that I usually make.  I added a slightly rounded T. of sugar and a rounded 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Also a bit extra on the baking powder and soda (just a little) as suggested by someone.

Made these this morning, for the second time...delicious!  Had no sour cream but last time I used fat-free Greek yogurt and today used milk, still very good.  Doubling recipe for two to four made adequate portion size for two adults, only 267 calories each.  A staple recipe in my house!??

I made it exactly to the recipe and these were easily the best pancakes I've ever made. Granted, I love oatmeal. I super love oatmeal. I like the suggestions of using buttermilk in place of milk, yogurt in place of sour cream, and cooking on low to medium heat to make sure you don't get raw middles. I'll definitely play around with the recipe a little, just for fun. I served with maple syrup, but will probably make baked cinnamon apples to put on top next time. A little applesauce or yogurt would go well on top, also. I was completely satisfied after two pancakes, even though I'm usually a pretty big eater.

These were good - more like a flat muffin than a pancake.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose.  Next time, I may try kefir instead of sour cream and up the oats to 1/2 cup (I used old fashioned).  I might even add some diced apple.  Overall I enjoyed them - I love that there was no added sugar.

The only things I did differently was to do 2/3 cup, (instead of 1/3 cup) milk as I found the batter to be just too thick otherwise. As well, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, (less calories). The flavour was among the BEST I've ever tasted in pancakes or waffles. A GREAT breakfast dish!!!!

This was a very easy and good pancake recipe. They were very moist. I added a little brown sugar to make them a little sweeter. I will be sure to make these again. My 4 year old daughter even liked them.

I thought they tasted okay, but it took forever for them to cook on low heat so they wouldn't burn.  My husband, 2 year old and 10.5 month enjoyed them, so it was worth the effort.

as per other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1 tbsp. brown sugar because we like our pancakes sweet-ish.  I also accidentally added a 1/2 cup of oatmeal instead of the 1/3 cup, but it still tasted really great (I just added some extra milk so it wasn't super thick).  It does take some patience to cook though - had to spread out the batter on the pan and cook on medium-low heat.  Would make again when I have time, perhaps with some fruit chunks (i.e. apple/banana/blueberry) added in too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Happy we tried but won't be making it again. The pancakes tasted good but the texture wasn't right. Some people described the pancakes as fluffy... we describe them as uncooked (no matter how long we cooked them).

I love oatmeal and I love applesauce so I couldn't wait to try these but I thought they were very bland.  Granted, I did not have sour cream so I substituted 1/2 c light vanilla yogurt and also added extra cinn, but still very bland.  FYI - they are also very dense and take a while to cook.

I made these pancakes this morning and they were not very good at all.  My family could barely finish one.  These took along time to cook.  But they never did seem to get cooked all the way through.  I would never make these again.

Just made these for supper tonight and our family of 4 gave it 8 thumbs up!  As other readers suggested, I thinned the batter a little with some extra skim milk and I used 1/2 all-purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  This will be in regular roatation at our table and I don't think I'll ever buy packaged pancake mix again.

This is the first review I've written, and I've used dozens of this website's recipes! These were soooo good! I didn't have sour cream, so just added more milk (we use soy) to get the consistency I wanted. I have three very picky toddlers, and they loved them - could not get enough! And I like the fact that they are healthy as well.

Seems like everyone who liked this recipe added lots of different things it didn't call for. I did not really like the taste and the pancake was way too gooey. I tried cooking it for longer on a lower heat and it still was too wet in the middle. I will not make these again,

We just made these pancakes and my husband and my kids all loved them.  We didn't have any sour cream in the house so we ended up using vanilla yogurt and skipping the sour cream and vanilla the recipe was calling for.  We used frozen berries to serve with them and they were delicious!  We will be making them again!

We love it!  Didn't have sour cream so we used nonfat plain yogurt instead.  The pancakes were moist and tasty.  We're  big fans of my husband's homemade buttermilk pancakes but these were just as good!

Easy enough to make, I felt like these did have a nice fluffiness to them but lacked in flavor. To spice it up, next time I'll use chunky applesauce or diced up my own apples, and add banana puree too!

I agree with the reviewer that said that these never seemed done.  Two of my kids commented that the middles tasted gooey.  I added blueberries to mine, so this was not as noticeable.  We have pancakes every Wednesday and have tried better recipes.  I may try tweaking this one, but probably will not make again as written.

Pretty good. Not the best pancakes I have had but they're decent. Maybe add fresh cut apple chunks next time or a little brown sugar. It was definitely missing something.

Not bad. Not great. No sugar or salt are called for in this recipe, which I didn't really even realize until I sat down to eat them. Pretty noticeable! We wound up using salted butter (which we wouldn't normally add butter to our pancakes) and using a few extra squirts of pancake syrup. I did add a bit more milk to mine to thin out the batter as I hate super thick pancake batter (harder for me to judge doneness accurately) but that was an easy fix for preference only. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I add blueberries and bananas and to gives it an extra kick.  I also thin the batter with extra water.

delicous moist and the best most unique recipe I've tried. Who would have thought to put sour cream? They cook quick so watch that they don't burn. Picture doesn't do justice. They look better than that! If u omit the vanilla extract they still taste great! Big hit with my family!

These were wonderful!  My 3 and 1 year olds loved them, as did I!  I only made a half recipe, but used one whole egg, creme fraiche instead of sour cream, and 1/2 ww flour.  I think using double the eggs made them much fluffier.  They weren't very heavy. I did find that cooking them slightly longer and not so hot, maybe around medium heat, did the job, They were still moist in the center, but not undercooked. We will definitely make them again!

Easy, healthy, low fat.  Very tasty, but you do have to be a little more patient when cooking these or else they will be mooshy in the middle. Very much worth the wait!

Very moist! Be sure to poke a slit in each one with the edge of the spatula when you flip them over. It will help release the steam so the inside gets cooked instead of staying gummy.  I added blueberries, which turned out great.

These were fantastic. Like other reviewers, even my son liked them! They were very moist , so delicious! The changes I made were that I added about 2 tbsp of sugar, had only a spoonful of sour cream- so I added more milk, added a little water to thin the batter, added a pinch of salt, 1 small apple and abot 1/4c of chopped walnuts. We topped them with peach pie filling, YUM!

These were absolutely wonderful!! Our new family pancake recipe! My husband was diagnosed with high cholesterol this week, so I have been looking for ways to adjust my cooking accordingly... these are perfect!! I did make a few changes, used cinnamon sweetened applesauce and only a 5th c skim milk and another 5th water. These taste wonderful and they were so filling, but not in a bloating way!! Hubby loved them, my two year old loved them, and I (not a big fan of pancakes) also loved them!!! One of my new faves!

My husband and i loved this recipe, he is usually really picky with "Healthy Foods" because of the taste but loved these. The only substitutions i made were by mistake, i ended up using 10 grain pancake mix instead of flour, it turned out surprisingly good. Will definitely make again.

I was pretty disappointed with these. Following the advice of one reviewer, I cooked the first batch low and slow. . .20 min later they still weren't done. So the second time around I cooked them as I do normal pancakes and they still did not cook through. Maybe I did something wrong, I don't know. My 3 year old (who eats anything and everything) told me they didn't taste good. I won't be making these again.

I really liked these pancakes. They weren't lying when they say in the description that they're moist pancakes, because they are very moist. They have a good flavor and are quite tasty.

This was wonderful.  The pancakes were light and fluffy.  I used the whole wheat flour, a little extra milk,baking soda and baking powder. I added honey on top with the butter spray.  I will definitely make it again. Thanks.

These were pretty good! And the kids loved them. I did make some changes though; I used 2/3 unbleached and 1/3 whole wheat flour, swapped out the sour cream for vanilla yogurt, went from 1tsp to 1 tablespoon of spice (which ended up being cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice because I ran out of cinnamon), and I threw in a few hand fulls of raisins to sneak in some iron. delicious! I'll be posting pics later.

Love this recipe! Very healthy.  I also subsititued abuot 1/4 cup yogurt and 2 TBSP of sourcream. The batter was a bit thick and I used about 1/4 cup water to thin a bit.  I used "Sarah's homemade Applesauce recipe" and used that as the applesauce and also on top instead of butter or syrup.  Delicious!

These were good!  I did set the electric griddle at 325 degrees so the inside could cook.  Next time (based on some other reviews) I will do ½ whole wheat flour and ½ regular, add some nutmeg and use 1 cup of applesauce to thin it out a little.  It would probably help to let it sit 30 minutes or overnight to let the liquid fully absorb.

Great recipe. The pancakes came out very fluffy. I changed half of the flour to whole wheat and used yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added 1 Tbsp. of maple syrup to taste.

We love these pancakes.  They are perfect for fall.  They aren't real sweet but then again I'm not into pancakes that are too sweet, so I love these.

These were delicious! I also added some Splenda & upped the cinn to 1 tsp. I used oat flour for the oats & increased the milk to 1/2 cup. I used light sour cream (all I had) & it worked fine. These were thick & hearty. Thank you for sharing!
