Everyone really enjoyed the texture and flavor of these cookies.  I agree with the previous reviews regarding the cardamom-I doubled the amount to 1/2 tsp.

A yummy cookie, but I am personally very heavy-handed with my spices, and I enjoy more flavorful cookies. This recipe did not call for nearly enough cardamom.  You can barely taste it, with all the other flavors competing with it.  When I make it next time, I will definitely increase the amount of cardamom, but nevertheless, the cookies were delicious!  The lemon was a nice touch.

This is a very tasty and delicious cookie.  It is soft and cakelike in texture, and is delicious for dunking in milk, coffee, or tea.  It is an adult tasting cookie, being that it is plain and all of the flavor comes from the simple ingredients.  Very easy to make and very yummy.

Good! Not quite as prominent of an almond flavor as I was hoping for, but still yummy. I'd probably add a little almond extract in there next time, but I really love almond, sooo... :) Thanks!!

MMMMmmmmmmm! A nice scandinavian tasting cookie! I added raisins to my cookies, because I like them in cardamom bread (Pulla in Finnish) Melt in your mouth!

Used as a template for 5 Spice cookies. Worked perfect!
Instead of almond and cardamom, substitute 1/2 tsp Chinese 5 Spice. I omitted the lemon zest as well. Coat dough balls with turbinado sugar and bake. Delicious!

These are very good cookies, great soft texture. I definitely would add more cardamom next time, and maybe even more lemon zest.

Yummy and fluffy. Very mild. When I make them again I will do as others suggested and bump up the cardamom and lemon.

I heavily doctored this recipe by adding ground almonds that were left over from making almond milk. They turned out really well.

My Norwegian grandma used to make almond cake and cardamom/lemon krumkake. With a bit of extra cardamom, these were a perfect fusion of the two. These look cake like but they are more dense (if you've ever baked with almond flour you'll know what I mean). Keep a close eye on them because almond tends to brown/burn quickly. Mine didn't look quite done when I pulled them out but were fairly brown on the bottom. They continued to cook a bit while cooling and turned out well. If you don't want a puffy cookie, chill the dough, roll into balls and flatten.

I love these cookies, but I used a full teaspoon of cardamom and a tablespoon of vanilla. They are very soft and my coworkers love them.

Delicious! Made these for a Norwegian gathering and they disappeared!  I did double the cardamom and Lemon zest. Use a small scoop and they turn out looking beautiful (I also substituted almond flavoring for the paste once and it turned out just fine)

Delicious!  Soft and sweet, with a slight cardamon flavor.  Quick and easy to make.  I used orange zest, as I didn't have a lemon on hand.  This will be one of my go to sugar cookie variations.

The texture was very good . Since I love cardamom I increased the amount from 1/4 t. to 1 t. I didn't have lemon zest.

I found that you had to watch the cookies rather closely because they get brown all of a sudden. However, the taste was still good.

I will make them again.
