I used brown sugar-maple oatmeal for the whole grain cereal and lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk. As with most pancakes with oatmeal, I usually let it sit for 15 minutes or more so the oatmeal has a chance to soak up some of the liquid and puff up. I wisked the dry ingredients together, then added the combined wet ingredients and gently folded it into the dry until just moistened. Very good. I served this with butter pecan syrup and bacon. The kids and I really liked this. NOTE: This recipe made quite a bit, so I froze them in two's for busy mornings. All I have to do is throw them in the microwave.

These are delicious!  Made them 2 days in a row!  One time, I used 10 grain cereal for the crunch, the other time, I used oatmeal.  The pecans add a nice taste and texture.  I subbed honey for the sugar, and that is wonderful!

These are great, and I love how healthy they are! I've made them a few times now, using plain Greek yogurt, which bumps up the protein/calcium content. Also add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to accentuate the pumpkin/fall flavors. I also go with chopped walnuts, since they've got more protein and Omega-3s than pecans.

mmmmm.. soo good! These are super filling and stick with you for awhile, but so very tasty! The first day I made them I put a little pumpkin pie spice in some sugar and sprinkled them with it... and the next day when I used the rest I put some fresh whipped cream over the top and we had them for dessert!! : ) I added some ground flax seeds in place of 1/2 cup ww flour but otherwise followed the recipe. Thanks it was exactly what I wanted them to be! : )

For those who substitute things, please note that acidity level in pancakes affects the rise of the soda. So buttermilk will give more lift than yogurt, and milk none at all. Also if you sub oatmeal you should grind it a bit in a blender or food processor. Letting the batter rest is wise. And I agree, this needs a bit of oil or butter in the batter, some spice and half the vanilla.

Served these with the Apple Cider Syrup from "Pumpkin Waffles with Apple Cider Syrup By: JEANETTE B" on this site. Excellent choice for a chilly fall morning. I used walnuts instead of pecans,  brown sugar instead of white, cutting back to a quarter cup. I used fresh baked pureed pumpkin, not canned.  Next time I will add a teaspoon or 2 of pumpkin pie spices. These are heavy and solid, maybe a Tbsp or two of oil or melted butter might help to make these a little lighter.

I was disappointed with these pancakes.  They were too thick, hard to turn and weren't as flavorful as I expected.  The only substitution I had to make was using oatmeal for the multigrain hot cereal.  It seems like it should have some type of oil.  I would rate this two stars for being edible but will not make again.  Maybe the oatmeal affected the texture, so I ranked this three stars.

I used more flour and no cereal, 15 oz of pumpkin and 8 oz of vanilla yorgurt, soy milk rather than whole milk and only enough to thin down the batter, not 1 cup. Not as fluffy as regular pancakes but certainly much healthier and tasty too.

I loved these pancakes and I'm not a pancake lover. I think what made them so much better than regular pancakes, in my opinion, is that I knew I was eating something healthy that tasted great too. I added nutmeg and cinnamon.

Sorry, I didn't care for these. I followed the directions without modification and they came out much too thick and bland. I ended up adding about 3/4 cup more milk and 1/4 tsp cinnamon in an attempt to salvage breakfast but neither of us cared for them . Too much vanilla for my tastes. I much prefer "Grain and Nut Whole Wheat Pancakes" on this site.

These pancakes were really good. I added a bit more almond milk. Instead of the ww pastry flour I used half freshly ground white wheat flour and half kamut flour. I also used fresh pureed pumpkin and less vanilla. I used half the recommended sugar and used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar added a bit of stevia. I chopped the pecan in a small food processor. They tasted really good and were filling. My husband and toddler liked them a lot.

These pancackes have a lot of texture thanks to pecans and hot cereal. I used non-fat greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and 1/4c agave syrup. The dough is thick. I'd add some pumpkin pie spice or cnnamon to improve the flavor.

These were good, thick, hearty pancakes. A little milk could be added if you don't like really thick pancakes, but they were such a nice change from the lighter, fluffier kind. I used brown sugar and cut the amount by about half so that we could garnish with syrup without them being too sweet and I recommend adding a couple teaspoons of cinnamon as well. I love the softness the yogurt added and will make these again, probably very soon.

These are so good! What a great way to use up leftover pumpkin from the holidays. I reduced the sugar to 2 T., but only because the pure maple syrup covers up any blanness. If you're worried about it being sweet enough or not, go ahead and use what it calls for.

Liked these a lot!  I used maple spice instant oatmeal for the, brown sugar instead of white, did not add the yogurt, and put in a bit of ground ginger, cinnamon, and all spice.  So good with butter and some fresh maple syrup!

I found these pancakes to be too moist - almost slimy.  The flavor was terrific (I followed a previous reviewer's advice and used some pumpkin pie spice), but I think I'm going to try making them without the yogurt next time and see how they turn out.  Still, a good recipe I'll be continuing to modify until I get it right!

Yuk. Followed exactly, and love pumkin and/or pecan anything, but these were not enjoyable in the least. Needs spices, takes too long to cook for a pancake, not a good texture for a pancake, flat and limp. Deleting this recipe now.

The taste was great. They were a bit flat for me since I really like fluffy pancakes. Once I get this fixed it will be perfect.

I served these for dinner on Shrove Tuesday. I used buckwheat,  so they were very hearty. I liked the crunchy texture of the pecans but some of my friends did not. I'll making these pancakes again, so I may crush the pecans more.
