This soup is amazing and real easy to make. I tweaked it a bit as everyone who loves to cook will do. I added two tablespoons of honey and some cinnamon. I didn’t do the leek but went bigger on the onion. I also added two cloves of garlic. To finish the soup I used cracked smoked bourbon barrel pepper some sunflower seeds and a lit bit of ghost pepper salt which sends this dish over the top for me. Love it

Perfect. Will Make Again for Company.

Great Pumpkin Flavor (Used our Jack-O-Lantern) with a wonderful complementary touch of spice.

Both fresh and Savory! Yum, Thank You Judy.

For Fresh Pumpkin:

After Halloween, Cut J-O-L in half and remove seeds and pulp. Salt and Pepper lightly. Line large cookie sheet (with sides) with parchment or foil (easy clean up) and bake cut side down at 400 for 45 minutes. Let cool and peel. Mash with potato masher.  You get a bunch of pumpkin and can freeze the extra for the next recipe.

Good flexible recipe!  This time I used two onions instead of the onion leek combo.  Worked fine.  Also nice to replace the half and half with coconut milk.

I have a milk allergy so I substituted coconut oil for butter and coconut milk for the cream.  Gave it a devine coconut aroma and was delicious! I used an immersion mixer, but that sprayed hot pumpkin all over my pink shirt, ha ha!  Got the job done though leaving a bit of texture. Saved a bit of the coconut milk to decorate the top of the soup.  Looked fabulous in a white bowl.  Plan to make it for any holiday potlucks this year.  Simple and amazing!

Wonderful. and tasty.  My husband loved it. Substituted  soft steamed cauliflower for leeks and unsweetened coconut milk for half and half. Did not purée as we prefer soup with texture.  Used an electric mixer to blend. Made a double recipe and froze left overs.  Thawed and served to our grown daughter at a later date.  She loved it as well.

Omg yum!! I've made this several times, but today I tweaked it only by adding two more ingredients. I sautéed two jalapeños with the onion and leeks, then added a can of whole cranberries before blending it. Unbelievable how good it is.

This was a hit at a gathering of friends!  I substituted low fat evaporated milk for the half and half, omitted the onion and added about a tsp. of onion salt, used 2 15 oz cans of pumpkin and about a cup of fresh pumpkin I'd frozen and also added 1/4 cup of cooking sherry.   Will definitely add this to my soup collection!

I loved this soup. I added a splash of white wine and instead of half and half, I used low fat milk and served with a dollop of  low fat sour cream and pumpkin seeds on the top. I also added a bit more curry and ground ginger. I will make this again!!

We actually skipped the half and half (by mistake) at the end, but the outcome was incredible! This is our new favorite soup - and now it's a little less fattening!

We really enjoyed this soup.  As there are only two of us, I made a half recipe with the 15 oz. can of pumpkin we had on hand.  Also I didn't bother with the puree process, as we don't care if it's not smooth as silk.  We just eat it!  Was fine!  Will definitely make again..... Like to buy canned pumpkin when it's on sale in the fall.  This is a great alternate use for it.

Decreased the curry to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp all spice.  Husband and adult son loved it.  Used fresh roasted pumpkin blended with little water rather than canned.

I don't know why mine didn't turn out wonderful like so many. I followed it exactly and there is literally no pumpkin flavor. I taste the onions and spices but that's it. I won't make it again.

Amazing flavor!  I followed the ingredients exactly, but like other reviewers I used an immersion blender in the pot for a one-pot dish and easy cleanup.  This is a keeper... thank you!

Amazing, best soup I have had in a long time. I did do half, half and half and half coconut milk, instead of all half and half. I added a cinnamon stick and some chipotle chili pepper. I found it easier to use an emersion blender so that way I can keep it on the stove. Amazing delicious recipe will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe dozens of times. It is outstanding. I don't puree the soup because we like it with the texture. I have not used the leaks. I use about 1/2 of an onion chopped. Sautee in about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I use no margarine or butter. I have used my own pumpkin Mash made from jack-o'-lanterns. And also canned pumpkin. Both taste great. Everyone who has tried this soup has loved it. I highly recommend it.

Loved this soup!  I love curry, so I doubled the amount and a little extra ginger.  I also put in a little extra butter and pulsed the onion and leek (and garlic) before I sweated them in the butter. That made it a whole lot easier.  I also like thick soup so I only put in 2 14 1/2 oz. cans of broth.

Was easy,.  Used a little less broth. Also used vegetable broth. 
Recomend eating with garlic crouton or crispy garlic bread.

I substituted two large shallots for the leek. My husband said it was the best soup he had ever tasted, better than any fancy restaurant.

This was delish. When I've had pumpkin soup before, it was usually too rich for me to finish the bowl. This was wonderfully balanced. The curry made it memorable! I made a couple changes for convenience sake - substituted shredded carrot for leeks, left out the bay leaf, and didn't puree it because I like chunks in my soup. I scarfed it down and can't wait for the next bowl!

The texture was wholly unappealing. I used an immersion blender and substituted evaporated milk for the half and half.

I loved it! The curry and ginger make a good flavor. It was easy and delicious.
