These cookies are a crowd pleaser, and easily modified!  To keep cookies from cooking flat, make sure to cream the butter with the sugar (don't melt your butter!) And if you have time, refrigerate the dough before baking, and between batches

Great cookies!  The first time I made them, they tasted great but came out pretty flat.  The second time, I didn't have any butter so I used butter-flavored Crisco (same amount).  The cookies still tasted great, but kept their shape much better and were big and thick.  Food for thought.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is more of a cake-like cookie than a crispy, crunchy cookie for those who have a preference. At 350, the cookies begin to brown really fast, so I lowered the temp. to 325. The dough is soft and  350 is too high of a temp. to bake at. I would suggest baking at 300-325 degrees. I don't understand why some say they have no flavor? Make sure you use salted butter. You can add a little extra salt if you would like. These are extremely flavorful and my favorite cake-like chocolate chip cookie recipe. I pressed a few M&M's into the tops of half of the cookies.

I can NOT figure out how these got ANY bad reviews.  I just made mine and they have cooled and I cut one is half because it's to close to dinner....I ate the ENTIRE cookie.  **head hung in shame** These are FABU and I followed the recipe to the letter.  BUT....ROOM TEMP butter and eggs ladies and this is where a Kitchen-Aid mixer comes in really handy. I take my butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla and WHIP them until thick and creamy.  I measured out my flour into a sieve along with my baking soda and a PINCH OF SALT (how that got omitted is a mystery to me) and sifted it together then stired in my chocolate chips and walnuts.....then dumped into my whipped butter mix and blend until MIXED ONLY!  It's very important to NOT overbeat any cookie flour mixture. These came out crispy/buttery around the edges and soft in the middle.  I used a BIG cookie scoop and got 8 cookies and I did NOT flatten them by the way. I hope this helps someone. These are a nice break from the Toll House recipe I normally use and I WILL make them again.

I added 1/2 tsp of salt. These cookies are great for milk-dipping! They're airy enough to soak up a lot of milk quickly, but strong enough to not fall apart in the glass. The walnuts are a nice touch. All in all, a great recipe, but not the be-all-end-all of chocolate chip cookies.

This recipe is short 1/2 cup flour. it should call for exactly 1-1/2 cups of flour. otherwise way to FLAT. Also, add another 1/4 cup of white sugar, add 1/2 t salt, omit the nuts and finally use Crisco instead of the butter. Make these changes, and you'll have a 5 star recipe

I replaced the butter with canola oil and scaled the recipe down to make one GIANT cookie for myself. Heh. Dinner of champions. It worked out wonderfully! Great texture and taste, though next time I'd probably add a touch of salt.

These were VERY good.  I added about 1/4 cup more flour than it called for so the dough wasn't so sticky.  Next time I will double the recipe.  This only made 18 normal-sized cookies.  These will probably be gone before tomorrow morning!

This is the best cookie recipe ever. I have tried so many other receipes none are as good as this one. The others turned out hard not chewy. My son who is 17.5 months loves these cookies and so does his father. I make allot because everyone eats them fast.

These were the opposite of giant! I made a batch of 4 cookies so I wouldn't eat too many, and they were way too small to be called Giant Chocolate Chip Cookies. I also cut down on the chocolate chips and left out the walnuts and they held up reall well in the oven. They were more crispy than chewy, but were perfect for dunking and cooled in barely 5 minutes. They weren't what I was looking for, but they were still really yummy!

Added tiny bit (1/4t)salt, and doubled the vanilla, loved how they stayed soft for days afterwards. Didnt add the walnuts and they made 11 cookies. Used white/milk choc and semi sweet choc chips. Will make again, increasing salt to at least 1/2 t. Used salted butter. Roommates asked for them again asap.

Loved this recipe! Followed the directions and it came out perfect. Loved the taste and it stayed soft and chewy.  Too bad it only lasted for not even two days...I had to make more because my boyfriend kept bugging me to make some more. Definitely in my top 5!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The cookies came out very flat and didn't stay together... even after cooled.  I also thought they tasted more like sugar cookies with chocolate chips in them.  Will Not use this recipe again!

This has become my standard recipe. These cookies come out fantastic - just like they're from a bakery! I mixed mini chips and regular sized chips just to give it a fun texture. They turned out great!

These cookies were pretty good, but I have found that if you use Crisco instead of butter they turn out better.  I also use all brown sugar, instead of part brown/part white sugar.  I also added salt and a little more vanilla.

Very good cookies. I found that i didn't need to use an ice cream scooper. That was messy. Its just easier to do heaving scoops with a spoon.

LOVE this simple easy-to-make recipe.  Made 12 large cookies.  I used dark chocolate chips, made the cookie rich tasting.  Yummy.

Although I altered the recipe a bit according to the reviews, this was an excellent cookie recipe.  I added the salt (1/2 t.) and I added a little extra sugar.  Great size for school treats, and in my case, for a whole football team.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thanks for posting it!

Had to add 1/2 tsp of salt. A followed the directions perfectly except for that exception. Tasted floury. The best part of it was the chocolate chips. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone except for people that like cakey cookie. P.S tastes like it needed extra sugar.

These were really good!  Crispy on the edge, chewy in the middle.  I too changed it up a little.  I used Butter Flavored Crisco instead of butter, I also added 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 baking powder, and eliminated the nuts but added more chips!  Very good!  The true test will be when my son comes home from school and gives the thumbs up.

Maybe my ice cream scoop was bigger, but I didn't get the full batch out of this, and had to do it again. (NOT that we minded!!)  Yummy recipe, but needs some salt in the dough, about equal to the amount of baking soda.

One of my all time favorite chocolate chip cookie recipes -- a great variation is to make with the Nestle peanut butter/semi-sweet chip mix.  Awesome!

Amazing recipe! My family loves these and they are my favorite chocolate chip cookie now and they are so easy to make. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1/2 tsp. It gave the cookies a little extra flavor. Overall, they’re lovely! Thanks

These are amazing. I made them into ice cream sandwiches. I baked the cookies extra big and in a large cupcake pan, I filled it with vanilla ice cream, then I put it in the freezer until the cookies were cooked and cooled. Then I transferred the ice cream on to one of the cookies and I put another cookie on top. Then I put them in there own zip block bag, and returned them to the freezer. I set them out 5 minutes before serving. Then I put them on plates and put some whipped cream on top. And they were a big hit. Tip....      you definitely have to cook the cookies for like 20 minutes. But all five stars these were amazingly good

These were really good cookies, I loved them, but they could go for a little longer than the recipe says, I put them in for about 16 mins instead of about 14 mins, but otherwise really good cookies! I would definitely make these again!

I added salt per one reviewer, but should have listened to Koreagirl about the extra flour. Looking for big cookies for a bake sale, I tried these and the "Giant Crisp Chocolate Chip Cookies" by Patricia B, to which I had added extra flour.
Unfortunately I decided to use THIS recipe to finish up my chocolate chips,. They are flat as pancakes and spread out over the pan.  (The "crisp" cookies came out as these were pictured). 
Update: They stuck to all of my pans...…..
I'm not sure how I will salvage the rest of the batch, because it's already mixed. :o(
Last update: lowered the temp to 325, and increased the time to 20 minutes...still too brown. I'm sure someone will like them, but this recipe is a bust. Sorry!

We were looking for a giant cookie recipe... think Noodle & Co or Potbelly. So we tried this. Read a lot of reviews that recommended salt so added a 1/2 tsp. Other than that followed the recipe precisely. Very good cookie. Crispy on the edges, soft in the middle. Just like we like. Since we wanted “giant” cookies we used a large ice cream scoop and it made 4 cookies. Nice and big. Will make again. May have to double the recipe next time but really enjoy having a large cookie as an alternative to the norm.

Absolutely delicious! And I love the small batch. Sometimes I just need a few and the batches are always so big. But this is the other way, small batch and large cookies. The taste is amazing as well. Thank you!!

Used light brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp salt and added 1/4 cup more flour. Used white chips. Cooked at 300 for about 17 minutes on parchment paper. Turned out great.                        Doing same thing with dark brown sugar with chocolate chips.

Followed this recipe on Thanksgiving/2017! I loved the way my batch turned out. I don't know why some say its brownie like, mine were crispy just like I love them!... That's why you have to go ahead and just do the recipes and come up with your own results. My batch was in the oven when I read a review saying they were brownie/cake like and I was instanly ticked off because I don't like soft cookies. Wrong!!! again, mine were crispy and perfect. I will bake again, today actually!

Came out great! No substitutions, made them as directed. Just don't push down too much when they say to flatten the slightly. I see other people's comments that they came out too flat and I feel that they might've pressed them down too much.

I made these for the first time today. I read all the reviews and considered a couple changes. I doubled the recipe, using half butter and half butter flavored crisco. I doubled the vanilla, added a little salt and refrigerated the dough for 15 minutes and in between each pan. I used the smaller scoop and got 33-3 inch cookies. Chewy, soft and firm all at the same time. Very easy. They came out perfect! I'll definitely use this recipe again and again.

These are amazing! I added the salt and also added a tsp of cocoa powder. They are thick and firm but moist in the middle. Took 14 minutes for the 12 large cookies to bake on 2 trays.
I also creamed the butter and sugar. I didn't have brown sugar so just used more white.

I am DEFINITELY going to make these again! They were AMAZING and my family loved them. Although, next time I'm probably going to add some more white sugar. Other than That these were great!

I didn't modify this recipe at all, and these cookies came out great. However they are, in fact, giant! So if you want smaller cookies, keep that in mind. Always a hit around here.

Four out of five because they were delicious cookies but they cooked out very flat, I prefer a thicker cookie.Did not need to press down at all. But these were very good, chewy and not crunchy. Perfect cookie. Thanks for submitting!

I suffered lots of anxiety about this project but in the end I trusted my coookie-baking instincts. I was concerned about the center not baking so I used belt and suspenders----my 14" PC baking stone with parchment paper.  I wanted to present it in a 14" pizza box so I froze some of the dough for later.   I tried rolling it with a second piece of parchment but that didn't work for me at all.  I just used my fingers to a 12" diameter.   My oven was a little hot and the cookie was totally baked....maybe even a tad overbaked, but I didn't want it burned so that's why I used the stone.   Next time I'll do a better job of monitoring the oven temps.   My nephew loved the surprise and he likes the cookie.  I used a 3 to 1 ratio of choc chips to white choc chips and I didn't have a full cup of walnuts so I threw in some pecans.....it's all good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and for all the helpful reviews

These were so fluffy! I was looking for a recipe that wouldn't result in flat crunchy cookies. By far the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! I have to go take the second batch out of the oven. So glad I bought milk today! Yumm!!!

This was really good! they are airy and soft (even after I burnt the first batch they didn't turn crispy). I added just a touch of more sugar, flour and salt (having read the reviews). I also refrigerated the dough to ensure they wouldn't flatten out, it seemed to work.

To be fair, the review is of an amended version of the cookies, per many other reviewers recommendations.  I wanted a thicker cookie, so I substitute shortening for butter.  For us, without butter, the cookies had a funky undertone that we did not like.  The cookies were also not thick, so, the flatter butter versions probably wouldn't be our cup of tea either.

A very good recipe that lends itself to endless possabilities.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/4 cup oat flour, and 1/4 cup almond flour.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and chopped up a granola bar and added it too.  I used a mix of milk chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, white chocolate chips and mini chips. I made a few giant cookies and some smaller (but still large cookies) - the giant ones were slightly crumbly, either due to not being cooked long enough or maybe some of my modifications - the smaller ones were perfect.

These cookies are wonderful! I made them with milk chocolate chips, and my dad came home from work and had one, then asked if they were the store bought break and bake kind. He is the 'one to please' when it comes to cookies, and these definitely passed his test. Very good.

Nothing special.  I doubled the recipe, used my ice cream scoop as suggested and only got 17 "hamburger" sized cookies out of it.
Not a total disappointment, after all who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies?
