This was really good! I made some changes to it though.  I cooked the pork and vegis longer in the fry pan and then put in the crock pot for an hour and a half.  I did not puree the vegis as it said, I left them whole.

Our apples ended up mushy.  There wasn't enough flavor despite using more spices than called for.  There was also too much liquid.  Followed the recipe, but my dinner did not look like the picture.  Wouldn't make again.

It was okay, but sorta flavorless.

Darn good! I love coming home to a hot meal that only took me 20 minutes to prepare before leaving for school.  We threw in some dried cranberries after serving it, and it was the perfect touch. Also: I don't believe you can add too much cider to this recipe.

Picky husband found the apples soured the dish too much.
