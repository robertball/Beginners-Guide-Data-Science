Fabulous, but I did make it a little differently.  I marinated the diced chicken pieces in light Italian dressing for the day and cooked them in a little olive oil instead of butter.  The main change, though, was using a 28 oz jar of pasta sauce and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Served the chicken on top of the pasta and it was awesome.  Thanks for the post!

Totally loved this one.  My daughter took it to school and they thought that it came from a restaurant - it was so tasty.  I use a little less butter and only enough salad dressing to coat the bite sized pieced of chicken.

Very easy and delicious.  I added fresh spinach to the boiling water for the last minute the pasta was cooking.  I will make this again.

This was very good and very quick. I did make one slight change: I cut up the chicken before I marinated it in the dressing. This allowed more chicken to be in contact with the marinade for more flavor. I served this with crusty Italian bread for a satisfying dinner.

We loved it! I ended up not completely draining the chicken. I also added a jar of mushrooms and the diced tomatoes to the chicken. After I drained the noodles, I tossed about a tblsp of fresh italian dressing before adding chicken mixture.

Came out very tasty. I substituted Red Hot for the red pepper flakes. The sauce didn't come out thick enough - I recommend using 1 14 oz of the diced tomatoes and 1 14 oz of tomato sauce and heating them up first.

Don't know why I never thought of marinating the chicken in Italian dressing before!  The tomatoes made a good sauce once I let them cook for a bit.  I threw in some green beans as well.  It was eaten quickly and with enthusiasm.

I made this recipe on a whim, but had to change it because I was not about to go out to the store. I had some frozen Foster Farms chicken thighs from Costco, not breasts. Had some canned diced tomatoes. I didn't have Italian dressing, but I did have great extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, basil, oregano, Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic, Emeril's Essence, and sea salt flakes with rosemary. Plus black peppercorns which I toasted in a skillet and then ground with a mortar and pestle. And some garlic.

Defrosted the chicken using the defrost setting on the microwave. I then marinated the chicken in the mixture above (minus the pepper and garlic). Maybe 20 minutes? Sauteed the garlic for a minute, then threw in the chicken, but without cutting it up. Was making the rigatoni on the side (don't ever forget....LOTS of salt for the boiling pasta water!).

Close to when I thought the chicken was done, I took it out and THEN rough-chopped it. Then back in the skillet.

Drained the pasta and tossed it with the freshly ground toasted black pepper. Then tossed it all with the chicken and some parmesan cheese (I'd rather do something like pecorino romano, but for a quickie the parm did the trick).

It came out tender as heck, and SUPER-flavorful. Spouse loved it and was raving. So was I.

Not bad, but I'm not sure how I feel about the (cold) diced tomatoes.  I may try cooking the tomatoes next time.  Otherwise, a good, uncomplicated recipe.

I wanna start off by saying how much my family loved this dish!!!! My 2 year old has now ate the leftovers for lunch and dinner for the last two days since I made this!! I did make a few minor changes. First I only had 4 chicken breast so I used what I had. The next change I made was I diced the chciken up and seasond it with Salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders. I then marinated it for a few hours instead of just 30 mins. I then used 2 14 oz cans of tomatoe sauce with the diced tomatoes. I left the red pepper flakes out because of the kids eating this. I mixed the noodles, chicken, and cheese together to finish it up!!! I will say it really needed the 6 chicken breast because the kids were asking for more chicken and now we really just have noodles left over and no more chicken!!

Great idea to marinate the chicken. I added onion, garlic, and red pepper to the butter before cooking chicken. Then with the diced tomotoes I added basil and parsley. Very good.

This recipe, exactly as written, is incredible!  My husband asks for it at least once a week.  One modification that I have since made is mostly for the sake of convenience: I cut up fresh chicken breasts into cubes, put them into a large freezer bag, and then add about a third of a bottle of robust Italian dressing to the chicken and mix it about.  Frozen flat so they stack, I can just pull out a bag of these marinated chicken pieces at dinner time, thaw, and Step 1 is done.  I have found that cuts about 15 minutes off from prep time before dinner.

i found this recipe really bland.  that could be because the tomatoes i got were not italian herbed they were just plain.  the chicken pieces are awesome, the italian dressing marinade really made it moist and tender! that would probably be where my 3 star rating came from.

This was a wonderful recipe. I changed just a few things. I cooked my chicken in olive oil instead of the butter and then added the chicken, an onion, tomatoes, and tomato sauce. I mixed the noodles with the chicken mixture in the skillet and added parmesean cheese and parsley. I let this simmer 3 minutes until the cheese was melted and served it hot (We like hot sauces better than the luke-warm kind). All in all a great recipe that we will definitely have again! Thank you!

Super quick and very tasty.  I added the can of diced tomatoes to the cooked chicken so the tomatoes were heated.  I also added some garlic, basil, oregano and let the tomato mixture simmer a little bit before pouring the sauce over the noodles.

This was wonderful.  Great flavor and I made some changes from some of the reviews I read.  I added 24 oz. tomato sauce and a can of rotel.  I then mixed it all together and put it in a casserole dish and baked for 30 minutes at 350.  I then sprinkled some  mozzarella cheese on top and baked 10 more minutes. Everybody loved it.  Will make again soon.

I really liked this. It was quick and tasty, perfect for a working wife and mom schedule.
here is how i altered it. I like my stuff seasoned so i added seasoning salt, garlic and onion salt and black pepper before marinating. Also when i added the dice tomatoes to the pasta i added garlic salt which gave the pasta a great taste. Oh and last thing I changed, and only because I didnt have any chicken breast, i used chicken tenderloins :) This is a must try...

OK folks use some common sense--if you are using plain tomatoes--no garlic or herbs than the recipe is probably going to be bland!  I used plain, added some Italian seasoning and garlic and this was good and hearty!  the next night I added homemade chicken broth and we had a soup!
