Fabulous recipe! I used the Italian Herb and Soul Seasoning blends instead of mixing my own, as the cook's note suggests. I also added red onion as suggested by another reviewer. My own twist came with adding chunks of summer squash to the vegetables. My absolute favorite part of the dish was the flavor of the roasted veggies. This is definitely a keeper!

We enjoyed this recipe. I also added red onion to the mixture. I used 3 pounds of pork chops and had plenty of rub. Will make again.

Very good flavor, but a bit runny. I did add cream of chicken soup to thicken a bit. Other additions were zucchini, wine and onion.

AWESOME!  Thank you for another way to get some vegetables into my husband and he LOVED it.  My modifications:  1 lb of boneless chops, 2 zucchini, 1 pkg mushrooms and 1 big tomato.  Chopped up all the veggies put them in a bowl together and tossed them with olive oil, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.  Put them around the outside of the pan.  Seasoned the chops with seasoning salt, Italian seasoning and Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb.  This combo covered most of the seasonings except the red pepper which we didn't want anyway.  Because I had much less meat, I cooked mine at 350 for the first 30 minutes and 425 for the last 15 to keep from overcooking.  It was perfect.  Served it over brown rice with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese over the top.  My veggie averse husband asked me to put it in our regular rotation.  Leftovers today were even better!

Very good. I used thin cut pork chops so I would use thicker ones in the future. I would also like to try different vegetables since my fiance isn't a big tomato or mushroom fan.

Absolutely delicious! I used italian seasoning and then added the rest of the spices to save time. I added fresh greens beans and sliced baby carrots to the mix. It was a total hit. Im making it for the second time as we speak and cant WAIT for dinner!

although this recipe was not bad I felt the "sauce" was very watery and sis not taste much like garlic. Also my pork cjops were very very dry. The veggies did turn out good though.

This was a great pork chop recipe.  But I think 40+ minutes at 425 is way too long.  I cooked it at 400 for 40 minutes and they were overdone.
I added onions and bell peppers to the veggie mix, and they were delicious.  I did the spice rub exactly as written.

The mushrooms and tomatoes were divine!! I would've given it 5-stars if it weren't for the effort of yanking all of those spices out for the rub that ended up tasting just like, well, spicy. All of those complex flavors just didn't come together the way that I would've anticipated. But baked at 350 deg. for 35, 40 min., the chops and veggies were the perfect texture and done-ness for my family, and we will gladly do this recipe again, but maybe w/ a simplified rub, or my simple go-to for pork chops - sea salt, black pepper, paprika, and EVOO. Very good dish that I'm glad to have tried!

Pork chops are not Bill's favorite but he loved these.  I used pork chops that were a inch thick and they were mosit and the taste was out of the ballpark.  Thanks for sharing.

Have made this several times and we love it!  Didn't have quite all the spices on hand that were called for , so omitted a few.  Also my pork chops were thin cut so I turned down the oven to 400 degrees and reduced the cooking time to 35 minutes.

This is an excellent recipe! Followed it exactly the first time and everyone loved it. I've made it several more times and it turns out great. I had to use canned plum tomatoes once instead of fresh tomatoes and the recipe was still delicious. Last time I made it, I added onions, zucchini, carrots, and red bell pepper chunks. I think that heightened the flavors even more.  The best thing is, this dish can sit in the oven warming while not drying out the pork.  The pork is always juicy. Thanks for a keeper!

The rub for this recipe emptied about a third of my spice cabinet, but it was oh so good!  
I only had two roma tomatoes, so I used some tomatillos from my garden.  Those and the diced sweet onion that I added gave it just a little more zip.  Not spiciness, but a mildly tangy flavor.  
I'll make this again and again.  The rub mixture is something I'll also try on other meats, such as chicken.

This is 5 Star quality.  I used all the spices, didn't have a couple, but threw in a couple of 1/4 tsps. Italian Seasoning.  Followed all to the letter, except did use regular tomatoes since did not have Romas, and sliced the mushrooms I did have on hand, white, small portos, and a couple of Shitakes.  
Added red onion, the little I had left from another dish, as others have suggested/
This was delicious.  The sauce that cooks down as the dish cooks, the rub, OMGosh, this tasted like I was eating in a fine-dining restaurant.
Make sure you cover it...I think that's why one poster's burned dry.  Always good to put in directions whether to cover it or not.  I wasn't going to, because it didn't say to, but figured it out after reading comments.
Loved it.  So did Hubs.  YUM

Absolutely delicious! Only thing I would do is cut down the. Ookimg time for the pork chops, or use thicker  cut ones, as they were a bit dry. The sauce, and the flavors of the herb mixture were just fabulous and I will be sure to make it again.
