My family LOVED this dish!!  No, it doesn't have a LOT of flavor, but I think that is what my children liked about it. It was mild enough tasting for everyone in my family to enjoy.

I Find it better to incorporate a1 steak sauce as opposed to the regular soy sauce. It provides the meal with flavor! Not only does it bring out the taste of the steak but also, it brings out the flavor in the broccoli.

I was looking for an easy beef and broccoli stir fry, with not too many extra fancy ingredients. That's why I saved this one. But I have to say it lacked soooo much flavor!!! I added a teaspoon of Knorr vegetable bouillon, more soy sauce and a bit pepper. It came out good but only after seasoning it.
Since my husband doesn't eat broccoli I set some beef aside and used orange and green bell pepper instead. It was just as good, again with my additional seasoning.
Will definitely do it again but not according to the original recipe posted here.

I added Black Bean Garlic Sauce, sugar snap peas & sweet onion in place of the green onion.  Used leftover rice & beef roast.  Saut√©ed the veggies then added the rice & beef....very good & easy!

I made this dish for my dad. The first time, it was bland and dry.  The second time, I added slightly more water and a bit more soy sauce for flavor. I also put in some sugar snap peas and carrots along with the broccoli, garlic, and onion.  My dad loved it and actually had seconds.

It was yummy!!  I added onions and garlic with the beef and used olive oil.  I also threw in some mushrooms with the broccoli.  It was a hit with the family!
