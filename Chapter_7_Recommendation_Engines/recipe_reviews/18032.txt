WOW this was good. I followed posters suggestions and used 2C water and dissolved a boulion cube in it. I also added a little white wine, the garlic and a shallot to deglaze the pan b4 adding the water/spice mixture. Even then, I had to add about a cup more water while it was cooking. I also dredged the chik breasts in a lemon pepper seasoning in addition to the oregono. I omitted all the salt from the recipe too, since boulion is so salty. Made the leftover broth into gravy, cooked up the Uncle Bens Chicken rice, and dinner was AbFab!! I will def be making this again!

Easy and moist.  I did as others suggested and added more liquids: 1/2 c chicken broth, 1/3 lemon juice, and since I had it on hand, about 1/2 c white wine.  When ready to plate, I thickened sauce with cornstarch.  It was great over egg noodles! Took less than 3 hrs. in crockpot.

This chicken is truly delicious.  I have made this recipe four or five times already, it's definitely a keeper.  It doesn't make much extra sauce so if you want some to scoop over potatoes or pasta you should double the sauce.  The only thing I do differently is I use boneless skinless chicken tenders instead of chicken breast halves.  The chicken pieces are smaller which allows them to soak up more of the juices and seasonings making them very flavorful and tender.  I have also added sliced mushrooms... yum.

My first crock pot experience, and it turned out great! I took a lot of advice from the posts here: I covered the bottom of the pot with potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and lots of garlic (about 6 cloves). I used bone-in breasts (I did brown them first, using butter, salt and lemon-pepper mix, awesome), then deglazed the pan with 1 cup white wine. Added all that to the pot, along with 2 cans of chicken stock, 6 tablespoons lemon juice, and a little more salt. I cooked on high for 2 hours, then low for 1 hour - perfect! I think the bone-in chicken made a big difference, it was wonderful and falling apart. I would be careful with the lemon juice - I love strong flavors and was tempted to add more, but my 6 tablespoons was bordering on too bitter - excellent though! Also turned the extra juice into gravy for veggies and it was yummy, with side of chicken couscous!

What a dish!  I doubled the spices except the garlic and used the juice of an entire lemon, and used chicken stock instead of water/boullion, using enough stock to almost cover chicken.  And 30 min. before cook time finished, I stirred in 2 T. cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water.  Plenty of sauce for serving with chicken over pasta.  And here's a trick:  it was REALLY lemony and too sour, so I stirred in almost 2 T sugar.  Totally fixed that problem.  It was DIVINE!!!  Thanks for an awesome, interesting recipe.

An awesome lo-carb dish. You don't have to brown the chicken. Just mix the seasonings in a pot on the stove and boil slightly then poor over the chicken in the slow cooker. Use xanthum to thicken the left over juices into a very flavorful gravy!

THis turned out surprisingly good!!! I used two boneless skinless breasts, (1lb) and I did everything by the recipe except used more garlic as we LOVE garlic...I used the already minced garlic...I also took everyone elses advice & used chicken broth instead of water...I made enough to cover chicken so it did not dry out...I also cooked this for about 4 1/2 hours on low.....I took juice out of crockpot, added cornstarch to thicken it up & made a yummy gravy! returned gravy & chicken to crockpot & left on warm..chicken fell apart & soaked in so much flavor it was unreal! I served w/Uncle Ben's whole grain brown rice w/garlic flavors & steamed broccoli & cauliflower & it was sensational! My fiance is NOT a big chicken eater & he ate every bite of his & complimented the flavor! Will definitely make again...I def. agree that making sure the breasts are covered in liquid is key..also, my chicken breast were kind of thick & so I think this helped it not to dry out! Sooo yummy!

After reading a few reviews, this is what I did - 3 pounds of chicken (family packs on sale here!) seasoned with salt, pepper and oregano. Browned in butter. 1 14 oz can chicken broth, 4 tbsp lemon juice (from the bottle) and 3 cloves minced refrigerated garlic. 1 hour on high. 3 hours on low. 30 minutes before serving, mixed 2 tbsp cornstarch with 1/4 cup water and poured over the top. This was absolutely some of the best chicken I have ever tasted. My whole family loved it. And the sauce was so good I could've just eaten a bowl of it like soup! Seriously good stuff.

Very good, would be 5 stars with a few tweeks. The recipe was a little salty for my taste, I will reduce the salt next time. Also, I cooked for 6 hours on low but chicken turned out a little overcooked. Next time, I think 4-5 hours would be plenty. Will definatley make this again, thanks.

YUMMY!  This was incredible!  I used bottled lemon juice, since I didn't have any lemons on hand, and it was still great.  I also used the boillon and it was fine.  
I did double the amount of sauce, and thicken it with a little cornstarch at the end.  But, oh, my -- this is definitely going into regular rotation!

This came out excellent with modifications! The amount of seasonings in the recipe is not nearly enough. ( I DID LEAVE OUT THE SALT!) I sprinkled onion pwder on the chicken as well before browning. I added more oregano, garlic and pepper - didn't measure, just went by eye & to my liking. I added a 1/2 sweet onion, fresh basil, juiced one whole lemon, added one cup white wine & added about 3 tablespoons fresh parsley. I also used a cup of chicken broth AND a 1/2 teaspoon of chicken boullion for extra flavor. It came out PERFECT and was not salty AT ALL!! Great, GREAT flavor!! Served it over a brown rice mix. =) YUM!

This dish was very, very good. I omitted the water and bouillon and used 1/4 cup of chicken broth instead, and it worked wonderfully. The garlic and lemon truly infuse the chicken, which becomes incredibly tender in the slow cooker. My only caveat would be that the chicken was somewhat bland--it's not a very piquant dish. (I'm love strong flavors, but this isn't a characteristic slow cooking usually imparts.) Nonetheless, I'll definitely make this again.

I always read the reviews before I fix one of the Daily Recipes.  Based on the reviews, I browned the chicken then used half of a small onion and browned it and the garlic.  I used 2 cups of water, 2  generous teaspoons of the chicken bouillon and then followed the recipe the rest of the way it was written.   This was practically inhaled by my family.  I make this every 6 to 8 weeks and get rave reviews every time.  Thanks for sharing, Carla Joy.

I used about a cup of homeade turkey broth instead of the granules, and added about 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice.  It was very good, with my alterations.

This was terrific! The chicken was so moist and just fell apart.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours. I did make 2 cups of chicken broth, the juice from one lemon, 4 cloves of garlic and some white wine. I forgot to boil that mixture before putting it in the crock pot, but I can't tell what I was missing. The key is browning the chicken before putting it into the pot. I would suggest using olive oil instead of butter and putting the garlic in for the last 2 minutes to get the full flavor. I also shred the chicken and let it soak up the juices for awhile before serving - yummy! We used the juice to pour over the chicken. This was a great meal to come home to with hardly any effort! It will be in my monthly dishes from now on.

This chicken comes out so tender that you can't even cut it without it falling apart! I seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper seasoning before the oregano mixture, and used garlic salt instead of regular. Then instead of bouillon granules, I used about 1 to 1  1/2 cups of chicken stock. The flavor was incredible and I've never had chicken turn out so tender!

I took a lot of the advice from other reviews.  Namely, use at least 2x the seasoning but cut the salt, use a couple tablespoons lemon pepper, add wine, and use a can of broth.  Cooked it for 3 hrs on high and it came out moist.

One addition if you like them is to add capers when you simmer the broth with cornstarch to make a sauce.  Added just enough pizzaz to this recipe to make it keeper.

Did a few things others suggested.  Did not brown, just put all the makings (except the chicken) into a pot and brought it to a boil then poured it over the raw chicken in the slow cooker.  Also replaced water with 1 cup chicken broth and added 1/4 cup white wine - doubled lemon juice, garlic, and chicken bouillon granules.  Cut cooking time to 4 hours on low.  Had plenty of liquid, the chicken was very tasty and moist.  Will definitely make again!!

This is the hardest review I've written.  3 stars for taste.  I thought it was a little too mild (I love flavor!).  And 6 hours was definitely too long!  In order to make it 5 starts, you would basically need to double the sauce but add more garlic/lemon and possibly some seasoning to the chicken.  (And I used lemon pepper seasoning as well!).  However, the recipe deserves 5 stars solely becuase it is not a "cream of" recipe, it uses the wonderfully easy crock pot, and I feel healthy eating it.  This recipe has fantastic potential.

This was delicious.  I doubled the sauce even though I only cooked 2 chicken breasts and made linguini as a side.  I used the sauce from the crock pot to mix in with my linguini.  This will be a regular at my house for my husband and I.

I put this recipe in my box 3 years ago...I finally cooked it over the weekend and it was phenomenal!  Like other reviewers, I doubled (should have tripled) the liquid ingredients.  My slow cooker is pretty strong, so I cooked mine on Low for 4 hours, rotating the chicken halfway through the cycle so that the chicken on top would get in the juices.  After 2 hours, the chicken was falling apart it was so tender!  I removed the chicken from the juices, added a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch and made a fabulous gravy.  Served it over egg noodles with steamed broccoli.  It was a crowd pleaser!  And the little leftovers there were, the chicken was still tender when re-heated!

We gave this five stars, although I took a lot of suggestions along the way!  First, didn't bother browning the chicken.  Second, omitted the salt and bouillon/water and used a can of chicken broth and a glug or two of white wine.  Third, used lemon pepper instead of regular and used a whole teaspoon.  Put it all into the crock pot and cooked two hours on high and two and a half on low.  It came out pretty well, although next time I might try putting in some of the lemon zest to give it a little bit more lemon flavor.  Thanks!

A real keeper. I tripled the liquids to cover the chicken, which made lots of wonderful gravy later.  I also added the wine to the liquid and I added mushrooms, onions and red potatoes on the bottom.

Delicious!!!! I shedded the chicken afterwards and put it with rice and peas. I also made the sauce into a gravy, then mixed it all together.  Like others have posted, you need more water and cubes. I made 2 cups of broth and used 1/4 C lemon juice.  With my modifications it turned out fab, whole family LOVED it and I will definatly make again!

Second time around I put a bit of lemon pepper seasoning and fried the chiken thighs (not breast) and It was fabulous. I only cooked it in the slow cooker for a few hrs, served it with rice and peas agian for a complete meal. Yummy what a great recipie thanks.

Delicious!  I have been putting off making this for about a week now because I was nervous that it wouldn't go over well.  Soooo, I ended up adding 1 1/2 cups of Swanson chicken broth vs. the bouillon & water (I do however think that it cooked much faster due to all of the liquid).  I also used 3 boneless skinless breasts & 2 bone in legs\thigh pieces (hubby likes chicken on the bone).  WOW - they all loved it!  Don't forget to make a gravy with the left over drippings.  This is wonderful, Thank you Carla!!!!!!!!!

This is healthy, easy and fast, inexpensive and delicious... a 5 star rating for sure! I make this alot, the only change that I make is that I just throw everything in the crock pot without browning or boiling and let the crock pot do it's work. I usually shred it a bit and serve over whole-grain thin pasta noodles or egg noodles and it's fantastic! This is comfort food, not spicy or over the top...so if you are looking for a "wow" your guests recipe, this is not the one. It's just great family food. Perfect for a cold day like today!

The flavor is amazing!  I didn't brown the chicken ahead of time and I suggest not cooking the chicken frozen, it drys out every time.

When I dont have time to throw it in the slow cooker, I ended up just dicing the chicken and adding the garlic, lemon juice and broth into a fry pan and cooked it that way. It's done in 15 minutes or less and you get the same flavor with fairly moist chicken.

I know that a lot of people don't really like it when people change a bunch of stuff in the recipe then review it. Well, sorry, cause that's exactly what I did and it was really good. I basically took the advice of others by adding wine (1/2 cup), doubling the sauce (used 1 can chik broth), etc. I always have a batch of my homemade seasoned flour on hand, so I used that and added extra Oregano. I added some sauteed onions and extra garlic in with the chicken. the last 30 minutes I added a can of Artichoke hearts ( the kind in water, but drained) and some Capers. I adjusted the salt in the recipe accordingly, by the way. I thickened the sauce a bit with some cornstarch and I swirled in about a tbsp of butter right before serving. I served it over Linguine and a bed of fresh spinach. The sauce and chicken wilted the spinach a bit, but it was still a bit crunchy. We sprinkled Feta and Parm chz on top. Everyone liked this, even picky kids. Going into the rotaion for sure!  Oh -it was done on high in about 2 hours, 45 minutes. turned it on warm till we were ready- The chicken was done prefectly!

If you love lemon and you love chicken, you will LOVE this recipe. I thought this seemed like too much oregano to use, but it works just perfectly with the lemon flavor. Finally, a good lemon chicken recipe that isn't bland. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out awesome. Wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Very simple meal to prepare and yet the flavor was wonderful.  We're so sick of the typical slow cooker "add cream of _____ soup" recipes and this was a nice change.  I used chicken stock and fresh lemon juice, per other reviews.  Will keep this recipe on hand and pass it along to other working couples!

Made this for dinner last night, and it was really VERY good. I omitted the oregano (we hate oregano), reamed a large lemon for 4 tbs of juice and pulp instead of juice only, used Better Than Bullion bullion paste, added 3 oz of chopped shallots and an extra clove of garlic when deglazing the pan, and used Smart Balance instead of butter to help cut down on the fat. I also added 1/2 c water to the slow cooker and let it cook on high for about 5 hours. My house smelled amazing all day, and dinner did not disappoint! I served it with steamed broccoli and lemon butter rice, which was especially good with the sauce from the chicken. We wished there was more. I think I will follow others' suggestion of white wine when deglazing to help bolster the amount. The chicken was slightly dry, so next time I will cut the cook time down to four hours. And there *will* be a next time. I've already been asked by my husband to add it to the dinner rotation! Thanks to Carla Joe for sharing this recipe and to all the reviewers who shared their suggestions. Great communal effort with a wonderful outcome. :-)

I made this for the first time tonight, and my family has asked me to add it to our regular rotation.  I did make a few changes: First, I used bone-in breasts with the skin removed.  I left out the water & bouillon and used a can of chicken broth instead.  The chicken turned out with all kinds of fall-apart goodness, with flavor deep into the meat.  Afterward, I thickened the juice with cornstarch and we used it as gravy on both the chicken and the rice I made on the side.  Definitely a keeper for us.

This recipe is delicious. The chicken falls of the bone and is full of flavor. I added extra lemon and lots of extra garlic. I also have cooked it with about 1/4 c of white wine and the sauce was delicious.

Wonderful. Too bad I can't give this more stars!!! This is one of my family's favorite dishes. After making this many times exactly as written, I have come up with some changes that work well for my family (the original recipe is still wonderful as is). I use broth instead of bouillon to reduce salt and avoid MSG that is in bouillon. I increase the water and lemon juice a bit. I always make way more of this than we will eat because the leftovers make the world's best chicken salad.

Delicious! I followed the recipe, didnt use chicken boulion and used lemon juice in concentrate, I cooked it for 6 hours on low and it was basically falling apart. Very moist and flavorful, reminded me of those rotissary chickens you can buy at the supermarket except this was even jucier I think!

What a GREAT and EASY dinner!! Just like others said, I added more liquid to the sauce and then made it into a gravy to go over the rice. My crockpot cooked this meal in 2 hours on low! The chicken was absolutely delicious, very tender, and really took on the flavors of lemon, garlic, and oregano. This will most definitely become one of the 'regulars' at our house!

This was sooooo EASY.  I let the chicken marinate in the juices overnight and this was absolutely the most tender and moist chicken I have ever had.  And if you like greek (lemon and garlic) this is the recipe for YOU!:)

Made this last night. It was a hit with my husband and myself.  Took the advice of adding some additional liquid in the crockpot and only cooked it long as directed.  Very moist and tender..good taste.  Didn't use the lemon juice. Used the remaining liquid for gravy.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good! I used 3 lbs. of chicken which was pretty much 3 large breasts. As per other recommendations, I used 1/3 cup of lemon juice and two cups of water. I cooked for 4 hrs. on low and the chicken was excellent - not dry at all but the chicken did fall apart. I used the juices to make a sauce/gravy. I boiled it gently on the stove in a small sauce pan and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. 

I arranged pieces of chicken on top of a mountain of angel hair pasta and served it with broccoli on the side.

We were very disappointed. The chicken smelled so good as it cooked in the crockpot for the 6 hrs. on low. Then, with mouths watering, we suffered the realization that the chicken was completely tasteless. I even included 4 cloves of garlic, one shallot, and 2 c. chicken broth. I don't know if I did something wrong but I will not try this recipe again. Thanks anyway.

Absolutely wonderful! Recipe is four stars, as is but the way I did it would get it five. I made it with two chicken breasts. I added 1/4 cup white wine (as others suggested) and used 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of the bullion cube. Otherwise, I kept everything the same. Turned out delicious!

I found this recipe and it seemed simple enough. Many (MANY )of the readers recommended I tweak the recipe, which I did. I added a 2 tsp of olive oil to the butter, bc as one reader said it wouldn't have been enough to brown. I also used a lemon pepper seasoned salt from Goya instead to season the chicken before I browned it. I also let the pan get a little brown(yummy brown, not eww, its burned brown) on the bottom and deglazed it with chicken broth and added it to the crock pot. (I find that gives it the best flavor!) I don't like using bouillon cubes, so I added 2 cups of chicken broth, like many of the readers recommended. I added Italian seasonings (rosemary, thyme, oregano, parsley flakes) on top of the chicken. I love garlic and onions, so I used half a small onion (chopped) and used 6 garlic cloves (minced). Then I squeezed a whole lemon into the crock pot and added the squeezed lemon pieces in. I like doing this because it gives in a real lemon-y flavor. I also added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar which a few readers recommended as well. It took about 30 mins prep time. I am cooking the chicken on high for 6 hours. I love things fully cooked, so I would rather have it fall apart than be underdone. I will probably add some potatoes and serve over rice. :)

OMG.. This was soooooooo good! I followed the suggestions and doubled the sauce ingredients and also added 1/2 cup of white cooking wine to the sauce before cooking and I'm glad I did, it made a WONDERFUL gravy to go over the chicken. The gravy would of been great over mashed potatoes but I made rice and it was still good. Other than that I followed recipe as written and everyone raved about the meal. Even the picky eaters went back for 3rds. THANKS!!!!!

Great quick and easy chicken dish. I love lemon so I sqeezed 2 lemons in the pot, used low sodium broth & like others omitted the salt. I browned both sides in a pan, diced onions, then added seasonings & all else to the croc pot. Cooked for an hour & a half on high in my new pot. So I advise to watch it so it doesn't get too dry as cook time will vary depending on your pot and how much chicken you add.

My family loved this recipe! I did double the liquids but that was just because I wanted some extra for the rice. And I used garlic pepper on the chicken when browning but we love garlic! All in all, great recipe and very easy to make :)

The chicken is fairly pedestrian but I loved the lemony sauce that comes with it.  After pouring the remains of the cooker into a saucepan, I whisked in a little corn starch and finished it off with a couple of generous splashes of white wine.  Served with roast potatoes and green salad.  Next time I'll see what else I can do with chicken.

This turned out so good!  Made with a side of chicken and broccoli rice.  I made sure the chicken was covered in liquid the entire time (left it to marinade in crock pot without turning it on for about an hour).  Cooked on high for one hour then turned down to low for 3.  Was super moist and tasted great!

i started this early in the morning, used frozen chicken breasts, made a marinade of about 2 tablespoons lemon pepper, 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup of water, chopped four garlic cloves and put it on the crock pot about 11:00. by 6:00 that evening, the house smelled wonderful and the chicken was falling apart! i know i didnt follow the recipe exactly, but it was so incredibly easy and delicious. my fiance said "we have to have this again!" served with white rice and green beans, the sauce in the crockpot was delicious. definitely a keeper!

We love this recipe! I've been making it for several years, now everyone in my family makes it too! Definately add more water, the sause is great when served over brown rice. Also I found that coating the chicken -there isn't enough spice mixture, I sprinkle it into the pan, lay the chicken down and then sprinkle another layer on the top, works much better and is faster!

Awesome, easy and DELICIOUS! A definite "keeper." My only suggestion is for people who have a large slow cooker (mine is a 6-qt.) you may want to make 2-3 times as much of the lemon juice mixture as the amount suggested in the recipe, as that much barely even wet the bottom of my cooker. As a result the chicken was a little drier than I expected. But the flavor was still wonderful! Went great over rice with brocolli on the side. BTW for those of you watching your fat intake, you can add the lemon juice mixture directly to the slow cooker, without mixing in the pan drippings, and it tastes exactly the same. (Discovered this by accident when I forgot that step!)

Perfect recipe for the summer, light and you don't have to heat up your house with the oven! I served it over rice and it was WONDERFUL! After cooking all day, the chicken is SO tender. I used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh and it still turned out very tasty.

As is, this recipe is all right.  My husband said it'd be good to make again but with less salt.  I'd also make the following adjustments: Cut the salt. Reduce the amount of lemon juice to 2 TBS, add more chicken stock (2 cups)  and and as others suggested 1/2 cup white wine.  If you want to thicken the juices into a sauce you'll need more liquids. I cooked this on low for 6 hours and it came out a little dry.  I'd cut back the cooking time as well.

Excellent! I wished I had cooked more...It was juicy and falling apart...I added lemon pepper seasoning to the chicken along with extra garlic to the sauce and thickened it with cornstarch...I will definitely be making this again.

i tried this recipe for the first time last week and i noticed alot of people were complaining about the blandness of the chicken, to fix that i cut it up into cubes, i also used broth instead of bullion, and i seasoned to my own liking because this recipe has next to no spices (which could have a lot to do with the blandness) i think i might have quadrupled everything except the chicken and i only doubled the lemon juice. it turned out amazing, my hubby is the pickiest man i have ever met and he is actually asking me to make it again :D

Very good. The chicken was very tender and moist. I'm not giving it 5 stars only because the bouillon made it very salty, should probably use chicken broth instead. Also the lemon is a bit overpowering. I think 2 tbsp of lemon juice should be enough.

I followed the other reviewer's advice and added mushrooms, onion and garlic to the bottom of the slow cooker.   I seasoned the chicken as described, and then dredged the chicken in flour. I cooked the chicken as described, and deglazed the pan with white wine, lemon and garlic.  One thing I did do differently:  I took a generous amount of fresh rosemary and added it to the slow cooker, as well as some ground sage. It's cooking right now and smells wonderful. Thank you very much :D

The first time I made this recipe I followed the it as directed and it came out very dry and bland. Since then I have made it several times with these changes: I omit the water, lemon juice, and chicken bouillon and use 1 cup chicken broth with a few tablespoons of a lemon pepper marinade, add the garlic and parsley with a little onion and cook on low for 4 hours so the chicken doesn't come out dry, and serve it over rice.

This is a fabulous recipe.  We had it the other night for dinner.  As other readers have suggested, I used one can of chicken broth and chicken thighs.  At the end, I thickened the sauce with a little flour and served it over Dreamfields penne rigate since my husband is a diabetic.  After I rubbed the seasoning mixture into the chicken, I let it set for about 1/2 hour in the refrig.  We will have this recipe often!!!

This was pretty tasty, and nice for busy weekday lunches to go.  I wish I had white wine at hand because it would have given this the zing it needed.  I doubled (if not tripled) the sauce, added a little cornstarch.  Also added frozen green beans and served atop spaghettini.  Would be great topped with parmesan or mozzarella.

This is one of my favorite slow cook recipes!  I usually rub the chicken breasts with Italian Seasonings and Chilli Powder along with the salt and pepper.  I love the fact that this is one of the few slow cook recipes that doesn't have a lot of sauce - although if you want, you can make a great gravy with the liquid.  Excellent recipe!

This was AMAZING.  I have heard that if you brown chicken before you put it the crock pot than the outside layer wont let luice run in, so... I skipped out on the browning step.  I added a chopped onion and some baby carrots.  Its very important that you dont over cook the chicken, but... if you do, just shred it up and serve it over rice. (Thats what happened to me the first time I made this...)  I cook mine for 4.5-5 hours.  Perfect.

I halved the recipe, but used the orginal amount of liquid.  Next time I'll halve the lemon juice, too.  I forgot the parsley, but it was great anyway.  I love slow cooker recipes, and so far this is my favorite.  My husband raved about it, and he's a tough judge.

I cooked this a little longer than it was suppose to be, and it was the driest chicken I've ever tasted. I used only two chicken breasts and barely had enough seasoning to rub into them; there was so little liquid in the crockpot it actually burnt in places. However, my husband thought it was OK, just needs more liquid while cooking to make it more juicy. We'll see.

Tried this great recipe yesterday and it was great. I made a few changes to the original recipe after reading most of the reviews. 
1. I used adobo seasoning (Goya, garlic powder, oregano along with some freshly squezzed orange juice and let it sit in the fridge for 2+ hours before cooking. No need to brown the chicken prior to cooking.
2. I used homemade broth from a previous recipe that I saved to use it later ( definetly a time saver, and taste saver too!)
3. After cooking the garlic, lemon juice and the broth I strained the garlic from the skillet. That way the liquid had only the flavor of the garlic instead of overpowdering it. 
4. Once in the slow cooker, I added baby carrots and peas. they were cooked in the amazing broth and came in super tender, also the chicken was in the broth and came out with amazing flavor, juicy and very very tender. 

My family loved this recipe with the modifications I did. Hope this helps others and like I always say do not be afraid to modify a recipe, most times it is just a guide. Enjoy!!

I made this for dinner tonight and we thought the flavor was good, but found the chicken breasts to be quite dry - even though we only cooked for 6 hours in the slow cooker. I didn't bother browning anything, I just threw it all in the slow cooker and let it do the work. I increased the garlic to four big cloves, roughly chopped, added a half cup of white wine and cooked on low. The end result was tasty...but dry.

Yum!  Lots of flavor in this dish.  The only changes I made were 1) I used the juice of two lemons (a little more than 3 T.)  After browning the chicken (I used 5 fat breasts cut in half), I deglazed the skillet with bouillion dissolved in about a cup of hot water, about a half cup of chicken broth, lemon juice, garlic and I also added about a cup of white wine.  These ingredients were boiled together and poured over the chicken in the crock pot.  I cooked the chicken in the crock pot for about 7 hours on low.  I served this with penne pasta sprinkled with parmeson and green beans.  My family loved it.

This was an easy enough meal to put together.  I took the advice of anothe reviewer and used a can of chicken broth, 1/3 cup of lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of white wine.  They provided enough liquid to keep it from getting dry and added some nice flavor.  Didn't use the bouillon granules.  I agree the sauce needs thickening if you'll serve over noodles or rice.

I tripled this for a company pot luck.  I omitted the parsley and substituted broth for the bouillon/water.  This could have used more lemon and more garlic.  It would have been much easer/faster to just finish cooking the chicken in the browning pan than transferring it to the slow cooker.  I probably won't make this again.  It wasn't bad, but not worth the effort.

I have been searching for slow cooker chicken recipes that don't require cream soups or other processed foods, and this one seemed to fit the bill.  It was decent, but nothing spectacular.  I made a few changes which I think made it much better.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine (pinot grigio) then added 1 cup chicken broth.  Since I cooked only 4 chicken breasts (about 1 lb.) this was enough liquid to cover them in the slow cooker.  I kept the other ingredient amounts the same.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours, removed the chicken and added a corn starch slurry (2 Tbsp. corn starch in 2 Tbsp. water) to thicken up the sauce and served it all over angel hair pasta.  It came out a little bland and dry.  I think I will make this again, but maybe season the chicken with "Chicken Seasoning Blend" from this site to perk it up.

This chicken is so good!  I tweaked the recipe to add more seasoning, garlic and broth.  I quadrupled the garlic, added about 1.5-2 cups of broth (enough to cover the chicken in the crock pot) and I juiced a whole lemon.  The chicken turned out very tender and flavorful.    I serve it as a main entree with rice and steamed veggies. I also like to cut it up and put it on my salads or even put it in a sandwich (between wheat bread with fresh spinach and any other fixins you like)... YUM!    Try it!!!! :)

This was fantastic.  I made a few modifications based on what I had and other reviewers recommendations. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (thats what I had on hand) and used 1 cup of chicken broth in place of the bouillon and water.  I also upped the lemon juice to just shy half a cup (I wanted something really lemoney, it was 2 juiced lemons) and doubled the spices rubbed into the chicken.   I will be making this quite often!

Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  I used it as a base.  I used chicken legs, increased the water to one and half cups and used chicken base corresponding to the amount of water.  Lemon pepper for the pepper.  The results were awesome.  I would consider adding capers and green olives next time.  Served it with white and wild rice on the side.  It's a keeper.

This was delicious! I followed a lot of the other reviewers suggestions. I find on this site I tend to use cooking recipes (not baking) as a base recipe. I doulbed all the liquids and added 1 cup of white semi sweet wine. It was amazing! I also used bone in skin on chicken breasts to add flavor and took the skin off when it was done. I tried to fork one to check for doneness and it fell apart in the juices! It was amazing and I will definitely make it again! Thanks for the great post

Very good recipe but be sure not to overcook as it can be dry!If you use bonless chicken only cook on low about 4-5 hours and bone in chicken and hour or 2 more max! I added a bit more lemon/garlic than the recipe called for and fresh pepper and chives and some oregeno and served it over white and wild rice. Yum. Will make again.

The chicken was very dry ( I did not cook the full time, either) and the taste was nothing that would lead me to make it again.  My kids who eat everything, would not eat it.

This chicken was fabulous!  It turned out a lot better than I thought, based on the other reviews.  It had excellent flavor and the chicken was very moist.  I used half the amount of chicken but the full amount of all the other ingredients and substituted Italian seasoning for oregano because that's all I had.  I prefer the sauce in this type of dish to be very liquidy, so I didn't add corn starch like some people did.  We ate it over brown rice and I think the bright, tangy sauce really complimented the slight chewiness of brown rice.  I'm new to cooking with crock pots and I'll make this recipe many times!  Thank you very much, Carla!!

This was a very easy and tasty slow cooker chicken recipe, just what I have been looking for.  I used a whole cut-up chicken, with the skin removed, and the meat just fell off the bone.  I love garlic, so I added 2 teaspoons of minced, and I used fresh lemon juice, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  I did find that after browning the meat, it didn't take 6 hours to cook on low, it was more like 4 1/2, but with all the liquid, the meat didn't dry out.  I also used my fat skimming measuring cup to get rid of the small amount of chicken fat, and then used cornstarch to thicken the gravy, making it a relatively low fat dish.  Would be very good over egg noodles.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was not impressed with this one.  My husband said he liked it though.  The kids didn't eat it so that means I'll probably not make it again.

This was delicious!!! I added the 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 cup lemon juice and chicken broth. After the chicken was cooked, I removed chicken and I put Wondra in the liquid to thicken it up then put the chicken back in for a few minutes, while the linguini pasta cooked. Will definitely make this again!

To jemclerran you can buy any type of white wine. You should always cook with wine you will drink. They also sell small juice box servings of wine that you can use for cooking. Use as much as you need and then put the cap back on and put it in the fridge for the next recipe. They work really well. Hope this helps.

These was a super easy recipe with few ingredients.  I cooked this for 4 hours on low.  The chicken was very tender and fell apart with a fork.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I know this is not 'pc', but I used legs and thighs and left the skin on.  Very juicy.  Next time I'll add carrots and potatos to the pot.  YUM!

I only gave 3 stars because it came out dry but it could be that my slow cooker is big - I knew I should have added more liquid.  Also had a friend lift the lid on me to see what I was cooking (grrrr lol).  Great flavor but next time I will double the liquid in this if not triple so it's more moist and do the low and slow method rather than 3 hrs on high.  I think I overcooked it.

Pretty good as written. Added a bit more broth and used more of the oregano mixture. I think I may try adding capers at the end next time just for a little more zing. Maybe more garlic, too...And might try cutting up the chicken into bite size pieces since the sauce is the best part. And throw in broccoli or green beans for the last half hour to make a one pot meal over rice or noodles...

This was amazing. The chicken was very tender with a great flavor. The only thing I omitted was the salt; didn't need it. I also added a little more water. Mixed in some steamed vegetables for a perfect meal.

Big hit with everyone!  I use a little garlic powder in addition when i rub the chicken.  I add some white wine when making the liquid mixture.  Just before i serve... I remove the chicken and I thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry and put the chicken back in to get coated with the gravy.

I think that this turned out great! I did take various people recommendations: 1. Doubled the garlic, salt/pepper, oregano & water. I put enough water to cover the chicken to stay moist and they certainly did. Some mentioned it was too garlic-y and lemony with the  original measurements for the recipe but I'd have to oblige on that. It's all on the individual's taste buds & preference. I cooked it on low for the 6hr's and it was juicy, tender, and flavorful with the doubled ingredients. I will make it again!

I don't rate much 5 stars. We ALL loved this!! I used 4 boneless chicken breast halves, but we like things quite flavorful so i ran out of spice mix and made more till I could cover them well with it then rubbed it in as well as I could. I didn't have garlic cloves so I used quite a bit of garlic powder, and exchanged the water and bouillon for chicken broth, as per other reviews. I added an extra dash of lemon juice, since I love the lemony taste. Will make frequently, a new favorite!! Thanks!!

This recipe is delicious and pretty easy.  I usually brown the chicken and mix everything up the night before, and then slow cook it the next day.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, but I didn't think it was lemony enough, so since then I have added more lemon, between 4-5 tablespoons.  We have added this recipe to our regular rotation; I've made it several times now.  I always seem to forget the fresh parsley at the end.  One of these days, I will remember.  But it is delicious without.

One of the best chicken slow cooker recipes I have made.  Didn't have that cream-of-whatever soup, boil in the bag taste at all!  I made just as indicated, except I added more garlic and some shallots, used veggie broth instead of water and bouillon.  Probably would have been better after 2 1/2 hours on high ... 3 hours was slightly too long.

This turned out really good! The only things that I changed was to double the spices and add additional liquid.  The only thing that I am going to change next time is to cut down on the cook time. The 6 hrs on low just about dried it out.

I was looking for a very simple recipe.  I decided to take this recipe and make it just a little bit easier.  I skipped the browning of the chicken.  I threw frozen boneless breasts into the crockpot.  Dissolved the bouillion in hot water and added lemon juice and garlic powder to it and then poured over breasts.  Mixed the other seasonings and sprinkled on the breasts and the dotted with butter.  It was super easy and very tasty.  Even my 8 year old liked it.

Per my husband "nice flavor", but I overcooked my chicken so it was a bit dry.  But I doubled the sauces and then thickened with cornstarch, so we had extra gravy.  Served with brown rice and green beans.  Will make again, thanks for the recipe!

Didn't have time to brown the chicken, but will definitely try this the next time as I think it will only add to the flavor of the chicken and the gravy.  Took the chicken out of the crock pot when done and added a rue to thicken the sauce and wha-la it was great.  Will definitely add to my recipe rotation!

This was great - all I had was a bag of frozen chicken tenderloins so I used them. I used chicken broth and added some white wine, lemon juice and put in crock pot for only 2 hrs. Cooked a box of pasta roni and served over that. My 12 year old son said it was the best pasta he'd ever had. I'd definately make this again.

I did no prep *I didn't have the time*. I just added my ingredients to the crock pot. Since I was going to be leaving it all day I doubled the water and butter and also added fresh mushrooms...yum, yum, yum

Easy and so delicious! Thanks so much for the easy weeknight dinner! This makes the whole house smell wonderful while it cooks. 3 hours was a little long on high; 2.5 would have been better for my crock pot.
I served the chicken over jasmine rice cooked with some olive oil and Italian herb blend. I spooned some of the sauce from the crock pot on top, and it was so good. The amount of sauce was just right for 3 breasts. Next time I may try doubling it and thickening it to a gravy.

This came out fabulous!  Moist and tangy, but not overpowering.  I didn't have bouillion, so I replaced the water in the recipe with chicken broth.  Thickened the crock pot juices with a little Wondra flour and served it over the chicken and some rice.  Mmm, Mmm! Thank you Carla

This is a fantastic recipe for easy but great tasting chicken dish! Just put together, drop in the crock pot, and presto dinner is outstanding!! There are a lot of variations to making this dish great and different at the same time. Adding white wine, using lemon pepper and for some of us, reducing the salt when using the boullion cubes.

I thought this recipe was delicious, as did my husband and four year old daughter!  I used juice from a fresh lemon and added the lemon to the crock pot.  I had left-overs, and the next day, I made the most wonderful chicken salad with walnuts, celery and dried cranberries.  WONDERFUL!  I will absolutely make this again, and will try the suggestions listed in the reviews (especially adding white wine...)  Thanks for this great recipe and this awesome website!

I used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of boullion. The only problem with this recipe was that there wasn't enough! Goes great with rosemary or thyme new potatoes.

Like other reviewers, I had to add more liquid.  I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  I also added cooking white wine for a little zing and some whole garlic cloves to the crock pot.  Pretty good for something fast and easy! Served over rice with a side of veggies.

Oh man, I was so happy to find this recipe, it was so tender it melted in my mouth (waiting for husband to come home). Like everyone said (isn't this site fab) I had to add more bouillion to almost cover the chicken. I also added many unpeeled garlic cloves and even squeezed out lemon leftovers (Nigella Lawson idea for roasted chicken breast)...and the garlic turned out to be divine, melting in mouth even with peel. Well done!

This recipe makes fantastic chicken!  The first time I made it I used chicken quarters which definitely turned out more moist than another time when I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Lots of flavor and tender, delicious chicken.  I used the juices to make a simple gravy with a unique lemon flavor.  Definitely a keeper!  Great recipe for fall and winter.

I've made this so many times and it's always delicious. I would suggest doubling the sauce or adding more boullion and water to keep the chicken a little more moist while cooking. Also, about half way through cooking, I cut the chicken breasts into pieces so that they soak up a little more sauce. Great recipe...thanks!

Sorry, but I did not care for this ! Maybe I used to much oregano, but that was all I tasted. This recipe has made me kind of scared to try anything else with oregano in it. I used ground oregano, maybe I did something wrong :(

Great taste, but definitely needs more sauce as the garlic started to burn on the bottom of the slow cooker. I had to add more chicken stock halfway through.

Okay. A little dry. Make sure to brine the chicken first so it won't be do dry. and make the chicken thinner so you don't have to cook it as long so it won't dry out easier.

Pretty good!  My family enjoyed this meal, and it was certainly easy to prepare.  I did substitute chicken stock for the bouillion and water, and added a splash of white wine.  I ended up thickening the sauce at the end and served along with steamed brocolli (great with the sauce!) and herb rice.  Delicious.  I do think that there was just a bit too much lemon for my taste and will likely cut it back next time around.  Also will not need to cook quite so long for skinless boneless breasts.  We will be making this one again!

This chicken was soooo tender and had great lemon garlic flavor.  I did follow other peoples suggestions and did the following:  1) used chicken broth instead of water, 2) used enough chicken broth to cover the chicken completely in the crock pot, 3) cooked for 1/2 the time suggested, 4) added fresh sliced mushrooms (yum).  At the end because I had used so much broth, I put the liquid back in a skillet and used cornstarch to make it into a thicker gravy.  Again, yum.  What a great recipe!!!

This was very, very good. A nice change from the creamy chicken recipes. A few tips for first timers like me:
-Don't use too much rub on the chicken. I figured most of it would come off while cooking, so I used a lot, but it all stayed on!
-Like a lot of the comments on here, I added another 1/2 cup water and 1/2 tsp chicken granules and 2 tblsps lemon juice to make more juice.
-Next time, I will cut down on the garlic just a little.
I forgot to do the parsley and after all of these changes, it was a great meal with white rice--just perfect!

I have tried this and love it...it's something I can fix ahead of time and then when dinner time is here, I simply fix baked bread and side dishes.  My kids even like it!  My husband is picky, and he likes it, too.  I serve it over Uncle Ben's "chicken and wild rice" with some canned diced tomatoes (drained) and parmesan cheese.  It's very good!

I've made this a few times now and it's excellent!  The chicken cooks up so moist and the house smells wonderful.  I've found it's done in less than 3 hrs and you must be careful not to overcook it.  (I did use smaller/thinner boneless breasts so that could be a factor.)  It's so easy and tasty enough to serve to company!

Delicious. A little salty. Next time I will skip the salt. Will definitely be making again. I put it over angel hair pasta tossed in a little garlic butter sauce. Very tender chicken.

Absolutely loved this. I did tweak it lightly. I used chicken tenders instead if breast. I used 3 cloves garlic, a half stick butter, and two cups water. I also added lemon pepper seasoning to the dry mix. The meat was so juicy and I wanted to drink the liquid in the crockpot with a straw, but I refrained. It was that good?? 
 super easy and delicious!

This was absolutely delicious. I was low on black pepper so I substituted just a little bit of lemon pepper. Even though I had to cook it on high (I was short on time), this turned out amazing. It's perfect served over white rice and went well with a baked potato. Will definitely make it again, and it's "pretty" enough to impress guests!

Took several suggestions such as putting potatoes, onions and garlic in the bottom. Used bone in breasts and made a couple slits in the meat to help soak up flavor. I was missing oregano so I used Italian seasoning instead.  I didn't brown the meat either. This was a keeper. Flavor was good. It looked pretty too.  I took the sauce and boiled it down with cornstarch a bit of water and wine. I also put the leftover lemon from juicing in the crock pot which I actually wouldn't do again as i got a couple strong bites of lemon. I will defenatly make it again even with thighs maybe. I have always disliked chicken on the bone but this recipe changed that. The chicken was even frozen for at least 6 months and was still moist. The chicken sat out of the liquid because the potatoes were under. I thing that helped it not have that "crock pot" taste.

My family agreed the flavour was really good...used freshly squeezed lemon juice and a bit more of it than the recipe called for but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  However, it was so dry it was practically inedible.  We will make this recipe again but we will double the sauce ingredients (shouldn't it at least cover the meat?)and cook for half the time.

This was good.  To give it more lemon flavor , I added lemon pepper with the salt and oregano in the mixing bowl.  Kids liked it.

Made this recipe tonite; it was delicious. After browning the chicken, I cut each breast in thirds to reduce crockpot time (cooked about an hour & 15 minutes on high). I used 2 cans chicken broth instead of water & bouillon, which kept chicken covered the entire time). I served it with lemon caper cream sauce, rice, & asparagas. Even my super-picky daughter loved it. Yum! A new addition to my recipe box!

This was absolutely terrible! The chicken was so, so dry! I didn't brown it ahead of time either. I added extra butter, lemon juice, and spices. In addition to the chicken being dry, it would have been also very band had I not added a ton of extra spice. The sauce was greasy and thin. Can't see it going well with rice or pasta either, even if the chicken had been editable. No taste, dry, and just a big waste of time!

Liked it, but also dressed it up quite a bit for added flavoring. Used a medium sliced sweet vidalia onion and caramelized in a bit of butter; when tender, combined it with the liquids and seasonings on the stove top. Until warm. Used a total of 1 cup water & 1/4 cup of chablis cooking wine. (Note: substituted real lemon juice for bottled and thought the flavor was still good). Added a bit of garlic & herb seasoning to up the flavor. When chicken was tender, I removed the juices and brought to a boil with a little cornstarch to thicken. Will be making this again!

Really good recipe.  The chicken wasn't super flavorful, but the juice was awesome.  I added extra liquid, just as the other reviewers suggested, and then about 10 minutes before serving, I threw some white rice into the crock pot to soak up the goodness.  My (very picky!!!) husband said it was the best rice he's ever had!  The only thing that could have made it better is if the chicken's flavor matched the awesome rice.  Next time I'll try adding more liquid or less rice to see if that helps.

I have found a lot of great recipes on here, but this was not one of them. I ended up using the chicken broth like a few others did. The  flavor did not infuse into the chicken at all. There was almost no taste, other than the outside bites. I will not make again.

This was good. I liked the flavor. I did add significantly more liquid (Chicken stock) and also added some shallots. I have a large crockpot so it was imperative to add the liquid so that the chicken did not dry out. The chicken was perfectly moist. I made a roux with the leftover liquid and some flour and thickened it up slightly for a sauce.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written, EXCEPT that I added a little more oregano, salt, and pepper than it calls for.  It was ok, but not super great.  I thought the meat was a little bit dry, but my boyfriend didn't think so.  It had some flavor, but not a lot.  I didn't love it, but it was ok.  The boyfriend says to make it again, which is the seal of approval lol, but I probably will look at some reviews and get some ideas for changing the receipe before making it again.

This was really good for a slow cooker recipe. I increased the liquid by adding about a 1/2 c. of white wine and a little more water. I like to have lots of sauce at the end! I also added a little lemon zest. Instead of oregano, I used herbs de provence because I like the taste better. This was good. It was very lemony. We just put it on pasta, though I think it would probably be better on rice but pasta was faster. I think I will be using this one again.

Loved this recipe! I did make some changes, as I just put the breasts directly in the crock pot along with the ingredients and slow cooked it for about 6 hours. I prefer to make dinner around breakfast time so that I don't have to mess with it later. I also threw some carrots in with it and added some extra lemon juice and parsley flakes. AMAZING!

Really easy to fix and just let sit until ready to serve. We used tenders and served with rice and a side of fresh green beans. I only wish the extra sauce might have been thickened to make a light glaze (but since I do not know how to do it, we didn't get that wish).

This was so easy and so tasty! I only had frozen chicken breasts, so I threw everything into the crockpot at once and set it on low for 7 hours. The chicken turned out flavorful and tender.

Extremely good and VERY easy! I did add more water though, about two cups total, and used two bouillon cubes. I also doubled the garlic and used the juice of two lemons. I added about a teaspoon of Mrs Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning as well. When it was finished cooking, I removed the chicken and created a simple roux with flour and butter and made my own gravy with all of the left over juices without adding any other ingredients. I served it over brown rice and it was very hearty. I will definitely be making this again!

I tried to make this recipe for my family tonight with some of the adjustments suggested. It was awful. Not one of us, including my bottomless pit of a husband liked it at all. I couldn't even eat it. I don't know what this was supposed to taste like, but it was just a bitter yet bland mess.

This recipe was pretty easy, but not the strongest of flavors.  I substituted a whole chicken, and naturally it took about 2 or 3 hours longer than stated, but the chicken came out moist and tasted okay even though it was not fully submersed.  I will make this again.

This is a very tasty meal.  I overcooked the chicken so it was a little dry but still very flavorful.  I would recommend decreasing the cooking time.  I read the other reviews and used some white wine.  Great!

This is an easy way to cook chicken if you don't have time.  I use this recipe if I defrost chicken and then plans change and I don't have time to cook.  I just put it in the slow cooker and then keep in the frig for sandwiches or freeze for making soup or another recipe later.

The dish was good, but nothing too spectacular. I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice which made it a tad bit too sour and half an onion chopped with the garlic.

We really liked this, and it was easy to prepare.  6 hours on low in the slow cooker, and we had perfectly seasoned, tender chicken for dinner.  Served with the lemon thyme rice from this site.

This was delicious.  I use "Better than Bouillon" which is in the soup section of the store and comes in a jar and is more of a paste.  I use the chicken flavor (comes in low salt form too) and I find it tastes so much better than the granules or cubes.

Wanted to do something quick and easy with chicken so I followed the recipe but changed the method, cooked the chicken in the pan a little longer, when it was done added a little more broth and water to the pan with some par boiled potatoe, then everything in the oven in a covered pan for 20 mins at 35, turned out fantastic!!!! This chicken is also wonderful on top of a ceaser salad !

Loved these!!  I used a can of chicken broth instead of the chicken granules and added about 1/3 cup of white cooking wine.  Let them cook overnight on low in the crockpot.  I then shredded the chicken for use in greek gyros.  DEEELISH and so easy!

My hubby and I made this Lemon garlic chicken-it was WAY easy...and tasty too....I, like others, use chicken broth instead of bullion cubes and im glad i did.it would have been WAY too salty.  I think, with some tweaking-it could be really, really tasty...too much oregano and too much salt...not enough lemon flavor...but still a good start! I made chicken broth mashed potatoes to go along w/ and it was a hit...i was the only one that had any real problem with the 'too muchness' of some of the ingridents....

Used 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper instead of pepper and white wine to deglaze pan.  Increased water to 1/2 cup.  So aromatic and delicious to eat.  Used broth to moisten meat for serving.

Good stuff. Added a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan, then added about 1 1/2-1 3/4 cup water. Had to thicken up the sauce on the stove, but still worth it. Chicken nice and tender--loving my crockpot for that!!

This did not turn out well.  I doubled the sauce as recommended by several other reviewers otherwise, I made it as written.  It was very bland.  The chicken didn't take on the flavor of the sauce and the chicken was dry.  I will not be making this one again.

This had a great lemony flavor, but I guess that's why its called "lemon garlic chicken!"  I cooked mine on low for about 6-7 hours, and it was perfectly done.  I used 3 boneless chicken breasts and two thighs with bones.  I also added a bit of onion to the crock pot and a bit more black pepper.  Served it over rice.  I will use the chicken tomorrow to make a pulled chicken barbeque, as it is very tender and will easily shred with a fork. Not ohmygod wonderful, but very nice.  Thanks for sharing.

I had a dish at a diner called Chicken Diane & it was so amazing... I've never been able to find it again OR find a recipe - and this recipe is spot on with a few additions per the suggestions of the other chef n' raters:

1st step: used garlic pepper and kosher salt instead of just salt and pepper. Oregano as indicated.

2nd step: I used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of white wine, 4 tsps of jarred garlic, juice from one whole large lemon. Follow rest per recipe.

3rd step: take a strained 4 oz jar of Goya artichoke hearts and 6 oz of fresh mushrooms with chicken breasts in cooker on low for 1 hour and high for 1 hour. There will be a lot of sauce so after its cooked take the meat and vegs out of liquid and on stove with 3 tbsp of corn starch to thicken then back into crock pot for 30 minutes.I took 1 whole cup of the sauce in this liquid and added it to the rice. AMAZING AND LEMONY. Tasted just like the diner I ate at. Nailed it.

Delicious! I tweaked it a little (added about 1TB honey to sauce before adding to crock pot, added dill weed, extra cracked black and red pepper, extra water...) and i never really measure ingredients (unless Im baking) but this came out amazing! I thickened the sauce left in crock with some cornstarch and ladled it over the chicken and some veggie noodles- everyone loved it! I will cut back on the salt next time though... or probably skip it all together as the bouillon is salty enough for our tastes.

I enjoy using a slow cooker and use it frequently due to my scheduled. I tried this recipe and even used white wine, 1/2 cup lemon juice along with real stock as suggested by so many reviewers, but it came out very bland. I ended up re-seasoning the chicken after slow cooking and putting it under a broiler to add flavor.

This is a family favorite. First time I made it it turned out dry, but I have an unusual crock pot. I have adapted the recipe since my family likes a lot of Mediterranean flavors. I use 1 cup of water, the juice of two large lemons and 3 chicken bouillon cubes. I cook on low for about 4 hours, but I have an unusual purple clay crock pot in China that will boil water on high. Chicken broth would probably be better, but it is expensive overseas. Anyway, we slice this up, make some tzatziki sauce and wrap in pita bread.

I cooked it on low for 3 hours, chicken was really moist. Added a little more lemon but other than that didn't need any extra liquid. The chicken was flavourless, literally. If I make it again, I'll make a sauce out of the cooking liquid (the liquid was very flavourful).

The only modifications I made was that I added capers and scallions, used an Italian herb blend as opposed to just oregano and I cooked it with the lemon. As others suggested I increased the liquid by deglazing the pan with 1/2 cup white cooking wine and 1 cup water. Although the chicken was very tender, it did have a bit of a bitter after-taste and the liquid was so bitter I didn't bother trying to thicken it in a gravy. Maybe it was because I threw the lemon in the crock pot-- but it just had a bad bitter taste. Be careful about how much lemon you use. I wish I would have heeded the warnings of others about this. Not sure if I'll try it again.

I should have read other reviews before making -- I followed the recipe exactly and after a few hours, had to add extra water. It still ended up a little bit dry. 

I'd make this again, but with a number of modifications to increase liquid and a little bit of flavor.

I did not like this at all and was very sad that it didnt turn out.. I maybe because I followed one review to use chicken tenders and I think it may have been better if I had used thighs..they are more moist and this turned out dry.. I doubled the sauce except for the juice and the sauce was okay. I am afraid to try again.

This was ok...I would have liked more lemon garlic taste and the chicken was overdone in 1 1/2 hours in low (in my crockpot anyways). Faster and easier just to make lemon garlic chicken in a skillet...less to clean as well!

I agree with the majority...sauce is tasty but needs to be thickened.  I added corstarch with the remaining of the liquid and it made a nice gravy.  Will make it again with a few adjustments that's why I only gave a 3 out of 5

I modified this recipe to save time. Instead of using the croc pot, I browned the chicken in olive oil and 2 TBS butter, then added the rest of the ingredients to the pot and simmered with the lid on for about 20 minutes. After the chicken was cooked, I added fresh broccoli to the lemon/garlic/chicken juices and cooked for 5 minutes. The sauce added a wonderful flavor to the broccoli!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I followed it exactly and although it was very easy, it turned out pretty dry. I cooked it on low for six hours, so if I make it again, I may try cooking it for 3 on high.

Loved it. I deglazed the pan with white wine and used broth instead of bouillon. I used the juice of one lemon and extra garlic. I cooked this on low for five hours; even though the liquid didn't cover the chicken completely, it was still fork tender and flavorful. Definitely dump some of the sauce onto the chicken to serve--yummy. The chicken goes so great with a side of rice and greens.

This was awesome! I used huge bonless chicken breasts and they were falling-apart tender.  I also used the extra drippings to make a gravy and it all was so delicious! Thank you again for a fast and yummy recipe!

This was great. I think the lemon juice is too much. I have a lemon tree and eat a lot of lemons...this amount overwhelmed the otherwise tasty dish.  Maybe cut it down to 1/4 cup and no more. I did do what others mentioned and add in white wine...such a nice addition. Very elegant meal. I made this with homemade Potatoes Au Gratin, and Roasted Asparagus.

This recipe is delicious!  I did tweak it just alittle.  I added Montreal Chicken seasoning with the oregano and pepper, leaving out the salt.  I also ended up adding quite a bit more water and chicken broth.  I only have a big crock pot, and I needed enough liquid to cover the chicken so it wouldn't dry out.  Also, I added about half a bag of egg noodles for the last 25 minutes or so.  Yum!  My one year old son loved the noodles, and my husband loved the whole dish.  I made the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce, which I used to top the noodles.  I threw the chicken on top of that and voila!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Next time need to brown the chicken and make sure I put the rub on it.  I think that would have made the difference, even though other reviewers said they liked it without.  Added red potatoes and broccoli and the broth gave it a nice flavor.

This recipe was a little disappointing.  I have always loved the way meals turn out in my crockpot and this was the first that I did not care for.  I took the suggestions from the other reviews, using white wine to deglaze the pan and adding lemon pepper spice to the chicken dredge.  This dish is fairly flavorless and my chicken completely shredded after 4 hrs of cooking.  I think I'll stick to my "tried and true" chicken crock pot recipes instead.   I recommend BBQ pulled chicken instead.  Very flavorful and sure to please  crowd.  Just put chicken breasts in crockpot with 1/2 a sliced onion and enough BBQ to coat, delicious!

This was just ok.  I think there is too much sodium going on in this recipe with the chicken bouillon, lemon, and salt.  It needed another flavor component to balance the sodium.  It was moist but i dont think we'll be making again.  It did get finished, but we've had better..

This tasted great, but was too dry, and I had it in the crock pot for 4 hours.  So next time I'll try 3 hours.  I also added a little cornstarch to the liquid to make a sauce for the chicken and served with rice.

My husband & I both loved this.  It was simple enough for even me to make.  I added a full cup of water like suggested by others.  And I didnt have any bouillon so I used 2 packets from chicken Raman noodles.  I added lemon pepper and Montreal Chicken seasoning (by McCormic) to the rub.   And added more lemon then called for & next time will add even more.  My perfect cook time for was 2 1/2hrs on low.  The chicken came out juicy & flavorful.

I made this before I read any reviews.  The chicken needed much more liquid to keep from drying out in the cooker.  I used water with the chicken bouillon.  Also it was done in 3 hours on low.  It was very tasty and we used the left overs in stir fry the next night.

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time, I made it as directed, except, I used canned chicken stock and juice of 1& 1/2 lemons (didn't measure the amount of juice).  I added everything to the slow cooker- and I thought the chicken was a bit dried out- but with good flavor.  The sauce did NOT cover all the chicken- that's why I think it dried out.
Then last night I made the recipe again...but rather than putting it all into the slow cooker, I removed the browned chicken from the fry pan, then  added the liquid ingredients to the fry pan to deglaze, and then returned the chicken to the original fry pan, covered it, reduced the heat, and let it all simmer until the chicken was cooked through.  Once the chicken was cooked all through (about 20 minutes), I again removed the chicken to a serving dish,and then added a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I tasted it- it was a bit strong- so I added a bit of water to dilute.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and served with broccoli and rice.  Totally gone!  Now, not THE VERY BEST- but very quick, easy, and the gang ate it up!  I will definately make again...just without the slow cooker!

This was a good chicken dish, but it wasn't "bowl me over and knock me down" good.  It was tasty, but a bit boring.  I'm not sure I'll make it again.  There are so many other slow cooker chicken recipes that I would make over this one.  I think the best part is that I had everything on hand to make this, and it was very easy.

I used 4 lbs. of chicken quarters (bone-in, skin on) so I increased the amount of lemon juice and water.  I didn't have dried oregano, so I substitued a mix of dried italian seasoning, poultry seasoning and lemon pepper.  Overall, great flavors.  I made enough chicken to use the leftovers in empanadas the next day.  Great recipe!

This smelled fantastic while it was cooking, and was fall-apart tender when served.  Contrary to what other reviewers have said, it is very important to brown the chicken before putting it in the crock pot - this seals in the juices so the meat stays moist and tender.  I do have to say, though, that flavor-wise it seemed like something was missing, although I can't really put my finger on it.  Maybe some onion (or a tsp or two of onion soup mix)?  I served it with rice and steamed veggies.  It really was good, but just seemed to need a little something to complete the flavor.  I will definitely make it again, but play around with the recipe to see if I can figure out what's missing.

This wasn't as good as I was hoping. The chicken did not seem to take on the flavor of the sauce and it was a little dry. I reduced the cooking time by about 2 hours and it was still dry. Perhaps if you marinate the chicken it would be better.

This recipe has a good flavor but way too dry.  I doubled the sauce and cooked it on low for 4 hours.  Next time I'll try 2  1/2 or 3 hours.

Easy, fast and delicious!  I used about 1/4 cup of lemon juice though and doubled the water. I also only used 1 lb of chicken instead of 2, and the liquid covered all the chicken so it didn't dry out at all.  I think chicken tenders work better than chicken breasts because they maintain more flavor.  Great served over white rice.

I took some other poster's advice and substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillion - enough broth to almost cover the chicken in the crock pot. The chicken was so juicy and falling apart, and I put the leftover juice into a gravy boat for pouring over the chicken at the dinner table. Mmmm Mmmmm!!!! The next time I'm going to try puting some potatoes in.

I was surprised at how good this was, and how moist the chicken was.  I used a little extra lemon juice and chicken stock, and I accidently cooked it an extra couple of hours, but it was still moist.  It would be great over rice.

This is SO yummy!  I've used this recipe many times and my husband always comments on how good it is.  It does take a bit of work as you have to brown the chicken first, but it's so worth it!  I do make some alterations:  I add a little white wine, double the seasoning mixture, add extra bouillon as others have suggested, and use bone-in thighs intead of breasts.  The meat is extremely tender, falls off the bones.

With some adjustments, this is a great recipe; make certain the chicken is covered in liquid for the entire cooking time so that it is tender--I crocked it on low for about 5 hours and it was extremely moist and tastey. I ended up adding 2 cans of broth rather than the water and bullion. I also added almost a cup of lemon juice from a bottle. In the end, I threw in some mushrooms and artichokes--it was very good but almost a different recipe by the time I was done.

My family loves this recipe.  I've changed a few items to suit our garlic and lemon tastes.  I cut up fresh lemon in round slices and cover the bottom of the cooker.  I add about 20 fresh cloves of garlic then layer the chicken on top.  I add another layer of lemon and garlic cloves.  I also used broth rather than water.  The chicken is so tender!

This recipe was excelent! I have made it a couple of times. The second time i made it i made more oregano, salt, and pepper for the rub. And instead of using regular salt i used seasoned salt. I also added some Mrs. Dash Lemon pepper.

Not something the kids really enjoyed, but my husband absolutely loved it and wants it again. I thought it was tasty too, and will definitely oblige him. I love slow cooker recipies, and it's nice to find one that doesn't have the usual cream of mushroom soup or onion soup mix. This one is nice enough for company!

As simple as recipes come, excellent way to fix chicken with ingredients that you have on hand.  A little too much lemon for me, but my husband and kids loved it!

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RECIPE! It was very moist and had lots of original flavor to it. I did make and add a few changes but nothing to completely alter the recipe. 

I used 2 1/2 cups of water instead of 1/4. This made it less dry and seemed to add more flavor. Instead of using 2 cloves of garlic, I used about 4 and it was just right! I also added onion and quartered potatoes before I added the chicken to the crockpot and it was the absolute best! You can really add anything to the chicken such as pasta, rice, vegetables, potatoes, etc. 100% recommend!

Very good recipe. My husband really enjoyed it, too. I cooked the chicken breasts on high in my slow cooker. They were done in 2 hours instead of 3. For sure I will make this recipe again.

This came out dry and bland. I even cooked it in a shorter time and on low. It looked appealing and wasn't "bad". i did add a little chicken broth and some sliced onions which helped a little, this recipe would be fine as a base to make your own changes to...I guess we just prefer stronger flavors here and a juicier chicken recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly because I didn't have an extra ingredients to throw in except potatoes.  I don't really like oregano so I should have left it out.  I found it to be the overpowering taste and I barely tasted the lemon which is what I was looking for. My youngest son liked it, my older son not so much and this is a pass for me.  It's just not my thing.

Great taste. 
I read some of the reviews and took the advice of one and added more lemon. 
I think I will stick to the original proportions next time. 
WARNING: 3 hours on high produced very dry chicken breasts. 
Next time I will start on high 1 hour maybe  and 2 on low.  This is my reason for 4 stars. Dry chicken breasts are not good. The sauce made them edible.

Excellent dish!! Took other reviewers advice and used lemon pepper which added a zing.  Served with brown rice.  Like sauce so I increased water and bouillon and lemon juice.  At the end I took out sauce and thickened with cornstarch on stove top.

I used chicken thighs because that is what I had available. Delicious recipe and so easy to adapt for a lactose intolerant person in the house. The only thing I changed was to double the sauce. Not sorry I did that as it is delicious over top of spaghetti. This is such an easy recipe to make.

This recipe was solid, although not magical or anything. I did modify it, as a few other reviewers suggested, because I thought it would be more boring without some additions. I doubled the oregano, added an extra clove of garlic and a chopped shallot, and used 1/2 c. white wine in addition to the water/bouillon. After removing the chicken, I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Next time I want to try adding some button mushrooms and serving the chicken and sauce with angel hair and arugula because it reminded me of a restaurant dish that I like!

This recipe lacks in flavor and I think the browning of the chicken is a pointless step. It's got way too much salt too.

Very easy to make, it was so tender. Something told me that just salt and pepper wouldn't give it enough flavor so I put some of my own seasoning and it tasted so good. I would make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and was not impressed. Something seemed off?? I think it was my slow cooker? I will use a smaller crock pot next time. For this recipe I used a 6 quart crock pot cause that was what I had at the time. This left the chicken a bit dry. Recently went out and purchased a 4 quart crock pot and will try that. Overall the dish was okay.

Really moist chicken.  We enjoyed the flavor.  I did add more water (1 cup), so that I could make a sauce for the pasta I served along side.  Wasn't crazy about having to brown the chicken before placing in the slow cooker.  I like to just throw everything in & go.  I'm wondering if results would be the same if not similar if I just cooked it all up in the saute pan??  I might try it that way next time.  Who needs extra dishes to wash anyway?

We really enjoyed this recipe! Instead of just oregano, I used Italian seasoning and only half a cube of chicken bouillon. Before I put it in the slow cooker, I cubed some red potatoes and placed them in the bottom for the chicken to cook over. Husband was a huge fan!

Made this for dinner tonight. It was pretty good. I had to add a bit of corn starch at the end because it was a bit watery. Good flavor though. The chicken was very tender. Didn't need a knife. I served it over noodles. I would make this again.

Pretty good.  You can hardly go wrong with a crock pot recipe!  Due to some of the reviews, I doubled the sauce and threw the ingredients in a pan and boiled for a bit, added a can of chicken broth, and then poured it on top of my salted and peppered chicken breasts (I did not want to precook the chicken.)  It cooked up nicely in the crock pot (mine was not dry at all as I had enough liquid to completely cover the chicken and I cooked it 8 hours on low,) but I found it to be too lemony so I added just a bit of sugar, maybe one tsp, and a nice couple of shakes of garlic powder as you could not taste the garlic at all.  After it was done, I poured the juices from the chicken back into a pan to come to a quick boil and thickened it with corn starch.  It was still pretty lemony but it went well served over egg noodles.  It was a nice lite tasting summer dish which all enjoyed.  Thank you!

Why this is a crock pot recipe, I have no idea.  Could have been done in a skillet very easily and would have been moist.  I followed the recipe and the chicken turned out very dry.  Maybe should have been marinated then cooked in a skillet.

This was just ok. It may have been that I used thin-cut chicken breast, but it turned out super dry with the little liquid that the recipe called for.

This was good, but it was done in only about 3 1/2 hours on low!  Thank goodness I checked it.  I think it may be because my chicken breasts were small and got mostly cooked through in the browning process.  Unlike many reviewers I left the amount of liquid the same, which was a fine amount for the cooking process, and at the end there was a little more from the juices.  In my opinion this was the best part, served over rice.

So delicious and really easy! Tried it with the addition of the white wine but think it would only need 1/4 cup as opposed to 1/2 cup. Didn't use boullion, used chicken stock and then at the end thickened with a little corn starch as suggested by other reviewers. Definitely only needs a max of 2 hours on high and 1 on low. Will add to the regular rotation!

Super moist chicken! All of my favorite picky eaters ate every bite. I will definitely be making this again. I followed the recipe, not the video. My household will not eat mushrooms or cooked carrots. I fed them steamed broccoli (for whatever reason they will eat this, but not cooked carrots) and cut up oranges instead.

I make this,with a cup of chicken broth not the dried.If you use bone-in chicken pieces, there will be more flavor than with boneless.  The browning gives flavor and colour to the dish. I often add a little paprika to the browning spices, which gives a nice colour and it looks more appetizing ! My husband loves this dish !

I have the tendency to not follow the AMOUNT of the given ingredients and this recipe was no exception, but it turned out GREAT! With the dry ingredients, I kind of just dumped, tapped or sprinkled depending what I felt it needed. I also used 5 chicken breasts because of my family size, which is more than 2 pounds, so obviously I had to adjust the ingredients. For the one person that I saw that complained of it being dry, it's because they DIDN'T brown it first because apparently the don't know how to add extra butter. The browning it gives it a solid outside and seals in the moisture. I used EXTRA butter and it sealed in the moisture GREAT. This was moist, juicy and tasted FANTASTIC! This has been added to our favorite meals! I also used jarred garlic instead of cloves. Don't know if that made a difference but once again, it tasted FANTASTIC!

I loved this recipe and so did my entire family of 12.  One  said that it was so delicious that it tasted like a 5 star meal from a restaurant. Knowing my family, I tripled the recipe and used 3x the ingredients.  I used 2 1/2 cups of homemade chix broth, added 3 bouillon cubes and added 3 cups water for the bouillon cubes. I used the broth to make rice as a side dish. I also used extra broth to make gravy.  I will definitely use this recipe again! lovetocook

I didn't brown the chicken, just threw it all in the crockpot.  The chicken was full of flavor and super moist.  I shredded it and have been adding it to dishes throughout the week.  Thanks!

I thought this was excellent. Chicken came out very flavorful, moist and tender. Only suggestion is for me I would add a bit less oregano next time. Might even add some capers at the end? Or try it with rosemary and thyme in place of the oregano.

Quite unlike the moist chicken promised by the recipe, my chicken was so dry it was difficult to eat. Instead of serving the breasts as the center of the meal, I improvised and heated the cooking liquid on the stove, turning it into a soup broth. I added chicken stock, some honey, and thickened the mixture with two egg yolks. I poured the broth over the shredded chicken, steamed carrots, and brown rice. In the end, it was good, but quite different from the original recipe. I recommend dramatically reducing the cook time for tender chicken--no more than 4 hrs on low heat.

I doubled up all the seasonings and boiled the mix then poured it over the uncooked chicken. I would not suggest lemon pepper on this though. I also went the route of chicken broth in a 14.5 oz can. After 2 hrs I added a diced sweet onion then cooked for 2 more. Turned broth into a gravy and served over rice.

This is actually a very good chicken recipe--lots of flavor and a bit different than the usual.  Four stars is simply because the lemony flavor did not appeal to my family as an entree, but I can definitely see using this chicken in other recipes, such as chicken salad.

Great recipe. I used the recommended oregano, salt and pepper but changed to 1 cup of chicken broth, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, the juice of 1 whole lemon, 1 teaspoon of dried parsley, no bouillon, no butter, no water, and no browning in the skillet. I served it over buttered rice.  It turned ot great. I will make this again and again.

Great in flavor! I used three thighs and it wasn't enough, next time I'll use 6.  I used just under a cup of water, I'll have to increase it to 1.5 next time. Cooked it on low for 4.5 hrs after pan frying, and it was perfect!

Soooo good!  I decided to make this for my salad.  I didn't really read the directions and ended up throwing everything in the pot all at once (with extra garlic OF COURSE) and then let it simmer on low for around 9 hours and it was amazing!  The chicken is tender, the lemon isn't overpowering and the flavors mix together beautifully.  This one's a keeper!

Made this as is...actually added extra liquid. 6 hours on low got me completely dried out boneless, skinless chicken. I will need to monitor more closely and not go as long. The juice/gravy was delish!

Good recipe.  The chicken was so tender.  I took another's advice and added an extra cup of water.  Do the same becuase you will burn the chicken if you don't add more liquid.  Also, If you want to taste the lemon or garlic, add more.

Delicious. Kid friendly, at least for my kids.
Easy, flavorful.  And no cream soup, yay!  I saute'd the chicken with some white wine added to the butter in the pan.  I added a cup of broccoli during the last 30 minutes along with another couple shakes of oregano.

This recipe was UNBELIEVABLY delicious!!  Thanks for sharing it Carla Joy.  I did not have garlic cloves on hand so I used garlic powder.  I took the advice from others and deglazed the pan with white wine.  I doubled the sauce and then thickened it with cornstarch and served the chicken with brown rice.

Like others I 3X the sauce and added a little corn starch at the end. This was really good. Kind of a light but tangy chicken. Most slow cooker chicken recipes are kind of heavy and this is a nice change. I'll certainly be using it again. Thanks for sharing it.
I've made this several times now. I pretty much have turned it into a soup. I shred the chicken, up the liquid and spices and it makes a different and very tasty chicken soup.

I was really looking forward to this dish but very disappointed.  I cooked it 3 hours on high per one of the options and the chicken was VERY dry.  I read the reviews and added more liquid (chicken broth) but did not seem to matter.  I will try this again, and try cooking on low for 3-6 hours and see what happens.  This kitchen smelled wonderful as it cooked but no one as happy with the meal.  My husband even put a large piece of his chicken back.

Made on stovetop, cooked chicken breasts in broth and added sage, garlic, thyme & rosemary, pepper.
Added carrot, celery, frozen peas.  Simmered torn biscuit 1 hour till it was done.  Thickened with a little flour.  Was very good.

Followed other reviewers suggestions and used 2 cups of water with the bouillon dissolved in it and added 2 cups of Swanson chicken broth. Turned out really well. I also added chopped onion and lemon pepper seasoning when I browned it in the skillet. I think I am going to try baking this next time, the crockpot made it a little drier than we like, but still very good!

Well, I actually managed to add too much liquid!  So I simmered the sauce until half gone and added some cornstarch slurry.  Perfect!

This wasn't great for us. It was a bit bland, and the flavor that was there seemed a bit odd. Probably won't be in our regular rotation, but glad we tried it. Thanks for sharing!

When your 8 year old says that this is the best chicken he has ever eaten, and has 3 helpings...you are darn right I will be making it again.  It was delicious!!! I also deglazed the pan with the garlic and some white wine before adding the water and spices.  As well I added 2 cups of water instead of 1/4 so that I would have lots left for sauce over rice. I cooked it on low for 5 hours and it was perfect, but you could do it even less maybe 4 and it would still be great.

Absolutely delicious and a very light taste for summer cooking. I did double the amount of liquid in the crock pot to cook though. For a richer, creamier taste to the sauce (and to thicken it a bit) we experimented with some sour cream & cornstarch and it came out wonderfully. Will definitely be making this again!

I LOVED how this made my house smell while it cooked all afternoon! I ate it in a tortilla with lettuce and stuff, my one-year-old gobbled it up plain, and my three other pickies didn't like it. I enjoyed it, though!

this was very good, moist, and easy to make;  i think next time i will, like other posters, increase the amount of seasonings (oregano, pepper, parsley) and use chicken stock instead of water...i might even thicken it up a bit at the end to use as a gravy as opposed to a jus...my husband loved it, so this will definitely be a keeper---thanks!

I've made this recipe several times and the whole family loves it. I've made it with boneless, skinless thighs because that's all I've had on hand, so today's the first time I'm trying it with chicken breasts. I'm sure it will be as good.

What a great recipe.  I did not have the bouillon granules so, I substituted 1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth and left out the water.  This is a definite keeper.  Fiancee' loved it, too.  Served with brown rice.  Strained the liquid in cooker and used it over the rice which I shredded the chicken over.  YUMMY!

Very Good! I also had to add more water (and the white wine as well) to make enough broth to cover the chicken. Also added another 1/2 of bouillon cube to compensate.  Put it over whole wheat egg noodles and paired it with steamed carrots for some color. Mmmm....

I enjoyed this recipe, but i did make a few changes, i added a dash of cayenne pepper and a TBS of lemon pepper to the oregano mixture. I also added a half of an onion to the sauce mixture along with 3 TBS lime juice instead of lemon juice... It turned out wonderfully and my husband and baby girl loved it.

This wasn't bad at all. I followed the recipe. It wasn't too much lemon or too much of anything. If could change anything I would say to use more water, lemon juice, and bouillon to produce more sauce. I prefer it saucy.

Excellent recipe, just added a little more water (probably about 3/4 cup) and some corn flour at the end to thicken the sauce. Very tasty over pasta and my whole family ate it!

Very tasty! The chicken was nice and tender after cooking in the slowcooker.  I followed the recipe but I was very liberal with lemon juice and the chicken broth.

The chicken was really good.  Not really by itself though.   I think next time i'll make a chicken scampi or a pasta with the chicken.  It needed something.  Overall it was well received with the family.  Thanks.

This was FANTASTIC!  I loved it and my son ate it with no complaints which is awesome.  The only changes I made to this recipes are, I used the juice of 1 lg lemon, 1 can of chicken broth and a dash of lemon pepper seasoning.  We will be making this again and again and again!

This was very good.  I used 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth instead of water. Also used 2lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The chicken turned out very moist and flavorful.  After chicken was done, I added 1 1/2 cups Israeli couscous to the liquid (chicken removed).  It thickened after about 25 min and was delicious!

This was great! I used chicken broth and white wine. Didn't really measure anything, just threw it all in there and left it on high for 3 hours. Cut up some fresh parsley from my yard for the last hour on warm and it was really delicious. I served with a side of risotto and used the juices from the crock pot to enhance the rice flavor.

I marinated the chicken overnight with the spices in some wine rather than browning it. Put it in the crockpot on low for 6.5 hours. By dinner time it was tender, fell apart, and didn't dry out. I added cornstarch at the end to thicken the gravy. Served over white rice. Delicious!

This recipe was 5 stars when I made some minor adjustments and followed the advice of other reviewers.  I added rosemary to the oregano rub mix because thats what we were in the mood for today.  I also added chicken broth to cover while cooking and placed some mixed veggies in the bottom of the slow cooker before I put the chicken in.  Sensational.

This was great with a couple of changes.  After reading reviews I decided to use lemon pepper seasoning instead of salt & pepper.  I also used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  These were really big chicken breasts, and I had no trouble with them cooking on low for almost 7 hours while I was out.  They were falling apart and very tender.

I love "Fix-It and Forget-It" recipe's.  The original recipe uses Seasoned salt instead of plain salt, which tastes even better.  I have been making this chicken recipe forever!  I love it!!

I give this 5 stars for how easy, healthy, good and moist it was.  I too listened to the advice of others and added two cups of water and a dash of white wine.  I'm sure it would have been just as good without the wine but I happened to have it on hand.  I will be making this again.

This was wonderful!!! I used the juice from the whole lemon; other than that I didn't change a thing. I served it over whole wheat linguine and my family gobbled it up. I had to drag my 3 year old away from the table. Will make this many more times. Thanks!

It was good but not the best.  Personally I think it lacked some flavor.  I think next time I'll thicken the juices from crock pot then serve it over noodles or something.

I had to triple the liquids to get it to cover the chicken in the crock pot...

Based on others' reviews, I covered the bottom of the crockpot with sliced potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and a few cloves of garlic.  I tripled the sauce, used chicken broth instead of water, and also added a little white wine.
Watch the cook time though!  I cooked mine on LO for 3 hours. . . . the chicken seemed a little overdone while the potatoes were still a bit hard.  Maybe next time I will skip browning the chicken and just put it right in the pot, so I can leave it on LO for longer so the chicken and potatoes get done at the same time.

I followed the recipe, but also added more liquid, wine etc. Then, served it over egg noodles.  It tasted like chicken noodle soup.

4 stars only because it was a bit dry after 6 hours on low, but that is to be expected really.  I added 2 cups of water and it wasn't enough but the flavor was really good. I used fresh oregano (First of the summer!!) to the sauce and it made a great gravy.  I really enjoyed this recipe!

This recipe was pretty darn good and simple too. I did double the sauce mixture because I put halved red potatoes in the bottom of the slow cooker so I wanted to make sure there was enough juice to go around. I didn't put the sauce mixture into the skillet after I browned the chicken (I missed that part of the directions until I already had everything in there...oops). Definately can taste the lemon in the chicken, next time I make this i'll probably reduce the lemon juice by 1/2 a Tbl. to see how it turns out.

This was pretty good. I added some white wine, 2 additional cups of water and 1 additional bouillon cube.  Simple and went nicely with some brown rice and fresh veggies.

Pretty good, I used chicken thighs instead of breasts nad they are always done in an hour or two on high. I replace the water with white wine and put in the parsley.

I made this chicken using 3 lbs of chicken breast and 2 of thighs. I upped the lemon to the juice of 3 lemons(each lemon contains approximately 4 tbsp)and added a whole bulb of garlic to the crock pot. I served it with rigatti pasta, which soaked the wonderful sauce up perfectly. All of my family and friends LOVED this dish. Thank you for sharing this one!

This had amazing lemon flavor.  Added lemon pepper with the herbs over the chicken before browning.  Juiced one lemon and threw the rest in the liquid.  Used one can of chicken broth to cover the chicken and a few splashes of white wine.  Chicken came out very moist, falling apart after 5 hours.  Thickened up the liquid with a little corn starch.  Served over rice with broc/caul casserole (from this site) and some honey oat bread (also from this site).  It was the best meal I have made in awhile.  Definitely going to add this to my favorites.

This is an excellent recipe.  i created an acct just so i could write a review for it. although I added a little extra spice.  i also use limes instead of lemons and today when I am making it i am going to double the recipe so I will use one squeezed lime and I am going to slice another to put on top of the chicken in the crock pot.  I wonder how it will turn out, I guess ill know in 6 hours.  nonetheless excellent recipe!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  We did make the following alterations: used garlic salt instead of salt, doubled the lemon juice, put in 2 cups of water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes, and used a pinch of dried parsley instead of the fresh.  If you don't use more water, it will dry out...and you need to adjust the lemon juice and bouillon accordingly.  We had it with Uncle Ben's brown and wild rice medley and green beans. I will definitely make this one many more times!!

I prepared this dish with the "extra sauce" modification recommended by other foodies.  My family fairly swooned for it.  Even my 8 year old son, who is reluctant to try new things ate his entire portion.  This one is definitely a keeper.

My daughter and I are vegetarian but my son and husband thought it was great and asked me if I'd make it again sometime. I served it with broad noodles for my son and rice for my husband (feels like I work in a diner) along with a garden salad. Another great slow cooker recipe.

This was so yummy! My husband is very picky & said it was the best he's tasted. I made a thickened sauce with the liquid from the cooked chicken which was also very good. Thanks for the recipe! Will definetly make again.

I used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon granules and added in a splash or two of white wine. I didn't measure the lemon juice just used the juice from one smallish lemon. I thought I would have to add cornstarch at the end, but the sauce thickened quite well in the cooking time. Hubby really enjoyed this and he's picky. Thanks.

Used 4 legs and 4 thighs and it wasn't enough.  The chicken was gone in no time!  I'll double this and make it again.  I was worried at first about the lack of liquid I poured over the chicken after frying it but it was just right!  Sure enough, the chicken was done in 3 hours on high.  Ooops, forgot the parsley and didn't notice until I just checked the recipe now.

This was pretty good .  I used bone-in legs and breasts.  I used Italian season and Oregano and used chicken stock and a little white wine instead of just water.  The breasts were a little dry, but my husband said the legs were moist and tasted great.  Overall the flavor was good,  but something about browning chicken then placing it in the slow cooker so that crispy crust gets soggy seems a shame.  I will make this again but with a different cooking method.

This was pretty good, the meat fell off the bone (I used bone-in breasts) and there was plenty of flavor, but I agree that the liquid amounts need to be adjusted so that the meat is covered in the pot. I threw some sliced onion and baby carrots in the bottom and cooked on low for 6 hours; I think 5 would have been a little better. It tasted just like mom's homemade chicken soup - nothing wrong with that! - but if you're looking for something fancier, you might be a little let down by this one. Adding white wine really gives it a nice touch. I'll be making it again soon, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is delicious! I used others' suggestions and substituted chicken broth for the water and then poured more in the cooker to cover the chicken. I also added some white wine and left out the parsley. It was so wonderfully tender and juicy. I’m a very picky eater and my husband will eat most anything so this was a great dish to please us both! Made it with the Holiday Only Mashed Potatoes from this site and some lemon butter glazed green beans. I will say it takes longer than 15 minutes to prep though, I’d say more like 45. I will cook this over and over again!

Added Seasoned Salt to the rub and rolled the breasts in it.  To the liquid I added white wine with lemon so that the liquid was about half covering the chicken.  I also added an extra packet of chicken boullion.  Cooked in crock pot on low for 7-8 hours.  The chicken was fork tender, flavorful and easy.  Served with garlic cheddar mashed potatos and green beans.  Big hit with my garlic loving husband.  Will make again.

The flavor was good and the chicken quite tender, but like everyone else, I was surprised at how dry the chicken was.  I had to use the rub sparingly to cover all the chicken, you may want to double that.    My picky son liked this dish a lot so that's a big plus for me and I will probably make this again.  I will just add water or some chicken broth while cooking.

I followed this recipe exactly and at the end of three hours, the chicken was completely burnt and dry.  I won't make it again but if I did, I would certainly add more liquid.

The meat was very tender, but as far as taste goes, I expected more lemon flavor. But overall, it was easy and tasty. Next time I will add more spices, more garlic, and more lemon at the end. Good recipe. Thanks!

This is one of my family's favorites.  It's one of my favorites too because of the whole"fix it and forget it" crockpot aspect.  My husband and I both enjoy the garlic and lemon flavors of the dish.  Somewhat surprisingly to me, this is also a big hit with my 4 year old and 21 month old.  I think they like it so much because of how tender the chicken is.  Like many others, I did double the liquid in order to have enough to thicken it at the end for a gravy to serve over rice.  I also usually make this with chicken breasts still on the bone in order to cut the costs.

This chicken has great flavor and a nice tang to it. Served with mashed potatoes.  Followed the recipe except for the following modifications: 4 T. lemon juice, 1 Knorr chicken bouillon cube and 1 c. water.  Cooked on low in a 6 qt. cooker.  It was done by 5 hrs.  Probably should have checked at 4 1/2 since chicken was a little dry.  Will make again.

Pretty good with some additions: I used 3lbs thighs; I just think they turn out more moist. I left out the water, added in the zest of the lemon I'd juiced, 1 tsp dried rosemary, and 1/2 tsp dried mustard powder. After about 4 hours on low mine was done. The sauce was delicious, but too soupy, so I thickened it with some cornstarch/water. Seved with cous-cous...not bad at all.

I was looking for a chicken crock pot recipe that didn't have the cream soup as most do and I think this is a very tasty one. As others suggested, I used a half cup of chicken broth instead of the water and buillon. I also increased the lemon juice to 4 tbsp. I used italian seasoning instead of the oregano which I liked very much. I cooked it on low and checked it after it cooked for a little over 4 hours and found that it was already done (actually maybe just a little overcooked as it was starting to dry out). Although I was only cooking 2 chicken breasts. But other than being a little dry, it tasted great. I served it with white rice and asparagus and it made a woderful meal.

This chicken has a really great flavor.  I did mix in some thighs that had bones and breasts that were really thick, so I cooked this for 4 hours on high.  The meat was so tender it fell off the bone.  Great recipe!

I used a full can of chicken broth instead of water and chicken boullion and tripled all the other ingrediants exceot the garlic, of which I used 2 cloves.  I put individually frozen chix breasts in crock pot; mixed all other ingred (No butter) in bowl and poured over chix.  Cooked on low from 8-5:30.  I then thickened sauce with corn starch and served w/ pasta and parm.  My husband and I both enjoyed very much. Different and tasty.

My family really loves this recipe.  I use bone in, skinless chicken thighs and cook on low for 6-8 hours so I can make it early in the morning and forget it the rest of the day.  I also omit the browning step to save time and omit fat.  I double the liquid and use italian seasoning instead of oregano.  I also throw in 4 cups of frozen brocoli/cauliflower/carrrot mix during the last 40 minutes while I wait for the rice to cook in my rice cooker.   A family favorite.

Flavorful and easy recipe! This was one of 4 recipes I made for a dinner party for 30 people. I used about 6 pounds of chicken an I omitted the water and just used 2 cans of chicken stock instead. I made sure the chicken was completely covered and I cooked it on low for 8 hours.  It is best served along with something else instead of as the main entre, in my opinion.

Pretty good recipe. The chicken was so tender, it fell apart. I bit to garlicky for my family.  Next time, I will definitenly cut down on the garlic. After reading some of the other reviews, about the chicken being very bland, I added a little extra spice and lemon juice - as a result, the chicken had plenty of punch. If you love garlic, you will love this dish, otherwise, cut back a little on the garlic. (FYI I cooked this dish in my crockpot on high and it only took half of the time! Watch the chicken, because if it overcooks, it will be DRY)

sounded great as I am looking for a "great" slow cooker chic recipe. However...I added more spice and it still seemed just very bland to me. Nothing special and I won't be making this again.

Yes I used chicken broth instead of boullion granules.  I would have liked to add some white wine but didn't have any on hand at the time.  The flavour was great but it was cooked too long on low.  I think maybe 4.5 hours should be maximum and I did put sliced potatoes on the bottom and they were tasty.  Sliced them about 1/2 " thick.  I might up the garlic next time.  I used my garlic scapes that I just took of my garlic from my garden.

was making it for just me.  used 1/2  boneless chicken breast, but sliced into pieces.  used 1/4 c. chicken broth, a good squeeze of lemon, sprinkled some oregano over it, dried onion and some garlic.  simmered in little crockpot for 3 hours on low.  added mushrooms.  took chicken out, tasted and a bit dry.  use chicken thighs next time.    added cooked chicken to heat up when i was ready to eat.  i did add a dollop of butter at this point.  sprinkled chopped parsley over and served over a bit of cooked pasta.  dinner for one.  i would make again but would use chicken thighs. (i edited this review to say not to add cornstarch to thicken the bit of sauce.   i did and found it should be thin and juicy).

I added a side of Alfredo noodles and they made a very nice addition to the chicken. Chicken was a little on the drier side for my liking. I think next time I’m going to make it like the video says, with chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water mixture.

Sorry, this recipe did not work for us.  This sounded good so I tried it and served it on spaghetti pasta with a side of creamed spinach.   I chose the low crock pot setting for 6 hours.  It smelled good.  It looked like it would be delicious.  But it was completely bland.  There was a bit of work mixing spices, rubbing them onto the chicken, frying them in a skillet, and boiling the additional spices, bowl and skillet to wash...a lot of work for a crock pot dish.

I made the changes suggested by others, or it would have been no stars.  1/4 cup of water is not enough to turn on a crock pot!  I used close to a quart of liquid.  Deglazed the pan with 1 cup of wine as suggested. I added enough chicken broth to cover the breast and cook for 2 hours on high and 1 hour on low.  Next time, I will cook 1 hour on high and 2 hours on low.

Everyone ate it amazing this hasn't happened in a long time.
I used chicken stock instead of water added juice of one lemon and sliced another  thinly and added to slow cooker. I will use less oregano next time. The kids have asked that this be on our rotation  of  meals.
Thank you this recipe was easy and now an regular in lineup.

Loved this!  Served over pasta & broccoli using the broth as sauce overall.  Thickened the broth a little with arrowroot flour & Parmesan cheese before serving!  Definitely a recipe I'll keep as a favorite!

I made this tonight, and everybody loved how it turned out.  Tender chicken, great flavor!  I served it over angel hair pasta and sprinkled a little Locatelli cheese on top...Yum!  I did as many reviewers suggested and used more liquid.  I added a cup and a half of water and three chicken bouillon cubes.  I used the juice from one whole lemon and half of a lime.  I did the suggested two cloves are garlic, but I think next time I'll double that...the flavor was great, but I love garlic, so I'm going to add more next time and see how that turns out.  Oh, and I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and lightly fried a thinly-sliced shallot in the frying pan after I took the chicken out but before I added the liquid ingredients.  I am definitely adding this to my list of go-to dinners. :)

Other than adding a 1/2 tsp of paprika I made as directed. I cooked this on high for 3 hours and found the chicken a tad dry but the flavour was nice.

You guys this does not need any changes to be delicious. The only thing I substituted was a can of chicken broth in place of water.  And I had no lime juice so I just used one and half lemons to create three tablespoons.  It is the best grilled chicken slow cooker recipe I have tried and my very picky boyfriend "LOVED" it :)  This will be my go to

My husband & I made this for the first time last night & it's a winner!  We took a few of the suggestions in other reviews & added extra water & lemon juice.  We also use lemon pepper in the mix for the chicken before it went in the pot.  Cooked for 3 hours on high, place over angel hair pasta & was delicious!!! Chicken was moist & had lots of flavor.

This was really good. I used more apice than the recipe called for. I think browning and deglazing the pan brought additional flavour. it was very moist. I also used stock in a box instead of bouillon.

This is such a simple and straightforward recipe that you cant't go wrong. I didn't add anything however I did use chicken breasts with bone in. I think it has much more flavor and they really came out moist and falling off the bone. Delicious!

I made it as described and thought it came out bland and dry. I could barely taste the lemon which is so disappointing as that is why I picked this recipe! I will try it again but will definitely cut back on the boullion, as others said this made it way too salty for my taste. I will also be adding more lemon and cooking it for a lot less.

this was delicious...whole family loved it.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of the water, 1/4 cup of water isn't enough for a slow cooker, and squeezed a whole lemon into it.  Will absolutely make this again!

Followed recipe exactly first time and liked the flavour but not quite enough sauce for us. Next time, I doubled the sauce ingredients except I kept the original amount of oregano  and it was fabulous!

Like many other reviewers, I used chicken broth, white wine, lemon pepper, garlic salt and extra lemon juice, garlic and oregano.  I served it with buttered noodles and zucchini parmesan.  The flavors went really well together and it was an easy meal to put together.  Will definitely do it again.

We really didn't like this. It had no flavor and was dry. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used chicken tenderloins, instead of breast halves, because they were cheaper, and I forgot to add the parsley at the end. Served it with angel hair pasta with parmesan cheese, and steamed broccoli. I was going to thicken the sauce this makes to go over the noodles, but hated the flavor of it, so I cracked open a bottle of alfredo sauce. The only way we could eat this was to mix it in with the pasta. That said, I do think it has potential to be good.  Next time I make this, I will do the following: marinade the chicken for at least an hour in the juice of one lemon, olive oil, two cloves of garlic, garlic salt, lemon pepper, and oregano.  Then, I will either do the entire thing in the slow cooker, without browning the chicken first, or I will do the entire thing on the stove top. If I go with the slow cooker method, I will cook on low for no more than 4 hours. I will also use chicken broth, instead of water and bouillon, use lemon pepper instead of black pepper, and garlic salt instead of regular salt. I do think this particular recipe would be better done on the stove top because being able to scrape the brown bits into the sauce will help boost flavor, but both methods are unnecessary and results in dry chicken. Also, 6 hours for chicken is way, way too long. I never go more than 4. But I always follow the recipe the first time.

I doubled the seasonings adding 1 tsp. lemon peel or zest of one lemon and only 1/2 tsp. salt to the mixture  to coat the chicken, then browned.   I used 1 cup chicken broth instead of boullion and 1/4 cup lemon wine instead of water (deglazed the pan with the wine).  I also used a whole lemon. Juiced it then layered the chicken in the crockpot with onion, garlic, additional fresh oregano sprigs and the lemon remains cut in wedges making sure chicken is covered with broth.  Used chicken thighs and after 3 hours on low the chicken fell apart.  Thickened the gravy/sauce with cornstarch aND lemon juice.  Served it over mashed potatoes made with butter and sour cream.  Very tender, moist and deliciously lemony.  Husband says it would also be excellent served over egg noodles, rigatoni, any pasta or rice.  Plan to  to try with potatoes, onion, carrots, and a little fennel.

Excellent recipe. I halved my chicken breast as they were very thick. This recipe was delightful. I too doubled the liquid ingredients and am glad I did as it was just enough for 4 chicken breast (2 fat ones sliced in half) over Jasmine Rice. Fantastic recipe! I did not thicken the sauce and it was "loose" but very very tasty. A real keeper.

Basically same recipe, but modified to make it easier, removed salt.
Filet 2-3 Chicken Breasts into 2 pieces each.
Sprinkle to coat both sides with equal portions Lemon Pepper and Oregano.  Brown only lightly in butter.
In slow cooker MIX 1-2 cups low sodium chicken broth, 2 cloves chopped Garlic , 1 tsp Parsley, 3 TBsp lemon juice.  Arrange chicken in slow cooker so they are all submerged; add more broth if necessary.  Cook low 6-8 hrs, server over egg noodles or rice.  Broth can be thickened after for a more gravy like result.  YUMMM.

This is fantastic. My whole family loves it. I serve it with Bowie pasta or brown rice, and steamed broccoli.   It's on the weekly rotation!
Leftovers are great on a salad the next day.

Made this dish last night, served it over whole wheat spaghetti with parmesan. DELICIOUS! As did others, I added more water (about 1/2 cup) to the bouillon mixture. I also threw in some chopped onion which gave it more flavor. Very tasty & easy Sunday night dinner.

I added white wine and shallots after doubling the liquid recipe.  I used soup base instead of bullion, chic broth instead of water.   All suggestions by people who'd previously made this recipe.  It was very good.   I think I may make it with shrimp next time  BUT will add the shrimp at the end of the cooking process so they don't get tough.  Tasty and will make again.

I made this recipe for supper last night and it was delicious. First, I prepped the chicken individually with oregano and black pepper instead of mixing it all together. Next, I put the chicken in the crockpot, and added one can of chicken broth, lemon juice and granulated garlic. Once boiled, I added it to the crockpot, cooked it for 8 hours on low. I served it with egg noodles, green beans and a salad. My husband said it's a keeper. We have enough leftover to have again tonight. Tonight though, I'm making rice, yellow squash, and a salad.

Super easy, super tasty recipe!  I did the 6-hr low-heat crockpot method and it turned out great.  I served it over orzo (drizzled with a little olive oil) with microwave veggies on the side.  I will be making this again for sure!

Was really good.  Smelled great cooking.  My son came downstairs several times to see if it was ready.  :-)  It's a keeper.  Thank you!  Oh, I did saute with shallots and used chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes.

It was ok. Nothing great. I thickened the sauce a bit with corn starch at the end but I didn't get it thick enough. I followed other reviewers and doubled liquids. It had a lot of flavour . We just didn't weren't impressed with it.

I followed the recipe except I switched the lemon juice with lemon zest and also added 2 cups of water.
Also I cooked my chicken on low for 3 hours and it came out perfect and very juicy. Of course I halved all the breasts, some I even sliced in 3 instead of 2 because they were big. 
The package of chicken breast I got was 2.30 pounds.

I didn't  have fresh lemons in the house so I used lemon juice. Additionally, I used minced garlic from a jar because my garlic press recently broke. I can imagine this dish would be even more heavenly with the fresh ingredients. Here's what I did: once the chicken has been cooking in the crockpot for 45 minutes, I melted 4 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over medium heat, not allowing it to brown. Then add 2 1/2 cups of water, 3 more tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp of chicken bouillon and 2 tsp minced garlic and allow it to come to a boil. Remove from heat immediately and pour over the chicken in the crockpot. Be sure to make sure the chicken isn't sticking to the bottom and stir the liquid, being sure to scrape the bottom to incorporate the browning chicken. Twenty minutes before it was done cooking, I added the fresh parsley as directed. Before serving, I pulled the chicken apart a little bit, then served the chicken and its broth over my favorite Basmati Rice. Hope this helps.

absolutely FANTASTIC! I added a bit more garlic than what the recipe called for but my family is crazy for garlic. Also,  when the chicken was done cooking, I added some wondra and a half tsp butter to the leftover sauce/drippings to thicken it up just a bit. I then poured it over some egg noodles.  When my kids fight over leftovers,  you know it's good!

I have made this recipe twice now - I love the flavor.  The only thing is that I only cook it for an hour or so on high so that they chicken isn't dried out.  I also add a few twigs of thyme from my garden to it.

Like the video, I added 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp paprika to the rub.  And to the frying pan, 1/2 cup white wine, carrots and a few other chopped vegetables, replaced the water and chicken cube with 2 cups chicken broth.

This recipe would be five stars, with a few changes... mostly lemon zest. It makes it taste much more 'gourmet'! This is actually cooking right now in my crock pot! The first time around, & added lemon zest and white wine, along with more garlic & oregano, but used waaay too much lemon juice, so I added a bit of sugar to taste. I actually added 1 cup of water for more sauce, and some cornstarch to thicken it a bit. It turned out wonderfully, served over brown rice. (Although my husband still thought it was too tart.) Hopefully, this time it will turn out just as yummy... but a little less acidic! :)

This was so simple and everyone loved it.  The chicken just fell apart.  I used thicker chicken breasts so I added a little water and lemon to the slow cooker to add some more sauce.  You need to keep adding spices to the bowl as each piece of chicken took most of it each time.  totally worth it.  so much added flavor.

Super easy dish with alot of flavor. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is because its alot of oregano flavor for me, and I actually cut it in half and added rosemary. I did add more broth and lemon as others suggested. Thickened the juices for a great sauce over our roasted new potatoes. Will make this again!

Great slow cooker recipe! Used skinless chicken thighs and 1 can chicken broth. Deglazed pan with a bit of white wine after the browning of the thighs. Added sliced Portobello mushrooms as well. Before serving over angel hair pasta, reheated juices and thickened a bit with corn starch. Definitely do not overdo the lemon juice - 3 tablespoons is plenty. Final product had a "restaurant" feel to it. Yum!

Liked this recipe, but the cooking time is a bit much. It would be much better if cooked only for 4 hours on low. IF I was going to cook it on high, I would just stick it in the oven instead. Followed the recipe pretty well, though I did add some rosemary. It still didn't taste flavorful enough. the sauce after cornstarch was added to thicken it was good on pasta with diced tomato's. A decent meal overall, but not great.

The recipe calls for far too much butter and garlic and the cooking time is way off. I was only able to coat one side of the chicken breasts with the directed amounts of seasoning so I had to double it and the seasoning wound up fantastic. I cut an hour off of the cooking time, the chicken is by far the driest chicken that's come out of my kitchen.

Fearing that this Garlic Lemon Chicken would turn out bland as a review  indicated,I took another reviews recommendation and doubled the seasoning.  Also, I added potatoes, garlic and mushrooms at the bottom of the crock pot.
The outcome was 'promising' - the one complaint was of the overpowering flavor of oregano.  So, next time (and there will definitely be a next time)I will double the seasoning - except for the oregano.  
The execution was what I most appreciated - it's so easy.  With a little tweeking it will be great and I will add it to my go-to-recipe.

This was a great recipe. I did make a few changes. I browned the chicken in olive oil instead of butter. I also added mushrooms and artichokes. Great choice!! I loved the favors. I will make this again for sure. My husband loved it and he is really the cook in the family.

Very tasty and moist!! I added 1/2 cup of water and 1 can of chicken broth since I was going to be out most of the day and didn't want the dish to dry out. I served this with brown rice.

I added a little cornstarch to make the sauce a little thicker.. Mushrooms give it a different flavor and it turned out great. I added lemon pepper spice on top of everything else for the chicken and then some sugar. Tasted really good and will make again :)

So glad I decided to make this dish--it tasted fantastic! I used vegetable bouillon since I didn't have chicken bouillon. Dissolved it in 1 c. water AFTER I sauteed the garlic. I served the chicken with creamy mac-n-cheese and green beans for a delicious meal with my family. I will definitely make this one again!

People were complaining about it being bland. Instead of water use dry white wine. Add half an onion, chopped. Use seasoned salt instead of plain salt. Mix in a tablespoon of the chicken bouillon instead of just 1 tsp. If you like hot, add chili powder or cayenne pepper.

Great, simple recipe. I took suggestions of the reviews and doubled the sauce because I was serving it over pasta. I also used chicken broth rather than water and bouillon cube.  Also, I dont own anything to squeeze lemons so I bought 100% lemon juice at the store and used this. I also took the suggestion of the video and added garlic powder to the chicken rub. This recipe turned out GREAT! I loved the seasoning on the chicken.. I may have to continue using that. Some reviews so not to cook it first but honestly this is how the chicken becomes AMAZINGLY flavorful. We really enjoyed this meal.

I thought it was a real pain to have to brown the meat (mine was frozen so had to thaw it first). I wished I'd read the earlier review that skipping browning the meat and maybe it would have made a difference.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit! There were many moans and groans from the family while eating it, and they've all requested I make it often. I used my own chicken broth, and didn't have any parsley on hand, but other than that, I followed the recipe completely. I served it over rice, which was delicious. Try this recipe, you won't regret it!

This was delicious. I used the whole chicken including dark meat, seasoned with the salt and pepper, browned in a little butter and then deglazed the pan with the lemon juice, garlic and a bit of chicken broth. The rest of the chicken broth was added to the crock pot in place of the bullion cube and water. Made gravy with the sauce, serving with mashed potatoes and oven roasted asparagus .. Will make again

Pretty good.. I made this for my dad who can't eat salt and considering it is very low in salt (my version) it is great.  Lemon flavor really came thru.   Crock pot on high for 3 hours turned out great and not shredded.

The seasonings blend beautifully. I used a lot more liquid, as suggested by other reviewers. I would also recommend chicken thighs. I have made this twice and not cooked it nearly as long as the recipe states, but both times I've ended up with dry chicken.

SO easy, my husband rated it an 8-9 out of ten. Our sitter tried it & made it 2 weeks in a row. A keeper.

I was disappointed with this dish.  I followed the instructions on the video since I've found that the videos often incorporate common revisions stated by many.  The finished product was still quite bland even with an added teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and paprika (all recommended).  The paprika gave the dish some kick but it still lacked flavor.  Also, I didn't care for the falling-apart texture of the chicken.  I'll be removing this recipe from my box.  Sorry.

I have made this twice, but neither times with bouillon, use chicken broth instead of it and the water for a more natural, less salty dish. My husband and son both liked it, yeah! I make it with basmati rice and asparagus.  And it's so easy as it's slow cooked and tender juicy ready to eat in the evening.

I only did about a lb of chicken so I halved the spices, butter, lemon & garlic, but I took the advice from the other reviewers and added more liquids.  I did about 3/4 cup chicken bouillon & 1/4 cup of white wine.  The sauce was the best part of the whole meal!!  Served it over angel hair pasta.

I made this and it was super tender! I served it with quinoa and my friends all loved it.  But next time I make it I am definitely going to increase the seasonings, because I started running low by the time I was putting it on some of the last chicken breasts.

I am a huge fan of crock pot meals having two little ones that don't always allow me to stand over the stove and make a decent meal and this recipe is a family favorite out of all my crock pot meals! I use chicken stock instead of the cube but it comes out delicious and can go with so many different sides!  Thanks for sharing!

Very dry & very bland. We threw it on egg noodles and that didn't help. As for the leftovers, I strained the juice, pulled all the chicken apart (like pulled pork), doused it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to give it some flavor. Then we put it on hamburger buns. That's what I should have done in the first place!

What a great recipe. Instead of using chicken breasts, I used chicken legs, and it turned out fantastic. As my family, loves garlic, I browned the chicken in the skillet with butter, garlic and onions. I then chopped up more garlic and put into the crockpot raw with the chicken. I excluded the parsley.

I didn't have time to make this in the slow cooker so I ended up baking it in a 9x13 glass dish. Still came out tender and delicious. I added more garlic and used chicken broth instead of the chicken granules. Paired this with a steamed veggie mix and there were no left overs!

It was very good and will make it again bu with a few alterations. I did add more chicken broth, which is what I used in place of the water and bouillon. I would add more garlic and a little more lemon juice and also onion, which wasn't part of the recipe. Finally I would take some broth out at the end and add some cornstarch to make a thicker gravy type sauce.

I had high hopes for this dish; the chicken looked so good, and was falling apart like fish when we removed it from the slow cooker.  Upon eating, however, it was dry, and we ended up dipping it in salad dressing just to choke it down!  We did the full six hours on low - maybe the texture would be different if you do it on High instead?

I used 1/2 c water, 1 cube bouillon, 20 oz chicken, 2 tbs butter, 3 tbs lemon juice.  I sauteed it on the stove.  Lots of flavor and it only took about 10 minutes to make!

This turned out great and I didn't change a thing.  It's the first dish I've made in my slow cooker that my kids like.  Will make this again for sure.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and it was perfect.

My husband constantly asks me to make this chicken!  Very easy and super flavorful!  I always cook it on low for the full 6 hours, and the torture of smelling it in the slow cooker all day is totally worth it!

Delicious! Chicken came out tender and moist. I did take the advice of a previous review and mixed 2T. of cornstarch with a 1/4c water to make liquid into a gravy. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. I will defintely make again.

I did not have time to brown this so I threw everything (except butter) in the crockpot.  I added onions and mushrooms.  I added extra garlic cloves, oregano, and some white wine.  I used enough chicken stock to cover the chicken.  Cooked my frozen chicken breasts on low for about 4 hours.  I also thickened the sauce at the end on the stove to make a gravy mix with cornstarch.  Despite these changes, the chicken was still dry and bland.  The sauce was okay.  I do not foresee myself making this again.

This chicken came out beautifully. I was a bit concerned with one of the reviewers only giving it 1 star. However, I noticed that they slow-cooked the chicken on 'HIGH for 8 HOURS' instead of on LOW. Maybe that was the reason why it was so dry.
I did the 6 hours on Low and it was absolutely tender and is great to have on my salad.

I love this Recipe! I have made this three times in the past month! I do add a little more lemon since I love a strong lemony taste so I add the juice of three lemons and a little more garlic. I don't bother browning just throw it all in the crockpot.  I also cook on low for about four hours and it comes out super moist and tasty!  Thanks for the awesome and easy recipe!

I loved this recipe! The key is to cook on low or medium. The meat is incredibly moist and falls apart. I did take suggestions from others, just for my own likes, such as more garlic, no salt added because I used chicken broth.  It's great over rice, and if you pull some of the chicken out of the broth it makes yummy chicken sandwiches the next day!  Definitely a keeper!

Very yummy.  Doubled everything.  Ended up adding about two cups of the water from the pasta I was making, just to have more sauce.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried.  Fresh would have been much better though.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was just okay. Three hours was way too long and made the outside of the chicken dry and tough. I should have know better than try to cook chicken that long in a crock pot! As others suggested, I used more spices but only 3 Tbs of lemon juice. I used chicken broth in place of water for more flavor. That didn't help much. I won't make this again.

First experience with a slow cooker and everybody in my family liked it. I added more lemon juice, sprinkled flour on the chicken and in the end I tickened the sauce with Tapioca starch. I followed my slow cooker instruction for the time, 4 hours on slow for chicken breast, but it was done in 3 hours.

oh...my...goodness!  When I turned this off at 11 p.m., I made the mistake of tasting it.  I wanted to sit down and eat the entire pot.  It is absolutely delicious (and I can't cook)!

I made this for my family and it was just okay. Followed many of the comments for improvement. The sauce was too thin and was actually nothing great. Was disappointed it didn't have more flavor. Sorry, not a winner for us.

Followed directions and used 4lbs of chicken. Was good but dry for some reason. I think I might have cooked it too long but it was good never the less. Will make this one again and try to get it moister. The flavor was good but was not as lemony as I expected. Was subtle which was ok.

This is the first time I have cooked something besides Chili in the cockpot and wow was it easy. I cooked it for my mothers Birthday and she loved it along with everyone else. I also added more water like everyone had said to in the previous posts and the chicken turned out super moist!

I used fresh boneless, skinless chicken breast and it was ready in 3 hours. Not a second longer! I shred it with my fork over brown rice and poured some of the juice over everything. Delicious

Wow! delicious, succulent, flavorful. I used one large chicken breast cut in half, and then halved all of the ingredients. I didn't modify their proportions, just exactly half of everything. I cooked it in my VERY small crock pot for about 3 hours. Fabulous!

I'm not a fan of my own cooking, but I have to say, this was delicious. I had 5 chicken breasts on the small side, so I cooked on low for just under 3 hours.  Followed the recipe for the most part (exceptions: since I did not have oregano, I used thyme.  I used 2 chicken boulion cubes and after the mixture was poured on the chicken, I added one can of College Inn broth to cover the chicken.  When I removed the chicken 3 hours later, I added a small mixture of heavy cream and cornstarch to the sauce.) Served over mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make again. Thank you.

My family raved about this meal. In fact, my daughter just called from the grocery asking for the list of ingredients.  I thickened the liquid with corn starch about 15 mins. before serving, and served it over buttered noodles.

This was SO good. Even my husband like it who is such a picky eater. I did add 1/4 water, 2 more cloves are garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of McCormick chicken seasoning. ( I had over 2 pounds of chicken) Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! The whole family loved it. Instead of water and bouillon, I used about 2 cups of homemade chicken stock. There was plenty of juice to cover a pound of angel hair pasta with extra to add to each plate. Also added a few extra garlic cloves. Will make this again and again.

I didn't taste much of the lemon, garlic or spice, but LOTS of salt. Too much for me. It was tender and moist, but nothing very special about it otherwise.

I didn't have a crockpot handy, so I sliced the boneless breasts lengthwise into 1/2" pieces so they would cook up faster and be more tender then a whole breast can be when just cooked on the stove top.  Definitely follow the advice about increasing the liquids. What did everyone serve this with? Sauteed spinach would be good...

Did not understand cooking it before putting it in the slow cooker. I took someone elses advice and only put it in the crockpot for 3 hrs on low - and mine was still rubbery. Not much taste. Husband did not complain (though he never does). Served with green bean bake and mashed potatoes (both of which were super good).

this was DELICIOUS...my family loved it! i eye balled the seasonings cause i feel this didn't make enough for my taste...i also added mrs. dash garlic & herb blend and instead of regular salt, i used garlic. oh, i did use like 1/3 cup of lemon juice...again for my taste. and i think the browning of the chicken is what makes those spices stick making it super flavorful! i served this over garlic-butter rice and WOW :)

I followed the basic recipe adding cooking wine, onions, paprika, seasoning salt and a T of grapefruit habanero pepper sauce to it (try Marie Sharp's  - it's perfection), which gave it that lemony yet tangy kick.  Fabulous!  Cooked 3.5 hours on high after browning chix in olive oil (added a splash of garlic infused olive oil for additional flavor).

This was very good and simple. I used whole chicken legs instead because I thought the breasts would be too dry. I marinated them overnight with olive oil, garlic, montreal chicken seasoning and lemon. And I tripled the seasonings. Also, make sure the chicken is covered in liquid so it doesn't dry out.

I tried this recipe last night.  It smelled so good all day.  The chicken was juicy, however it's the sauce we had a problem with.  For our taste, too much lemon and garlic.  The spices were good so next time I will go very easy with lemon and garlic.

Delicious and easy to make, but somewhat non-descript. It can be a staple chicken in your home for a quick, easy, typical dinner, but not necessarily a unique chicken dish.

followed idea of dredging in lemon pepper but it was too peppery and 6 hours in crock pot seemed to take away all flavors but pepper. Added carrots and broccoli to top of chicken which tasted good. I would dredge in oregano only

The chicken is very soft and delicious. We put about half the recommended servings for the lemon because the first time it was way overpowering. We all love this recipe.

This was really, really good.  Everyone in my family LOVED it!!  This is an AWESOME recipe!!!!!! It was fall-off-the-bone tender.  I would SO recommend it for YOUR dinner.  So good for when you are not around to cook for our family!  I had to be somewhere, and I had it ready so when they came home from football, it was nice and warm.

Good recipe, I will definitely save in my recipe box. I used season salt and garlic pepper to season meat. I used a lime instead of lemon.I omitted the frying just put in crock pot with juices and cook for 3 hours.

This was awesome! Super SUPER tangy! I did make a few changes: I used Pam to cook the chicken instead of butter (trying to eat healthier!) I used Lemon & Pepper seasoning on the chicken and added one cup of water! I know that this is a Slow Cooker recipe but as my sister-in-law has my slow cooker I actually just made it in a pan on the stove for an hour on low! Turned out great, Chicken was tender and the gravy was very tastey! Thank you so much for this recipe, my Boyfriend loved it and made "Mmmmm" noises throughout the meal! Ha! Cheers!

Loved this recipe! I over cooked it but the flavor was still wonderful! I added extra seasonings including Mrs. Dash's lemon chicken seasoning and it was great! I used 4 cups of water mixed with 2 packets of Goya chicken bouillon. I will add this to my rotation of dinner recipes!

This was pretty good for a quick throw together recipe.  I only had frozen chicken so I put that in the crock and then boiled the 1 cup water with the other ingredients and poured over the top.  After 4 hours the chicken was falling apart.  To give it color and flavor after adding the parsley I pan fried in a little olive oil.  My Italian friend makes lemon chicken with basil and fresh mint so I think I will try that next time instead of oregano.

Not great.  Chicken was sort of dry.  The flavoring didn't really penetrate the chicken like you expect from a slow cooker recipe.  Will not make this one again.

This chicken was fantastic--a great way to get that baked chicken flavor without turning on the oven! I used thighs and legs (it was what I had on hand), and they were so tender they were falling apart! I had to adjust the cook time: 2 hrs on high, 2 hrs on low. This chicken will definitely make many more appearances on my table.

I didn't brown the chicken first, just put all ingredients in crockpot.  I followed other's suggestions and added a bit more liquid, used broth instead of bouillon & water, more garlic, and I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I cooked on low for almost 8 hours, so the chicken fell of the bones and served well over linguine. This recipe smelled heavenly cooking, but tasted just pretty good.   I would cook for less time next time - maybe that'll improve flavor?  This was super-easy!

This was so good!  I cut the chicken into strips, so that they would absorb more of the flavour.  I also added extra liquid, but not as much as some of the other reviewers recommended, and it was fine.  My husband loved it and was sad when it was all gone!

Delish!  For those who thought the chicken was dry, try cooking for less time but--even better--use chicken thighs as they are more moist than boneless breasts.  I omitted salt and used fat-free chicken broth and also added some mushrooms toward the end.
A keeper!

I took the advice of other people and substituted the water for chicken stock. It worked great! The taste was tangy and delicious. We had garlic/broccoli couscous and Caesar salad with it, and a nice Red Truck Pinot! This was my first attempt at cooking chicken in a slow cooker, and it was delightful!

I would give this recipe 3 stars, but my husband said 5 so I compromised with 4.  He absolutelly loved it. I thought it was good, but it was really, really tangy.  I thought the lemon juice was a bit overpowering.  I will definitly have to cook it again since my husband thought it was so fantastic, but I think I will play with it a little next time.

Followed suggestions of doubling liquid. Great idea as this sauce is wow! Also cooked on low, this helps keep the chicken moist. Another tip for slow cooking is not to open the cover too much during cooking as the steam, moisture inside will come out. This is what cooks and keeps meats moist in a slow cooker. This is not a dish that adapts well to all-day cooking but I think it is a great last minute idea (3-4 hours on LOW is perfect). Thanks!

I followed this recipe the entire way yet was disappointed in the results.  Although I took other reviewers suggestions to add more liquid to the recipe (I doubled it), my chicken was still much too dry and it was in the slow cooker for less than two hours.

I thought this recipe was good, but the chicken ended up being a lil drier than I would have liked, so maybe a lil less time in the cooker or more liquid to cover it.  Overall I thought the flavor was pretty tasty.

Good. More work than it's worth though. Seems like you would get the same results in a skillet much quicker! Won't use this method again.

I loved the Lemon Garlic sauce, and this was an easy recipe. I used chicken leg quarters instead of the breasts and it worked just great. I served the sauce over some corn bread stuffing too.

read the reviews, used no sodium chicken broth, no sodium granules, eliminated the salt and pepper and used lemon pepper and per previous reviews added white wine.  I think it was done a little to much as  chicken was stirngy and a little dry.  but otherwise very good.  my husband loved it saie it was the best checken yet.

This was a really easy recipe, great for putting in the crock pot and forgetting about it.  3 hours on high was perfect. I did double the sauce although it didn't cover the chicken but it came out tender. Great with rice and garden fresh purple hull peas.

Good recipe--comes out so tender for such a short time (for a slow cooker). Skipped browning, used tenders. Used other users comments by using more water (used 1 cup). Next time will use 2 cups--a little too much lemon for me. Layered with onions on the bottom like recommended. Yum!

We'll definitely make this again. It's so simple and very tasty! The meat was extremely tender and juicy.  I used lemon pepper and white wine (Pinot Grigio) as others have. I too had to add more liquid than the recipe called for; just put in more water, lemon juice, & wine from the start.

Love this recipe and it's now a staple in my home. I like to use lots of oregano and slightly brown in a pan first. Sometimes I double the sauce part for lots of flavor. I always serve with rice - delish!

I thought this recipe was alright. I followed some of the other reviewers' directions and it still turned out dry. It also needed a little more flavor, or something to kick it up a bit. Maybe if I try making it again, I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces.

I make a recipe identical to this only with a few of my own modifications. I use more water and I also put slices of butter on top of my chicken while it cooking. I also prefer chicken thighs to breasts. They turn out more moist and flavorful. This a wonderful dish and a favorite in our house! :)

I made this with frozen chicken tenders instead and added some frozen whole green beans near the end of cooking time.  Pretty good, will probably make this one again.

Very easy, used white wine instead of water.  Cooked in 4 hours, 6 would have been much too long.  Sliced the chicken placed over noodles and poured the gravy on top. Family approved meal.

This was good, but 6 hours is way too long. I also would not take the advice of others and put the lemon slices in with the chicken unless you really love lemon. I wil probably make again because it was so easy and smelled great cooking.

This recipe was very full of flavor.  I did change a few things.  I used italian dressing instead of lemon juice and used two chicken bouillon cubes with two cups of water instead of the granules to make more sauce.  This recipe would be really good served with or over rice

I thought this recipe was good. I did do what one person did and that was to add the juice of a whole lemon and then add the lemon to the pot to cook w/ the chicken and also season the chicken w/ lemon chicken season. Also for my side dish i added fresh green beans and 1 onion to pot to cook w/ it. Add rice for a side has well and the dish was good, moist and not to over powered with lemon flavor. Will make agian.

I don't know what to say about this.  I had to tweak it so much that I can't give it a true rating.  All I can really say is that the sauce definitely needs to the thickened.

This was simple to make and came out pretty good.

I made some changes of using juice of a whole lemon and then threw the skins in the slow cooker to give even more of a lemon flavour, used a bit more pepper and added some sliced mushrooms.

In future I won't bother to use salt when seasoning the chicken as I did find this dish a little bit salty for my liking.

Not a favourite recipe but will make again as it provides a nice change to our usual chicken dishes.

I really liked this one!! I did add a lot to it though - the chicken was very tender unlike other comments on here BUT i did add 2 cups of water (w/one boullion cube), extra garlic and about 1 hour before completion - I shredded the chicken, added mushrooms & spinach, a little corn starch to thicken it just a bit, and then threw the whole thing over rigatoni . . . it was good!

I had this at a friend's house last night and enjoyed it.  I agree that it's a little dry, that's why it only gets 4 stars, but I loved the flavor.  I'm going to make it for myself next time.

I only wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars.  This became a fast favorite among family and friends.  I make it several times a month and leftovers don't usually last long enough to become a meal the next day.

I've made this recipe three times and never completely satisfied with the outcome.  I don't know if it's the slow cooking of a basically tender meat or the acid of the lemon juice.  But whether I used bone-in or boneless chicken breast the result was the same: leather-dry chicken.

wow, was this good! chicken was moist and flavorful. Followed other recommendations and doubled up the sauce to cover the chicken in the crockpot. Also, substituted chicken broth for the water. cooked on high for three hours and it was ready to go! Will definitely make again!

The actual recipe is pretty bland.  I prepared using White wine, extra bouillon and covering chicken entirely in broth per other reviews.  I have no idea how you can use a slow cooker with only 1/4 cup of liquid. 
I cooked for six hours in my crock pot.  Broth was flavorful, but i guess i'm not a white meat chicken person. It was falling apart but not tender.  Kind of stringy dry.  Oh, and i added mushrooms.  I might try again with thigh meat.

I did not care for this dish very much, and neither did the rest of my family.  My husband, who is usually very easy to please with meals, did not like it at all because it tasted very bland.  I took the tips from others and added chicken broth, and also added some extra garlic...but it just didnt do much.  The chicken was very juicy and moist, but just very very unflavorful.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I have to give this a 5 star, the chicken was so tender and worth the wait. I cooked it on low for about 4 hours and it was done. I also added chicken broth to the slow cooker and made sure that all the chicken was covered. A few people were saying that it was dry because not enough juice. I have to say, you must add chicken broth. I also doubled up the rub and I served it with mashed potatoes and put the extra juice over the potatoes. This is a excellent chicken dish. Quick to assemble, easy, but the wait. Well that is what a slow cooker is for. :)

This recipe is amazing. Very quick to prepare, but is best cooked on the low setting so it doesn't dry out. I found also that the spice mixture does need to be doubled to be enough.

Also, instead of breasts, this is made REALLY nicely with legs too. Serves up well with a nice garlic alfredo pasta.

Tasted fine, but I think the cook time is too long. I did it on high for 3 hours and although it was fall-apart tender, it tasted kind of dry, especially the leftovers. Will try again.

One of the best lemon chicken recipes that I've tried. I did change a couple of things, like adding a 2 tablespoons of olive oil while browning the chicken, it browned more evenly and added great flavor.Also, I used a half cup of chicken broth instead of the water.

I checked the chicken after 1 hour cooking on HIGH in my slow cooker, and it was DRY.  The recipe says to cook it for 3 hours, so I don't know what that would have done.  I only used 2 pieces of chicken (1.5 lbs), so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it.  Will not make this again.

This was the second time I've tried this recipe, both times it has come out FANTASTIC. 

The first time was in the crockpot....took a bit longer to cook than the recipe said, maybe an extra hour or so, and I didn't think there was enough liquid (although what there was, was delicious, just not enough for the rice I served with it!)

This time I only doubled the water and chicken boullion (1/2 cup water & 2 tsp boullion) and one extra tbsp of lemon juice (all I had left).  I started it too late in the day for the slowcooker, so I did everything the same, except after browning the chicken and adding the liquid, I then placed it all in a baking pan, covered it tightly in foil, then baked it for an hour at 350.  It came out wonderfully moist and very tasty.

This is a permanent 'regular' for our family...my husband and all the kids (4 of them ranging from 2 to 12) ALL cleaned their plates!

This was pretty good but I didn't cook for the full time...about 30 min short and it was a bit dry. I suggest shortening the time but other than that it was great! Kids loved it for sure!

This turned out really good! I enjoyed the flavor and it came out moist, I was worried it would be dry. I made no changes really, only I did forget to put in the bouillon granules & Parsley, but I did not realize that until just now, LOL! I am putting the leftovers in my salad for lunch tomorrow, very yummy! I served with Garlic Cous Cous and corn on the cob. Will make again and will pass on.

This recipe is awesome!  Like many others, I doubled the sauce and made it into a gravy.  I also added sliced mushrooms and potatoes along with the fresh parsley and served it with sugar snap peas and the whole family loved it!

I was a little skeptical of this one and held off on making it for a while, but I felt brave one day and decided to go for it.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  I didn't do anything differently.. just followed the recipe as written.  My husband said it smelled (and tasted!) delicious.

I was disappointed with this one.  From the reviews I read and considering the ingredients, I really thought this was going to be a winner.  The chicken was dry (cooked on high for 2 hours) and the sauce was kind of boring.  Sorry!

Very good! I tried it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was too dry for me. I use boneless chicken thighs instead. Smells and tastes great. Easy and simple to prepare. I make it quite often.

Easy and delicious.  I used chicken broth as others had recommended. I served this with lemon-pepper pasta.  We like alot of lemon so I added a bit of lemon zest to the dish before serving.

I thought this was just awful. The cooking times and directions were way off. The chicken was as dry as can be. My wife and I probably ate a half breast between us and threw the other three and a half breasts away. Thankfully, the company were to have over cancelled at the last minute saving me some embarrassment.

Should be called oregano and black pepper chicken, because that’s all I tasted. I inadvertently put in more lemon juice than was called for and it didn’t taste like lemon at all.

With all the spices you would think the chicken would have a good flavor.
The only flavor was in the juice it produced .  This one is not a keeper!

I made this as per the video but used chicken thighs, and instead of peas I used butter beans.
I cooked on low for the full 6 hrs and the chicken was tender and moist.
I made gravy with the juices and served with brown rice, beets and cauliflower.
It was delicious and I will do it again, maybe adding some soy sauce to give it a boost, but that might be overkill.

So good! After it was cooked, I poured the juices into a pan and made a bit more based off original amount and added some cornstarch to make a thicker top. I then put some capers on top when serving! Delish??

Delicious and easy! I quickly made this before stepping out to an appt. When I got back, dinner was done! All I did was make a side of brown rice. I put the chicken on top and drizzled some of the juice over the chicken. I will definitely be making this again. I did add a pinch of chili powder to the oregano, salt, and pepper, but that is the only minor change I made to the recipe.

This is amazingly flavorful and easy. I was slightly concerned the chicken would be dry but it was moist and fall apart delicious. My husband said it was the best chicken dish ever ! I served it with steamed carrots and pearled couscous. A definite repeat ! And or those on WW - it is only 2 points:)

I took the advice from the accompanying video and increased the spices on the chicken.  Didn't really make a lot of difference after the chicken had been in the sauce for all that time.  The chicken was pretty tasteless.  I removed the mushrooms and the chicken from the slow cooker, transferred the liquid to a saute pan and reduced by 1/3.  I adjusted for salt and added garlic salt as well.  Originally, it was t was very lemony, but the garlic was virtually non-existent.  The garlic salt in the end made all the difference, as well as the corn starch to thicken the sauce to a more gravy-like consistency.  I wish I had made mashed-potatoes.  The gravy, in the end, was AMAZING.  I encourage everyone to shred the chicken, in order to take as much gravy as possible per bite.  YUMMY!!!

Definitely add more liquid. Flavor was good but, chicken was dry. I did a fast slow cook. 3 1/2 hours. Served over angel hair pasta. I did add capers to the final serve for a little zip !

This receipe sounded really good so I made it for dinner tonight.  I followed the receipe as written, however the chicken did not have any flavor.  Very disappointed!  Will not make it agsin.

Delicious, as is, but the hubster doesn’t care for the lemon flavor.  I’ll try it again with less or no lemon. Served with Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe Recipe

Loved it.  So easy and so delicious.  I used white wine and dried poultry seasoning with a splash of white pepper.  This will be a do over. Thanks

I mean, it's a good receipe, but nothing I would make to impress someone. I added Ms Dash seasoning on the chicken, added chicken broth and some cooking wine. Also added carrots, onion and mushrooms. Chicken was moist. Next time I am going heavy on all the seasonings and it will be right up my alley.

First time I made exactly per recipe, served over zoodles. It was absolutely delicious! Next time I thought I would save a few calories and didn't brown first. Mistake! Third time did same as first and will always do it that way! There is just enough juice, thickening adds unwanted calories and not necessary. My husband LOVES this recipe and so do I!

I just made this and it was great! I took the advice of others and added about 1.5 cups of chicken broth and a about 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I didn’t have to cook it for 3 whole hours. Probably around 2.5. Served with mashed potatoes and veggies, so I added some corn starch to the liquids to thicken it up a bit.

I made it following the numerous suggestion to increase the liquid. My family likes onion so I sautéed onion with the garlic. In the end I made gravy with the sauce (also suggested in previous reviews) and served it over spaghetti noodles. It was fabulous!

Wonderful! Followed some flavor enhancing advice from others - like more liquid and I used chicken broth. Wasn’t sure if my husband would like the flavor but after a few bites he said, “when are you making this again?” So easy.

Horrible.  I browned 3 thick skinless breasts in butter. Put in crock pot. Covered with stock and about 3T lemon juice and 4 cloves chopped garlic.  Cooked on low for 6 hours. Smelled great. Tasted gross. Chicken was dry and tasteless.

If I make it again I will definitely add more seasonings.  I was really expecting some lemon and garlic flavors to come through , but they didn't.  Came out pretty tasteless until we added lemon pepper and garlic powder at the table.

Excellent recipe. Browning the breasts first is key and I doubled the seasoning so both sides were well covered. After six hours on slow cook I had some tender chicken for sure. It divided into four moderate portions served with buttered noodles and there was just enough rich sauce to flavor it all. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

For me this was just not good.  Boneless skinless chicken breast is unfortunately one of the most boring ingredients ever..I was hoping slow cooking it would keep it moist and tender but it is still pretty dry and the sauce is lacking in any kind of special flavor.  Just not a fan.   One star for sure.

Fabulous recipe!  Halved the chicken. Added more oregano and pepper in rub and  tripled plus the garlic , but probably not needed if you don’t like strong flavors.  Also made it again and cooked in the oven covered for 2hours on 325 and it came out just as delicious ??  excellent recipe, easy, even the kids asked what I was making because they said the house smelled sooo amazing! Will make again and again

This was fantastic!!  It is difficult to manage meals while working night shifts. My girls and husband LOVE this meal!  I didn’t do the parsley because I was asleep, but it was super flavorful. My only recommendation would be to make additional sauce.  This will be made again very soon!!

This was an easy recipe to prepare.  After reading other reviews, I kept the sauce ingredients the same, but halved the chicken & rub. I added shallots and wine and a little extra lemon juice. I also used 1 boullion cube dissolved in a cup of water.  Once the chicken was ready, I added cornstarch dissolved in about 1/4 cup of heavy cream. Served over thin spaghetti with a side of snow peas. Pretty good dinner!

This was fantastic.  I used chicken broth instead of water as well.  I also liked the addition of a bit of white wine.  Scrumptious.  Easy to make.  Definitely a keeper.  But hubby didn't like it with pasta.  Need to make it next time with either rice or mashed potatoes for him.  But he isn't a pasta fan.

I forgot the parsley, and used two bullion cubes since I didn't have granules. I made sauce from the liquid by adding about 1/2 cup water and 2 rounded tablespoons rice flour slurry. This will become one of my regulars. Loved it!

This recipe  only called for a quarter cup liquid in a crock pot cooking for six hours. That makes absolutely no sense. Also it calls for browning the chicken before putting it in the crock pot which cooks it most of the way through. Everything was burned and the meat hard as a rock. Completely inedible. It smelled like it would have tasted great if it was cooked properly. I should have followed my instincts instead of the ridiculous recipe.

REALLY good!! I did like some of the other reviews & added wine and chicken broth instead of water.  Also used lemon pepper before the oregano, a little extra lemon juice and garlic. The sauce is ridiculously amazing!! Going to shred the left overs for wraps or tacos tomorrow!

Nice and simple, and tasty. I only added a tiny bit more water and it came out fine. I might use a tad bit less lemon juice, and there's no such thing as too much garlic, but this made for a nice slow-cooker meal the whole family enjoyed.

Delicious. I followed other suggestions and used chicken broth and white wine instead of water. I tripled the garlic and added a little rosemary. Finally, I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. My family really liked it.

The tiny amount of water in this recipe scared me!  I used a cup of water and half a cup of white wine. I also added paprika to the dry rub and onion to the pan with the garlic. Six hours on low the chicken just fell apart!

This was so easy and delicious!   I also added 2 cups of water and 2 bullion cubes as per another review, and a more generous amount of lemon juice.  Additionally when finished, I made a roux (melted butter w/ flour) and added liquid from the crock pot until Sauce reached my desired thickness and served over pasta!  So delish !!!  Big Bang for very little effort.

An easy but reliable chicken recipe. I followed the recipe nearly exact for two large chicken breasts and they turned out very moist and were done in a little under three hours. I didn’t have any chicken bouillon cubes so I subbed chicken broth. Next time I’ll use the both as it probably adds even more flavor.  Served over whole wheat noodles and poured some of the juice from the crockpot for sauce. Definitely will use again and wouldn’t be afraid to try out some modifications.

My husband & I ate this on top of linguine, which was pretty tasty, but next time we'll try it with Soba noodles because we think that will taste even better. In addition to adding 1/2 cup more of water + another 1 tsp of chicken bouillon, I also included sliced carrots and onion in the crock pot. The lemon flavor was strong but not overwhelming. We enjoyed this meal. :)

Cooked on low for 4 hours and chicken was very dry, but falling apart.  Had good flavor, but I would have added more lemon if I had more.   Only major changes were adding sliced mushrooms, doubling the sauce and thickening it with a cornstarch slurry the last few min.  May make the sauce part again and just serve over pan seared chicken.

Smells so wonderful while cooking.  Has a great flavor.  I cooked pretty thick pieces of chicken breasts.  It wasn't dry, but it wasn't as moist as I had hoped it might be. Next time I will cook thinner pieces.

I made the recipe as instructed with the only change of adding chicken broth to the crock pot as I was afraid the chicken would dry out too much without it.  The chicken breasts seemed a little tough after 6 hours, not sure if it was because they were so thick or if 6 hours was too long to cook.  I did shred it with 2 forks and allow it to soak overnight in the broth which helped a bit for the next day.  It was edible but overall I didn't find that it had enough flavor to want to make it again.

I made the chicken as it, but used 1/2 cup water for the bouillon, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1/3 cup white wine. Cooked on slow for 6 hours, and took the chicken out and added some flour to the sauce to thicken. Served over egg noodles and topped with feta cheese. Was SO good!

I followed this recipe as written but was concerned it might over cook so I checked it at 2 hrs and 30 min. It was done. With the sauce ( which was the best part) it was eatable but still over cooked. I usually read the reviews before making it but had printed it off 6 years ago! Oh well, live and learn.

Easy, tasty but not very flavorful and not enough sauce. I would recommend doubling the water, lemon etc to make more sauce. Still very good chicken.

The video ingredients and the written ingredients are similar but for it to be really good, one needs to follow the video directions. First time I made this according to the written ingredients, then I went back and watched the video and added the rest of the spices, and the extra liquids. What a difference!

Really great base recipe. I cut the chicken into smaller parts to get extra searing and add more of the seasonings and garlic. I also add extra water like others recommend. The leftover liquid could be made into a gravy.
This chicken goes GREAT on Uncle Ben's wild rice.

Added red potatoes, baby carrots, garlic and fresh green beans. It was amazing! Chicken was flavorful and fell apart easily.

Made this as our first slow cooker recipe. We doubled the sauce and rub ingredients and didn't put in any parsley. Ours only took 2 hours to cook but it looked, smelled, and tasted amazing. Definitely a favorite!

Great flavor and very juicy. I sauteed some zucchini for the side and have a pretty clean little meal. Followed the directions almost exactly except for maybe a little extra garlic and half lemon half lime juice since I ran out... (forgot to read reviews!! So relieved it was good)

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and it was perfect! The chicken was tender and moist; didn't need to modify the amount of liquid at all.

This was delicious, we loved it. We added extra chicken bouillon and water just barely covering the chicken, which came out juicy and tender, easily falling apart.

This a great flavor... My family loved it... In stead of  the slow cooker crock pot I used my pressure cooker... I set the cook time for 38 minutes, I cooked 5 pounds of chicken...it fell apart and almost melted in your mouth...My grandmother from Italy would have been proud...

We loved this recipe at our house and will definitely make it again.  I followed many of the other reviewers and used:  3 cloves minced garlic, 1 small shallot minced, 1 cup chicken stock, 1/2 - 3/4 tbsp Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base instead of the crystals (seems to have less sodium), 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1/4 c white wine- and used this mixture to deglaze the pan after browning the chicken.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts which definitely allowed more of the seasoning to seep into the meat during the slow cooking process.  In addition to the above  ingredients, I also used approximately 1/2 - 3/4 tsp white pepper to add a little kick.  Cooked on high for the first hour, and then 3 hours on low.  When I had 30 minutes left, I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch and thickened the liquid.  I did add some extra chicken stock to make sure the meat was fully submersed in the liquid during cooking.  Served with mashed potatoes and spinach- delightful!

So the sauté before the crockpot was a bit of a turn off, but I did it.  It was quick & made the chicken look so much more appetizing.  I used Ellisse's review for  hints. Didn't have the parsley just used herbs I had. I think it went closer to 2.5 or 3 hours in the crockpot on med high & was completely done if not slightly over done. Left overs with mayo & tomato so good for sandwiches.

This is a quick easy recipe. I didn't have just plain oregano so used 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I keep chicken broth in my fridge/freezer most all of the time. So I used broth instead of water/boullion. I think the post adding wine might be tasty too.

It's a thumbs up from the entire family! Used chicken broth instead of boullion since I had it on hand.  Added capers at the end and served on thin spaghetti. I will double the sauce next time.  Easy to make and really awesome to eat!

It was horrible! The broth tasted like nothing but oregano. I'm gonna try and salvage the chicken. No lemon flavor at all. I tasted nothing but oregano & pepper.

Awesome recipe. However, as usual I put my spin on it with limited resources & counter space. If you like, you can prepare the chicken breasts (also works with pork chops) remove some of the fat & you can thin the breasts (optional) for faster cooking. Put some Olive oil in pan with minced garlic & sliced onion until garlic starts to brown. Season chicken with seasoned salt & lemon pepper & place in pan add lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of beer & cook over medium heat until chicken is done. The fluids will be absorbed & evaporate allowing a sear if desired. Keep a close eye on chicken breasts, they have a tendency to be a little dry if over cooked. Note: You can use the lemon juice, garlic, seasoned salt, lemon pepper, onion & beer as a marinade which will leave you with the option to cook inside or BBQ. Hope this works for you.

I watched the video and it was different than the recipe
and followed those instructions  but thought it could have more flavor.

Very good moist chicken.  I did double the sauce recipe and because I love lemon I added zest of one lemon also and used chicken broth/wine instead of water.

I used thighs instead of breasts. It was good, the meat very tender and fell off the bone. Not overly fabulous, and probably won't make it again, so I'm giving it an average rating.

The flavor of the chicken was quite good.   I would recommend this dish.  I wish there was a better way to keep chicken from drying out in the crockpot.  Add more liquid to the recipe.

This came out so much better than anticipated! I followed a previous poster and deglazed the pan with white onion (what I had at home already), fresh minced garlic, and sherry (I was out of vermouth which is my go-to). I slowly added the lemon juice from there and pre dissolved the bouillon in warm water then added it to the onion mixture in pan to boil. I added basil and fill to the chicken rub which added a nice burst of flavor on top of the juice. Definitely make extra juice, I served this with a Greek style potato salad and the juice was an amazing addition to that. I doubled the garlic all around since we're garlic lovers. I thought I cooked the chicken too much and thought it would be dry since it was completely done (1.5lbs chicken) in the crock in about two hours and left to sit another 4 before dinner. I was wrong! Super moist, tender, and fell apart when stabbed with a fork! Packed with flavor, definitely making this again and possibly adding capers over pasta. Yum!

Yes, I did make changes...added the lemon zest, the bouillon cube instead of the granules and (someone wrote in to add) a cup of water after it had been in the crock pot for a while (instead of water, I used a cup of white wine).  The problem was that the sauce was really thin.  The chicken was fall off the bone tender, but it just had no There there.  It needed more...perhaps raw onion rings (which cook just fine in the crock pot), mushrooms, peas, even some dried cranberries would have been good---for color if nothing else.  Sorry, I won't be making it again.  I threw out over half of my dinner plate.

So easy and delicious. I did sautéed an onion and baby portobellos after browning the chicken, doubled the water/bouillon and juiced one large lemon. Then I added a slurry for a more gravy-like sauce and threw in some spinach to wilt. Served with cous cous and it was a hit. Very light lemon flavor and comforting. Leftovers are even better.

I MADE THIS FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT AND IT'S A KEEPER. IT TURNED OUT MOIST TENDER AND TASTY. INSTEAD OF THE CHICKEN GRANULES I USED "BETTER THAN BOUILLON" CHICKEN FLAVORED. I ALSO SEASONED THE CHICKEN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SALT AND PLENTY OF ONION POWDER, BEFORE I USED THE  OREGANO RUB.

This was an easy recipe and turned out good. I added white wine and less water to the recipe.  I would recommend more wine and possibly some lemon zest to add to the flavor.  I will  make it again trying the wine and more lemon.

My children said this was the best chicken I ever made and I truly enjoyed it myself. The only change I would make for next time is add more water because the boulion cube made it a bit salty. Otherwise dinner was awesome.

I made three times the amount of broth for the crock pot since other posts suggested it didn't make enough. Glad I did. I also added about a tablespoon of capers. Once the chicken was complete I removed all the broth and added it to a skillet, then added flour to make a "gravy" which I served over spaghetti. It was divine!!

We did not like this at all.  The chicken breast came out dry and tough.  I added a little  extra liquid as many suggested but this turned out like boiled chicken.  Might have been better with chicken thighs.  Will not make again.

I made this recipe as it was written, and it tasted amazing! I would say that for my slow cooker I only needed to cook it for about 5-5 1/2 hours rather than 6. Otherwise it was very flavorful and delicious. Served with rice and veggies.

I made it with two chicken breasts and used the recipe for 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker. I followed directions and cooked it 2 1/2 hours instead of 3 and it was dried out and tough. Will never make it again.

I am not sure why the rave reviews.  Maybe it was the lemon pepper I added (per other reviewers suggestion) that gave it a funky flavor, or the fact I used chicken thighs  because thats what I had on hand.  It just didn't really taste that great to me.  It was sort of bland, even after added a dose of fresh ground pepper.

I use this recipe weekly for meal prep for my husband's lunches. I use 2 cups water with 2 bouillon cubes like most. To change it up I replace all other seasoning ingredients with grill mates flavor packets so he gets a new flavor each week.

Really good tasting recipe, but there are a few adjustments that need to be made.  I cooked on low for 5 1/2 hours and probably that was 30 minutes too long.  The 1/4 cup water called for was not nearly enough.  I used 1/2 cup and will add an additional 1/4 cup if I make this again.  Also remember that butter can burn at reasonably high heat, so brown the chicken on medium, or else use olive oil instead.

A bit more garlic and big chunks of button mushrooms, deglazed pan with white wine, added more to slow cooker.  Toward end added green beans. I would have preferred peas but didn't have any. Very good on rice!

I thought this was so-so. It's an easy dinner and definitely didn't taste bad. The chicken was nice and tender. It was just kind of boring. I'll make this again only if I'm desperate.

One of the few recipes I've ever made that I did not like at all. I just don't think the lemon flavor is conducive to a Crock Pot. I will not make it again.

I made this for my husband the other night, and he really enjoyed it. I used Mrs. Dash Original for the spices since husband is watching sodium intake. I also followed others' advice and added more liquid in the form of white wine and salt-free chicken bullion dissolved in water, 1 cup each. Since I love using my pressure cooker, I browned the chicken in it, then added the liquid and cooked on high pressure for about ten minutes. I served it over brown rice. So easy and really tasty.

I enjoyed this recipe but I used my own vegetable broth. And cook vegetables with it as well so it would be extra juicy.

Instead of cooking the chicken in the skillet first, I just put everything in the slow cooker at once, cooked on high for 2 hours and the chicken came out great!! It was moist, easily shredded, and really good with the spices rubbed into it.

I added a 1/4 cup sherry to sauce and used chicken broth instead of water and bullion.  Plus I added 2 tablespoons of half and half.  Very satisfying and a keeper for my family.

Loved this recipe and it was my first slower cooker recipe. I doubled the "sauce" as recommended by adding an extra teaspoon of bouillon and 1/2 c of water instead of 1/4. Instead of noodles and to cut down carbs, I made cauliflower rice.

Wow, so good! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe! I followed suggestions and put a sliced onion in the bottom and 2 slices potatoes and also used broth instead of water (about half a large box of chicken broth.) amazing!!

Made this tonight, lemon flavor was good, but chicken came out dry.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours.  Hardly any sauce left and a little too salty for my liking.  If i were to make it again i would double the sauce, watch the cooking time, and put less salt.

To be honest, I didn't care for this one.  I do really like Chef John's Lemon Greek Chicken recipe - I was hoping for something similar, that would cook in the slow cooker instead, but it didn't end up quite as good.

fantastic recipe!! i added some cornstarch at the end to thicken it up (the last 30 min of cooking). I also added a can of drained mushrooms, and then when it was all done I threw capers on top and tossed the chicken and sauce in noodles! Thank you!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for, and this chicken had great flavor. I agree with other reviewers that extra juice would have been nice to serve with it, so next time I will probably double or triple the amount of fluid.

Wow! This was delish! I cooked according to recipe which I always do first time out. I had two large thick chicken breasts. Cooked on low 6 hrs and it came out perfect. I was concerned about the small amount of liquid but the chicken released some juices which resulted in just the right amount of liquid. I served over garlic flavored egg noodles and used the juice to moisten the noodles. Hearty dinner. Will definitely make it again according to recipe.

This recipe has become a favorite of mine. Try this with that Mexican oregano from the ethnic foods section. That really makes a difference. I usually make this with chicken thighs and use a pressure cooker.

First time making lemon chicken -- or even eating it for that matter --and the family really liked it. Tried to followed the recipe with the following exceptions (mostly because a lot of reviewers said it was bland):

- Pounded chicken breasts thin to help cook more evenly/faster
-  added basil to the spices
- used fresh juice from 3 lemons
- used 2 15 oz cans chicken broth (instead of water & bullion), we like extra sauce
- thickened sauce with corn starch
- baked in oven at 350 for 30 minutes (didn't have time for crockpot but will try it that way eventually)

Served with plain spaghetti noodles, steamed broccoli and garlic bread...oh and fresh Parmesan sprinkled on top.

Thanks for another meal in the rotation.

Great recipe with a couple of tweaks. I used lemon & pepper seasoning instead of the salt, pepper and oregano since we are not fans of oregano, doubled the sauce using all chicken broth instead of water, a lot more garlic and lemon, and I also cut the very thick chicken breasts into 3" pieces before sautéing. I browned all sides to lock in the juices and then cooked for 6 hours on low. Just before serving I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce and I served with steamed rice and steamed broccoli w/lemon that I mixed together and my family wants it again tonight!  What a cost effective, hearty and delicious meal!

I took the suggestions others made and used more liquid in this recipe.  Rather than water and bouillon though I used chicken broth.  I also added white wine. and more lemon juice.  I layered the bottom of the crock pot with potatoes and onions and then laid the chicken on top.  I also topped it with more onions (which were delicious) and 2 lemons cut in half as well as 2 more whole garlic cloves.  All in all it was very good and simple to prepare.  I'll make this again :)

Such a great recipe! I did what some of the other people suggested and doubled the sauce so that when it's over noodles, there is plenty! I also added a few more herbs to add more flavor such as thyme, basil, sage, marjoram and rosemary! Added half a cup of white wine and a splash more of water to make it superb! After it was finished cooking, I transferred some of the sauce into a pan and whisked in flour to make the sauce thicker. One of my favorite recipes.

This dish satisfied all the family members. My husband and daughter are more "plain" eaters and do not like gravies or sauces. I, however am in the category of more sauce the better. I made this dish according to others suggestions and added white wine along with more liquids. At the end of the cooking time I took the breasts out to keep warm and made of slurry of milk and corn starch to add to the liquid in the crockpot and turned it to high to thicken. It was a delicious chicken herb gravy.  I got my sauce and the rest of the family loved the chicken. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans it was an easy and tasty Sunday supper.

Used 2/3 of a carton of chicken broth and an envelope of chicken bouillon. Added 1 sliced onion to the slow cooker, and used the juice from a couple of lemons. Also threw in 2 small potatoes. I only used 1 chicken breast because it was just me that evening. It was delicious! It did me two meals: yummy chicken soup, and the lemon chicken/potatoes. I will definitely make this again

Great one and super easy. Chicken was fall off the bone. Used 3 cups of chicken broth, 1/4C lemon juice,  and basted the chicken in lemon pepper seasoning along with the recommended ingredients. Opted for 6 hours on low. Used corn starch and a little cream to thicken the sauce in a cast iron skillet after. Then added baby spinach for more taste. Came out perfect!

I misread the recipe and it still came out good!
I read 2 cups of liquid and cilantro (I don't even know how).  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe.  I cooked pasta in the leftover liquid then added frozen broccoli to the pasta at the very end plus a tablespoon of flour to thicken the liquid, plus an extra squeeze of lemon before serving.  It came out "saucy" and tangy and great.

My family loves this chicken so I make it every few weeks. I serve it over spaghetti squash. I don't brown the chicken. I just put all the ingredients in the crockpot and turn it on.    Healthy and quick.

We thought this was OK.  Made on a hot day where I didn't want to heat up the house more than necessary.  Used chicken broth rather than water and added liquid and more spices to double the sauce, as recommended.  Added cornstarch to thicken.  Took longer to thicken than I anticipated, but it did become gravy-like.  Worth a try!

not used to chicken cooked as much as this, too done for my preference. I thin the "gravy " would have been better made with flour rather than corn starch, also a little too lemony.
 will not make this again.

my husband refuses to eat all the ingredients in this recipe. he reluctantly tried it. ( thinking it was plain chicken, very picky eater) he had seconds and it has now become a regular meal in our home. none of it goes to waste between the kids and hubby. who rarely eat leftovers. love this recipe.

Not thrilled with the lack of flavor, and even with the reduced cooking time, the meat was tender, but dry.

This was a flavourful recipe but very very dry even though I doubled the liquid.   I would try it again but considerably shorten the cook time.

I wouldn't say that it was plain but it was dry. I added more chicken stock and wine. 
I'll try it again but this time I'll cook on slow for 3h to see if that's going to help chicken not to be dry.

Good, but a bit too salty!  I'd recommend low sodium bouillon, and cutting back on the salt for the rub.

Tasty and Tender!  I love this recipe and will definitely make it again.  I like more sauce so increased the fluids somewhat which included 1/2 cup white wine and then thickened it with
a little flour and water.  This dish is great served over mashed potato, rice or noodles with a leafy green and citrus salad.  The chicken cooked well in the slow  cooker for only 3 hours.

I added some diced onion and thinly sliced mushrooms to the garlic, lemon juice, chicken broth in the pan. I also put the lemon rinds in the slow cooker with everything, which really enhanced the lemon flavour and because I like a little heat, I added some chilli peppers. I also thickened the gravy after the breasts were cooked as suggested by another reviewer.

I gave this only 4 starts because of the cook time.  My chicken breasts were a bit on the thin side and 6 hours on low was about two hours too long.  Other than that the flavor was perfect.

Not a bad simple recipe, but even with additional garlic, boullion, and lemon it needed more zing.  It couldn't be simpler...decent taste.... you just need to amp up the flavor.  Will try this again, but needs even more modifications.

It was great! After reading reviews I used 1/2c water, 1/2c white wine, 2 packets of bouillon, 3 cloves of garlic and thin cut chicken cutlets. I did not brown the chicken before but I heated the liquids and garlic then just poured over the chicken. Cooked on high for 2.5 hours and it came out perfectly. I also added cornstarch in the last 30 mins. to thicken the sauce. It was excellent but I wish there was more sauce! I will definitely add more liquid next time. I also would have liked more of a lemon taste so I will add more of that next time as well. Served over angel hair pasta. Highly recommend; very flavorful.

I used Quorn chik'n cutlets. This doesn't look like much when u make it, but this is BEYOND AMAZING!! I put it over a bed of orzo and added a little vegetable stock to the orzo. Even my meat eaters LOVED this meal!!

The only thing I changed was chicken broth instead of bullion and water. I doubled the recipe. I had to leave the house while it was cooking, so I overcooked it a bit. I will probably use chicken thighs next time. Great flavor. Everyone liked it.

We really liked the flavor of the chicken but there wasn't really enough liquid to add to pasta as shown in the recipe picture. Next time I will definitely make more liquid. Due to the lack of liquid the chicken was a bit dry as well. I did add fresh spinach at the end when I added the parsley. It gave the recipe more umph in my opinion. I may try and add mushrooms next time.

It wasn't quite what I was expecting. Really just okay. Lots of flavor (but probably because I goofed and had to add extra seasoning to it), which was nice, but  I didn't really taste the garlic or lemon.  I might make it again to see if I can either follow the directions better or find a better way.

I have made this and enjoyed it for a change from my tried and true recipe. Try using lemon rind grated from 2 lemons instead of the juice .....plus put 10 whole garlic clove in  skin and all. instead of water use a can of coconut milk. You will love it.

REALLY GOOD.  I didn't make it exactly as posted, I didn't have the correct spices, so used poultry seasoning and Italian seasonings.  Instead of a 1/4 cup of water  and bullion cubes, I used a can of chicken broth.  I was in a hurry, and my chicken was still mostly frozen,  I was still able to brown it tho.  I put the browned  chicken into the slo cooker, slightly cooked the mushrooms in the fry pan, put the capers and garlicin, added the can of broth into the fry pan, got all the brown bits up then poured it over the chicken, set it on low and walked away.  We got home over a hour late, I was scared we would have rubber chicken, it was DELICIOUS it was fall apart wonderful, will make this again and again, served mashed potatoes and carrots as a side.  Thanks a million for the recipe.  I did find that most of the liquid was gone, so was really glad that I went with the can of stock, not the 1/4 cup of water.  Make this recipe without reservations, a very delicious meal that everyone really enjoyed

I have made this twice.  I had the best results when I doubled the sauce, reduced the salt, and thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch at the end (mixed with cold water).  I also sauteed a diced onion with the diced garlic before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.

The house smelled delicious when I made it but tasting it.....it was very bland.  We didn't taste the garlic at all and although my daughter said she got that lemon taste, my tastebuds refused to find it.  But I'm not giving up on this recipe, it's very visually pleasing and from other comments I've read, very forgiving!  So I will make this again but try some other things....like white wine, shallots, and capers!  I followed this recipe as described with the exception of concentrated lemon juice and two bouillon cubes instead of one.  The sauce it made was great though, next time I'm going to thicken it up a bit so it sticks to the chicken.

This was a big hit with my family, especially the kids.  I did make some changes. The chicken breasts I had were very thick, so I cut them in half before rubbing them with the spice mixture and browning them.  I subsituted chicken broth for the bouillon and water.    I like my food well seasoned so I doubled the amount of pepper and oregano and used a bit of more garlic and 2x as much lemon.  I was happy to find a slow cooker receipe that works well with chicken breasts.  To me the only dowside to this recipe is that the butter (which tastes great) is not that healthy, I may try substituing an alternative oil for some of the butter in the future.

Triple the liquid otherwise not enough to go over rice.  Best chicken I've ever made.  I used Greek oregano because that's what  I recently bought.  I don't know  what a difference that makes, but it was excellent.   Add more oregano than it calls for.  I probably added twice as much.

I've made this twice so far, once per the recipe. Second time I cooked the chicken for 15min on a stovetop pressure cooker, and it came out the same (easy to fork-shred, infused with flavor). To facilitate this I used 1cup water, 3T lemon, and still just 1 chicken pellet. Quick-release the steam, then return to a near boil uncovered for a few minutes, mixing in the parsley and optional cornstarch.  The extra sauce was great over mashed potatoes. Sautéed shrooms were also a good addition. 

Great for leftovers - stuff into a pita with hummus, olives, and rice, or shred the chicken and make a panini.

As is, it was a little dry. I ONLY use 1 1/2 chickent breast( 3 pieces)  Next time per another reviewer I'm going to deglaze with a shallot and add1/2 c chicken broth, 1/3 lemon juice, and , about 1/2 c white wine.  Next time  sprinkled lemon pepper on the chicken before putting it on the pan.

I chose to use bone-in chicken thighs instead (make sure to brown a little bit longer), and cooked on high for 3 hours. Chicken was fall-off-the-bone soft, and the recipe is fantastic. I ate with by putting it on toasted potato bread and dipping that into the sauce. Will be making again!

This was very good.  I made a few changes, but it's very versatile so you can use whatever you have available.  I used chicken breast instead of thighs.  I layered yellow potatoes and shallots in the bottom of the slow cooker, laying the chicken breast on top and sprinkling the lemon, oregano, garlic and chicken bouillon on top. I poured white cooking wine over the top and added a little chicken broth later in the process.  I ended up with some amazing chicken potato soup.  Great flavor!!

My grown children ask me to make this every time they come over.  I did revise it a bit, but this is a recipe adaptable to personal taste.  I like to add lemon pepper to the chicken when I brown it, and I also tripled the amount of water and chicken bouillon and put a layer of potato chunks on the bottom of the slow cooker.  So good!

I made this recipe, because I had fresh picked lemons from my brother who lives in a much warmer climate and I had no idea what to do with all of them.  I dry my own herbs, so I tossed some chives in for color instead of my fresh parsley. I also used the zest from the fresh lemons. The house smelled delicious. This was really easy to make. A little prep work beforehand, and after a long day skiing, we came home to a dinner that practically made itself. We served it with a rice pilaf and green salad.

I did follow the other reviewers and added white wine.  I also used the flavor pack without salt  so I didn't think it was too saltly.  Kids didn't like it but hubs did.

I made this in the morning and before I left for work, my kitchen smelled great!  Only problem was I got sick during the day so instead of eating this for dinner, I got to hear how great it was from the rest of the my family.  If they could've put a straw in the pot, I think they would have!  They LOVED this dinner, I will definitely make it again and hopefully, I can eat it too.

This recipe was pretty good.  I ran out of lemon juice so I only used aout 1.5 tablespoons, rather than 3.  I also used a bouillion cube dissolved in 2 cups of water, rather than what the recipe called for.  When coating the chicken, I used 1 tsp of oregano plus 1 tsp of lemon pepper.  I will try it again when I know I have enough lemon juice on hand.

I used 5 large chicken breasts so I doubled the rest of the ingredients. Used a cup of unsalted stock in place of water. My crockpot runs hot so I cooked it for 1 1/2 hrs on high and then 1 1/2 hrs on low, maybe a little less.  I thought it was going to be dry but I sliced the breasts and served on a bed of rice with some of the crockpot juice on top and it was perfect.  I will make this again.

I made this as directed and thought the flavors were really good, but using the crock pot over-cooked the chicken. I'll use the ingredients together again, but will finish the chicken in the oven.

Pretty easy to make and very tasty. I pretty much followed the receipe to the letter. Next time I will take the advice of others and double the liquids and add cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I ended up with more or less soup. A tasty soup but soup nonetheless. I will make again!

It wasn't my taste.. Or maybe I made it wrong. I didn't like that the chicken didn't have much sauce on top with the noodles. I didn't really taste the lemon taste that I thought I would either. I might try and make it again.

I doubled the spices, used the juice of an entire lemon, and covered chicken w/ chicken broth.  Added green onions into crock.  Removed 1 hr before done.  Served with noodles or mashed pot.  Note to self:  quadruple liquid.

I'm giving it a 3 because my chicken came out dry. I did add more broth than suggested, and I was estimating the weight of the meat. It's my first time using a crock pot, so I wasn't sure if I should turn it off when I started to smell the dish. I think 6 hours was just too long to cook it. I read something on another site that said cook chicken on low maximum of 5 hours. So, I will try it again because it was easy and flavor was there.

Great little recipe. Needs alittle more flavor and less cooking time for moist meat. I used chicken stock instead of water, doubled the seasonings and used 2 lbs of bone-in breasts with skin on to lock in some moisture.  I peel the skin off when time to eat. These only needed 2 to 2 1/2 hours in the crockpot on high. I, like some others, put some cornstarch in the broth to thicken it up for a light sauce.

I made this and used a few suggestions such as, 1/4 c. white wine, increase the water to cover the chicken because I needed it to cook on low for 6 hours. It came out delicious and moist. After I removed the cooked chicken, I boiled down the sauce in a saucepan. The sauce was excellent over the rice. Great slow-cooker chicken recipe and I will make this again!

I added more liquid as suggested by other reviewers, so that I could turn it into some sauce for pasta.  I used one cup of water with a teaspoon of chicken bouillon granules.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours, then low for one hour.  The chicken was nice and tender, not too overcooked.  I felt it was very salty, so I added half a cup of water, then used half a cup of water with cornstarch to thicken it up for sauce.  This evened out the salt.  My husband loved it, but I thought it was just ok.  If I make it again, I will leave out the oregano, as I felt that was an overpowering flavor for this.

This was SO good and SO easy!  I did make a couple changes, probably doesn't need them, but I always tweak recipes a bit.   I used a mix of butter and olive oil to brown chicken.  After browned I sauteed some onion and I used TONS of garlic, my family thinks the more the better!   I also zested a lemon, along with the lemon juice and used homemade chicken broth (2 cups instead of 1) instead of water and bouillon.  And I added a couple tablespoons of capers and poured a bit of caper juice in.  I let all this simmer for a few minutes and then poured it over chicken in slow cooker.   When it was ready, I made some plain arborio rice according to directions.  I served by shredding the chicken, mixing that with all the broth/cooking juice and the rice.  I get RAVE reviews for all who try it...it is even better second (third day)!

This is a an easy to make, delicious slow cooker chicken recipe!  The only change I made was the sauce, it was a little too bland for our taste. I added 1/2 a tablespoon more lemon juice to the sauce with a dash of pepper, then it was just right.  I served it sliced with the sauce spooned on top with mashed potatoes as a side.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this twice now and it just gets better with practice. I changed it up as others had. 1/2 cup of riesling wine, 2 cups of water, 4 teaspoons of minced garlic from a jar, 1/4 cup of lemon juice from a bottle, 3 teaspoons of bouillon, and one package of McCormick's chicken gravy.
I also cut up 3 potatoes, 1 onion, 3 stalks of celery, 2 carrots and a leek. the vegies went in first, chicken on top, poured hot liquid over all and sprinkled the gravy mix on top.  Wow...tender, juicy, thick sauce and ready to eat in 4 hours on 300.

This is EXCELLENT -- but the recipe is wrong!  Multiply the spices and sauce x4 -- otherwise the chicken gets dried out -- plus the juices are the best part, so why skimp on it?  Serve over white rice!

So delicious!  One of my new favorite recipes.  Very easy to prepare and the chicken turns out so moist and tender.

My Modifications:
Zest of 1 lemon.

After seeing that the juice mixture does not cover the chicken:
Melt 2 TBSP of butter,
Mix in 2 TBSP of flour,
Add 1 can chicken broth,
Add seasoning (Oregano, Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, etc),
Bring to boil while mixing,

Add to Chicken.

This is a good, easy recipe that makes tender fall-apart chicken IF you follow the suggestions from reviewers, as a 1/4 cup of water is simply not enough. How you decide to tweak the recipe is up to your own tastes and preferences, but with five large pieces of split chicken breasts, I used two cups of chicken broth. I also used olive oil in place of butter for browning the chicken. For a first time recipe, it came out just fine!

Very good.  I used just over 2 ponds of chicken breasts and I had to double the Oregano, Salt and Pepper.  Served over wild rice.  Will definitely make it again.

The grocery store did not have chicken breast so I used skinless chicken thighs. I also added fresh mushrooms. I took some else's suggestion to thicken the sauce. I removed the thighs from the crockpot and placed the liquid in a saucepan. I added a little flour to thicken the sauce and poured it over the chicken. I saved some of the sauce, let it reduce a bit  and added spaghetti. This recipe was great. I will definitely make it again.

This meal was too dry, I was disappointed.  I made it with angel hair pasta, luckily I had cherry tomatoes on hand that saved the day.

I will definitely make this again.  The whole family loved it, including my super picky 6 yr old.  I used 2 LARGE garlic cloves, minced them and added to the pan while browning the chicken.  I used about a cup, maybe a little more,  of chicken broth in place of the water and bullion.  I increased the lemon juice to 1/4 cup.  I did not add parsley.

I recommend using less salt! I used one chicken bullion cube and it tasted great. Could use some spiciness to taste, next time I will add crushed red pepper. I did on high for 3 hours ... Moist and delicious

I made the changes as the others suggested, and the chicken still barely had any flavor.  The sauce is also too watery, I recommend thickening it, or turning into a gravy. I won't be making this again.

VERY lemon-y. Not much of a sauce to it if you are going to put it over pasta. The chicken came out a bit on the dry side, too. Not planning on a repeat performance for this one.

This was incredibly easy and so delicious! Tons of flavor and just melt-in-your-mouth good. I had just under two pounds of chicken and needed to double the spice rub. I also used pre-diced garlic, a vegetarian bullion cube, and a little extra pepper and lemon juice. I will definitely be making this again!

I love this meal. It's tasty and it easily falls apart on my fork. I prefer crock pot chicken over baked chicken any day. I make a large batch on the weekend so that I can spread the leftovers throughout the following week. It's an easy healthy recipe since it has low fat and low sodium.

This was easy, quick and the leftovers were completely eaten! Next time I'll try a few different things. I saw some others substituted chicken stock, added white wine & skipped the time in the skillet.  Looking forward to trying these tweaks.

I didn't brown the chicken ahead of time, I just tossed it in the crockpot with the broth and the rest of the ingredients. I'm sure browning would be a nice touch--I just do crockpot for simplicity so browning was just another step. 
I followed everything else to a T. It was perfect. We had it with Lemon Butter Herb Pasta which was fantastic! I was able to use the broth to make the sauce for the pasta and it was a quick and easy meal.  Definitely recommend doing this chicken along with this pasta. It made for a very delicious meal.

I tried this chicken tonight and it turned out really good. I used 5 frozen chicken breasts and thawed them out just enough for the oregano and garlic to stick. I didn't really measure any of the ingredients. I used about a tbsp. of oregano, 2 cloves of garlic and the juice from two lemons. I was worried the garlic would be too much, but it had a nice flavor. I used 2 tsp of concentrated bouillon liquid and 1 cup of water. I also sprinkled some lemon pepper seasoning on it before adding the liquid in the slow cooker. I cooked it on low for about 4 hrs and the chicken was still partially frozen when I started. My picky ten year old recommends that I make it again, so I say that's a win

Very Tasty.  I served it over noodles.  I wish the sauce had been a bit thicker to stick to the noodles.  Doesn't matter my husband loved it and already talking about me making it again.

I made quite a few changes. No bouillon which eliminated the high sodium (yay!). Sprayed bottom of crock pot w/ olive oil Pam. Placed a layer of onion (1 whole good size onion total in recipe) & chopped garlic (2 bunches of cloves total in recipe); laid the chicken breast on top of those; placed more onion & garlic on top of chicken; added 4 mushrooms, thickly sliced, sprinkled basil, rosemary, & oregano then squeezed a whole lemon and dropped the rinds on top. Poured a 1/2 cup white wine & 1 cup low sodium chicken stock over everything. Cooked on Low for 7 hours. 
Super juicy and full of rich flavors

Everyone really enjoyed this dish. It was easy to prep, not too much money in ingredients and was a good solution for picky eaters in the family. 

My ding would be that it was too salty for my taste, but that's an easy fix. (Two guests who love salt said it was great!) I served five with this dish without leftovers (2 men, 2 women, 1 teen).

This is good. Doubled the water, bouillon, garlic and lemon juice to have more sauce to spoon over pasta.

Made it as the recipe states just increased some ingredients.. Added enough water to almost cover the chicken.. I used chicken tenders instead of breast.. Added more bullion granules.. Garlic and basil. I didn't brown the chicken either.. I felt like that was unnecessary.  The last hour I added a little milk, cornstarch and flour to thicken the sauce.. It turned out very good! My 17 month old loved it! Will definitely be making again!

Easy, fast and Excellent.  I did need to double the sauce to even begin to cover the chicken in the crock pot. I used the suggestion to thicken sauce with corn starch and use it to garnish the chicken as well as the rice/noodles served with it.  Watch the chicken temperature - check it with an instant read about 1.5 - 2 hours.  3 hours on low was way too much

Easy and moist.  This was so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with outcome.  I doubled the recipe so I would have chicken left over to make chicken salad.  The chicken was so tender, I pulled the left over chicken instead of cutting it.  Added finely chopped green onions, sliced almonds, finely chopped celery, golden raisins and Hellman's mayo.  It was a hit with my husband.  Also, with the remaining liquid, I froze until the next time I make chicken with orzo and will use this as the broth!!!  This is definitely in my recipe box with a LARGE A+. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very tasty except the chicken was very dry.  In the past ,  I have tried other slow cooker chicken recipes wit the same dry result. I thought this recipe would be different given the comments and suggestions of the reviewers. I think I will try brining ........

Delicious over angel hair pasta!  Doubled all the spices for 4 chicken breasts.  Then thickened the sauce 30 minutes before it was done with 2T cornstarch and 1/4c water as another reviewer had suggested.

Well, first of all it was delicious! I did not use  dried oregano, as I did not have any on hand.
I used teragon instead. I agree about adding more butter and lemon juice to have more sause. It did not need six hours on low in my cooker. I also would add more garlic. 
This was easy quick and a keeper for my family

I will definitely make this again! Next time I would add capers tho... Think that would just finish this recipe off. I did more than double the amount of sauce so I could pour it over the linguine I served it with. Delicious!

I followed the suggestions by posters. I used the chicken broth and thicken the sauce. The flavor was good but not great. I don't know what could have improved it. It was just ok, but not great.

This was delicious.  I also added a cup of white wine to deglaze the pan, a cup of chicken stock,  doubled the garlic, and because I like a little heat, a teaspoon of crushed red pepper.  Other than that I made as directed.

This recipe was fantastic! I altered it by adding some fresh tarragon to the slow roaster when adding the fresh parsley and also by serving it with a cherry tomato sauce over the top of the chicken and linguini. I will definitely be using this in my rotation =)

Easy recipe for moist good tasting chicken. I'm not a fan of having to brown it ahead of time but only used one pan. I did use a cup of water instead of 1/4 cup and added some more garlic. I had some bow tie pasta sitting around and used that to sit the chicken on. Nothing super special but easy and would probably make again.

Was not impressed....we are a flavor filled family. Dish lacked any POW factor and was very bland. I loved the way it smelled in the beginning stages but left much to be desired as the end result. I would tweak this by adding sautéed fresh veggies and thickening the sauce a bit with a roux.

I made this last night and was pleased how easy it was to put together and then go on with my day.  My husband enjoyed it and was happy how well it shredded.  He heated up flour tortillas and topped with cheese and was pleased.  He thought it had too much oregano, but I think it was the lemon juice.  I will definitely make it again!  I know it is a keeper when he takes it to work the next day for lunch!

I really like the convenince of making this in the slow cooker; however, the flavor wasn't quite as good as I was hoping, and the chicken breasts were actually a little drier than I was expecting.  Still a good dish, but I may tweak it a little next time to get the chicken moister with a flavor more along the lines of what I want; I'll probably read through the reviews for tips from others before I make it again.

I followed the video instructions, using wine and chicken broth rather than water and chicken bouillon.  I also added the baby carrots and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I found it very flavorful and served it over rice.

Loved this recipe! Easy to make and delicious. This will become a frequent dish in my home.  But I hate to say I did change one little thing- I just had to add a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan.

Really nice lemon flavor carried into the chicken.  Chicken was fork tender from the slow cooker and with carrots and potatoes added was a great meal.

My son loved this, and he's been complaining about everything I make lately! I followed the directions as posted, since I hate when people give recipes lots of stars, but they have altered almost everything about the recipe. I felt the chicken was a little bland, and there was not much liquid in the crockpot, but I don't think the chicken was dry.

I followed the recipe except I didn't add parsley and I cooked it stovetop in a dutch oven. Also because some of the recipes said it was plain, I added some lemon zest and mushrooms to the sauce. While it wasn't bad, I don't think I'd make it again.

Very good but not amazing.  I didn't thicken the remaining sauce as recommended but I will next time.  The flavor with the baked on spices was tasty.

This is a GREAT recipe to play with.  It has excellent flavors - I started it almost exactly as stated, then checked the reviews and noted it suggested more liquids so added more water and tasted to be sure the flavorings were o.k. My husband loved it with rice - I only giving it a 4* because of the changes one would probably make. I don't think you can go wrong with this even the way it is !

Chicken was very tender.  The recipe was very easy to make.  My picky kids loved it.  I did use lime juice instead of lemon, because that is what I had.  Still tasted great.   Thanks!

Delicious tender and moist. I used chicken broth instead of water and a bulion cube. Nest time I might add more lemon juice. Several reviewers mentioned it got too watery. I used the paper towel across the pot under the top trick.

The blandest, most uninteresting meal I had in years. I did exactly like in the video (even though I added an onion, and some mushrooms) and it was squishy, unflavorful, definitely an epic fail. I tried to modify it once it was cooked (adding sauce, more herbs, anything...) but it was a miss.

I followed the recipe exactly so I don't know what I did wrong but this was just a basic cooked chicken breast with a little browned lemon juice on the bottom. Maybe I am missing something but it just tasted like a dry piece of diet chicken.

Very flavorful.  Made as written with the exception of additional garlic and some garlic powder added to the rub.  We love garlic in this house.  Served the juices over brown rice.  Delish.

Followed the recipe exactly and did 6 hours on low.  It came out overcooked and bone dry but had good flavor.  Need to add way more broth and cut cooking time

This was great! I did as other users suggested and boiled the bouillon cube in 2 cups of water. I then added 1c after that boiled. ELLISSE's review was perfect and followed it. Only difference is I can NEVER make gravy. I removed the chicken at the end and used a cornstarch and water mixture to thicken it up, but it didn't work well for me. Regardless, I served it over rice and it was great!

I make this often, although I add a lot of extra oregano, garlic, and lemon juice. I also use chicken broth instead of bouillon. It is delicious! I have to admit that I drink some of the broth after it's done because it's so amazing!

There wasn't enough seasoning to cover the chicken so I made more.  That made the dish too heavy on oregano.  The chicken was very tender and I served it over brown rice.  Kids weren't hot on it.  I ended up using the leftovers in another recipe.

It came out a bit like a soup, but I did 2.5x the recipe, so that might be why. 
I used ~4c water and 1c white wine and 2 bullion cubes. 
It wasn't too salty, but it probably would have been fine without the salt anyway. 
I also added 2 tbsp almond flour at the end to give some substance to the broth.
The chicken was super tender.
I'd be curious to follow the recipe more strictly, but I was just worried that with some of the chicken in the broth and some of it out (within the crockpot), it wouldn't all get cooked/tender to the same degree.

Really love this recipe, but the cooking time was to long. If I wasn't watching, the chicken would have been waaayyy overcooked by the time the time was up. As it stands though, the recipe itself is truly delicious.

I doubled the recipe since I had extra chicken and cooked on low in the crockpot. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the seasoning mix for the chicken and used organic lemon juice. Really great chicken...even ate some cold the next day and it was yummy!!

I have made this recipe numerous times, instead of using boulion I added 1 cup of chicken stock. I also sliced a half of lemon and added to the crockpot. To keep it from drying out when it is close to being served I shred it and let it continue to cook. I either put it over rice or orzo.

I didn't brown the chicken first, and I used chicken broth rather than water. I also added some dried basil, and used lemon juice from the plastic container along with one fresh lemon squeezed in the crockpot. Then I cut the squeezed lemon into slices and left it in the crockpot to simmer. Wonderful! I'm known for being a lousy cook, so it was quite nice to have my boyfriend (who's an excellent cook) compliment what I made :)

Good!  Used 6 breasts cut in half.  I didn't sear beforehand.  Used Lemon-Herb seasoning instead of Oregano, salt and pepper.  Dissolved one chicken buillion cube in 2 cups of water along with the butter.  Cooked on low for 4 hours.  Made plenty of liquids.

My kids liked this a lot, which is a great review in itself!!! But I do agree with the reviewers that said the chicken turned out tasteless. Seemed the carrots I added soaked up all the taste but the chicken didn't!! I did thicken the juices at the end to serve over the chicken (and rice that I served with it), so that definitely saved dinner. I'll make this again, keeping all this in miind.

This is the best chicken recipe me and my husband have ever had.  It was tender, juicy and delicious.  We didn't need a knife to cut it.  We even fought over the leftovers!  A keeper for sure.

Easy recipe. Unlike some other reviewers, the chicken I got was moist and delicious. The only thing that one might consider is whether to add the salt or not. Depends on your tastes. I also threw in some onions, carrots, and mushrooms into the crockpot. I'm pretty sure I added more liquid than the recipe called for too... I didn't measure. It all turned out quite tasty though.

We loved this recipe and I have been asked to make it again -- soon! I used minced garlic from a jar but added more than the recipe called for because we like garlic and I thought the jarred garlic might not be as flavorful as fresh. It worked out well. I also added a little more lemon and almost doubled the amount of boullion and will do that again also. The only other thing I would adjust is the cooking time. I slow-cooked on low for four hours and the chicken was a little too soft for me. I'll cut down the cooking time by at least 30 minutes next time. I like the idea of adding potatoes and carrots and making more sauce. Thanks Carla Joy for the recipe and you others for your suggestions.

This makes a great Sunday after church dinner. Definitely thicken the sauce and serve over noodles. Kinda like a scampi if you use the wine like suggested in other reviews.

I used all fresh ingredients with this recipe and enjoyed it very much. I was preparing it for some guest that arrived two hours later that expected and chicken was slightly over cooked due to this. I loved the combination of the flavors and don't understand why anyone would substitute. I will try again making sure it it only cooked the suggested amount of time.

Yummy with steamed rice and carrots.I didn't brown the chicken after reading a few reviews. I agree, don't brown and save yourself some time. Very tasty without browning.

Really enjoyed this recipe :). I too upped the liquid levels; with which I later added 1 1/2 tbsp xanthan gum to in order to thicken it up into a gravy-like mix. I added small whole potatoes, sliced carrots, & diced celery to the slowcooker pot as well. 2 1/2 hrs on high, and another hour on low = nicely cooked chicken that fell apart on my fork hehe. I wanna try this again with bone-in breasts & legs some time; or just a whole chicken. I added a photo compilation as well ;)

*Tip: be mindful of the spices. I added a bit too much pepper since I thought it seemed 'light', WHOOO it left a 'hot' sensation on my tongue after eating haha. Not a big deal to be honest, just thought I'd mention to not over-add more spices/seasonings unless you want a stronger flavor from em.

All in all, this is a keeper recipe for me.

Everyone in my family disliked this meal.  I reduced the amount of cooking by alot.  I cooked it for only 2.5 hours in the slow cooker and the chicken was still incredibly dry.  The oregano overpowered the chicken .  Will not make again.

This recipe is fantastic. I throw everything in the crockpot and check it periodically. I double the butter and garlic and add more broth as needed. I'm careful with the lemon because I can always add more. I serve with mashed potatoes and a green veggie. Excellent!!!

This was a good recipe. I definatly would decrease the cooking time as others suggested. Mine was a bit over cooked at 4 1/2 hours with boneless chicken breasts. Good flavor though, and over all a good recipe! Thanks!

The chicken was really moist--and had great flavor. I served it with couscous, and it was a huge hit.

A nice meal for company, because I wasn't busy fussing in the kitchen and could greet my guests.

Will definitely make it again!

This is a simple and delicious dish. It saved me the usual fussing that I tend to do when making dinner. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and I added a package of sliced baby bella mushrooms. I also substituted the butter for olive oil . It really hit the spot!

Very good.  I cooked mine in a dutch oven at about 260F for roughly 2.5 hours.  It came out excellently dry roasted though in the future I will probably baste it because my family would have liked it a bit moister.  I also ommitted parsely and rubbed on some paprika in step 1.  Great recipe!

This was okay - not bad but not great.  Chicken was tender but just didn't like it all that much.  Thanks anyway.

Easy and very delicious. Because my family likes dark meat (juicier & tastier), I used skinless, boneless chicken legs & thighs. Worked great!

My husband said that this was the best chicken he's ever had.  I thought it was a little dry but I just through everything in the crock rather than browning the chicken as directed so that may have been my problem.  Next time I'll use chicken thighs in attempt to have jucier chicken.

The family liked this. I did use chicken broth instead of the bouillon, but not enough to cover the chicken. I doubled the seasonings for the chicken and next time will not double the salt, found it a bit salty.  Only needed 4 hours on low.  Will make again.

Delicious meal prepared with ingredients that were in my kitchen.  The only change I would have made was to use slightly thicker chicken breasts.  We ate ours with pasta and marinara sauce, though it would have been fine on its own.

Very nice.  I added the juice of a lime which I had on hand but this overdid the citrus flavour - next time I will make it exactly as per the recipe.  I served this with To Die For Fetticini Alfredo from this website plus a green salad and it made an easy but perfect dinner.

I have made this a couple of times now. The flavor is really good and we love it over brown rice. The sauce needs to be doubled to keep the chicken from getting dried out, the second time I just added a can of chicken broth to the mix. Makes yummy leftovers too!

This recipe was great! We thought the amount of lemon called for was perfect since we like garlic more than lemon anyhow. I served with a side dish of garlic alfredo pasta, which was a perfect addition. The kids and DH kept raving about this, so this recipe is a keeper.

We thought this recipes was OK. I found that the seasoning you were suppose to put on the chicken only covered one chicken breast so I had to make the seasoning mix for each one. I couldn't tast the lemon or the garlic so I would add a little bit more of that and a little less oregano next time

This recipe was flavorful and great. I'm surprised that others felt it was bland. My family thought it was very flavorful and even those don't like chicken ate it up. I served it with garlic couscous from a box.

This is a really great chicken dish....the aromas in the house while making it were unbelievable!  My husband came home from workand immediately wanted to know what I  was cooking...he is NEVER that excited about anything I make so I think I will be making this alot in the future.Very moist and great taste.

This chicken was easy and delicious!  I used olive oil instead of butter (South Beach friendly) and forgot about the parsley at the end.  We had some two days later and it was still very juicy.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  My husband and I love it.  The only suggestion I have is to use lots of extra rub mixture.  Also works great with chicken thighs.  Falls right off the bone.

This was ok. I put mushrooms and carrots in after the chicken had cooked. The chicken was very tender, but I just didn't really like the taste of this. Husband liked it so I might just make it for him again, but I may not eat it unless I make an adjustment that suits both of our tastes.

This was excellent!  I usually don't do chicken breasts in the crock pot because they get too dry, but these stayed nice and moist and the flavor was delicious.  As per some of the other reviews, I used a can of chicken broth in place of the water and granules.  I also doubled the oregano, salt, and pepper rub, but I don't think I will do that again because I think it made the chicken a bit too "spicy" for my kids and they wouldn't eat it.  However, I will be making this again.  
definitely make this again.

Very well recieved by my family. I had to double the herb mixture and I added a can of chicken broth as well as the chicken granules.  I thought it was a little salty, so I'll omit the salt next time.  I'll also add 2 cans of chicken broth, as it didn't have enough sauce. Served it with buttered rice and made a tossed green salad and broccoli for side dishes. My husband gave it a 10. This is a keeper and especially for the ease of this dish.  Thanks for sharing it. :-)

This recipe was missing something for my taste, it was too lemony and didn't make any sauce. I served it with white rice. It was okay, just not something I think I will make again.

This is my favorite meal for the crock pot. I use chicken tenderloins, so it takes a little less time to cook. I also add more of the liquids
so there is enough for the rice.
