An easy chili for evenings when you don't have much time... my six year old even ate it!

Easy recipe, I had plenty of sauce.  I used beans with jalapenos and tomatoes with green onions in addition to the spicy sausage and chili seasoning, so mine had a lot of kick.

There was no sauce. Ended up salvaging this by adding tomato sauce, beans and other seasonings.

It was okay. Just a bit bland
