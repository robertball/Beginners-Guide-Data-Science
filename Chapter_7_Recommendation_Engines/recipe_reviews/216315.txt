Delicious! The only change I made was using fresh pineapple and added water to thin out the soup sauce. I served it on top of Stir Fried Rice, another recipe from this site. Winner!

One star for how quick this came together. The soup completely muddled ALL of the other flavors. I should have know better...

We loved this dish and will use it again. It's a different take on a standard pork chop dinner, and was a nice chance from the usual. Thanks!

I made this for my boyfriend and I for dinner last night and we both enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly except I used one yellow onion instead of the green onions. I added more teriyaki sauce to my plate and next time I'll add more to the entire dish. I made some instant brown rice to serve with it. We'll be eating the leftovers for dinner tonight and will be making this again.

2 stars for simplicity.  It looks and sounds succulent, but when you get down to it, it's just another recipe with a lot of fluff covering a flavorless chop.  Sorry.  The chops themselves need more spicing up before the remaining ingredients are added.

I did not care for this recipe. The mushroom soup and pineapple was not a good combination.  I was expecting something sweeter, instead it was like mushroom gravy with pineapple in it.

we are huge fans of dishes with a gravy texture. the chicken and rice are absolutely amazing with the teriyaki sauce. you cant really call it a sauce though, its super thick. we love it!!!!!

Pretty good!  We liked it, and will def. make it again.  I used the pineapple juice, but left out the pineapples, because I'm not a fan of fruity meat...but we had it after dinner for dessert with some ice cream!
