3 1 18 ... No noodles, subbed with barley.  Quite bland, added carrots.  A good warmer-upper soup though.  Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention, all chicken broth & meatless.

This was a nice soup. I was serving this as a side dish so I left out the cubed beef.   The zucchini was cooked tender in 25 minutes.. cooking the zucchini per the instructions for 45- 50 minutes total would have turned it to mush.
