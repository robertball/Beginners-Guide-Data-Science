The chicken was nice and juicy and the squash tasted like sweet potatoes.  It was a good dish to have.

Excellent chicken! I did not have any squash and don't really care for it anyway, so I just used the glaze recipe on chicken and it turned out fantastic! Simple, cheap, easy; I'll be using this one again :) I put skinned chicken drumsticks in an oiled 9x13, baked for 30 minutes, flipped and glazed, then baked for 10 minues, basted, and finished with another 10 minutes. So yummy.

I made this dish in the oven of a wood stove for a southern 19th century living history farm, so we substituted a couple of ingredients. We used cane syrup instead of molasses and worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. I also tossed in a few potatoes along with the squash, and everything was FABULOUS. One of the best meals I've ever eaten. I think next time I will substitute sweet potatoes for the squash - the squash was difficult to peel when raw, although very tasty. One gentleman tried the juice from the pan on the fried turnips I made, and said that was a very good combination, as well.

Maybe my chicken legs were bigger or maybe I cut the squash too small but I found that my squash was mushy when the chicken was ready.  Good flavour though.

My husband made this for dinner tonight and it was a HIT!  We subbed chicken breasts and served it over rice.  Our kids were mixed on the squash but we loved it and we are adding it to our regular rotation of family meals.

The chicken was delicious but I think the squash would have been better cooked separately because it was so overcooked that it collapsed in on itself.  We had this dish with green salad leaves and a very nice soda bread with fennel seads and buttermilk from this website (not sure what its called).  It was a good dinner but I doubt I'll cook it again.

I so looked forward to this recipe and was rather disappointed.  The ingredients sounded great, but some reason the glazed didn't taste at ALL how I expected.  I thought it would be sweet, but it wasn't at all - not something I would pair with butternut squash.  I think the squash I used was not so good, perhaps, and may be partly to blame.  I very much WANTED to like this recipe, but I simply can't.

This is a good, simple recipe. I scaled it down to 4 servings and used a 13x9 baking dish. The meat was very tasty. The squash was okay. My husband and mother both liked it, but for me soy sauce and squash just don't go together. Next time I will try a different vegetable, maybe sweet potato. My husband asked me to put this on my "make-again" list, which, for him, is saying a lot! Edit: Ugh, Sweet potatoes tasted worse than the squash. Don't get me wrong though; the chicken tastes excellent. Now I just make this with the chicken and serve another vegetable on the side.
