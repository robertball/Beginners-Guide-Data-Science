I was wondering what to do with my excess celery and this was just the ticket.  I added diced orange sweet pepper which made it a tasty and attractive side dish, and used cider and white wine vinegar (had no lemon) and a touch of sugar in the dressing.

I liked this a lot. I omitted the cherries as I'm not keen on them. I also spooned the yogurt into a coffee filter and let the liquid drip away; this leaves the yogurt really thick and creamy. This was very refreshing. Thanks, Willow!

I am looking for more ways to fit fruits and vegetables into my diet and this fits.   Served it with Fish and sweet potatoes fries for lunch today.   My husband even said it was something he would enjoy taking in his snack lunches.   Used dried cranberries.   Thanks for sharing.

I love this salad.  I use dried cranberries rather than cherries and take it to work for lunch at least three times a week.  Delicious !

Thank you Willow!  This was decilious.  My whole family liked it, even those that don't like celery.  I substituted dried cranberries for cherries and lime juice for lemon juice.

This is pretty tasty.  I used dried apricots instead of cherries, used 1/2 the mayo and no yogurt, upped the lemon juice and added green onions.  Refreshing and simple.

Wow!  This is really good.  Made it with raisins because I was out of dried cranberries.  It was excellent, but I think it would be even better with the cranberries.  A veggie version of a waldorf salad.

I took cues from other reviewers and omitted the dried berries, and used 1/2 tsp (not 1.5 tsp) fresh squeezed lemon juice.  1/8 tsp salt and pepper is too much; should be a pinch each.  Toasted walnuts are better than toasted pecans in this salad.  It was so delicious and crunchy I got carried away and ate the whole thing right away and called it breakfast.  Will definitely make this again.

I didn't have dried cherries so I substituted raisins; increased the amount of celery and pecans by a bit and 'forgot' the lemon juice. This salad is fabulous, crunchy and not too fattening (I hope since I promptly ate about 2 cups--couldn't stop!).

I needed this recipe to get started but definitely tweeked it.  I used raisins and dried cranberries instead cherries, omitted the peas as my husband refuses to eat them and used fat free ranch dressing instead of mayo combo and added chopped pecans.  This salad went great with buffalo wings!

Delicious, refreshing, and guilt-free!  It is a side dish that pairs well with many entrees, fish, chicken, turkey, grilled meats, even cheeseburgers!  You could easily add grilled chicken for a meal.  I like it with imitation crab or lobster for a light lunch.  You can eliminate mayo and still good.  If watching sodium, add a pinch of Mrs.Dash garlic and herb salt free seasoning blend or use sea salt.  All easy ingredients to have on hand, sub dried parsley is ok too. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

Delicious! Thank you for sharing. Adding this one to the rotation... Some minor tweaks, give or take what was on hand: Cranberries instead of cherries, thawed soy beans instead of peas, walnuts instead of pecans, no mayo just yogurt

This is a great way to eat celery. Didn't have all the ingredients and it still turned out great.   Used raisins instead of cherries, peanuts instead of pecans, and left out the parsley.

I had to find a way to use two whole stalks of celery--one I bought and one delivered next day from my daughter.  This recipe fit the bill.  My husband raved so I've made it twice and still have celery to use up.  Thanks.

I normally would have passed this by but  I'm challenging myself to try new recipes and it was really good!  I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime.  I only had vanilla yogurt and it worked.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked this, but I was the only one.  It has a nice crunchiness to the salad, but it needs something to give it a little zip.  Not sure what that is.  I'm glad this made a small amount as I was left eating all of it.  The second day the salad does get a little watery.

Easy, crisp, and delicious!  Make sure to drain the yogurt using a coffee filter before mixing with the mayo.

I prepared this yesterday for a potluck. Rummaging in the fridge I found two bunches of celery. Came right to allrecipes.com to find a salad using a lot of celery. Bingo! Used toasted walnuts and cherry flavored Craisins. Delicious! Hubby said its a keeper!

Made as directed and am still somewhat up in the air on this one.  I love the crunchiness ... but I feel like I'm missing something.  Just made so will let sit in fridge until tonight and then see if it ups it a bit.  This isn't bad ... it's just, well, I don't know...

Wow. This is such a better way to deal with celery. I am so bored with smearing it with peanut butter or cheese. I always buy celery thinking I need a "healthy" snack only to have it become a snack of last resort. Like the others I substituted the cherries with dried cranberries because I had them on hand. I also added some raisins and sliced almonds. I went a little skimpy (about 1/2 tsp)on the lemon juice thinking I could always add more and I didn't need it. I will buy celery again to have this side salad on hand or to put on a turkey sandwich like a spread. Yum.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! It's delicious! I don't have frozen peas so I used canned peas instead, and didn't change anything. Will make this salad over and over again.

my favorite, really nice.
subbed craisins for dried cherries, canned peas for fresh and mayo for the yogurt.
also works without the lemon juice.

I wasn't crazy about this salad.  That's probably because I'm not really big on mayo.  The crunchiness was great, though!  I tried it with both dried cherries and cranberries and prefer the cranberries.  The nuts were a good touch, as well.

Tried and true recipe. I use real mayo but a little less. I also sub golden raisins for the cherries because I keep them in the house for bran muffins. If I have no fresh parsley in the house, I add a little dried dill or basil. This is my go-to when I buy a bunch of celery because I need just a couple of ribs for another recipe.

This salad is a really good with a couple of additions. I added a chopped apple,  a 1/4 tsp dried tarragon and just a shake of celery seed.  Like others I used dried cranberries in place of the cherries. My family, including those that don't care for salads, loved it!

I used items that I had on hand.  I used cranraisins instead of the cherries.  I think next time I will use the cherries.  I did not use the lemon juice or parsley since I didn't have.  I used only the mayonnaise since I didn't have any yogurt.  Both my husband and neighbor enjoyed it.  It is a definite make again.

It was okay, but nothing special.  First, I doubled the recipe.  Then I added more toasted pecan halves (chopped after toasting about 2/3cup), increased the cherries to an 8 oz. package, and added 1/4 cup of chopped black olives.  You just cannot have a salad that contains green peas without black olives!  Now, this was a hit !

It was refreshingly crunchy!  I used organic celery hearts &  regular mayo & Greek yogurt.  I will probably make it again as a nice change for my side salad.

This was okay for something different.   I followed the recipe except that I used all mayonnaise (no yogurt) and just a squeeze of half a lemon.  I didn't measure those ingredients because the amounts are just personal preference.

What a great way to feature celery!  It was pleasantly crunchy and with a little drizzle of honey extra good. I will definitely make this again.  Nice sub for coleslaw.

This one of those recipes that everyone needs in their back pocket for those days when something crispy is needed on a menu  and the fridge is almost empty. Excellent as written but very forgiving with reasonable substitutions from the pantry if needed. It is easy to overlook celery as s main ingredient

My daughter is on a "salad for school lunch" kick.  I feel I often make here the same thing over and over.  When I found this I knew I had to try it.  She really likes celery (it's one of the veggies she loves having sautéed or roasted - very nummy, btw).   The first time I made it I didn't have peas so I used diced green pepper but everything else as called for.  She loved it!  I served it over some lettuce so it still appeared somewhat as a traditional salad but good all by itself.  Just made it again with peas and so so good.  Definitely toast the pecans - what a difference that makes.  I go heavier on the yogurt than mayo as that's the preference.  I think by default I tend to go a little lighter on the lemon as I've been bit by that in the past, but at the same time, I love lemon and can't imagine not using it. So perhaps start light on the lemon and know it tends to fade in as the salad sits in the frig.  Good, healthy, fresh salad.  I get to eat some for dinner tonight as this was a rare day my daughter chose to eat school lunch!

Nice flavor combinations that are wonderful for a lunchtime salad. The dressing ended up a little too much for my taste, so I just added some extra celery and that did the trick!

I used cranberries and walnuts, and all mayo instead of yogurt because we're dairy free.  It was excellent and easy to make with things you usually have on hand.  Lots of fiber.

Very good!  Doubled the recipe, took it easy with the salt, and had to use dried parsley (1 tsp. dry = 1 Tbs. fresh).  Didn't have any plain yogurt so used sour cream--not a good choice.  It totally hid the sweetness of the cherries--made it too sour.  Added some vanilla yogurt to salvage the dish.  Still a 5-star recipe even though I messed up.  May use vanilla yogurt next time in place of the plain.  Very good recipe.  UPDATE:  Mixed about 4 spoonfuls and 1 spoonful of mayo with some leftover chopped turkey--great turkey salad in about 2 minutes.  Yum!

For a rather thick and creamy looking salad, it was surprisingly refreshing. The crunch of the celery with all the other ingredients is mouth wateringly good. The hint of lemon really enhances the flavors... so much so that I decided to add the zest of half a lemon to it. Definitely will make this again!

We loved this salad!  I was so happy to find a new way of eating celery.  We too used Craisins and toasted walnuts.  I had no yogurt so subbed lite sour cream.  I also added chopped peppers.  We were out of peas but did not miss them.  This salad was delicious and even tasted great the next day.  Ingredients can be easily switched up according to taste.  This is definitely added to my salad recipes.

Very tasty even without the peas!  I don't use mayonnaise  so I used Greek yogurt and a little extra lemon juice.

Great! Will make again! I doubled it for my family so I tried 1/2 dried cranberries(didn't have dried cherries) & 1/2 mandarin oranges (per another reviewer). Also, I subbed cilantro for the parsley but would really like to try mint another time because I think it would be wonderful.

I made this exactly as written with one substitution. Instead of dried cherries I added chopped apples. It was delicious!

Needed a crispy, cool salad for supper and had run out of lettuce.  This was very nice as a replacement.  I didn't have yogurt or cherries/cranberries, so subbed a little bit of ranch dressing and raisins.  The salad was delicious.  :-)

I really like this salad.  I could not find a single serve plain yogurt at the market so I got key lime yogurt and skipped the lemon juice.  It was great.  Also could not find dried cherries, so craisens tasted great too.

Simple, flavors. I enjoyed it over a bed of lettuce. This is a good way to use extra celery and is quick & easy to make.

This made for a great way to use up extra celery.  I accidentally overdid it on the lemon juice (my fault), but I still found the salad to be good.  I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries, because that's what I had on hand.  A refreshing change!

Yum. The dried fruit really "makes" it. More nuts would be ok too.

Always on the lookout for ways to use leftover celery (oh, how I wish you could by it by the stalk) and this is a good one. I don't like celery much but this salad was tasty. I used olive-oil mayonnaise, greek yogurt, dried cranberries, and slivered almonds.
