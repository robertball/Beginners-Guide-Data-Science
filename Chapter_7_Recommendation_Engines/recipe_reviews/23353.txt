I also pre-baked the graham cracker crust for 5 minutes first.  Also, I place all the graham crackers as a bottom layer, then a layer of chocoloate, and finally the marshmellows.  I would suggest pressing down the bottom layer with parchment or wax paper.  That seemed to help the "crumble factor"!

Update May 2010.  I now bake the layers in phases.  First the the graham cracker crust (which I added a little bit of brown sugar and half the white sugar).  Then I add a layer of chocolate chips, but I use the mini chips.  10 minutes in the oven.  When it comes out I spread the melted chocolate with a spatula.  Then I add the marshmellows and bake for 6-8 minutes.  Only until light brown.  After it cools, I put the whole pan in the freezer.  After it is frozen, let it sit for 10 minutes, cut when still slightly frozen.  Then I put the cut pieces back in a pan/container and back in the freezer they go.  When I want to serve them, I take out what I need.  Although my family has been known to eat them frozen.  They do NOT last. Enjoy!

Mmmmm....can't keep out of these! They were great! However, only eat them warm if you want to use a spoon. (they are still delish though) Once cooled they cut nicely in to squares. Still gooey, but hey, they're smores, right!? Anyway, followed the recipe exactly, ground the graham crackers not to finely. Next time I think I will do them finer, like a true graham cracker crust. As to there not being enough for the top, I suppose it's a matter of opinion. The amount I had left, made more of a crumble top, which I liked, it looked lovely. So, if you want a true crust top, use more crackers! Also, per other reviewers suggestions, I baked the bottom crust for 5 min. before adding choc. chips & marshmallows. Almost forgot, I also used 1/2 semi & 1/2 milk chocolate chips.  Great & easy recipe!

These were pretty good. The only thing i did differently was instead of baking it all at once, i baked it layer by layer. I started with the graham cracker crust(about 10min), then sprinkled the choc. chips (about 6min) once they were melted i spread the chips with a spatula. then i sprinkled the mini marshmallows on top&put it back in the oven till they were slightly brown&lastly i sprinkled some remainder graham cracker crust&let bake for another 5 min. turned out really yummy!! :)

These are so Yummy! I used real butter and all I had on hand were hersheys chocolate bars. So I broke up 6 bars to equal 2 cups. I will be making these again and I will continue to use the chocolate bars.

This is an incredibly easy and yummy dessert!  I make my graham cracker crumbs in a food processor.  Two packs of a box of graham crackers equals 3 cups of crumbs.  My 4-year old had a great time adding the chocolate chips and marshmallows and also enjoying the finished dessert!  Thanks for sharing!

You've got to try this is all I can say!   My family absolutely loved this and my hard to impress husband kept going back for more.  I halfed recipe and made in 8X8 pan. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup more graham crackers as the butter sopped up the crumbs and it was more mushy, than crumbly. The crust really makes it, so the suggestions to make extra are right.  The extra made just enough to cover top.  Per a suggestion, I baked crust for five minutes before adding marshmallows and choc. chips.  We ate them both warm and cold, and they are equally good.  However, you won't be able to cut them when warm.

My co-workers often request that I make this for our monthly food-day.  I find that if I make it the night before, and refrigerate it, they are not messy to eat, and cut easily into bars.

I wasn't sure if the 1c. butter was right- the "crust" was pretty soft.  I think next time I will try just 1/2c.  Don't get me wrong, we LOVED it!  A soft crust gets the chocolaty-marshmellowy goodness to your mouth just as well as a firm one, and our mouths were so full, we weren't really complaining.  Thanks!

we had marshmellows, graham crackers and chocolate candy bars left over from a rained-out campfire. I placed the grahams in the bottom of a 9x9inch pan then marshmellows on top of that then candy bars broken up and topped with graham crackers. Placed into a pre-heated 350* oven for 12-15 minutes. yummy!! messy, but yummy!

Ok...the only thing I can say is delicious.  I did make some more of the graham cracker mixture (per the advice of other reviewers).  Instead of the semi-sweet, I used milk and white chocolate (sorta a half and half mixture).  Made this for a supper at my parent and the adults and kids ate them up quickly...no leftovers.  Thanks for the post.

When I made this, they smelled so delicious we got impatient and ate them while still warm.  They were awful; just greasy, buttery, goo. I was going to pitch the entire pan, but luckily forgot to before bed.  The next morning my toddler who wouldn't touch it the night before got into it and loved it.  So I tried it again and it was fabulous!! Once completely cooled they were fantastic.

Great recipe!  I made this for a cookout and everyone went crazy over them1  I had 5 people ask me for the recipe.  I followed some recommondations in other reviews: I baked the crust for 5 minutes, added the chocolate and marshmallows (I used large and cut them in half) and baked for 5 minutes and then I topped with remaining crumbs and baked for 5 more minutes.  I also lined the pan with tin foil so after baking, I put the whole pan in the fridge for an hour then lifted out the foil and sliced into triangles.  They lifted easily and cut perfectly!

Perfect Indoor S'mores! I used a whole box of graham crackers (3 sleeves) and made crumbs in my blender. I found this amount of crumbs mixed with the butter to be perfect, it wasn't gooey or greasy at all. If you want to have a nice crust on the bottom and a completely covered graham top, you may want to use even more graham crackers. Like previous reviews, I also popped the crust in the oven for a little over 5 mins before adding the other ingredients. After baking we let it cool for about 15 mins and found it to be easier to eat with a fork. I refrigerated the rest of the pan overnight and found it to be VERY hard to cut, but making actual bars out of it was worth it. I LOVE my desserts cold, so I enjoyed a bar right out of the fridge...my hubby likes it better at room temperature or warmed up (if you want the true gooey s'more). Either way, I would definitely put it in the fridge again just to cut it. I know people were complaining about the sweetness of this dessert, I would think it may be because of the semisweet chocolate chips; and it's not so much "too sweet" as it is slightly bitter (in a good way!). I would use any chocolate that you LOVE. If you LOVE a chocolaty chocolate chip cookie, the semisweet morsels are for you! I am planning on trying this again with Hershey bars as well. Either way...it goes great with a glass of milk! Thanks for the easy and wonderful recipe!!

WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER!!  It was a greasy mess!  I felt like I could just feel the greasy going down my throat, eeww!  And no sugar needed in the crust, the chocolate and marshmallows make them sweet enough.  I will make them again, but with 1/2 cup butter and no sugar.

very yummy, but fatty.  Next time I might bake the crust for longer, I didn't and it was a little greasy and mushy still.  We thought it was good that day, but the next day when we dug into it, it was way better!

These were great! To let them fully cool, I had to wait around 20 minutes. However, my guests got impatient so we started eating them a bit warm. They were fine! The next morning, they were delicious. I ate them with a glass of milk. The other night one of the guests had asked for the recipe. The only thing I altered in this recipe was the graham cracker crumbs. I couldn't find those in my local store, so I just bought graham crackers and crushed them myself. I love s'mores, so this was a great recipe! Thanks!

I ended up getting rid of the whole pan.  They were easy enough to make, but the whole graham cracker, marshmallow, and chocolate in the microwave tastes more like a s'more than I thought these did.  Maybe with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and using whole graham crackers instead of crumbs would've made these better.  Sorry, I will not be making this again.

My son and I absolutely love these.  During the holidays we substitute some of the marshmallows with the various holiday peeps or flavored marshmallows.  They are delicious.

so simple and such a hit.  its a real crowd pleaser for sure.  its def important to let it cool so u can cut it, but i liked microwaving each piece for about 10 seconds to really make it all melty again, but not much longer than that or youll have a big mess on your hands.  anyway, ill def be making these again.  i did double the crust only because im a crust person and i used milk chocolate since i like that better as well.

I was disappointed in these, as a friend had made them, and they were delicious.  I made them, following the directions exactly as written, and mine tasted like they weren't done.  The graham cracker crust was still mois,t and the whole thing was soft and gooey, not like my freind's, which was more crunchy, chewy, and more firm.  Next time, I will do what she did - add much more graham cracker crumbs, and then bake after adding each layer.  She also left the whole thing in the oven for about 10 minutes after turning the temp off to firm it up.

If you're craving s'mores but can't or don't want to make them the traditional way, THIS is the way to do it! I accidentally only used 1/2 of melted butter for the crust so it was much more crumbly than actually crust but it's still REALLY Good. So, if you're looking to cut back on the butter you can do that, you just wont be able to cut it into bars later. I served it straight out of the oven and it is melty and delicious!(and MOLTEN hot haha) I used hershey bars instead of chocolate chips for that real s'mores flavor. It took about 8 normal sized hershey bars. It's delicious! If you're crushing the graham crackers yourself, it's almost all of an averaged sized box (3 pkgs inside the box).

Wow I cant wait to make (and eat) these again! My nephew was having his birthday at a campsite so i searched for possible smores recipes to make to bring to the party. Reading the reviews for this it sounded tasty and easy.  I also took notes on some of the reviewers suggestions.   I decided to buy a box of ready made graham cracker crumbs which equalled to approx. 2-1/2 cups of fine crumbs.  This qty worked out good for both bottom and top crusts.  I did not change any other quantities.  I baked the crust for 6 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients.  When all was done (and it was soooo easy to make), I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours and they cut up into squares really good with a pizza cutter.  Let me tell you , they are sooo melt in your mouth delicious!  I would recommend anyone to try it.

Had leftover ingredients from camping and turned out really good. Did make minor changes = prebake crust, used extra crackers for crust, slightly less butter(3/4C), regular hersheys broken into smaller pieces and regular marshmallows and squished them after baking. Everyone loved it!!

This was awesome. Had some friends over with lots of kids and made these and they were an absolute hit. Wanted a recipe as close to a s'more as possible that I could make all year and this is it. Did use the entire pkg of graham crackers (equal to 4 1/2 cups) with the one stick of butter and prebaked bottom for 5 mins. Thanks for a "memory making" recipe - s'mores at the beach.

This was easy to make, but a little sickeningly sweet. I cut the recipe in half and baked in a loaf pan - perfect size for 1/2 recipe. I'd probably cut down the margarine/butter because it was a little greasy. But, it did taste like a s'more!

What can I say...I have made it twice in the last week by request.  The kids love it.  I even had the "Picky" eater ask to give the recipe for his mom.  The only change I make is to make more of the Graham Cracker mix...It seems like when I get to the top there is not enough to cover the entire top, so I just add another cup of graham cracker crumbs/butter.  This is really a nice kiddy dessert recipe.  Great for sleepovers.

3.5 actually.  They weren't amazing, but still became quickly addicting.  Good both warm and cold.  We cooked the bottom graham cracker layer for 5 minutes before continuing with the recipe in order to minimize crumbling.  Worked out ok.  Make sure to grease the pan.  Milk chocolate chips might taste better as well.

I drastically changed the recipe by using non-fat yogurt instead of butter.  I mixed about three tablespoons of yogurt withe the graham crackers (which I'd increased to 2 cups) and spread them in a greased pan.  Then I cut up two large milk chocolate bars and placed them on the crackers base and then popped that in the oven for about 10 minutes until the chocolate started to melt.  Then I added the marshmallows and the remainder of the crackers mixture on top and kept it in until the marshmallows browned.  It's definitely best served hot while the marshmallows are still warm and gooey.  Very good!

Very tasty, but we definitely needed more graham cracker crumbs.  Next time I make it (and I will make it again), I will either use a smaller pan or more graham crackers.  Thanks!

Wonderful indoor treats! Even better the next day. To make it perfect, I use a little bit less than half of the graham cracker crumbs mixture on the bottom of the pan, so there is enough left to completely cover the chocolate and marshmallows. Has become a favorite.

I pre-baked the graham cracker crust for 6 minutes first. I also place all the graham crackers as a bottom layer, then a layer of chocolate, and finally the marshmallows. I bake the layers in phases. First the the graham cracker crust, then the layer of chocolate chips, but I use the mini chips. 10 minutes in the oven. When it comes out I spread the melted chocolate with a spatula. Then I add the marshmallows (5 cups = 1 small bag) and bake for 6-8 minutes. 
Note: 3 cups graham cracker crumbs = 1 whole box (3 packages). I make them into crumbs in my food processor. 2 cups chocolate chips = 1 bag.

Two stars because it was edible. The graham cracker part came out really hard and crumbly. The marshmallow part was also hard and stuck to my teeth. I wont be making this again.

Very delicious. I'm a huge smore's fan and I try to find as many twists as I can. This was awesome. I added a little wheat germ because I try to add SOME healthy aspect to these treats :) They were so easy. I baked the crust for five minutes before I added the other toppings. Nice recipe!

This recipe is so easy and won me first prize in the dessert challenge at my company's summer outing.  I refridgerated this overnight to make it easier to cut and it worked like a charm.  This is a winner and I will certainly keep this in my rotation for parties and gatherings.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

These bars are amazing! So easy to put together. I think next time thought I wouldn't put as much butter in the crust because it was a little too much for my taste and maybe not as many chocolate chips. Overall very good!!

Loved them and so easy to make!  I followed the recipe exact except I think I had a bit more than 3 cups of graham crackers.  They were completely cool when we cut and they made great bars and the crumb topping stayed on.  Fantastic!!!

Really good, I used them for a camp-out party instead of making s'mores. Since there were so many suggestions on how to make the crust, I decided to just make the Graham Cracker Crust I on this site. It was perfect! Use about 2/3 for the bottom, bake for 5 minutes, add the marshmallows and chocolate chips and press the remaining 1/3 crumb mixture on top. Finish baking, cool, cut, and enjoy!

Yum! I halved the recipe and used an 8 x 8 pan. Since there was so much talk about the amount of topping, I used about 2 cups for the halved recipe, and only about a 1/2 cup of melted butter. This prevented any greasiness, and I didn't have to prebake the bottom. I did bake it for about 20 minutes, but my oven is a bit outdated anyways :) Overall, yummy for those who like s'mores!

Yummy! I used Hershey milk chocolate bars and chopped them up and made a little more graham cracker mixture. Will make again!

This was super tasty.  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 in pan.  I also used milk chocolate chips.  It cooks a little longer than 10 minutes.

These are so good they might be the work of the devil.  I made them for a party for tomorrow night and have eaten, oh, about half the pan already by myself.  They were so easy to make, and so delicious, you can't go wrong by making these.

Really really sweet and messy. My graham cracker crust didn't hold together well at all. It was one of those spur of the moment things for me ... I saw the recipe and thought I'd try it. It's not something I'd normally make. It was okay though.

I made this because it's child-friendly; however, even though it tastes good, it's very messy to eat. I  cooked the base for an additional 5 minutes, but it was much too crumbly.

These were pretty good.  I should have used milk chocolate chips like other ppl suggested.  They went over very well with friends but the chocolate was almost to much, too heavy.

Great recipe.  I goofed though putting half
the mixture on the bottom of the pan.  I used
more than half so I left myself short when putting the rest on top.  Still turned out really good.  My husband and son loved them.  I didn't think the sugar was needed.  Spraying the pan first with pam was a great idea.  Would definitely make again.

I made this recipe to take to my husbands friends house but decided to try it out on my friends at work first!!  They loved it, and more so when I told them it only took me 15 minutes from start to finish!  I left it in the oven for 13 minutes instead of ten!!  Will for sure make again!! Thanks

I actually made these but due to limited ingredients on-hand, made them in muffin cups and they turned out awesome. I followed the recipe but instead of mini marshmallows, I used the regular size and since I was using muffin cups one on top worked perfectly. I just drizzled some of the graham topping on each rather than covering it. I was so happy with how they came out because I'm not usually one to venture into tweaking recipes. The cups may be a good alternative dependent on what you are making this for. Enjoy!

We loved them! They were super easy and fast to make, and super delicious! I used slightly less butter, substituted about 1/3 of the white sugar for brown sugar, and put the graham cracker mixture on the bottom only with just marshmallows on top. It's one of the best desserts I've made in a while. :)

I made mini dishes one with the original recipe and one with an Oreo crust. Both were delicious but I personally liked the Oreo one best. In the future I would also bake the crust by itself first.

This is a great recipe -- it's fool proof, quick and easy; a great recipe for anyone who struggles with baking (like myself).  I have made this several times and it is always a hit with whoever tries it.  Anyways, I wanted to post that I recently tried substituting 1/2 of the butter with mashed Avocado and it worked out great (I put 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup avocado).  My only suggestions if you try this are to 1) mash the avocado very well before adding and 2) mix it into the crumbs with your hands instead of a spoon.  Since it will be more of a paste, you need to work it into the mixture and it is much easier without the spoon.

Having made this both ways, I personally didn't notice a taste or colour difference with the avocado and neither did my guests.  If you are looking for a butter alternative, why not give this a try? It made me feel a lot better for eating as much of it as I did ;)

Awesome!!  I followed the advice of other reviewers adding more crust and baking in stages.  Very messy (eat with a plate and fork).  Next time I am going to serve it slightly warm with Rocky Road ice cream.  YUMMO!

These were very easy to make and delicious! I didn't have any graham crackers so I used crushed pretzel.  It was DELICIOUS! A fantastic salty and sweet treat. I followed suggestions of other reviewers and baked the crust first (5mins) then melted chocolate chips on top (5 mins) spread the chocolate chips with a spatula and then covered with marshmallows and back in the oven again until mallows were browned.  
These were devoured instantly. Excellent, easy recipe.

Very tasty sweet.  Makes a nice half batch too.  The next time I make them I'm going to try milk chocolate chips vs semi sweet.  Not a fan of the bitter chip.

Definitely pre bake the graham cracker crust at least 5 minutes before you put in the filling. These were delicious, but no one wanted to try them because they were so gooey and nasty looking!

I've made this several times because it's such a quick, easy and tasty dessert.  I've played around with the crust a bit- usually use a bit less sugar as well as less butter.  Haven't quite mastered it but I don't like when it's really wet.

This was a great, easy and fast recipe, my kids all loved it and keep asking me to make more.  I had to substitute butter cookies for graham crackers for the top crust (ran out of Graham Crackers) but it still turned out great......

Yum Yum Yum!!!  I knew these would be fantastic when I tasted the crust alone and it was so tasty!  I made them for a family get together and there were none leftover!  Definitely will make again!  Hmmm - maybe with PB or butterscotch chips!

i made these for a party (the night before so they would be plenty cool, in accordance to all other reviews on how bad they are warm), and they were quite a hit. i cut them into smallish squares for easier eatablility. i only had big marshmallows, so cut them in half and layered them like that... next time i'll get mini marshmallows b/c it came out a little too chocolatey (but it's not like anyone will complain about too much chocolate!).

Good, satisfied my craving for s'mores.  but I found the top too messy, maybe I put too much crumbs..  I don't know.  But I liked them.

This is the only way to eat S'mores!  I put them in the freezer for about 5 min. before cutting and taking out of the pan.

THIS WAS QUICK FUN AND YUMMY!!!!!!! I made this while my friends were in the other room and whipped up so FAST.  I had to improvise, I used hershey bars in a single layer( 6 bars in all) than large marshmallows on top.  baked for 15 minutes, I will always make it like this and right from the oven to the table.  thanks for sharing, EVERYONE left with the recipe and will make again

It was really yummy. one big suggestion, take out the sugar completely!!!! you don't need that!! and make sure you use semi-sweet choc chip.and I also added almost one more cup of cracker. It was soft and delicious. I'll make it again.

Fantastic…so yummy! Nobody could resist these! This was a perfect “cheer me up, summer is coming” type treat for the middle of winter! These are all the goodness of a true s’more made over a camp fire wrapped into neat little bars!

i was so excited to make this, i had been craving s'mores for months. didn't think my landlord would appreciate a fire in the backyard, so this was a recipe to try. it is good if you like really, and i mean SUPER sweet deserts.  i didn't put any sugar in the graham crackers, because i was afraid it would be too sweet and it was still too much for me. i did however, buy milk choc chips by accident, so that might be why. good thing is, i drank a week's worth of milk with one serving!  it is pretty sloppy too, best to eat with plate/fork. might make again, probably for sugar-greedy kids! thanks for sharing.

I left out the sugar in the "crust"... and it doesn't really stay together.  I will have to serve them with a fork, definitely not finger food!  But they were super easy and taste pretty good.  This is a good one to let kids help make!  We will probably try again using whole graham crackers!

I liked this, but most of my family didn't; but then again they aren't huge s'more fans.  I made it as written except I put it in an 8X11.5 pan.  I used a little less butter with the graham crumbs and I didn't need quite as many chocolate chips and marshmallows.

Not a fan of this recipe...I thought there was too little chocolate for how many graham cracker crumbs there were. It was pretty bland, also. Maybe my expectations were too high considering it's just a deconstructed s'mores...maybe I thought it would taste more decadent. I think kids would enjoy this recipe though. I didn't care for it. My husband didn't hate it but didn't love it either. My shih tzu, Finley, loved them though! lol

Kind of gross. Maybe it was the texture? Idk but the kids didn’t even finish it. I’ll stick with camp fire s’mores.

This will be my go-to dessert for potlucks!  So easy and everyone loved it!  I cooked it longer than 10 minutes because I had used regular marshmallows and broken up Hershey bars.  Great recipe for a classic fave!

These were very delicious but were too buttery. I made them a second time and only used a stick of butter (a half of a cup) and they turned out to be so much better.  No need to butter the pan.

Next time i may try less butter and less chocolates.   Very very greasy and messy.  Didn't really enjoy as I had hoped.

I'm sure it was just me, but the crust didn't hold together at all. I tried the suggestion to bake it for 5 minutes first, then I layered the chocolate (I only had chocolate bars so used those) and after they melted I added the marshmallows and baked again but had to turn the broiler on to brown them. The crust was crumbly and over dark. A disappointment. A friend suggested adding an egg to the crust, if I make it again i will do that an also use chocolate chips instead of the bars which did not melt well.

They are so delicious!!! I'm super tempted to eat the whole pan! They're pretty simple to make, and a decent alternative to s'mores over a campfire (although nothing s'more related could match actual s'mores over a campfire). I will definitely make this again!

We all loved these. Of course they are very sweet and super fattening! I am not sure what other reviewers expect - it is butter, chocolate chips and marshmallows for heavens sake! I tweaked it a tiny bit by adding peanut butter chips to it as well!!!!  LOVED, LOVED, LOVED!

I wish I knew what causes the chocolate/marshmallow layer not to stick to the bottom crust.  I have made these several times and that is what they always do.  Any ideas?  Other than that....fantabulous!

These were delicious and a huge hit in my daughter's class. I reduced the butter and increased the graham crackers as others suggested. Also cooked the crust for 7 min before topping with marshmallows and chocolate. I did line my pan with tin foil and cooled for a couple hours before cutting. They turned out great.

Made these for a family party/weiner roast, and they were a hit! Not a crumb left! Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe.
