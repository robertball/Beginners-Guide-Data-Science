I fixed this recipe twice. The first was dry and ran over in the oven. The second time I used a 3 quart casserole and covered it and baked for 40 minutes, uncovered and baked 10 minutes longer until the top was browned. It turned out very well and was excellent. I also used cinamon raison bread. It is now in my recipe file.

This is soooooo good! We ate half and I gave half to our own AVON! I added 1 extra cup of diced rhubard and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts. It bakes up beautifully. A MUST make again recipe. Served warm with Cool Whip (non-dairy) Topping. This is melt in your mouth good!

Perfect!  Not too sweet and a great way to use some of our fresh eggs (we always have too many!)  I did use regular sugar but only 1 c.

This was quite dry, bland, and just eggy.  I've made bread pudding before, and this recipe was quite a let down in comparison.

EXCELLENT - I used regular sugar though, an equivalent amount to the Splenda.  The second time I made it, I put the rhubarb right in with the bread, then mixed the remaining ingredients in a bowl, skipping the part there you heat the milk and butter.  It was even better than the first!!  I am all about simple!
