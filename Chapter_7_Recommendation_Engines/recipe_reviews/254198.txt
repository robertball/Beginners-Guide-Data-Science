This was the second time in my life to eat mulberries and while I thought they were just ok on their own I really loved them in this cake! The ingredients were simple enough that I was able to put it together at 9:00 p.m. in my little kitchen in China (though I did have to ask a neighbor for an egg!)

This is delicious which is a good thing considering that I had to make a quadruple recipe after accidentally putting in too much oil! I used almond meal for a little of the flour and coconut oil for the oil. I used half the salt but next time I'll probably leave that out completely. I only made half the amount of crumb topping it called for and that was still plenty. I discovered that sour milk works just fine in this recipe. Next time I might add some grated coconut to the topping. This cake is not as sweet as some and with the smaller amount of topping I think it would make good muffins.

The crumble top was too much sugar. I will try it again next year when my tree fruits again.

This is a delightful coffee cake and a great way to use mulberries if you don't have a lot. It's definitely more of a cake than a crisp, so you taste more cake in each bite than fruit. My berries weren't particularly flavorful, so the sugar topping helped a lot. It reminded me of a blueberry/marrionberry taste once cooked. I will certainly make this again!

This was so easy and soo soo good! The whole family loved this! I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand so I used 2 tbsps of applesauce instead. Also I didn't use all of the topping mix on my cake because I wasn't sure how it would bake up but I think it was fine with just a light layer (put enough so I didn't see any cake mix/berries peeking through). Also what little cake that was left almost tasted better the next day! Definitely making this one again!

The new home we bought has a mulberry tree planted in the back and of course I needed to make something with the amazing berries it has been producing. This recipe was incredibly simple and tastes just as good as it looks. I followed it to a tee and will definitely be repeating in the future!

Husband LOVED it. I thought it was WAY too sweet. The crumb topping needs more butter to be more crumby I think. If I make this again I will cut the sugar in half at least or maybe just remove the white sugar from the crumb topping.

I made this gluten free for my sister the only change to the recipe I made was I replaced the flour with an equal amount of gf flour. It cooked up great and my sister loved it. I wish I would have remembered to take a picture but it got eaten up too quickly!

My daughter just bought a piece of property with a mulberry tree and has been giving me mulberries. I've never eaten them so when I found this recipe I decided to try it. I followed the recipe exactly no substitutions. My husband and I went back for seconds while the cake was still warm! It was absolutely delicious and as long as this tree produces mulberries I'll be making this lovely little cake??

I added a little more berries and I used raspberries and mulberries.

Would definitely make again! I did pulse my mulberries in the food processor like 3 times before sprinkling them on top. Reduced sugar by 25% (but I do that for almost every recipe I make). Added the zest of 2 limes (most of which went into the batter but some sprinkled with a little sugar over the mulberry layer). Doubled the recipe and made in a 9x13 which baked through in about 25 minutes (my oven runs a little hot).
