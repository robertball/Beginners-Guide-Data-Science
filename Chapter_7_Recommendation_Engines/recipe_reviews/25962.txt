My aunt makes the best homemade blackberry preserves.  I use her jam to make my jam cakes.  But this recipe will definitely be used again.  I took it to work and it went quickly.  Thank you

I like that the chocolate is subtle.  The blackberry was also subtle and I wish that flavor had come out more - that's one reason I picked the recipe.  It was OK but nothing really exciting.  I think I'd probably prefer like a spice cake or something.  I did not use any frosting at all because I don't like super sweet things and the cake is enough.  (And I don't think caramel would have been very good.)

Just made this recipe and it's out of this world!  Moist and delicious!  It will be one I make over and over again!  I too use the berry fusion by jello and it's awesome!

Great recipe!  I used blueberry preserves in the place of blackberry and iced it with Caramel Frosting III- delicious!

I baked the cake in miniature springform pans (reduced baking time to 35-40 minutes), and it worked very nicely.

This is a very moist and tasty cake. I didn't really notice the chocolate flavor so much. I used homemade blackberry jam I made earlier this summer. I did notice the larger pieces of fruit in the jam did migrate to the bottom, but the cake itself took on a slightly purple hue from the preserves. One negative for me was that the cake didn't rise in the center. I'm not sure if this was due to the amount of mixing to incorporate all of the ingredients. I did make half the recipe and baked it in an 8" square pan. It tested done at 40 minutes despite the sunken center. I topped this with Caramel Frosting III.

Nice light, chocolate flavor to the cake and moist.  When I made it the jam settled to the bottom while baking.  Does anyone have any ideas for preventing that?  Next time I make it I'll also try adding a half teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg to the batter.

I used 1 cup of orange marmalade instead of the blackberry jam.  Turned out Delicious.  It did sink in the middle as someone else mentioned.

Did not care for the flavor. It tasted rather odd, especially with the caramel frosting. Will not make again.
