I was looking around for a new cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving Day, and I made a smaller version of this one.  This one is good and definitely easy.  I think this will take a backseat to another one that I've tried, but this will definitely be used on those delicious sandwiches that we'll enjoy after Thanksgiving! Thanks, DebAnn!
