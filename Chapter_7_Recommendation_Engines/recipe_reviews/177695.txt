I loved this! I used fresh carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, and frozen corn and used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  Both my husband and I loved it! I also added some celery salt, garlic powder, and paprika- a couple shakes of each.  SO good! And you can adjust it to whatever you like! Yum yum.

Very easy and good. Instead of making biscuit I put every thing in a cassarole dish and poured bisquick mix over it and baked it for 35 min. Once you do that it is the same recipe that is on the back of the bisquick box. Will be making again

It's been a while since I have made this, but I remember this one well--works really well with leftover chicken or a rotisserie chicken if you're in a hurry!!  I used some cream of chicken and some cream of mushroom soup though, but all in all this basic recipe is pretty good!

Loved this recipe! I changed it up quite a bit, but the convenience of not having to use pie crust was awesome! I cheated and bought a Rotisserie chicken from Costco, combined it with 3 cans of cream of broccoli soup, chopped carrots, frozen peas, frozen cut broccoli, boiled potatoes, and onion. I would suggest adding a chicken bouillion cube for some added flavor, and maybe some garlic as well. Overall, we LOVED this recipe, and it's being added to our dinner rotation menu!!

This was simple to make and really fast. We added an extra can of the cream soup because it seemed kinda dry and it turned out nice and creamy. Great for a hectic night.

I really want to like this recipe, but found it very lacking. I think that fresh vegetables would help a great deal and that seasoning and chicken broth are absolutely necessary! The condensed soup does not provide enough moisture for the chicken/veggie combo to "simmer". It is my fault for using poor quality biscuits, which did not help matters. Though this is easy, it needs lots of improvement in order to be tasty.

This was delicious!  My 4-year-old daughter (who doesn't normally comment on my food) said "Mommy, this is delicious". :)  I did add some Italian seasoning and black pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Very good, very easy, very quick meal!

I thought this recipe was really easy, delicious and is great for leftovers! I used frozen veggies, but when I make this again I think I will use fresh veggies and cook them before adding them to the cream of chicken. I did add about a canful of water to the cream of chicken, and I'm glad I did this because it helped add more liquid but didn't take away from the taste. I cut the biscuits in half and served them open faced, with the chicken mixture served on top. Delish!

Loved this recipe! So easy, quick, and cheap to make! I used the stew blend of veggies, and the cream of chicken soup with herbs.  Using this kind of soup added the perfect amount flavoring!  Love how incredibly easy this is!

This was such an EASY and delicious recipe!  I had leftover shredded chicken and just used that.  I did boil the vegetables for about 15 minutes before adding the cream of chicken because I like them to be very tender.  I also used 2 cans of soup instead of just one and added a spoon of sour cream and a splash of milk just to make the mixture more liquidy and creamy.  I seasoned with salt & pepper.  And I cut the biscuits in half and served them open-faced as well. It was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe and used frozen peas corn and carrots instead of broccoli and cauliflower. I added a bit of Italian seasoning but otherwise left the recipe alone. It tasted simple but great and I have requests to make it again soon. Amy

This was delicious, but I used homemade garlic cheese biscuits instead of regular biscuits. It added just enough flavor to make my husband ask what the secret ingredient was. :)

Loved how easy this recipe is!!  I doubled everything to make sure I had plenty.  I cooked the chicken with garlic, pepper, Johnny's Seasoning Salt, and Italian seasoning.  I added ~1 cup of chicken broth to the mix because I was afraid the condensed soup alone might be too sticky/thick.  Was a hit with everyone who ate it.

This was good, my fiance' really enjoyed this. Not quite the same as an actual chicken pot pie but an easier alternative. I topped this dish with some French's crispy onions in cheddar flavor to add a little crunch.

This turned out good. I did add chicken rub seasoning to the chicken while browning it, added salt, pepper, garlic power and a few more veggies. I am still a bigger fan of the "Original Pot Pie".

Very Quick and Easy. Toss some seasonings in there see what happens each time ya make this. Its hard to overpower all the cream of chicken soup.  I threw in some garlic powder, onion powder, some pepper and called it a day. Tasted great for 20 minutes meal.

I cooked the biscuits on top of the whole thing in a casserole dish. It turned out great!! I also didn't use a bag a frozen vegetables. I boiled sliced carrots, potatoes, and onion in pot of water and chicken Boyon. Then mixed them with the soup and chicken i used some of the flavored water to thin it down. The extra flavor was great.

I used green beans, corn, and carrots instead of a mixed veggie combo.  I thought the soup was a bit thick & it seemed to be missing something...

Quick and easy dinner that my kids (and husband) love. Made with fresh vegetables, boiled first to soften them, and then mixed in the soup and chicken. Voila. Used low fat soup and low fat biscuits to try to cut the fat...

I too made some changes: half a turkey breast (instead of chicken), 2 cans of cream of celery soup (instead of cream of chicken), 2 cups vegetable stock to thin, changed the veggies to green beans, baby carrots, and corn, 1 cup caramelized onions, ground pepper, italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika and left the bread/bisects on the side for dipping! This was my forth time making it and it came our delicious!!!  ***Don't add any salt until you try it. We felt cans of soup have enough themselves!

Quick and easy!! Didn't have the soup so I substituted chicken gravy with chicken broth. Turned out just as well as the original, except a little salty due to chicken gravy.

Being a diabetic this recipe was low carb for me. Instead of using biscuits though I used crescent rolls. Those have less carbs then biscuits plus taste better to me. I too used 2 cans of the soup. Next time I may add french fried onions to the top and bake it.

Very good base recipe that requires some tweaking depending upon your individual taste. I used 2 cans of the regular condensed cream of chicken soup, added thinly sliced carrots, peas and corn and a little chopped onion and about 1 1/2 tsp celery salt. I also added a little chicken broth to thin the mixture.  It was a hit!!!

Both my boyfriend and I love traditional chicken pot pie, but were looking for an option that we could make with less calories and fat.  We found this deconstructed pot pie recipe and decided to give it a try.  We used the lower fat version of the soup and frozen stew vegetables.  We cooked the chicken in chicken broth versus oil and added garlic and onions to the skillet.  Based on other reviews, we knew to add some spice.  It turned out good, but could have used some additional spice.  I also should have added some broccoli or cauliflower to the recipe.   All in all, a good dish that I will try again.

Made this for dinner and it was so quick and good!  I basically followed as written; however, I had an extra quarter cup chicken soup that I wantd to use up.  I also added in some pepper, chopped onion, and parsley.  I served the biscuits on the side and added some cheese to the top of mine.  It was a great recipe that did not need a lot of prep or time.  Definitely a go to recipe.

I love this quick, easy and inexpensive meal. I, like other reviewers add garlic and onion powder and a little dried parsley to the soup mixture with about a 1/2 can of milk to pep it up and make it saucier. Great with Pillsbury Grands buttery layers biscuits.

I followed the directions, but added another can of soup.  I omitted the broccoli, but added canned corn, peas and carrots.  I also found it a bit bland, so added a bit of parsley, celery salt, and onion powder.  I didn't have biscuits, so I used flaky pastry puffs.  I halved the puffs, poured the mixture on top of it and put in the oven at 350 F for 15 minutes (covered with foil to avoid drying up).  It was yummy!

Everyone loved this.  I marinated the  chicken with some garlic powder and soy sauce for 1/2 hour before.  Will make this again.

This recipe was great ! Quick & easy although I switched some things a bit. I added garlic salt & pepper when I sautéed the chicken & then I used a can of cream of chicken along with a can of cream of mushroom. Put it all baking dish & topped everything with buisquik to make a crust on top . Baked it at 350 for about 40 mins or until it's nice & golden brown on top. Came out delicious .

It's a great idea, but the consistency is nothing like chicken pot pie. So, instead, I made my own as if it where going into a pie crust and put that over biscuits. Now, THAT was delicious. But, thank you for the idea. I also used potatoes, corn, green beans, carrots, etc for veggies. This recipe is so much better when it's authentic.

This recipe was nice to try and was very simple, but it left me wanting more flavor and wishing that I had just made chicken pot pies. Now don't get me wrong, it was so simple I still had to give it a shot but much better just to go the extra steps and even maybe just use a pre made pie crust for real pot pies. First of all there was barely any seasoning. So I added onion and garlic powder with some extra salt and pepper while cooking the chicken and after adding the veggies because it was so bland without. The other thing I ended up doing was adding chicken broth because the soup was not enough creaminess for even a fake pot pie. At least there is a simple thing to make if I need to go down this road again but unless I get desperate, I will not be making this again. Oh well, thanks for the thought!

I made this last night for the first time. I doubled the recipe as I was cooking for a pot luck. I used 3 cans of Cream of Chicken soup and a can and a half of milk and added 2 Knorr Chicken Bouillon cubes. It was a hit!! Next time though, I think I'll use Mary B's frozen biscuits instead of Pillsbury tube biscuits, as they are heartier. Overall, excellent recipe. Made the MaryB's biscuits. MUCH BETTER.

This was a good idea. I did change the veggies though. I steamed fresh baby carrots, green beans and used mushrooms. I also caramelized 1/2 chipped brown onion with garlic and one tsp of butter and let that all marinate BEFORE adding the chicken in last with the soup. Also added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and the flavor was awesome! I believe it tastes better with FRESH veggie as opposed to canned. Definitely going to make this again.

I used cream of mushroom with garlic because I read on some of the reviews that it was bland. It was OK. It was fast and easy. But i did forget the biscuits. i will try it again with biscuits and a different kind on condensed soup. I think it is a good base recipe that can easily be altered.

This was great!! I made some minor changes and loved it - definitely a do again.
I used two cans of soup, per other commentors' advice - Cream of Chicken and Cream of Potato. I also threw in about 1/2cup half-n-half to make it creamier (I only did this because I have some on hand and don't want it to go to waste). 
I also used a bag of regular mixed veggies and added an extra cup of green beans. I seasoned with garlic salt and pepper. 
This was reallllly yummy!
