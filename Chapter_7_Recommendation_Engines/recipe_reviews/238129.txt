I thought this would be too sweet with the margarita mix and the schnapps, but it's not at all!  I really like this combination!  Right after I took my photo, though, I got rid of the ice!  I prefer my drinks like this straight up.  Thanks, klynn21!  I'll be making this one again!  It's a great summer drink!
