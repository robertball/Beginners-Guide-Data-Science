Hubs hurt my feelings tonight. In between mouthfuls of chili he said, "This is the best chili you've ever made." Hmf! MY chili, I thought, was the best!  I made a few changes, all of them minor, but the one big change I HAD to make was to add more tomato sauce. I made 1/2 the recipe and, using the amount of tomatoes and tomato sauce called for, I had something that almost resembled the consistency of a casserole! So for this 1/2 recipe I had to add 4 more cups of tomato sauce (used my own, which I had put up from my garden). I would  call this quite a discrepancy! Even accepting that individual preferences dictate how thick or thin chili should be, until I "fixed" this it was something you could have eaten with a fork! I can't offer my own review of this, since I am not a fan of chili in the first place, so I would probably not like it no matter what. But hubs said he loved it, said it was "4 star and darn near a 5." For the 1/2 recipe I used the full can of black beans rather than a half can - and I certainly wouldn't call it too "beany." I used more fresh garlic than called for and left out the garlic powder. Finally, I had orange, yellow and red peppers on hand, so used them rather than the green pepper. I thought the addition of rosemary unusual - I could really taste it and didn't like it, personally. I don't think it belongs in chili. But hubs even had a second big bowl of this and instructed me, enthusiastically, to make it again. Looks like "my" chili is history.

I needed an additional 15oz can of tomato sauce and also added some Franks Red Hot.  Hubby loved it, so all is good!  Thanks for sharing!

Remove bay leaf b4 serving. Add more liquid. Skip the rosemary. Included something spicy. Otherwise, a good, basic chili. I followed the recipe as written, w/ the exception of browning the meat w/ the onions, bell peppers, and 3 minced garlic cloves. Also, the consistency in the crock pot was like mega-chunky-pasta-sauce, so I upgraded the 8 oz. can tomato sauce to a 15 oz., as well as an additional 1/2 can of water. I couldn't help but omit the rosemary though, I'm sorry Kas, but I couldn't bring myself to put rosemary in chili. Otherwise, all the other spices and herbs remained in the ratio written. Served our's w/ additional cilantro, green onion, cheese, and fritos, but everyone at the table was grabbing for Sriracha, Texas Pete, and jalapenos to add some oomph. I think this chili's leftovers would be good for festooning a baked potato or a hot dog, and I think I'd be happy to make it again.

This was my first attempt at making chili, and after browsing through several recipe's I settled on this one; based primarily on the ingredients and the fact that it was a "slow cooker" version. Well it turned out great! Thick and flavorful. My personal spin on the recipe included no rosemary, smoked paprika instead of regular, carne picada instead of ground beef and I added 1 pepper from a can of La Costena brand, chipotle in adobo sauce.

We really enjoy this nice, thick and chunky chili.  The first time I made it, I made as written.  It was delicious, but we wanted some "heat".  When I made it a second time, I added hot chili beans and a diced jalapeño.  The peppers and diced tomatoes add a great texture to this chili.  An added bonus is that this freezes and reheats really well.  A dish that will be repeated often.

This was awesome, my husband who does not like chili actually really liked it. The only change I made to the recipe was to put in 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of one and this, just because of previous reviews knowing that it would be in the oven all afternoon and I wouldn't be able to check on it. I left out the cilantro, I really don't like it in anything... I made it in the oven because the recipe was too much for my slow cooker, 250 for 6 hours.

This was a good mild chili.  We tend to like things a little spicier, but still enjoyed it.

I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes (my husband doesn't like the texture of diced) and ground turkey instead of beef (it's what I had on hand).  I also drained and rinsed the black beans.  I browned the meat, drained off the fat, and then threw everything together in the slow cooker.  I did high for 30 minutes and then low for 5 1/2 hours.

Excellent recipient. You can adjust this as you see fit with more or less seasonings.  For me I added one more 15oz can of tomato sauce cause it seems a little lacking in liquid. It might have been because I used a little more than 2lbs of meat. Also: this is a huge amount of chili. I couldn’t fit all the ingredients into my 6 qt Instant Pot so I had to make it on my range which was fine. Just FYI out there. You could cut this recipe in half and have a serving enough for 4-8 easily.

This  chili was delicious! I made a few changes with some of the seasoning and left out a few things.  I simmered at low heat for about 1 hour. Turned out great!

Very easy and delicious chili.  I made an entire batch of it for a potluck and there was a cup left.  I call that a success.  I subbed ground turkey for beef, and it's a good thing I did, as we have people in our office who don't eat beef or pork.  I think I left out the rosemary (not sure!) and used canned tomatoes that had oregano, rosemary and basil in them.  Not really by design; it was just what was on sale at the store.  In mixing this up, I noticed what other reviewers remarked in that this is really chunky without much liquid.  I ended up adding a very large can of tomato sauce equaling probably a bit over 30 oz as well as a jar of salsa, and I'm glad I did or it would not have had enough liquid.  Thanks for the recipe!

I waited too long to start this, so I made it on the stovetop instead of in the slow cooker. I like larger pieces of meat, so I diced a 2 lb. London broil and browned it in a little oil (also, no draining means you don't lose the meat juices). I also used the larger can of tomato sauce, since stovetop cooking meant I was likely to cook off more liquid. The combination of spices is really what makes this chili better, though, so despite my substitutions I will say that this is a great recipe!

Good recipe.  I added only a small amount of onion (tummy issues), and added in celery instead.   Near the end of the cook time, I added another small can of tomato sauce,  my preference for chili consistency.   I did add more spices near the end of the cooking time as well after tasting the near final product.  I used Rotel canned tomatoes with green peppers and onions, next time I will use just regular tomatoes.  I served it with tortilla chips, sour cream, shredded cheddar and cilantro.

Love this chili! It's a basically great recipe. I have made many versions of it. I ususally use fire roasted tomatoes and add a can of preseasoned chili beans or something like beans with garlic and onion. I also don't use as much chili powder, it can be too spicy for our tastes. I also add a can of corn. Sometimes I use ground turkey instead of beef. If I do that I always add a bunch of spices to the turkey as I am browning. I also brown the meat with onion and garlic. It's ALWAYS a family and crowd pleaser!
