As good as the Lady says, I dont use the salt and sometimes replace the nutmeg with 60ml of dark rum at stage 2, but with or without the rum this recipe is excellent.

This is so quick and easy to make, but it tastes delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time is to use brown sugar. Other than that, this is excellent. I served this with a little fat-free Cool Whip. Thanks!

These are a great dessert if you need something fast and delicious. The only recommendation I have is to maybe half (or even quarter) the recipe (unless you have a LOT of company over) because it doesn't keep well AT ALL.

This was very yummy!  Next time I think I'll cut up the bananas so they get a bit softer.  I'd also use brown sugar instead of white.  My husband thinks it would taste better with a bit of rum extract.  It was still very good, though.

What an absolutely wonderful recipe this was.  I will make it again and again.  Thanks so much for posting.  One note though....Make only what you need because the banana's dont keep till the next day.

These were really really good, but I thought they were lacking a little something. Chopped nuts? Drizzled chocolate? I added rum to the sauce, and that was an excellent plan!

This was just okay. I do not think I would like it by itself, but it was all right with ice cream. A dessert like this, I think, would be better with apples than bananas. Thanks anyway.

Very good. I had a few extra bananas laying around so I thought I would give it a try. I used the vanilla crepe recipe with it . Not to sweet just right. I will make again.

Don't worry about how this dish looks, it tastes great.  Could use less sugar and it would still be very good.  Great way to use ripe bananas.

I didn't care for this at all.  I love bananas foster and was hoping this would be similar.  My bananas turned out a little bitter after cooking and the syrup topping was just a thin clear sugar syrup.  I think it would taste much better with brown sugar so you could get that carmel taste.  
I even put this over ice cream and topped it with whipped cream.  I think I would have preferred just the ice cream and whip cream without the bananas.  Sorry.
