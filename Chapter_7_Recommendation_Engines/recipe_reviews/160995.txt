What a nice, lively, spring dish to accompany salmon cakes for lunch.  The only change I would suggest is to use fresh tarragon, which enhances the delicate flavor beautifully.  Thank you Jill815!

Awesome! I did grill 2 huge bunches of pencil thin asparagus and made the dressing (tripled it) on the side. When the asparagus was done, I tossed it with the dressing....everyone loved it! The dijon, tarragon, shallots, etc...delicious...will make again!

Hubs and I both enjoyed this lovely and different, piquant dressing.  Very richly flavored, and really dresses up the asparagus. Great blend of flavors that resemble Bearnaise sauce.  I wasn't real crazy about the asparagus broiled, but Hubs loved it.  All and all, a memorable and elegant vegetable side dish.

This is really nice, tangy & light. I used about 1/4 of a red onion instead of shallot. The dressing is enough to coat the asparagus if tossed, but not really enough to "pour over" - which was fine. Thanks! I'll make this again. N*

Boy ate these up faster than I could say what kind of sauce dressed these asparagus - high praise for a green vegetable in this household.  Delicious and simple!  Make sure you truly coat each stalk in oil, rather than just drizzle.  Drizzling results in crispy bits in places and mushy bits in others, which isn't all that spectacular.

This recipe makes my whole family want to eat their veggies!  Substitutes are a breeze... especially with changing up the herbal component. 

I substituted rosemary for the tarragon for a slightly different --but just as yummy-- flavor. 

I also made this with green beans, adding whole cherry tomatoes & toasted almonds (Sprinkle toasted sliced almonds over veggies at the end. The cherry tomatoes should cook in the oven until they start to wrinkle)

Either way, this lemon-based dressing is delicious & beyond easy!

I really liked this!  I had never used tarragon before, so I was a little hesitant, but it came out tasting quite yummy.  Thanks for a new way to make asparagus. N*R

We loved it! My 3yo daughter munched them like they were licorice. The family was about evenly split on the dressing, so feel free to try the recipe without it. I also tried grilling the asparagus and it was awesome. Definitely doing this one again.

Very good! The dressing is light and tangy and compliments the broiled asparagus nicely.  This came together really quickly, and is a pretty healthy way to dress up asparagus.  Think I might have used more lemon juice than what was called for, but it's a very flexible recipe.  Thanks for sharing! N*R

Outstanding...thank you for the opportunity to shine with your recipe.  I wanted more, more, more.  (I did add a little more mustard but that was my personal choice.)  This is a  10.

Somewhat torn over this.  I loved the dressing...just not on the asparagus.  For me, there was an overwhelming lemon flavor that I wasn't crazy about.  If I were to use the dressing on the asparagus I'd probably up the olive oil, lessen the lemon and maybe add some honey to give it a little more sweetness.

This was a nice change of pace for asparagus.  I steamed them instead of broiling (just because my oven was being used for something else), and they were quite good.  The flavor of the sauce was unique and tasty.  I eyeballed the ingredients and used a little too much lemon juice, so it was tangier than it should have been but still very good overall.  Next time I will broil and measure!  :)

I slightly over-broiled the asparagus, but it still came out really good.

Quick and easy side dish that's really good! We love asparagus and this was a nice way to dress it up a bit. The dressing wasn't overpowering and it gave it a nice creaminess with a bit of tanginess. Overall, very tasty!

Really tasty! Instead of putting the shallots in the dressing, I mix them in with the asparagus and oil before I broil it.

This was a pleasant combination of flavors.  I did over cook my asparagus though...  Also alot of the shallots ended up just on the bottom of my serving dish and not being eaten.  N*R

Usually I can take or leave asparagus, but I made this for company with the dressing on the side-in case they were purists. This was the best asparagus I've ever tasted! Washed, dried, broke the stalks where they bent. Broiling is the only way I'll do them now. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

This recipe is also good without the dressing using oil, salt and pepper.  The dressing does give it a savory taste but asparagus is good on its own.

I submitted this recipe. I'm not real sure why the asparagus ingredient shopping list uses CANNED asparagus or when it was added, but I'm not real happy about it.  I have never used anything, or do I recommend anything but FRESH asparagus.
