I thought this was good, but I missed the lettuce.  Next time I will use this as a topping on a bed of lettuce, and it will be perfect.

I've made it a couple of times. I'm not fond of onions so I left them out the second time.  The sweetness of the peas is great with the crunch of the celery and bacon. I added another teaspoon of salad dressing mix the second time.  TIP:  I tossed the half frozen peas in because I was late for a potluck. It kept the mixture cold until I got there. A friend suggested I add roasted peanuts next time.

Made it for a potluck and had to give the recipe to everyone there. I did quarter the tomatoes to make them alittle easier to eat. Also added a little mayo to the sour cream.

What do you do with a box of peas and some leftover cooked bacon? Make this salad! Not content to leave well enough alone, I made a few changes. Didn't have grape tomatoes - used a chopped, seeded tomato instead. Added crushed garlic, dill, extra ranch powder, a bit of cayenne pepper and a splash of red wine vinegar. I also threw in a few tablespoons of mayo and used half cheddar, half bleu cheese. Yummy!

Thanks for sharing. For those of you who think its a little bland add an extra tsp of ranch seasoning. I like to put this on a bed of lettuce, no dressing needed. Also very great for the brown bag lunch, just keep the luttuce seperate until ready to eat. You can also use 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream and toss with cooked pasta of your choice and you have a wonderful Bacon Ranch Suddenly Salad. Wonderful recipe thanks again for sharing.

People at the picnic I took this salad to raved about it. I liked this recipe but I wished I had cooked the peas and not merely thawed them.  

The salad was better the longer it sat in the fridge but it was absolutely BEST when I stirred the remainder into store bought potato salad.  I don't think I will ever make potato salad any other way again.

Love this salad so much that I made it again just so I could take a photo and submit it...now viewers can see how delicious it is.  The only thing I did different is add the bacon at the last minute, so it stays crisp!

I added a little more ranch mix than called for.  Excellent recipe.

I was surprised by how much I like this recipe. Also, surprised that I'd never thought of this myself. Everything I love about traditional 7 layer salad, simplified, and ready to serve in just an hour. Brilliant. I add hard boiled eggs, and cashews to mine. Sometimes, I miss the iceberg lettuce, so I use this as a topping to lettuce.

This was not my favorite "layered salad", but it was certainly alot quicker to put together.  I increased the ranch seasoning considerably, but still never got the flavor I was looking for, even after letting it chill for about 20 hours.  I served it on a bed of iceberg lettuce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, triplesec!

This was very, very yummy!  I added chopped brocolli instead of the tomatoes, and I used purple onion instead of green onion.  I also added a little more of the salad dressing powder.
I will definitely make again. Thanx.

I have a similar recipe. I use yogurt (mixed with a little cottage cheese for texture), and a sprinkling of dill and/or basil.

I did add the whole envelope of ranch dressing so I wouldn't have left overs, and I think it made it better.  I didn't miss the lettuce of the original.  Have made several times. (for myself I leave the bacon off)

Four stars because I added lettuce. The recipe is great and I followed along until I realized that maybe there wouldn't be enough... so then I started... avocado, red leaf lettuce, eggs, no celery (I don't like celery!)... it basically turned into a garbage salad and after the event... there was none left!!! So much for lunch the next day!!!

really good!  I didnt have any bacon or celery so I added some grated carrots and bell pepper for crunch.  It needed more seasoning which i added and all was good.   Also, my peas were a bit frozen when i combined ingredients but within an hour the dish was ready to eat in time for dinner.

Yum! This is a cool, crisp salad. I did take the advice of others and made the following changes: used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/3 cup of mayo., used about 2 1/2 tsp of ranch dressing, added cucumbers (because I think there was too much dressing) also added 3 chopped hard boiled eggs. So yummy and a great prepare-ahead dish.  Look forward to trying it with pasta.  A keeper for sure!

This was as good or better than the traditional seven-layer salad and so much easier.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it on shredded iceberg lettuce.  You could also add shredded carrots or any other vegetables of your choosing.  Will be making this often.
