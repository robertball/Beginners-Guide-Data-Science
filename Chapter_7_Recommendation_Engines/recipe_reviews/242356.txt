Careful, these are addicting! They have a delicious, savory, eggy texture that makes you want to keep eating them. I'm not sensitive to gluten, but these sounded interesting and I had all the ingredients so I whipped up a batch. The only slight thing I did different was to use fat-free cheddar.  I was trying to split the batter between 12 muffin cups, but I only ended up with 10. They are on the small side, but don't let their size fool you - they are PACKED with flavor and satisfy any carb or salty craving. These will make a nice addition to my weekday breakfasts, paired with my eggs and veggies. I also love that they are low-carb. Thank you Angela for the fabulous recipe!

Need more cheese couldn’t taste it. But it did not have much of a taste.
