Great taste! Couldn't be bothered with the multi-step directions, so I omitted the oil and threw everything except the yam and flour into a pot, and turned it on. I let it cook about 40 minutes then mixed the flour with some reserved broth, added it and the yams to the pot, and cooked it another 20 minutes. Substituted zucchini for the green pepper (just what I had on hand) and added the hot sauce over each plate at the end, for individual taste. Served over rice, and it turned out great without all the work!

I don't know if I like this soup more for the flavor or the color - it's almost too pretty to eat.  *Almost.*  Ha.  I couldn't find spicy turkey sausage, but I did find regular and it tasted fine.  I also used chicken thighs instead of turkey because I wrote down chicken thighs on my grocery list by mistake.  Whoops!  Anyway, I only added 1/4 cup flour and had plenty.  The only other change I made was to use two fresh tomatoes, simply for the fact that they were about to go bad just sitting on my counter.  This is a great, comforting soup and I'm just betting it's even better tomorrow.  Plus, like I said, it's really pretty!  Definitely trying it over rice at work for lunch soon - yum!

Easy to make.  I didn't have the turkey sausages so used half a pound of plain pork saugage and 1 1/2 pounds turkey thigh meat.  I used Italian diced tomatoes instead of plain.   This would be good put over rice also.  And I would use more sweet potatoes next time.  Sweet potatoes cooked in ten minutes.  I used sambal ulek rather than hot sauce.

Family loved it!  Wonderful flavor and beautiful to look at too.  I made a few changes based on the fact that I forgot to buy the sausage when I was at the store.  I threw in some leftover bacon, left out the green peppers as kids don't love them, exchanged the canned tomotoes for a small can of tomato paste and added an extra cup of broth to make up the difference in liquid.  Came out beautifully.  I served with homemade yeast rolls.  I will be making this again.

Very nice flavors.  Used chicken, sweet potato, celery, kielbasa, and zucchini.  Cooked the chicken in olive oil.  Then added onion and celery.  Then added the sweet potato, kielbasa and zucchini for the last 20 min or so.  All in the same pot.

Quite bland. All  tasted was the hot sauce and sweet potatoes, everything else was just mush. My toddler wouldn't touch it. My husband couldn't choke it down- although he is quite dramatic. It's a good start! I would use chicken if  made it again..

Good all-around recipe. I used butternut squash instead of the sweet potato and queso poblano chicken sausage. I think it could be spicier! So next time may add a little heat with some cayenne.  I did add more hot sauce but that didn't quite do it. Did serve over rice as others suggested and was a complete meal. Even the kids ate it up! Will try it again.

Amazing!!!  I used an extra hot Italian sausage so I did not need to add any hot sauce.  I did use chicken breast because that's what I had but next time I will definitely use chicken thighs.
