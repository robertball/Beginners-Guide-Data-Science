My parents made this when I was little and now I make this for my family. We also have made it with graham cracker crust and banana pudding for banana cream dessert and have made oreo dessert out of it by making an oreo crust with 1 lb of oreos, crushed and 1/4 c margarine, melted.Press into bottom of pan and let sit until cool before you add other layers. They make good no bake options. It also helps to cool all layers completely before adding next layer. We sometimes stick it in the freezer to speed it along.

I have been making this excellent tasty dessert recipe for years. On occasion I will make two slight changes. When mixing the instant pudding and milk together I add two teaspoons of instant coffee granuals to give it a mocha flavor and use pecans instead of walnuts. Either way you prefer it is always a winner in our family especially for the "chocoholics".

my grandma has been making this for years and it is our family favorite. it is soooo good you'll want to eat the whole pan. we've always topped it with chopped nuts but i like the idea of chocolate shavings on top! i just made two pans yesterday and topped them with fall leaves sprinkles for the thanksgiving holiday.this is the best dessert in the whole world!!! oh and just a tip - don't use skim milk it's too watery and will make your crust soggy - speaking from experience. use at least 2% - thats what i usually use.

I actually got this recipe from a coworker while living in Tennessee and it has been a big hit everytime I make it. When I moved back to CA I lost the recipe and upon searching through All Recipes I stumbled across this one. Cool! I've made this throughout the last several months and is a big hit with everyone that has tried it. I'm asked to make it for our gatherings and just to have when relaxing and doing nothing. I have also passed this onto a couple of friends and now they can't stop making it for their families and associates. The changes I've tried are a thicker crust by adding more flour butter and nuts. I've also increased the size of the pan. I have found that the pudding should be at a consistency where it's creamy so that it makes it easier to spread onto the cream cheese layer. For a larger pan than the recipe calls for I use the large boxes of pudding with a small box and increase the amount of milk dependant on consistency. All in all this will continue to be a big hit and your family and friends will love once you make it.

A big hit for Father's Day but I really could not taste the cream cheese layer. Next time I will double that layer only. Otherwise very good.

I made this dessert last night and I had all of my neighbors over for dessert. Everybody just loved this dessert. It's a winner that I will make often especially in the summer months.

My mom has made this for years -- nothing signifies "home" more than this recipe! She is diabetic so she has tailored it some to her special needs but the changes don't alter the flavor at all only the sugar content. She makes it with sugar-free puddings and sugar free Cool Whip. She also cuts back on the powdered sugar to taste -- usually by about 1/3 to 1/2 less. We use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese (NOT the no-fat -- doesn't work with that one) and don't put the shavings on top. Still good without the shavings. It's also very easy to make and take just about anywhere -- pot lucks holiday dinners I've even requested it instead of a birthday cake when I was younger.

I misplaced my recipe for this...mine was called Four Layer Chocolate Dessert. I made this one and thought it was great. So did my entire family. They started calling it almost better than sex dessert. My ingredients are a little different but both are great. My aunt changed the recipe and used butterscotch pudding and drizzled butterscotch ice cream topping over the top. I liked it better with chocolate and I sprinkle lots of nuts on top. So many variations can be done. I think it is Great! Everyone who has tried it raves over it and asks me for the recipe.

This cake was SOO good. It is great for kids and adults. I loved the walnut crust I would just recomend that the walnuts are chopped as small as possible it makes the crust taste more like a crust rather than just walnuts. The only thing different I would do next time is add more layers....It seems too thin. Everyone of my guests liked it!

My Mom has made this recipe for years and I just love it!!! I have to rate it 4 stars because it ALWAYS seems that it takes me three times as long to back the crust as directed. Who knows...could be my crazy oven. But other than that...fabulous and definitely a crowd pleaser!

This is a fabulous rich decadent dessert that has been a family favorite for years. True it isn't a "cake" with batter but I'm not sure what else you'd call it with its rich chocolate and cream cheese layers on a yummy shortbread crust. At any rate my one tip is that I don't add the decorative chocolate shavings until it's time to serve because after a while they bleed and stain the whipped cream and don't look as nice. Otherwise an easy can't-miss hit for every occasion.

There was just nothing special about this. It was more like just eating chocolate pudding with whipped cream not like a cake at all.

Made this for a potluck and it was a hit. I did omit the nuts and used a thick sugar graham cracker crust that I baked first to get the crispy part. Them cooled for about an hour and proceeded with the recipe as written. Yum!

This was only so-so. Nothing really special. Taste like pudding on a crust with whipped cream. I'd rather spend my calories on something more tasty.Probably won't make again.

Very good. Loved the crust. Next time I will try adding 1/4 cup milk to the pudding. Thought it was alittle too thick.

The "Crust" for this recipe was not crust but loosly bound flour and nuts. When I tried to spread the cream cheese the crust moved with the spread making this attempted dessert a disaster that wound up in the sink.

I know I followed the directions exactly and I have reviewed the recipe multiple times. That being said this was the worst cake I have ever made.
