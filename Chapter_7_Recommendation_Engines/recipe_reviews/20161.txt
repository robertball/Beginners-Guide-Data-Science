This recipe was good. I wanted to try one other than the one that I use, but I think that the one that I normally use is better. You have 4 cups Bisquik with  8 oz. of sour cream, and then 3/4 cup Sprite (7-up will do). Then I bake it at 400 degrees until golden brown. Yummm!!!!!

These biscuits were fantastic--the best ever!  They were so light and fluffy, and they rose about an inch while baking!  I tried the JP Big Daddy biscuit recipe because everyone raved about it, I was extremely disappointed.  This recipe on the other hand was absolutely delicious.

I agree that these were a little dry, but they were still good and very easy to make!  I used diet sprite and they were a little flat, but they are just going to be chewed up any way.  I used them with sausage gravy.  Thanks Arvilla!

These biscuits are dry and have an odd sweet taste to them.

These were great, but any one making them should poor melted butter over them after they come out of the oven...they were a little dry.

I tried these because they sounded strange and boy are they good!  Great to whip up at the last minute also!

I thought these biscuits were good, but you should note that you will need more baking mix for kneading.  I found them dry as well.  They are ready in about 12 minutes, not 20.

I used my own homemade healthy baking mix. These were easy and cheap using on hand ingredients but really not our favorite biscuits. It could be that my baking mix was healthier, using whole wheat white flour but that really shouldn't matter in the end. And the baking time was WAY off. 12 minutes and they were done. You think that you slather anything with butter, it's going to taste good but I guess I was really hoping for more. Too bad. Maybe if I get inspired to try this again, I'll use some of the other reviewers suggestions and use sour cream or even melted butter instead of buttermilk.

I loved these. I love the occasional treat of biscuits and honey. These cooked up perfectly for me. I used Sprite Zero which was probably flat after sitting on the counter all night. The cook time is way off, they were done in 10 minutes. Even the bisquick box says 8-10 minutes.

I will give you the fact that I was expecting a lot from this recipe. What I was expecting to pop out of the oven was a yummy, fluffy biscuit. What I received was an overdone dense slab of bread. The biscuits weren't fluffy at all, and I checked the biscuits at the minimum time you instructed to find them cooked way past my preference. Sorry, but this just didn't work for me.

I don't care for sweet biscuits so instead of lemon lime soda, I used club soda. They really aren't much different than if you just used the recipe on the box of Bisquick. Maybe the sweet from the soda is what makes them different (if the sweet is what you like).

Nice consistency, great taste and texture. Easy to make with just a few ingredients. We had some fresh strawberries and leftover whipped cream so we had strawberry shortcake with these-they were great. Will keep this recipe, and use it again.

Cooked for the length of time stated the biscuits were very hard and almost burnt. When I cut the cooking time by half the biscuits were fine.
