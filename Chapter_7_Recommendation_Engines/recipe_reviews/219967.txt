I increased the vanilla to a full teaspoon, used pecans instead of walnuts and mini chocolate chips. I made muffins out of this recipe--I actually got 12 really big muffins out of one recipe. I baked them at 350* for 22 minutes. I did let them cool in the pan overnight. I make A LOT of banana bread and A LOT of muffins (my family can eat 12 muffins in one day and that's on a slow day) and I think this is one of the best banana breads I've ever made. My husband called to tell me from work that HE thinks this is one of the better banana bread recipes I've made......and that's huge coming from him. This one's a keeper.

Fabulous recipe for an all time favorite!  And, I must admit I did make this using those last three overly ripe bananas, lol! I doubled the vanilla and to give it a little spice I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I also subbed 1 Tbsp. of buttermilk vs. milk. You could do half brown sugar and half white sugar depending on what you have in your kitchen. And, this is great with or without the nuts and chocolate chips! I topped this with a little turbinado sugar before popping it in the oven for a little extra added crunch on top. I baked it at 350 for a little over an hour and just as Chef John states, it's "scrumptious"!

Great recipe!!!!  I have made this banana bread 3 times.  Quick and easy and more importantly....delicious.  The only thing I do differently is add mini chocolate chips instead of the regular size.  I love this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

For a slightly spiced version of this great recipe try adding in 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, & 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg.
For all of you who can´t find the recipe, it´s in the text under the video :)

Very moist and delicious.  Followed as directed except I used 4 ripe bananas (small & medium)  and I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, which was plenty.  Also I didn't have to bake as long as they indicated so I would watch and use the tooth pick method for doneness.

This is a wonderful recipe - the best banana bread I've ever made. But ... we added a dash of nutmeg and two dashes of cinnamon. (Oh, and we didn't have the chocolate chips.)

The added spices really kicked this recipe into a whole new level.

I thought the recipe was great! I almost didn't try it because it is so similar to others. I think what intrigued me was not using an electric mixer.  I also think the 1/2 cup of butter and extra sugar is what made this bread so good. The only change I made was I used sour cream instead of milk and next time I will reduce the salt to half. I divided it into two loaves using (Demarle loaf pans) and baked at 350 for only 40 minutes. This is definitely the best banana bread I've ever made!  Thanks Chef John for sharing it with the All Recipe world!

I folllowed this recipe to a tee and I made sure not to over stir and cooked it for the allotted time and Ifound this banana brad to be dry. It will definitely will need butter spread on it! perhaps it needs a little more milk. Even watching the video Chef John's banana bread seemed to have more liquid in it.

On my 3rd loaf. Followed video instructions to a tee! My family loved this- left out walnuts as we are not walnut fans. Goes fast in my house!

Really easy and sooooo tasty!
My kids and I bake this together and love this particular recipe. We add walnuts and bittersweet chocolate chunks. We also add about 3/4 TBSP cinnamon to the dry mix and sprinkle some more on top of mini loafs. It's really moist and full of flavor. Two thumbs up!

I love this banana bread.  I made just a few changes.  I used 4 bananas, since that is what I had and didn't want to throw one out.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also used mini-chocolate chips.  I will definitely make this again.

Second go around for this recipe. Didn't want to do a loaf.  Doubled the recipe and did muffins instead.  A little easier for this family with all the kids no longer at home.  Me and my hubby can then just pull from the freezer, zap and enjoy with morning coffee.  No walnuts this time but did add the choc chips.  When the grandkids come this is a perennial favourite.

My son is hooked on this. I cheat on this recipe by using Trader Joe"s Multigrane baking mix (in leu of the flour and base). I added a few more ripe bananas. Be careful not to overbake. My convection oven has this ready in less than 1 hr. I highly recommend it. Why not 5 stars, because I had a better tasking banana bread one time. :-)!

Simply delicious !  I have made this banana loaf a half a dozen times since. Now, I have added a few changes to the ingredients; I added a whole table spoon of Vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar  and added 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips ( due to nut allergy, I eliminated Walnut). The banana loaf turned out great, moist and delicious! Love it ! ---- Lily

Tasty banana bread! Everyone loved it. I used pecans instead of walnuts as my family can't eat walnuts. Still it was a delicious recipe. I also used butter which he calls for. I know many substitute margarine but  for me I'll stick with the butter. Very most, flavorful and filling. I love John's recipe videos and have used many of them. This recipe also has a video. Makes it so much easier for me to follow.

This is a terrific recipe.  I have made this countless times and I've changed the ingredients from walnuts to pecans. I've added currants seeped in bourbon or golden raisins and of course always the chocolate chips.  I've doubled it and made mini loaves for gifts. I can't tell you the number of return phone calls I get asking for another loaf. Most of my friends are foodies and I am an avid recipe tester.  Even though I have many banana bread recipes this is the one I make the most. Rose Ann

This by far is the best banana bread out there, taken if you love chocolate like my family does. Great banana bread taste, chocolate complements the sweet bread and makes it more moist. TIP: Only make by hand. If you use a Kitchen Aid, unless you know when to stop, it turn into mush in the middle that will never bake out. Do not over mix this recipe. You don't have to worry if you mix it by hand.

We made muffins with this - got 14 large ones.  Sprayed the paper muffin liners with cooking spray.  Added cinnamon and grated nutmeg to the flour mix.  Did not use nuts.  Used more than 1/4 tsp vanilla and slightly more than 1/3 cup chocolate chips - used mostly mini chips.  Took just 22 minutes to cook at 350 (directions shared by Sarah Jo -thanks!).   As with most of Chef John's recipes shared here, this was easy and delicious.

Yummy!  I tried several of the most popular banana bread recipes from this site.  All were good but this one gets top marks from my family. It was a classic banana taste and texture.  Travelled well in lunches (some breads crumble) and stayed moist for a couple of days.  We omitted the nuts and increased the chocolate chips to a full cup.  Now no one wants to eat the bananas in the fruit bowl any longer because they want to save them for this bread!  Great recipe, thank you!

Super delicious. I did make a few changes just to my own tastes. I added about a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon and then increased the vanilla to a full tsp. I left out the walnuts because my family doesn't like them. I also sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mix to the top just before putting in the oven and I must say this is the best banana bread recipe I have made so far. Love it! All of Chef John's stuff has been wonderful so far.

Tasty with a good texure. Not as moist as I had hoped and could use more banana flavor but pretty good. Followed the recipe exactly and batter was too much for both a foil bread pan and a glass one. Overflowed in the oven. Also had to ad 10 mins to cooking time.

EVERY TIME I  make one of  Chef John's recipes, it has ALWAYS  been a home run!   I jokingly say "I love me some Chef John", but ya know?  That's not far from the truth!
This is the first time I have made this recipe and it is SO GOOD!  
Whenever I make recipe, I follow it to the letter unless I need to make a substitute for something I don't have on hand.  Afterwards,  I will tweak it to my tastes.  With Chef John's recipes,  I  don't tweak anything and with good reason.  I never need to! 
This recipe is DA BOMB!

I have been making this banana bread for a couple years now and it always turns out delicious!  Never fails me.  I'm writing the review today because I want to share the fact that I have tweaked the recipe to be vegan and it is JUST as delicious!  If you're interested in making it vegan just substitute the butter for vegan butter or margarine.  I omit the salt if there's salt in these.  Then, to substitute the eggs and the milk, I just use 1/2 cup almond (or any vegan) milk with 1 tsp. cider vinegar mixed into it.  That's it!  Everything else stays the same.  When making it vegan I use 2 loaf pans.  For some reason it works better.  Maybe Chef John can tell us why! :)  If anybody tries it let me know.

I did not particularly care for thise. My boyfriend like the chocolate in it and he can't tell one banana bread from another so it didn't bother him. But I thought it was too dry and crumbly and I did not care for the chocolate (just my preference). It is not bad, per se, sometimes you just have to search until you find what you like. But I have other banana bread recipes that I prefer, with or without the chocolate.

I really love this recipe.  Perfectly moist and so easy to do.  I don't add the chips and nuts cause my family doesn't like it.  I think it would be awesome with chocolate.

So good! I've probably made this recipe about 10 times now. I usually leave out the nuts (because I'm too cheap), add a few extra chocolate chips, and sometimes even use only 2 bananas and it's still good. I prefer it super cold, straight out of the fridge. I've gotten many requests to make it over again. I do find that I have to bake it for an extra 10 minutes to fully cook the top where it splits open, but that might just be because of my oven or my glass loaf pan.

I searched through others recipes of this flavor to find the best reviews and that was also simple. This one caught my attention  more the others that rated 5stars. I for some reason chose to try this one. I am so happy that I did. Some said that it was too sweet. I made this recipe exactly as written without altering it at all. It was PERFECT!  However I will try one of the others and really compare them. Thanks Chef John for another GREAT recipe!

I'm not a fan of banana bread but when i made this just last week, I liked how it taste. We don't have walnuts here so i just omitted both walnuts and choco chips. It still yummy and moist. The best recipe I've tried so far.

just some small changes - increased vanilla to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and it was PERFECT.  Best Banana Bread I've ever made, and I've tried soooo many recipes.  I loved the choc chips in it, too.  This one goes in my permanent recipe box.  Now I'm going to have to buy bananas and make sure nobody eats them, specifically so they become over-ripe and I can make more of this banana bread.  My whole family wants MORE and I'm out of bananas.

It was definitely interesting and different with the chocolate chips but not necessarily better than a regular banana bread recipe.  I didn't think it was quite moist enough.  I think I will try adding chocolate chips to a recipe that calls for buttermilk or sour cream rather than make this recipe as-is again.  I think my regular recipe that calls for banana extract is better.

I have a problem getting quick breads to cook all the way through before they burn on the top, but not this one. I followed the recipe and made no substitutions but did leave out the chocolate chips per the request of the hubster and this turned out amazing. There were no doughie spots at all. Shared this with friends and got great reviews.

I love this recipe. I highly recommend this recipe to people that love banana bread. Sadly I make it and it's gone the next day. That's how much my family loves it. TIP: if you get air bubbles, let it sit for a few minutes before putting it in the oven. Usually it happens without me thinking about it because I like to clean up before I put it in the oven.

This banana bread was very easy and had great taste and texture, not overly moist like some recipes and not too dry either. I used 1tsp vanilla and added 1 cup of chocolate chips and no nuts. I used a 9 x 4" loaf pan, but ended up having a big spill over in my oven half way through baking.  This may have happened because baking at altitude (5800 ft) can often produce surprises.  Nevertheless, next time I will use a larger loaf pan.

There is no better recipe for banana bread, at least in my experience. I do add sour cream instead of milk, and if you toast the walnuts first, it takes it to another level. It's easy to double the recipe and make two loaves.

My college daughter loved it and so did my husband.  But I like the traditional banana bread better without chocolate chips.  I guess I was never crazy about chocolate chips anyway.  I think I will skip those next time....

I have made this recipe 3 times now, but this time I put in 1/4 tps cinnamon, I increased the vanilla to 1/2 tps & the chocolate chips to a 1/2 cup using dark & semi sweet chips. I also used half & half instead of my milk.... Final outcome was amazing my boyfriend likes this one the best so far.

This bread was DRY!  I followed the recipe to the letter, not making any substitutions and using very ripe bananas.  I had to pull the bread out of the oven 5 minutes early and even then, it was way overcooked.  My husband and I agree, this was overly sweet, a tad salty and lacked in real flavor, on top of being way too dry.  Too bad, I thought this had potential.  I didn't use my normal recipe because I didn't have sour cream, well, lesson learned.  I will either chuck the bananas in the freezer or run to the store the next time if I don't have it on hand.

This was very good, very moist, but that was probably because I accidentally added too much milk :) The cooking time was way to long. I took mine out at 50 minutes. Also, all of my nuts and chocolate chip sank to the bottom, but other than that, it was great.

The recipe is okay, but Flour Bakery's is much better.  Ran into the same issue with Chef John and several other recipes:  3 bananas - are they large bananas?  Are they small?  I'm sure that after you mashed them up you measured them, so please share the exact measure as not all bananas are the same.

I love this recipe, but I wanted some flavor so I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, used half brown sugar and the other white sugar with some more vanilla.  Perfect! Each of my 4 brothers ate a loaf.

so chef john?  Perfect!!!!  I used one bowl and my 1975 wedding gift avacado green mixer by a reluctant to take her coat off at the reception  grandmother i His side.  To this day It works and so does this bread!  I had only m&m's so threw a handful in. Worked great  and so did da-mixer. Yet again and again.

I made this recipe tonight (always on the hunt for the perfect Banana Bread).  Delicious!  Just wonderful Chef John strikes again.  I had to cook it a bit longer but I think my loaf pan was a bit smaller than suggested.  I will use a bigger one next time and there will be a next time.  Its a perfect recipe I love the chocolate and nuts, the chocolate is not overstated.

Husband loved this!  Great recipe without walnuts and choc chips as well!  i put a basic crumb topping of butter, sugar, and cinnamon on it that my family loves.  Sometimes, i add cinnamon into the dough.

I would leave recipe exactly as it is (I didn't care for adding the extra cinnamon etc. as was suggested by someone, but each to their own taste). My husband picked up on it right away, and asked why it tasted different -- said not as good as other ones I'd made.

it's much easier to make and just as good if not better than my long time favorite banana bread! I love the addition of chocolate morsels!

Easy to follow recipe. I add an additional banana and vanilla extract for richer flavor and subtract the chocolate. Great fresh out of the oven and then individual slices reheated with butter in a hot skillet for breakfast.

Since my wife and I thought adding chocolate chips to the banana bread would take away from the bananas  in the bread. We decided to not add them. Well we ended up having a little extra batter left over when we filled our baking dish. So we thought. Why not add some of the chocolate chips to the extra batter and make  muffins with them just to try out. The muffins where the winner in taste. Besides that, there was other things we done to the whole batter mix. My bananas where small and I ended up using all six of them. I also used 1 tsp of vanilla  instead of the 1/4 tsp. and a dash of cinnamon and divided the amount of sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. I like tinkering with recipes and will make this again with pecans instead of walnuts. Maybe  making muffins and just adding other ingredients in the batter just before pouring them in the muffin pans to narrow the results. I will let you know how that turns out later.

This is one of the best recipes for banana bread. I have made it in a loaf and as muffins. Really doesn't last long at my house ?? I ?? Chef John and his recipes. When is he getting his own show?

This was awesome! It's very fluffy and moist, although next time I'll do half of the salt, it's a little too salty.

After the Chef John Smothered Pork Chop recipe hit, I decided to keyword search "Chef John". at the beginning of his video he says this recipe is as good as others, but really, its better. Chef John is a great chef in my book! oh I did one tweak, substituted pumpkin seeds for the walnuts for allergy reasons and it was a great sub!

Excellent recipe!  Been looking for a replacement recipe for the one the movers lost and this is it.  Moist, tender and full of flavor.  Love it.  I substituted buttermilk, and pecans.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla.  Will try adding cinnamon and nutmeg per other reviewers suggestions.  Enjoy!  :)

Delish. I have never made banana bread and this was great. I did think that instead of three bananas maybe one more. I wanted more of a banana flavor.

Followed this recipe exactly except for a few changes - used 5 bananas, did not add milk, doubled the vanilla extract, added 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and half cup chopped pecans. Came out delicious, moist on the inside and crust on the outside.

I am actually going to make this again tomorrow.  I made it the first time and I didn't have any vanilla, but didn't know until it was too late, so I popped it in the oven and prayed, it was delicious.  I bought vanilla this time so I'm hoping that the flavor is even better this time!

I do have to admit also, I did not use the walnuts (didn't have any) nor the dark chocolate chips (not a fan) and I don't plan to use either again, but I don't think it affects the core recipe any.  While I will agree with another user that you might have to put butter on it, I must confess I would put butter on it regardless.  Only thing better in this life than butter is bacon, nice and crispy :).

Dear Chef John, AWESOME BREAD, back in 2005 I a dear friend passed away and she gave me a receipe for Banana bread and it was almost
identical in ingredients (she may have gotten this from you) Iused
it for years, then ONE DAY, I misplaced it, couldn't for the life of me find it again.  THEN I happened on your receipe WHAT A LIVESAVER,
I have baked this Banana bread for my son and family and they are in awe of how moist this is.  Now for Thanksgiving 2014 making about 3 loaves for dinner and give aways.    Sherry

The flavor of this bread is remarkable. I tried the very highly rated banana bread on this site and was wildly unimpressed. Contrarily,  this bread brings lots of flavor with a delightful surprise of chocolate. I must chorus Chef John's suggestion that this bread is the perfect accompaniment to a fresh cup of coffee.
I followed the reviewers' suggestions and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves.

This recipe came out wonderfully.  The bread was moist but didn't crumble.  There was no over arching flavor that dominated (sugar or flour).  I did modify it by removing the chocolate chips, nuts, and cocoa.  My husband wants his banana bread to taste like banana bread through and through.  I would also use 4 bananas next time instead of 3.  Regardless, it was a really good first go round! Will use this recipe again and make a batch with the other ingredients.

I have standard banana bread recipe that I've used for years (like 20) but saw this one and thought I'd give it a try. Really glad I did! Made it with a combo of walnuts and pecans and made muffins instead of the loaf- they turned out wonderfully and will make it again

I have tried several of Chef John's recipes and have not been disappointed yet. I am a 65 yr. old guy who has always loved to cook, do some BBQ catering etc., however I am no baker. But...there laid 3 bananas that needed something done with them:-)

I followed the directions exactly as this was one of my first tries baking anything. It was beautiful when it came out of the oven and tasted great. I was stunned:-) It did fall pretty badly after cooling though. Likely a result of my technique?

I follewed the recipe exactly because I intended to review it. It blows my mind when a reviewer follows up their comments...good or bad...with the disclaimer that "I changed everything about it" ?!?

Thanks Chef John

I made this bread today and it was okay but not my favorite recipe. My husband ate it and so did my father-in-law and both are not picky eaters but preferred my older recipe. I like to try new things but this is not a keeper for me. These muffins seemed a bit oily for my preference and I followed the recipe to the letter except for leaving out the chocolate chips as my husband is allergic to chocolate. It's good enough I guess but needs tweaked in some way.

Kids loved it. I did make a dozen muffins out of these by cutting the recipe to 8 servings. Maybe I'll try the whole recipe next time. Hopefully it won't spill out.

Yum!!!  This is wonderful bread.  Not overly sweet, very moist- too tasty to stop eating!  I made it as written and love it, but I am sure one could add other spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) if one wanted to "fancy it up".  I, however, like its simplicity.  Thanks for another go-to keeper Chef John :)

I will never use another Banana Bread recipe again.  This is so easy, no mess to clean up and better yet...it's so moist and delicious.  I do omit the choc chips to save on calories. One loaf was gone in one day...our 2 grandkids ate it all as an after school snack.  They keep asking, Grammy when are you going to make more banana bread?

I do agree this was probably the best banana recipe I'd every tried. I followed the recipe, also added cinnamon and nutmeg to it, however in the end after I'd finished baking it and let it cool down, I noticed that it was quite crumbly when I tried to slice it? Any ideas why?

I made for the first time banana bread an I was thrilled by the result.The only change I made only a health reason, was to replace white sugar with brown.

Made just as written. Baked only one hour.  A bit on the dry side and not extremely flavorful.  Will try another recipe next time.  Probably one using veggie oil instead of butter.  I have both zucchini bread and pumpkin bread recipes using veggie oil that always turn out moist and delicious.

I'm not a banana person but this bread was delish! Of course my hubby is not a chocolate person and he would prefer not having the chocolate chips, but he was over ruled by everyone in the house! This bread flew over the plate.

This is THE BEST banana bread ever! I love to try it with all kinds of chopped nuts and chocolate and you can never go wrong with an extra banana. Ive been making this recipe for 3 months now and its always come out perfect. My husband loves it and we often fight for the last piece. Thank you so much for sharing this Chef John, I'm definitely going to try your other recipe's!

Thank you, Chef John!  Once again, your video and easy-to-follow instructions were entertaining and to-a-tee allowing me to produce the Best banana bread I have ever made.  Okay ... It's the Only banana bread I have ever made, but this is the only recipe I will ever need.  The end product was moist and delicious -- even my Hubby (who is't a carbo-hound) ate half the loaf by himself and then helped me with the other half!  High praise indeed from my man of few words who uttered, "So, Honey ...Do we have any more bananas?" as he viewed the final crumbs on his plate.  Thank you for posting!

This smelled so good my stomach was groweling so loud while it was cooking. When it was finally done i was not dissapointed. I am allergic to bananas so when I had some it was really just to taste it to see if it was worth making again. It was so good though that i ended up eating 2 (ok i will me totally honest 3) thick slices, with each slice getting progressivle thicker! I left the nuts out because i am allergic to those as well, This recpie was full of banana flavor without being to sweet. I will make again, next time i think i will try some brown sugar, maybe 1/2 white 1/2 brown. The bread is so good that you don't need the chocolate chips too. Will make again.
Also my 3 1/2 year old helped mash the bananas she did such a good job they were almost liquified, maybe that is why the banban flavor was so good? She also enjoyed eating the bread, although i think she likes licking the beaters better.

Another great recipe by Chef John. As always, I used previously frozen bananas and bumped the chocolate chips up to 1 cup and omitted the nuts due to an allergy.  Super moist even though I baked it for an additional 5 minutes.

This is my first ever review on Allrecipes and I have been a member for 16 years! I have probably tried 30 different banana bread recipes and this is by far the best I have ever had!!! I absolutely love the recipe as is but I’ve also added an extra banana (because I happened to have 4 overripe bananas) and it was a phenomenal as well! The secret to this recipe is that the bananas should be really overripe and not just slightly ripening. Chef John, keep the recipes coming!!!

The very best I've ever made! The chocolate chips are a nice addition and made in my convection oven, It is crunchy on the outside and moist and cake like on the inside.

I added 2 teaspoons of coco powder; /12 cup of dry cranberries; used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup; added a handful of chopped walnuts; I also added 1/4 cup of fine coconut  flakes without sugar.

Any time I search on line for a recipe I go to CHef John first. The banana bread was no exception. I used regular mini chocolate chips instead of dark. Amazing.

It truly is the best banana bread. My DH says banana bread hurts his stomach but this bread doesn’t for some reason. I don’t know if it’s my oven but at 325 it takes longer than time stated. Will try 350 next time.

Best banana bread I've ever made. No burnt edges, no raw center. Perfect. I did make it more traditional by using raisins instead of chocolate chips. Second time making it in 2 days!

I've made this recipe several times (along with some others from the Chef!) This time, my preschooler helped with the stirring (between ingredients) and by pulsing the LO Button on my food processor when chopping the walnuts. My neighbors think I'm a great cook, we just follow awesome recipes! Wish I could submit a picture... Most beautiful piece of culinary artwork...

I’ve made this a couple times and find it far too sweet. I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup instead and it’s a far more balanced sweetness. Everything else is perfect.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever made!!!! It is super moist and very flavorful. I have made it plain, with walnuts, with chocolate chips, and with a combination of walnuts and chocolate chips every time it is wonderful. We actually prefer it with just walnuts. This bread stays so moist all week it doesn't need any butter or warming up to moisten. My husband and kids absolutely love it and ask for it every week so it has now become a Sunday staple. I do tweak it slightly based on other reviews and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and three or four bananas depending on how many we have going bad, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfect every time. I highly recommend this recipe and I love everything Chef John makes!

Family and coworkers loved it.  It's a moist dense bread with lots of flavor.  I'm not a fan of nuts in bread but I did add some mini chocolate chips.  It was delicious. This is now my go-to recipe for banana bread.

This recipe was okay, but I felt like it was missing something. Next time, I will add more vanilla because I love the flavor of  vanilla. Maybe I will add a little brown sugar and more bananas. I didn't particularly like the chocolate chips in the bread so I will leave it out next time. The bread did taste much better warm than room temperature.

Easy and moist. I added nutmeg and cinnamon, and increased vanilla a bit. I also substituted 1/2n 1/2 instead of milk. Because I live in high altitude, I added 1 tablespoon flour and an extra splash of 1/2n1/2. We use macadamia nuts instead of walnuts due to allergies. Big hit!

The video shows 1/2 stick of butter but the recipe says 1/2 cup.  I've made it both ways and like 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) better.

I made this exactly as written.  I used a dollar store thin aluminum loaf pan.  I opted to trust the recipe, and left the bread undisturbed, without opening the oven and letting any heat out, for one hour and ten minutes as directed.  Upon my initial visual inspection, I felt it needed just a little bit longer, so I replaced it for 10 more minutes.  The flavor and consistency of the product was exactly what I was hoping for.  Not overly sweet, very moist, very dense, with banana flavor the star of the show.  I was concerned the amount of baking powder would turn this into a cake, but that was absolutely not the case.  I might, the next time I make it, hit it with a pinch of clove, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, if I've got a hankering for those flavors, but I do appreciate the un-complicated, straightforwardness of letting the banana just be banana more than I thought I would.

I just left out the chocolate chips for this recipe. It came out delicious and moist. Satisfies the sweet tooth without being too sweet.

It came out pretty good, not too moist. I omitted the semi-dark chocolate chip morsels as the family I was making it for didn't want chocolate chips in their banana bread. One member said it was perfect, the other said it could be a little sweeter, I figured it would be perfect if I had added the chocolate chips. Oh well! Will definitely try this recipe again since I have more bananas to use up! Thanks Chef John!

I've made this bread so many times and it is delicious. I usually don't add the chocolate chips (just not something I usually have on hand) but it's a nice addition when I can.

I liked this method of adding the ingredients and did it by hand.  I thought the bread was a little more moist the next day.

This was great!  I made the banana bread as the recipe said, but I mixed the batter in a stand mixer instead of a hand mixer.  I also added a little more chocolate chips and some sweet coconut shavings.  It turned out to be delicious!

I really enjoyed the ease of this recipe, I didn’t care for the chocolate chips but that’s just a personal preference. The bread itself came out perfect and moist(sorry if you hate that word) if you follow the directions. 
Overall great recipe!

I made this this afternoon, and I will definitely make it again! I used 2.5 bananas per loaf because that is what I had on hand, and for me, that amount worked perfectly! One loaf I made as directed, with walnuts and chocolate chips; the other I made plain, without the nuts or chocolate! Both were excellent, but I definitely preferred the one with the chocolate and nuts. 5 stars, will make again!

These are in the oven. I hate making substitutes in recipes but I did with this one. I didn’t have baking powder so I used self-rising flour. Only had 2 bananas, and I didn’t follow the recipe cause I thought I knew it all. I mixed my sugar in with the flour, so I had to mix my margarine in with the banana . Yes I used margarine instead of butter because dollar general did not have real butter, what’s up with that?

Yes, I made a change out of necessity. I ran out of all purpose flour so I added oatmeal to it since I didn't have enough flour. I might make it again.

Easy to make but driest banana bread I have ever had.  It has to be soaked in berries or cream to be edible.  My bananas were quite ripe and I measured exactly as the recipe called for.  I will not be making this again.

I’ve made this many times now with the original Chef John recipe as well as modified versions and they all turned out well!
I’ve reduced the sugar and also tried oil vs butter for a dairy free version.  
Thank you Chef John, your recipes are always on point!

I actually tripled the recipe to put some in the freezer for later.  Better cleaning up one mess instead of 3!!   The bread had good consistency and flavor.   Would definitely make again

This banana bread is delightful! I’m not usually a fan of chocolate chips in my banana bread, but I loved it and my much pickier parents did as well. There are always old bananas in my house, so I make a lot of banana bread (and stick it in the freezer for when I need to take something to someone’s house). This recipe is a keeper, it’s my new favorite. I’ll use it many times.

Fantastic recipe. I did make some modifications based on other's suggestions. 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I made this into muffins (about 16 of standard size) at 350F for about 22-25 minutes. It turned out so much better than I expected! Very moist and super tasty.

I was looking for a new banana recipe, and Chef John hasn't let me down yet.  Although I would have liked to use less sugar I decide to make it as written first to see how it was.  I did forget to add the milk, but I don't think that hurt, it came out great. I used a Pyrex loaf pan. I still think it would be good with a bit less sugar in it, will try that next time. I also saw some added cinnamon or other spices, might try that too. But overall, crisp outside, moist inside, very good!

Mediocre - average banana bread with chocolate chips - and a bit heavy, at that.

It was delicious, moist and soft  I would 100% make it again the only I did change was how much of the chocolate chips I put in which was 1/2 a cup instead of 1/3

The bread was heavy and slightly dry.  But with belief in Chef John’s recipes, I respectfully made adjustments.  After the 3rd try, I hit it!!  These are the adjustments:  1-5/8 cup flour, 1-1/2 tsp baking powder,  1-1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, add 1 tsp banana extract in addition to the vanilla extract, omit the milk.  The result is a light, soft texture and full banana flavor.  Took me years to reach this satisfaction.  Thank you Chef John for leading the way!

I used four bananas, and also added some blueberries in, it came out delicious, I use the 5 by 9 loaf pan and I had to bake it for 25 minutes longer than this recipe called for.  it probably would have baked quicker in a cake pan and would have been just as good.

Yum yum! I didn't have enough walnuts so I added some pecans. I didn't have chocolate chips so I used milk chocolate toffee bits. I like the subtlety of just 1/3 cup of the chocolate. Quick and easy too!

This is the recipe I was looking for. The texture is much lighter than my old brick like one. I didn’t use the chocolate chips and only had two bananas but worked fine.

I didn’t use chocolate chips and it was great! A tini tiny but dry, maybe because there were no choco chips. Another Banana bread recipe I made was too moist! So must be a fine line, I preferred this one than the other moist recipe.

This was the first time that I have made banana bread. I was a luttle confused that they recipe said to bake at 325 for approximately one hour, whereas, most othet recipes said to bake at 350 for approximately one hour. I had to keep afding more baking time and checking but it came out fairly well.

This is the best banana bread I’ve ever tasted!  Only problem is baking time. 1hr. 10 minutes is too long. I went with an hour but even this was too much. Next time I’ll start checking at 45 minutes and go on to 50 minutes at the most.

perfect every time. It makes a light loaf. I use a 9x13 brownie pan instead of a loaf pan to cut the cooking time in half. Add a handful of chocolate chips and you have the perfect treat for yourself or company!

I've loved banana bread all my life since my grandma and mom made it for me.  However, this is the best recipe that I've ever found.  My wife takes it to the dental office where she works. It's always a hit there with her co-workers and with our neighbors. When they learn that I made it, they are even more amazed.  Who couldn't love this wonderful banana bread anyway? This batch is going to have dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate morsels.  I think I'll yum it up a bit with a 1/2 cup of the mixed chocolates instead of the 1/3 cup that the recipe calls for. I'll also give it an 'extra generous' cup of nuts. After all, it can only make it better.

This sounds like a great recipe, but every banana bread recipe I've ever seen gives me how many bananas to use. I want an exact measurement,  like 1 cup, etc. I've made banana bread a few times, and in nearly every case, I've ended up with banana mush in the middle.  Chef John,  please give an exact measurement for the bananas.

Very good! I had three bananas that I had to use quick and found this recipe. I didn’t have the chocolate chips but subbed it with raisins, and it was great! Also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.

I accidently put a little too much salt but it was only noticeable after eating half the loaf. Great recipe!

This was the first time I used this recipe. I used four bananas instead of three. I didn’t use chocolate chips . Had to bake it for ten extra minutes. It came perfect! Moist and delicious   Thank You Chef John For this wonderful recipe.

This was a great recipe! I made a couple changes and used only 1/2 cup white sugar &1/2 cup turbinado. Then I left out the chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup coconut flakes instead. It needed to bake 20 min longer but turned out beautiful and delicious!

I made half the recipe with 2 bananas. In place of the choc chips, I added 1 c. chopped strawberries. I heavy handed the vanilla, and added cinnamon.  I made them into mini-muffins, it made 3 1/2 dozen.  Still baked at 325 degrees, for 10 min.   Delicious!

Excellent as is!  Since the first batch, I've made a couple of modifications to more suit my tastes.  I used whole wheat flour, chopped up a 3.5 oz 85% cocoa chocolate bar instead of chips, instead of 1 cup sugar I used 1/2 cup brown sugar (minus 1 tbsp) and 1/2 cup (minus 1 tbsp) of Sugar in the Raw - I don't care much for overly sweet things so this seems to be about right for me.  I slice it up and put each slice in individual zip lock sandwich bags and then put into a larger freezer bag.  Slathered with peanut butter or apple butter, it's a great breakfast or afternoon snack.  Thanks Chef John!

I've so many banana bread recipes over the years some were good, some didn't even make it to the family. But I have finally found the recipe I'll keep for ever. It was easy and came out great. Served it for desert with some ice cream. No left overs of bread but lots of ice cream.

I made it twice. My seven-year-old son and all his pals love it. I love it too!  It had the right consistency each time. My son does not like bananas but will eat Chef John's Banana bread and ask for more. Love, Love, love!

I have made this recipe 5x's since Aug 2018.  The only thing I've done is replaced walnuts with pecans (since I had a ton of them) and added chocolate chip morsels.  Absolutely delicious!  The bread would only last 3 days thanks to hungry mouths, but I did keep a loaf for 7 days and still moist and delicious! And it's passed the family and friends test with 5-stars!  This is a bread I'll be making for the upcoming holiday parties.

This recipe sounded a little drier than my regular, so I doctored a bit and it was fabulous.
Used 4 bananas instead of 3, a whole teaspoon of vanilla, a whole cup of mini chocolate chips instead of 1/3.
Also I substituted coconut sugar for the white sugar, added a few generous shakes of cinnamon, and I didn’t have walnuts so I used candied pecans instead. (That turned out to be a super delicious happy accident!)
My kids are currently gobbling it up and it’s defo one of the best chocolate banana breads I’ve made.

I make this banana bread all the time. This is my go-to recipe. I don't use the chocolate chips, but that's just my preference. I do add the chopped walnuts. My family prefers the banana bread without salt and I like it with salt, so I end up making 2 batches and freezing it. It never goes to waste.

I cheat and put the eggs, bananas, oil/melted butter, and sugar into the blender and whip them.  Makes this easy as you just fold into the dry ingredients and put it into the pan to bake.

I love this recipe. Made several times, sometimes with or without nuts or chocolate chips. One time I only had two large ripe bananas, it’s still turned out good. Also makes great muffins with a little cinnamon, brown sugar crumble on top just before baking! Yummy.

I always love this recipe every time I make it. Moist, tender, and goes well with a crumble topping. But I never seem to have Walnuts or raisins with me. It's still delicious though.

This turned out awesome! I changed cinnamon to 1 tbsp.  And added a tsp and a half of vanilla. And instead of chocolate chips I used Reese’s peanut butter chips. A heaping cup. I turned oven off 10 minutes before recommended time and left it in for 15 minutes and took out of oven and removed from pan to cool. Super moist. Will definitely make this again and again. Only lasted 2 days at my house.

I adjusted the spices like others before me.  I increased the milk.  I cooked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes.  It still came out dry.  Maybe I overcooked it But it seemed fine when I took it out of the oven.  I also won't add the chocolate chips again, I didn't like them at all.

This is a good and tasty banana bread.  The added bonus is it's easy to make.  I was hesitant to add the chocolate chips.  I did, but next time I'll omit them.  I don't think they add anything.  I'm a banana bread purist so walnuts is enough for me.  Over the years, I've tried many different recipes,  This is one of the better ones.

I don't care for the nuts and chocolate chips together in this. Otherwise, it was good. I think I'll keep looking for the best recipe though.

I love love love this recipe! I like that I don't need sour cream to make this moist bread, since I usually don't have any in the fridge.
I have made it countless times (and not just when I had old bananas to use up!); and I usually substitute the walnuts for extra chocolate chips.

These weren't as much to our taste as the banana bread recipe I've used for a long time. Not as moist and we prefer the recipe with nutmeg, cinnamon and dried fruit to chocolate chips.

Love it the fact that it has no oil!  I also went with mini-chips, and the chocolate is a nice, subtle touch. 

I also increased the baking time by 10 minutes to create a crispier crust.  This replaced my other banana bread recipes, and will be my go-to from here on.

This is an easy, delicious recipe. I use four bananas  instead of 3 and increase the vanilla extract to 1 tsp. I prefer muffins instead of a loaf of bread, so it makes 18 medium-sized muffins (baked at 350 degrees for 26 minutes). Easy peasy!

This recipe was very easy to follow and put together.  I did use those small bananas over regular sized ripe bananas and dropped chunks of cream cheese into the batter, once I had poured it into the pan.  The loaf came out moist and so tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

Everybody loves this banana bread, it’s the only one that I make. The only thing I do different is I use bread flour and no baking powder, and dump the Ingredients in my bread machine and then I set the bread machine for one hour on bake, then when alarm goes off I bake another 15 minutes. It comes out fantastic.

This is excellent and so easy to make dairy free or vegan. I subbed Earth Balance spread for butter, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for eggs, and added 2.5tsp cinnamon. I also used 4 bananas because I have 19 (!!!) bananas in my freezer. This is the 3rd batch of banana bread I’ve made this week!

After reading a few comments from others that made this I decided to double the vanilla extract which I think was a good idea. I didn't  put in any walnuts because I didn't have any and i only added half the chocolate chips.  I .found it was cooked after one hour. This banana bread turned out great, nice and moist and very tasty.  I would definatley recommend trying it.

I changed it up. I increased clvanills to a full yeasooon and added a half cup cocoa powder. I also did a light mask on the bananas so there were pleanty of chunks. It was tasty and loaded with dark chocolate morsals, walnuts and banana chunks.

I followed the recipe but did no add-ins, just straight banana bread. This is the first time in 32 years I have NOT made my family recipe and I must say it was delicious! My recipe is oil and 1 egg, no butter.
The smell of the butter in conjunction with the banana smell permeated the entire house and tasted as good as it smelled!
The beauty being, you need not butter the slice you savor! Just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds and the buttery smell and taste explode!

Great banana bread recipe!  We only had two bananas, but it was still good.  The only other changes that I made were to add more chocolate chips (about 1 cup) and to omit the nuts.  I also buttered the pan rather than spraying it.  I have a gas oven, so I only cooked it for 60 minutes.  It came out perfectly-nice brown crust on the outside and moist on the inside.

Excelent recipe! I made a few changes to make them a bit healthier:  used coconut oil, whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar (brown) to 2/3 C.  I also used only 2/3 C of chopped walnuts to be able to use more chocolate chips (2/3 C).  I got 18 muffins, baked at 325 F for 20 minutes.   Thank you for another great recipe, Chef!

The prettiest banana bread I have ever made, but not the best tasting. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and still thought the flavor was a bit weak. I will bump up the cinnamon to 3/4 next time. I also thought the mini chocolate chips sort of  disappeared...I will use 1/2 cup next time. Still, solid recipe.

I used a full teaspoon of vanilla and pecans instead of walnuts, and omitted the chocolate chips since I didn't have any. I also sprinkled a few slivered almonds on top before baking so it would have a little more crunch. It came out perfect - moist and tender and full of banana flavor with a sweet, crunchy crust. Will definitely make again for a delicious breakfast treat!

I love Chef John's recipes, including this one.  I just made this today, and waited patiently for it to cool.  The only thing I did differently, was added more vanilla and some cinnamon, and omitted the chocolate chips.  It's delicious!

UPDATE:  I made this again, with the only difference being I used pistachios because I didn't have any walnuts.  It's still delicious!

I've made a few different banana bread recipes from this site, and this is the best one!

My only alterations (based off my personal preferences) were to increase the vanilla to a full teaspoon, decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and upped the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. 

If your bread comes out dry you are probably over mixing! I recommend stirring by hand once you reach the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined and you'll have a lovely moist banana bread!

Followed the recipe but made the following variations after reading some of the reviews: (1) increased the vanilla to 1 tsp, added a big dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, and added dark chocolate chips. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out awesome! Super moist and flavorful.

I had several recipes in our cook book for banana nut bread but was just never pleased with any one.  I tried this one and my wife said to throw the others away and make room for this one.  I found it to have good flavor and was moist.  The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I used light brown sugar since that's what I had on hand.  I guess you could use either one though.  I cooked them in some mini bundt pans for 25 minutes at 325 degrees.  Great job Chef John!

Good!  Made just like the recipe, other than baking in 8 mini loaves ... I have a Wilton pan with 8 mini loaves that hold about a cup or a little more each that I used.  Probably had slightly too much batter in each "cup" ... might make one or two muffins the next time to avoid overfilling the pans.  Took about 35 minutes to bake ... watch carefully if making in smaller pans!  I never use chocolate chips in my banana bread, but did this time just to try it ... hubby and I really didn't care for the chocolate in it, and will probably leave out next time.  Would make this one again!

When I was young I had a great recipe for banana bread.  I have spent years trying to find one similar.   This is not quite it, but my family loved it.  Next time I will add the Cho chips, but this time I added nuts to only half the recipe.  The ONLY changes (and I play with my recipes always) was to use a suggestion on another recipe to coat the pans with cinnamon and sugar, which was a big hit with my grandson,  instead of flour.  And I did add a little spice to the mix.  Definitely will be making it again!  Thank  You!

I like it, but I love my mum's banana bread! Followed the recipe to a T didn't change a thing with the exception of cooking time, my oven runs hot. I've made this banana bread twice in 5 days... nice to snack on, with a nice cup of tea/coffee.

This is an EXCELLENT banana bread recipe. Very moist and great flavor. I made one adjustment though. I didn't have any chocolate chips but I did have WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS. It made for a nice change. Thank you for this recipe, Chef John!

I used this recipe as a basis for a healthier, vegan mini-muffins. Substitutions: 1/2C butter for 1/4C melted coconut oil and 1/4C applesauce. Use refined coconut oil; it can handle baking temps. 2 eggs for 1T EnerG egg replacement (which is just potato starch, btw) mixed with a 1/4C water.  all white sugar for half brown, half white sugar (might want to check that the sugar is vegan; some sugars are processed with animal bones).  full teaspoon of vanilla. chocolate chips for diced date pieces. (70%+ dark chocolate chips are vegan, but I just wanted something healthier). white flour for half bread flour, half whole wheat flour. I think that last substitution REALLY knocked it out of the park! Delicious! The batter made 24 mini muffins plus 3 big muffins. (I only have one mini muffin pan, and I'm impatient!) 340 degree oven. minis were done after about 17-18 minutes, and big ones were done after 25. I should note that I like it on the softer side, so adjust timing for your taste.

This has become my usual go-to banana bread recipe. Just needs more vanilla extract.

This Banana Bread is the best recipe I have ever used. I had the reputation of the worst baker in our family until I found this recipe and followed Chef John's instruction to the tee and lo and behold a baking genius was born! Thank-you for helping me go from worst to first! This Bread is delicious, moist, and become a favorite. My husband leaves 3 bananas in the fruit bowl so they ripen and hopes I get the hint that it is time for more banana bread!!

Followed this one to the letter with the exception of using 1/2 the amount of walnuts. Baked it in my grandma's old aluminum pan like I do all my quick breads.  I baked it for the time called for which was a mistake.  Definitely monitor this one closely especially if using a pan that holds heat like stoneware. This turned out on the dry side and I've never made a dry banana bread in my life. Oven temp was correct per my thermometer. Not my favorite by far.

I made a double batch of this banana bread as written for the first loaf, omitting the cinnamon in the second, by mistake but using gluten free all purpose flour. My family liked it and my husband gave it 4.5 stars. I thought it was ok, but there are better recipes for banana bread here on Allrecipes.

I did substitute coconut for a portion of the oil the recipe called for and, lightly greased the pan with same. I'm not a huge "nut" lover, so didn't add those, but did use chocolate chunks.... I have bananas readying to make this again as soon as!

I followed the recipe to a T. It was very good. The only thing I would change was the baking time. I would decrease the time by 10 minutes.

Five star recipe—all other problems were strictly "user error" on my part. I followed the recipe exactly—sans walnuts and chocolate. This turned out amazing despite my screwing it up royally by using cold butter, cold eggs, and room temperature bananas. I guess I was in a hurry and thought those bananas weren't going to survive just one more hour. Next time, I'll try to remember, "all similar-temperature ingredients". Incorporating the dry ingredients into my curdled and granular cold wet ingredients "disaster" required stirring a bit more than usual. I knew I was going to get surface cracking when the bread baked. I made the best of it by sprinkling granulated sugar over the top of the batter in the pans before baking (I used two smallish disposable foil loaf pans). If there was going to be cracking it was going to at least be sparkly shiny cracking! The end result was wonderful. I cooked the loaves to an internal temperature of 200ºF and the banana bread was very moist, tender, and held together very well when cut—in spite of my screw ups. The extra sugar I put on top gave the crust a bit of a satisfying crunch as well. Truly magical. I keep finding excuses to go into the kitchen and sneak another slice!

Chef John's banana bread was delicious!!  I used the mini chocolate chips and that was the only change I made.  I like the mini's for breads and muffins!  It made a very nice size loaf that came up high.   I always set a timer ahead of the recipe baking time.  I set my timer for an hour and it needed a bit more to go.  I set it for 7 minutes more and it was very done.  It did brown nicely but next time I'll check it at an hour and 5 min.  It was very moist.  Obviously all ovens vary.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you Chef John for sharing your recipes!  I have made a lot of your recipes and haven't been disappointed!  :)

Very easy to make! I turned it into a multi-grain chocolate chip banana bread by having half the four made out of Rye and Millet. I accidentally melted the butter before adding it to the mix, yet it turned out pretty great! It ended up being denser than normal banana bread but tasty nevertheless.

I followed the recipe except for a few changes. Instead of using 1/2 cup of butter, I used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of greek yogurt.  Also, I used egg beaters instead of real eggs. It was still delicious with a little less fat.

good easy recipe.  i've made this several times and use various nuts besides walnuts (currently i'm using chopped almonds) and adding in other flavoring agents like: peanut butter, coffee, pumpkin spice chips, butterscotch chips which all depend on the inventory on hand.  if you make just like written you will like it, but as mentioned, you can easily make it your own.

This recipe is easy to follow and idiot-proof! I havent baked in ages but the banana bread turned out awesome! It's better to use a deeper tin than a shallow one though. Could probably bake for just about an hour. :) best banana bread ever.

Sub'd pecans for walnuts and used bittersweet chocolate  morsels.  When I take it from the oven I like to use a wooden skewer to poke holes all over and then baste it with butter and sprinkle with lightly toasted wheat germ.  I've made this before and this certainly won't be the last time.  Everybody just loves it!

I made the recipe with a few shortcuts and changes. I didn't have eggs so I used a mixture of 1 Tbsp chia seeds and 3 Tbsp water for each egg. I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/3 cup chocolate chips but no nuts. I also used melted butter instead of softened butter. The banana bread was ready in 40 minutes rather than 1hr 10. It would have been very dry if I left it in the oven for longer. The resulting banana bread was good, had crisp edges, and held its shape. I wish it were more moist though.

Made this yesterday. Only changes I made was using Splenda rather than sugar (I'm diabetic); and pecans rather than walnuts, plus I added cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger as recommended by other reviewers.  this is NOT a great banana bread. Not much banana flavour....& it's too dry.  Made a large loaf tho!

Made this exactly as written and my family (who will NOT eat bananas) loved it! The only complaint from my kids was it needed more chocolate chips.  This bread was light and moist without being so thick and heavy as other banana breads I have tried. This definitely going into my rotation.

Truly worth making. I also decided to make it in muffin form. cook time was more like 40 mins in my oven, after 20 they were still very uncooked. I didn't put in the chocolate chips but did use the pecans and put a tablespoon of vanilla.

I chose pecans instead of walnuts, due to a walnut allergy.  I also added just a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. The recipe was very easy and turned out well.  I had a bunch of bananas that needed used up, so I doubled the recipe and it turned out great without adjustments.  !  I would use a little extra vanilla for my taste next time.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe! I make it as is, but I do increase the vanilla to 1 tsp. I don’t use walnuts, just because my kids don’t care for them. The cooking time is dead on. I recommend using mini chocolate chips because they do not sink to the bottom of the bread as bad. They spread through out the bread a little more evenly. I’ve used both sizes and it’s great either way. I have also made it with out chocolate chips or walnuts and it still comes out great!

I made the following changes - just used 1/2 cup of walnuts. Added some cinnamon - heavy sprinkle all around the flour mixture. Added a small sprinkle of nutmeg. Made a small loaf and a revalue size loaf. The small loaf took 45 minutes, the regular size took one hour.

This was fantastic! I made 2 loaves. 1st exactly as written and excellent! 2nd as made with a few changes: gluten free baking mix, no nuts, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup coconut oil, 1 tsp vanilla and the rest unchanged. It was fabulous and moist!

The ratios were almost perfect for me. I prefer  wet almost greasy  (rarely using butter) so I added a banana. taking 1+1/4cup, to 1+ 3/4 bananas. I also tweaked the chip/nut mix,  keeping total chips at 1+1/3cups . 1/2 cup nuts was plenty for my posse, leaving a strong 3/4 cup for choc chips and in one batch; 2/3 choc and 1/3 p.but.chips. I often sprinkle the nuts on top, tapping to embedding, yet  easy  to removal for allergies or taste.  EXCELLENT, this ones a keeper!                                                                                          010

More like a banana brick, needed to moisten. The texture was grainy and dry, and the flavor was salt, because it overpowered the bread. I felt like I was eating salt bread.

This is THE best banana bread that I have ever made! I have 4 kids, 10 grandkids & 1 great-grandson. My neighbors brought over sugar & bananas so that I would make a loaf just for them. I'll never use my old recipes for this treat again

This is the recipe my mom always used. I looked everywhere for one like hers (with a lot of butter and chocolate chips) and this one fit the bill. Moist, delicious, and always gets eaten very quickly. A staple for me. The only thing I do differently is use half white sugar, half brown sugar. Just gives it a little richer flavor I think but it's probably just as good as is!

I loved every single bite (I made it into muffins). My husband, on the other hand, felt they weren't moist enough and he prefers the loaf over muffins. So, in order to please my husband I will use 4 bananas and make it into a loaf the next time around.

I love this banana bread recipe. I substituted the white flour with half whole wheat and half white. I like whole wheat denser texture better and it's healthier. I also cut down on the sugar from 1 cup of white to 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I added more bananas to compensate the reduced sugar.

It turned out great!!! Sweet enough with all the 5 very ripe bananas.  Very delicious.

I just made this bread, this is the first time trying to make Banana bread and it came out perfect, the only difference I did was add a little more vanilla extract, I added a Tablespoon but that's because I love Vanilla Extract. The bread was moist and soft and it was exactly 1 he and 10 minutes. I am so happy I will be making two more loaves for a baby reveal party this weekend.

This was awesome I used light brown sugar instead of white because I had so much on hand. It did take longer than 70 minutes to cook. I just kept adding 5-10 minutes until my chop stick came out clean. I will be making again.

I didn't change a thing. (Ok. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1/4 tsp.)  The bread came out moist and delicious.  This is my go to banana bread recipe.  Chef John never disappoints.

This bread is very tasty and moist. My husband and I both gave it 5 stars. I did make a couple of changes. I substituted some of the butter with 1/3 cup sour cream, because I had some I needed to use up. I also sprinkled in some cinnamon into the batter. I had made some candied pecan pieces and had them on hand, so I sprinkled them on the top before baking. YUM, YUM, YUM!

I've made this recipe at least 30 times, and every single time it turned out amazing. I have the recipe memorized because my family begs for it so often. The only problem is that the entire loaf is gone in 2 days. LOL!

I made this into gluten free muffins and they came out excellent! I followed the recipe exactly as is, except I used a GF flour blend and chose not to include the nuts this time. Will be making again in the next few days.

Made it dairy free - margarine, almond milk, and Enjoy Life chocolate chips. Otherwise followed directions as written and it turned out great! Family liked it and it was gone quickly.

This was great. I think the butter gives it a good flavor. I didn't use walnuts because my family doesn't like nuts and I didn't use chocolate because it didn't sound good to me.  It was still delicious. I baked for the full 1 hour and 10 min and it might have been 5 minutes too long. That all depends on your pan and oven of course.

I made a double batch and used a loaf pan as well as a square heavy duty metal pan.  Although the loaf pan is more traditional, I prefer the square pan as it cooked more evenly with the larger surface ratio.  (Just a note: the square pan finished 10 mins earlier!  Keep an eye out after an hour of baking if you use a different baking pan!)  Absolutely great recipe!

This banana bread recipe is absolutely delicious, and it's the only one I use. Everybody tells me this banana bread is  the best they've had and it never lasts more than a day!

I make this in a bundt pan and bake it for 45minutes. I use pecans instead of walnuts.

Another great Chef John recipe!  I followed the recipe as written except for letting the vanilla overflow the teaspoon. My bread reached 195 degrees in the middle at 67 minutes, and that was just right!  This will be eaten very quickly by my family!  Thanks, Chef John!

I couldn't get it to completely bake through when I tried the last time.  I used two bread pans instead...So I only filled the pans half way. I used one regular size bread pan and then a slightly smaller bread pan. I baked them ax. an hour watching and checking with a toothpick at 45 min. Yay!  it is the most scrumptious, flavorful banana bread.

This is awesome banana bread  I make it a lot - 2 at a time.  The only thing I change is adding some cinnamon and nutmeg - no chips or nuts.

This is a great bread. I left out the choc chips (I know ladies sacrilege)  I love choc but not in my banana bread. This is very Banana -ish , moist and everyone I make it for loves it. 
I wish the video worked so I could see what Chef John is saying but  I like the recipe anyway.

This is a great  recipe and the only changes I made were, increased vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp. Added a cream cheese filling which added 10 minutes to the baking time of 1 hour  and 10 minutes. Definitely will be baking another one.

I actually did make this on purpose. I felt like having banana bread. This is a great recipe, and it is very close to what my grandmother made for fifty years. I added a second tablespoon of milk however as I'd heard this recipe tended to be dry, and felt it was plenty soft and moist. The store didn't carry large loaf pans (had to get some the day I made them since I realized I didn't have any since I moved) so I made two small mini loaves. I worried they would get too overcooked and pulled them from the oven before the time was up, but they turned out fine.

I just made this recipe. Very tasty!!! I made muffins @350 for 25 min. Followed the recipe and instructions almost to a T. I had to adjust a few things. One extra banana because I had four going bad. I also added half brown sugar and half white sugar (ran out of white). Turned out amazing! thanks Chef John I can always count on your recipes.

Best banana bread recipe hands down! I've made this already 4 times and it comes out great every time. I use pecans and chocolate chunks instead of walnuts.  But followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it always turns out so yummy!

I didn't have any chocolate chips, so omitted them and used oil instead of butter but otherwise followed the recipe. The banana bread turned out very nice and tasty. Great with coffee. Will definitely make again.

I liked everything about this, but 70 min baking time was not  long enough to bake the B. bread in my oven. There was a pocket of uncooked B. Bread in the center, my fault, I should have used the tooth pick method before taking it out.

I made this  2 months ago and my family loved it. I would just leave out the chocolate chips.  It was very moist . In my family we always grill our banana bread in a skillet on both sides with a little butter. OMG so delicious! I took a pic but can't seem to attach it .

Didn't use walnuts as nobody in my family likes them. My husband says it was the best banana bread he'd ever tasted and it's simple enough for my son to make. Great recipe.

This tastes very similar to a banana bread my mother makes from a older version of the Betty Crocker recipe book. I did make a few changes to this recipe though; I upped the vanilla to 1tsp, did two handfuls of mini chocolate chips instead of larger chips and omitted nuts - my son doesn't like them - but I did add a handful of shredded coconut. I had to cook it for slightly longer as the middle was still quite doughy after the allotted time. Still turned out delicious and moist.

I've done this recipe with 1/2 cup of blueberries instead of chips and walnuts and it's also delicious this way! Right now in the oven I have a different variation with 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of chopped strawberries, and 1/4 cup of blueberries so we'll see how this turns out!

Excellent recipe. I think I used a little too much cooking spray as they're a bit wet on the outside in the cup area, but still delicious. I used broken pecans rather than walnuts, it was what I had. 
Be certain to use a large mixing bowl, 8 or more cups. I used a 6 cup bowl and it was so full I had trouble stirring in the flour without getting it all over the counter. Okay, I admit it, I got it all over the counter. 
I used unlined muffin cups, as suggested by Sarah Jo, filling them almost to the top. I was worried they'd spill over while baking, they did not. I got a full 18 muffins out of one recipe batch.

This banana bread turned out excellent. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly and used chopped pecans. Baking time was just right and now that we had a chance to eat it, I would definitely make this recipe again. Thanks Chef John!

This was my first attempt at banana bread and it turned out delicious. Since then I have made this multiple times and has been a success. I didn't add Chocolate chips though. I have also tried this recipe with combination of half of sugar and half honey and it was delish.

The only things I changed was I used glazed pecans and no chocolate chips.   I baked the loaf according to the directions and it turned out a bit dry but it has a nice taste.  I think the glazed pecans that I made beforehand made a difference,  I will try the recipe again.

I followed this recipe with the exception of one ingredient...milk. I left it out just because I didn't have any. To tell you the truth, I didn't notice that it made a difference! 
This really is a DEElicious recipe and will always be my 'go to' for banana bread....YUM!

Awesome recipe. I've made this one at least four times now. I haven't used chocolate chips as when I make this I don't have any on hand. Instead I'll chop up dried apricots in their place. Turns out awesome this way n my coworkers always ask for more. I have to hide a loaf from my kids for them.

I have made a few of Chef John's recipes and enjoyed them so when I came looking for banana bread recipes I thought I would give his version a go.
Very nice and moist!  I put in an extra banana as I had four that were black, and someone little boy creature in my house had found my chocolate chips so I had none of those left for it haha!  I will make this again for sure, and will remember to hide my chocolate chips in the veggie drawer where the boys never look ;-)

So yummy.  It's very moist, full-banana flavor, the chocolate chips are an unexpected fantastic flavor/texture burst, and walnuts keep it classic. I see no need to use a different recipe.  By personal preference I doubled the vanilla extract and reduced the sugar a bit. Made muffins and they only needed 25 mins bake time.

So excellent!! I added a whole teaspoon vanilla extract instead of 1/4 teaspoon.  I also added a dash of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I left out the chocolate chips to make it closer to the Hawaiian banana bread that I was trying to imitate.
Maybe next time I'll try this topping - mix together 2 TBLS. each finely chopped nuts and granulated sugar with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a generous dash of nutmeg. Sprinkle on batter before baking and press lightly with the back of a spoon. 
But honestly, it came out with a yummy sweet crunch to the top and sides without any added topping, and it was soft in the middle. So delicious!

It really aggregates me to read reviews where the "reviewer" actually just rewrites the whole recipe, and then talks about the NEW recipe! Anyway, I made this exactly as written, the ONLY change being that I added a full tsp of cinnamon to it. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it is delicious!! My 17 month old even ate it and THAT is nothing short of a miracle ?? Thanks for this recipe, I will make it many, many more times in the future!

Oh my gosh! This is the best banana bread ever! The only tip is that instead of using cooking spray, I use Crisco Vegetable  Shortening. Overall, this is great!

i would definitely reduce salt next time. I felt slight salty taste together with banana sweetness.  By the way, I omit chocolate chips from this recipe, coz my child doesn't like chocolate.  If I have used chocolate chips, it could have been more sweeter,  I guess.

This is just insanely good!!!  Used old bananas that I kept in the freezer and mini chocolate chips. The small amount of chocolate really does add subtle magic to this bread.

Anytime I need a recipe and see that Chef J has what I need, my search is over. And once again, it's amazing! I love this banana bread! I wanted a recipe that used at least 3 banana's and all the ingredients were on hand.  It's quick, easy and delicious! I did not add the chocolate chips or nuts though. Next time!

This is my go to banana bread recipe. I usually cut the sugar by half and use either walnuts or pecans depending on what I have in the pantry. I also add 1/2 chocolate chips instead 1/3 to make up for sugar I leave out. This recipe works great for muffins as well.

I've tried about 4 recipes here and so far I find this recipe results in the best tasting banana bread, it's moist, and has the best texture. It's not too floury like some of the others and you get a strong banana flavor. The only thing I find I have to adjust is the sugar, it seems to need more to be sweet enough for us, even with very ripe bananas. Also I add a little nutmeg. My family loves it. Thanks!

I don't bake that often, except for cornbread, and the occasional chess pie, bundt cake, or brownies.

This was my first banana bread and it was excellent.  Every Chef John recipe I have tried has been outstanding.

I love Chef John's recipes and rarely need to tweak them in any way, but I simply could not make banana bread without adding cinnamon! lol So I did throw in a teaspoon and for good measure, I grated in some fresh nutmeg (love that stuff!). Beyond that my only other changes were to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, I upped the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and to lighten it up a bit I used unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter (I do this in almost all of my baking recipes). So yummy, moist and delicious!!!

The first time I made this  bread (as per recipe) I thought it was a little dry.   Here are the changes I made to suit us.   I reduced the flour to  1 3/4 cups and used a very full cup of bananas.   Rather than the milk I subtituted yoghurt (or sour cream).   Very happy with the end result but also I usually find I need to reduce our flour here by a few tablespoon.  Guess it is a slightly different one. Thanks for an excellent recipe just had to make a few changes for us.

I thought this was good. It reminded me of a mix between banana bread and a lunch box snack cake with the choc chips and walnuts. I followed the recipe exactly, only using mini choc chips. I only wish it was a little lower in calories. I wanted to try this though the first time as is. It is dense and yet very moist as others suggested. Despite the nuts and choc it is still heavy on banana flavor.

This banana bread is perfect without any changes. I also love how it instructs you to add ingredients in a particular way to avoid over-mixing. The end result is delicious, moist, and dense.

This is a great recipe and very simple to make. I did substitute Splenda for the sugar and also unsweetened applesauce for the butter. Still really yummy I didn't use 1 cup of nuts, added 1/2 cup instead and since I had no walnuts (not my favourite) I used pecans. Oh, and I added about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I simply mixed the wet ingredients really well with a wire whisk. Then I folded in the rest of the ingredients till moistened. Everything else was the same as the recipe. My oven is fast and so it cooked in 50 minutes. I will definitely make this again. There is a marvelous banana cake recipe in All Recipes that is very light and tasty. Check it out if you haven't already. I believe that it is called Banana Cake vi

I had to have done something wrong. Instead of banana nut bread, I ended up with banana nut "brick". Looked more like fudge than bread.

Loved the recipe, John.
Only thing I would say to "aspiring" young cooks.....don't let the phony mystique about blending the eggs in "one at a time"......etc, etc.
Whatever!!
It's all becoming a big MASHUP anyway. I've made this recipe 5 times and it makes no difference what sequence the "wet stuff" goes in with. Toss it all in and get that mixer goin', honey!

Perfect with coffee/tea. Doubled recipe and used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet chips, used 1/2 walnuts & 1/2 pepitas, plus a few dashes of cinnamon. Yum.

This bread was ok. I found it to be a little on the dry side even though I didn't cook it as long as it said. I think I might try another recipe to see if I can find one that is a little more moist.

Exceptionally moist and holds together like a dream. I leave out the walnuts as my house is not a fan, but the chocolate chips add a lovely element. I have thrown in some spices, namely nutmeg and cinnamon, to vary the flavor and color. And if you run short on bananas, I have substituted part of the banana mash for peeled mashed pear. It gives it a bit of a different taste profile, and used up my pears that were too mushy to eat otherwise!

Chef John I have been making banana bread for over 50 years and have loved every bite and gave it to those who love it as much as I do. So I took a look to see what trick you might have because I do love your style.
I must now endeavor to apologize to everyone who ever tasted the "other" breads! This is the best I have ever eaten, whether my recipe or theirs! Just awesome.
The devil made me do it but I had to do a "tweek' I added a few more chips and a bit of sour cream. .Not that it is a must because there seemed no suggestion of it in the finished product.
Thank You again!

The banana bread turned out so good. Since my husband and I are trying to reduce our sugar intake, I reduced the butter to ¼ cup and added heart healthy items such as ground flax seeds, raisin, almond and carrot paste. It turned out fantastic and moist.

I make this ALL the time and follow it to a T! well, except I don't add chocolate chips because I don't like them in breads :) BUT, nonetheless it's straightforward and people always ask for the recipe! I watched his quick video on mixing too and will never over mix again!

Seriously best banana bread EVER!!!! I have made many and none compare to this recipe. The only thing I do different is no nuts, I don't think it needs it. People that I make this bread for are always asking for the recipe...I have probably shared this recipe over 20+ times.

It was excellent.  My mom makes a great banana bread and this rivals her's.  My wife made this and I'm very grateful.  We will be sharing this with our "foodie" friends.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up some going bad bananas. This bread turned out great!  I left out the walnuts, chocolate chips, used organic sugar, substituted a half cup of all purpose for whole wheat flour and it tastes wonderful.

OMG, it was awesome!!! My 8yr old watched the recipe in video and then whip it up with me.  She really wanted chocolate bread, So, I have sub. in 1/4 cup of flour with cocoa powder.  I didn't have chocolate chip and just chopped in the semi-sweet ghirardelli square chocolate.  Definitely need the full 1 hr and 10 mins.  I took it out 5 mins early and the middle part has a brownie texture. Still taste amazing.  DD sprinkle some sugar on top of the loaf and it was so crunchy good!

OMG! This is so good. It was gone in 24 hours. I did have one problem. After an hour I checked it and it was over done on the outside, but it was not done on the inside. I put it back in for 10 more minutes and the inside was done. I almost wonder if just turning down the oven to 300 would solve that problem. This is my go to recipe for banana bread now! I left out the walnuts and added one cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.

This recipe turned out great!  I doubled the recipe.  I did add a sprinkle of nutmeg and allspice and about 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Didn't use nuts but added a bit more chocolate chips.  Turned out great.

The batter looked great and it smelled amazing while it was cooking. We were very excited. In the end it was a bit dry. I did not over cook it, I was very careful about that. I did exclude the chocolate chips because I didn't have any on hand. Nevertheless, I was let down a little by this recipe. Not terrible though, just dry.

I didn't add the nuts or chocolate chips but added cinnamon and allspice. Also, I had 4 bananas so increased the other ingredients a but and made 2 loaves. I pureed the banana into the butter and sugar with my immersion blender and it turned out great. I topped the bread with cinnamon sugar which added a nice sweet crunch. The bread is so moist, easy to make, and delicious!

I did this recipe many times always a success. I was just a little bit concerned about the amount of sugar so I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup instead of 1 cup and it turned out really great!

This is the best banana bread recipe EVER! I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and maybe 3 and 1/2 bananas. (My 2 year old was in charge of peeling and putting the bananas in a bowl, but when I looked back at her she was eating one. I added the 1/2 banana to make sure I covered what she ate.) I left out the nuts and chocolate chips...but not one missed them because this is SO GOOD! Follow Chef John's video and you will make it perfect every time!

I followed the instructions exactly except for the addition of one tsp vanilla per loaf since I doubled the recipe. For the reviewers who pronounced the bread too dry, 3 things come to mind: the size of eggs matters; Lg or XLg are needed; make sure your butter is room temperature, eggs also. Don't add all the flour at once to the wet ingredients, stir in 1/3 to 1/2 C at a time.  My family loves the bread, proclaiming it delicious

This is the best receive I've made yet!!! 
Can't seem to keep it in the house---got two in the oven  right now
I added a little bit more vanilla, since my family don't care for chocolate chips I cheated and added some white chocolate chips,raisins( pre-soaked in hot water---plumps them up I think??)and walnut and taffee bits----after all that---still got a moist and so  delish banana bread.
My guys are really fussy so one has to try and stay on top of things especially when your son is a chef??
Big props and many thanks to you Chef John!

Watch Chef John's video, worth it. Like many people, I made changes to the recipe for healthy(er) choices. Plant based vs man created junk IMO
I used Organic Coconut Oil Carrington Farms(Costco)Solid form instead of Butter 
Almond Milk instead of Dairy Milk
Truvia Baking Blend Sugar 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup regular sugar
The batter seemed to be a little bit thicker which may have to do with the coconut oil and Truvia changes. I folded in the dry ingredients just until incorporated. Didn't over stir.
It looks, raises well in the middle, not a flat top loaf at all, and smells just like regular Banana Bread and tastes incredible. I'd say at least as good as the recipe without the changes, since I've had both kinds. Used 3 normal (about 3/4-1c) banana's and stayed with the same amounts on all the other ingredients and folded in the flour mixture.Baked in my Breville Convection Toaster Oven. I'll report back when my husband tastes it. 
Saved 30mg cholesterol/serving, 75% less sugar calories and lactose free. Hope this helps others who didn't want to take the plunge. It's really an excellent option and you aren't suffering on taste and texture. Something I learned a long time ago was if you don't like the splitting in the loaf, run a knife down the top middle of the batter, to avoid the typical splitting.

After watching Chef John's video, made it and it was delicious!  Came together very easily; couldn't wait until it came out of the oven at 9:45 p.m.  This is definitely a 'keeper'!  I e-mailed recipe plus photo I took on my phone to my daughter to try out.  NancyT418

I used canola oil instead of butter and still was very moist and tasty. I did butter the pan which gave it a nice crust! Went along with the cinnamon idea and agree with others on this. Also will use half the salt next time.

This is the first time I've ever made banana bread and wow so easy and so good! Made them into muffins instead of bread and ended up with 17 regular sized ones. Definitely a keeper!

We really enjoyed this bread! It was easy to make but came out very moist and flavorful. The only diversion made from the original recipe was that I used 3 mini-loaf pans instead of one large loaf pan. I baked the minis for approx. 35 min. at 325.

This is an excellent recipe! I made 12 muffins (baked for 22 minutes) instead of a loaf of bread. I also used 4 frozen bananas which I thawed and then drained off liquid from before mashing. Texture, flavor, everything was perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

Great simple recipe. Makes an easy robust base to alter as you as much as you like. I usually replace a cup of the flour with a cup of rolled oats or quick oats cereal, reduce sugar to a quarter cup and throw in a handful of sultanas or dried cranberries. it's nice if you sprinkle a few teaspoons of crushed walnuts a pinches of brown sugar for the top. You can also use halve the amount of butter and replace with low-fat plain yoghurt as well. This makes it a healthier, yet still delicious breakfast!

You've done it again, Chef John. This was the first banana bread I've ever made in my life and it was SO MUCH BETTER than anything I've ever eaten from anyone else! The only thing I changed was increasing the vanilla to a full tsp. Or was it a tbs? I don't know, I just slopped it in there. I like my strong vanilla flavor! It was fantastic! Will make again, and again, and again, and share with friends.

The key to this bread is not over-mixing.  So glad to see a recipe that shows how to make this without a mixer!  It is almost impossible to ruin this recipe, in my opinion.One thing I will add:  I don't mash my bananas:  I press through them one time with the tines of a fork.  I like biting into actual bits of banana.  And, don't shoot me chef--I simplify further by using self-rising flour.

This was great!  I like it because it was not too sweet like some I have baked before.  I live at a high altitude and I did not have to change any of the ingredient measurements.  I also used cake flour.  I was out of walnuts and chocolate chips but needed to cook the bananas I had and it was great without them.  Nice warm with butter.

That's what I'm talking about,Chef John! This is THE Banana bread recipe I have been looking high and low for. I could never seem to find the right one and here it is. I've made it twice and it's already written on my heart, so so delicious! It satisfies my sweet tooth and my husbands semi sweet tooth. Definitely don't leave out the nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger;I mixed it in with the flour mixture. I don't know what it tastes like without it but its perfection with it. Fits my large loaf pan like it was made for this bread. All I can say is get ready to make 2 or 3 or 4 because they go quick!

Excellent recipe !!! I do some adjustments though ... I add a little more vanilla and have done variations with 1/2 white/semi-sweet chips and coconut flakes.  I've also cut the recipe in half when I only had one banana but I think you can't make this with less than 2 as you don't really have enough banana flavor otherwise.

Made it once without walnuts, for tomorrow breakfast I will add them and I'm sure it will be even better than the first time. I rarely prepare the same recipe or dish, since I like to try always new things, but I loved this one! Thanks Chef John!!

Chef John is right. Get rid of your existing recipe and use this one. Lightly warm the slice in the toaster, slather with butter and sit back and watch your stomach expand...

This is the BOMB!

Absolutely the best Banana Bread recipe, and I have tried many! Moist, flavorful and my hubby's favorite snack bread.   I omit the nuts and chocolate as I can't have either, but it is still awesome. I make this often.  Nummy, nummy, nummy!

Made this today, using pecans and dark chocolate chips instead.  I liked it, but can't say I loved it.  I know it's a bread rather than a cake, but it could have been a little sweeter.  Other than that, I may try to make it again with modifications.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did not put any walnuts, and I added cinnamon.  It tasted great when it was first baked last night, but after I stored it in the refrigerator and ate some today, it seemed really dense.  I wasn't a fan of the texture...

Absolutely delicious, went without the walnuts but made sure to keep in the chocolate which added that extra spunk of flavor.  It was the perfect, moist and yummiest banana bread. Will make again!

Great!!! Everything about it is wonderful; from the taste to the texture even to the 'oooold tuppatuppa'. It is so easy to make too! If you follow the video instructions you can't go wrong. My husband has instructed that there is always a chef John's banana bread in the house. I use peanuts instead of the walnuts.
Thank you Chef John.

Moist, flavorful & did not fall apart when sliced. I subbed whole wheat pastry flour for the white & reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. This is the best recipe I have found & tastes like my grandma's banana bread.

Nice and moist with great flavor!! I followed the recipe but left out the chocolate and used pecans. The timing is spot on at an hour and 10 minutes! I think I have finally found a nice banana bread to stick with! Thank you, Chef John!

Just made this recipe (minus the chocolate and quite a bit more vanilla--probably a total of 3/4 Tbsp vanilla) as muffins.  Made 12 regular muffins in paper liners, and the remaining 3 in a sprayed muffin pan. I filled each muffin cup almost completely, and they all ended up having a nice, puffy dome on top. All came out beautifully after 25-30 min (sorry I'm not exactly sure!).  I immediately ate one that came out of the sprayed pan and it was DELISH!!  This was so easy to make and I definitely will be making these over and over again.

This is seriously the best Banana Bread I have ever made/had.  My wife and I devoured the whole loaf in one day.  I used pecan pieces because I did not have walnuts and they were just as good.  The chocolate chips give it that little sweetness that you crave.  And there is TONS of banana flavour.  Excellent!!!!!

Great tasting banana bread ! I followed it exactly, except that I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp. Will make this again, but 1 hr 10 min wasn't quite enough. Next time, I'll let it bake for another 5 min.

This Banana Bread Recipe turns out YUM every single time I make it.  I have made it for my family and friends and they have absolutely loved it! The only change I made was instead of using white sugar, I used brown.  It was polished off within minutes, I will definitely make these again!

I finally made this bread and it turned out great!  The only thing is I had to cook it for 1 hr and 30 minutes which kind of concerned me cause I thought it would get to hard, but it didn't.  I creamed the butter and sugar with a mixer, but i did every thing else by hand.  I think that is key, so you don't over mix the dry ingredients.  I made this for my Fire Station and the bubbas loved it.

Easy and delicious!  I made 14 good-sized muffins with this recipe.  I omitted the walnuts (my son won't eat them) and sprinkled tourbinado sugar on top prior to baking.  I'll definitely make this again - thank you for a great recipe!

Made a double batch and followed it to a tee.  My husband and co-workers just loved it.  Everyone said it actually tasted like banana bread not just bread they've tasted from other recipes.  I am making it again today..thanks for the great recipe Chef John. It's definitely a keeper in my recipe box

Awesome recipe.  The handful of chocolate chips moisten the bread just enough but do not overwhelm the banana flavor.  I tried to speed up the cooking process by increasing the oven temperature to 350.  The bread was a little dry in the crusty ends. I would stick to the 325 cooking temperature and be patient next time.

Banana bread was ready in 60 minutes.  Let it cool, in the pan first
for about 20 minutes, then transferred bread to a cooling rack, and
let it cool for about another 45 minutes.  When I cut off a slice,
found the bread to be a little on the crumbly side, so I wrapped it
in foil, and put it in the fridge overnight.  When slicing it the
next day, it was no longer crumbly.  Overall, I would say this banana
bread recipe has good flavor, but is a little on the dry said.  I'm
going to try some other banana bread recipes that use more liquid.  I
did like the idea of using a small amount of chocolate to make the
bread richer.

I gave this recipe five stars because of the balance of ingredients. However, I am gluten-free, so this means that the whole grain flours that I use are more dense and require additional baking time if one uses only one tablespoon of milk. Like Sarah Jo, I exchanged the walnuts for pecans. Finally, I am doing a test kitchen using this recipe for substitution of different fruit flavors. Please stay tuned. So, following are my changes for gluten-free banana bread:
1.5 (1 1/2) cup Organic Oat Flour;
.5 (1/2) cup of Organic Coconut Flour;
1.0 cup Organic Pure Cane Sugar OR .75 (3/4) cup packed Organic Light Brown Sugar;
1.0 cup chopped Pecans;
1.0 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract
.75 (3/4) cup Almond Milk;
No Chocolate Chips (they overpower banana flavor)
ALTERNATE ADDING FLOUR AND MILK UNTIL BATTER IS SLIGHTLY STIFF (YOU MAY HAVE A SMIDGE OF MILK REMAINING IN CUP). REDUCE BAKING TEMPERATURE TO 325F AND REDUCE BAKE TIME TO 50 MINUTES. CHECK BREAD WITH SKEWER AT 45 MINUTES. Enjoy gluten-free banana bread!

Lovely Banana Bread - this has become my go-to recipe.  The one thing to be aware of.  If you are using a glass loaf pan watch your baking time.  I have a convection oven with a Bread bake setting and also use a glass loaf pan.  Oven temp 325. Bake for 1 hr.  This Banana Bread comes out perfect every time.  What makes this Banana Bread so delicious is the butter!

This was a great, simple banana bread recipe for those last few bananas in the house.  I found that it was a tad too dry and think the recipe called for a little too much salt.  Next time I will use a little more milk and half the salt.  Other than that it was excellent!

Perfect ! Comes out exact ! I didn't use the nuts this time and it just as good. The chocolate chips give it an extra yum without tasting too chocolatey (is there even such a thing). Thank you. Keeper !!!

I have been using this same basic recipe(without the nuts or chocolate chips) for the last 35 years, although I do use a full teaspoon of vanilla. Nearly everyone who tries it asks me for the recipe and I'm glad to oblige! It's good with walnuts, but I like it better with pecans. Try it with cinnamon chips, yum!

I've been looking for a great banana bread recipe, as my other recipe is more of a banana cake. This is a great recipe to follow for a more bread like consistency. I added an extra banana and up'ed the choco-chips to about 3/4 cups. Delicious!

First time making banana bread. I read some other recipes and decided to use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also cut the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1TBls( that's right) of cinnamon. Absolutely fabulous!!!! Nice and moist.

This is my go to recipe for banana bread. It's wonderful if baked as written but the beauty of it is that you can add or remove ingredients as you wish and it will taste amazing. Check out Chef John's video recipe on how he makes this, makes a world of difference!

A tad too dry for me....just not moist enough....I did use splenda instead of sugar...not sure if that was the issue. Thanks!

Great recipe and super easy.  Watched Chef John's video "how to" for this and followed it.  Super recipe -- didn't change anything!  Thanks Chef John.  Keep the recipes and cooking and baking hints coming.

Really good and simple. I omitted the walnuts as I am notoriously known for not having walnuts in my kitchen, but I substituted the walnuts with more chocolate chips.

This was good. Cooked beautifully. Moist, but not as moist as the Extreme Banana Nut Bread recipe I tried. I think the secret is: more bananas = more moistness. Still, this makes an excellent presentation and is super easy to make!

Very good! I made two batches and used one for bread and one for large muffins. The muffins were gone in no time, they are easy to grab and go. Will be making this again!
