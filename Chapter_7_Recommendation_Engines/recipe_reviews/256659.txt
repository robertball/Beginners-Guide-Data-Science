1.9.17   This is a really quick, easy, and tasty soup.  I did add more of all the spices, but I think that’s just personal taste and an adjustment that anybody would make.  Used great northern beans and loved the soup’s creaminess, even when made with skim milk.  Plan to serve for dinner this evening with a double decker turkey club sandwich.  AishaSahar, we enjoyed your soup!

I love white beans and chile of any kind, i made the recipe as written, didnt care for it at all, it was like gravy on top of beans, very bland for my liking and couldnt hardly taste the green chile's at all, wife tried one spoonful and made herself a sandwich. loved the idea and double checked my measurements but no such luck as to why it was so bad.

I made this tonight.  it was a quick and easy soup to make.  The flavor was good.  it seemed a little things so next time I might pure half of the beans to thicken it up.  I had to use great northern beans because that is what u had available to me. overall it was good, just a little thin in my opinion.
