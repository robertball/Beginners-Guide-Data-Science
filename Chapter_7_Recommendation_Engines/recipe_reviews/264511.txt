Loved this! I knew 1/3 cup of mint was too much for our liking so I scaled that in half. Next time I will scale back on the parsley too. This was so fresh and healthy tasting and it is one I highly recommend. You might just want to scale back on the herbs so that the cauliflower is the star.

I left out the mint, added some diced cucumber and some Cumin.
