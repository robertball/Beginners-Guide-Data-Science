I have been using recipes from this website for many years and find most of them fantastic.  I have never reviewed any recipes before but found I had to with this one.  I am on weight watchers and made this for Easter. With the use of the asaparagus it is almost point free.   It is great, my family was unable to tell that it was asparagus and loved it.  Will definately being making this again.  Thanks Cheryl.

Made the recipe  because I had so much fresh asparagus out of the garden and I had the rest of ingredients.  Wow!  Love it! Nice fresh flavor and my picky men liked it! They like avocado guacamole so I figured I was safe calling it a veggie dip cause they will not eat asparagus. I would never have thought to do this with asparagus.  Also, the neat thing about this recipe, you can work with what you have on hand and even add sourcream to make it richer if you like. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

GREAT recipe for making something low-fat and very delicious. I do recommend using a lot more lime juice, I use one or two whole fresh squeezed limes. Also, red onion gives it more flavor and kick than green, but that's just personal preference. Thanks for sharing this, love it!

My family loved this. Being from Southern California we eat lots of Mexican foods and Guacamole is a must have. Made the recipe as is but found the end resulting color alittle gray I think maybe I over cooked the asparagus. Also the mouth feel was not buttery like avacado. So I had some frozen peas, cooked for a few minutes and threw them in the food processor with a bit of EVOO took care of the color and added richness without blowing the calorie count.

Tasted like baby food :( Got a little better the more hot sauce I added, but wouldn't make again.

Great recipe!  Brought it in to work to share and everyone loved it.  Will be making this again and again.  I added one more tomato to the mix to make it a little more chunky, but other than that, I followed it exactly.  Great as a dip or perfect for use in Mexican dishes as it helps cut back the calorie and fat content!

This was amazing!  Incredible how much like guacamole it is... however, the consistency is a little different.  I highly recommend.

Wow! I had this recipe show up in my daily email, and was SO excited! I have a strong intolerance for avocados (to my dismay) and thought I'd never be able to enjoy guacamole again. :( I haven't actually made this yet, but I can't wait to try it. Finally, I can make my guacamole, and eat it too! I'll let you know what I think when I do make it. I'm off to buy asparagus!

Excellent! I think I will add more lime juice.  I love the fresh cilantro taste.  This tastes more like an asparagus salsa (to me) than a guacamole.  At any rate I love it!  Thanks!!!

Wow! I'd never thought of making a 'guacamole' with asparagus. Needless to say, this recipe is definately a keeper. Loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I love this!! The asparagus tasted great! I actually added a little bit extra green-hot sauce to make it a bit more spicy.

This was pretty good! I still prefer avocado guacamole, but this is absolutely a nice substitute. After following the recipe's measurements, I found it was just a little bland for my taste, so I added more tomato, garlic, s&p, and Worcestershire sauce. Oh, and the only Greek yogurt I had was honey vanilla flavor, so I didn't use that! Instead I used mayonnaise, since that was the closest sub I had. And I used maybe 2-3 Tbs. I'm sure sour cream could also work. Overall, thumbs up!

Great for a low fat dip, but not tasty enough for guests in my opinion.   Taste was okay - but texture was not like guacamole.  Plus, I made the day before, and by the time I served it, it had taken on a yellow/greay/brownish colour that did not look appetizing.

This recipe is AMAZING.  I rated this a 4 only because I omitted the jalepeno pepper and the hot pepper sauce because I can't do too much spice.  I ate it with some Pita bread and I also put it over some burritos.  This is definetly a keeper!!

Very good, however I used my own guac recipe with the asparagus. I might try adding some ground pumpkin seeds to the mixture next time to give it a more "nutty" taste, like avocados have

New recipe for me. I added green beans, 1/2 can of spicy red pepper cut stewed tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes. 1 whole lime juice. 3 tbs Frank's hot sauce. 1/4 low fat cup sour cream.

This was better than I expected, particularly after it sat for a while. It wouldn't be terrible at a party, where lots of people were each eating a little of it, but with just the two of us we didn't make much of a dent. It's missing the smoothness of real guacamole, of course. I added some onion salt.

Made just as written and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I might decrease the oils next time and perhaps try toasted cashews.

Strange and lovely twist on guacamole. I found asparagus on sale super cheap and made a ton of this to freeze. Turned out great even after thawing from weeks in the freezer! Fun and fresh tasting guac alternative. 
Thank you!

Being allergic to avocados, in which I love, this recipe ROCKED! Thank you for this recipe! My husband likes it, too, he didn't know it was asparagus until I told him!

This was amazing, especially for someone counting calories and carbs.
