This is an excellent soup for a rainy day. I suggest reserving more cut cauliflower to add to the soup after blending.

This is absolutely delicious. The size of the cauliflower head in proportion to the amount of Stilton is important, as it's easy for the cheese flavor to be overpowered (which you really don't want to happen with an ingredient that expensive). Some recipes for this use heavy cream, which of course, is always good. I ate this with fresh homemade bread;a perfect meal.

I think this is the best recipe i've found for cauliflower and blue cheese.  I used approx. 1kg cauliflower head (before the leaves and stalk were removed) and as stilton was sold out in my supermarket this evening, i used 150g castello blue, which isn't as crumbly - but has the same mild creamy taste as blue stilton.  (I'm going to experiment with Danish blue next time) ;)  I also used a little less pepper (I crushed 1 tsp of white and 1 tsp of black pepper corns, and used about 3/4 of the total).  The sherry addition really adds to the taste. :)  Will definitely be reusing this one. :)

update: okay, i've since tried this with stilton which i find just isn't strong tasting enough, and also with danish blue - which turned out to be the exact flavour  i was looking for. :)  so if you're a blue cheese lover, danish blue's your man! :)

This is a very luxurious soup- it's rich enough to stand alone for dinner.  Be forewarned though, that if you haven't been professionally trained in culinary school, the prep time will probably take a bit longer than 15 minutes, so plan ahead!

Oh how I hate being the black sheep. We thought this was mediocore. Even though I added almost twice as much cheese than called for, it still seemed rather bland, so I added more spices including cayenne. Actually the person I thought would not even touch it was our oldest daughter, as she does not like any kind of blue cheese, however, I didn't tell her was was in this soup and she thought it was pretty good.

This was very good. I made several ,only because I did'nt have the items on hand.Used shallots,omitted the leeks.Used 1 cup of half and half.Also used four slices of smoked Fontina cheese,which really added to the flavor. I also just mashed the cauliflower and potato right in the pot,so much easier,I like my soup with a little texture.

I made the soup strictly by the recipe. After all ingredients were cooking, I decided that I wanted the soup a little creamier. I added another 1/2 c. of heavy cream. This is a really great recipe, for soup lovers.
thanks,

Ken

Such a great, luxurious soup.  I used butter instead of vegetable oil and cooked everything up together then pureed 2/3 of the soup and hand mashed the rest using a potato masher and finally jused used half and half instead of the heavy cream and milk.  So deliciouse however if you are not a "stinky cheese" person you probably won't love it but if you're like me and think stinky cheese is the bomb then I'm pretty sure you're gonna love this.

This recipe makes a deliciously flavoured hearty soup. We were scraping our bowls. Next time I'll double the recipe. (I used a bit less of the Stilton than called for, as I find a little goes a long way, and I still wanted to taste the cauliflower.)

I wanted to give my version of this 3 1/2 stars but didn't have option. My husband says give it an 80/100 :) I used extra fingerling potatos, no leek, milk instead of cream, and danish bleu cheese. I also served with crusty bread. It was good but I thought leftovers became a bit tough to eat. Its a potent taste (probably the less smooth bleu cheese) and great in small batches.

Just made this recipe and it is truly wonderful. Only change was to exchange potato for carrot as that is what I had on hand. Next time will use potato. I will make this many times I am sure! Today is hot and sunny and it is still great! Thanks Sean for sharing.

This is good, but in small batches. The stilton is strong and a little goes a long way. I think it would be great as a side dish, but not as a main soup.

This soup was great! I used Danish Blue Cheese instead of Stilton, and it definitly had a more powerful flavour. However I found with the leftovers the next day, the blue cheese taste was much stronger so I would probably use a milder blue cheese next time. The flavour seemed to heighten!

Didn't use cauliflower for garnish. so that cut out step 1. Used 1 big onion because I didn't have a leek.Used 1 cup instant rice and 1 cup of water for the potato. Added 2 carrots cut in 1" or so chunks.  Did not use any oil, just put cauliflower through broth and carrots, peppers and salt in a soup pot. Cooked til cauliflower was tender. Removed most of it to food processor and pureed. Returned to pot and added sherry, cream and 4oz of blue cheese instead of the Stilton. Very tasty!

We love cauliflower so we were really looking forward to trying this recipe.  However, that amount of celery overwhelmed the cauliflower flavor, and the final product was way too spicy hot.  I would recommend less celery, and way less pepper!

This has become my new comfort food.  I had never tried Stilton cheese previously, and it absolutely makes the recipe.  I wouldn't suggest using blue cheese as a substitute, it doesn't work as well.  This is definitely a keeper, especially in the coming winter months.

My prep time was a little bit longer than 15 min. Also, I must of had a very large head of cauliflower because I needed more broth (used vegetable broth). I don't care for sherry, used a good dry red wine instead. Very happy with this soup, using a hand blender makes it even easier!

I have served this soup to several groups of people and all rave about it.  Definitely 5 stars! Be sure to use the Stilton.  I tried other cheeses thinking they would be better, but only the Stilton really gives it zip.

Found this recipe really tasteless. Extremely bland. I followed the recipe exactly, even adding worcestershire and additional spices. Would not make again.

I chose this recipe because I wanted to finish using up the cream and sherry I bought for our Christmas dinner of shrimp Newberg.  (We used to keep our sherry in the pantry for years, but learned this year it should be refrigerated after opening and used within a couple of weeks). 

I used gorgonzola instead of Stilton because the only Stilton I found in my large grocery store had cranberries in it.  They were out of parsley when I shopped, and there's not enough in my garden now, so I omitted it.

It turned out thicker than soup.  It could be a side dish served on the same plate as the main dish.  Maybe a "baking potato" is smaller than the usual potatoes we call "Idahos" and bake one per person as a side dish.

Mom and I will enjoy eating what I made according to the recipe instructions (perhaps 6 large bowls or 10 small servings), but I will not make it again because it took me so long to make.  (I'm a slow chopper).  There are other things that are tastier that I can make much more quickly.

I also forgot to mention, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added a few more cloves of garlic. This was my first attempt at a soup and found it very easy to make.

I used the Danish blue cheese. Don't use any more than the recipe states because it can over power. I did make one addition. I added a little maple smoked bacon to the recipe. The family loved it!

I think it really depends how salty the bleu cheese is, because mine was too sharp to add the salt. (the stilton wasn't available were I live, so I used a creamy danish type) I recommend waiting to spice as indicated in the directions. I had to keep adding milk and cream to mellow the flavor as I did not have more cauliflower. I also used white wine because I didn't have Sherry. One thing I definitely would do again in this recipe is to add potato flakes to the puree. I didn't have a fresh potato, and it worked rather well-without the extra work. I found this recipe to be fun. Don't bother chopping everything fine because you're going to blend it all up! I liked it.

I so looked forward to making this but was very disappointed.  Nice base for a cauliflower soup and had a nice peppery kick but although I tripled a good English Stilton I had purchased, the recipe was bland. I will use the base again but maybe cut back on the vegetables to let the cheese flavor come through.
