In my first review I said a little more kick would send it over the top, so I added 1 tsp red pepper, 2 T vinegar and some carmelized onions.   Yep, there she goes.  Over the top.

Super easy and great tasting!  I used more cranberries than the recipe called for because I love them.  This is the perfect recipe for a busy night.  Thanks Pauline!

Awesome recipe!  Very easy to make and I'm not even a big cranberry fan.  Doubled up on the sauce to have over starch.  Very kid friendly as well.

Delicious! I don't know that I've made chicken breasts that have turned out more tender than this . . . of course, that might have something to do with the fact that I splurged and got free-range chicken. Either way, yum! I might cut back on the vinegar a bit next time and add a splash of orange juice, but I'll definitely make this again. I served it with steamed peas and also Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Onions (from this  site), and the flavors blended beautifully.

This was awesome, especially the cranberry sauce!  I'm going to use the cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving from now on and maybe even use it for a crisp or pie!  It was yummy!  Followed recipe exactly and it was amazing!

All I added to the recipe was the juice from an orange.  Otherwise this is the best chicken recipe I have ever made (next time I am going to double the sauce to put in over couscous with the chicken).

Delicious - good and colourful enough for a dinner party. I didn't have any fresh cranberries so I used my left over home made cranberry sauce and eliminated the water and sugar as well as the fresh cranberries. I will definitely make this again - maybe for company next time.

This was super tasty! I was worried about adding the chicken into the "cranberry sauce" becuase at the 5 min mark it still looked more like water and cranberries, so we let it cook uncovered for a few more minutes and it definitely started to thicken up. Then we followed the recipe again from there. We also amazingly enough did not have flour and so we used bread crumbs instead, worked fine for us!

Pretty much my favorite meal right now. Made extra sauce and served over brown rice. I cook the chicken in smaller pieces to reduce cook time and allow liquid to better soak in. Soo yummy and easy.

Love this recipe!!  It's been a hit with my family and my in-laws.  We did cut the red wine vinegar in half though otherwise it's way too tangy.

I doubled the cranberries and cut back on the sugar. Served the chicken and cranberry sauce over cooked bulgar. For our personal taste, I also added red pepper flakes, caramelized onions, and a star anise pod to the sauce. I will definitely make this again

Made this tonight and served over rice.  We loved it!  I was looking for an entree recipe to use up some fresh cranberries from another recipe--this one's a keeper.  I agree with other reviewers, I'll add more cranberries next time.  Awesome!

So easy and so good. I did use 1/2 c. orange juice and 1/2 water. Served with sweet potatoes. The cranberries over the potatoes was really good. Will double the sauce next time and might even add a can of mandarin oranges to the sauce right before serving. I think it would be good with pork chops too.

I've been making this for years. My eldest daughter requests it all year long. I only want it when it cools off. Who wants to eat cranberries when it's 110? In any event this is the basic recipe I've always used- BUT, I dip the chicken in an egg wash (beaten egg, little cream) before I dredge through the flour. It's a little extra step, but the results are fantastic.

We've made this hundreds of times and will continue.  Guests have loved this, and my young son can't get enough.  Thsi is a great way to use some frozen cranberries for a unique dish.

Delicious! Probably the fastest I've seen chicken disappear from my daughter's plate in a long time!  Very easy and a nice change. Will make again for sure - may try and get the sauce to thicken up a bit more, but either way, yummy!

This is a great recipe. I've served just as written and I've served w/a little cornstarch to thicken. I have also substituted fresh plums, skinned and pitted, for the cranberries, when thickened it makes a great sauce. I also save a little sauce for when I'm cooking for one.

I thought it was great and quick to fix. LOVE IT!! I did make one change, instead of adding water, I used chicken stock for extra flavoring.

The breading came out kind of soggy and the sauce was almost burnt. I think it would be better to finish cooking the chicken in the oven and poor the cranberrie sauce/gravy on after. But, the flavors were great together.

This was really good and very easy.  I loved that I really only needed to dirty one pan!  I added some finely diced shallots and orange zest.  Tart, tangy, sweet (but not too sweet) and the sauce was good over the stuffing and carrot we had with it.  It was even better today when I ate the leftovers for lunch!

I tried this recipe because it had 5 stars and was disappointed because it was just another chicken recipe.

Super easy.  Very tasty.  I did substitute orange juice for the water & I forgot the nutmeg, but I didn't miss it.  I also used about half a bag of fresh cranberries because I had that much left over from another recipe.  I will definitely make this again & may try it with porkchops.  I may also use the juice & zest from a fresh orange.

Very good!!  My family's a "saucy" family so we're going to make it again, but with more sauce.  It was delicious on a bed of Jasmine rice!  ...and so easy to make - always a plus for me!  ...oh to add, I didn't realize that "dredging" was simply a light coating of flour.  Yes, I'm not a highly educated/experienced chef = )!
