Excellent! Easy recipe to make, I made mostly as is but added a basket of fresh white mushrooms to the garlic saute step. Cooked on high pressure for 15 mins instead of 18; used bone in chops about 3/4 inch thick (that's why I cut the time down and they were falling off the bone). Will definitely make again, good flavor, lots of gravy left over or to use on potatoes or risotto!

Awesome! I did have to adjust  just a little to what I had on hand, plus my pork chops were frozen. I didn't have wine and used chicken broth instead. Since the pork chops were frozen I didn't sear them first. And I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder.  It came out amazing! I thought the gravy smelled weird, but it tasted great. The meat literally fell off the bone (not exaggerating, I pulled a very clean bone out of the Instant Pot, and another fell off while eating).  I have never had pork chops that tender and juicy before. And from frozen solid!  I love this recipe, and I love how easy it was to adjust to what I had on hand. It was a spur of the moment "let's have pork chops" type of dinner, and this was perfect for it. Thank you!

Terrific and easy with simple ingredients. I did not use avacado oil, I used olive. I cooked 8 normal boneless chops. I didn’t change any of the recipe amounts except I used maybe a tsp more flour, I eyeballed it. I did so because I read another reviewer thought the gravy was thin. We like medium thick gravy here! I had white wine, no clue if it was dry or not but it worked well. Everything was done in the instant pot. Served with peas and mashed potatoes. Family liked it!

My family ate these up! Tender and flavorful pork chops. The only thing I added was about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture. The gravy was great on white rice, and I served it with peas. I have made plenty of pork chops with cream of mushroom soup, but these were some of the easiest and most tender. I'll be using the Instant Pot for this recipe again.

4.9.18  My chops were thick (about 1-1/4”), so I set the timer for 21 minutes.  They were still just a bit on the chewy side, but then, I believe that’s a reflection of pork chops these days.  I think sauteed mushrooms added after you’ve thickened the gravy would be a nice addition.  I used Wondra®, and my gravy was very creamy and tasty.  Nice recipe, thanks for sharing Bren.

Very good. I used olive oil instead of avocado, and added sautéed fresh mushrooms. I would make it again. Great comfort food meal.

I liked this recipe a lot.  I did use a bit of corn starch to thicken the gravy a bit more.  It was not very thick and my husband likes a gravy that is on the thicker side.  It tasted great and the pork chops could be cut with a fork.  I would add sliced mushrooms to the recipe because it think it would add a little to the gravy but I really like mushrooms in sauces.  All in all I would make this recipe again.  I think it would also work with chicken really well.

Just the dinner I was looking for! I did add some of the recommended spices, and I'm glad I did. We don't use  much salt, but when served, my wife said it needed salt. I agree. The other thing I did, was brown the chops in a skillet, as I've found that my Instant Pot in Saute mode  is always too hot on more, and not enough on less. Also, the flat bottom of the skillet just works better for sauteing. I used a  bit more cream of mushroom soup and wine, as I wanted more sauce for the mashed potatoes. I'm keeping this one in my Favorites.

Followed the recipe for the most part.  Used cream of mushroom with garlic soup, and a white Chardonnay from 2000, I found in my basement.  The chops came out perfect.  They were definitely tender and the gravy was thick enough for us.  Will freeze remaining gravy for some other time.
My husband said it tasted like a five star restaurant meal.  Will keep this recipe and use again sometime.

This went over very well with the family.  I used boneless chops for 15 minutes of pressure cook time.  During the deglazing I added sliced fresh mushrooms which I think added a ton to the flavor and texture. I didn't have quite enough wine so used chicken broth for the rest and for part of the water. Added some parsley flakes to give color and flavor. Served with mashed potatoes and green peas.  Just realized I totally forgot to add the soy sauce at the end!

This was my very first attempt  at a dish made in my Duo Plus 60 Instant Pot. It was delicious! I do not normally like pork chops because they tend to be very dry but not cooked this way. The only changes I made were using 2 - 1 inch pork chops, using chicken stock instead of white wine and adding a little salt before serving. The gravy was thicker than others had said and was perfect. I think the secret ingredient was the soy sauce at the end. It added the perfect flavor. The pork chops fell apart taking them out of the pot and were fork tender.

Delicious!  I  made this for dinner and served it with steamed broccoli and little potatoes.  I  added some additional button mushrooms Worcester sauce like an another reviewer did.  This recipe will become a dinner-time staple in our house.

Made exactly as the recipe stated and it was awesome. Super easy to prepare. I had to run an errand and my husband called to tell me I had outdone myself with this dish. I love the gravy and the pork chops were so tender. Thank you for the recipe!

Turned out great, I reduced the water to 1 cup and used 2 Tablespoons of arrowroot to thicken it at the end. I grew up eating pork chops made with cream of mushroom, making them in the instant pot is a great idea and they become really tender.

Amazing!!! I used thick cut bone-in pork chops. I omitted soy sauce and pepper, and substituted with Goya Adobo Seasoning. Since I used thick pork chops, I went a little heavy on the adobo. I upped the servings to 6, and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans sautéed in garlic and butter. Num-Num!!!

A good recipe, with some mods.  When I grill pork chops I always use Mrs dash garlic and herb on one side and onion and herb on the other, plus added some fresh ground black pepper.  This is what I did with this recipe.  I also added some sliced buttons, and mixed them onto the sauce, prior to pressure cooking.  I did follow the recommendations on coking times and found that although the thawed, non bone in, pork was tender it was also dry.  So I would recommend to do everything the same other than cooking on High  for 18 min., to cooking on Low for 25-30 minutes to see if the moisture reintroduces itself into the pork for the extended time. I find this to be true on my pellet smoker.

Very tender and moist. The gravy was kind of ho hum, little flavor, but I have 4 year old triplet grandchildren who don’t do spicy so it was perfect for them.

This was a crowd pleaser - and not a bit of it was leftover.  
I made a few minor changes, but essentially followed the steps for the instant pot cooking exactly & we enjoyed the most tender pork chops we've ever eaten.  Thank you!

This was great.  I used bone in Pork Chops and it was delicious.  The meat just fell off the bone.  One thing I did different was I took advice from someone else and put a basket of sliced mushrooms into the pot during the saute period.  
I would very much make this again.

Even my husband, who doesn't like pork chops because they are always dry, liked them.  They were not dry; they were very moist and tasty.  Actually kind of surprising since I used thin cut chops.  Will definitely make again.

The whole family loved this! I added half a small chopped  onion to the sauté. I did not use the cream of mushroom soup. I substituted chopped baby portobello mushrooms, heavy cream, and beef broth in place of water. (I had them available) I also added salt and Italian spices. Delish!!

Swapped out the soy sauce and used mushroom ketchup. Instead of just a teaspoon, used two tablespoons when simmering after adding the soup and water. After the natural pressure release and removal of chops, added a teaspoon of the ketchup when simmering the gravy. 

Also, added button mushrooms after deglazing the garlic. Someone had posted that this had little flavor to it. Froze the leftover gravy for another time.

I had thick boneless, so I used those, I added portobello mushrooms, and thickened the gravy.  It was such a big hit, I have bought more chops to make again.

Big hit! Went heavier on the garlic... because it's garlic and everyone raved! the pork chops were tender and juicy.   I think I will add this to the meal rotation.

I made exactly as written except used 6 thin bone in pork chops.  I should have adjusted the time as 18 minutes was way too long and at 15 mins waiting for it to naturally release it had not so I released.

Not seeing how this is much of a time saver as opposed to stove top. With canned soup and soy sauce I think the sodium content is higher than listed.

Great recipe. One note though,  I used 1 1/4" thick boneless pork chops (4) and they were way over cooked. To the point of being dry.  I would reduce the cook time by 5 minutes. I also had to substitute cream of chicken soup as I was out of cream of mushroom and it tasted fine, mushroom would definitely have been better though.

I thought this was a great recipe. The pork chops were fork-tender and the sauce was delicious. I think the mixture of the wine, soup, and soy sauce just combines really well with the pork juices. The only changes I made was I used slightly less water and didn't thicken it with a slurry, I just let it cook down until it was the thickness I wanted. Awesome flavor and makes the whole house smell great! Thanks for sharing!

My pork chops were boneless and almost 2" thick, so I pressure-cooked them for 25 minutes. I also added mushroom slices and some Better Than Bouillon mixture instead of the wine. I forgot the soy sauce, but it was delicious and I'll make it again.

after 28 minutes in the instant pot, 3 pork chops were still not cooked through.  So, I baked those.  the sauce was good for a week night meal, but nothing to rave about.

I added everything except I used 1 envelope of Maggi Pepper Corn sauce instead of mushroom soup + 1/2 - 1cup chicken stock and it was delicious. This was my first Instant Pot recipe and so happy I have it now!

Tasted like pork chops in bland mushroom soup. I even added extra garlic, fresh mushrooms, & thyme to the sauce, and seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder before browning. They smelled divine but after cooking turned out bland. Was very disappointed.

I made this recipe as directed, with the exception of adding fresh mushrooms to the pan after frying up the pork chops.  However- this recipe doesn't take into account the 30 minutes needed to cook the chops if doing them in the IP!!  This recipe actually took almost 1.5 hours to make as you can only cook 2 chops at a time in the 6 qt IP.  I also swapped out Wocestershire sauce for the soy sauce.  To save time on this recipe- cook the chops at one time in a big skillet on the stove.  It tasted good though- just way too much time goofing with the IP.

Excellent! Made this recipe exactly as written, except I used cream of chicken soup because my husband isn't a fan of mushrooms. The pork chops came out wonderful and the gravy was excellent! We served them with mashed potatoes and corn with a side salad. It's a quick and yummy comfort food.

Absolutely delicious!! I used thick-cut, boneless chops; substituted olive oil for avocado oil; used chicken broth instead of water with the mushroom soup; used milk instead of water in the slurry and added a tablespoon of corn starch to the slurry to help thicken the gravy.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Followed exact instructions besides using probably a tablespoon more cream of mushroom & used cornstarch instead of flower  because I read some issues with the thickness of the gravy. I also cooked it 25 min instead of 18 for more tenderness. It came out perfect and everyone finished it all! MY family loved it! Served it with mashed potatoes and sweet corn. 100% recommend.

had to make some adjustments due to my chops being smaller. Not as tender as I had hoped. Good flavor, even though the gravy was thin, even after thickening.

Very good!  I added sliced onions and mushrooms in at the saute garlic phase for a heartier gravy.  I didn't have soy sauce so I used Worchestire sauce instead.  The gravy is very thin, so be prepared to add more of a slurry than what is written if you want a thicker gravy.  This was actually my first recipe to try with my new instant pot.  It was very easy!

I've been making this recipe for years. My mother used to make it and I'm 70 years old. The less ingredients you use the better it is. I put in some fresh mushrooms, saute a little onion and garlic and don't  put any water in. Use two cans of the soup for six or more servings or one can for 2 to three servings.

I had to make a few alterations to make it gluten free but my husband really liked it.  I substituted gluten free cream of chicken soup (I'm allergic to mushrooms) and used gluten free all purpose flour for thickening.

This will now be my go to pork chop  recipe. No more dry pork chops .  The only alterations made were  I added some onion powder and dry mustard to the seasoning on the chops before searing.  So tender, falling apart. And perfect gravy! Thank you.

This is very similar to what I use to make in the oven but even better. I used thick cut chops so I up'ed my time by 3 min. and they came out so tender. Other then the change in the time I followed the recipe as written and we loved it. I will be making this version for now on.
Thanks for the recipe.

I did not make the slurry and in the process ended up with a thin, watery gravy/sauce.  I didn't need the gravy however because the pork chops were very tender and juicy!

I made the pork chop and mushroom gravy and it was wonderful.  I did not have any wine so I used chick broth in  its place.  I also used fresh mushrooms and they were wonderful.  I also used cauliflower rice which saves a lot of carbs.  Will make again soon as husband loved it.
