12.3.15   I used whole organic carrots cut into chunks and steamed them rather than boiling.  The ginger gives this a subtle kick, and once blended, the soup's texture is creamy and smooth.  Husband wasn't WOWSA about it, but I liked it a lot.  Really different, and really good

This is a nice fresh tasting soup with a subtle ginger kick. I used organic purple carrots instead of baby carrots and vegetable broth. The result is a sweet yet spicy flavour and absolutely no coconut milk taste at all. A definite addition to your soup favourites folder. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a delicious soup, nearly addictive! I increased the ginger by about another half inch and replaced the two cups of water with an extra cup of chicken stick. Itâ€™s a keeper!
