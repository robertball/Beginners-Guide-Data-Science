I've made these a few times now and still feel like the recipe needs some definite improvement. My recipe usually swaps the roll dough for biscuit dough (I like using 4 c bisquick with 1-1/2 c water and 1 tbsp sugar because it doesn't rise as much as the store bought stuff). Also, my filling is usually just 1 lb sausage (any brand, and different flavors jazz it up quite nicely), 8 scrambled eggs mixed with 2 tbsp milk, cheese (either 1-2 slices of american per calzone or about 1/2 cu shredded fiesta blend mixed into the egg and sausage) and salt and pepper to taste. Sometimes I saute a little  diced onion to add to it, too. My husband's coworkers have gone nuts over this and have resorted to demanding I make more for them =)

These were delicious, the family loved them. I made some significant changes though. Instead of using the bread dough it asked for I used a home made sweet dough recipe, and flavoured it with sweet paprika and garlic powder. Instead of using pizza sauce, I took tomato paste and added tomato juice to bring down the thickness of it and then spiced it with an italian spice mix. Also we added some banana peppers to spice it up a bit. We used spicy italian sausages and also fried some green onion in there with it. Alot of changes but these were worth it.

These were a bit disappointing. They were a bit dry and needed extra seasoning. Next time I would try brusing the tops with butter & adding some spices!
