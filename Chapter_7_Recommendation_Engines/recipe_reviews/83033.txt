With so much going on here given the artichokes, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives and Parmesan cheese, I really expected this to be bursting with flavor, particularly since I also added garlic, olive oil, and some Tuscan seasoning when I noticed the recipe was missing seasoning of any kind. We both found this tasting too strongly of artichokes and little else.

This was good and my family enjoyed it.  One change I would make is to use marinated artichokes rather than the water packed ones.  I assumed water packed when I looked over the recipe, but I think it needs the flavor of the marinated artichokes.  I'd also reserve some of the oil and possibly use more of that to add flavor.

Pretty good recipe. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used marinaded atrichike hearts ( a must, I think!) I also added lots of garlic, a little lemon juice, some EVOO, and some diced up red pepper, as well as a little blanched zuccini. It's a good basic idea, it just needed some tweeking. :)

bomb diggity G. I subbed the peppers for a 2oz jar of pimentos, and added 1/4 cup of oil/vinegar Italian dressing like the previous review suggested. Don't skimp on the cheese! Thanks!!

Pretty good, but I agree with "ChefJudy1" about using the marinated artichokes. I threw in some the the "juice" because it was a little bland although I also added onion and garlic powders. Good tho and we all enjoyed this side. Thank you!

I enjoyed this recipe but I would definitely make a few changes.  It was a bit bland.  I didn't think the boullion had enough punch to make a difference in the overall flavor.

This was extremely quick and easy to make.  Like other reviewers, I added extra cheese.  The kids loved it, and it was delicious as a cold left-over.
