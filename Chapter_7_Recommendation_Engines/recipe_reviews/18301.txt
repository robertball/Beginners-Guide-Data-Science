This is not even close to "normal quiche". If you are going to make this I would suggest adding cheese and increasing the eggs. While you are at it decrease the bread crumbs ... made as is this quiche ends up like a baked bread patty. When I took it out of the oven I picked it up by one side and placed it on a plate -- it did not fall apart!

Good stuff, I would double it the next time (I have 2 kids and husband asking for more!) and add to the time in the oven when doubling!

I wasn't sure about this recipe as most quiches I've seen contain cheese.  I've been looking for a nice seafood quiche recipe though so I tried it.  I used canned lump crab meat.  I found this recipe to be bland and the quiche was quite flat.

I was just reading one reviewers comments about the consistency of this dish being thin. I haven't made it, but just looking at the ingredients, I notice that there is no CHEESE mentioned.  I believe if there was cheese in this dish, it would have a richer consistency and flavor.  That's just my opinion, of course.

The flavor is decent, but the texture was disappointing.  It ended up very thin and a lot stuck to the bottom of the dish (even though we greased it.)  It was also on the dry side.  We added some mozzarella cheese but without much improvement. Not terrible, but there are better uses for crabmeat.

It was so easy to make and both my husband and I loved it. This will become a regular dinner!

We enjoyed this.  The recipe is for a traditional French quiche, no cheese just a rich custard.  I had to make it stretch to feed extras so I added diced shrimp and chopped broccoli.  The flavors were subtle but added a savory zing.  Thanks, Sal, I will make this again.

I'll make it for sure but possibly add cheese or something to flux the flavor.
