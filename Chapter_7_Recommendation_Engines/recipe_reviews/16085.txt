SUPER SALAD! I absolutely LOVED this salad! Added 1/2 cup red onion (chopped fine), 1/2 cup pecans (chopped fine), and 1/2 cup bacon bits.  Used sunflower seeds (about 2 oz) instead of pumpkin seeds. Served with Paul Newman's Balsamic Vinegarette (Light or Reg - both exceptional). What a nutritious and tasty salad! Simply fabulous! I tried some with spinach and some without and it's great both ways! Thanks for such a wonderful post!

When I first saw these ingredients, I thought this salad would be rather bland!  WRONG!!  It was delicious!  Went over well with the guests and it was extremely healthy.  Nice change from the lettuce and tomato salad.  Thanks for sharing this one.  I'll definitely be serving this one again!

This is really a colourful salad and quite delicious.  Very crunchy texture.  I added a red onion to mine.  I also made a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder and salt & pepper.

Simple, basic, but lovely and colorful fresh salad. I omitted the carrots (not a fan of them), using additional multi-colored bell peppers instead.  I added some thinly sliced red onion and chopped, toasted hazelnuts rather than the pumpkin seeds.  I used my own vinegar and olive oil dressing, ratio 3:1 of oil to vinegar.  A light, lemon vinaigrette would be delicious too.

Very colorful and healthy.  Used Paul Newman's light and marinated the pepper, cabbage and carrots in it before hand.  Also used sunflower seeds.
Next time I may consider shredded carrots instead, but there definitely is a next time. : )

Oh my.  This was a wonderful salad.  A very good change from the "same old same old salad".  I did not add the pumpkin seeds, but got some sunflower seeds instead.  I also added some romaine lettuce and crumbled feta cheese.  This is the first time I've ever eaten the balsamic salad dressing, but my hubby and I both went back for seconds!  We will have it again (soon!).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! Changes made--added chopped pecans thinly-sliced purple onion, and mandarin oranges...added sprinkle of Hormel bacon bits after tossing with dressing...lovely flavors and definitely colorful. Served with teriyaki pork loin and Thai noodles..yum!

I made this salad for 60 people at a Christian Seder meal. It was so enjoyed by all it was requested for future potluck suppers. Very easy to make.

This was a nice colorful & crunchy salad.  I bought a package of preshredded red cabbage which speeded up the prep time.  I also added grape tomatoes & substituted sunflower seeds for the pumpkin seeds.

This was good, pretty basic, I make a spinach salad often and vary the ingredients. I used a yellow bell pepper because the red ones aren't too great right now, i used both red and green cabbage because i had it on hand, and i added sliced red onions and chopped green onions for a little zip. i think it would be prettier with the red pepper instead of yellow, but it still tasted good. i used a balsamic vinagrette but let everyone put on whatever dressing they liked. i took it to my mom's easter dinner. it was a moderate success, those of us that like fresh greens gobbled it up.

Wonderful salad. I made it for a party and everyone loved it and wanted to know how to make it. I have told them how great this site is for getting the best of recipies.
I doubled the recipe, and put in torn red tipped lettuce, and I used Kraft's vinaigrette Balsamic Dressing.The little that was left, the hostess wanted to keep for her husband to have for breakfast! 10/5!

Delicious and beautiful.  At Easter, many people commented that they liked the salad.  People that normally don't like Balsamic Vinegarette dressing tried it on this salad and said it tasted great. The only change I made was sunflower seeds instead of pumpkin seeds.  I will be making this salad again.

I'm trying to incorporate more veggies in my diet so I made this salad thinking I would eat it for it's health benefits and not it's taste. I was pretty surprised when it turns out it tastes good too! I added a bit of green onions and it was fabulous. I didn't know how well it would keep in the fridge over a few days so prepared it minus the pumpkins seeds and the spinach and added those whenever I ate a bowl. It's very pretty as well!

Crunchy, delicious, and hearty -- a large serving easily makes a meal. I use Kraft's Light Done Right red wine vinaigrette or a homemade variation. I have made and served this many times since finding the recipe, and every guest finishes happy and wanting more!

Very good and colorful.  I think the cabbage is in too large of a quantity.  And the red pepper should be julienned, not chopped.  Also added feta and a little red onion.

really pretty salad.  I did not have pumpkin seeds, so I substituted sunflower seeds.  To make up for the missing color, I added chopped cauliflower.  Really, really good..............why didn't I think of this recipe?!  thanks!

I used sunflower seeds rather than pumpkin seeds to make it more summery. Delicious! The way I made it (see picture), there were too many carrots; they took over the flavor sometimes.

Oh the combination is so great! Just loved the salad........of whatever was left after my husband had several helpings. I had used chard instead of spinach and green cabbage and bell pepper instead of red as that's what I had. BUt this was still super. I used the "Fresh Fruit with Balsamic Vinaigrette" vinaigrette and it tasted much better than it did on fruits. Thanks a lot for a lovely recipe.

I made this salad to compliment our Easter meal.  It was a hit.  It was eaten right up.  Nothing left.

Very nice flavor combination, lovely colors, fresh and healthy. I added a yellow bell pepper also. My supermarket did not have hulled pumpkin seeds so I used sunflower seeds. Used the "Balsamic Vinaigrette" recipe here on AllRecipes.

Very fun and different spinach salad!  I made a giant bowl-ful for a church potluck and every bit disapppeared.  My only suggestion would be to buy/make a strong balsamic dressing, as the one I bought was light in flavor and somewhat overpowered by the strong produce elements.  Thanks!

Great salad. I've been making this for many years. Many are using sunflower seeds instead of pumpkin. Nice substitute, but try it with pumpkin seeds sometimes, too. This is the kind of salad that can be added to or taken from without a problem. Make to your taste and what you have on hand. The balsamic vinegar is always great on salads, although it will turn the ingredients a brown color, which some wjill find unappetizing.

Didn't like this at all.  I don't care for red cabbage though, but thought I would try it anyway.

Very nice change of pace for a lunch salad on a hot day.  Added some thin sliced sweet onion; the pumpkin seeds were a very nice addition.  I served the salad dressing on the side for individual tastes.  Thanks for posting, L.Stafford

Definitely add bacon, and lightly steam the carrots.

This was well-received at a family picnic. Great healthy salad that is beautiful as well, anything but run-of-the-mill. We're thinking of chopping/mixing the veggies to keep on hand for easy weeknight salads.

Loved this! I also added onions. I didn't have enough balsamic dressing so I substituted an organic Asian sesame dressing. It was to DIE for! This is now in the rotation.
