This was delicious! After reading the reviews I did make a few changes. I didn't really want two 8" cakes so baked the recipe in a Bundt pan, sprayed with Baking Spray. I used a yellow cake mix that had pudding in the mix. I increased the amount of chopped pecans to a heaping 3/4 cup. Because of the Bundt pan's narrow bottom (top of cake)the butter/brown sugar mixture was fairly deep. I added 2-oz. bourbon and 2 of the bananas (mashed) to the batter. I sliced the remaining 2 bananas and layered them on the pecan mixture--it was a tight fit but I squeezed them in and only had 3 or 4 banana slices that sat on top of other bananas. I baked it until tester came out clean (I didn't push tester down into bananas)--about 55 minutes.  I let the cake cool about 15 minutes then turned it out. Beautiful, aromatic, cake!  The thicker pecan-butter mixture carmalized perfectly and completely covered the bananas...couldn't see them at all and if they turned dark, there was no way to tell. Tasted great!! I took a photo of the cake and meant to take another THREE days later when there was only one remaining piece, to show how well it lasted, but it got eaten before I had the chance! I liked the texture of the cake...because of the mashed bananas, it was denser than a typical yellow cake. I'll never fret about the extra, too ripe for me to eat, bananas again...thanks, Dana!

Dana's "easy and yummy" description is right on the mark. I baked my cake in a 9x13" pan and it turned out great. My husband ate three pieces of this the night I served it to his parents. I took the leftovers to the office the next day and received many compliments and two recipe requests.

This cake was so moist and so easy! I did use walnuts instead of pecans but the flavor was very rich. This would fall under my catagory of comfort food. My family is not really into cakes but this one will be added to my file.

Had some bananas that I needed to do something with, saw this recipe and thought why not give it a try. After reading reviews this is what happened! I used a 13x9 glass baking dish. Sprayed dish with Crisco really good. Used 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar. One cup of pecans. Could not find Banana cake mix, used basic yellow. Followed instructions. Used baking sheet with wax paper, placed on top of cake and flipped, came out of baking dish perfect, no sticking at all. Cake looked and tasted great! Thanks for the recipe, reading reviews is definately a plus!

This is a super moist recipe that is sinful delicious and so easy.  It was wonderful and everyone at work thought so too. They are great sports at trying my new recipes.
I could not find a banana cake mix at my local grocer so I bought a white cake mix and added 2 tsp of banana extract. Yummy!

This recipe is awesome! My family rated it a 10 out of 5 stars, hehe. Quick to prepare, nice presentation, and a great alternative to those that find pineapple to be too caustic for their tastes. The only change I made was that I couldn't find banana cake mix, so I used a buttery yellow cake mix and added 1 tsp. of artificial banana flavoring. Next time I will increase the amount of brown sugar and nuts on the bottom, just because we really liked that part the best, but really this recipe is great as-is!

This was so so so good.  And I don't even like bananas! 

I used a skillet - be careful when flipping it! :)  I had to re-mold it, but you couldn't tell.  Also, I used Trader Joe's Vanilla cake mix - divine!

Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!

Simple to make and it tasted wonderful!!!.  We cut it right out of the over, it was still steaming.  We added vanilla ice cream or whip topping.  This will become a tradition in our house.

Ten stars !!!  I changed the recipe just a bit. Here is what I did: Yellow cake with pudding in the mix (it is all I had) 1 stick of butter/margarine; 3/4 cup brown sugar; no pecans. Melted the butter and mixed in the brown sugar. Used a bundt pan and poured the butter/brown sugar mixture in the bottom of the bundt pan after lightly greasing. Sliced four bananas and placed them on top of the butter/brown sugar mixture.  Mixed the cake mix according to package directions and poured over bananas.  It took 40 minutes at 350 for mine to be done.  Let it cool for about 15 minutes in the pan and then inverted onto a cake plate.  Very pretty and looks scrumptious.

This is a very good recipe and very versatile.  I have made it twice.  First time, I made it as written and it was very tasty, but not nearly enough topping.  The second time I made it, I used Yellow cake mix and a box of Banana pudding mix, I doubled the topping, but I used Macadamia Nuts instead of Pecans and I added Coconut.  I also added mini chocolate chips to the batter and added 1/4 cup of Amarula Cream Liquer.  It was FANTASTIC!!

Banana is my favourite cake and this was fantastic!  We like a little denser banana cake so next time I will use a Banana Muffin Mix instead of the regular banana cake mix.  Oh, so delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was such a yummy cake!!! Was pretty easy to make, too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the syrup made half of the bananas stick to the pan, so it wasn't pretty. That didn't stop up from digging in though - and it was sooo yummy!!! Oh man...the smell while it was cooking - I couldn't WAIT to be done with dinner so I could move on to dessert!

Very moist and yummy.  I didn't have banana cake mix so I used yellow cake and it was just as good, I'm sure.  Also added cinnamon to the cake mix. Cooked about 30 min. in one 9x13 pan.

This is deeelicious!  I couldn't find banana cake mix so I used a yellow mix and added a mashed banana to it.  I love butter/sugar/pecan topping so I decided to double it, but it made it a little too sweet, so next time I'll only do 1 1/2 x's the butter/sugar but double the nuts.  Lastly, I wanted one big cake so I just used a 9x13 pan and baked it for 40 minutes.  Turned out onto a platter as soon as it came out and there was no sticking and it looked very pretty.  I ate a piece warm and the bananas just melt in your mouth.  So good!

Very good cake.  I used very ripe bananas and I used a butter pecan cake mix since I could not find a banana cake mix here.  I also added a banana to the cake mixture.  I went ahead and stake the cakes instead of having two seperate cakes.

I don't think many stores will carry banana cake mix, but I used one package of the Jell-O instant banana pudding mix (0.9oz pk).  I just added to the cake mix and I followed the box directions which showed to only bake for 27-32 minutes using 9" pans and that was enough time.  I used 6 tbls butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/14 chopped pecans because that's the best part.  I rated this recipe a 4 because it was delicious when it first left the oven, but it doesn't last.  I put it in the fridge (covered) for the next day since I baked at night, and by the morning the taste was not as good.  The bananas don't hold up well, so I recommend to bake right before serving and try to finish it since the taste is not as good the next day.  I like banana bread much better than this cake.  I sprinkle the top of the banana bread with chopped pecans, buter and brown sugar before baking and it tastes so delicious....and it will last for days!

Is very tasty!!!  I subbed French vanilla cake mix, added a box of banana cream pudding, used 4 eggs, milk, oil.  It's a killer cake but the pecan/brown sugar mixture does seem to leave alot in the pan behind.  I really coated the pan too.  My bananas were sliced like medallions and couldn't seem them under all the pecan/sugar mixture, but I did notice they had a green tint to them.  Next time may decrease the brown sugar slightly and maybe a little more butter.  I'll also make sure the brown sugar is slightly cooked to help dissolve the granules so will soak in a little more.

Ate a piece fresh from the oven.

Thanks for sharing and this is a keeper.

This was fantastic!  Used canola oil instead of butter in my yellow cake mix, and added a tsp of coconut extract and a cup of shredded coconut to the batter.  Also sprinkled coconut in the pan before putting the banana slices in.  This was soooo moist and delicious!

Yum! Best Dessert Ever! 

We also used a yellow cake mix with 2-1/2 mashed bananas and then made as directed but put it all in a 9x13 cake pan. We're thinking about making it as a layered cake next time in a bundt pan!

This was fantastic!!!  I didn't have banana cake mix, so I used moist yellow cake mix instead.  I mashed a banana with spiced rum and added it to the mix.  I also doubled the topping mix and divided it all into cupcake pans.  Absolutely amazing!!!!

Very delicious and not overly sweet; has a very good balance. I also could not find banana cake mix, so I sprinkled banana creme instant gelatin on top of the bananas and used yellow cake mix.  Worked very well.

Pretty good...I added a little more butter than it called for, and it came out great!  The only thing is, it didn't keep well for leftovers, but that's ok - next time I'll make it for a potluck...I'm sure there will be no leftovers! (And my bananas DID NOT turn green!lol)

This cake was OK, but not nearly as good as pineapple upside down cake. My large family thought it was just OK, and it wasn't really a hit in our home. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't super delicious either.

I will be making this at my next potluck. I did find banana cake mix. A couple changes I did as recommended by others were as follows: I added a third of the sliced banana to the cake mix, and put the rest as directed. I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Gave some cake to two neighbors and my hubby and they thought it was exceptional.

We LOVED this.  I found a banana cake mix and so it was very banana-y but very delicious.  Everyone that tried it said it reminded them of caramel rolls.  We served it warm with ice cream on the side one time but it's good on it's own too!

I just made this cake in two spring form pans that I lined with foil and sprayed with pam. I used apple bananas,(I live on Kauai and love this type), if you can find them use them, they tend to be more tart than the "big Yellow" ones.  The topping came out perfect, right off of the foil.
Mahalo for a great recipe!

I served this to my family and some of our friends, including a total of 8 kids.  Every piece was gone!  It was easy and very tasty.  My bananas did turn greenish but they didn't stop anybody from eating the cake.  I would make 3 round cakes instead of 2 next time because they ran over the top of the pans while baking but even the run over parts were delicious.

Oh so good! Only made one change because it was what I had-used a yellow cake mix & added a ripe mashed banana to the batter.  Next time I will make as muffins because the crust/edge of the cake is so good.  With muffins there will be even more crispy edges-yummy!

This was delicious....what a great way to use up bananas.  I used slivered almonds instead of pecans and used a pecan and praline cake mix.  It was a big hit with the adults and the kids!

This recipe is out of this world!! I did make a few changes. I didn't have banana cake mix so I used yellow cake mix and mashed the bananas into the mix. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. Then I added a splash of Jack Daniel's. I increased the pecans, brown sugar and butter, and omitted the bananas in the topping. It was the best cake we have ever had and I know it is the best I've ever made! Thanks!!

This stuff is amazing!!  The smell was wonderful while it was in the oven.  I did however bake it in 10in. cast iron skillet(just like I would have made a pineapple upside down cake).  Added about a tablespoon more butter than what is suggested to the brown sugar.  And I could not find a banana cake mix, so I used golden vanilla cake mix with 2/3tsp. of banana flavoring.  It was wonderful and I will be making it again this weekend for a sunday school lunch.  Awesome!!

Just made this to serve as a dessert for my dinner party.  Wow!!  It was wonderful!  Made it exactly as the recipe called for and used a 13 X 9 pan.  Inverted it as soon as it came out of oven and nothing stuck.  The cake and the presentation was 5 stars.

The presentation of this cake is great.  I give it a five because of the couple modifications that I made - I used yellow cake mix mixed with a packet of instant vanilla pudding - and I added some chocolate chips - the cake turned out FANTASTIC:)

I love this recipe.  It is great to throw in the oven when you find out you have company coming.  It is not overly sweet since there is no "icing" on it.  The bananas and the nuts are enough.  A great simple desert.

EASY!! I used a butter-flavored cake for the cake part and threw in a little flaked coconut over the nuts before the cake. I baked them in two 9in. pans and stacked them straight from the pan. What a great dessert... moist, tasty!

This is a great, easy recipe. I changed it by adding spraying a cast iron skillet with Pam spray and using the entire recipe in one skillet. ( like the old fashioned pineapple upside down cake ) It worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing this.

It was ok if I picked the bananas off.  Did anyone else have the bananas take on a very strange almost rubbery texture?  
Probably won't try it again.  Had high hopes after all the reviews.

I'm an average baker and was originally scared off by the idea of everything sticking to the pan.  I decided to try a spring form pan and it turned out great.  I used baking spray on bottom and sides, baked it for 55 minutes , let it partially cool, then flipped it over with almost nothing sticking.  I failed to realize that stuff was going to seep out of the bottom of the spring form pan bottom, so be sure to put it on a cookie sheet covered with foil.  Also, I had to put foil around the edges about 20 minutes into baking t o keep the edges from overbrowning.  

I followed the other reviewers' tips and added a mashed up, ripe banana and half of a small box of instant banana pudding mix.  I also added coconut on top of the pecans before adding the cake mixture.  I used yellow cake since I couldn't find banana.  After it was cool, I did a chocolate drizzle just to make it look good and add a touch of chocolate.  

It tasted great and the only change I might make is to double up on the bananas.  I would've liked a more pronounced banana taste.  Definitely making this again because it was easy, impressive to look at, tasted great and made folks actually think I can bake.

I love this website! Reading the reviews has almost always given me amazing results for any of the recipes I've made over these many years. This one is no exception. I took a picture of it because it looks so wonderful! I used a yellow (pudding) cake mix. added 1/2 tsp of baking soda and put 3 mashed and very ripe bananas into the batter. I did increase the butter, sugar and nuts for the topping, as suggested. SOOOO good!

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious. I did use 1/2 c butter and 3/4 c Brown sugar for the bottom and cooked it in a 9×13 pan without dividing the cake mixture. It took about 35 minutes to bake. We served it with vanilla ice cream. All 5 of my kids LOVED it. Will be making this again!

I loved this cake. It was moist and the flavors all really came together. I did use a yellow cake mix just because I couldn't find a banana cake mix. I made it in a 9' x 13' pan as well as I don't have 8 inch round pans. Due to the difference in pan size I only had to bake it like 30 minutes. My advice when it smells done it probably is done.

The bananas the next day were just soggy. I thought it would have been a much better cake without the sliced bananas on top.

This recipe is amazing. I used the Wilton Banana Cake recipe and substituted walnuts for the pecans. Everyone loved it.

So good!  I had to add the banana extract to a yellow cake mix as recommended prior, and last night I had a warm piece with ice cream (also recommended before).  It's sinful!
