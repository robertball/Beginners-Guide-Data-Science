I don't know about this one folks.  I tried as is (without the suggested breakfast sausage) and did not like.  The tortillas got soggy and although it smelled good, it tasted so mushy that it was hard to enjoy (and I baked it for 65 minutes).  I would highly recommend to those who try this to please add the crumbled sausage.  As for me, I MIGHT try this again WITH the meat and try it with flour tortillas. Otherwise, would not recommend.

This was a great recipe. Made it for a brunch at my house with my girlfriends and they loved it.  I added 1/2 lb. of sausage - could have added more. When I was done browning I added a packet of taco seasoning and it brought the recipe together. I also added jalpeno's as well. Made fresh guac. and sour cream and salsa afterwards. Super easy to make and virtually impossible to mess up. Next time I'll add more ingredients.  This is a great starter recipe to build upon.

Very, very good...my husband said it was the best breakfast ever.  I added crembled breakfast sausage that I think was a great addition.

Don't listen to some of these negative remarks.  I have been making this casserole 10 years at my annual Christmas Brunch.  We have between 40-50 people every year and they always ask, "Did you make the mexican one?"- as they call it.  I have developed only 4 staple casseroles worthy of a Christmas brunch, while trying about 3 new ones a year.(That's about 30 casseroles that didn't make the cut).  This is definately one that will never leave my menu. My husband gets mad if there are no leftovers, so this year I may even double it!  Thanks Raquel!

Yum - I really liked this one. I think the flavor of corn tortillas and eggs just really appeals to me. I changed this up according to what I had on hand - used 14 tortillas instead of 12, used regular onions chopped fine, and didn't include the chilies or pimentos because I used a can of Mexican tomatoes. Will be making again - thanks!

I wanted to add some volume and kick it up a notch in spice, so I browned three chorizo links with 1/2 chopped onion and added that into the layers, plus a can of niblets corn.  I used reduced fat Mexican blend cheese and fat free milk, and it was delicious.  Everyone at work loved it.

Before adding the the corn tortillas, stack them, then cut into 6 wedges.  This makes them much more manageable in the casserole.  Reserve some of the shredded cheese.  Cook the casserole covered in foil for the first 50 minutes, then uncover and sprinkle with the reserved cheese.  Cook the remaining 10 minutes, then let set for about 10 minutes before serving.

Loved this! Easy to prepare and with great flavor even using medium-hot salsa. I found organic, almost home-made corn tortillas that added a lot of yummy texture.

Tasty and attractive!  I added browned breakfast sausage, used 6 eggs and cut back the milk to one cup because my salsa was pretty juicy.  It was delicious and the texture was perfect!

I made this for an Easter potluck for church and I haven't stopped getting requests for it to be made again. I didn't use the breack fast sauages and even several of of my gluten allergic friends have asked for the recipes since it has no gluten in it and most egg casseroles have bread in them.

I made this with flour tortillas, and the consistency was almost perfect. I froze my leftovers (it was just me eating it, otherwise there wouldn't have been any leftovers), and found out the after being re-heated, they turned out pretty dry, so I'd suggest eating the leftovers (if you have any) pretty quickly, just refrigerating, not freezing, them. This is definitely a great all-around recipe, and open to adding almost anything you want (I'm a vegetarian, so I won't be trying the sausage as an add-in).

Great recipe.  I used reg flour shells, green chilles, cheddar cheese, green onion, *tater-tot flat rounds, & chopped precooked bacon.  Turned out delicious.  Made for myself and 2 families this week.
did not refrigerate overnight, let sit for 3-4 hours left covered (spray tinfoil)to bake for 60-65 mins.  Baked up nicely.  Thank you!

This was a BIG hit at my work.  I doubled the recipe and used my favorite salsa.  It's not a heavy b-fast and tastes really fresh!  Next time I make it I'll post a picture.  Thanks for the recipe - YUM.

This recipe was OK but nothing really special.  I made it for my daughter's Hawaiian-themed birthday party.  People ate it but no one took seconds.

The best way to describe this is a breakfast enchilada casserole. If you are looking for an egg casserole this is not it. It was good, but not extraordinary.

This was so yummy! I brought it to MOPS this morning and got a few compliments. I used red onion instead of green onion and I added Jimmy Dean reduced fat cheese.  It's hearty enough to serve for dinner too.

Thank you for an excellent, easy recipe!  Every once in a while, I bring this for my running group's post-run breakfast.  This is always the first dish that disappears, no matter how much food we have.  Sometimes I add some browned chorizo for an extra kick.

Great recipe Raquel. good flavor. easy to make. I even had to leave out the onions & peppers since I didn't have any. Next time I won't skimp on the tortilla shells, it turned out to soggy.

Great recipe. Comes out light and fluffy -- sort of like a layered souffle. I add a dash or two of cumin and a pinch of cayenne to the egg/milk mix just to enhance the Mexican flavor and spice it up a bit. Delish. Make it all the time for gatherings and it never fails to disappear -- everyone loves it. Don't understand the "mushy" comment. Maybe the reviewer isn't familiar with egg casseroles? If you live at a high altitude you may have to cook it longer..I just cook it until it's fluffy inside and not too jiggly. Also sometimes leave out the salsa and serve it on the side. Huge hit.

Very tasty!  Made this past weekend for family brunch and we all enjoyed it.  I served sour cream and extra salsa on the side, which made nice complements.  A very easy and delicious recipe - I wouldn't change a thing.  Makes a good vegetarian dish (although adding sausage as the other reviewers' did sounds quite good as well).  I'll make it again.

I added sausage to the recipe and it was great!  Sewrve it with sour cream, salsa and chopped cilantro and you have a great make-ahead breakfast.

It's a decent basic recipe. I added 1/3lb sausage, 1/3lb bacon, black beans, chopped onion, garlic and more tortillas. Also less milk and an extra egg. After 45min a topped w more cheese and let it cook uncovered 15-20 more min. With all the additions, changes and whatnot, it's essentially a dif recipe.

I started by making my own corn tortillas, and left out the pimentos. I made it as a dinner casserole with almost a whole, simmered chicken cut up in small pieces and added in the three layers. I expected a more quiche texture with the eggs and milk, but you wouldn't even know it was there. Just a nice layered casserole.

I love this recipe! It is my go-to for when we have food day at work or houseguests. I make it as is, but instead of adding sausage, I throw in chorizo instead and that really gives it the Mexican flare.  I also love how this it Gluten Free since I have a few friends and a brother-in-law who are celiac.

I did not care for this recipe. My casserole was runny, with soggy corn tortillas.

I loved this recipe!  Very tasty.  Smells delicious when baking!  I used 6 eggs and 6 egg whites.  I also added a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper!

Good basic recipe I can see additions to make different casseroles. This was the fiorst timed I tyried this recipe. I made a few changes, I did not have any pimentos so of course they were left out. After reading some of the other reviews I increased the eggs to 8 and cut back to 1 cup of milk. I added 1 1/2 cups of diced ham.
I served it to a group of VBS teachers and they raved about it. Some came back for seconds, but there wasn't any.

This recipe is so-o-o good!  I made it exactly using corn tortillas and have made this every week- it tastes even better the 2nd day so I take to work for breakfast or lunch.  My grandaughter even had 3 helpings!  Great recipe!!

I added some cooked crumbled sausage and it was fantastic.  Otherwise don't change a thing.  Delicious!

Very good recipe. Added sausage as suggested. Had to cook an extra 30 minutes as it was very watery at 60 minutes. Will make again.

Love this recipe. I also add cooked breakfast sausage, only add the diced green chiles instead of both kinds and omit the olives.  We have made this numerous times and it turns out great every time.  Sometimes we throw a little sour cream and hot sauce on top.

Delicious!  Made this for a Fathers Day breakfast.  I threw in a jar of Trader Joes Cowboy Caviar (13 oz) as I wasn't interested in the black olives and didn't have the chilis or pimentos. I used fresh pico de gallo instead of jar salsa. It was spicy and delicious!

This was OK but nothing particularly exciting about it.  Easy.
