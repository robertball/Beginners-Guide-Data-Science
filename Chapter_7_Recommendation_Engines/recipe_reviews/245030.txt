I scaled this down to 1 serving for my breakfast today, and it was good! I made my own sunflower seed butter by placing a heaping tablespoon of roasted sunflower seeds in my food processor and grinding them fine before adding a light drizzle of light olive oil. This worked great! I added the banana to the processor and gave it a few pulses to blend everything together, including the agave nectar. My only criticism is that there was too much banana mixture to oatmeal. Next time I think half the amount of banana would work just fine.

I was initially sceptic about trying this recipe for my daughter Annie, but in the end it turned out she really loved it and even her friends who came visiting had a taste and had nothing but yummy praises to my skilled cuisine :). Although the Banana has potassium and Fibre, which is super good for the growth, development and overall health of my kid, the oatmeal is a helpful remedy for my sugar level control. Overall ratings for this recipe and to top it all, it's very easy for a dad like me to prepare and fast also.

I had a bunch of ripe bananas at home that no one wanted to eat, but I am very much against throwing away food. So I found this recipe that uses ripe bananas and tried it. I had all the necessary ingredients at hand, which is a big plus point, of course. I used a little less nectar, actually, because I can't much sweet at breakfast. But I loved it, as did my husband. Will definitely try this again the next time I end up with ripe bananas again.

Such a great breakfast! The bananas gave me enough energy to last the morning during an early shift at work, and the pink salt made for a great added taste boost! Really love how it's how smooth and there's a gentle bite due to the oatmeal.
