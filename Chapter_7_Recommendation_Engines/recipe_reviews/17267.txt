This was the best cornbread ever.  I replaced the sugar with a 1/2 cup honey and cooked in a 9" greased and floured cake pan until a toothpick came out clean.  Really, this was very good!

This is one of the best corn muffin recipes that I have tried.  It is not dry and both my daughter and son-in-law really enjoyed these corn muffins.

I have never had my cornbread come out so well.  My husband and kids just loved them.  In fact my kids just ate the cornbread for supper -- now that is some good cornbread.  I will never make it a different way again.  This recipe is so easy that your children 3 & up can help put it together. ---  Crystal

I needed at least 40 cornbread muffins for my daughter's classroom Thanksgiving feast. I doubled this recipe and got 41 muffins. I actually made it twice because the dog got to my first batch...she loved them. So did the kids in my daughter's class.

Best corbread muffins I have ever made (or had!)  I have tried many recipes (especially with my mom being from the South), and have had a hard time finding a keeper.  I added a little cheese, and they were very good ... but still would have been good without the cheese.

Fantastic recipe.  I scaled the recipe amount to half, used an iron mold pan to make eight sticks, and it was PERFECT with vegetable soup.  (One tip: If you use a heavy iron pan like I did, let them cool a couple of minutes before loosening with a butter knife.)  Great taste, texture, and consistency.  This one is definitely going in my notebook.

I made this recipe with melted butter instead of vegetable oil and instead of making muffins out of it, I cooked it in my cast iron skillet. I melted a couple pats of butter in the skillet (while the oven preheated) before pouring the cornbread batter into the skillet. 350 for just about 40 minutes. This cornbread looked beautiful and just AWESOME in the pan but it was a little dry. Not by much, it might be that I over baked it slightly or the cornmeal needs to be cut back just a touch. I don't get how others had issues with this recipe not rising or coming out tough other than those reviewers overmixed their batter. Overmixing cornbread batter is a huge no-no--you want to wisk all your wet ingredients together and your dry ingredients together in seperate bowls, then fold the dry into the wet until just moistened. The batter will be a little lumpy, but it all comes out in the wash. I also noticed that my batter was quite wet right after I folded my dry ingredients into the wet ingredients but after letting it sit for a couple minutes, it was the right consistancy. No complaints here. I really do think that using vegetable oil instead of butter and it would not have been as good--but I'm a butter lover.

I thought these were really good muffins. After reading prior reviews I too thought 450 was too high so I baked them at 425. Seemed perfect and muffins rose nicely and were cooked inside at the same time as outside. I filled the muffin cups about 3/4 full and it made exactly the right amount of muffins as stated.

At first I was a little surprised by the consistency of the batter.  I thought I had made some horrible error, but decided to go ahead and bake them to see what would happen.  The BEST cornbread muffins is what happened!  These are EXACTLY what I want in cornbread.  The right hint of sweet with a little tang of buttermilk and tender moist insides.  I did change one thing, and that was that I pre-heated my muffin tins before filling them.  This is what my grandmother always did.  She claimed that was what made hers turn out properly, so I've always done it that way as well.

I doubled the recipe and it made 24 muffins & an 8x8 pan. 400 degrees for 15 minutes and the muffins were done - maybe 5 minutes longer for the pan.  It could be jazzed up a bit more or serve with spicy chili.  Split and topped with honey would also be good.  I decorated the tops with a flower design made from shelled pumpkin seeds - that dressed them up a bit.  The recipe adjustments I made were to replace half the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, the vegetable oil was substituted with Smart Balance Omega (a blend of canola and olive oil for a healthier fat).  Didn't quite have enough buttermilk so I rinsed out the buttermilk carton with nonfat milk.  Spraying pans with Pam had them slipping right out - I think that was a better choice than using paperliners that other reviewers said stick too much to the final product.

These muffins barely rose AT ALL. They weren't overly dense, which was a bonus, but they were fairly bland. I was really looking for that nice crispy cornbread muffin top, but got a sad little round puck.

I don't like sweeter cornbreads, so the flavor did not put me off, but this is just something to take into account when making this recipe. Either way, I expected something MUCH better for how highly rated this recipe was.

I had high hopes for this! I love good restaurant cornbread and the kind with creamed corn, and I think Jiffy is dreadful stuff. I made a batch last night for preschool today and found it fairly bitter in the back of the mouth. The kids won't care, but I would not make this again. The other recipe I was considering, Sweet Corn Muffins, had more flour to less cornmeal, and maybe I'll try that next time. Also, this batter was almost as thin as pancake batter, which alarmed me! Although it did rise and brown nicely.

Okay, but bland.  Maybe if you added some fruit to the batter, but it is a very runny batter and the fruit might not mix in evenly.  Mine didn't rise very much and I would say the cups could have been filled fuller to look more like the ones in the picture.  If you are eating these with a gravy or something to dip them, they are probably just right for that. I followed the recipe as is, no changes.

Wonderful recipe!  Perfect consistency, moist, and full of flavor.  I made no changes which is unusual for me!  However, instead of muffins, I made muffin tops.  Got 16 large (3.5") muffin tops and baked them for 10 mins. at 375.  My husband and I both loved them.  This recipe will take the place of my regular cornbread recipe (been making it for almost 49 years).  Thanks for this delicious recipe!

If you like a less sweet corn muffin, this is the one!  I've tried many recipes and they all seemed to be too crumbly but this one is perfect.  Great!

This was the best cornbread recipe I've ever had, and so easy too!  The batter seemed thin at first, but cooked up to make wonderful, moist muffins with crisp tops.  They were delicious!  The recipe does make 24, rather than just 12.

I followed this recipe exactly. My cornbread muffins did not rise, they were rubbery and stuck like mad to the muffin paper. Thank god I didnt put them right in the muffin tin or I would still be scraping them out. I found the flavour to be bland and not sweet enough.

When I read that the oven temp was 450 I was skeptical but went ahead with it anyway. of course the muffins came out a little burned.  Next time I would cook at a lower temp for longer. Could use more sweetness.  Used rice milk instead of buttermilk due to allergy. Taste was pretty good.

These were really good! Very easy and quick, and super tasty with a bit of butter and honey.  I only had one cup of buttermilk so I used normal milk for the other half and they were still fine. Also, I can't find cornmeal here in Australia so I used polenta.  Still delicious! Thanks!

These turned out very good, not too sweet and nice and soft. The batter worried me a little as it was very loose and Im used to a more firm cornbread batter from a mix so don't let this scare you, they turn out fine.

I was a little leary to bake at 450 degrees, that seemed too hot...but these baked up tall, moist and perfect, at 14 minutes. I don't know why some reviewers, had a problem? Maybe they were looking for a more sweet cake-like cornbread... ? This is not a very sweet one, which was exactly what I wanted, to go with some spicy chili. Thank you, ChrisW, for sharing a terrific recipe!

I think this is a good recipe. Cornbread is very subjective, so it's hard for me to give a rating. If you like a sweeter cornbread, this base recipe is maybe not for you. It is dense and mealy, not cakey at all. I think a warm and buttered muffin is great, and this recipe will give you that.

I just baked 3 different corn muffin recipes from this website, and compared to the other 2 recipes and compared to my normal recipe, this recipe is a disappointment. These muffins simply lack flavor. And they don't rise very high, even though they do have a pretty good texture inside. These corn muffins are not sweet at all (and neither are my normal corn muffins), but unless you're eating them with something very flavorful, they are pretty bland. When they are first mixed, the batter is pretty runny, but thickens up in a minute or two (so don't worry). I'm going to have to keep looking for the ultimate recipe.

I thought these were very tasty. I was a little concerned about the amount of oil, but they turned out very moist and flavorful. My 8yo really liked them. I usually stick to the traditional cornbread in the cast iron pan, but I actually lined a muffin tin with paper liners to make these. I also halved the recipe just to try it, and even though I halved it and fill the muffin liners really full, I had alot of batter left over. So this makes alot.

Wow this is probably the best success I have had making a good cornbread in years!!!  The only thing I did different is I baked it whole in a cast iron skillet.  I find it important to to prepare the skillet with vegetable spray then coat with corn meal.  After preparing skillet, place in the preheated oven at 450 for about 10-15 minutes.  Then pour batter in hot skillet.  I also used the veg spray about half way through to coat  the cornbread, and that added to the nice browning effect!   All in all, this one is a keeper!!!!!! :)

No flavor - dense, didn't rise much at all.  Regular recipe from cornmeal package is much better.

4.5 stars! Was a tad bit sweeter than I prefer, but that'll be an easy fix.  It's a very simple recipe that's worth keeping.  Also, don't be tempted to stretch the batter beyond a 12-piece muffin pan; otherwise the muffins probably won't rise well (or look pretty!).  Sidenote: your cups will definitely be more than 2/3 full.

AT first I was uncertain about the consistency of the finished(batter) product..and ( I do Agree with a prior review that this recipe can be more than a dozen...  I myself had yielded 18)  i poured the somewhat thin batter into my buttered muffin cups( no paper cups) and "voila....beautiful..golden..  buttery crispy bottomed ..soft tender ..flavorful...I was Impressed...I had made a large pot of my homemade Chili..what a delightful accompaniment....very balanced flavor without too much sweet and great texture...(those who say it is is dry are way off....the texture is just right for a cornmeal treat)   well done..

My husband is wheat and egg intolerant so I modified the recipe. Instead of 3/4 cup flour I used 3/4 cup brown rice flour and to replace the 2 eggs I used 1 over ripe banana and 1/4 c. applesauce. The muffins rose beautifully and he rated them 12 out of 10!!!! He doesn't want me to change the recipe however I may replace the vegetable oil with applesauce next time around to make the muffins lower in fat. We both loved the muffins and the 15 I made were gone by the end of the night!!

I started making this recipe and realized I did not have enough cornmeal. I was pressed for time and used what I had...believe it or not...instant grits. I used 1/2 cup sugar because my guys like a sweeter muffin. I also used regular milk soured with a bit of vinegar. Not sure they resembled the original recipe at all, but they were really gooD!

This recipe was pretty good. We like a sweet cornbread, and after reading the other reviews, I did some tweaking. I used 1/2 cup sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, and put a pinch of shredded cheddar cheese on top of each muffin before baking. They came out very nicely, and went well with the chili I made to accompany.

Very, very easy.  I added 1 cup grated parmesan cheese and 1 cup frozen corn kernals to batter.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used the buttermilk substitution from this site (1 cup milk, minus 1 tablespoon, plus 1 tablespoon of lemon juice).  I got 12 large muffins (muffin cups were filled to the brim!)

Also, I forgot to add the oil to the recipe and they came out fine and rose up nicely.
That was the good, here is the bad..
very, very bland--needs a kick of flavor, maybe garlic powder or cajun seasoning would kick it up a bit. Also, do not fill the cups full like I did, it was very hard to remove from the tins.  Not terrible, but not so good either.

Being a southern girl, I'm always on the lookout for good cornbread.  This one was Very good.  I was worried that it was going to be sweet, but it wasn't.  I can't stand sweet cornbread.  I added a handful of green onions and a handful of cheese.  It was wonderful.  Crispy on the outside and moist inside.  My husband even commented that he thought it was one of the best cornbreads that he can remember.  And that is saying something!!

These were very good - I used them to make the Corn Dog Muffins on this site and added 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar to the batter.  I baked them at 425 (because my pans are dark) for only 12 minutes or so.  Nice and moist.

This recipe was okay, but it didn't have a lot of flavor.  I will definitely substitute honey for the sugar next time.  Also, because of the "wet" nature of the batter, make sure you don't pour the batter into the muffin cup liners too early... the muffins won't come out!  :o)  I will try this recipe again!

These were really really good. I did not have any buttermilk so I used 1 c. heavy cream and 1 c. water. They turned out so moist and delicious. They were just sweet enough and were exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again!

Great recipe! Came out perfect the first time :D   It's a warm summer so I only needed to bake them for 13 minutes. Yum.    As for the reviewer who found it dry: perhaps the batter was over-stirred? Or the humidity/temperature in your area is different so you need to adjust baking time?

I read all the other reviews and then took some advice from several and added a bit more sugar and 1 tsp of chili powder. These muffins are excellent and were a real hit at our house. And what is more...they are lovely and moist the next day. I'll certainly be making them again.

This was the first time I have ever made cornbread of any kind.  They turned out really well, but weren't quite what I was expecting.  I was thinking of something a little more textured I guess - similar to cornbread muffins I'd had during university.  Anyway, these are good and moist and a beautiful colour.  They are maybe a tad bland - I might try honey next time instead of sugar to see if that changes the flavour and how.  I greased the pan with lard and they popped out of the muffin tin really well.  Also I had no buttermilk on hand so I made my own - 2 cups milk + 2 tbsp white vinegar, a bit of salt and pepper - mix and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.    All in all, a good recipe!  I will try some others to find something with a different, less "fine" texture - but I will keep this too.  It can't hurt to have multiple varieties of cornbread, can it?

These tasted just okay.  The batter is so liquidy and they didn't rise well...and the final texture was not really like any cornbread I've ever had.  More spongy, kind of weird.  That being said, my kids loved them and they went well with my beans and ham, but I'll be trying other cornbread recipes.

Yum! Yum! This cornbread recipe was great with the slow cooker beans and pork! The buttermilk makes them so moist you don’t need butter... I have tried variations of cornbread recipes, but this one tops them all!  I used a 13 x 9 and came out with close to 18 squares.   Also is great with jam as a desert! Great job!

I was not very impressed.  It makes way more than 12 muffins and they did not rise very well.  They were dense and kind of chewy instead of light or crumbly like traditional corn bread muffins.  Jiffy is much easier and has a superior taste and texture.

Nice moist muffin.  The oven temp of 450 seemed way to hot.  Pulled them out in 12 minutes and they were a bit over brown already.

This was a really good, easy recipe. I made a half recipe, making 12 muffins. I didn't have buttermilk, so I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to a cup of milk, and that worked just fine. I also added some frozen corn (maybe 3/4 cup), and that was a good addition. Mine were done after about 13 minutes, so be sure to keep an eye on them. I'm sure I'll use this recipe again!

This recipe was perfect just as it is.  It filled 12 large muffin cups to the top and they came out cone shaped perfect and best of all tasted great.  This is to become my standard corn muffin recipe. Thank You!!!!

I really like this recipie!  I am not able to digest milk well, but digest yogurt great, so I always substitue and this recipie ended up with a perfect blend of tangy and sweet.  I made a half batch and baked it in a cast iron pan.  It was a perfect muffin consistancy - springing up fluffy at a press on its top.  Yippee!

I thought these were great. Half of a recipe makes 12 muffins. I did not use liners and just greased each muffin cup with butter to get the crunchy outside. 

I decreased the sugar to about 2 tablespoons for half a recipe. I also only used whole milk. 

Be very careful and do not over mix. I found a few lumps are ok.

Maybe its a southern thing but we didn't care for this recipe that much. It was on the heavy side and just not a good cornbread flavor to us and we love cornbread.

Very good muffin. I took the suggestion of adding some cheddar cheese to the mix. Went well with a pot of chili.

I added frozen corn and dried cranberries to this recipe for added sweetness, texture, and flavor.  I also omitted the oil to make them healthier, and next time will use less sugar, as the berries and corn add sweetness to the muffins too.  Very good, easy to make, and healthy!  So as a college student, pretty much ideal!

I made these for my grandparents for Christmas last year and "taste tested" one myself to make sure they were edible. Boy were they! Very moist, slightly tangy from the buttermilk, very hearty and flavorful. I'm giving a batch to them again this year!

I made these as directed except I had to substitute milk and vinegar for the buttermilk. I took them to a bbq where we had ribs, coleslaw, corn on the cob, and macaroni and cheese. They were a big hit with the kids and adults. They were the only thing that wasn't leftover!

Good recipe.  I would fill cups 3/4 full as some were too small.  When I saw amount of batter left would not make 24, I filled cups a bit more and this second group was much better.

This is the 1st time I made cornbread muffins out of scratch. I substituted with sugar free almond milk, increased sugar to 1/2cup(family wants it sweet), & baked 12 muffins in 400F for 15 minutes. It turned out great!!! I will certainly make this again.

Great recipe and easy too. I added 2/3 cup of shredded cheddar and 2/3 cup cubed ham and decreased the sugar by half for a more savory muffin. We took them camping and they were a huge hit!

Left out the sugar and used almond milk in place of buttermilk. Did it for a diet/cleanse I'm on, but results were delicious and healthy! Used a double-size muffin tin and dropped a hard-boiled egg with a bit of paprika in one for fun. Had to bake a little longer on account of muffin size.

This recipe was quite good! I didn't have buttermilk so I added vinegar to milk, I cut the recipe in half and got 8 large muffins. The consistency was wonderful, moist, not at all dense. I was very careful not to over mix the batter. They were not quite as sweet as I like, but that was easily remedied by serving with honey butter. I baked them at 425 as 450 seemed too high, they were perfectly done at 15 minutes.

I went through 3 different recipes to find the perfect corn muffin to serve my bridge group.  This recipe won hands down.  I used mini muffin tins sprayed with Pam.  They were moist with the right amount of sweetness.  Recipe made 24 with enough left for 4 regular sized muffins.

These were good with the 1-2-3 Vegetable Chili I had for dinner. But by themselves they're a little bland. I liked the texture though. It made 16 muffins and 2 small pans of miniature muffins.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I have to say I loved them. I made a batch of muffins, and then I also used the recipe to make a loaf of cornbread as well. The muffins I had to take out after 10 minutes, as they were starting to burn, and the loaf took about 20 minutes. Between myself, my 2 year old, and her father, both were gone in less than 24 hours.

This was the best cornbread muffin recipe that I have ever made or had!  I was just so surprised because the batter was very, very liquid and I had no idea how it would turn out.  I made them with my toddler in mind and he LOVED them!  I made them in a mini muffin tray, cooked them the 14 minutes and they turned out perfect!  So did the larger muffins that I made with the rest of the batter.  AWESOME!!!!

I was very disappointed in the recipe. It got so many good reviews, so I expected it to be good. I love cornbread, but I didn't like this much at all.

These are easy to make and delicious.  I like the cupcake texture they have.  And they're good the next day too.

My batter was way to watery and I had to add an extra quarter cup of flour to get a batter consistency. Kind of bland as well, very moist though.

I thought the cornbread muffins turned out really great!  They taste exactly how I expected them to.  I greased the muffin tin with butter, so the muffins have a lovely, browned outer crust with just a bit of crunch!  Yummy!

Just came out of my oven!  I halved the recipe and made 24 mini-muffins.  Took about 11 minutes in my oven.  Came out PERFECT.  Very tasty! My three year old approves :)

These muffins turned out perfect! I like mine to be a little sweeter, though. Next time I will use 1/2 cup of sugar.

This recipe was good. Moist, fluffy, and sweet enough to satisfy my husband (who likes it more cake-like) and dry and savory enough to satisfy me (I prefer it a bit more traditional). I used an 8x8 pan instead of muffins, and baked for 45 min. Also, the one carton of buttermilk I had didn't end up being enough, so I had to use half buttermilk and half milk. It still had good texture, although I think when I make again with two cups of buttermilk, it will have better flavor.

We liked the muffins very much, I am not a big fan of sweet corn bread and I found these to be very moist and tasty. Thanks!

This recipe was okay, but nothing amazing.  The muffins didn't really rise, so they were pretty flat, and they had a grainy texture and not much flavor.
