My grandson loves clementines and asked for a clementine cake for his birthday.  I didn't think there was such a thing, but I found it here.  I only added the zest of one clementine and used 2 cake boxes since they were gluten free (Betty Crocker) and don't rise as much as the gluten cakes.  I did not slice each cake in half, lengthwise, so I ended up with 4 layers.  The cake was delicious!
