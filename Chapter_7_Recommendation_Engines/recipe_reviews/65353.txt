This is a family favorite for over 30 years.  It is so quick and easy to make.  Instead of using the evaporated milk, I just use regular milk because I have it in the house.  Also we do not add the toffee!  Fantastic recipe!

boooo. We did not enjoy these at all. The semi sweet choco-chips were bitter against the baked dough which was dry and tasteless. Could hardly taste the peanut butter as well.
