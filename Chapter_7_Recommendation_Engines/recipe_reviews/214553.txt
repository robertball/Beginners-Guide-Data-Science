I used ground turkey patties because my family doesn't like to eat chicken breasts in a sandwich. Very tasty and everyone agreed they would eat them again. Grill the pineapple too and if you want an extra treat put the pineapple in a bowl with its juice and brown sugar before placing it on the grill, then put it on the sandwich.

My husband and I really loved this recipe. I did cook the chicken in a crock pot on high for almost 4 hours soaking in the soy sauce & I did add brown sugar to it as well. I did grill the chicken and I did grill the bacon and put it together just as the recipe stated. It all came out very tasty and will be making this many times again!

This was good but I think it needed brown sugar added to the soy sauce. The soy was a little over powering. My daughter said it needed a little sweetness. I will try this the next time I make this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Simple and great tasting! You can even shred the chicken if you don't like eating chicken breast whole.

Wow!  I loved this sandwich.  I marinated the chicken with Kikkoman Teriyaki Sauce & Marinade.  I put it in a ziploc bag and add 1 fresh clove of garlic, grated, and 4 green onions, sliced.  I sprinkled brown sugar on the pineapple and grilled that for about 4 minutes.  I used a thicker teriyaki sauce to brush on my chicken at the end.  It was also from Kikkoman, but had sesame seeds in it.  I took a taste of the chicken when it came off the grill and it was fantastic, however; when I put it on my sandwich, I felt the mayo overpowered it and all I tasted was mayo and not the great teriyaki flavors.  I will definitely skip the mayo next time.  I also didn't use the bacon & tomato.  I was out of bacon and was afraid of pairing the tomato with the pineapple, but I might give it a try next time.

I marinated the chicken in a bottled BBQ marinade (Mama Sita's, Philippino-style) instead of soy as I was low. Let it marinade for about an hour. Didn't butter or grill the bread- I used these new bun 'thins' that are available instead of the traditional ones. I made my own teriyaki-style sauce using 'Baked Teriyaki Chicken' from AR. I used grill pan on the stove-top, then finished them off in the oven at 400F for 20 minutes. I used much more teriyaki sauce than called for for basting. We thought the pineapple was a bit much and would skip it next time, though I went the extra mile and caramelized the rings. I think the mayo can become optional if you use more teriyaki than called for for the chicken- Some guests used mayo, other didn't at all. It was well-liked. Served it with 'Hawaiian Coleslaw' from AR.

Made these last night with my fiance- they are AMAZING! We only had small hamburger buns, so I cut the chicken breasts in 2 so we had 2 little burgers each, and swapped the bacon for turkey bacon, but they were the only deviations. I left the chicken in the soy sauce a bit longer; an hour and a half whilst I went grocery shopping, and the chicken was so tender and yummy straight off the grill!  I thought the pineapple might over-power the taste and make it too sweet, but the flavors complemented each other perfectly. I will definitely be making this again!

!!!!! YUMMMMMMM !!!!!! These were SO good!  I had leftover Teriyaki sauce from "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" recipe, so I sweetened that up just a tad with some pineapple juice and a little brown sugar and used that as both a marinade and while grilled (had separated and reduced the stuff I used while grilling);  Also grilled the pineapple with brown sugar as previously suggested.  Loved the Swiss cheese (was skeptical about that) and nixed the mayo (unnecessary fat) - I swear, my burger was gone in less than 3 minutes.  Served with fries (which I wouldn't recommend - they didn't work with burger).  Will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for recipe!

Really yummy, even after afew changes. I was out of mayonaise so used sour cream & fresh chives instead & didn't even bother with the bacon. I added baby greens (from my garden) tomato, caramelized onions, granny smith apple, pineapple, french cheese & avocado. Thanks for the recipe.

This sandwich takes a little time to put everything together, but it’s a fun way to perk up a piece of chicken.   I used a whole blsl chicken breast that I pounded down with a mallet and cut in half.  The chicken was a little saltier than I would have liked due to the soy sauce.  If I had to do over again, I would just marinade in teriyaki sauce and skip the soy all together.    I wasn’t a big fan of the Swiss cheese and would have preferred something milder like Provolone, but hubby said it was good, so I guess it’s just matter of personal taste.   With the grill already going, I decided to go ahead and grill the pineapple along with the bun to give it a finishing touch.

Really yummy. I marinated my chicken in reduced sodium teriyaki marinade and the soy (low sodium as well), I also added 3 chopped green onions to this and marinated all day. I did not use butter on the rolls and I grilled my pineapple slices as well. Hubby and I went bun-less for carb reasons while the kiddos enjoyed theirs on a roll. Very tasty and easy with a side salad. Thanks!

WOW!  That is what my husband and I both said, which is A LOT coming from my husbands mouth!  lol  The flavor combo in these are so delicious!  Instead of marinating the chicken in soy sauce, I used more teriyaki to marinate them in and had extra to baste after grilling.  I also grilled the pineapple and basted them with the teriyaki sauce.  I did mix part of the juice from the pineapple, in with the teriyaki sauce, to meld the flavors more together.  Also I do suggest if your chicken breasts are extra thick like mine were, to pound and flatten them out to a medium thickness, to be more uniform in shape.  That way when you put them on your burger, they will sit better on the sandwich.  Delicious Delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!  This will be a staple in our house!

These were mmm good. My husband actually used the word "Amazing." I used canned pineapple and poured some of the juice into the marinade. I also cooked it all on my stove in a cast iron skillet.

Bought some chicken breast at the store and was looking at a recipe that wasn't too involved or time consuming and found this. It was delicious! I had two big chicken breasts I cut in half to make four small "patties". I tenderized them a bit before throwing them in a bag with soy sauce, garlic salt, sweet chili sauce and black pepper. After letting it marinate I made a loose foil pouch and cooked them in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes. I made the bacon and fried a few pineapple rings. I put it all on a bun with some feta cheese crumbles. DELICIOUS! I'll make it again for sure!

Cooked the chicken in the crockpot with low sodium soy sauce and brown sugar,  chicken fell apart somewhat so I brushed them with teriyaki sauce and cheese, place on foil and melted cheese in the oven.  Sprinkled pineapple rings with  brown sugar and grilled them. Followed all other steps exactly.  My family loved it and will make these again.

Hubby gave it a 4 & I think it is a 5 star. Will make again but with these changes. We'll probably use can slice pineapple or if a fresh one slice a lot thinner. We'll also cu breast in half for thinner pieces & share  a chicken breast. With a full breast, even sliced for easier grilling it was to much. The fresh sliced pineapple was also to think so everything slid around & was way to messy. We took others suggestion & used 1/8c soy sauce & 1/8c plus of pineapple juice.  Initially I thought the marinade was to overpowering with soy sauce.  We'll have to cut the marinade to compensate for using the 1 chicken breast. Like others you may want to add a tish of brown sugar.

I made these at a family cookout and got rave reviews.  It makes a huge sandwich.  I served it with a Hawaiian Mac salad I found on the internet.

Easy to make and very tasty!  Followed the recipe, added brown sugar to the soy sauce, as others had suggested and to the pineapple as it grilled.  YUM!  Only other change I made was to cook the bacon in the oven, as I was making double of the recipe.  Everyone in the family loved it!

Pretty good! Made it on the stove. I sliced the chicken into strips to cook faster. Put olive oil and a little soy sauce in the bottom of the pan and cooked the chicken on med hi heat, last 10 mins put some teriyaki sause on them. Turned out great!

Quick, and great! Made a double recipe, the family loved it! Soy sauce alone for a marinade would have been too salty, so I cut it with 1 Tbs brown sugar and a 1/3 cup of pineapple juice. I halved and tenderized my chicken breasts with a meat tenderizer as well. That helped result in a very tender chicken fillet.  Will make again!

Pretty good!   Next time, make sure chicken pieces are thin (cut thicker pieces in half top-to-bottom), as there's so much stacked on these that they're hard to eat).  Yummy served with apple cole slaw!

My goodness these were good.  Threw the pineapple slices on the grill also about 5 minutes before the breasts were done. Served with all the condiments listed - juicy, flavorful, fantastic.

I grilled the pineapple slices which added to the open-face presentation. Not being a big fan of bacon (or Spam), I omitted it. I found that a single slice of Swiss cheese  wasn't sufficient to influence the taste of sandwich and recommend two slices of Swiss or trying a less mild cheese for anyone trying this burger. Overall, I found this to be a pretty bland sandwich.

This recipe looked so good I could hardly wait to make it.  I sliced the chicken breasts in half lengthwise to make them thinner, and instead of using bacon I topped each one with a slice of ham, then pineapple and cheese.  I served them without a bun, with rice as a side.  I made these for company and they were a hit!  I'll definitely make them again!  So easy and so delicious!

So good.  Seems like a lot of stuff on there, but everything works.  Didn't think I would like the bacon on it, but it really works.

Perfect! I used Hawaiian sweet bread buns and it was the perfect "Aloha" touch. Oh, also cooking the bacon on the grill was a nice touch too.

I gave this 4 stars because I tweeked it a bit and they came out perfect! I used ground chicken marinated in teriyaki sauce, I grilled the pineapple slices and I used pepper jack cheese and turkey bacon. I'm making these for a 2nd time tonight and I can't wait! I'm going to pair this with a nice light salad and citrus vinaigrette.

Great! Marinated in soy sauce and br sugar, basted with teriyaki on grill. Used farmers market chicken and bacon. Melted deli Swiss. Grilled pineapple and wild rice buns from duluth. Served with sliced potato with olive oil and sea salt at 400 for 20 min. needs a really hearty bun. not as good on homemade honey wheat

My whole family really liked this recipe, I found the chicken a little bland, but altogether it was a really good sandwich. I used two slices of bacon per sandwich instead of 1 1/2. I mean, really, everything's better with more bacon!
