You have to give anything this fast, healthy and so full of flavor a 5.  Note this isn't a recipe for small children or others with a tongue that can't handle heat.  I'd cut back on the red pepper quite a bit if you want to achieve that.  For me, however, the recipes worked perfectly as is.  As others suggested I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and it's worth noting that this great sauce can be made well in advance, heck, keeping some in the fridge handy for those days you just don't fee like cooking.

This was by far the best stir fry-ish recipe I have ever made at home. I would suggest it to anyone! The ginger is a must, and keep the same amount of red pepper, because the spiciness is perfect! Just one note: if you decide to add frozen/fresh veggies (we did), be sure to double or even triple the liquid ingredients (we tripled them and it was perfect) like someone earlier suggested.

This recipe had a similar taste to General Tsao's Chicken found on this site but was much healthier!  The recipe is good as is!
I have however,  made it numerous times and have adjusted a few things to my liking.  I like to double the sauce, decrease the hot peppers and only use 1 teaspoon of oil.  I also have found that using uncooked, peeled and deveined shrimp gives the dish a much better taste.  I just cook it in the oil until opaque before adding the sauce.  I just tried adding pea pods at the end, just until heated through, which was a great asian compliment to the meal.  We always serve it over botan rice.  A wonderful low fat, low calorie meal!

i would recomend using raw shrimp as they cook so quickly. pre cooked shrimp come out rubbery while the raw ones will be nice and tender. try tossing in some bay scallops too.

I give this 4 and a half stars, but only because I didn't think up this recipe first!  It tastes very much like what you would get at the restaurant.  I made it twice, both were very good. I added one bag of stir fry veggies, the frozen kind, just prepare in the microwave and drain well before adding to the finished shrimp mixture. Could use fresh veggies as well, but I like the frozen. I also tried crushing 2 of the cloves of garlic and adding them to the sauce and using the remaining 2 cloves as recipe says, it gives the sauce a more garlic flavor.Also be careful not to overcook the shrimp!

Good recipe, but really, ground ginger? Go all out and put some real ginger in, it makes the depth of flavor so much more interesting.

AMAZING! This recipe is a perfect mixture of tangy not-to-sweet sauce and a little bite of spicy-ness. It really only took 20 minutes (what I thought was amazing!). One suggestion though, if you are making this recipe use 6 tablespoons of water (not 4) and use more olive oil when cooking. Also, don't let the smell of the sauce confuse you at first, I thought it was disguisting too. But, when you cook it the sauce gets REALLY yummy! This recipe was amazing and I deffintaly recomend this!

I have a very similar recipe to this one.  It calls for 1 lb shrimp, fresh ginger, garlic, Tbsp rice wine & I add one can chopped stewed tomatoes.  It doesn't really need the honey because the stewed tomatoes give it sweetness.  Served with rice this recipe with these additions makes it 5 stars & a wonderful meal for family or guests.  You won't have any leftovers !

Used 2#s of raw shrimp, tripled the sauce and added just a little more red pepper flakes as we like things SPICY. There wasn't any left, even my 4 year old cleaned his plate! Goes perfect with either steamed or fried rice. Thanks for a super easy, way yummy recipe!

It bothers me to no end when people give recipes less stars than it deserves for dumb reasons like my kid doesn't like shrimp...then don't make a shrimp recipe. But anyway.....this recipe is so deserving of all 5 stars. It is healthy, flavorful and so easy. Wonderful recipe..it is now a staple in my weekly menu.

This was very good.  I did do this a little differently for fear of the shrimp getting too rubbery from being over cooked.  Cooked the shrimp first then added the green onions and garlic to cook....then the sauce.  Let it bubble away for about 10 minutes and added the shrimp back for a minute or so just to reheat.  Also added fresh ginger instead of ground and just a little brown sugar to the sauce.  Delicious, thanks for the post.

I did make a few changes, but this is really a great recipe.  I used fresh shrimp and broccoli.  Next time I make this, I will double the sauce.  I served it over rice noodles.  Rice will be good as well.

OMG! This was SO good! I am 100% pleasantly surprised. Another bonus? My hubby's favorite style of Chinese cooking is Szechwan! I like shrimp, but most often when I marinate or add sauce to them, I am left with BLAND shrimp (i.e. the shrimp don't soak up any of the marinade / sauce). That certainly wasn't the case here! This sauce is sooooo flavorful and it coats the shrimp nicely. As many others suggested, I too doubled the sauce, but in retrospect, don't think that was necessary. I had MORE than enough sauce to cover my 1 lb. bag of shrimp (not wanting to waste the remaining 1/4 lb., I used the entire bag). I do, however, think it's imperative to double or even triple the sauce if you plan to add veggies (they will soak up a LOT of sauce). And, on that note.... Although unappealing at first (the sauce smells horrid when initially mixed), the sauce ends up being the star here. :) Oh, and uncooked shrimp are NOT necessary. It literally took just a couple minutes for my sauce to thicken, barely enough time to turn my shrimp  to "rubber." Serving over brown rice with a side of steamed broccoli (to appease my broccoli hating hubby, I didn't add it to the entree) made this OUTSTANDING. Fortune cookies and iced green tea completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, FOODGU1! :-)

Great! I would suggest adding a bit of some fresh sesame seeds. That little  special flavor and 'crunch' is wonderful.

this is a great start up recipe that you can very easily adjust to your liking. I followed instructions exactly at first, minus the hot pepper flakes since I have young kids. I also added colorful bell pepper chunks, tripled the honey, and at the very last minute, added pineapple! my only recommendation is to add your cooked shrimp last, after the sauce has thickened.

Family liked this VERY much...doubling the sauce is a definate must...will make again but will probably back off the ketchup a tad and up the soy sauce a smidge...will also use fresh ginger...all in all, a good recipe to fine tune to your own liking...thank you, FOODGU1

My family loved this one. I added an extra teaspoon of ginger and less red pepper as my family doesn't like spicy food that much. I also added some vegetables: 8 oz of broccoli crowns 6 oz snow peas, sliced on the diagonal in half 6 oz of carrot "chips" (slices of carrots)

This was a decent recipe.  It was missing something.  Kind of watery and bland.  I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly.  Next time I will do a 1/2 water 1/2 soy sauce mixture for the base, w/ red pepper powder & chili peppers. Maybe even tomatoe paste instead of ketchup for richness. Also much better with fresh shrimp as opposed to pre cooked.

This is a very easy dish to make at the last minute. I have made this a half dozen times and most of the time it’s a last minute decision. You DO NOT have to spend big bucks on the shrimp to make this dish. I always keep a bag of “Sam’s Club” cooked shrimp in the freezer for a quick meal and it works great for this recipe.  The shrimp are run under cold water for 5-10 minutes to thaw, then peeled and ready for the pan.  I recommend you quadruple the sauce! The ingredients are cheap, the sauce is great and since my recommendation is to since this over penne pasta, (or rice) more sauce is needed. In my view, the recipe recommendation quantity of crushed red pepper results in a “medium to mild” on my hot taste scale. I have doubled the pepper which results in a “hot” rating and also have cut it in half for very mild when serving this to young children. Be sure to decide where you want this to be on the “hot taste scale” before you add the pepper. It’s a great recipe but if you don’t measure carefully, you can easily make this too hot for some palates.

OMG, best shrimps ever!  Solid reicpe, easy and quick, and out of the world tasty!!  Here are some tips from a Chinese girl if you want even more authentic flavor:

-Use 1.5-2 lbs raw shrimp(you can buy the peeled frozen shrimps with tail on)!  This alone will kick this dish up a couple notches since the raw ones get more shrimp flavor in.
-Use fresh ginger!
-Triple the sauce, leave out the starch till the end (only use 1 TBS of corn starch, dilute in about 2 TBS water), I also added about 1 TBS of rice vinegar,  the sauce was sooooooooooo yummy to eat with rice.

Here is how I made it with the above changes.  Heat up about 2-3 TBS of grapeseed oil(shrimps are very low cal, so don't feel bad for adding some oil here), cut up about at least 1 thumb size of fresh ginger(first cut into match sticks, then cut into tiny bits), cut up 1-2 small bunch of green onions(white and light green part only).  Fry them up till fragrant, toss in the thawed and drained shrimps, fry for 1-2 minutes over high heat, then pour in the tripled sauce, boil for 1-2 minutes, add the starch solution, stir. Add salt. Done!

Best ever shrimps hands down!!! gotta try it.

This is awesome!  We're not Chinese food eaters, so I can't compare to the restaurant version, but this is awesome!  I doubled the sauce and left out the ginger (I knew that would make it too *Asian* for Mr. LTH).  I also added more garlic than called for.  I added a bag of fresh stir fry veggies to the pan when I added the shrimp (frozen pre-cooked, mostly thawed & de-tailed).  I served over brown rice.  This is so simple, so quick, and so yummy it will def become a regular at the LTH house...I'm already looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!!!  BTW-this made enough for dinner for both of us and 1 leftover portion for lunch tomorrow.  TY for a great recipe!

This recipe is awesome, especially considering how fast and easy it is! I used uncooked jumbo shrimp- just tossed them in the hot oil and garlic, along with some sugar snap peas and water chestnuts. Stirred in the sauce as soon as the shrimp was pink and opaque. I will probably make this once a week.

Very good. Doubled the sauce, used fresh ginger, added a splash of rice wine vinegar and served with stir-fried broccoli over rice. Even the kiddo's loved it. Thanks FOODGU1

Loved this! Not only is it extremely tasty, it's extremely easy - two key characteristics of a great recipe! One tip: use raw shrimp and sauté them lightly before adding the sauce. They're much better and not as rubbery as frozen cooked shrimp.

This is by far the best stir fry I have ever made and it is now my go-to recipe. I made some adjustments based on my pantry: I used raw shrimp, I shaved fresh ginger (I keep one in the freezer at all times), and I replaced the red chili flakes with a little squirt of siracha sauce because I don't like really spicy food and it gave me the right heat.  My husband cleaned his plate and we discussed how awesome this would be as a beef marinade for the grill.

It was ok. I have had way better at a restaurant, so I think that has ruined this recipe for me. Otherwise I;m sure it's a dececnt one as far as price goes etc.

OH MY GOODNESS, this was fabulous!  Never thought I could make chinese food like PF Changs, but with this recipe it was possible!  The flavor was perfect.  Added steamed brocolli & carrots.  Didn't have precooked shrimp so I cooked the shrimp in the oil and garlic before adding the sauce and vegetables.  Served over brown rice. Whenever I have chinese I have to make the "chinese condiment" of spicy mustard, chile paste, & soy sauce for a little extra kick.  Tripled the recipe which was way too much.  Doubling would be PLENTY.  TRY THIS RECIPE!

This is good, but you should use uncooked shrimp(whether fresh or frozen). Shrimp that is precooked and then cooked again is overcooked! Not very good. And I keep fresh ginger in the freezer and then grate what I need-easy and tastes fresh.

This was delicious!!! My husband and I absolutely loved it! I used Thai sweet chili sauce in place of the ketchup and doubled the sauce recipe, then I served it over rice. I will definitely be making this again!

Like the picture, I added broccoli florets at the same time the shrimp went in.  Also, I only had terriyaki marinade (no soy sauce) so I used that - it was wonderful!!! I added a little lemon juice before service to give it a citrus flavor and WOW!!!  I could become addicted....

The reason I'm giving this only 3 stars is because the ingredient amounts need to be adjusted. The ketchup was really overpowering and dominated the flavor of the dish; 2 teaspoons of honey was a tad too sweet; it wasn't nearly spicy enough to be called szechwan and surprisingly, seemed to need even more red pepper than half a teaspoon AND the amount of cornstarch was WAY off. I'd say to cut it back by half if you don't want your sauce to turn to paste. I think the idea of this recipe has potential, but far too much "tweaking" would be required to get there from here. You'd have to just about re-write the entire recipe to make it come out good.

This recipe is fantastic!!  NOT ketchupy at all.  The sauce is very similar to the sauce served at my favorite Hibachi restaurant!!  It makes your whole house smell awesome.  My father and hubby went wild over this and can't wait until I make it again.  Two thumbs up!!

Wonderful! The only changes I made were minor. I double the sauce, peel and de-veined my own raw pink shrimp (cooked them up until they had a nice colors then threw in the sauce), and lastly I added some pea pods in. None of ingredients (besides a little fresh ginger as well as powdered) were changed and it was the perfect amount of spice! Served over brown rice to keep the calories low

I just can't believe how good this tastes for how easy it is!  I did as some other reviewers suggested and tripled the sauce portion, since I wanted to add in some veggies (one bag frozen snap peas, one bag frozen stir-fry pepper mix).  It was PERFECT.  Just the right amount of sauce! Since I had fresh shrimp, I cooked them first and set them to the side before completing the recipe as written.  Amazing!  I'll definitely be making this fairly often!

I have made this recipe twice and both times the shrimp was awesome and everyone raved about it.  The second time I added a little Chili Garlic Sauce found in the Chinese section for some more heat, but this recipe is a total WOW!  And so easy too!

Great recipe!  Easy!  Fast!  I don't rate a lot of recipes as 5 star but this definitely is.  I don't understand giving a lower rating because someone didn't think of it themselves.  The ginger comments are a personal preference.  I personally don't like fresh so the ground dry works better for me.  I do agree with doubling the sauce.  Frozen shrimp work well....just make sure you don't put them in for very long and overcook them.  This is a real keeper.  THANKS!

Great!  I made a few changes though. I doubled the sauce like everyone else suggested, only I put it a little less ketchup and a little more soy sauce. I also used Low Sodium soy sauce instead of the regular stuff.  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of Honey to kick up the sweetness. It ended up being a perfect balance between sweet and spicy.  I tossed in some Broc/Corn/Red Pep veggie mix for color and texture, and I served it over some instant Asian Rice.  The wife really liked it as well, so we will definitely make this again. Remember to ease up on the ketchup a little bit if you are worried about the ketchup taste coming out too much.

I made the sauce exactly as called for in the recipe and all I tasted was a ketchup soy sauce flavor.  Normally I find review averages on this site very helpful, but I don't see it in this recipe.  This ended up in the sink before it had a chance to contaminate my shrimp.

This is a lovely dish. So quick and so easy. I didn't change anything except doubling the sauce. The beauty of this recipe is that it's so quick and easy and uses simple ingredients you can have on hand any time. Fresh shrimp? Yes, perhaps it would make it better, but, it would also add, not only to cooking time, but to availability of ingredients. Frozen is already in your freezer, fresh needs a trip to the store AND needs to be peeled and deveined. Some people prefer fresh ginger, some, me included, prefer the powdered. As for the hot pepper flakes.... the amount you use depends completely on the pepper flakes you have. I've had some that had almost no heat, then again some that burned the enamel off my teeth. KNOW YOUR PEPPER! And taste the sauce before you add it. Add more if you need it. The basic recipe is what I gave 5 stars for. I can add anything I want to that, and it won't change my rating. Thank you for a great recipe. I'm going to try it with some cooked, frozen turkey meat I have in the freezer. I have no doubt it will be fabulous.

I did not care for this at all, but the bf liked it, so it gets two stars.  I was wary of the ketchup and my fears were confirmed ... it tasted like a sauce made with ketchup and was not good.

This tasted great and my husband raved.  Next time, I'll definitely add more veggies than this recipe calls for however.  I added mushrooms & snow peas but it still needed more.  This is a wonderful dish though!

I followed this recipe almost exactly...with a few little changes.  I used fresh grated ginger instead of ground, and I also added some fresh sliced carrots and broccoli to the mix.  A little tip: saute the veg in a little olive oil to soften them up before you throw them with the shrimp or else the shrimp will get all rubbery.  Because I added veg, I doubled the sauce recipe which I found was sufficient.  i dont like things too saucy. Also, I found this a little spicy for my taste so if you're like me...you might want to ease back a bit on the chili/ginger.  I will DEFINITELY make this again. :)

Delicious!  I doubled the "sauce" amount because I wanted extra for the rice.  I wasn't sure the sauce would taste as good as it did, but it all came together well in the pan. I steamed some vegetables, and it was a great meal!

Very tasty recipe. I recommend using fresh shrimp to soak up the flavor more.

This was exceptional. The recipe as is, is perfect. But since I'm a saucy person, I tripled the ingredients for this sauce.  I also did this due to the fact that I had added broccoli, zucchini, onion, and celery. One reviewer suggested cutting back on the red chili flakes if anyone eating this doesn't like hot. I agree. I'm guessing the average person wouldn't mind if you cut back a teeny bit. It was just fine for my taste. Surprisingly, I'd have to agree with those who said it was quick to prepare. For me that's usually not the case, but this really was!

Tripled everything so as to add a bag of frozen mixed stir-fry veggies to a lb or so of medium frozen pre-cooked shrimp. Used:  chili sauce instead of ketchup since I had it; about 2 tsp grated frozen ginger; sesame seed oil; and a whole head of garlic (12 cloves.) Would've done the fresh chopped broccoli and slivered carrots instead of frozen vegs, but am making broccoli-cheese soup later this week. Made this a day ahead and just put it all in a glass jar, (oil, uncooked garlic and onions too) shook it well and fridged it. To finish, heated sauce with veggies till thickened, then added thawed shrimp just till heated through. Served over jasmati rice cooked in chicken broth instead of water. 5 stars = good enough to pass on to the daughter!  :)

Easy and smells fantastic while cooking! Substituted  1 tsp. minced fresh ginger for ground and threw that ginger in with the garlic and onions.  My daughter wants to try this sauce with chicken now...

Didn't realize that this said cooked shrimp, ended up using raw. I'd highly suggest it that way. Ohh, man! This was absolutely delicious. I can't rave enough. For such a simple recipe, I was shocked. Definitely throwing this into my weekly rotation (or at LEAST once a month) as I have most everything in my pantry. I used ground ginger instead of the reviewers suggestion to use fresh and it was fabulous. I would highly recommend doubling the sauce per Tony's review, as is is not near enough. Awesome recipe. Husband approved.

This recipe won't change my life, but was good. Didn't have honey so used brown sugar and my green onions had gone bad (thank you walmart) after 2 days so I did without. I quadrupled everything but only tripled the ketchup and ginger. Still a little bit ketchup-y, but not bad for how cheap and easy this is. I only doubled the crushed red pepper because we don't like too much heat. I made this recipe for two. Added peppers and zucchini over white rice and there was quite a bit of sauce left over (with a lot of liquid on the plate). I will make this again, with maybe a few tweaks.

This is really good!  Definitely double the sauce if you're using over rice.  Adding some small cut fresh broccoli is a nice addition.

Excellent. I doubled the sauce but not the ketchup. I only used 1/4tsp red pepper flakes & didn't double that. It had just enough kick to it w/o going overboard.
If you're looking to make it healthy, just omit the rice. It was delicious with out - just make some fresh veggies on the side.

Solid 4 1/2 stars for a quick and tasty shrimp dinner.  I usually double the sauce to have extra to serve on the rice.

Not a fan. I thought it was really pretty tasteless, aside from the red pepper flakes. Luckily I added enough of those to convince my tastebuds that i wasnt eating cotton. For all the different ingredients in the sauce, I would have thought there would be a strong flavor to it, but I tasted nothing. Will not make it again.

This was very good.  I took the advice of a few others, and I tripled the liquid/sauce mix.  I'm glad I did, because it was necessary (this was the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).   I also added a small amount of broccoli florets, baby carrots, and tofu just to give it a little more variety and color.  The amount of red pepper flakes that the recipe called for is the perfect amount.  I wouldn't change that a bit.  It had just enough kick to be spicy, but not too much to be overwhelming.  I will definitely make this again. :)

This was good - and the only reason I gave it four stars was because I tripled the sauce recipe and it was so spicy!  I was sweating - but I loved it.  My husband loved it and said 'Now this is GOOD!"  So - if you triple the sauce...maybe don't triple the crushed red pepper.  I will definitely make this again.  And since we love spice...probably exactly like this.  We both drank 3 pints of water each during this meal.  :)
**Second Review - I made this again and it was so good.  I tripled the sauce recipe and there was a ton of thick bubbly sauce. I served it over rice and I wish I had made more rice to help sop up the sauce.  Nice and spicy - not as bad as last time though because I only doubled the crushed red pepper.  :)

very good!  I cut back on the crushed red pepper flakes ONLY because I've not tolerated spicy food lately.  Will keep this on the shrimp rotation.  

and people who put up there own recipe and give the existing recipe low ratings--here's a clue.  I DO NOT care what your recipe calls for or that you do this because your 2 year old doesn't like 3/4 of the ingredients!  you skew the rating by doing this.  If you want people to know about YOUR recipe put it up on the site!

If I could have had thirds, I would have definitely done so, instead I had to settle for seconds. I agree fresh shrimp would have been better, but this was a quick and easy meal. I increased the sauce and added green peppers, onions and peas. My very picky eater actually polished off the dish - the reason I didn't have thirds. It was a pleasant surprise and a dish I will make again.

I made this exactly as the recipe directs because I think that's important the first time you're trying a recipe you haven't tasted before. Otherwise your review isn't worth much, in my opinion.
Having made it once, I thought it was pretty good but could be improved upon with the addition of water chestnuts and crunchy broccoli. I also used fresh shrimp and sauteed them in a chili oil and sesame oil combination. Really added a nice extra zip. Since we're not huge fans of ginger, I reduced it a titch, maybe half. I chose to serve it over rice noodles (we need to watch carbs) and it was delicious.

This was awesome. I am glad I trusted the reviews. I used raw jumbo shrimp and left out the red pepper flakes, we don't like too much spice. After a two minutes in the pan I added fresh brocoli. This cooked beautifully.

This was great, easy, and quick. I tripled the sauce for a pound of shrimp, but probably could have just doubled it. Also, next time I would add the shrimp last because I used precooked shrimp and it was a little overcooked by the time the sauce got thick. Served over minute rice for a quick healthy and delicious meal.

I used chicken broth instead of water and Heinz Spicy Ketchup instead of regular and still found this rather bland. I omitted the green onion, doubled the crushed peppers and added 1 Tbsp of hot chille sauce. This made it nearly perfect! If it had the green onions I would have enjoyed it even more. 
I used this as a stir fry sauce and added it to shrimp, broccoli and red peppers, and mixed it with Cantonese noodles.

After making it, I'm surprised that the recipe was rated so high. I doubled the sauce ingredients and was looking forward to a great Szechwan flavor that was not to be found. Also don't understand those that talk about the heat, for me there was no heat!

This received mixed reviews here.  I doubled the sauce, added fresh, chopped veggies, and had to cut the red pepper a little bit for our tastes.  It is easy to make and very spicy.

This reminded me of something that McDonald's would come up with and call it "stir fry".  I followed the recipe to a T, and when I tried it, I couldn't get the ketchup-y taste out of my mouth.  Needless to say, I'll definitely not make this ever again.

This was good - I used raw shrimp and sauteed it as suggested by another reviewer, and then aded the sauce - which I tripled.  My husband really liked it - but I thought the ketchup taste was a bit too apparent - could have been the tripling:>).  Will definitely make again - with less ketchup.  Easy and low calorie too.

This is gross.  I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce- big mistake.  The sauce is grossed and drowned all the other flavors.  I added broccoli and bamboo shoots and ultimately tossed this stuff in the trash.

I enjoyed this recipes a lot.  It was simple, and I had all the ingredients in my house, I didn't have to go make a special shopping trip, and the taste was excellent!  Even my picky husband enjoyed it and said it was a recipe we could keep.  I doubled the recipe like everyone said because I added extra veggies, broccoli, red pepper, green pepper and mushrooms.  The only change I made to the sauce was instead of using water, I used reduced sodium chicken broth for a bit of an added flavour.  Very yummy!  Would love to try this with chinese noodles.  Definatly a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

So easy to make, and my husband and I loved it! I doubled the sauce recipe (but left ginger amount the same) which is a must, and also added about 1/8 cup of chili garlic sauce to the sauce. It had a great kick. Used uncooked shrimp, and cooked it in the sauce. Delicious, thanks!

This was a great starter recipe.  I doubled the sacue.  I added diagonal sliced carrots and more green onion than stated.  For the sauce I added Red Chili Pepper blend I had in the fridge.  ( I comes in tubes in the produce area)  It added a nice flavor to the dish.  I also added more Red pepper flakes than called for as we like it hot.  This was good and we will make it again.  I added a little more honey becaue the sweet hot thing really works.

I chose this recipe to use up some shrimp I had on hand.  I was inspired by the reviews, and thought I'd give the recipe a shot.  I guadrupled the sauce, as suggested in earlier reviews, doubled the garlic and ginger.  I also added some vegetables.  My shrimp was raw, and I cooked it 2-3 minutes before adding the sauce.  I think the sauce has too much ketchup.  Something about the sauce was a little off.  Another reviewer mentioned that it tasted like a frozen Green Giant ready-meal.  I think so too.  To me, this tasted like something that came out of a bag.  I ate it, but I'm not looking forward to having to eat the leftovers.  Sorry!

We added well drained frozen vegetables & doubled the sauce as others suggested.
(We used ½ the microwave time on the frozen vegetables to insure they wouldn’t be over-cooked.)  The sauce is excellent w/ chicken.  We served over Japanese noodles.  Very easy w/ great spice & flavor!!!

I liked this very much. It didn't look or taste very promising just going by the made up sauce ingredients. The garlic and onion really rounded out the flavour. Be sure to double the sauce. I did not completely double the red pepper flakes-used a scant 3/4 tsp-. The spice level was tastable but not burning. My 12yr. old son had chosen to have spagetti instead of this for his dinner but I found him over the fry pan with a fork, eating the shrimp with a grin on his face. This was extreemly fast to put together. I served over rice, squeezed with a little lime juice and sprinkled  very lightly with salt. Thank so much.

I tried this, not quite sure what to expect - it was VERY good.  The only change I made was I replaced the honey with about 1/2 tsp sugar, as I don't like honey.  This tasted like General Tao chicken sauce.  I would have added abit more crushed chilies as I like it HOT but it was fine like this also.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Eureka!  I found the "what's missing" for my family.  The sauce is a lot like sweet and sour, but no sour.  I doubled the sauce as recommended (triple it even, it won't be too much!) and added 2 tbsp. of lemon juice just before serving.  Mmmm.  Really helped!

I ended up making a very large serving of this dish so the taste may have been altered slightly. Yet I found the dish to be really tasty. There was quite a kick of spice that lingered after the initial bite. I added more garlic to the dish and I think it added a really good flavor. I also added onion, green pepper and mushrooms and lobster pieces. Very good. I would definately do again but make for a smaller group.

I made this for my husband's bithday dinner.  He was concerned that I would be in the kitchen and not able to spend time with the family.  So we both wanted something quick and easy.  This was both!  I doubled the recipe. My husband and children love shrimp and they all really enjoyed this sauce.  I avoided the shrimp and ate just sauce over rice - very good!  I think I will try it with chicken sometime.  You could not tell this had ketchup in it!  I did not put in much red pepper, fearing it would be too hot for the children- still delicious.  THANKS!

Excellent recipe FOODGU1!  Don't be scared away by the ketchup... this sauce is fantastic!  And so quick -- it was ready before the broccoli side finished steaming in the microwave!  Next time I'll double the sauce.

I tripled the sauce amount and added 2 more extra garlic cloves. I'm going to used bigger shrimps next time and add sriracha because it wasn't spicy enough for me. It goes well with brocolli added in as well!

This was perfect for a weeknight meal.  Quick, easy, & lots of flavor!  It wasn't overly sweet and had a kick of spice! I did use fresh shrimp and I highly recommend using fresh ginger over ground.

I regularly make this recipe and make it exactly as written. To get in some veggies I'll add in fresh broccoli and mushrooms just before adding the shrimp - and if incorporating veggies to the recipe I'll triple the sauce. I serve this over the Asian Coconut Rice recipe on this site.

This dish was so delicious and so simple to make.  Both my husband and I loved it.  I did use uncooked shrimp and fresh ginger.  Also took previous reviewers suggestion and doubled the sauce.  Per my husband's request, I may use a bit less red pepper flakes next time (I thought the heat was perfect).  Will try this with chicken and salmon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is easy & full of flavor & makes such a pretty presentation.
I tripled the sauce ingredients to 1 1/4 lb. uncooked, deviened shrimp (Tails off). Shrimp cooks  fast, so be prepared to remove the pan from the heat as soon as they are pink & serve right away. . I did stir in al dente precooked snap peas & thinly-cut carrots for color. Serve over brown or white rice. YUM

OK, nothing special.  I thought the sauce was a little too "ketchupy" for our likes.  I don't think we'll make this again - I like shrimp too much to use it in a "just ok" recipe.

I did not like this dish -- but Husband did, so I  gave it 3 stars. I  made it, because of all the 5 star ratings?? I agree with some, who said  there is too much ketchup flavor -  maybe 1 T would be enough and more honey. I made double sauce like evreyone was saying,  but it was too much! I wanted my shrimp to  have  more glazed appearance like  the  restaurants  serve. I  would do single sauce next time less ketchup more sweetner....if I make again! and it did not meet 5 stars in my opinion -disapointed!

Made per recipe.  No changes.  I served over rice.  Without broccoli or some kind of texture and flavor to blend out the sauce ... no good.

Very good, the shrimps were lovely.  I added broccoli, doubled the sauce and used raw shrimps.  Only problem was that my noodles didn't cook right. But that's no fault to the recipe.

It was really easy and very good. I started with uncooked shrimp, and I doubled the sauce. I served it with brown rice and green beans.

This recipe is amazingly easy and tastes so good. I pretty much followed it as it is listed, making these additions.... When I added the shrimp, I also added broccoli and pine nuts. Just as it was finished, I added mango long enough only to heat the mango, around twenty seconds.  Other changes were fresh ginger and extra red pepper flakes. Great dinner! I'll be making this again. Next time I plan to add water chestnuts as well.

It's delicious, quick and healthy.  I agree with the other reviews that you need to double the recipe especially if you add veggies to the mix. I added a bit more honey and loads more chilli flakes and pre-cooked broccoli - served over brown rice.  Also fresh ginger is a must!

I give this recipe a 5 after tweaking it a little after reading the reviews. I tripled the sauce (we like sauce), cut the ketchup down to 1 Tbsp. plus a little extra squeeze, added an extra 1/2 tsp. soy sauce and a splash of terriyaki plus fresh garlic about 1 clove(let sauce marinade overnight) and some par-boiled asparagus. My husband loved it. We've been married for 10 years and my husband (a gourmet chef) didn't know I could cook until last week I started looking up healthy recipes, since i am on a diet. We're on our second honeymoon!

One review I read said if your tongue can't handle the heat, reduce the red pepper.  I'm not big on spicy; however, my husband is.  I tried the recipe exactly just to see how much I could handle.  I poured myself a glass of milk to assist if needed.  It was spicy, but it was manageable for me.  I took a sip of milk every 2 or 3 bites to reduce the fire on my tongue.  I thought it tasted fantastic, although it could have used a little salt.  Next time I make it, I will reduce the pepper to 1/4 tsp and add a dash of salt.

Unfortunately, my husband and I didn't like this much.  It wasn't awful or anything, but we didn't care for the strong ketchup-y taste (and I even used less than called for).

Great recipe that hits all the right notes for an Asian flavor profile.  Some people recommended reducing the heat but I added even more by subbing ketchup with Saracha :)  Also used freshly grated ginger which I imagine is better than ground ginger. Was an eye-watering move but totally worth it.  Very satisfying dish, definitely worth a try and has become my new go-to.

Used chili sauce instead of ketchup.  Increased water by 2 TBLS.  Used fresh grated ginger.  Wish I had fresh garlic but didn't so used jared instead. Doubled sauce.  Used a medium chopped onion as well as 5 chopped green onions. Cooked onion & garlic in sesame oil 1st then added the sauce mixture to pan and let it thicken-about 8-10 minutes.  Finally, added pre-frozen, thawed shrimp & cooked, shelled edemame.  Cooked until heated through.  Served on top of angel hair pasta.  Broccoli slaw as a side dish.  Yum!

So much better than I thought it would be, plus it was so easy! Best part is that I had all ingredients and could actually make this without looking up substitutions for anything. I did use fresh ginger since I had it left from another recipe and I used raw shrimp. I also added some sugar snap peas in with the shrimp mix and served it with steamed jasmine rice ( yay for rice cookers!).

We enjoyed this dish, but I feel fresh ginger would be better in this too. Also, I used raw shrimp instead of the precooked.

This is my go to recipe for Chinese at home!  In fact, it is better than any takeout!  I double the sauce and add my favorite vegetables, all of which I cook separately (broccoli, peppers, onion, water chestnuts, mushrooms, etc.).  This really is best with raw shrimp.  I cook all the vegetables first and remove them, cover to keep warm, and set aside.  Then I cook as directed and add the vegetables and sauce when the shrimp is "just done" and cooks as directed until thickened.  I serve with rice.  So delicious!!

This is an excellent dish. Even though I doubled the amount of sauce it was still not enough because I also added broccoli and carrots, so if you want to add veggies, make sure you make enough sauce. I also used raw shrimp and cooked it in the oil with the garlic and onion to give it more flavor and used Sambal instead of the crushed red pepper. One last thing, either cut the cornstarch in half or add more water, it's up to you. If you leave it as is, it is extremely thick. Thanks for the recipe, it was delicious!

We aren't big fans of ginger so I did reduce the amount.  The sauce was nice but not so good that I can say with certainty that I'll make this again.

Put the phone down, this is WAY better than any takeout!!!  I made a vegetable LoMein recipe from this site to go along side the shrimp, and baked some egg rolls.  My only change to the recipe was I used fresh minced ginger inplace of the ground ginger powder.

For us, the recipe worked well as written although we used raw wild shrimp. We thought it was mildly spicy but not a ‘hot’ dish (might add a little cayenne pepper next time as one reviewer suggested). It does not taste Szechwan like one typically encounters in a Chinese restaurant but the flavor was still quite good. I agree with many other reviewers about increasing the quantity of sauce. I went with those suggesting tripling the sauce thinking that a bit of extra unused sauce is no big deal. This amount turned out about right for us. The shrimp were served over a bed of white Basmati rice.  Thank you FOODGU1 for sharing this recipe.

Maybe next time I'd use raw shrimp & let the sauce simmer longer. Maybe I'd also double the sauce, or add more red pepper flakes. It was good as written and incredibly fast to the table!

It's very tasty, but it's not szechwan.  But I'll make it again.

Love this! I can bake but cooking is not my forte but this recipe was so easy, quick, and flavorful that I felt like an awesome cook.  While this recipe is really quick, don't forget to plan cook time for your rice if you're not doing the instant stuff.

This was pretty tasty and fairly easy to make.  I used raw shrimp instead, which I think turns out better than cooked.  Also used thinly sliced white onions (didnt have green) and added sliced mushrooms as well... turned out well.

This was so fast and easy to make...and delicious!!  I didn't have honey on hand so I substituted sugar instead.  Not sure how it would have tasted with the honey, but it was quite yummy the way I made it.  :)

this is a keeper!  I read reviews and did the following:  I doubled the sauce recipe, used raw shrimp, and also added carrots, pea pods, and mushrooms to the mix.  Hubby and I both loved it!

I made a few changes - tripled the sauce and added chicken and broccoli because I didn't have enough shrimp.  The sauce was really tasty but next time I might add some orange zest for some brightness - otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  I served this over brown rice.  Never need to call for Chinese take-out again!

Meh.
The only mod I made was I used fresh ginger.  I found this tasted like it came from a jar though.  Actually, the one we have in the jar tastes better.

Amazing Taste!!! Sauce was perfect amount. I used terriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce (because that's what I had in the fridge) and I also used a teaspoon of hot wings sauce instead of the crushed red peppers. It was a bit spicy but sooooo yummy. I boiled 3/4 lb of spagetti, drained and mixed it with the shrimp sauce. It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

Great Recipe! I used Fresh ginger instead of ground and added some aisan veggies at the end. I doubled all sauce ingredients except the red pepper - I kept that at 1/2 tsp. This turned out perfect. Just enough spice to be noticeable, but not so much that the kids wouldn't eat it! Super easy and even the kids gave this recipe 5 stars, I will definately be making it again.

This was really good! I'm only 16 and I JUST made this for my family and my sister kept saying, "This taste like Chinese restaurant food!" My dad said it was good too, but then again he thinks everything is good! It really was easy. I made the recipe as is and plus I added some peas and they went together really well. The sauce was really yummy but maybe I might cut down on the ketchup and maybe add some more water. I don't know if it was just me but the ketchup was a bit, just a bit, overpowering. Very good, I'll make it again!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was probably the best shrimp I've ever made. I followed the recipe except I didn't have any green onion, and I added some lime juice and cayenne pepper for extra heat. Delicious!

I give it a two because I'm sure I could salvage the shrimp for something else. It tasted like watered down ketchup without any tang to it. I didn't put the crush red pepper into the dish because I find it to be too spicy. I also used fresh ground ginger rather than the powdered spice.

Ok..clearly do not know what all the hype about this one is.  Followed recipe perfectly, even added a little more red pepper, and it was 2.5 stars max.  Whole family agreed.  Will not keep this one and will try others maybe more worthy of such popularity.

SO where do I begin? This dish was rather quick to make first off = 1 star maybe 2. I tripled the recipe and got a sauce that was a little thin or soupy consistency. That can also be in part to i only put in about 1/2 tsp of cornstarch and about 3 TBSP of ketchup (to omit the kethchupy taste many other reviews refer to). The final product wasn't bad but it wasn't THAT impressive. This is a good base recipe to build a pond. I used fresh ginger and i assed many different types of veggies for ex. broccoli, bell peppers(red and yellow)...I cooked jasmine rice and carrots in a honey glaze from another recipe that I love. In all next time I make this I will play with it a bit more. Add more seasonings or something. Oh i almost forgot- i also seasoned my RAW shrimp with some season salt and garlic salt (hence i like salt)...

AMAZING!!! So much flavor and so little fat and calories. Very healthy for how much flavor this recipe has. I tripled the sauce like some of the reviewers. I added a bag of frozen pepper/onion medley in with the shrimp and it was perfect!

Just made this for the first time and it was FANTASTIC!  I added in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies (once cooked and drained) and tripled the sauce (everything in step #1) - otherwise followed the recipe as is.  The amount of spice was perfect for us.

This was delicious, so easy, and the boyfriend loved it.  If you don't like spice, just use a pinch of the red chili peppers.  The 1/2 teaspoon is pretty spicy, but it meshes with the dish well.

No need to use cornstarch if you don't have it - just sprinkle in a 1/2 tsp of flour after pouring the sauce in the pan - just to thicken it up a little bit.

Prep time is practically nothing, and the cooking time is only 10 minutes.  Perfect, easy, fast, delicious.

Goes well over a bed of couscous and with some steamed broccoli.

Not bad, but definitly missing something.  I tasted the spice from the red peppers, but it still needs something to give it a little oomph.  I made about 50% more sauce and put it over steamed rice.  It's a good start and I'll no doubt play with it again, maybe more honey, I think it should be more sweet...possibly more soy sauce...I used low sodium and I think it could have benefitted from a touch more salt.

It was quick and easy, but didn't really taste at all "authentic" (ok, I admit I'm not close to an expert in authenticity!).

I hate to say this...I really do...but today's high-end sauces are so delicious, diverse, and easy that it's just a lot more time-friendly to use one instead of putting together this admittedly great recipe.  Homemade is always best, especially when you can control the ingredients and avoid preservatives.  Not to mention the usually superior taste and the satisfaction of presenting a dish you are proud of having put together yourself.  But since this isn't really all natural anyway...I say go with the best of the best jar stuff added to raw shrimp sauteed in garlic and oil.   I love cooking. But sometimes it's not the best use of my time for the relative trade-off in taste.

I had been wanting Chinese food for a while, but we're trying not to eat out if we can help it. I had low expectations of this dish because most of my attempts in the past have not been good, but boy was I wrong! It really tasted like take out and only cost a fraction. I used raw shrimp and doubled the sauce since I added frozen veggies. Hubby liked it, too.

This recipe turned out to be a great one-pan lunch option for my other half and I. The sauce was quick to make and the ingredients were mostly things I already had on hand, making it extra affordable. We served it with a pouch of instant rice with some red peppers mixed into the sauce. Overall it had a very nice flavour and satisfied our craving for Chinese food!   That being said, the sauce does have a certain "ketchup-y" flavour (I thought it tasted similar to a chinese sweet and sour sauce), so if you're not a ketchup lover be warned! We put in about 3/4 of the recommended spice, and thought it was mild enough to use the full 1/2 tsp next time. Also used Sesame Oil instead of Vegetable, and if you have it on hand I would definitely recommend using it instead!

The sauce was very good. I think next time I will fry the shrimp and then mix them in the sauce.  I also would definitely double the sauce recipe.  I served it over a bed of sushi rice.

Great recipe, spice was fine for us. Like another reviewer, I added snow peas and tripled the sauce for the amount of shrimp used. The only other change was to shake the shrimp in some corn starch, and stir fried them first for some crunch, removed them before stir frying the veggies and garlic, added the sauce and then the shrimp were returned to the pool. This is a keeper

This was great, not too spicy, not too sweet. Definitely double the sauce if you are having rice or vegies with it. I cooked a frozen mix of stirfry vegies, and the sauce tasted great with it!

This was easy, flavorful and good, but there's no way this was four portions. I would put it at two. Make sure you at least double the recipe if you are serving four!

Very yummy!  I trippled the sauce reciepe and followed everything to the T.  The flavor was delicious, but it was a little on the spicy side for me (made the eyes water and definitely cleared out my sinuses!).  I will be making this again, it was so easy and not too expensive.  However, i will scale back on the red peppers!

This just wasn't much to our liking.  I liked the concept but will stick to my other Asian shrimp recipes.  I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't horrible and it we were able to eat it.  Grumpy didn't care for it at all.

This was really a wonderful recipe. I like to try recipes where there are not too many ingredients, or steps.I mix the "sauce" ingredients ( with  1/2  of the minced garlic added)and keep it ready in the fridge, in a small ziploc onions and garlic chopped and ready to go, and carrots and broccoli  sliced in another ziploc, as soon as the kids get home I heat oil ,throw in the onions/garlic,then the veges,then the shrimp ,then the sauce...it's all hot and bubbly ,ready to eat in 10 minutes. I have made it thrice so far, once with shrimp ,twice with chicken breasts ,(cubed,seasoned with salt/paprika ,sprinkle  cornflour and all purpose flour little to coat)....Thanks !

My husband loves chinese food, so I figured I'd try my hand at this one.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.  I smells great in the making and tastes great in the eating.  I did not alter the recipe on bit. I would possibly try a little less ketchup the next time.

This was fantastic.  I doubled everything in the sauce except the chili flakes and I left the ginger out all together (personal preference).  I used fresh shrimp, threw them in at the last minute with some sugar snap peas and served over white rice.  Absolutely delicious.

This recipe is quick and outstanding!  I  used fresh veggies - snow peas, baby squash & zucchini, sliced carrots - along with the spring onions and garlic.  A great blend of flavors.  Served this on top of a bed of bulgur wheat.

Very yummy recipe. I tripled the recipe and added chili paste instead of the crushed chili's and it definitely left your mouth tingly, but was perfect. Even my kids chowed down on this. I also added chunks of red and yellow bell pepper, a sweet onion and water chestnuts because they have a great texture. I added some fresh ginger in with the garlic and a splash of sesame oil. I served over jasmine rice. It was perfect and really fast. I even ate leftovers for breakfast. Nothing like nice spicy food in the morning to wake you up. I definitely recommend this recipe, its so versatile and you make it to suit your tastes.

Not very authentic. I found the aroma of the dish to be a bit of a turnoff. The seafood smell comes from using "cooked shrimp." To get rid of the smell and to make it more tender, it is best to cook the shrimp through with oil first or add some cooking wine to get rid of some of the seafood smell although it doesn't work as well as oil

This was really really good and super easy. Plus, I love the fact that it's so low in calories. (good for us dieters) I doubled the sauce so we would have extra for the rice and broccoli I served. At the suggestion of others, I doubled all of the ingredients except the ketchup. I only used 3 Tbsp instead of 4. I'll make it the exact same way next time, only I won't double the red pepper. It wasn't so spicy that we didn't enjoy it, but we'd prefer just a little less kick.

Followed the recipe and doubled the sauce but I thought it tasted too "ketchupy".

awesome, though i made a few changes, Instead of putting honey and water i added pineapple juice to the recipe (just about 4 Tbsp was enough, and 2 tomatos chopped up. This came out delicious. Everybody asked for more. also i didn't cook the shrimp before hand. i think that way the taste of the shrimp won't vanish. just toss it for a little bit longer before adding the sauce and then the prawns will be done with the taste still remaining. This one is a keeper

This really is better than restaurant quality! My only advice, it needs a vegetable. I added snow peas and next time maybe I'll try brocoli, but it does need something other than onions and shrimp. Great recipe!

Really good!  I made this with chicken and took others advice and added veggies ( broccoli )- I did double the sauce but I think next time I will triple it.  My husband suggested adding pineapple next time.  I can't wait to try this with Shrimp!  I served this over jasmine rice. Thank you for submitting this- it is defintely a keeper :)

AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly, but used a pound of shrimp. My family loved it - only next time they want the recipe doubled. I served it with rice, Chinese Spicey Hot & Sour Soup, and Hot & Sour Chinese Eggplant - both from this site. My 12-year-old said he felt like he was in a really nice Chinese restaurant. And it's very easy. Thanks for a great recipe.

What a great and easy way to duplicate szechwan ! Next time I will add chopped peanuts and cilantro to garnish but I really like this. I added extra garlic and pepper because of preference. Thank you! *UPDATE- made this with tofu and it turned out great. Fry the tofu first then add to sauce at very end.

Absolutely top of the line! I did not change one thing other than using fresh shrimp (all I had). So I stir cooked the fresh shrimp for just under 2 min. added the sauce and while that was bubbling and thickening the shrimp cook the rest of the way.  They were so tender! Also best to let the sauce sit for a minute or two to allow the flavours to blend. First taste, right out of the pan, they hadn't really melded yet. Ooops forgot to mention that next time I think I will use fresh ginger. To me powdered ginger is more for baking.
Another suggestion (think this has already been mentioned but..)if you use precooked shrimp, I would suggest you thicken the sauce first and then add the shrimp to heat.
This was fast, easy and super delish!
Thanks again, Foodgu1
Just wanted to say thanks again. I've now been making this for quite a few years and have not changed a thing in all this time (other than fresh shrimp & fresh ginger as noted earlier). The heat is perfect, you can taste everything exactly as you should. I serve over rice or, as in last night, rice noodles. Delish!!

Good recipe was Szechwan sauce.  I made this using Chicken.  Cut chicken breasts into pieces adn sauteed until amost done.  Degalzed my pan with some red wine.  Doubled the sauce recipes and added to chicken.  I didn't have cornstarch so I just sprinkled some flour into the the pan and it worked great.  I added some vegetable (carrots, broccoli) at the end and served over brown rice.  Turned out great and will make again.  Only giving four stars since I think you need to double the sauce.

Very good..almost like you ordered it from a restaurant. My husband and I loved it. Low fat and healthy...we added brocolli, carrots, and mushrooms. Made extra sauce too...delicious! For presentation...sprinkle sesame seeds on top!

So yummy!  I made this two weeks ago and hubby asked for it again this week! We love hot/spicy food and we love shrimp, so this was perfect.  I definitely did not skimp on the red pepper flakes.  I will double the "sauce" or even triple next time. Made with le mein noodles...yummo!

What a yummy recipe!  I did double all of the ingredients for the sauce as others had recommended except for the crushed red pepper.  Even without doubling the red pepper, it was a little hot for our taste.  We had it over rice.  Very easy to make and really very good.

This is incredible and I don't usually like seafood stir frys.  Add vegetables like matchstick carrots, chopped celery, quartered mushrooms, triple the sauce, use 3 TB tomato paste instead of ketchup and as always for us, more garlic!  Thank you for a wonderful keeper recipe.

I don't know.  Too much ketchup.  It totally tasted like ketchup shrimp.  I would make it again if I had shrimp lying around and nothing to do with them (like that ever happens, shrimp are mad expensive, yo), but I would cut the ketchup by like 1/3, cut the honey down too, and put more crushed red pep in there.

This recipe hardly needs another review but it is soooo good, I have to add my rating: 5 stars all the way.  I followed the recipe except that I used raw shrimp - started cooking them in the oil with a little butter and the garlic, adding the green onions part way through, then the sauce.  Perfect seasoning for me, as was the amount of sauce, which was not overly abundant but quite sufficient.  I'll be making this recipe again.  Very quick and easy to put together.

Made a couple of changes. 5tbs water, more garlic, chili sesame oil instead of vegetable, and fresh shrimp. Also added broccoli and red bell pepper. Tripled the sauce so I can top my rice. Otherwise, great recipe!

I was intrigued by all the good reviews for this recipe but our family really likes vegetables sooooooo  I increased the sauce fourfold and then sauteed a variety of veggies including onion, mushrooms, zucchini, carrot, asparagus then set those aside and sauteed the shrimp (I used raw shrimp) and then combined all with the sauce.  This made a huge amount but was great!!!  It is just a matter of guessing the amount of sauce but since the ingredients are cheap and available it worked really well.

Made this recipe but doubled it. Very glad I did as it would not have been enough had I followed it as is.   A reviewer questioned using ground ginger however I went ahead and used it, no problem.  Next time I will try minced gingerroot just to compare but my husband and I absolutely loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again.  I did use raw, peeled shrimp though as I do not like using cooked shrimp,  they can tend to get tough.  It's a very healthy and super tasty recipe and I am very glad I found it. It will become a well used recipe in my kitchen.

This is a great basic recipe for Szechuan shrimp. I mean for my family. We like things hot. I doubled the red pepper and ginger, quadrupled the garlic, and added a generous helping of Vindaloo curry. Also 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar. Acid brightens everything. Plus I added some lemongrass, sake, and soy sauce when I sauteed the raw shrimp (I know, not the way they outlined it, but I had raw shrimp). Unbelievable! Thank you for this great blueprint for our dinner. I did brown rice with carmelized onions, edamame, and soy sauce for an accompaniment.

I tripled the sauce ingredients  as other viewers said and used a pound of jumbo uncooked shrimp,peeled and deveined.I stayed with the same amt of red pepper flakes because I only like moderate heat. Served over brown rice vermicelli with steamed broccoli added. It was so yummy. My husband and i wolfed down our plates. There is a small lunch size left for me today..Very good and super easy. I did cook my sauce a few minutes before i added my shrimp. I wanted it to be cooked and also don't like overcooking my shrimp. ..loved this recipe and will definitely make again.

Love  szechwan 
Recipe great as is. Still I used less hot pepper flakes for hubby and tripled the ingredients to flavor the jasmine rice. Also used sweet chilli sauce instead of ketchup.   Ginger root is a staple in my jhouse. The reason all recipes is my go to for inspiration is the imput from others.

Quick, simple and tasty. Good weeknight recipe. I doubled the amount of sauce like many of the other reviewers suggested.  I also used fresh ginger instead of ground.  I mixed it all together with brown rice-glass noodles and stir fry vegetables.

If you are looking for a quick and easy shrimp recipe this is the one.  Very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.  My family loved it.  I omitted the red pepper flakes because we aren't fond of spicy foods.  I didn't have green onions on hand so I used sweet onions.  I also used cooked shrimp because that is what I had in the freezer. Oh and I doubled the sauce per other reviews.

I've made this recipe several times and I love it. I like every one else double the sauce but I don't double the ketchup cause it's a little over powering and add more soy sauce. I usually eat over rice.  This recipe is easy to make and easy to adjust to your taste depending on what you like.

Loved this easy delicious recipe for take out at home!  I did tweak by starting with a saute of lots of fresh veggies, red pepper strips, water chestnuts, mushrooms, shredded carrot and broccolini.  I used cooked shrimp and doubled the sauce, deeelish!  Hubs LOVED this over jazmine rice with spring rolls.  Fun Friday night food, thanks for sharing this recipe, FOODGU1.

I used this recipe specifically for the sauce. Rather than shrimp, I wanted to make Szechwan Chicken. Other than the meat substitution, I doubled the recipe for more sauce and doubled the red pepper flakes for our 'hot' preference. I also added fresh spinach leaves at the very end to add to our vegetable intake. With all that said, even though I made these substitutions I don't feel it really changed the overall wonderful flavor of this dish, it's all in the sauce, after all. I served over brown rice. This is a keeper with many possibilities, just maintain the integrity of the sauce. It's perfect!

Thank you FOODGU1 - This is a keeper. I made it exactly as the recipe was written (doubled) with three exceptions: I did have uncooked shrimp available so I decided to use them, and I forgot to buy the green onions at the market today. so I had to use finely chopped Vidalia onions instead. I also had fresh ginger available, so I used that as well.

I used a pound of 16/20 count shrimp (colossal size), put the onions in the pan with oil to give them a head start, and then added the shrimp. After about 3 minutes I turned the shrimp, added the ginger and garlic, let it simmer a minute or two and then started to stir the ingredients in the pan before adding the sauce.

It didn't take long for the sauce to bubble and thicken, which was perfect because the shrimp were almost done perfectly by then. 

The flavors are awesome! Not too spicy but you get that sweet tang from the ketchup and ginger, and then the garlic and red pepper kicks in.If I had the green onions, I probably would not have put them in with the shrimp - I would have held them back with the ginger and garlic and put them all in at once. The green onions would have added color and a different texture that would probably make this dish even better. 

Great recipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe. We followed it completely but used fresh shrimp. Shrimp was sauteed with the garlic and then when almost cooked through, added the sauce to finish cooking it while the sauce thickened. Please use GOOD ketchup. The cheapo Great Value ketchup will ruin this dish. If you look at other "chinese" cooking like sweet & sour sauce recipes, you will find ketchup in those recipes too, so don't let that throw you off. I have never been to the Sichuan province so I am no expert in those flavors and cannot judge the merit of the recipe name. I will try fresh ginger since I love it, but had none on hand and powdered worked just fine. I will make it again for sure!

I had cocktail shrimp on hand so I just used that and it came out just fine. Only thing I did different was that I used a table spoon of sriracha instead of ketchup and omitted the pepper flakes.

Recipe was great!  Made it last night and look forward to making it again.  I tripled the sauce and added a bag of frozen vegetables. I kept the same amount of hot pepper, thought tripling it would be too much. I used a pound of raw shrimp instead of cooked.  Great reviews from the people I made it for.

Just what I was looking for - loved it! I mixed all the sauce ingredients ahead of time so I could just quickly put it together when I got home.  Substituted ginger paste for ground ginger, and shichimi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shichimi) fir the red pepper flakes just because that's what I had on hand.

In really loved this recipe. Tripled the sauce.  I steamed fresh broccoli and carrot slices for about 5 min and put to the side. Once I put in fresh shrimp I poured in the sauce which cooks the shrimp as it bubbles. Then I added the fresh veggies and I served it over steamed rice. I also added some fresh pineapple chunks and juice for a little sweetness in with the sauce and used extra large raw shrimp that I peeled after they thawed.   Next time I will cut back on the red pepper though. A little too much heat but delicious!

10 stars!   I added craisons for a sweet zing and served over plain jasmine rice.  Highly recommend!   Many thanks for sharing.  UPDATE:  12/2016 -  I continue to make this dish as it  but I do add brocollie and hot pepper seeds at the end now.  Hope you enjoy, and thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Delicious!!  I omitted the ginger and it was still yummy!  Might go lighter on ketchup and heavier on soy next time.  Plan to add more heat to it next time as well - add some cayenne and tabasco to give it a kick. :)  We served the shrimp over white rice and it was a perfect meal.  Very easy to make and full of flavor.  Thanks!

Really nice recipe. As recommended by others, I doubled the sauce, added some fresh ginger (in addition to the ground), and added broccoli and snap peas for some green. After preparing, I added another 1-2Tbs of soy sauce (it was too "ketchupy"), and a spoonful of sugar to fine-tune the sauce.  Loved it.  But since I think the changes were very necessary, 4 stars. Yum.

This was delish, however, I made a few changes.  First, I doubled the sauce.  I also doubled the honey and added 1/2 cup of splenda brown sugar, then I added a teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper for heat. After the sauce thickened, I added steamed broccoli, it was really good, family even asked me to make it again!

Excellent recipe! My hubby and I had this for supper and we made 4x the sauce. I only added half of the hot pepper flakes and it was pretty spicy at that. Very good flavor. It was also good with veggies like red onion, mushrooms, celery, carrots, etc. Just quickly stir fry them first, set them aside and add at the end to coat with sauce.

Quite good.  The ketchup taste was a little more than I would like but tasty none the less.  Wish I could have added all the chili peppers suggested but I wanted my 3 year old to be able to eat it.

Amazing!  My family loved it. I mixed up the sauce and cooked some rice before church.  Then I fried the rice and cooked the sauce when we got home.  Very quick!

This was FABULOUS! I used raw shrimp and sautéed them with the green onions and garlic for a couple minutes before adding the sauce. This was so simple and delicious- also reheats perfectly the following day for lunch. I will make this again (and again!)

Hands down, this is a 5 star meal!!! You have the freedom of whipping it up with any & all of your favorite vegetables to custom design a meal that the whole family will enjoy.  I added thinly sliced carrots, snow peas, mushrooms & broccoli and used about a pound of shrimp instead of the 12 oz pkg.  I had so many veggies, that I quadrupled the sauce, and it was just perfect.  My parents and I LOVED it.  My mom even asked me to pack up a bit of the leftovers for her so she could take some to work the next day and make her coworkers jealous! My husband doesn't like shrimp, so for him, I reserved some of the veggies and the sauce beforehand, and in a separate skillet, browned some cut up chicken with the onions, garlic & oil, then threw in the veggies & sauce.  It thickened up in less than 30 seconds since it was a smaller portion.  He also gave it a 5 star review!  They all thought the spiciness was just perfect! It was just enough to get you to the point where your nose starts running a little bit, but not enough to make your tongue burn so much that you can't even enjoy the actual flavor of the food. And for those of us who like spicy food, (not flaming-my-tongue-is-swollen-&-can't-taste-anything spiciness) we all know that the "sweet spot" in spiciness is where your nose starts running but your tongue is still in tact. ;)  I tasted it with the chicken too and I loved it.  Can't wait to try it again with pork, and maybe even beef.  This recipe will definitely be gobbled up!

The screams of delight from my 2 and 3 year old when I asked "should i make this recipe for your birthday?" said it all. This one is a keeper for special occasions. I used fresh ginger. Every bite was festive and tangy!

We loved this but mine was a bit too spicy, probably because I steamed the shrimp with some Old Bay and just gave them a quick stir at the end. I would just add raw shrimp at the end next time and serve on rice which would cut the spice some. I definitely would make again, as another review said" fast , easy, healthy" what's not to love.

This recipe is super easy to make and very tasty! I did add some chinese brocolli while stir-frying and served it with white rice. It was so good I didn't even eat it with the rice! My family loved it too. Although it was spicy, my teenagers could handle it.

We tried this last night, doubled the sauce recipe as suggested by a few readers.  Other than being too spicy for my teen, it was great!  Flavour was fantastic, if u have someone sensitive to heat drop the crushed pepped by half, and the ginger by half :) :)

Awesomely spicy! I doubled the sauce. Could not imagine not doing that. I added sugar pea pods, shaved carrots and the green onion to have our veggies all in one pot. I don't think I put enough shrimp in (just dumped some in). It only served two with some left over rice. Will definitely make again. Would also be good with chicken or beef.

Made this last night.  I did double the sauce and I'm glad that I did. The flavor is okay a little too spicy for me and I only used 1/4 tsp of red pepper. As someone else suggested, I put in some broccoli.  It is just okay.  Don't think I would make again.  There are better recipes in which to use shrimp.

Awesome! I've been intimidated by Chinese cuisine, but thought I would give this a try. It was quick, easy, and totally satisfying. We added broccoli with the onions and garlic. It was wonderful. You do need to increase the liquid if you add vegetables.we also used fresh ginger and it added a nice flavor.

I tripled the sauce as others suggested because I made rice & topped with a bag of microwaved frozen stir fry veggies then the shrimp with sauce.  The recipe was easy, spicy and delicious.  You can add broccoli & carrots, or snow peas or scallops as you wish and it would be delicious wih any of those.  My hubby loved it and we will be making it again.

Restaurant quality and one of the easiest and quickest meals I've ever made from this site. I served on top of jasmine rice and with an Asian vegetable medley. I agree with two reviewers who suggested doubling the sauce and also using raw shrimp. I am going to try this with chicken and tofu as well.

Yummy!!  I added fresh bell peppers and onions and doubled the sauce (everything but the vegetable oil) an it was amazing!  I did put much less red pepper flakes just for personal preference.  Will be making again!  My husband couldn't believe I made the sauce from scratch!!

These shrimp are very good.  I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods so I was worried this recipe would be too hot, but I thought the amount of heat was perfect and well balanced with the honey.  Served over brown rice for a nice, healthy meal.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought this dish packed a lot of flavor into a small amount of calories.  The only change I think I will make for next time is substituting fresh ginger for the ground.  I hardly noticed the taste of the ginger in this, and think the fresh ginger would add another layer of flavor.

We all enjoyed it. I am giving this 5 stars as I cannot rate it objectionably since I was missing a key ingredient, the ginger. To rate it lower would be unfair since I did not prepare as written (I don't think ANY reviewer should rate a recipe after altering and then judging it on the outcome of their own alteration(s). It is NO longer the submitters recipe, but the reviewers.) Even so, this was a very good recipe, however a touch too hot for our liking. I needed more servings, so doubled the shrimp and thus tripled the sauce. I did cut way back, as is on the red pepper and still had plenty of heat. Also, added shrimp few minutes before serving so they would not get tough. Just needed to heat them since already cooked. Can't wait to try with the addition of the ginger!

Meh. It was good, but nothing to queue the fireworks or dramatic music. Not sure if I'll be making this again. I made it exactly as written, but doubled the sauce (a must), used raw shrimp since I don't like the precooked and fresh ginger since it's a million times better. I served over angel hair.

Excellent and Easy!  I have made this twice, once with shrimp and the second time with chicken.  For the chicken I doubled the sauce, but with 3 tsp. cornstarch, and added a broccoli florets.  I also added minced fresh ginger because we like extra spicy and a little water to make it just a little lighter sauce.  This recipe rivals Chinese restaurants.

MMMM MMMM this one is yummy. We were also serving this to our toddler so I left out the red pepper flakes and it still had a very nice sweet & sour vibe. I used raw shrimp,  a maple and agave syrup blend in place of the honey and threw in some sugar snaps when the shrimp were half done which added a really nice crunch, we served it over brown rice. I love how this can be made with pretty much condiments from the door of the fridge, you could make this every week and only have to buy a bag of shrimp.

We like this allot.  It has allot of flavor without being killer-hot.   Don't change a thing, the recipe is great as-written.  I made the sauce early in the day, and it was a snap to get dinner on the table with a salad & strir-fried Asian veggies.  This one goes in the book for sure!

Very good. Cut the red pepper flakes in half - so our 5 year old would eat it, and she did and it still had a little heat.

Wow - that was a total hit!  I made this as stated except I doubled the sauce (a must do) and added a bit of cayenne (like 1/4 tsp) to spice it up a bit and used fresh ginger (ps - you can freeze ginger roots for a long time).  I used raw shrimp.  I cooked the raw shrimp in the garlic/onion/oil mix till just turning pink, then tossed the sauce in along with a bag of fresh stir-fry veggies and cooked for a few mins till the veggies were crunchy but not-quite-cooked.  Then I added some rice noodles in the last 3 minutes and covered to let them cook (they cook really quickly).  Tossed it all up and served.  It was DELISH and there's no more between 2 of us!  Will be making this again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

I have rarely found anything that calls for "ketchup" to be of high quality,  

The only "Szechwan" thing about this was the addition of peppercorns, but as for the flavor, it's far from it. In fact, this tasted more like a tropical shrimp dish, with ginger... go figure.

Delicious!  Went a little overboard with the crushed red pepper (we like spicy!), but the flavor was so good that my husband went back for seconds and keeps talking about the "gourmet meal" we had for dinner!  This is a very versatile recipe and can be customized with any meats/tofu/veggies you have on hand.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  Had some cooked shrimp I need to use up so I used them.  However, when I make this again I will use raw shrimp and cook them up in the sauce.  Just the right amount of spice as kids loved it too.  I used fresh ginger and very glad I did...yum.

Not so sure we liked this with shrimp but the flavoring was still incredible. My DH soaked up the remaining sauce with some bread. Will definitly make again but maybe with chicken, beef or pork.

Delicious, easy, healthy!  I'm a fan.  Thank you for the recipe.  We made baby bok choy along with it, and it was awesome.  Next time I'll try using real ginger, but it was fine with the ground.

This is one of my all time favorite dishes - it's quick and easy but very flavorful and heats up well for leftovers the next day. We always make a double batch of the sauce to really coat the steamed rice!

I was surprised how much I liked this! It was a super quick dinner with rice and bok choy on the side. I thought my boyfriend would complain that it tasted like ketchup (he can ALWAYS taste when an Asian recipe uses ketchup), but he just remarked on how good it was. I will definitely make this again. I used raw shrimp as that's what I had on hand and just spent as extra couple minutes cooking them.

I agree with another reviewer, if you can it's definitely worth it to add some fresh ginger.  I also like my food with some more kick, so I double the red pepper when I make this.

Made this exactly per the directions. I found it too salty, I will try a low salt soy sauce next time. Also, for some the crushed red pepper may be a bit much. I personally liked the "heat" (it is Szechwan, after all), but next time lessen the red pepper in the recipe and then let others add more to their taste(s).

This is so good. I have been looking for a great szechuan recipe and I have finally found it. I like to make extra sauce and add cooked linguine noodles to the shrimp to make it similar to a noodle bowl. I prefer to use uncooked shrimp because if you use cooked shrimp the texture can get too tough, but that is just a preference.

I doubled the sauce as per other reviewers and we were happy with the finished product.  I added minced fresh ginger to the garlic and green onions, and sauteed raw shrimp with that mixture before adding the sauce - I think that made a big difference, it had a very nice taste of shrimp.  It was delicious but a bit too thick for our liking, next time I will add less corn starch.

The most amazing and delicious quick recipe! Great as is. I used large thawed EZ peel shrimp because it's what I had (they cook quickly), and also threw in about one tablespoon sesame seeds, just because I love them so much! I will make this again and again! Thanks!

I'd give this 5 stars for flavour.  It's not spicy at all though, I'd call it sweet.  Almost has a bit of a teriyaki taste.

This was so stinkin easy and tasty I cant believe it! Next time I will use raw and larger shrimp so it gets more flavor, but for speed, cooked is awesome. did with the tomato salad and rice in less than 30m with the only prep being the thawing of the shrimp. I also threw in some peanuts and match stick carrots to go further.

FANTASTIC!!  This recipe is as quick and easy as it is delicious!  I made no changes except to double the sauce and add stir fry vegetables then served over rice.  This is a new favorite in our home!

This was absolutely delicious; better than take-out! I followed the recipe as posted, and although it WAS a bit spicy, my husband and I loved it that way! We had it over boiled white rice. Very simple & filling dish; will definitely make this again!

My family enjoyed this dish, although I must agree that the ketchup was a little overpowering. I will reduce the amount for the next time. I tripled the sauce, as suggested, since I added veggies. I also used raw shrimp instead. 

Low fat, great flavor! What more can you ask? I will definitely make again. 
Thanks FOODGU1.

I followed the recommendation of the cooks here and doubled the sauce. Unfortunately, it still wasnt enough. I think it was due to me adding all the veggies. I used a little bit less ketchup since some people here stated there was a ketchup taste. I added additional hot chilli paste, used both ground and fresh ginger, a tad more soy sauce and a little less cornstarch. For the veggies I added broccoli, mushrooms, red bell peppers and bamboo. (See the picture I uploaded). I served it over steamed white rice.

Overall, it was very tasty. My boyfriend (a picky eater) really enjoyed it. He even went for a 3rd helping! Will be making again soon.. this time I'll try it with chicken

I followed the advice of other members and doubled the sauce recipe.  I also used chow mein noodles instead of rice.  This recipe was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  There was a bit of a kick to it because of the red pepper flakes but it wasn't too spicy for us.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars was because I felt it could have used some vegetables.

Good but I would cook the shrimp instead of using the precooked shrimp. Definitely double or triple the sauce. And add rice and veggies...the meal is too plain without veggies.

We had this with thinly sliced pork that I marrinated in the sauce for a few hours.  Then made more sauce for with the veggies (mushrooms, snow peas, carrots, green beans, bok choy).  Excellent!  I used a touch more red pepper flakes (perhaps 1/8 teaspoon) and omitted oil from the second batch of sauce.  Will definitely have again!

Very good.  We had this with a cucumber salad recently.  At first I didn't think there was going to be enough souce and contemplated doubling the sauce.  I'm glad I didn't, there was enough sauce to coat the shrimp and the yakisoba noodles I served this over.  I used two pinches of red pepper flakes, probably could have used more.  Great tasting shrimp dish.

Yummy! Tastes like it came from the Chinese restaurant down the street, but less salty and without that sitting-under-the-warming-lights flavor. Personally, I could handle a tad more red pepper & honey, I love the spicy-sweet contrast!

This was a  great dish. I was making for 2 and the first time halved the sauce, but it was too little to the next time I kept it as is. I also added broccoli and baby corn. It nice with noodles or rice. Thanks for sharing the recipe

It was good, but nothing amazing.  It was also too spicy, especially for my husband's taste (and I had decreased the amount of red pepper flake!).  I would eat it again, but it won't be on our "frequent rotation" list!

Busy Parent Alert:  This recipe is perfect for those days when you need a fast dinner to feed fussy kids. The flavor is fantastic and the recipe is super easy. My kid likes spicy food so he didn't mind the flavor and kick of the teaspoon of sriracha (hot chili sauce) that I used instead of red pepper flakes. The hardest part of this recipe was collecting the jars and bottles from the fridge and pantry!  I used half a bag of frozen cooked shrimp (tail on - it took a few minutes to remove these). I keep jars of ginger and minced garlic in the fridge, perfect for this recipe.  I added a bit more ginger and soy sauce and less green onion, to taste.  I also quartered lengthwise some leftover baby carrots and added some fresh sugar snap peas (they sell those steamer bags of fresh veggies in the produce section - perfect for this kind of recipe). I dragged out the rice cooker and actually made perfect rice for once - a delicious partner for this dish!  Next time, I will double the sauce (my son wanted extra) and otherwise won't change a thing.  This was a 20-30 minute meal (counting rice cooking time) that can't be beat!

Honey, ketchup?! My partner was taken aback at the ingredients listed in this recipe. But don't be fooled, the end result is the perfect amount of spicy, and pretty good flavors overall.  I really like how accessible this Asian recipe is compared to others which require me to spend money on ingredients that won't get used very often in my kitchen (ex: oyster sauce).I confess I did not follow the recipe to the letter. Changes as follows: Used all the ingredients but replaced shrimp with thin slices of chicken. Fresh grated ginger instead of ground, red pepper flakes, added steamed broccoli/carrots and as others recommended doubled the sauce. Overall I am pleased with the results and will probably use this recipe again. Thanks!

Sauce itself is outstanding - my only substitute was to use chile sauce in leu of red peppers.  Not sure if using pre-cooked shrimp works ... either that or my shrimp were just old.  Not a great compliment to the wonderful sauce.  Will try again using this sauce with chicken and/or raw shrimp.

I wanted to try this recipe, although we hadn't eaten Szechwan shrimp before. The recipe itself was good and easy, but I guess the taste was not to our liking.

Taste was pretty good...Wonderful spicy kick! I used fresh ginger but still felt like this was missing something...some depth of flavor. I made the Asian coconut rice from this site and it went really well together - spicy shrimp with sweet, rich coconut rice. Mmmm!

My 4 stars is really for the sauce. It's very tasty! My only recipe suggestion (besides doubling the sauce) is to use uncooked shrimp. Cooking the already cooked shrimp while the sauce thickens makes the shrimp needlessly tough.

Before cooking it the sauce smelled and tasted funny, we were skeptical. But after cooking it with the veggies and shrimp, it was AMAZING!!

Also, we added mushrooms, broccoli, and green pepper to have more veggies.

Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil

this was good, but I doubled the sauce (you have to or else it would be too dry to eat it with white rice) and threw in some veggies to add more color. would make again...

This is a very spicy (but tasty) dish; I suggest waiting until the very end before adding the red pepper, even if you've doubled or tripled the sauce. That way, you can add it little by little to suit your taste. Also, plan on at least doubling the sauce (if not tripling) if you serve over rice. Next time I think I'll try adding in some stir-fry veggies like broccoli and peppers!

Really very good.  I used olive oil instead of veg oil.  The sauce thickened very quickly.  It had just the right amount of kick. Very easy and quick prep. Will definitely make again.

This turned out really good but as written I do not feel there is enough sauce. In order to cover 12 oz. of shrimp it needs doubled at least or tripled if you like it saucy like we do. Other than that, I have no complaints. The flavors blend nicely and you can adjust the heat according to your personal taste.

Used 1 lb. of shrimp, added fresh broccoli/carrots, frozen peas and cashews.  Used fresh ginger instead of ground.  Tripled the sauce and it was the perfect amount.  Heat level was just right .. my 8-yr-old son ate it up w/ no complaints.  Will make again!

AWESOME!  I actually grilled the shrimp, dipped them into the sauce afterwards, and put them over salad and it was just delicious!  I can't wait to make it again -- would definitely make a great appetizer.  Thank you!

It's not as spicy as others say it is. I actually added  in some habanero peppers to make it spicier:). I'd recommend not trying to cook this in a pan - follow directions and make in a skillet or else the sauce will cook down too quickly and you'd be left with nothing but a glaze. I'd also recommend not adding habanero peppers unless you're like me and like spicy foods, or you're trying to get over a cold! Lastly, I agree with those who advise doubling up on the ingredients for the sauce. The shrimp really absorb it so you're going to need more than the recipe calls for. Enjoy - it's really a great dish!

Absolutely delicious.  It's not too spicy, just the perfect amount.  We were going to order Chinese food but I wanted to try this instead... it was ready before the delivery man would have gotten here!

It was awesome with white rice.  I tripled the sauce because I added some stir fry veggies ( as other reviewers suggested) and it was perfect, although I have to say I am not generally a fan of soggy frozen veggies but I needed something quick.

Keep the sauce recipe as is!  Next time I may add some FRESH cooked veggies, but frozen works fine in a pinch too.

Loved the simplicity of this recipe as well as the taste.  Great for quick weeknight supper or for company.  Like others, I doubled the sauce ingredients (but only increased the red pepper slightly).  My husband loved it and he is not a big shrimp person so that said a lot.  My girls don't eat shrimp, but if they did, I would have to reduce the pepper in this.  Will definitely make again.  May also try with chicken.

Wow!  What can I say.  The reviews were so convincing that I decided to make this at a dinner party without even trying it myself.  It looked easy and delicious.  Everyone said it was easy and delicious.  And it was.  I tripled the sauce and doubled the shrimp.  I had plenty for 6 adults with a little left over for me to have for lunch the next day.

Very tasty dish! I love spicy foods, but I found this a little hot. To reduce the tears running down my cheeks, next time I will opt for either a little more honey or a little less pepper flakes. Either way, the taste was perfect and it was simple to make! Thanks for this recipe!

I made the sauce first, doubled it with the garlic and let it boil to reduce by half.  Then added defrosted, frozen cooked shrimp, rinsed in lemon water and dried well, steamed broccoli instead of green onions, served over brown rice.  Pefect!

We loved it! I made a plain batch for the kids with barely any red pepper in it, but for us I sliced up two jalapenos, with their seeds and added it to the garlic and green onions. (We like it hot! ) I also added more red pepper to our sauce. For the veggies, I steamed one head of broccoli, four asparagus and a handful of green beans. I julienned some carrots and cooked those with the garlic too. I doubled everything in the sauce for both batches except for the ketchup. It really was delicious and would even be great with thinly sliced chicken breast instead of shrimp. This definitely tastes like a restaurant and was fabulous! Thanks!

This was sooo good!  I doubled the ingredients for the sauce as other suggested, but realized after I should have since I was only cooking for myself.  I made about 2 servings to have left overs and there was plenty of sauce, but it tastes so good so I don't mind!  I didn't use green onions because I didn't have any, but I"m sure it would add some flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe & easy to alter too. I tripled the sauce like other reviewers suggested, doubled the onions & garlic and used a whole pound of medium-sized shrimp. Also, I did NOT increase the chili flakes and it was still nice and spicy (just not HOT). Added red bell pepper, baby carrots & broccoli florets and served it all over rice. Yummy!

Really tasty. Truly lovely to be served on a bed of white rice and some greens. Next time I will make a little more sauce and will season with a pinch of salt too. Depending on your spice tolerance upping or decreasing the red pepper is recommended. Personally I thought it could do with a tad bit more spice! :)

Amazing, best shrimp recipe on the planet. Very easy and quick, and who doesn't usually have all these ingredients on hand? I doubled the sauce and served over white rice, wanted to add some veg but never did, will try some stir fry veggies mixed in next time. Will make again and again and again! Would be good with chicken too for my non-seafood eating hubby!

Extremely easy and fast to make. Added green and yellow peppers and steamed broccoli, served over white rice. Great spicy flavor. Definitely use raw shrimp, it only needs to cook for 5 minutes or so.

This was a fab recipe. Not my #1 favorite shrimp recipe but really darn good. I didnt have green onions so I used white and I doubled the sauce to put over brown rice. I also served cauliflower on the side. Our meal is not compete without a side of veggies. The whole family really enjoyed this and it is so easy and simple to make. My kids (5 & 2) enjoyed this also even with the spice to it, though they do like spicy foods.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I tripled the sauce because I added some veggies- thin carrot slices, snap peas and bell pepper. I only gave it four stars because it wasn't as hot as I was expecting it to be after reading other reviews. I think next time I will add a little more spice and then it will be perfect. Thanks for such a quick and easy delicious recipe!

i must have done something wrong, because i really didn't like this at all! the flavour of the ginger AND the red pepper flakes was waaaaaay too strong - the sauce tasted like a hot salt lick. i had to add sugar to balance out the flavours and make it even remotely palatable, which i really didn't want to have to do. but like i said, maybe i did something wrong. i give it 2 stars, because it was a good base, but needed lots of work to suit my tastes.

This is my new favorite recipe. I always add some kind of veggie. Carrots, pea pods, peas, sugar snap peas ect...I too double the sauce recipe.  I recommend adding the shrimp raw. They only take 2 minutes and they add so much flavor to the sauce.

NICE!  I doubled the sauce and let the shrimp marinade in it for 20 or so minutes.  I then put the shrimp with the sauce in the pan with onion and garlic...did use more garlic then called for. I did NOT double the corn starch I did 3 tsp and the sauce was the perfect consistency. I also used 1.3 pounds shrimp.  I served this with fried rice and there was plenty of sauce.  I will make this again!

Great!  I was concerned because it smelled "ketchupy" while cooking, but the flavor was great.  I used a ton of red pepper because I like it hot.    I doubled the recipe, and even then I consider that to be 1-2 servings, so plan accordingly.

Excellent, simple, easy ingredients, great quick dinner but flavorful enough for company. I agree with other reviews that say to double the sauce if you are going to add additional veggies. The sauce rocks!
Update: I probably make this once a week for a quick meal, sometimes I stir fry veggies, or use frozen fried rice. Taste restaurant quality.

This recipe has some kick. I have a pretty high tolerance for hot spice so I loved it. If you don't have a high tolerance, be careful with the amount of red pepper you add. I added veggies to the recipe. It was crazy easy and very good. I will make this again!

I usually don’t like shrimp but this recipe was the best! I did not follow that advice from the others and did not cut back the red peppers, my kids could not eat it and my husband and I were breathing fire! Next time I will for sure cut back on how much I put in.

Perfect! Definitely double the sauce, I used 1 pound fresh shrimp, and used the House Fried Rice recipe from this site. Definitely a winner at our house! Can't wait for the leftovers. Next time I will try adding some Louis Kemp crabmeat.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I used fresh shrimp so it took a few extra minutes in the pan. Next time I will add 1 tsp. of red pepper per our preference. Now my real twist was to throw in a drained can of stirfry vegtables to make a szechwan shrimp stir fry to feed 4. I ate mine over crispy rice noodles and my hubby ate his over rice, yummy! Thanks for the easy meal recipe.

I added vegetables and Sriracha sauce.  I also used fresh shrimp.  The recipe turned out well, but I thought that the sauce was a little bit plain.

We did not like this at all.  Maybe I did something wrong?!  I actually made the sauce and set some aside prior to adding the red pepper so my 4 year old would be ok, there was no need to do this - the part with the spice was not spicy (for us) even.  I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce, maybe I should not have, maybe that it where I went wrong.

As written, I cannot say how this recipe would be. But deriving from my own experience and from the combined comments, what I came up with, using this recipe as a guideline, was definitely 5-star worthy, and very very close to what I've had when I have ordered this dish in restaurants - possibly better.   The final recipe, as I made it, is as follows:    4 tbsp ketchup  6 tbsp water  2 tbsp Sake (Rice Wine)  2 tbsp soy sauce  2 tbsp corn starch  2 tbsp honey  1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes  1 tsp fresh ginger (finely grated)  1/3 cup green onions  6 cloves garlic  1 lb shrimp deveined  1 tbsp sesame seeds (to finish)    Served it over rice, came out freakin' awesome. I cook a lot of Oriental flavors, Kung Pao and General Tso among them, and thanks to this recipe (albeit altered) I've now got yet another great and flavorful dish to add to my repertoire. Truly worthy of 5 stars, the way I had it.

This is very different and good! I added fresh, chopped veggies to pan 5-10 minutes before serving. I will definitely be making this again and I'm also going to try using chicken instead of shrimp.

I made this today for lunch for some friends.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of fresh shrimp and tripled the sauce.  I only used 1/2 of the red pepper flakes and it had a nice heat....can't imagine it with the full amount - makes me wanna drink a pitcher of margaritas just thinking about it...is that a bad thing??  I used olive oil in lieu of the veg. oil. Served over sticky rice.  This was wowzer.  My friends seemed to enjoy it.   Served it with roquefort pear salad, from AR also, which is always a winner and some nice soft rolls.  A successful feeding event!

I thought this was great!  Very spicy!  I tripled the recipe as recommended by others, for 2 lbs of uncooked shrimp and 4 cups veggies.  For the cornstarch mixture I added some chili garlic sauce, fresh grated ginger, and sesame oil to deepen the flavor.  I didn't have any green onions so I added a regular sweet onion to the oil to saute, added 12 cloves minced garlic to the oil (only 1 tbsp oil, not 3), then added the veggies.  It was too dry so I added a cup of chicken stock and the shrimp too.  Once it steamed a little bit I added the sauce and let it cook more.  Served over rice and it was really yummy!  Tomorrow I'll steam another couple of cups of broccoli because there's so much sauce left over (less shrimps).

This is a really great recipe, however beware the amount of crushed red pepper you use...I used the whole 1/2 tsp and it was so spicy my husband couldn't eat it. I love spicy though so I loved it, so next time I'll only use a tiny bit, pull out half of the shrimp for him and then add more to my half.  I always use Mochiko (sweet rice flour found in the Asian section of any good grocery store) in place of cornstarch in Asian recipes as it thickens wonderfully without leaving a chalky taste or weird consistency.  This is an easy, delicious, and healthy dish, you should try it!

This was quite good. I doubled the sauce but kept the red pepper to 1/2 tsp like  others and added chopped fresh orange bell pepper. I found the sauce to be a little too sweet but that was easily overcome by adding a bit more pepper. Overall this dish was a great success!

With some of the tweaking suggested by others, this can become a 5 star recipe.  I used raw rather than cooked shrimp and doubled the amount of sauce, adding an extra tablespoon of soy sauce and leaving out 1 teaspoon of cornstarch.  I also replaced the ground ginger with a teaspoon of minced fresh ginger, and added a box of frozen broccoli.  It was so good - there were no leftovers!

We loved this recipe! However I will make more sauce the next time.  The heat was perfect for us.  I used half shrimp and half cod and added some brocoli as others suggested. Big hit at our house.  I will try this on one company in the future.

A very good dish.  I made some small changes, I think for the better.  I used fresh ginger rather than powder.  I also toasted a tablespoon of sesame seeds in the wok before I added the onion and garlic.  Other than those changes I made the recipe as it said.  Turned out great.  Will be making that one again.

I made this and everyone loved it. Even my picky 4 year old that is always skeptical about shrimp even though she's always loved it when I made it. I served this with corn and mandarin oranges as sides. We definitely needed more though it fed the three of us with only enough left for one person to have seconds, so no one wanted it and we ended up being hungry again an hour later.

This needs just one more flavor to be perfect, but my palate is not refined enough to identify it. But when I consider the effort required, I have to give it 5 stars.  We keep cooked shrimp in the freezer, so this was done no time.  I rinsed the shrimp, but didn't thaw them before adding them to the sauce to avoid getting them too tough. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I also added about 1.5 cups of red and green peppers with onions from the freezer. Hubby and I loved this!

This was okay. Wasn't hot enough for my tastes. Added sweet chili pepper sauce which heated it up nicely.
I bought a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, which if I had remembered to add them (duh!) would have really added to this recipes. 
My husband raved, wants it again. But I'll have to play around with it before I'm sold.

I was skeptical at first because the ingredient list seemed so simple - I had most of this stuff in my pantry already for crying out loud!  But, this tastes like it came from an upscale Asian restaurant, and it only takes about 30 minutes to make!  Only changes:  I doubled all ingredients except for the shrimp to make extra sauce (as others suggested), used flour instead of cornstarch for thickening (its what I had in the pantry) and added a half bag of frozen stir fry veggies.  Served over rice and had a complete meal in 30 minutes.  CANT BEAT THAT!

I followed previous suggestions and made a few changes... but only additions and increasing the servings:

1) Tripled the sauce recipe (Not only because I added Asian stir-fry veggies but because I always have a couple of my teens friends over for dinner and needed for than 4 servings)
2) Added a bag of frozen Asian stir-fry veggies (with water chestnuts, yum). Microwaved them separately, draining completely, and set aside.
3) I used frozen, pre-cooked shrimp, which I defrosted with cool-temp water in a bowl in the sink for about 10 minutess.
4) While shrimp, sauce and veggies were heating up in the wok, I microwaved 5-minute instant rice (6 servings)
5) When rice was done, mixed everything together (to make sure there was an even disbursement of rice, veggies and sauce.. otherwise, I'd have more or less of one or the other) and it was great

Of course, everyone commented on the spice, even though I warned them that Szechwan is meant to be spicy and this recipe was not even as spicy as in the restaurant. You can always reduce the heat by reducing the red peppers. 

They all loved the meal, though, despite the heat. My husband got the sweats (he's a big ol' baby.. but still cleaned his bowl out.

The teens all ate it. Loved it. My daughter, the anorexic (I say teasingly because she eats so little) demanded to know why I have to make such good food.. "To make you eat," I remarked back.

It was too hot for our two year old but he was happy with cheese hot dogs.

I tripled the recipe and turned this into a stir fry.  While I was mixing the sauce, I used raw shrimp and sauted them with garlic in a little olive oil.  Once they were almost done I added the sauce and let it simmer to thicken a bit.  While it was thickening, I microwaved two bags of "steam in bag" stirfry veggies.  When they were done I added them to the skillet and heated through.  I served over rice.  Super easy, super tasty, and a wonderful presentation.  Looked like something right out of a chinese restaurant.

I made this tonight and it was pretty good.  I made it exactly as is and was pleased with the balance of flavors, it had a little bit of heat and a little bit of sweetness and very garlic-y!  I added sugar snap peas and carrots and served over brown rice and me and the hubby ate every bit!  I will most likely make this again.

This was simple to make, however calling it "Szechwan" is a bit misleading.  It's more like a sweet and sour.  Also, I had to double the recipe to have enough sauce for four servings.  It isn't a bad recipe, but likely one that I will not make again.

LOVE IT! My only complaint is that there wasn't even close to enough of this sauce. ( I guess I like my rice covered with sauce) My only substitute was fresh ginger instead of ground ginger to really punched up the flavour.

This dish was quite tasty.  I would recommend this dish again and again.  It was easy to prepare and literally took a total of 20 Minutes.  I used steamed fresh shrimp first and then followed the recipe exactly.  Very good.  Thanks for submitting.

I tried this last night.  The family ate it but the sauce wasn't so great to me.  I did follow the recipe exactly as written but don't think I got great results.  I was ok I think I might make the sauce a day ahead of time next time I try this.

Excellent flavor with such simple ingredients--fast and easy--will make over and over with shrimp, chicken, pork, you name it!  Add some veggies and rice for a complete meal -- Definitely a sauce to keep on hand.

Love this! I was making this for my boyfriend and I thought maybe I would try chicken. I asked him which he preferred and of course he said "how about both!" So i cut up 2 chicken breast into chunks and cooked them on the stove top. Then used half them amount of shrimp that the recipe calls for. It turned out fabulous. Thanks.

Added some cilantro for a fresh twist. Also added some 5 spice powder 1/2 teasp or so - along with the ginger. Next time I'll use fresh shrimp and fresh ginger.

Very good, will make again.

This was amazing cooked with some edimame and sesame seeds...  I also served it over green "bamboo" rice, which made a great contrast.   I should have definitely doubled the sauce and added some more soy sauce.   Very, very tasty and so simple!

I loved this! I used the sauce on a stir fry of cabbage, sweet peas, broccoli, swiss chard, carrots, and pepper.  It was great, and just the right amount of spicy.  As others noted, it was one-dimensional, and I think adding a bit of acid (rice vinegar or lime juice) will take care of that. I'm going to try that tonight, and report back.

Excellent!  This is worthy of a repeat performance for sure. I didn't find it overly spicy at all.  Next time, I'll double or triple the sauce as the recipe doesn't make much.  Thanks for posting!

Allright, I'll admit it.  I was one of those non-believers who didn't see how chinese food made with ketchup could possibly be good.  But WOW!  Not only was this an excellent dish, it took about 20 minutes to get on the table.  The only change I made was to add chunks of red bell pepper.  Yummy!

This is really delicious.  I went much heavier on the crushed red pepper for more heat.  In addition, if you plan to use more veggies than just green onion, do triple the amount of the sauce ingredients.  In peanut oil and the garlic (double the amount) I cooked the onions, thin sliced red bell pepper, cubed zucchini for about 4 minutes so they were still crunchy.  Then removed from the wok.  I added a bit more peanut oil and threw in about a pound of uncooked shrimp.  When that was part way cooked, I pushed the shrimp up the sides and added the sauce in and stirred the shrimp back in.  Then I added the veggies back in when the shrimp was just about done to coat everything in the sauce.  Just delicious.  Served over sticky rice.

This recipe got rave reviews at home :)  However I did make a few alterations.

Alterations:

I doubled the sauce...ie...
8 tablespoons of water.
2 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce
1 tablespoon of ketchup
2 tablespoons of soy sauce
2 teaspoons of honey
I used 3 slices of fresh ginger root as well as the ground.
6-8 cloves of garlic
1/4 cup of white wine.
I kept the spice to same due to having a small child and just adjusted on my own plate.
I omitted the cornstarch, I found no need for it.  The sauce thickened lovely on it's own.

I used beef instead of shrimp.

All in all excellent recipe :)

Bravo - a must make asian dish at home!  I over-did the red pepper and it was a tad too spicey for me - but my husband loved it.  I used frozen pre-cook/cleaned shrimp and dinner was made in minutes.  Longest time was the 20 minutes that the rice took.  Enjoy this one with family and friends...

I read the reviews, tripled the sauce, added the veggies, etc... and as this was cooking I realized I was making a Green Giant Create-A-Meal.  Seriously, if you've ever had the Szechwan Create-A-Meal, this is the same thing except with more work and actually less flavor.  They even include peanuts and awesome veggies in the package- all you add is the meat.  Soooo, while this was pretty good (but didn't have nearly the flavor I thought it would) next time I will stick with my quick, easy, and tasty Green Giant Create-A-Meal.

Followed others recommendations and doubled the liquid ingredients and added frozen stir fry vegetables. Very bland. The only thing I tasted was the mild spice from the red peppers

I was so excited about this recipe and unfortuntely it did not live up to the hype.  It wasn't bad, but it certainly was not great.  Definitely missing something and if I figure out what that is, then I MIGHT make this again.  But probably not.  It was just kind of ketchup-y and spicy but didn't actually have a ton of flavor.  So again, it wasn't BAD - but my boyfriend didn't have seconds.  And that is really saying something.  Thanks for the easy-ingredients-already-in-the-cupboard recipe, but there are too many amazing recipes out there that take just as little time as this one does to make any more dinners that consist primarily of ketchup and water.

This was soooo good.NEVER use pre-cooked shrimp because it won't soak up any of the flavor so I used raw and added frozen broccoli.Definately double or triple sauce.I have a two year old who eats everything, and this was too spicy for her so I would say if making this for children don't add quite as much of the pepper but for adults who like spicy, it's perfect.

This was fantastic.  I did add extra water like others mentioned & cut down on the red pepper.  I also used fresh, raw shrimp & I don't think I'll ever order Schezuan out again.  This is a keeper.

I made this with chicken and loved it.  I added some red peppers, carrots, onion and water chestnuts and quadrupled the sauce (because of all of the added veggies).  It is nice and spicy which I loved and I simply served it over some white rice.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent!!!  I used a little over 1/2 pound of fresh shrimp since that's what I had... doubled the sauce... doubled the crushed red pepper (cuz I like it **spicy**)... added water chestnuts, bean sprouts, green pepper and onion (cuz I like my veggies)... and boy oh boy was this fantastic.  Thanks so much for posting. I'll definitely make this again (and again... and again!!)

Loved this! I would add more water because sauce thickened up too quickly and I like letting the sauce boil for a couple of minutes before serving.  I doubled the sauce and used 1 lb shrimp.  I would like a little more spicyness so next time I'll try more crushed red pepper.

This arrived in my inbox as the "Daily Dish" for 2/7/08.  I was so excited to try it I made it that night.  I tripled the sauce portion of the recipe (with no variations) and used it with 1.5 lbs. of sliced chicken breast prepared with minced garlic and green onion.  Delicious and simple.  The sauce doesn't take very long to set up once added to the pan.  I will make this again.  Thank you, foodgu1!

This was absolutely delicious. I just have one recommendation for people using frozen cooked shrimp... make sure you defrost it and drain it well. If you do not do this, the shrimp will let out a lot of liquid in the pan, and you will end up with a big watery mess. What a great alternative to ordering in Chinese food! Making this at home cost me less than half of what ordering in would have!

Can't believe how easy and yummy this was!  There were no leftovers.  I tripled the sauce, used 1 pound of shrimp, a bag of baby broccoli florets and served over rice.  Definitely will make again.

Great dish.  
Just the right amoung of spice (I like spicy).  I added some broccoli which added to the dish.  I agree with most other reviews - double the sauce.  I actually did not have anyn ginger or honey and it was still great.

I took the other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce. Highly recommend. Also I cut down on the cornstarch and even that I used only half the amount it was still way too much. I had to add a bunch of water and soy sauce to smooth it out. I also added more honey and red peppers. There was still something missing. I also added carrots and broccoli. It needed some vegetables. Color combination looked very pretty. I will try this again, but next time with regular white rice instead of jasmine rice. The overpowering jasmine flavor took even more away from this recipe.

Phenominal dish!  It would taste great as beef or chicken too!  Serve with fried or white rice and a salad and bread and it is even good for company. It will be impressive to anyone who stays for dinner.

I wish I could have rated this with 5 stars but it just didn't turn out as I had hoped.   Because it has had such wonderful reviews I thought I had done something wrong, but I didn't - read the recipe very carefully.   First, it needs less cornstarch and I am going to try making some changes.   Did not like the ketchup taste, but that all depends on the brand you use I suppose.   Anyway, I feel with a few changes it is a keeper.
For now I am afraid it's in the trial stage.

I doubled the sauce as other readers suggested. It made plenty. It is an outstanding way to make shrimp. Just spicy enough and then the sweetness comes in to soothe. I love this and will definitely make it again. Even tasted great the next day at work.

This is a great recipe. I made a few adjustments; I added sesame oil to the canola to equal a Tbs, and also added a little 5 spice. I also sautéd carrots with the garlic, and added fresh steamed  broccoli toward the end. I served it over soba noodles. My kids loved it!

A definite keeper!!  I did use fresh ginger root minced instead of ground ginger and raw shrimp. Also cooked the garlic, green onion and shrimp in toasted sesame oil. I doubled the sauce and added sesame seeds, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts to the shrimp and sauce for that Asian feel. I served it on Basmati Rice. I also steamed broccoli, minced garlic, sweet onion, red bell pepper slices and Asian baby corn and added it on the rice with the shrimp in the center.  Will be making again and again, thanks so much for sharing!!!

Yes, I made changes.  I sautéed 1/2 of a large red bell pepper along with one small zucchini and 1/2 of a red onion first. Then proceeded with recipe as directed and doubled the sauce as other review with the exception of the crushed red pepper. It was super delicious!

Definitely double the sauce...so good!  I have made it a few times. Tweak the red pepper and garlic  more or less depending on who you are feeding. Spring for ginger...I use the tube from the produce department.  I serve over rice and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro if you have available.

Really good and super easy. I didnt have chili peppers so I used cayenne pepper and I put 2 cups of broccoli in for some veggies. I also used uncooked shrimp and cooked them 1.5 min per side in the oil, garlic, green onion pan then added the sauce and broccoli. Didn't take too long to bubble, which is good because the shrimp didn't over cook and the broccoli was cooked but crunchy. Will make again!

I made this for dinner this evening for the first time.  I used sweet chili sauce instead of ketchup.  This was served over rice.  The rice soaks up the delicious sauce.  This was good and easy.  Nice surprise.

We loved this recipe! Being BIG Chinese/Asian cooking fans, I'm always looking for new, tasty, ideas.
I did double the sauce, due to serving w/steamed rice. I added the raw, peeled & deveined shrimp at the end, along with handful of Bean Sprouts & roasted Sesame Seeds for a little added crunch. A Big hit for the family. Thank You for sharing!

The family is free to be critical (& sometimes they are) because then I know what to, & what not to fix again. But this dish received rave reviews! Everyone kept repeating how excellent it was! Needless to say, this will be a regular. It's quick & easy, & it's good enough for company too. The recipe is perfect as written, but the sauce was so good, I'll make more next time. One member is gluten free so I just add La Choy Soy Sauce to his dish, cooked separately from the main dish cooked with Kikkoman Low Salt Soy Sauce.

This was terrific. I added extra ginger and red pepper flakes. Next time I'd double the sauce and probably add vegetables of some sort. Very good.

This was great!  I make a lot of Chinese at home and the recipes can get complicated.  It's nice to find a recipe like this once in a while that is easy and quick to make, and really tastes good.  I always add more garlic and used chili oil instead of pepper flakes (some like it hot, as they say).  I made the dish through the sauce stage, adding a little dry sherry so it could simmer until I was ready to eat.  Then to keep the shrimp from over cooking, I tossed it into the sauce at the very end, and let is cook until the shrimp was opaque.  Very tastee!

It was really good, but I added red bell pepper and I wonder if it would be better if I also added broccoli and cashews - it definitely needs more vegetables. Served it on ramen noodles and that was awesome!

I made this awesome dish last night and it was perfect!!  The only comment I wanted to make is I doubled all the ingredients and it turned out still light on the sauce.  I'm new to cooking so I'm out ideas, I'll leave it up to the pros!! But this dish made me look like a pro so thanks for sharing!!!

The only reason I'm giving this s a 4 star is there is no way this feeds 4 people! 
it's quick!!!!!!!
I should say American people!  There are only 3 of us and I didn't get to eat because there would not have been enough for the husband and a 16 year old boy.  Now...if everyone eats like mice....then maybe!  Change the recipe to 8 servings or double it and that should feed 4.  Now...flavor is good, the only thing I changed was the amount of red peppers as I'm not into spicy food...and go figure I didn't get to eat it anyway but I did taste one shrimp.  I used 1/8 tsp and it was the perfect amount of heat for me.  This dish was definitely good and I would make it again maybe even using chicken.

I have made this several times and it's always great. I used real grated ginger and add green beans or other veggies and will sometimes serve over rice noodles. Delicious sauce, sometimes I double everything for extra sauciness. Great flavor and heat. One time I did use dried ginger and my husband noticed right away and didn't care for it.

This was soooo yummy! Definitely a keeper. My husband and I like a bit of spice and this recipe was just right. It can be easily altered by using less red pepper flakes. I added snap peas because I wanted to include a vegetable. It was a real hit n

For being my first time making shrimp, I couldn't have chosen a better recipe. I followed some of the previous reviews and tripled the sauce (with exception of the red pepper and the ginger powder, which I only doubled)  since I added stir fry vegetables to this recipe. The end result was amazing and my boyfriend, who is not a big fan of spicy food, loved it :)

Easy and quick. Because I had a lb. of shrimp, I doubled the sauce recipe except for red pepper flakes and it was still quite spicy. Definitely need some rice to tone it down. Very tasty and will make again. Love that you can use shrimp already cooked but would work with raw shrimp too.

This recipe  is so simple, quick and delicious! I have made it several times!  The only things I change is I use raw shrimp as people suggested and fry the shrimp, garlic and onions in sesame oil. I also use only 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes and double the sauce recipe because it's so yummy!  Everyone who has tasted it wants the recipe!

The flavor was pretty good but still lacking. The second time I made this,I had to double the sauce to make enough to sit on a bed of rice.After sauce was done,I added some sriracha sauce and that helped a lot. I will make this again but with the changes stated.Thanks for the recipe.

AWESOME!  I used uncooked shrimp which I peeled and added with the onions and garlic.  I skipped the red peppers as we are senior citizens and we want to see tomorrow.  I did add water chestnuts and next time plan on adding broccoli too.  It was a great addition.  I will double the sauce with the additions.  Hubby raved over this and I will be making it again.  Thank you FOODGU1 for sharing!  UPDATE....doubled the sauce and added broccoli = double awesome!

Loved this! I made a few changes to this recipe though. I really wanted to keep the ingredients as raw as possible so I used a tomato instead of ketchup. I diced it up fine and added that. I also added red pepper and mushrooms. The end result was really good! I'm not sure how it tastes with ketchup but the tomato version was fantastic.

I made it but I had to add some additional ingredients to the sauce.  I added a tsp of sesame oil, more crushed red peppers, a tablespoon of brown sugar, more soy sauce about a teaspoon more and some fresh ginger....much better sauce!

I'm a terrible cook and this was great.  I used sesame oil because I bought it once for a recipe and haven't used it since.  Also added red pepper, onion, mushrooms, and sesame seeds.  Definitely double the sauce and next time I will cut waaaay down on the red pepper.  I also used raw shrimp because they are so easy to cook and taste much better.

This is definitely a keeper!being Chinese myself,I am even impressed by how easy and quickly you can get this meal ready and how tasty it is! Will definitely triple the sauce though to get a nice sauce on my rice! Use raw shrimps adds freshness to the flavor, dry the shrimps with kitchen towel to make sure they fry nicely in the pan. Make sure you take them out after abt 80% done,and throw them back in after veges and sauce are ready. In this way the shrimps are done just right and are never tough.

So fast and flavorful, but for best flavor use raw shrimp. It only takes a few minutes to cook up the shrimp. The other change I made was to use less red pepper and garlic to cater to my husband’s tastes, and it was excellent.  I recommend doubling the sauce if you are serving it over rice.

Four stars because it's good as written. Five stars with a few tweaks!  I doubled the sauce,cooked it separately, and added it to the shrimp after sautéing. I used raw shrimp and fresh ginger. And used the pepper flakes for the saute (a little more flavor for the shrimp).  Loved it!

I felt this was good, but not as fantastic as the other reviewers said it was.  It's an easy meal for those nights when the fridge is looking empty -- if you have shrimp in your freezer and condiments in the door of the fridge, you can have a tasty meal.

So YUMMY! We have made this twice in a row (since discovering it two days ago). Everyone loved it, and wanted more. The second day, we used chicken breasts instead of shrimp. Turned out just as delicious. I did make some slight changes. I added more red pepper, more veggies, used fresh ginger, used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, used less ketchup (the first time I made it with the amount in the recipe, it was a bit too ketchup-y for us), and added a pinch or two of sugar to the sauce. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you FOODGU1 for the recipe!

Can't express enough my Disappointment! BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.. it is completely tasteless except for the heat from the pepper flakes. I've had szechuan shrimp before and this taste nothing like it.. it actually taste like nothing! I followed the recipes exactly so it's not me.

The flavor was great, just the right balance of sweet and spicy. So easy to make too! I'm always on the lookout for recipes that are quick enough to make after work on weeknights, and this definitely fits the bill! We felt there was too little sauce compared to the amount of shrimp though. We're probably going to double the sauce ingredients next time.

This was super quick, super easy and super tasty! I kept some of the mix separate before adding the pepper, as my kids don't like spicy. My boy who is usually a picky eater gobbled up his shrimps, despite never having had shrimp before. Next time I may try it with prawns, and may try with raw rather than pre-cooked as like another user mentioned, it is easy for pre-cooked to become a bit rubbery. 
Tip: Double the sauce ingredient measurements.

I love this recipe, but I do adjust it a little. I double the sauce part of the recipe and add water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and baby corn. Its just like they serve up the street at the local Chinese restaurant.

SO GOOD. We were out of honey so we ended up using agave nectar and substituted Bragg's Amino Acids instead of soy sauce. It was wonderful. Pretty dang spicy, that's forsure, so make sure and lessen the kick if you can't handle heat.

Double the sauce and add some asparagus a few minutes before adding the shrimp. Eat with quinoa for a wholesome, quick and delicious meal.

I wait to add the spice to the adults’ plates until after the dish has been has been plated.  That way my kids will eat this… and love it. Also, doubling the sauce is a must with my family. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe for 4 servings and found that although we love spicy food, the amount of red pepper flakes was a little too much for us. However, the dish was absolutely amazing!! A big winner in this house. Loved how easy it was.

Very versatile recipe!  For my first time making it, I tweaked it a little--okay, maybe I tweaked it a LOT.  Instead of shrimp, green onions, and garlic, I used a 1-lb bag of deluxe stir-fry veggie mix and 3/4 lb of sliced up pork chops.  After stir-frying those for 7 minutes in sesame oil (more oriental-inspired than vegetable oil), I added the sauce in (which I doubled, except for the cayenne--just added a pinch of that) and ta-da!  I was done within ten minutes.  Was totally delicious (though I think I won't eliminate the garlic next time; it did end up a little bland).

We made this recipe as is other than using fresh shrimp instead of precooked. It was worth the extra time. We served it with white rice. Our 12 yr. old grandson loved it. Next time we are going to use fresh ginger and fry it with the onion & garlic as well as adding the red pepper flakes to the oil. I think this will only enhance all the flavors. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was very easy and quick to make which is always a plus in my house. I followed recommandations from previous reviews and doubled the sauce, next time I will event triple it to make sure to coat all the rice and add salt and pepper to it. I also added peas and small bit of broccolis and it went very well with the rest!

Incredible!  I used frozen, deveined shrimp, tripled the sauce and at the end, threw in a large bag of frozen Chinese vegetables that I had cooked and drained.  As for the crushed, red pepper, I only used the amount called for in the regular recipe, 1/2 tsp.  We are not real big on too much heat.  My husband said I nailed the heat perfectly and that it still tasted like Szechwan!   I'm so happy to have this recipe in my back pocket!  It will be made again and again.  Next time, I might try it with chicken!   Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe FOODGU1.

Awesome!
I chopped red and green pepper and fried with green onions. Then added uncooked prawns. Cooked that for a few minutes before adding sauce (which I tripled because I had a bit more prawns than recipe called for)

Update: made again. This time fried up regular onion then peppers, snap peas and garlic. Then added scallops for a few minutes then added uncooked shrimp. (Used half scallops and half shrimp...adding up to about 1 lb). Prepared 3 times the sauce but used only 1 tsp of  the crushed pepper flakes. We found it a bit spicy still so will use only 3/4 tsp next time.

Wished I could give this 8 stars! Fantastic recipe!  Took some advise for other reviewers and used uncooked, peeled shrimp.  Added fresh Broccoli in conjunction with green onions and garlic.  Served with homemade rice which I had added 1/2 cup diced carrots, 1/2 cup diced green onions and 1/4 cup of frozen peas.  If you are worried about the heat of the this dish, start with very little red pepper flakes.  

FoodGu1, thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.  This is a keeper in my recipe book!

Great recipe.  I made it exactly as written. I added some broccoli crowns at the same time as the shrimp and sauce just to make it a one pan meal.  My husband loved it. Will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe twice, and every time I have it, it never lets me down. I have a 6 month old and a 4 year old. I'm a stay at home mom and so cooking quick foods that allow me to get back to tending to the little one are a must. This meal is actually made in 20 minutes. Now for me, I actually do use raw shrimp instead of pre-cooked because I think it retains it's moisture much better so it does take a bit longer for me. The juices keep the shrimp succulent, so I don't mind the sacrifice in time amounting to about 3-6 minutes. My daughter is use to spicer foods and loved it (the honey flavor in the sauce I think is what she likes the most). Overall, a simple to make dish that packs a lot of flavor and punch. If your child is sensitive to spicy flavors, just cut back on the crushed red pepper, but you will end up with a sweeter shrimp so it won't be "schezwan" persay. This is also a good recipe to just make batches of and freeze for quick meals. I also would recommend coconut rice with this (that is what we eat it with). You can store the coconut rice in your fridge in a closed container for several days and you'll have an easy dinner to whip up in the event you are short on time or just plain tired!

I make this all the time. It is quick and easy and I may add delicious. As recommended I use raw shrimp they cook up quickly and also fresh ginger. It is great for company they love it. I also recommend doubling or tripling the sauce. Works well with chicken or beef.It is also healthy.

Excellent recipe I really liked the taste.I used a pound of shrimp and thought that it sucked up the sauce so next time I make it I'll make more sauce, also I added a whole teaspoon of the crushed red peppers because I like a little after burn.I only got two servings out of this recipe though.

I was dubious about the ketchup, but this was actually really good. I made it just a smidge more spicy by adding some Sriracha at the end of the cooking, and I will make it again, for sure!

This is really good.  I've made it twice with good results both times.  Tonight I added 1 tablespoonful of hoisin sauce and the juice of half a lime to the sauce. Fabuloso! Oh yes and a tablespoon of fresh minced ginger with the garlic and scallions. Just did this a third time -- added 1 tablespoon fish sauce and juice of one lime to the sauce. Yum!

I searched on and off for probably more than a year, looking for the perfect sauce for my homemade stir-fry. THIS IS IT. It is perfectly spicy and flavorful, and completely healthy (I leave out the cornstarch, because I don't need it to be thick -- runny is perfectly fine!) I double this recipe and make it as a sauce, to go with my 8-10 cups of chopped veggies (I use a whole onion, several carrots, broccoli, and two colored peppers) and 1 lb of diced cooked chicken breast. It is PERFECT. After my chicken and veggies are cooked and combined, I throw this sauce in the pan over them all, let it simmer for a bit, and eat it  over rice. We have this for dinner twice once a month; it is my go-to for stir-fry now. And it's not too spicy for my less-than-two-year-old (although she handles spicy things well). I am SO grateful I found this :)

Wow! thats all I can say. I served this on a bed of rice noodles and made a couple changes. Sadly, I had no ginger but i did have an asian sauce with ginger so i dashed a little of that. I added veggies so I made 3x the amount for the sauce. so good! will do again.

Loved it!  Great meal to throw together. Perfect blend of tangy, sweet, and spice, without any of those flavors overpowering.  I used a 1lb of shrimp and doubled the recipe for the sauce since I was putting it over udon noodles and broccoli.  Didn't have cornstarch so I used flour. Definitely adding this to my recipe bag-of-tricks since I usually have all the ingredients on hand.

Amazing dish... a full 5 stars!
I did what another reviewer recommended and upped the amount of water for the sauce to 5 tablespoons of water. Added some chopped red peppers to the garlic and green onions and then tossed in the shrimp and sauce. Once the sauce was bubbly and hot, I added some blanched broccoli and topped the dish off with some fresh green onions for presentation. Yummm! This is definitely a staple to my weekly menu now!

Delicious and easy. I used raw shrimp as it taste better (usually cheaper) and it only takes less than 5 mins to cook. I would also suggest doubling the ingredients for the sauce. If you don't like spicy then reduce the red pepper flakes.

Very yummy without any modifications, except using wild rice.  Next time we need to remember to make a veggie side with it as we were still hungry after each eating half.

My man and I love this Chinese dish. I did make a few changes though. I marinated the shrimp in Old Bay seasoning before cooking (only an hour), used red onion instead of green and used a dash or two of chipotle seasoning instead of the cayenne since that's too spicy for us. Served it over rice and we both went YUM!!

I made this tonight. I added yellow pepper and pea pods to the recipe. Instead of rice, I used quinoa. It's much better for you, and it doesn't taste much different when you have a sauce on it. My family liked this so much, that it's become part of our recipe rotation.

It's so quick/easy to make and delicious. I grated some fresh ginger instead of using ground, and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I love using sesame oil in "Asian" dishes -- it's so much more fragrant than vegetable, canola, or even olive oil. If you've never tried it, you must try it. I also doubled the sauce and added a 1 lb bag of frozen mixed veggies. YUM!

We just made this for dinner tonight. It's fast, easy, and low fat--just what I was looking for.  I only made a few changes, I used fresh ginger, left out the red pepper flakes (to make this kid-friendly), and used half the amount of oil.  I marinated the shrimp in the sauce for 30 minutes before adding the cornstarch, then while frying the shrimp added the cornstarch to the sauce.  I fried up some shredded carrots, shallots, and red bell pepper with the shrimp and served with rice and roasted broccoli (I thought the crunchy texture of the roasted broccoli really complemented this!).  My picky toddler took one bite and then refused to eat anymore (as normal) but then when he thought we weren't looking shoveled the rest into his mouth--he completely cleaned his plate.  Delicious and easy!

Just the way my mom makes it! If you like it more on the sour side of "hot and sour" or "sweet and sour" add vinegar to taste. I use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar.

I would actually rate this 3.5, if I could. The taste was okay. It was bland and I added much more honey and soy sauce at the end. I tripled the recipe to have more sauce, so maybe that threw off the flavor. It was VERY easy and I had everything in my house to prepare it. I also use raw shrimp and sauteed in butter, garlic and a little soy sauce. Not sure if I will make this again. BUT, my husband did eat it and said it was okay to pack for lunch the day. He's very picky.

This is a really good recipe that is very easy to make.  Don't make my mistake.  I didn't let the shrimp thaw all the way before I put it in the skillet.  This of course created a lot of water.  I did drain the water with a paper towel before I added the mix.  But I wonder how much garlic flavoring I lost.  So let shrimp thaw first and pat dry with paper towel.  Even though I made that mistake the shrimp was still very good. Oh. Liked the review that suggested using raw shrimp b/c they cook so fast.  This is a great tip.

My husband loved it. The first time I made it I did not have honey on hand, so I used 2 packets of Sugar in the Raw. All I added was a teaspoon of hot sauce. I just made it last night with honey and both ays were very comparable. I will make this again for sure,thanks.

OMG!  This recipe is shrimpaliscious.  I used 2 elephant garlic cloves which was perfect for the dish.  Didn't have any crushed red pepper------and I'm glad-----it was perfect without it.  I also used raw shrimp, which I added to the garlic and green onions only after this mixture cooked for at least 3 minutes-----just until the garlic was a golden color.  Cooking time for the shrimp was about an additional 3-4 minutes----just until it was nicely pink. . Final result-----shrimptabulous!

While I enjoy the "heat" of this recipe it is lacking in the subtle layers of flavor traditionally found in oriental food. I will try fresh ginger and maybe some rice wine next time.  I also always use fresh uncooked shrimp to avoid the "rubber shrimp" problem when reheating cooked shrimp.  Last thought, to lower sodium use low sodium soy sauce and maybe fresh diced tomatoes from my garden??? in place of ketchup.

Love the sauce.  There was no need to double it like other reviewers suggested.  I prefer to taste the shrimp and not have it smothered with too much sauce - so for me .... the recipe as written worked fine.  Served over jasmine rice.  Will definitely make again.

I really liked this! I made only a few adjustments but not major ones. I place of crushed pepper I used chili pepper, and instead of green onions I used green and red pepper. I also added broccoli and put it over rice. It was amazing! I do have to agree that raw shrimp would be better as pre-cooked DOES become a little rubbery. However, it was still great and turned out wonderful.

This recipe was excellent and very easy.  I used uncooked shrimp, as I find cooked shrimp does not have as much flavour. Based on other reviews I doubled the sauce, but I think I would go 1.5 ratio next time.  Served over steamed Jasmine rice, with steamed broccoli on the side. Very healthy dish.

I liked this recipe. I doubled ingredients (except for the red crushed peppers) and I also used fresh shrimp. Towards the end I added in frozen sweet peas. I served it over hot white rice. Yummy,tasty and best of all you can control the level of spiciness.

Soooo yummy. :) I followed the rrecipe as is. Don't let the ketchup and ginger part scare you because I was hesitant. I am so glad I made this.I added a pinch more of the red pepper since I like spicy foods. It was perfect.  Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this yummy dish. I can't wait to make it when I have company over. Definitely a 5 star recipe all the way!!!

I've made this three times since finding the recipe a week ago, I love it! The sauce is the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. I used chopped ginger root instead of powdered ginger and it came out perfectly. This pairs really well with sautéed veggies and rice. It also saves and reheats well, so doubling the ingredients to make leftovers is a great idea. I found a new staple!

SOOOO yummy!!! I didn't have time to read over the suggestions before trying this recipe out, I was in a rush, so I jotted it down & cooked it right away. It was perfect & SUPER easy! I cannot wait to try it again, maybe even tomorrow night with chicken that needs to be used before it expires. Great recipe! Literally took 15 mins to make!

This review is just for the sauce--I made a chicken and vegetable stir-fry. I have to say I was more than a little nervous when the sauce was just mixed but wasn't thickened. It didn't particularly taste good and the cornstarch gave it a grainy taste and texture and the crushed red pepper made it surprisingly spicy--and I love spicy food. The ketchup seemed to be the only flavor that was coming through and that wasn't exactly what I was going for.   So I started thinking "who are all of the people who rated this so high?" Are they just all tasteless semi-homemade cooks? I almost threw out the sauce completely after I started fretting about ruining my $12 package of m organic chicken with company on the way. But I trusted in the reviews and I was so glad that I did! My mother LITERALLY licked her plate and my 10 year old picky nephew went back for 3rds. Even my naysaying husband who is always saying that Asian food is impossible for non-Asians to pull off was thoroughly impressed. I only wished I had made more.  I made the sauce exactly as specified in the recipes but at the last moment in panic I added a squirt of honey. It all worked beautifully. What I made: I cubed and marinated the chicken in a ginger soy marinade while I prepped the veggies. I cut up broccoli, onions, red pepper, bok choy and sliced garlic. I cooked the chicken first and then set it aside while I cooked the veggies. At the end I added the sauce and added the chicken back in until the sauce thickened. Yum

Great recipe! I added broccoli florets and doubled the sauce. Came out great. My boyfriend loved it, he ate so much he couldn't move afterwards!

I love this recipe, and fix it at least once a week since I first saw it.  It's really great if you like shrimp.

Spicy!  Didn't use green onions, but did use raw shrimp which we sauteed in the oil and garlic before adding the sauce.  I'd like to cut back on the red pepper flakes next time, but my husband wants to keep the full-strength heat.

As of today, I have prepared 559 different recipes from the allrecipes website. This five-star Asian recipe is definitely in the top 10% of those I have tried. I am Chinese food aficionado. Chinese is my very favorite ethnic food category and given a choice, I would eat Chinese food three or four times every week. Szechwan Chicken is one of my favorite dishes, so when I discovered this recipe, I had the strong sense that I would like it. Like it? My entire family loved it. Admittedly, it's not the best I've ever had. Some Chinese restaurants are nearly unbeatable, but for something that can easily be prepared at home, and can be considered healthy eating to boot, that's enough to easily make this a five star recipe. I paired it with couscous, added some water chestnuts, used a two-pound bag of shrimp, and quadrupled the sauce. It was perfect; fan-stinkin'-tastic!

This was fast, easy, and healthy! I used sliced ginger instead of ground ginger, and I added mango, yellow peppers, and I served it over rice noodles, shredded cabbage, and topped with wonton strips. Next time I'll add snap peas. A+!

This is a flavorful and delicious shrimp dish with just the right amount of heat.  And, it's an absolute snap to make. Use fresh ginger if you have it, as it really adds flavor.  I also use raw shrimp instead of already cooked shrimp because shrimp cooks so quickly.  This recipe has become one of my go-to recipes for when I don't want to spend a lot of time cooking but want to make something tasty and fresh for my family.

I added green peas and peanuts, and would definitely add them again.  I served it over rice.

super easy and really authentic tasting. the only thing that I would change is that I would add shrimp to oil first to grill slightly and then add garlic and onions and cook slightly. Then follow recipe but use fresh ginger if possible and a spicy type ketsup. A keeper

This is hands down my favorite recipe I've found on this site. The sauce has such amazing flavor, just the right amount of kick, and I would definitely suggest planning to have extra to pour over some steamed rice. I took a previous reviewers advice and used real ginger rather than ground and I think that does make a huge difference. I will be keeping this recipe to use over and over!

Fantastic, the flavor is perfect and does not overpower the taste of fresh shrimp. I made mine with the shell still on since I think it makes it juicer and I replaced crushed red pepper with a bit of sriracha since I did not have red pepper.

Great recipe!  Easy, fast, and delicous.  Doubled the sauce, added snow peas and shitake mushrooms.  Next time will try cutting the red pepper in half for a little less kick.

Shallow flavor. It was totally edible, no one complained. but I think with some nice fresh ingredients like real ginger it could have really benefited. On the other hand, it was super quick and easy to make! Also, DO NOT use already cooked shrimp. Even with uncooked raw shrimp you're going to have to be seriously watching the shrimp before it gets overcooked or too tough.

Just to reiterate: Things I would change: Fresh uncooked shrimp, real ginger. It'd probably be a better dish then. Good luck!

These were good but not fantastic.  Great base, it's just missing that asian flavor.

This was a hit with my husband - he used a fork instead of our usual chopsticks, saying he "wanted to be able to eat it faster"! haha Very nice flavour. We doubled the sauce as suggested and it made a good amount for mixing up with a few stir fried veggies and rice.  Nothing wrong with pre-cooked shrimp, just don't leave it on the heat more than 2 minutes or less (you won't need to).

Bought the House of Tsang pre-made szechuan sauce to cut out half the time.  Added pea chutes, bean sprouts, carrot matchsticks, sliced red and green peppers and sauteed them in a wok for about 10 minutes so they had that charred look to them before adding the shrimp and szechuan sauce.  I made some brown rice ahead of time and refrigerated it so it cooked up nicely as fried rice in a cast iron pan.  I made a whole in the middle of the fried rice and scrambled two eggs.  After the stir fry was done and the shrimp were opaque, I blended with the fried rice and served everything together in one dish.  The House of Tsang szechuan sauce was perfect but is pretty spicy, so be sure not to add too too much just for the color if you can't take the heat.

I'm really sorry to say this, but I really did not care for this recipe. Sauce was unappealing and I could really taste the ketchup. I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is a keeper. I made some changes. I don't use ketchup so didn't have any. The cooked shrimp were from a frozen shrimp cocktail so I used the cocktail sauce instead of ketchup. I used fresh ginger,  as another reviewer suggested(I like it better also.) I added a bag of frozen Birdseye Broccoli Stir fry, I put the veg in first and let it cook and the pan dry out. Then added the garlic and scallions. I was afraid of overcooking the cooked shrimp, so I put them in at the very last second, even after the sauce, and just stirred through to warm the shrimp and coat with sauce. I served it over rice. Yummy!

I followed the recipe precisely and served the dish over white rice.  It was excellent however the sauce thickened too quickly and the sauce became pasty.  Next time I will cut the corn starch in half.

Super delicious! So quick and easy to make. I doubled the sauce recipe. Cooked carrots, sugar snap peas and red bell pepper in the pan for a few minutes then added sauce and shrimp and cooked it down for maybe 5 min longer. Served it with brown rice. Will be for sure making this one again!

The ratio of quick, tasty and low cal makes this an easy 5 star.  

I'll summarize a few of the other reviews but first my own suggestion:

Suggestion: Use a little less corn starch if you want sauce for your rice. The amount given gives a glaze rather than a sauce. 

Make double sauce: YES, DEFINITELY! Especially if you want some on your rice. 

Use fresh shrimp: YES, so much fresher tasting and the shrimp don't get over done.

No Taste: Well either you are used to REALLY spicy food or your red pepper flakes are years old. They do loose their flavor after a while.

Tastes like ketchup: I didn't find that to be true at all, but I blended the sauce ingredients with a whisk very well, and had fresh ingredients.

All in all - we loved it, stuck to our diet and it was quick and easy for a Friday after a long long day of work. BRAVO

OMG, amazing! I have made many stir-frys in my day and this was absolutely the best one I have EVER made. I changed nothing in the sauce except using chicken broth instead of water, and because I had no honey, used about 2 tsp of maple syrup (tripled the ingredients for more sauce). The sauce was fabulous! I'm skeptical when a recipe calls for ketchup and another sweet ingredient like honey, but this was just the right amount of spice and sweet (neither me nor my family like alot of sweet in our meals). It worked soooo well! Tripled the sauce because I used jumbo shrimp and added lots of veggies, served it over chow mein noodles. Absolutely to die for and I will never buy stir-fry sauce again. Thank you FOODGU1! Everyone in the family absolutely loved it!!

I love love love this!  I follow the recipe, however I do double the amounts.  I like to spoon some extra sauce over my rice.  It does lend to the richer side of sauce, which my husband dislikes.  I would happily eat this everyday.  Sure it would be equally as superb with chicken.

This was super fast, tasty and spicy!  I followed other reviews and doubled the sauce.  I also added a little bit of bell pepper and some snow peas.  Served over sticky rice and it was great.

This recipe was a good one, but it did not make enough sauce for the rice side dish.  I actually made the original sauce and then made an additional mixture X 4 to get enough so the shrimp wasn't dried out nor the rice I served it over.  It is a tad bit spicy (my lips and tongue went numb) however my son in law loved it! Said it was perfect. Will I make it again YES, but I will temp down the heat for us . Thanks for sharing this one.

Really didn't work for us. I am not a picky person, but I couldn't finish my serving. I followed the recipe as written, but I think the ketchup overpowers everything, and I can't think of a substitution that would make it better.

As written, this is a good 4-star recipe.  However, with some additions this is a 5-star yummy.  I added sesame oil, 1 tbls of honey, sesame chili oil and oyster sauce.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients then used raw shrimp and cooked it in peanut oil, garlic and green onion.  While the shrimp cooked, I threw the sauce in and let it simmer.  The additions made this spectacular and highly suggested.

I thought it was good and spicy, but it didn't seem like a "restaurant" meal. I tripled the recipe as suggested and added in my own chopped stir fry veggies of celery, red bellpepper & onions. I think next time I will reduce by 50% the amt of ketchup & honey. It was a bit too sweet for my tastebuds. The ketchup was a bit over powering in taste and like another reviewer said, it really didn't smell good while cooking.

pretty good start. I didn't have any green onions, but added fresh broccoli in their place and served over white rice and topped with toasted sesame seeds. I think I would double the sauce next time, maybe that's why it was just good for me, but very easy.

Very Tasty. I added garlic to the sauce instead of the shrimp and blended it in the small food processor.  Note the sauce burns easily and thickens quickly so I added a 1/2 cup of Campbell's chicken broth. I also omited the red pepper and included about 2 cups of pre-cooked vegetables (carrot, bok choy and sugar snap peas).  Added cashews and served over rice.

So yummy! We use raw shrimp to avoid having the dish come out chewy. We add carrots, pea pods, onions, broccoli and celery to get our veggies in. We always double the sauce too! This is great over steamed rice served with Crab Rangoon III recipe (baked, so it is healthier). This is a favorite in our rotation!

I didn't care for the flavor of this.  I think it's the ketchup that I don't like but I can't pin point it.  It was easy to make but will not make again.  I believe there are better recipes for shrimp.

I made this last night and also tripled the liquids for more sauce and it was perfect.  I would add more red pepper next time.   What an easy and fabulous dish, perfect for company.  Tastes like a restaurant entree.
Nice with brown rice

Not a fan of the flavor of this dish. I do, however, like the technique of blending all the spices and cornstarch together and add the liquid at end. I would just experiment with different spices.

I made it exactly as directed, except I doubled the sauce.  I didn't think it was too spicy.  I actually thought it was just right.  That being said, though, I felt that every other aspect of the sauce was bland.  Maybe if I made it again I would try more soy sauce and ginger.  It was by no means bad, I just thought there would be more flavor, looking at the ingredients in the sauce.

A very good meal. I paired this with couscous (because rice would have taken too long). I also stir fried sliced carrots, snow peas, peppers and spinach. I recommend doubling the sauce and making it ahead of time. This will be a go to recipe for me.

These were really good!!  I served mine over a bed of spinach (not wilted or cooked), only because I was serving a Creamy Avocado Pasta alongside, and I wanted each dish to 'stand alone' so to speak.  I opted to use fresh ginger instead of ground as I felt it went better (typically have only used ground ginger in baking that I recall).  I did not have any green onions, so used a 3 onion mixture (dried) to saute with my garlic.  This was quick to throw together, definitely spicy mixed with a hint of sweetness.  Would be even better served over rice, opposed to the way I served it (over the spinach - LOL)!!  Great :)

Thank you so much for sharing! I make this on nights when my BF and I feel like having Chinese but I don't want the guilt of take out food. I always double the sauce (we like it hot so I double the Crushed Pepper too) and mix in a bag of mix veggies (Asian blend). So good, so quick! Thanks!

Wow. If I had a blindfold on I would swear this came from our local Szechuan restaurant. Soo good. Only one recomendation, if you like it to have a real sweet and spicy taste, I'd add more honey. It was more on the spicy side of that spectrum. AMAZING recipe nonetheless, thanks for sharing!

Not bad at all. It was pretty tasty and the kids liked it too. A much more healthy version of what you might get in a take-out. I added much too much honey by accident. It tasted good, but next time I'll try a little less sweet.

Very good.  I will add this to my recipe box!  I did make a few changes.  I added about 1/4 teaspoons of 5 spice chinese seasoning, 2 tablespoons of dry cooking sherry, and I did not have any green onions so I just threw in some shallots.  Very good, hubby wanted more!

WOW, best I have ever had even better than a restaurant. I used 2# of fresh shrimp, quadrupled that sauce, used a fresh jalapeno instead of the red pepper and prior to adding the shrimp, I added about a cup of broccoli, 1/2 cup of bok choy and 1/2 cup of slivered carrots. Any veggies would work, should have thrown in some peas, yellow and red pepper may have been nice. We are fighting over the leftovers. Dish was enough for 6 people with brown rice.

Loved this recipe! Quick and Delicious. I did use raw shrimp so that they wouldn't overcook, other than that made the recipe exactly. My 2 year old wanted to try it so I let him and he devoured it!! Will definately make this again and maybe add some veggies next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was outstanding and super easy. I did make a few variations.  I mixed all the ingredients together (less 1/2 tsp of cornstarch) to make a marinade.  I put the shrimp on several skewers, marinated them for 10 minutes, and grilled them.  I heated the remaining marinate for a minutes until cooked through and bubbly. I served the skewers over jasmine rice and garnished it with sliced green onions and cilantro.  I had a leftover yam so I made yam chips...Wow!

I made this for the boyfriend and he was pleased. I intended to make it just like the recipe stated. However, I brought all the ingredients over to cook and when I got to the honey I noticed I forgot. No problem I thought because I'm sure his family has some. Nope! Sugar. None! Brown sugar. Nada. His family are all diabetics! Who doesn't have ANYTHING sweet in their house. Finally I came across I can of mandarin oranges in light syrup. So I decided to go out on a limb and use the syrup instead. It was good!! Who would thought...ORANGES! The flavors had a lot of depth. It was the right mix of hot and sweet. My boyfriend was like how did you know to do that? I added a some steamed broccoli in the with the shrimp and poured over a batch of white rice. I sprinkled black pepper over the finished product for presentation. I was impressed with myself!

This turned out awesome. I do have to admit I made some small changes. You HAVE TO double the sauce. You just don't get enough sauce with this recipe. I used Chinese noodles as some suggested. I also added five spice, but I'm sure it tasted fine without it. I love vegies and shrimp so I probably threw in some extra. Great recipe poster.

This was a super easy meal that even my 19 month old loved!  I doubled the sauce but only used about 1/4-1/2 tsp of the red pepper so the little ones could enjoy it.  I also started with raw shrimp but other than those two changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definately make this one again!

This was as said " a simple and impressive dish"!  I do not like shrimps very much, but this recipe had me really thinking about the next time I will make it!  So easy to make that it made it to my  list of meals under 30 minutes which I have for week-days cooking after work! Absolutely wonderful and the hubby gave it 10 stars! (he doesn't know the rating scale, but this attest to the taste of the dish!)  Thank you for the recipe!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly - not good.  It was much better the second time when made using fresh ginger and raw shrimp. Next time I will double the sauce as there isn't quite enough when served over rice.

Meh...  Way too sweet for my taste, but I like a more savory szechwan.  My husband liked it, but he really enjoy sweet Chinese dishes.  if I make it again, I'll use more of the savory ingredients and skip the honey.  Maybe less ketchup, also...

The sauce was really good. We followed the other comments and doubled the sauce; however, we also should have cut the amount of the crushed red pepper. The hubby probably would have preferred the sauce with chicken rather than shrimp. It's an okay in my book.

This recipe is very easy and quite good, but I think that the sauce needs more of a pop of flavor. I would recommend that you add the garlic, FRESH grated ginger, and scallions to the sauce, then add sauce at the end as the recipe directs. That way the garlic and scallions aren't overcooked. The fresh ginger is really needed too. Additionally, it's a good idea for you to double the sauce and add veggie to the dish instead of having to make a second veggie dish. Just saute some broccoli or add frozen vegetables to the dish along with the shrimp. Yum!

I thought this was great!  I tripled the sauce and it was just the right amount for us.  Next time I will try it with fresh ginger and cut down on the cornstarch a bit.  It was a little thick for me, but I also think I may have made an error in measuring.

This was really delicious and yummy. I cut down a bit on the spice (just a pinch of red pepper) for personal preference and used a pre-frozen, deveined and headless shrimp package. Usually I like to use fresh shrimp for cooking but since this recipe has so much flavor from the sauce, it really doesn't matter. Make sure to use large shrimps if you can, otherwise cooking it with the sauce can cause it to pretty much disintegrate. I also recommend that you thicken it up with a slurry of cornstarch if you want to put some sauce on rice. Stir-frying or steaming some green vegetables to mix in with it is a great idea too. Otherwise, the flavors are great! Definitely a keeper for my arsenal of easy meals.

My sauce didn't thicken up enough, so next time I may cook another minute or add a little bit more cornstarch. This would be good with veggies sauteed with the garlic, too.

One of my family's new favorites! I added shallots on step 2 and just put 1/2 of the red pepper for the little mouths in the house. We serve them with chow mein noodles. Great recipe!

This was a quick recipe to make and very tasty. I added sliced carrots and broccoli to mine and had it over brown rice. I only gave it a 4 stars because it was a little spicy for us and it really needed more sauce next time I will double the sauce and add less spice. overall a good recipe.

This was very delicious.  The sweetness and spiciness for the dish was perfect.  However, I do agree with some other users who have rated this recipe that it's better off the use raw shrimp than pre-cooked.  Using pre-cooked shrimp turned out very rubbery and chewy.

Whew! This is spicy! Next time I'll adjust the 1/2 tsp of red pepper down to 1/4 tsp.  It was VERY good, lots of flavor.  *Definitely* recommend doubling the sauce.  Also, I added cooked broccoli towards the end, which gives it a nice bulk and added vegetable.

Great Recipe, I tripled the sauce and used 1 lb. raw shrimp and I used Sesame seed oil as one reviewer suggested. I also added a bag of Asian style frozen veggies and a small can of water chestnuts. I thought it was a bit spicy for my taste so I will tone down the red pepper next time. I served over brown rice ( I used the microwaveable frozen bag) instead of white rice. I also topped it with sesame seeds at the end. Very good! Sure beats paying for take out!

This was delicious. It was quite spicy, but you can tone down the amount of red pepper flakes to suit your tastebuds. This was very easy, and I served it over white rice.

Was just okay, probably won't make again. Can't put my finger on it but it was missing depth of flavor.  Still looking for a great Szechwan Shriimp recipe.

This is easy, fast, healthy and good! I made the recipe exactly as is and served over rice to my husband and 4 teenage boys and it was liked by all. The next time I think I will double the sauce just to have a little more sauce over the rice. Thanks for a great recipe!

Doubled the sauce, added some leftover broccoli, didn't have enough green onions.  I did make all of the sauce ingredients as per the recipe, and I debated between 3 and 4.  I would like to give a higher rating, but have been trying to be consistent:  3 is okay; 4 is very good.  I actually think the sauce might be better without cornstarch, maybe even as a marinade.  I had to add more water to my sauce as it was too thick.

I also doubled the sauce and used 1 lb of raw shrimp instead of the pre-cooked shrimp. This dish is fast, healthy, and excellent if served with brown rice.

Quick and healthy earn this recipe 4 stars for me. But the sauce doesn't completely blow me away to warrant 5 stars. But its still a good recipe. I'll likely make this one again.

Such an easy & fast meal to make.  The only change I made was to decrease the crushed pepper and added a few dashes of Sriracha hot chili sauce.  Would absolutely make it again.

We really liked this and as the designated cook who's currently 8 mos. pregnant, I appreciated the ease and quickness that this came together!! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding an additional 1/4 tsp red pepper (my son wasn't home and DH and I like it hot!). Also, I did NOT precook the shrimp. Overcooked shrimp is rubbery so I just added it raw and cooked it until opaque before adding the sauce. To me, it lacked a little something though so I think I'll try adding some rice wine vinegar to the sauce next go-round.

This is very good, and very easy to make. I used frozen shrimp, and it came out great, just made sure they were cooked thoroughly before I added the sauce. It became nice and thick, and the contrast between sweet and spicy was really good! Served over unseasoned ramen.

My husband said this was good, but for me it was just okay--I guess it was the ketchup.  (My husband loves ketchup.)  I did double the sauce and used fresh shrimp.

I am not a stir fry person, but I was feeling adventurous.  I used this recipe as a base and added other veggies - broccoli, carrots, sugar snap peas, bell pepper.  Served over steamed white rice.  Good flavors, I enjoyed this.

I'm with others there is something off about it but couldn't put my finger on it - ketchup?  I have been eyeing this recipe up for a while and was a little dissapointed.  I even used fresh shrimp.  Made it for friends and had left overs.  I may make again for BF and I for a easy quick meal but not others.  Thank for sharing! Cheers!

So easy, and the sauce is delicious!  Hands down, this is my boyfriend's favorite dish!  I double all ingredients (except the shrimp), prepare as stated, and serve over rice (Minute rice at that, which makes the meal even easier and super fast).  He eats the entire pound of shrimp himself - in one helping!   I've also tripled the sauce and added some leftover boneless pork chops cut into strips in with the shrimp.  Delicious, and it makes the dish friendly for those who don't eat seafood (like ME!), because the shrimp flavor doesn't permeate the sauce or the pork!  (Phew!)  If I could have rated it six stars, I would have!

Fabulous!  I doubled up on all the sauce ingredients and it seemed to be just enough.  Next time I will halve the amount of red pepper as my family felt it was a little too spicy--we were all taking sips of water after every bite.  Very delicious and easy!

I read the reviews, and to say I was disappointed is putting it  mildly.  I added some red bell pepper chunks, and sauteed my shrimp since it was uncooked, but the sauce was not good and did not even remotely taste Asian in my opinion.  The ketchup and ground ginger (rather than fresh ginger) should have been a hint to me.  Sorry, but the only reason I'm giving this one star is because we did eat it, the shrimp were tender, but beyond that, I have nothing good to say.

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I think I would prefer Sriracha instead of chrushed red pepper flakes for the heat, and I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  I agree with other reviewers to increase the sauce.  Actually, I made four times the amount called for and added some canned water chesnuts and baby corn.  Delicious over jasmine rice!

This was a great quick recipe but I had to up the heat factor.  I added a couple of serrano peppers, a couple of teaspoons of chili-garlic paste and topped it off with some siracha when it was served.  I followed previous suggestions and doubled the sacue which ended up being the perfect amount.  I also stir fried some fresh veggies which I mixed with the shrimp to make a complete meal.

This dish needed a lil extra sweet, so I added more sugar and honey.  Being part Chinese, this dish does no taste authentic but it is good for what it is.  I think this dish is similar to another Chinese dish that typically made with pork spare ribs.

I used fresh shrimp (not frozen) and cooked in olive oil prior to mixing with marinade.  I also doubled the recipe and mixed in shrimp and stir fry veggies (also fresh, not frozen), and served over steamed white rice. It was a hit. I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks for sharing it!

I probably won't make this again..I have been cooking since I was 5yrs old...lol..not a joke though...I don't know..this recipe just did not work well with me or my finacee...he loves my cooking and everything I usually make is loved by everybody even the most pickiest eaters..this sauce was way too ketchupy for me..did not taste asian at all...I even added fresh ginger to it to give it more of an asian flavored dish...it wasn't bad..but a waste of all the shrimp I used...I really don't understand how this was rated so high...it blows my mind..I'm not a very picky eater but to call this szechwan shrimp...thats what I was expecting..not trying to be mean by any means...just trying to give it my honest opinion...maybe omitting the ketchup all together and adding more honey would have made it taste more authentic to me..=/

Great recipe!  I doubled the sauce as well as added minced red pepper when cooking green onion and garlic.  I served it over rice.  Delicious!  My husband and I loved it.

This was awesome maybe cut the pepper flakes - use uncooked shrimp - triple the sauce - serve steamed veggies on the side- possibly add veggies last minute to shrimp and sauce serve over white rice. Yum!  Not for kids unless cut way back on red pepper flakes.

Excellent.  Great with shrimp but I'm sure it would taste just as good with chicken or beef.  I added a package of frozen stir-fry veggies, which made it even better.

This was really good and the sauce was amazing. I tripled the sauce but only doubled the red pepper. It was plenty spicy and we like spice. I also added green peas, carrot strips and fresh broccoli served over rice. I think I might try this with chicken too!

Very good! I accidently added too much red pepper, well I knew I was adding more but I didn't really realize I was gonna make it THAT hot. I knew my boyfriend wouldn't be able to handle that much spice so I added some pineapple chucks. It calmed it down a bunch. I also added a bag of broccoli and cauliflower to the mix and served over brown rice. Such a great meal!

I thought this lacked flavor, all I tasted was spicy. I should have known better when my son looked at the ingredient list and scoffed. Does not taste authentic at all.

Great way to make shrimp when you're in a hurry! I added a couple drops of hot sauce and it still wasn't very hot. I will try adding a little more next time. Served over white rice. I will definitely be making this again.

Very good!  My husband really liked it too.  I doubled the sauce based on other people's reviews, and we thought it was too much.  I'll stick to the original recipe when I make it again.

Awesome! this is a staple in our house. It's so easy - we always have all the ingredients on hand. I don't change anything about the recipe. Sometimes we coat the shrimp in an egg/cornstarch batter and lightly fry for fun.

This was O.K. and it has potenital. I doubled the recipe. It was not as spicy as I had hoped. Next time I'd double the about of the red peper flakes. It still had the ketchup flavor so maybe adjust the honey and soy sauce a little b/c I'm not the biggest fan of ketchup. But it is easy to make and has potenital.

My husband was a little skeptical when he saw the ingredients but it turned out to be great. I ended up making 3x the sauce and adding two bags of frozen stir fry vegetable and used uncooked shrimp. We will definitely use it again.

Really like the flavor, I like the sweet and spiciness of this dish.  Hope to get better shrimp next time and service with rice.  I served with noodles, which was good, but would go better with rich.  5 stars for how easy it is!!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise. If it tasted as good with my substitutes, I would've given it 5. I used onions instead of green onions and brown sugar instead of honey. I also tripled the sauce and used fresh broccoli and mushrooms. I cooked the vegetables on in different pan at first since I wanted to make sure the broccoli cooked thoroughly. My boyfriend said it was one of the better dishes I've made, which is truly suprising. I couldn't get a compliment out of him even if I went fishing for it. I'll definitely make this again, next time with the right ingredients!

Very good. I was amazed at how well the sauce turned out with just a few simple ingredients. I will make it again. In my opinion this recipe doesn't come into it's own without the addition of at least one veggie. I added broccoli.

WOW - this is so good.  I made minor changes, I used a pound of raw shrimp and cooked that a bit before adding the sauce.  I tripled the sauce and it was a perfect amount.  However, next time I won't triple the corn starch because it got really thick, I think just doubling the cornstarch and tripling the rest would be perfect.  I served it with vegetable fried rice and that was a perfect compliment to this spicy shrimp.   I want to note that you really don't want to taste the sauce before it's cooked because it definitely tastes like ketchup with some stuff in it, but once the heat is put to it and it simmers it is amazing.  My daughter said it was much better than any take-out due to the great flavor and because it wasn't greasy like a lot of take-out Chinese food can be. OK - one other thing I did - I have this obsession with making stock, so I just cooked the shrimp shells in about 1/2 cup of water for about 10 minutes till it reduced in half and then added the resulting stock to the sauce.

Excellent recipe!  I invited family to eat so I actually tripled the sauce recipe and doubled amt of shrimp.  Used fresh ginger, low salt soy sauce and uncooked shrimp.  Otherwise, followed recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper.

So easy, So yummy!  I doubled the sauce and served over steamed rice.  Hubby and I are doing Weight Watchers and, as written, this recipe is only 3 points!  I add a little more red pepper for heat and a bunch of veggies (green pepper, onion, broccoli) to bulk it up.  Love, love, love this recipe!!!

This was really easy and good even for a week night.  I doubled the sauce, added some more red pepper and ginger and used fresh shrimp.  If shrimp is not on sale, I plan to use thinly cut chicken strips and use this sauce, after stir frying the chicken.  Served with white rice, sauce was excellent over the rice.  Thanks for sharing.

This was marvelous!  It's very very good.  Dh would have preferred a little more spice...I doubled the sauce and used 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  If you like spicy, try a bit more!  Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent! I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested but added only 1 tbsp of ketchup and 2 tbsp of chinese chili sauce! I added scallops, shrimp, and squid to this stir fry. What a winner!

This is a great alternative to ordering out.  Plus you can control the amount of salt.  Although there are a lot of ingredients, it is well worth dragging everything out.  This taste like you ordered it from your local Chinese take out.  I only use a pinch of the red pepper though, this can become very spicey, very quickl!  We love it over noodels, rice or any other pasta.  A great meal!

I honestly did not like this recipe. It wasn't terrible but I thought it tasted very ketchupy. It just wasn't what I was looking for, hoisin sauce instead of ketchup might help. Won't be making it again though.

This was really good! I thought the sauce was awesome and both prep & cook times were very fast. I didn't find it too spicy even though I added a little extra red pepper, but I could see this recipe being too spicy for younger children. Adjust the amount accordingly.

I used 2# raw shrimp; tripled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the red pepper and garlic, though I used 4 very large cloves. I also added mixed stir fry veggies and served over rice to stretch it.

This was pretty good, but I don't think it deserves the 5 star rating it's been getting.  The ketchup flavor was a little overwhelming.  If I make this again I will halve the ketchup and increase the crushed red pepper (there was very little heat for a Szechwan dish).  It was a good elementary dish.

Wow -- an easy, relatively fast, reasonably healthy, and completely delicious meal that can be made with inexpensive kitchen staples.  I modify this somewhat when I make it, to include more vegetables.  I make a triple batch of the sauce, then add about a pound of frozen stir-fry vegetables at the same time as the garlic and green onions.  Then I proceed with the recipe as written, with the rest of the ingredient quantities as written.  It's perfect.  Many thanks to FOODGU1.

Yummm!! Can't say enough about it, everytime I make it I change the veggies I put in it to accommodate what I have on hand that needs to be used and it is always good! I've even used imitation crab instead of shrimp, I also like making extra sauce and adding brown rice to the mix.

As a native Chinese, I cannot stand buffet-style food. However, the popularity of this recipe made me curious. All I can say is WOW!!!! This dish is delicious!!! I tripled the sauce, added frozen vegetables, left everything else to the T, and sauteed. The heat in this dish is perfect! (Note: Sichuan natives like their food HOT!) The flavors compliment each other very well. I have to admit, I went back for seconds before my plate was even empty! Thanks so much for the recipe! I can't wait to make it for my mom!

This was ridiculously easy to make and yet it tasted like you spent a long time on the dish.  I tripled the sauce based on other reviewers' suggestions and I'm glad I did.  You can make the sauce ahead of time, then just throw everything into a skillet for a few minutes.  Super simple.  I added a few more red pepper flakes for extra oomph.  It was the perfect amount of "heat".  Served it with asian veggies to make it a super healthy meal.

I would absolutely make this again. It was fantastic. I stir-fried some vegetables (onion, carrot, red pepper, snow peas, mushrooms broccoli) and doubled the sauce. I also paired it with the Asian Coconut Rice recipe on this site. The combination was great.

Excellent.  Great easy recipe.  Impossible to mess up, which I like.  I am a novice cook and simple recipes are for me.  Making the sauce ahead of time is a great time-saver. I threw in a bag of stir-fry veggies (cooked) and it was delisous!!

DELICIOUS! Great flavor for such a quick and easy  recipe! I tripled the amount of sauce (because I wanted a lot of sauce to serve over rice) with the following changes: 12 tbsp water, 8 tbsp ketchup, 4 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tsp honey, 4 tsp cornstarch, 3/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. I like spicy food but if you don't I would recommend cutting down the crushed red pepper. I also used 1 lb cooked shrimp, 4 tbsp minced garlic and 1/2 cup sliced green onions. I served this over white rice and made the Tasty Green Beens (on this site) as a side. It was a perfect, quick, and most importantly TASTY dinner fully made in about 40-45 min including prep time!

LOVED IT! I am never ordering out chinese again. Right amount of heat for me, but you might want to half it if you prefer something mild. Next time I will add veggies. Tasted so good with some brown rice. Yummy!

Wow!!  Nice flavor and rediculously easy. I used 16 oz of shrimp and doubled sauce recipe-glad I did-and served on basmati rice.  I used raw shrimp and cooked it with the onions and garlic. Sauce was a tad spicy for me, but everyone else though it was just right. Next time will add water chestnuts for texture. Sauce is versatile and goes well with pork and chicken also.

Delicious!  My boyfreind and I both loved this one.  I added in small pieces of steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots for an all in one meal and it was so good!  Such a great little kick after each bite thanks to the red pepper.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I guess I had pretty high expectations with all of the rave reviews.  I thought this was ok, we ate it, but I won't make it again.  The ketchup flavor was too stong only masked by the spice - there just wasn't a lot of complexity.  I had fun trying it, but now it's time to move on to some more exciting new recipes.

I love this! This is perfect as is but i'd recommend doubling the sauce, using extra garlic, using UNCOOKED frozen shrimp, and some kind of green veggie(brocolli or sugar snap peas are great). This is my absolute dinner dish and everyone loves it! The only real work is cooking the rice for it. This is amazing. Oh, if you do you cooked shrimp, be sure to not overcook it or it may be rubbery. Thank you so much for this recipe! (:

Seriously, could this recipe be any easier or quicker...and it is so good!  I was surprised, as I am not a ketchup fan.  The recipe is great as is, but I have made a few changes for my family.  I double the sauce ingredients, replace 1 Tbsp of ketchup with 1 Tbsp chili paste.  I also use about 2 tsp of freshly grated ginger instead of ground ginger, I think that makes a big difference.  I add some veggies, and viola, delish meal in minutes.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe!

My husband really liked this and wanted more so next time I'm going to double this recipe.  Fed  the four of us but small portions. I subbed broccoli for the green onions and sugar for the honey and used fresh grated ginger (about 2T).  Instead of water I used fish sauce and also added about 1T of Tobasco to my sauce as well.  I had some fresh chilis so I chopped up those and sauted them with the broccoli.  Cut back the chili flakes to 1/4 tsp.   This recipe was fairly easy and delicious!Thanks! :)

Delicious!  I tripled the sauce because I was serving over brown rice.  I also added scallops and veggies to the dish so it was a heartier meal for several people.  The veggies were a bag of the frozen asian mix which I boiled and drained then added after the shrimp & scallops had cooked in the sauce.  Turned out great, and will definetly be making again, maybe with chicken, snow peas & red peppers. Thanks!

This is the perfect recipe to use up shrimp that has been in the freezer too long.  I stir-fried veggies in the pan first and then followed the recipe as is and it was great.

Can't believe how fast this is!  It's great because it uses common ingredients.  Next time I'm short on time and thinking take-out, I'll break out the frozen shrimp and whip this up instead.

I was all ready to like this dish because of all the good reviews, but I just didn't. The ketchup had a funky after taste. My hubby and I thought it was okay when we ate it, but no one would touch the leftovers.

A great, easy recipe.  I used raw shrimp as others have recommended and also mixed in a bag of asian vegetables and served over rice.  My whole family enjoyed it including my kids...ages 5, 9 and 13.

This was very good and easy.  I used raw shrimp (1 pound) since they cook so fast.  I doubled the sauce as everyone recommended and was glad I did.  Served over steamed rice.  This was enough for one generous serving each for my daughter and me.  You will want to multiply the recipe if you are serving more than two people.

Edit:  Made this again 8/15/10.  Tripled the sauce, used 1 lb. raw shrimp, also stir fried some fresh broccoli.  Boiled 8 oz. whole wheat fettuccine and tossed this in at the end to make a lo mein.   Fantastic!

Can I give this 10 stars?  This was so easy and is better than my takeout place.  I always have the ingredients in my pantry.  Give this a try you won't be disappointed (but do double the sauce..I couldn't get enough of it)

This recipe just gets it right! I doubled the sauce (except the red pepper-I knew 1/2 t. would be plenty for us) Added fresh broccoli and snow peas and used fresh ginger. Really Good. Much better than our local Take-out!

The taste of this is great, the texture ruined it for me, it's kind of 'goopy'.  I think if I made it again I would use less corn starch.

It was really good! So quick and easy to make.  I did what others had suggested and tripled the recipe for the sauce, and also quadrupled the red pepper, and added 1 teaspoon of ground garlic.  I also added 1 bag of frozen stir fry veggie mix after it had already been prepared.  I also added some black pepper to the garlic and green onions.  My mother even enjoyed it and she is very picky.  My new favorite quickie meal!

The sauce for this dish was great. I doubled everything for the sauce. I also added zucchini, asparagus, onions, green peppers and water chestnuts sauteed in olive oil. I served it with spaghetti. Loved it and will make it again.

Amazing! Put the shrimp over rice and doubled the sauce mixture to have extra to mix in with the rice. I also made steamed veggies and mixed them in too. I used garlic powder instead of cloves which worked fine.

This seems to be either a "Gimme More" or "Throw It Out" dish.  Just did not like the sauce at all.  I  like Szechwan recipies, especially the very spicy ones, and have made a minor hobby of cooking Szechwan meals.  I agree with all those who say this sauce is not representative of most Szechwan sauces. Most call for chicken or veal broth or stock instead of water, although not all. Many also call for various amounts of vinegar  And, while not unique by any means, honey is not an ingredient common to the majority of sauces. My advice is, make the sauce, try it.  If you don't like, throw it out.  If you do, then by all means, put it on your shrimp and enjoy.

This was really yummy, but I did add a few of my own touches. I sauteed the shrimp until almost done, then removed to a plate. Steamed broccoli and carrots in the microwave for 5 minutes, added to pan with garlic and sauce until the sauce started to thicken. Then I added the shrimp back in until it was cooked through. My husband loved this and after we were finished with dinner, he said "Now you know why I don't like ordering in Chinese. This is much better." So, thank you, for a wonderful base recipe on which we can all build upon. Oh - and by the way .... the leftovers were incredible because the flavors in the sauce intensified.

This sauce wasn't bad, but I have had far better. First of all, it was a little too garlicy (and I like garlic!).  Second of all, as with all Asain dishes, balance of flavour is key.  This dish did not balance, since it lacked the tang that stir-fry dishes need. Tip: for greater complexity of flavour, use fresh ginger.

We added some snow pea pods, broccoli and yellow peppers and used coarsly chopped sweet onions. Enjoyed this one very much.

I have made this several times now and always get positive comments.  This taste as good as what they serve in restaurants.  It has the perfect "bite", which is subtle, and the sweetness added to it is wonderful.  I will continue to prepare this for guest who think I spent a lot of time preparing this dish.  I would not change a thing about the ingredients.

The recipe was fine, my problem started when I read people's suggestion. Never again will I be using frozen broccoli. Fresh definitely the next time. Not sure what people were thinking by using frozen. I also used frozen uncooked shrimp with tails removed. Never used raw shrimp before, definitely the way to go.

This recipe has way too much corn starch for the amount of sauce (which is not really enough anyway). Even after thinning the sauce, I wasn't impressed with the flavor. The shrimp should be added at the last minute to heat, since they are already cooked, or they will end up tough. I can save the leftovers by adding and tweaking, but can't really recommend this recipe as it is written. Sorry!

Mmmmmm this was delicious!  SO much flavor!  I ended up throwing some thinly sliced steak leftovers in there too and it was AMAZING.  I only used half of the red pepper flakes (my kids don't do spice very well) and it still had a good, strong kick to it.  I'll probably have to reduce it even more next time for them.  Thanks!

It is one of the best chinese shrimp recipes I have made so far.  So easy to make.  We are used to eat pretty spicy food so for me it is not that spicy so I add a little more red pepper flakes or "sambal oelek". I will continue to make this recipe.

Excellent!  Doubled the sauce and used uncooked shrimp based on other reviews.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and served it over rice.  Think it would also be good with veggies added.  Will definitely make again!

So good and so healthy!  I stir fried 3 cups of broccoli and 3 carrots (sliced) before adding the garlic, green onions and then the RAW shrimp (I used 16 oz instead of 12).  After the shrimp started to cook (approx. 2 mins), I added in the sauce (which I tripled).  I cooked for an additional 2 minutes (approx.).  This made just enough sauce for it all and the addition of the veggies made it a complete, healthy meal.  Great recipe.

This recipe was so good.  I was a little intimated because although my favorite kind of food is asian, that is what I cook the least of.  So, I was nervous about it not tasting like what I get in the authentic "restaurants".  And to my surprise it was just as good, if not better.  It was very easy to make and the ingredients were so simple, mostly stuff I had around the kitchen already.  I didn't have to go to an Asian market.  I will definitely make this again soon.  I did add some sauted zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli and tripled the sauce and I made a side of white rice and they were perfect compliments.

This was a good dish...I didn't have any red pepper flakes so I used a bit of cayenne pepper.  I also doubled the sauce recipe, used 16 oz of shrimp, and added a bag of stir fry veggies with pasta.

It was fun to surprise my family with something different!  It was quick, easy and delicious.  I doubled the shrimp but tripled the sauce, and am glad that I had done so.  We also liked putting half the garlic into the sauce, rather than all of it with the onion.  Appreciate the reviewers who say what worked well for them - thanks.

This was really good.  I like spicy food, and even with additional red pepper it was still not quite spicy enough for me, so I'd like to maybe turn up the heat somehow.  Also, I doubled the recipe and still think I could have used a bit more sauce once I added the vegetables.  I added a head of steamed broccoli and 3 carrots to the shrimp and sauce.

I made this with freshly shelled & deveined shrimp rather than the precooked.  Like many others I added veggies. Fast, easy, tasty dish.  The only detractor about this recipe was as it cools on the plate the ketchupy taste took over.  Perhaps it's my brand of ketchup?  Will make again to see if this can be corrected.

This is an easy and very flavorful recipe!  Like others, I made the sauce exactly as the recipe states, but did add red peppers and broccoli to the stir fry.  I suggest easing into the crushed red pepper and adding it gradually if possible.  It was a tad spicy for me, but that is purely a personal preference; after all, it is Szechwan...  I will definitely make this again, and may use the sauce recipe for chicken or beef.  Thank you for sharing!

I was REALLY surprised at how well this turned out. I was definitely skeptical of the ketchup, but it all came together to make a delicious sauce. I was out of cornstarch, so I used a teaspoon of flour instead. I can't handle spicy stuff, but my fiance loves spice so I made it according to the directions and figured I would just have something else for dinner. However, it wasn't all that spicy, I was able to eat it without any problem. I added some broccoli and it was a delicious meal served over white rice. This will definitely be on our menu again, thank you so much!

My husband and I loved this easy meal.  I did double the sauce.  For 1 Tablespoon of the ketchup I substituted 1 tablespoon of Thai Sweet chili sauce.  I did not have any green onions so I just used a white onion.  I served this over brown rice.  Thanks for a easy and delicious meal!

Very good! I used bbq sauce since I didn't have ketchup, and it worked well. It wasn't overly spicy; just had a little bit of a kick at the end. It was so easy, too. Definitely a keeper!

I was a little put off when I saw ketchup as one of the ingredients but I tried it out anyway. I was impressed with how good it was. I served it with a fried rice recipe from this site and added a little more of those red pepper flakes.

This is a delicious dish!  I add about 1 1/2-2 cups of shredded carrots just before I put in the scallions.  It adds a little sweetness which contrasts well with the spicy.  Thanks for this easy wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe.  I made it last night and my boyfriend (that I cook for everynight) is still talking about it today.  It was soooo simple.  I had all of the ingredients in my pantry.  I added: frozen snap peas, red bel pepper, broccoli, carrots, couliflower, and I doubled the sauce because of this.  Also, I would recomend using raw shrimp.  It cooks quite quickly when you add them.  I will be making it again this week.

WOW!!!
This was a great recipe.  Although I used 2 lbs of raw shrimp and doubled the recipes.  Added some broccoli to it and served it with white rice and garlic bread.  The only thing I would change is add more honey so it can get that sweeter taste but other than that it was great.  Will make this again.

WOW!! This was sooooo DELICIOUS!! I would not have thought to mix these ingredients together to make a sauce but it really was good! I did double the ginger to give it a more authentic chinese restaurant taste! I sauteed white onions, bell pepper, and minced garlic first. Then added some frozen stir-fry vegetables that I steamed in the microwave. I also used RAW shrimp (as suggested by another reviewer because i feared if they were pre-cooked they would turn out tough) SO GLAD I DID!! Anyway I then followed the recipe as written, cooking until the shrimp were pink and tender (about 5 minutes) It was great! Even my VERY picky boyfriend asked for seconds!!! I will defintely be keeping this recipe on hand!

This was great!  So quick and easy!  The only thing I changed was to add fresh grated ginger with the green onions and garlic rather than powdered with the other ingredients.  If you keep your ginger root in the freezer you can grate it frozen straight into any dish.  I think the fresh flavour of the ginger gave the szechwan a more 'authentic' flavour.

Wow this was so good!  Made the house smell like a chinese restaurant.  I doubled the sauce, used fresh chopped ginger instead of ground, added half a red pepper cut into strips, and served over rice.  I used raw, frozen shrimp which I thawed and sautéed before starting the garlic and onions.  Will make this again!

Very tasty and not too spicy.  I used frozen cooked shrimp and took them off the heat as soon as they were warm through to avoid overcooking them.

This recipe was so easy.  I used fresh shrimp and I only added about 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper and it was hot enough for us.  Also I added stir fry vegetables and tripled the liquid ingredients as someone had suggested. I served it with rice.  I will be making this again.

This is by far the best szechwan shrimp I have ever had - anywhere!  It is simply delicious.  I'm a novice cook, and I prepared this with no problem at all.  I will say that if you don't like spicy foods to be VERY CAREFUL with how much of the red peppers you add.  I wasn't really paying attention and must have dumped a ton in there, because the dish was way too hot (my fault though, not the recipe's!).  You might want to omit the red peppers all together the first time.

This dish is absolutely delicious. If you want your guests to think you spent all day in the kitchen then serve this recipe.  It is super easy and has a beautiful presentation when served over rice. Add whatever vegetables you like. I chose brocolli and a yellow pepper.  You can adjust the crushed red pepper to taste. We like spice and thought the amount listed was perfect.

This recipe was extremely easy to make!!  I doubled the sauce and served with jazmin rice and steamed broccoli and carrots. We loved it!
I will try to make this with chicken as well, for a healthier alternative.

I was very disappointed with the results.  I made it with chicken and added vegetable and cut down on the red pepper and it was very, very bland.  My husband thought we should try it again and let the chicken marinate in the sauce but after eating the leftovers for lunch today, I don't think it's worth making again.  It was very simple though.

Great!  The sauce is flavorful and tastes like chinese take out, without the cost or hassle!  Doubled the sauce and used chicken/broccoli.  You could use this sauce on any meat/veggie combo.  Thank you for this one!!!!!!!

I loved it!  I didn't have green onions, so I used a regular yellow one.  I'm sure it was a different flavor, but it was still very good.  Next time I'll some lightly steamed broccoli or another nearly cooked vegetable to the step when the sauce is added.  Add some more veggies and you have a whole meal in one pot!

I made this recipe last night and I loved it! Being a vegetarian however, I decided to put my own twist on it. For the portion of the sauce, I increased it to a 6 serving portion, and used tofu instead of shrimp. I browned the tofu in olive oil first, then added the onion and garlic when the tofu was slightly browned on all sides. After heating the garlic and onion for 30 seconds or so on medium heat, I added about a pound of mixed vegetables to the wok and turned the heat up to med-high for several minutes. When the veggies started to soften I added the sauce and reduced the heat back to medium. This took only about 10 minutes total, and was totally rockin' when it was finished. Served over white rice, it was just fantastic! I hate leftovers, but this was still awesome when I reheated it today! Thanks!

This is so easy and so quick!  I tripled the sauce, using only 1/2 t. crushed red peppers (homemade, very hot) and 1 lb. raw jumbo shrimp and 10 oz. frozen chopped broccoli.  Not having green onions, I used Vidalia.  I do wish I had green onions to garnish as it would have been perfect!

The sauce was really good; however, as others have stated, it was too dry.  I doubled it, and it still was not saucy enough.  I decreased the crushed red pepper to 1/8 tsp for 4 servings.  I added broccoli, red pepper, and carrots and served it over brown jasmine rice.  I will make this again, but next time I will make more sauce and add a little more shrimp.

This was very quick and easy.  I made it with double sauce, and it came out great.  It had a kick to it which we all liked.

This was easy and delicious!  It reminded me of a dish I recently had at a popular and pricey Chinese bistro.  I doubled the recipe and served the shrimp with a mix veggie stir fry.

This recipe gets a 4 because of the ease of preperation.  Very simple.  I also think that the taste was a bit simple.  I will need to play around a bit to add some more flavor.  I will make this again though.

This recipe has great flavor, but is very spicy. A little too spicy for my kids, so i had to make them something different. I loved it. I served it over rice, but i still felt it was missing something. I am going to add fresh brocolli next time. I also doubled the sauce mix as recommended in another review. Great recipe.... I will be making this one again.

This was excellent! If I hadn't made it myself, I would never have guessed that there was ketchup in it. It was a touch spicy for us, so I'll do a little less red pepper next time. It really reminded me of something from the chinese place.

I was very disappointed after reading the reviews.  Just didn't care for the taste of the sauce - too sweet from the ketchup I think.  But it was too simple to screw up; it just didn't suit my taste, which is just a personal thing!

Very very tasty, also very easy.  I added a small box of frozen snow peas and a small can of bamboo shoots and it was fantastic.  Served with fried rice also from this site.

Wow! this recipe comes together nicely. we doubled the sauce, added white onion, some sliced sweet red pepper (great for color), and in addition to the shrimp some bay scallops. the sauce looked thin at first but it turned out perfectly. served over white rice with edamame and health is wealth vegan spring rolls. definitely 5 stars!

I have made this twice in the past two weeks and both times it was fabulous!  The second time I made it for my boyfriend and it was his favorite thing that I have ever cooked for him.  I will definitely be making this often.  Oh, I triple the sauce and add a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  Great over rice.

It was good. As recommended, I doubled the sauce...Altered the recipe by substituting chicken stock for the water, used 1 lb. shrimp, and added some red onion...also added steamed broccoli at the end. Served over brown rice. Will make again!!!

This is an easy, versatile dish that is special enough for company. I have made it with broccoli, snow peas and carrots. Each time it was a hit. I was happy I doubled the sauce recipe. My first time I was shy about the red pepper flakes. The second time, I hit it with the suggested amount and enjoyed it even more!

The taste was good but I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Ketchup has extra flavours that can really kill the Asian flavor in this recipe. For the first time, I used ketchup and wasn`t satisfied with the flavor at all. Using plain tomato sauce, the flavor is much better. For this quantity of shrimp I didn`t need cornstarch at all, so next time I would increase the sauce ingredients. I am not a Chinese cuisine expert, but I wish the taste were more Asian. Good, but not the same I have tried in Chinese restaurants.

This was fantastic! I doubled the sauce and accidently doubled the garlic but my husband and I love garlic so that wasn't a problem. I served it over sushi rice. A little sweet, nice and spicy, and just plain wonderful! Oh, one more thing, I added broccoli and sliced up carrots and this worked great.

Loved this recipe. I doubled the sauce and used 400g of frozen shrimp. I left out the cornstarch because I didn't have any and it thicken nicely on it's own. Next time I'll use less water(because of the frozen shrimp) and use less red pepper(it was really spicy!)

This is so fast and easy.  I make this a couple of times a month.  It is amazing how tasty this combination of flavors is. We serve it with steamed brown rice. 

My husband &  I love spicy food, but this is hot!  I reduce the red pepper to 1/4 tsp. and omit the green onions (not a fan). Per other recos., I do double the liquid ingredients if I add a bag of frozen veggies, which also turns out great.

This was a great recipe!  Really quick and easy to make and delicious too. I used cut up chicken breast instead of shrimp and cooked it in a little bit of the sauce.  The next time I make it, I will add veggies and peanuts or cashews.

I made this last night, it was very good! I doubled the sauce for the recipe, which I recommend doing, and ended up using the smaller salad shrimp which was very good! Because I'm not a fan of spicy food, I only used 1/4 tsp of the red pepper, and that was perfect for me! Served over white rice, YUMMY!

4 stars only because I had to double the amount of sauce. Delicious and easy. Since my husband and I like spicy I used a heaping teaspoon of red peppers instead of a level one. I served it over linguini noodles, but it would also be great as an appetizer served with toothpicks at room temperature.

My boyfriend was excited I was preparing shrimp, but when he saw me break out the ketchup bottle he got a bit scared. It only took one bite to get rid of his skeptisim though. He loved it and wouldn't stop talking about it. I might have to start making this once a week just to get him to shut up.

This recipe is amazing, I didn't read the reviews before making it and it turned out just perfect and full of flavor. I went for this recipe because I wanted to use some shrimp and I had all the ingredients handy. The only but is the sauce, next time I will be doubling the ingredients for more sauce.

LOVED this dish.  Used 2 lbs. fresh shrimp (16-20 ct., deveined, shelled, tails off); tripled the LIQUID ingredients; doubled the spices, garlic and cornstarch; added frozen stir-fry veggies (cooked per pkg. directions); and prepared in my wok, cooked shrimp 1st then added stir-fry veggies to heat through. Enough to feed 2 adults and 2 teenage boys because everyone wanted seconds!

quick and easy last minute dinner decision. very tasty. i like spicy, so next time I'll add a bit more red pepper flakes. my wife is on weight watchers, so this is a great dish at only 6 points including the white rice.

I think water chestnuts would be a good addition, as well as a variety of veggies.  Great taste, will make again with chicken and shrimp.

Made this for supper last night, intended to make enough for leftovers this week .. no such luck, it was too good, not a drop left.  Nice that all the ingredients are in the house.
Super fast and easy, and yet VERY yummy.  Have already planned to make it again!

This was so delicious. Like many others, I doubled the sauce, and used raw shrimp. I served it over jasmine rice. The sauce was so good. I used medium shrimp, next time I'll use large. I think it would be good over angel hair pasta as well. Whether you use shrimp or chicken, its the sauce that makes this meal. Just the sauce over the plain rice was incredible. Will definately make this again. And again. And again! Part II, I made it again, this time with chicken, equally as delicious. I served it over brown rice, it was great! I'm a garlic lover, so I always add extra garlic. Superb!!!

This was AWESOME! My entire family loved it! I used fresh shrimp and cooked about 2 minutes before adding the sauce. I also added sesame seeds and broccoli. I tripled the sauce but not the red pepper and still had a bite to it. It was perfect! Will make this again!!!

This was awesome. My teenagers had three plates each of it. Even my most picky eater loved it. I used chicken instead of shrimp and it couldn't have been better.

Excellent!  Tripled the sauce like some previous viewers suggested and added about 1/4 lb cooked spaghetti noodles to stir in at the end.

Thanks so much for such a good idea!!

This was delicious! I double the sauce and added a few cut up carrots, broccoli and water chestnuts. It was very easy and my husband loved it (although it could be because I made something from scratch instead of a frozen meal....). In any case, this recipe is definately a keeper.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe!  I doubled the sauce (didn't use any ginger, as hubby dislikes it), added a package of frozen veggies (broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, pea pods)and served it over whole wheat angel hair pasta.  Hubby said he could eat it every week. It's funny, because I tasted the sauce before cooking, and there wasn't much kick to it, and the ketchup really stood out.  However, once it was mixed with the other ingredients and cooked, it took on a whole different taste, and it was really spicy good!!  Thanks!!

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce (excluding the cornstarch and crushed red pepper) like other reviewers stated.  I also added frozen stir fry veggies and frozen young green beans that I first steamed/cooked in the microwave.  I served mine over whole wheat linguine noodles.  SO GOOD!

Delicious! I made a few changes.

I diced a single skinless chicken breast, and threw the piece in a frying pan for a few minutes. While the chicken was cooking, I sprinkled curry powder all over it, in addition to some red pepper. 

I made the sauce described in the recipe, and tossed it with the chicken in the pan for a few minutes. 

I then made Uncle Ben's microwavable long grain and wild rice, and mixed in a little over half of the chicken. It was a huge meal for one person, plus it's healthy, plus I have a ton left over :).

Thanks for the great recipe!

*5* Stars!! This recipe couldn't be easier!  Doubled the sauce (not the cornstarch) and I used teryaki sauce in place of the soy sauce only bc it's all I had on hand.  (I'm sure soy sauce would be better, but this wasn't a bad substitution)  Also, I used some leftover cooked rotisserie chicken (no skin).  I couldn't face chicken salad again for lunch and thought I'd give this a try.  This was just as fast or faster than making a lunch of soup and sandwich.  I will definitely make this again for dinner - especially when I'm facing a time crunch to get dinner on the table.

Quick and easy dish with great flavor.  Didn't change anything with the sauce recipe, but I did double it. Threw in some stir fry veggies and served over rice. Got rave reviews from the 2 people I served it to.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was, considering the ingredients are simple and few.  As did others, I doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the cornstarch; it was still plenty thick.  After sauteeing the onion and garlic, I threw the raw shrimp in and stir-fried them, too.  I added cooked green beans to make it a complete meal and served it over jasimine rice.  YUM!  Will make again.

I thought it was good. I used fresh ginger sliced up because the ground kind just doesn't do justice. Believe me, fresh is the way to go, you can freeze ginger if you are reluctant to buy it for just one time use. We use it all the time and love it.
My kids all enjoyed this dish, I didn't make it with all chili flakes.
The sauce was good and I did double it up to drizzle on top of steamed rice.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! Very, very, very yummy and EASY! I recommend using fresh shrimp (if you have the time to devein- ugh!) as cooking the shrimp from start-to-finish gives it a very juicy "pop" and it just sucks up the sauce.  My "foodie" significant other and I just inhaled this and he was very impressed, calling it "a real success." :)

I was really worried about this being too sweet or ketchup-y so I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  I think next time, I'm going to take the plunge and use ketchup because after tasting regular tomato sauce, I don't think ketchup will "get in the way" and it will be much more convenient!  I doubled everything except for the shrimp, added a 16 oz bag of stir-fry veggies, and served over brown rice.  I also added more crushed red pepper (1 1/2 tsp total) and didn't think it was even close to being too spicy.  I 1 tsp of used fresh, grated ginger (if you've never cooked with fresh ginger before, you've GOT to give it a try -- the powdered stuff doesn't even taste like the real stuff, and it's REALLY not as intimidating as it sounds).  All in all, this was decent.  The szechwan flavor I was looking for was THERE, it just wasn't as strong as I like it.  I'm new to Asian cooking so I'll play around with it a bit more.  Definitely NOT a bad dish, though!!

I liked it very much with a few little changes. I doubled the amount as other reviewers suggested but used less cornstarch the sauce was still quite thick. I didn't have pepper flakes so I used a heaped tsp of paprika instead and a good pinch of chili powder. I marinated chicken in the sauce then stirfried it with vegetables and noodles. Will make this again soon as it is so quick and easy and much nicer than stir-fry sauces from a packet.

This was really quick and delicious recipe.  I like veggies to predominate in my stir fries, so I cut way back on the shrimp and added broccoli, red bell pepper, snap peas, and carrots.  It came out great, but next time I will cut back on the corn starch.

Fantastic!  Just the right amount of kick my husband and I like.  I do double the amount of sauce ingredients to moisten it up a bit.  Highly recommended for those that like hot and spicy foods.

The flavor was excellent...I did add more red pepper as everyone suggested.  However, the sauce was not really a sauce at all...it was congealed and very thick and clumpy...what did I do wrong?  I followed the exact instructions on the recipe.

I was craving Chinese food and wanted to fix a dish that was healthier then buying take-out, this was really easy and healthy (low fat).  My husband liked it a lot.  I've made it twice.

Yummy!  My husband and sister ate this up.  It's a healthy, easy, quick dish with tons of flavor.  I made it as written and served it over brown rice.  I will be adding veggies next time.

This is a great recipe when you don't feel like cooking, it's VERY easy.  The only changes I made were like the other reviews-I doubled the sauce.  And I used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes and added frozen peas.  I also used fresh shrimp and it came out great!!  Will absolutley use again, thanks!!

I thought this recipe was great.  I tweaked it a little to suit my taste, but didn't add any additional ingredients other than those listed in the recipe and it was fantastic.  i'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was great, I made some changes, first I used beef since I didnt have shrimp. I will start following this recipe with seafood, chicken or beef.  I did not have honey so I used 1 teaspoon of sugar.  I also doubled the sauce like everyone else stated.  I used a variety of different vegetables which was really tasty and provided such a wonderful looking dish. I cant wait to try it with shrimp.

I'm glad I made this one.  I doubled the sauce but left out the ginger only because I didn't have any and cut back on the red pepper flakes for the kids.  I used a pound of shrimp and a bag of frozen stir fry veggies then added about 1/2 pound of cooked linguini. It made a ton of food and was delicious!  I will be making this one again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a pretty good recipe, but we would prefer sweeter and spicier.  Maybe add extra honey or some hoisin and extra red pepper.  We also used double the sauce.  Make sure to cook the sauce long enough to cook out the starch flavor of the corn starch. We also chose to stir fry some veggies on the side, broccoli was our choice.

This recipe is really good. I give it 4 stars because it's not as szechwany as the local restaurant we love. In place of crushed red pepper I used 1/4 tsp. of chili garlic sauce for a bit of a kick. I doubled the sauce as well. In place of green onions I used about a 1/2 cup of white onions. Definately a keeper and will most certainly make again.

My husband really liked this dish. We ate it last night and he brought the leftovers for lunch today. I just received him an e-mail from him here at work saying that he just finished eating his lunch and that it was "soooooooo good". I added some frozen stir fry veggies and doubled the sauce as others suggested. I actually didn't feel the need to double the sauce because it was a little "soupy" for me. Instead of ketchup, I used tomato paste and when I added the crushed red pepper, I didn't think it was spicy enough. Then I added the corn starch and when everything started fizzing, THAT'S when I could taste the heat. Unfortunately for me, I had added a little more crushed red pepper because I didn't think it was going to be enough spice. Guess I should've waited until everything was blended together because it was HOT! My husband loves hot and spicy dishes so this is probably why he was such a fan of this one. Definitely not like the typical szechwan shrimp in Chinese restaurants but it was still tasty. The color threw me off too. I wasn't a fan of the sauce color because it made me think that I was eating an italian marinara sauce or something. I was so pleased that this was so easy to prepare and so quick. I served this with white rice. Mine definitely did not look like the photo! I guess I was expecting something a little different based on the picture.

I really liked this...the only thing was the heat was too much (and I eat tabsaco straight on bread and cream cheese) I'll cut back next time. Also because green onions cana be strong I added a few for color and then chopped up one medium thick slice of regular onion since restaurants usually include regular onion. Was worried about the ketchupy taste because I've had Thai food in restaurants with that problem but I didn't think it tasted like that at all. Though if it waas someone who omitted ginger or something I could see how that would happen.

Loved this recipe. It was very easy to make. Next time I will add veggies as others have suggested. I used sliced sweet onions instead of green onions. Also, I will double, maybe triple the liquid contents next time. Delicious though.

Very good!  I made it with fresh ginger which added to its already fresh flavor, but I didn't add enough, so next time I'll add more, but I'll definitley make this again.

This is a very good recipe, taste great, easy to prepare, easy to cook,  taste great on a bed of either boiled/steam rice, just enough spice for heated flavor but not to much to disguise the flavor of the shrimp.  I make it about every week and it goes good on top of mashed patatoes would diffenently recomend it perfect bacholer dish anyone could make this as long as you can read.

Made this last night for a Chinese dinner party, everybody loved it.  I suggest you tripled the sauce ingredients.  Situated in South Africa I was not sure what 'green onions' were and used 'Spring onions' instead.

I modified this recipe to add some veggies...I just threw in a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies when I added the shrimp. Then I served it over ditalini pasta (tiny  cut tubes) since I didn't have rice. DELISH!

Omitted green onion & ground ginger (subbed curry) but still came out very tasty not too spicy.  Served with a side of stir fried mushrooms, celery and onion.  Will make again, thanks!

My family enjoyed this dish; it was very tasty. I don't think it tasted anything like the real Szechwan Shrimp served at most Chinese restaurants though. As suggested by other reviewers, I tripled the ingredients for the sauce, and I doubled the green onions, garlic, and shrimps, and added 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice. I also added about a tsp. of sesame oil. Will be making this again.

We really liked this! We used very good jumbo shrimp. I felt like it needed some vegetables so I sauteed some red pepper on the side and then mixed it in at the end. I probably would not have rated it as high if I didn't have the JUMBO shrimp and red pepper. We served with brown rice.

We thought that this was good. Very easy to make. I don't think the ketchup was overpowering at all. We served it over rice. I did half the crushed red pepper for husband and two picky kids. It was still "hot" enough. Thanks.

Just reviewed and forgot to add, you always want use raw Devined shrimp. Cooked shrimp is only meant for a salad or for shrimp cocktail. I cooked mine in salted better until almost cooked through, added the sauce and stirred a few minutes until thickened.

Loved it.  Used raw shrimp and tossed in pea pods.   Very easy to make and tastes more complicated than it was.

Much easier than my long list of ingredients. That takes a long time to chop. Hubby liked it just as well.

My family liked this. I thought it was only okay. The flavor of ketchup was ther dominant flavor for me. I'm not sure how to fix that, so I probably won't make this again.

This was excellent! Just the right amount of spice. I thinly sliced the garlic instead of mincing it for more of a flavor pop. I served it over fresh linguini. Next time I’ll double the sauce as I could’ve used a little more liquid in the dish. I’ll definitely make it again!

Really nice, easy and super fast recipe for a weeknight. The sauce is wonderful and you can spice it up to the level of heat you desire through the amount of chili flakes you add. I like the flexibility of this recipe. You can add things like red pepper slices, bean sprouts, pineapple chunks, mushrooms or whatever because it will never disappoint.  You can counterbalance the spice with a little bit of sugar as well if you  lean toward a more sweet and sour flavour. Thank you for a great go-to recipe.

Love this!  So easy and quick.  We use low-salt ketchup and serve over riced cauliflower.  1/2 tsp of the red pepper flakes is plenty for us, and we love spice.

I was kind of surprised how much my family didn't like this compared to all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe ingredients with the exception of ground red pepper verses crushed red pepper but it did not taste like Szechwan sauce to us at all.  More like shrimp in a weird ketchup sauce. Sorry won't be making this again.

I used raw shrimp and had to sub red onion for the green.  I doubled the sauce and added pineapple and that may have made it sweeter than I would have liked for a Szechwan.  I think I should have use fresh ginger as others recommended, but overall it is a good recipe and I will use it again.  It is fast and easily adaptable.

I added 3 peeled and chopped carrots which I sauteed first. After a few minutes I threw in 2 stalks of chopped celery and an entire yellow onion I had sliced. Once they were slightly soft I added garlic. I tripled the sauce but only had enough for 
2 parts of soy sauce so I added worchestire sauce for the last part. I was generous in my red pepper measurements so next time I'll be exact.  Very spicy but still delicious!

Doubled the sauce as others said and added 1 bag of frozen broccoli, 1 can of water chestnuts and 1 can of mini corn. Could have used a lb of cut of chicken too, not much protein with just the shrimp. Sauce seemed thin so didn't add the 4 Tbs of water. Forgot to reduce the ground red pepper, so added more honey to sweeten. Definitely hot. Served over jasmine rice.

An easy, very tasty  dinner tonight since I had all the ingredients on hand.  Used Minute Rice because I was out of regular long grain & I cut back on the ground red pepper; used 1/4 tsp.  Will definitely fix this again because I generally have everything in the kitchen without having to make a special trip to the store.

This is really very good! I made it as it, but doubled the sauce and added broccoli, bell pepper strips and carrots. I stir fried the extra vegetables with the onion and garlic before adding the shrimp. I stir fried the shrimp for a minute or two before adding the sauce. It was spicy, but not too spicy. Just right!

 Second time I made this I ran out of cornstarch so I made it without and it still turned out tasty.

Not my favorite dish--ketchup was too much--would cut it back next time.  I would more than likely double the recipe as it was too dry for me, but it was tasty.

This dish was very easy to make, very healthy, and very delicious. As others suggested I doubled the sauce, and I was glad I did since it was so delicious. It gave me enough to spoon over a riced cauliflower stir-fry side dish (frozen from Trader Joes). I used 1 tsp. of ginger paste instead of the ground ginger, which added some good flavor. I'm sensitive to spicy foods, so I cut the red pepper in half, but I felt like it would have been fine to increase it. It didn't end up being too spicy for me. Overall, this was a great recipe that I'll defintely make again.

I tried this tonight, and my boyfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed it. I did make a few changes, some due to personal taste (fresh broccoli florets, onion... I also added a splash more of the soy sauce), and some due to lack of ingredients on hand (I added duck sauce b/c we didn't have honey). It definitely has some heat, but it is a flavorful heat.

I made this tonight for dinner. I added vegetables to make it a meal and to use items from the fridge because I hate throwing food out. I doubled the sauce per reviews...no bad odor during cooking....I did leave the red pepper at the regular amount because I have been heavy-handed with the spicy lately. I just eyeballed the amounts because it seemed to be a forgiving recipe. The added veg were zucchini, mushrooms red onion and peas...and a bit of corn from another dish. I served it over rice and had extra chopped green onions,  toasted sunflower seeds almond slices as a garnish. It was really good! Thankyou!

I made this cooking the shrimp in olive oil,  adding garlic and green onions as well as a pound of cooked mushrooms at the last minute, then stirring in the sauce.  I tripled the sauce and doubled the other ingredients.  Quite spicey but very tasty. I served it with fresh pineapple to cut the heat of the sauce.

This recipe is so good! However, I gave it a 4 star because i felt the oil was too much, and it needed some more kinds of vegetables. Other than that, it’s delicious and I cooked it for my parent and brothers and they all loved it.

Delicious! Easy to make.  Husband made small additions, doubled the sauce ingredients, added minced ginger to sauce and in pan with garlic and onion,  including some veggies in the sauce at the end.  Not to spicey.

Absolutely delicious and quick to make. I added zucchini, broccoli and carrots and there was just the right amount of sauce to coat everything (we don’t food too saucy). I served it over cauliflower rice and it was a complete and quick meal that the family loved (without telling my children the rice was actually cauliflower). Will be a new meal for this family.

I used cooked shrimp and a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables. I doubled the sauce and added it when the veggies were nearly crisp cooked. Tossed in the shrimp just to warm them. Delicious meal with rice noodles. The ginger was just enough and the red pepper gave it a kick.

This is glop! The only changes I made were to use fresh shrimp, fresh ginger, and fresh garlic! I was naturally suspicious of a Chinese recipe that includes catsup, but thought I’d give it a try. If you have never actually eaten Chinese food prepared in San Francisco , New York City, Washington DC or China, chances are you will think this is tasty. And, if your Hubby and children think it’s good, by all means, prepare it for them... chances are they will never know the difference!

I was looking for a flavorful and healthy dinner to make with shrimp I had gotten on sale, along with a lovely assortment of vegetables. This recipe was perfect as I had all the sauce ingredients in the house.  I made the sauce the day before, allowing the flavors to blend in the fridge, and I also doubled it as I wanted a sauce for brown rice.  I didn’t have green onions, so I used a shallot, thinly sliced.  I sautéed the shallot and garlic for 2mns, then added the shrimp until they just turned pink. I removed the shrimp and started adding my assortment of cut-up veggies to the pan, heavier ones like carrots 1st, ending with sliced baby bok choy. I poured the sauce into the vegetable mixture to coat, covered the pan & brought it to a light boil. I added the shrimp back in, tossed everything about for about another minute. Served it over the brown rice with the extra sauce. I cut back on the red pepper as we don’t like things super hot, but enough to add flavor. It was a beautiful presentation, the flavors in the sauce blended so well that we put it on our salads also. Next time I make it, I will use fresh ginger. Really good recipe as is, and easy enough to add the fresh veggies as I did.

Very flavorful.  I added a bit more crushed pepper, as we like spicy. But was a wee bit too spicy. I tripled the sauce, except the water and cornstarch. Made a few changes. Used garlic chili sauce instead of the ketchup, as a lot of the reviews were not fond of the strong ketchup flavor, added a bit of fresh lime juice to the sauce. Also, because my fiance prefers it, I mixed some rice in with  the shrimp before adding the sauce.
Would definitely make this again

First time I ever made shrimp - excellent! I only used half of the red pepper that the recipe called for, but it was still too hot for my wimpy family members - but it was fine with me. I made 2 pounds of shrimp and tripled the sauce, and it worked out well. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very good recipe.  Added 5 cups of stir fry vegetables to recipe to minimize amount of rice side dish.  Tripled up on the sauce mixture to coat additional veggies.  Next time will cut back on red pepper.

This was DELICIOUS!  I doubled the sauce, which I made in a pot instead of mixing in a bowl.  I heated it on low and let it after simmer so the flavors could meld together.  I also added the cornstarch (mixed with water to make a slurry) after the sauce had simmered and stirred for about 1 minute until it had a nice consistency.  


Next I sauteed the onion and garlic in a frying pan and added that to the sauce.  I then cooked fresh shrimp in the frying pan and stirred them into the sauce.  Served it over white rice and enjoyed a fabulous dinner!

I will definitely make this again...thank you for a great recipe!

Had tiger shrimp to use up so ventured into this recipe.  Downsized it for two persons and it was just perfect.  Did add some Bok Choy for greens and served on rice.

Definately a 5 star recipe.   Will cut back on the pepper flakes.   Tends to get super hot with just a few.   It is however, quick, easy, and flavorful.

An excellent, simple recipe. At first I was hesitant to make it because it called for ketchup, which I automatically assumed would make it subpar and "inauthentic". But my wife (who is Chinese) told me many good Chinese restaurants actually use ketchup when making certain dishes like this. I used 1/2 lb. raw shrimp and slightly increased amount of each ingredient accordingly, which included TJ's ketchup (no added corn syrup), about 1/2 tsp. finely diced FRESH ginger and a little extra crushed red pepper for more flavor. My wife thought it was great and said the leftovers tasted even better when warmed up the next day for lunch. An ideal side dish is broccoli florets quickly stir-fried in minced garlic and salt.

Great flavor and easy instructions.  I was out of plain rice, so I used Uncle Ben's 90 sec butter garlic microwave.  That added some interesting flavor.  I'd definitely make it again.

I cooked everything but the shrimp and then I added the raw shrimp, that I had taken the shell and tail off. Cooked it until the shrimp was pink.  It was excellent.
I don't think precooked shrimp has good flavor for this kind of dish.. Yum-o

As usual, I doubled the sauce.the taste was good. I felt the dish could have handled a few more vegetables along with the green onions. Over all the meal was good and very easy and quick to prepare and cook.

This was just okay as written.. i didn't care for the ketchup in the sauce. It made it too tomatoey tasting. Next time I would eliminate it and maybe increase the honey a tad.  I also added some fresh veggies. I cooked them in the oil first (broccoli, sliced carrots and red pepper) then removed them and added them back in just before adding the shrimp.

I made this pretty much as written with the exception of using real ginger as other reviewers suggested. I did add broccoli to the final dish as well.  It is an outstanding sauce and I agree that it should be doubled or even tripled. It will be my go to sauce for shrimp or chicken from now on.

This was delicious. Spice was just right! I sliced and sautéed some fresh carrots before adding the shrimp and sauce which added a nice element to the dish. I also had about a pound of shrimp so doubled the sauce recipe. I found the sauce to be a little too thick so thinned it with low sodium chicken broth. Will definitely make again.

Very quick and easy to make, I realized after cooking it I had to eat it VERY, VERY slowly, because I didn’t want it to end.  DELICIOUS.  Note: I prepared the shrimp by tossing in a mix of 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp Kosher salt, letting sit for about 15 minutes, then sous vide at 137F for 30 minutes.  SUPER TENDER, plus a springy bite.

This recipe is awesome!  The only changes I made were that I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil and a thumb sized portion of fresh ginger diced ( as per another review).  
Not only is this delicious, it is very calorie friendly!  Served with 1/2 jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. YUM

I actually rate this 4 1/2 stars. I will make it again. I added the pea pods one reviewer mentioned, can’t image making it without them. The next time I make it I am going to substitute molasses for the honey.  I think this will give the sauce a little richer/deeper flavor. I will also try this with chicken. Very good, healthy recipe.  I’ll keep you posted how the changes work out.

I prefer to use raw jumbo shrimp. By cooking the shell the liquid can be added to soup stock. Raw shrimp cooks so  quickly that I’d be afraid of overcooking the cooked shrimp that this recepie calls for winiding up with a rubbery consistency. I also like to add in some vegetables like sugar snap peas, snow peas, mushrooms and broccoli to make a complete meal. Yum!

It was fine.  My wife added more honey to hers.  I will make it again.  Maybe double the sauce and add some pineapples?

I did not have green onions, so I added diagonal sliced celery. Also added about ½ cup of pineapple chunks. It had a very nice flavor for a quick meal. If you like extra sauce double the sauce recipe.

Was not a fan. Lacking in depth.  Missing something- maybe fish sauce?  I don’t know. I usually can trust the star rating on AllRecipes.  This was disappointing- will not make again.

Definitely a five star recipe! I made this using other reviewer’s comments and so glad I doubled  the sauce.  Next time I will triple it because we have no leftovers. I used half the amount of red pepper And used coconut amino acids instead of soy sauce. It is a great substitute for soy sauce and doesn’t have the sodium.  There is enough sodium in  the ketchup this doesn’t need any.

This was SO good!  I didn't have any honey so had full heat.  Next time I may add some pineapple chunks for sweetness and diced red & green pepper for color.  Definitely making again!!

Sorry, but waaaay too much cornstarch.  It got so pasty that I had to keep adding water, thus diluting the flavors.  I liked the ginger, but I use my own thinly sliced, dehydrated, dried, and pulverized ginger.

Added 10 diagonal sliced Asparagus and celery and squash. Stir fried them first if 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Put aside and followed recipe. Added 1/4 teaspoon chili paste and doubled honey. Once sauce added also added 1 cup Seafood Stock and cooked all together for a few minutes. Took off fire. Spiraled Zucchini and stir fried separate with salt/ pepper. Substituted for rice. Excellent flavors and healthy.

The honey cuts the heat for those who claim that it is too spicy. I have some ground peppers (ghost, chipotle and jalapeno) that I can add after cooking to add more heat as preferred

Any spicy dish that is called Szechwan (Sichuan) must include Sichuan peppercorns in addition to chili peppers. Sichuan peppercorn is qualitatively different than chili peppers, stimulating taste through a different kind of taste sensor.

I can't rate this because I haven't made it yet. It looks good, but I am wondering why not use raw shrimp, which cooks in minutes. Is it to save time peeling? Re-cooking shrimp may not come out well. I may give it a try with raw shrimp.

Made it just like the recipe and it was delicious.  Not too spicy, so might add a touch more red chiles next time....there will definitely be a next time as my husband and I both liked it.  Not difficult to prepare and doesn't take long from prep to table.  Served over steamed rice.

This was delicious! I doubled the sauce and added a little extra honey and soy sauce.  I used a yellow onion chopped in 1 inch pieces because I didn’t have green onions. I also added a red bell pepper, broccoli and long sliced baby carrots. I stir fried all the veggies together and then added shrimp. I only used 1/4 t of red pepper flakes because we don’t like extra hotness.  I served it over white rice. My 95 year old mother, who lives with us, voluntarily said it was really good...and that’s unusual. The sauce would also be delicious with chicken.

This was very good.  I made the whole sauce recipe with one serving of shrimp.  I served it over stir-fried zucchini and mushrooms.  The spiciness was perfect.  There was a little bit of tomato-y taste as other reviewers have said, so next time I will cut down the ketchup a little bit.

Great recipe! I agree with other reviewers! Double the sauce. I used Brown Rice - simply because we like it but would work well with any type of rice. 
I cut back on the pepper flakes! A mistake for us! We prefer the more spicy variety of this recipe!
Simply and easy to make. 
Great to serve on any occasion!!

Very good and easy. Would make more sauce next time; a little under coated.  My husband was disappointed I didn't make more.

When we made it we cut the crushed red peppers in half which was not a good idea because the red peppers really need to give it a kick. I will never do that again!

No complaints here. This recipe was delicious made exactly as described, and it couldn’t be easier or quicker! I think it would be good with broccoli or red peppers added, and maybe some peanuts or cashews.

Overall, my family thought this was good. I left the red pepper flakes out then anyone who wanted spicy sprikled their own on top of rice before spooning the shrimp onto the rice. I thought the sauce was a little bland but everyone else loved it. Served with steamed broccoli. It was extremely quick & easy so I wil make again.

I doubled the sauce and used raw shrimp as others have suggested.  This seemed to us to lack a little something.  Next time I will try adding pea pods, pineapple chunks, and water chestnuts for added flavor and crunch.

Everything was great, but I not having the red pepper flakes and  choosing to use cheyanne pepper ( 2tsp.) and man my lips are still burning and I made this yesterday. If substitutes are used make sure you use them in moderation. Grew up in Hawaii with such dishes. Ono!!

So yummy and so quick! My kind of meal for sure! I did add zucchini and yellow squash to the garlic and green onions for added veggies. Double to sauce for sure, can't go wrong. I served over cauliflower rice as we are eating low carbs. This recipe is going in my favorite recipe book right now!

Was pretty good. I seasoned the shrimp with Japanese 7 spice, which added a nice zing. Subbed coconut aminos in place of the soy sauce and finally used riced cauliflower as a side. Would add onions and bell peppers to the mix next time.

Very good dish, but way too much red pepper flakes for us. We liked the taste, but it was just too hot for us. May try again, but will reduce the pepper flakes.

This was great.  Fast, easy and tasty.  I substituted Siracchi for ketchup which made it really hot but my family likes spicy.  I served it with rice.  It was a big hit and I'll be making this again!

I made this dish according to the directions.. It was awesome!! I served it over a combination of brown, and white rice.  Next time I am going to add some pineapple. I think that would make a nice addition to the flavor.

First time around, the sauce was too sweet and tasted just of ketchup. Second time, I subbed the ketchup with tomato paste, cut back on the honey, used fresh ginger, and used less cornstarch. Awesome!!!! Defintely double the recipe!

I have done this recipe twice so far. Once with shrimps then with white fish, in both trials I added some frozen vegetables.
I cutted the white fish in chunky pieces and cooked it with the onion and garlic. Then added the frozen vegetables until they were tender before adding the mixture.
When doing the mixture I didn't have corn starch so I used regular flour. Then discovered that I've ran out of honey, so I used regular white sugar.
Even with all those changes, the final dish was a big hit in our house.
Will definitely cook it when the craving for a spicy Chinese recipe is asked for.

I had to make a few changes for a diabetic diner who also has HBP, so I left out the ketchup and reduced the amount of soy sauce. Swapped the pepper flakes for a little black pepper to cut back on the heat.

This was amazingly good!  I sauteed sliced onions and carrots in canola oil for about 5 minutes.  I added minced garlic, bean sprouts, sliced portobello mushrooms, and cauliflower rice and stir fried for about 3 minutes before adding in shrimp and sauce.  Cooked an additional 7 minutes stirring frequently until shrimp was cooked thoroughly.  I did not have green onions or ketchup,  I substituted tomato sauce for ketchup and added a little sugar and corn syrup (about a 1/4 teaspoon each).  I doubled the sauce as recommended and used only half of the red pepper.  I love spicy but was being considerate of others.  I found it to have plenty of heat.  I didn't want to stop eating it and can hardly wait to eat the leftovers today.  I will make this over and over again for sure!  Great recipe!

Great recipe! Sorry all you purists but I did make some changes and it became 5 stars!! I doubled the sauce and added cooked broccoli, and sautéed red pepper with the green onions. Also served with peanuts and extra red pepper flakes to shake on the top. It was like a Governors Shrimp which is our favorite from a nearby restaurant. Highly recommend with or without the changes.

Made this tonight. Liked it overall. Good amount of heat. I gave it four stars because I went off previous reviews and doubled the sauce and think that was just right. Also I think there is to much ketchup in it and leaves an aftertaste.

It's different than most shrimp recipes in that it doesn't call for any lemon rind or juice. We mixed in Ramen as it finished cooking. The two complimented each other nicely.

Great recipe, a little to spicy for me but my husband loved it. I did double the sauce as we like to have it over yellow rice or Spanish rice from Goya. Just a little more flavor then white rice. Definitely will make again

Nothing is ever 100%
Add jerk seasoning the second time.

Great recipe!  I doubled the sauce (per everyone's instructions) and used some substitutions.  I didn't want to cook with ketchup so replaced with tomato paste, used fresh raw shrimp instead of precooked, and used fresh ginger.  After cooking the shrimp in the garlic and green onion for a minute or so I added fresh stir fry vegetables and cooked a few more minutes until the shrimp was done.  Then added the sauce and some snow peas.  I served over Jasmine rice.  Family loved including my 10 year old daughter who normally doesn't like spicy dishes.

This was a delicious, quick, and simple meal. I used fresh ginger as I had read in another persons review and it gave it wonderful flavor. Fresh is always better, if available! My husband and I really enjoyed this. I will definitely make it again.

I will be making this again. I changed the recipe by adding spiraling carrot and sliced onion and mushrooms used 1/4tea. Channel pepper instead of pepper flakes. Was at the high end of hot, will use less next time and might use chicken or Pork to save money. Very pretty presentation .

I bought 1 1/2 pounds of large raw shrimp for my family, double the sauce (as I read in previous reviews, glad I did).  I blanched and sautéed some broccoli before I started, then added the shrimp to the pan, half way thru cooking I added the sautéed broccoli and sauce and garlic ( fearing the broccoli would scorch if added in the beginning) and garnished with the sliced scallions.  This is absolutely going on the "make again list". I served it with basmati rice.  It's a keeper!

Perfectly delicious.  I made it exactly the way it states and its a recipe we come back to often when shrimp is on sale.  I make a double batch (with a triple amount of shrimp) and there are no left overs in my house!!

Loved this very easy recipe.... I tweaked it a bit to make it more of a full entree by adding (1) Green Pepper and (1/2) large onion both cubed.  Add it in with the green onions to give a chance to soften a bit.  Next time will add small can of bamboo shoots as well.  And as far as the 'heat' not very hot - dont have to add the pepper flakes, but i actually put a little more in - tweak as you want depending on taste

Yummy! Quick and easy for me to whip up during the week after work and my kids will eat everything on their plates to get seconds. Has earned a spot on my weekly dinner rotations. The only thing I do is double the sauce because I usually serve over rice.

Our family really enjoyed this quick and easy recipe!  We didn't have red pepper flakes so we used just a few chili pepper flakes (we also aren't big spice people) and the heat was just perfect.

I followed the recipe as written. The only change I would make is to use less crushed red pepper. It was a little too hot for me. Will definitely make again.

Definitely a keeper.  I made double the sauce.  My hubby doesn't like white rice so I used yellow rice and added some frozen peas to the rice before it was completely out of water.  The yellow rice and little green peas added color to the dish. A very easy, tasty meal.   I would serve to company any time.

Made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great. I added fresh veggies so I doubled the sauce and served over rice. Super easy with plenty of flavor. Will definitely put this in the regular rotation . My 20 month old daughter loved it too. Not too spicy.

Unimpressed, but it was fast. I wanted more vegetables, so I added fresh broccoli and snap peas. Used fresh ginger, but it was just so so.

Stir Fried store bought chopped stir-fry vegetables in a large pot. Cooked 1 Lb. cleaned shrimp seasoned with some fresh ground pepper, Old Bay spice, and chopped garlic in a separate pan as to not overcook the shrimp.Once the veggies where crisp-cooked I added the sauce. Mixed in shrimp and served over Spanish Rice,  which went with this perfectly. Try it.  Garnished with some Honey Glaze Pecan pieces which took it over the top!

I put fresh ginger in it.  As suggested by someone else, I reserved 1/4 c of the sauce.  After the shrimp was mostly cooked, I added 2 c of brown rice and the 1/4 cup of reserved sauce and mixed well.  It was delicious and the spicing was just perfect.  Not to hot at all.

The flavor of ketchup seemed to overpower the sauce so if I did try this again, I would omit it, and instead add some rice wine vinegar, and perhaps tomato paste.  Also, it is very sweet so I would halve the amount of honey or none at all.  Edible, but only because I added a lot of shrimp and vegetables.

Very. Unimpressed...  I guess it's really my fault., I cook Asian frequently but thought maybe using ketchup would give this recipe a different twist. Wrong. Too simple and no imagination. I used fresh ginger of course and doubled the sauce.  The result was boring.

The family loved it!  It has lots of tasty flavor, great fast meal with steamed rice!  I doubled the recipe and went skimpy on the corn starch, so not to have the recipe too thick. Also used fresh ginger, finely  grated.Delicious!!

Note this isn't a recipe for small children or others with a tongue that can't handle heat. I'd cut back on the red pepper quite a bit if you want to achieve that. For me, however, the recipes worked perfectly as is. As others suggested I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and it's worth noting that this great sauce can be made well in advance. Can also add sugar snap peas at the end.

I make lots of recipes from this site. This is the first one I've ever rated. Loved it! Hubby did too. He couldn't rave enough over it! We followed the sauce recipe exactly, with one tiny exception to the sauce. We added a tiny dash of Sriracha sauce (I do mean tiny, a little goes a long ways). We like it pretty spicy around here. We doubled the batch of sauce, cooking the shrimp without peeling or deveining. Added them to the sauce when perfectly pink. The sauce thickens very quickly, so we had it ready to go. We just ate the shrimp and sauce. If you want to add veggies and rice or noodles, I would recommend tripling or quadrupling the sauce. This would be good with both. I also think it would go well with chicken or pork. Great recipe! Delicious, and very adaptable. Thanks for sharing.

Taste wise I would give this a five. My issue however is that there wasn't nearly enough sauce to evenly coat the shrimp, so I wound up having to double it. Otherwise it's a great recipe, though next time I'll probably add a bit more spice. It just wasn't hot enough for me, but that's more personal preference, and has nothing to do with the person who posted this delicious recipe. Adding this to the"keep" list.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this recipe, and have made at least once a month for the past few years. The only differences I make are to use chicken instead of shrimp, quadruple the sauce, throw in some frozen broccoli or sugar snap peas, and sometimes throw some chopped peanuts on top.

Definitely one of our favorite meals!

Try #2. Outstanding recipe. Thank you! My tweaks are: (1) replace about a quarter of the oil with toasted sesame oil, (2) at least double the quantity of sauce, (3) after the sauce has simmered and thickened, then throw in the shrimp for a couple of minutes at the end, (4) sprinkle with some black sesame seeds for presentation. This pairs really well with the Costco frozen stir fry vegetables. See my pic.

This was really really good. I think next time. I will simmer the sauce first then toss the shrimp in it. I also added a bag  of stir fry veggies. Fast and easy. Thanks for the recipe!

Great and easy recipe, I made this because I had all the ingredients at home... I had a 16 oz bag of key west frozen pinks, that I defrosted in cold water, peeled and deveined before starting. I doubled all aspects of the sauce recipe, and cut back on the ginger paste I used because we aren't huge fans of ginger. Overall delicious, my boyfriend ate thirds, we served with haricot vert green beans steamed and basmati rice on the side. Five stars for sure.

The sauce is a cinch to make and can easily be prepared ahead of time and put in the refrigerator for future use. My only recommendation is to double the recipe b/c it's that good! I served over linguine and it was delightful.

This is a fantastic,easy and quick recipe to pull together.  Each time I've made it I've tripled the ingredients.  I use large chucks of white onion, broccoli and chicken or shrimp served over white rice.  Either way, its delicious.  When in a pinch, I've omitted the green onion garnish; however it does add a nice flavor if available.  Now that I think of it, adding pineapple chucks wouldn't be a bad touch. 
This has become one of my frequent go to dishes because of the quick cooking time and easy ingredients.   It wont disappoint.

This is quite good.  It throws together quickly and uses ingredients you already have on hand.  I added some strips of fresh red, yellow and orange peppers along with the green onion.  I sauteed those until crisp tender then added the garlic for 30 seconds before tossing in the fresh shrimp.  I added the sauce (which I doubled) and it only took a few minutes until the sauce was bubbling and thick.  I served this over lo mein noodles where the extra sauce came in handy.  We like the heat so the red pepper amount worked for us. The peppers were a great addition and I wish that I had added some other veggies as well to round out the dish a bit more.  Easy, fast, and yummy!

Yeah the ketchup seemed weird at first, but it worked! I added two packets of the Trader Joe's "Handful of cashews" ( about 1/2 cup) for a little crunch and a bit more protein.  It satisfied my craving for Chinese food.  I will definitely be having this dish again.  Thank you!

This was certainly easy but I wasn't very impressed with the flavor of the sauce. It was kind of bland, even with all of that red pepper in there. I will look for a more authentic recipe.

This was great! I doubled the sauce like suggestions said and glad I did. I also added one red bell pepper. Changes I will make next time: will use fresh ginger, will add fresh jalapeños and add snow peas. We served this with white rice. We also used one pound of shrimp. Amazing!

I thought it was quick and delicious! Very easy to make. One note if using frozen shrimp either dethaw prior to cooking or in the pan and dispose of the water. I put my shrimp in a bowl, drained the water and proceeded with the garlic and green onion. Came out excellently! Kids ate it so that means a lot

Delicious. Made exactly as written except I don't make it spicy so skip the pepper flakes. I doubled the sauce because we like extra for our rice. My whole family loves this.

This is a new family favorite! My 7 year old son loved it and had seconds! I substituted the green onion for mushrooms and made a double batch of sauce. Such an easy and flavorful recipe, can't wait to make this again and add more veggies with the shrimp!

I've made this several times. The sauce, which is the basis of this recipe is excellent and a great foundation for any stir-fry. I make sauce just as the recipe calls for. It's very flavorful and has quite a kick. (I'd cut down on the red pepper if you don't like spicy.) I always make the sauce first then stir-fry raw shrimp and whatever vegetables  I'm feeling and add the sauce at the end. It's a fast healthy meal. If you add veggies, I'd definitely double the sauce. I do and it's perfect amount  to serve over rice.

Best recipe for a "home version" of Chinese food I've made from allrecipes. A bit spicy for my tastes, but my husband loved it. I added water chestnuts and a broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot vegetable mix to the recipe, so I then doubled the sauce too. It worked out well with enough sauce, but not soupy. I will recommend this to anyone!

This was excellent! I did as some reviewers and doubled the sauce to allow for stir fry veggies, and used fresh ginger instead of dry seasoning. Never been a ginger fan, thinking of the pickled ginger with sushi, but this was excellent. Also sprinkled some sesame seeds and green onion on it once it was done and paired with some frozen chicken fried rice from Trader Joes and frozen egg rolls from the market. Just had a fortune cookie from prior night's takeout to complete the dish. But was a simple and fun dish to create. Thank you!!

Yummy! I loved how easy it was. I used a pound of raw shrimp and doubled the sauce. I increased the red pepper flakes to 1 tablespoon, but it was barely spicy. Next time I will increase the red pepper flakes to 2 or 3 tablespoons and see if I can taste the heat. We love spicy!

This is delicious! It wasn't quite hot enough for my taste, so I added 1tbsp of chili oil to the sauce. Yum!

I will make this again! My only changes were adding broccoli and tripled the sauce. It was enough to serve 4 with a little extra.

I've made this recipe twice now, and each time my wife and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. The only changes I have made to it include: processed steel oats in place of the cornstarch, and Sriracha in place of the ketchup. The added spice makes this exceptional dish a little warmer.

This was a great and simple recipe.  Our family loved it.  I substituted fresh ginger (about 2 tables spoons) for the ginger power and cooked it with the garlic.    
Also, I added a little bit of pineapple juice (about 3 tablespoons) to give it a little something.  I think this made a big difference.  
I cooked the onion, ginger and garlic mixture for a little longer than was indicated in the recipe - about 2 minutes instead of 30 seconds.

This was great.  I wanted to do something simple and quick for large red shrimp.  I did put the shrimp in the marinade for about 30 minutes as I prepared the rest of the meal.  Then I added to the the  sauted onions and garlic. I thought the sauce seasoning was perfect.  However a little thick.  Thus  the shrimp started to stick - to saute pan as I stirfried.  Added about 1/3 chicken broth.  Next time I will try increasing the sauce ingrediants but leave the cornstarch the same.  Should have made broth out of shrimp shells and subsituted for the water.  Served over rice with asparagus.

Yum! Added corn starch coated cubes of chicken thighs (about 3 lbs), fried beforehand, frozen broccoli 1/2 big bag, steamed beforehand, and 1 chopped onion and 1 green pepper- stir fried beforehand- then heated sauce and raw shrimp for about 4 minutes.  Put a scoop of jasmine rice, then a scoop of chicken, then vegetables, then sauce and shrimp- Super good- tasted like Dragon and Phoenix- really great- just took longer than 20 minutes due to the addition of cubed chicken thighs (had to cook in 4 rounds in a skillet)  and vegetables. Took about an hour total- Fantastic weekend dish! will definitely make again and again! I also added a little more soy sauce and doubled the sauce- it was just right!
2nd Review- just found out as I was preparing this dish that my husband ate the bag of shrimp we had in the freezer so here come the modifications :) I am using a bag of calamari and flaked fake crab meat instead of the shrimp. Tripled the sauce and also added a large head of chopped bok choy, a can of sliced water chestnuts and a can of sliced bamboo shoots. Also added half of the amount of fresh grated ginger and the other half powdered ginger. Serving over Jasmine Rice. I wish I had some fresh mushrooms to slice and add to this dish! Still Super!

I made this as directed, except I used raw shrimp instead of pre-cooked. The dish was quick and easy to make but the flavors were a little bland. I probably won't use this again without making changes.

The only change I made was to reduce the crushed red pepper because we do not like hot.  I cooked sliced carrots, sliced celery  and, peas with 8 oz of Fido Spaghetti.  I added this to the Szechwan shrimp.  No left overs.

Not sure if I would make this again. I added broccoli, mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion. As suggested, I used raw, tail-on shrimp. I disliked the consistency of the sauce - almost sticky like a glaze, instead of saucy, I assume because of the ketchup? The sauce thickens up very quickly because of the cornstarch. If I make it again, I might find a substitute for some or all of the ketchup - possibly some chile paste. I served it over wheat noodles. Ok recipe but needs some tweaks.

This was an OK "spicy shrimp" recipe but it didn't taste at all like the szechwan shrimp I've had at restaurants...it just tasted a lot like something made with ketchup to us.  We probably won't make it again.

Good, easy and fast! I really liked this recipe, but found it just a bit too sweet. I added some Sriracha sauce when I plated it, and it helped tame the sweetness. The only change I made was to use fresh ginger since I had it on hand. Will definitely make this again and maybe cut back on the honey.

Definitely double the sauce and add more shrimp! It's so delicious, you'll eat a lot and wish you had more! I just left some plain shrimp out for my kids and then added the sauce to the rest. For my kids, I just squirted some lemon on plain shrimp and they love it.

I tripled the wet ingredients and added vegetables.  It was delicious!  I didn't find this recipe too spicy.  It was just right. I will make this again.

Excellent recipe!!!I quadruple the ingredients so that I can have leftovers for the following day. Also, I use fresh peeled shrimp & sauté it with the green onions, oil & green onions until they turn pink.  I serve it over rice & add (thawed) frozen broccoli florets & let simmer for about 10 minutes.

I tried this recipe twice now and I found that the ketchup/soy sauce ratio to be odd. I switched the 1:2 ratio in favour of the soy sauce and I also used fresh ginger (why use dried?)

It seemed on the sweet side if you add the amount of ketchup suggested.

This is a popular one with my family. I tripled the sauce recipe, added rice and stir fry veggies, and I cut down on the pepper. It does add a spicy kick if you use the amount of pepper listed. I would definitely advise making double or triple for the sauce. One of the best dinners I have found on this site so far!!

My husband and I made this dish just this evening and it was just delicious! We used a whole pound of cooked shrimp as that's what we had on hand. Didn't have the crushed red pepper so we used a 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper instead. Kept everything else the same. We put it over instant brown rice and let me tell you - this tasted fabulous! It was so fast and easy to make. This will definitely be on our regular monthly menu. Thanks, FOODGU1!

So, now I know how my favorite Asian food spot gets such fresh food out to me so fast!  This was my first Asian meal, and I couldn't be happier.  It locks up two of my top priorities with a recipe, ease and taste.  Bonus priority being pretty healthy to boot.  I thought with how easy it was, it would have to be bland.  Nope.  Good, thick, tasty sauce.  All you need is some regular white rice to top this with, and you're set.  Got one of those steamer bags of edamame, and I had a meal that looked and tasted like I spent a lot of time to prepare.

I made this recipe yesterday for my family. They all loved it. It was so fast and easy. I added a bag of thawed stir fry veggies. With the addition of 10 minute rice, can't get much easier than this!

Really delicious simple recipe.  I used raw shrimp and just cooked until opaque before adding sauce.  I also cooked a bag of stir fry frozen vegetables in the microwave beforehand and tossed it in with the sauce.  I tripled the sauce and had plenty for serving with brown rice (and we like sauce).  However, I only doubled the red pepper and it was still very spicy.  I like heat, but others in my family thought it was too spicy and couldn't eat it - next time I will probably triple the sauce again but keep the pepper to 1/2 tsp.

Super great! Have made several times. I doubled the sauce to add a little more thickness. Also have added various other veggies including red pepper, orange pepper, onion, spinach. Also added a little teriyaki sauce in addition to soy sauce. Such good flavor, easy and so healthy! Thanks!

So fast, so easy, and so delicious.  My husband said "keep that recipe" and I even forgot to add the green onions!  I used uncooked shrimp and a head of broccoli.  Put the broccoli in first and shrimp in last before the adding the sauce, which MUST be doubled to have enough.

Really really disappointing. Love all the ingredients (except for ketchup--with Chinese??  And vegetable oil is also a no-no, used peanut oil, as is normal, with Chinese. Should have taken these mistakes as a warning sign!!!) Other than those two (accepted the ketchup with doubts, corrected the oil) I meticulously followed the recipe (well, it IS hugely well-rated!!) This was a deeply disappointing set of non-flavours.

It was good and others liked it. But seemed like a flavor was lacking or missing. Will be making it again and tweaking it. Worth a try.

I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it had potiental, however, my sauce was really really salty. I think it could have been my mistake of adding too much soy sauce. I will defiantly try this again and see how it turns out.

I  prepared this recipe with sticky rice.  The szechuan sauce was OK. It was missing something though. Perhaps a little lime juice and more garlic. Also,  I used ginger powder but will opt for the fresh stuff next time. Not a bad dish and it was quick and easy to make but,  a store bought sauce could have easily achieved the same effect.

This recipe is so tasty and easy to make with ingredients most of us have on hand.  After making it several times in a month I started to make the sauce in a pint size mason jar and changing the servings to 16.  I'll use half the sauce for one meal and the other half gets used within a day or two for another meal.  The sauce goes equally well with chicken or just a mix of veggies.  I usually increase the red pepper and add fresh ginger if I have it on hand.  We like it spicy!

We loved this recipe I did triple the sauce and add steamed broccoli and carrots that I steamed ahead of time I also added bok Choy while cooking the shrimp then added the broccoli and carrots and sauce at the same time!! I used fresh minced ginger but found it to be too strong for my liking!!! Overall very good!

This dish was fantastic! I doubled the sauce and added some frozen stir fry veggies. I also took the advice of others and used uncooked shrimp and it turned out PERFECT! Next time I may try chicken or beef!

Very happy with this dish.  I used about a tbls of fresh ginger instead of powder.  Also used fresh shrimp instead of cooked.  I just cooked them in the Olive Oil with the onions, garlic and ginger till translucent.  Also added some frozen veggies.

Great recipe.  I doubled the sauce but not the crushed red pepper (I used 3/4 tsp).  It was plenty spicy.  I also added about 1/4 tsp of brown sugar.  I liked the added flavor.

Love this recipe. Very simple and flavorful. I did add a diced onion and one diced red pepper for a bit of crunch, color and added sweetness. Will be making it again. I did do as someone suggested and doubled the sauce...well worth it.
Thanks for sharing!

Thank you for sharing this great recipe.  My family loved it. I changed the servings to 12 for six people and did not have any leftovers.  Easy and versatile sauce. Can add any protein or vegetable. I added some snow peas and broccoli and used fresh ginger.  I also added chicken as some do not like shrimp in my family.

I am not a good cook and my sauce was too thick, but my son loved it (a miracle)and I loved it! I used half of the crushed pepper because we don't regularly have spicy foods. I plan on making this quick easy meal a staple in our home. I think I will try to double or triple the sauce since it's so tasty!

I made a double batch of the sauce last week and made this twice.  There was fresh ginger in the freezer so I used that, cut the red pepper in half, and added a bit more honey as I was craving a sweeter sauce.  The first night it was good, but I felt it was missing something.  Two nights later the sauce was absolutely delicious!  The flavors really melded and it was so much more flavorful.  It is so easy that it will be a regular shrimp go to recipe!

Very quick & easy to prepare. My husband liked this a lot more than I did. He would have given it 5 stars. I will be making this again with a few changes. I did use fresh shrimp, steamed broccoli and doubled the sauce. Next time I will add half of the sauce to get a good glaze on the shrimp, then add the remaining sauce. I also cheated a little with the rice and use Uncle Ben's rice in the bag that only took 90 seconds in the microwave. Now that's a fast and tasty dinner.

Great!  Double the sauce, use fresh ginger (saute it with the garlic and scallions) and use uncooked shrimp.

Have used this with both shrimp and chicken. I tend to double up on the recipe with chicken because of the juices. Always get rave reviews from the husband for this recipe, especially since it's hot enough to appease him but not so hot that I can't eat it as well. :)

I made this exactly as the recipe was written but just doubled the sauce as others suggested. Even doubling the sauce didn't give enough sauce and what sauce we did have was bland, bland, bland. I would add some OJ or something of that sort to make it a bit more flavorful next time...if there is a next time.

I bought some huge shrimp, maybe they were prawns
They were cooked, but I had to shell them.
It  wasn't as hard as I expected.
 WOW!  Was it worth it.  I used a tad less of the pepper flakes because my wife was afraid it would be too spicy.  I think either way it would be fine.  What delicious flavor.
My wife and I both felt the shrimp were just fantastic.
Just salad on the side and we had a nice meal.

Great dish!! We added some minced garlic to the oil, then sautéed fresh broccoli and slivers of carrots before adding the shrimp. We doubled the sauce like some recommended plus a pinch of cayenne. We like it spicy! Served it over a bed of white rice with egg rolls. We will defiantly make this again.

Easy, excellent tasty!  Made a small amount to try it out.  I used 9 shrimp, 1 cup of frozen Asian stir fry vegetables.  My husband is not a fan of ginger so I omitted that.  I used 1 tsp. of minced garlic. There was a lot of sauce to my delight. My husband is quite fussy but he really liked this!!  Think I may try adding scallops another time! Yummy!!  This is a must try recipe!!!  Enjoy!!!

Does anyone know if the honey is truly needed for this recipe?  Or can anyone suggest a healthier, lower carb substitute?

Easy to make, I doubled the sauce and used about a half a cup to sauté the veggies before adding the shrimp and the remaining sauce.  For veggies, I used green onions, pea pods, and baby carrots cut lengthwise.   Very tasty with just the right amount of heat.   I also stirred in one pack of shirataki pasta so it had a little pad Thai feel to it!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I like spicy food but besides being spicy I didn't think it had any taste at all.  I followed the recipe exactly except didn't add as much red pepper just so I didn't make it too hot.  I don't recommend it at all!

Made this last night. After reading the reviews, used chili sauce instead of Ketchup and fresh ginger. Used fresh shrimp. Cooked the shrimp with the onions and garlic, then added the sauce. Also, doubled the sauce. Served over rice. Was very good and will make again.

I almost didn't make this because I wasn't too sure about the  combination of ingredients for the sauce, but I am soooooo glad I decided to go ahead and try it! This was absolutely awesome!!! I want to try this with chicken next. I will definitely make this again and again!!!

A lovely quick recipe, with not too many ingredients. You could add a stir fry mix, or other steamed vegetables or use pork or chicken fillets. 
I served it with chinese noodles

Delicious. Figured the sauce recipe usually aren't enough, and we had almost twice the shrimp so we tripled (and a dash more) the ingredients, added a few shakes of K-salt...next time less red pepper, maybe just a light teaspoon...

I made this tonight and thought it was just okay, not great. I used raw shrimp, which I think is the way to go because they were tender and juicy. The sauce tasted like it needed something else added, and I think next time I'll add some orange marmalade. My husband agreed that might be a good addition. The shrimp, which I served over rice, was good enough to try this again since it's such an easy recipe.

I was a bit leary of the ingredients (ketchup + honey?) and was hoping this was not going to be a sweet and sour type sauce.   It's not!  It's a nice mildly spicy sauce with a little kick that you can up or down to your liking.    I prefer more green onions, so next time I will double that.   Great overall lowfat dish that uses ingredients you always have lying around.

This recipe was delicious!  I was glad I read the reviews to double the sauce because it definitely needed it.  My boyfriend doesn't like ginger (and we didn't have any) so we omitted that and I am weak when it comes to spicy so we didn't double the red pepper and it was still very flavorful (although he added hot sauce to his)!  We added snap peas, bean sprouts, a can of water chestnuts and a can of baby corn and served it over brown rice.  Next time with all of the added veggies I will probably triple the sauce but all in all this was a great, healthy dinner!

Just a little too ketchup-y for us.  Reduce that; maybe add a little asian chile sauce instead?  Everything else was great.  We used it on shrimp and tossed in some chicken breast meat, diced, that we needed to use.  Worked great.

Delish, easy to make and low calorie!  I followed the sauce exactly as recommended except for substituting lite soy sauce.  I added cut up asparagus.  With adding a veggie, I would 1.5X the sauce next time.  I used small shrimp.  Served over jasmine 90 second (Uncle Ben's) rice and it was very filling! Only 175 calories per serving if you sub lite soy sauce and add asparagus (+210 for a serving of the rice)!

I doubled the amount of shrimp so I made 4 times the amount of sauce per other reviews. I used just over 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper for the entire amount of sauce. Thank goodness because that was just the right amount of hot and my son loves spicy. Unfortunately, my husband was not a fan of this recipe. So, start with a little pepper and add to your taste. It does not take much for this recipe.

I tried this tonight for dinner and it was the BOMB!!!  I followed the recipe for the liquid, doubled it as others suggested due to the veggie additions - sliced carrots, a whole bunch of green onions and pea pods.  Served it with rice and OMG!!!  This is going into the rotation when I feel like shrimp.

In the 5yrs I've been using this site I have reviewed a recipe maybe three times. I had to review this though because it was so good & quick & easy. Can't go wrong with that! I doubled the sauce & only used a little bit of red pepper because I don't like spicy food that much

I tripled this recipe and served it over brown rice.  I also added a can of drained pineapple chunks and used minced ginger.  It was delicious if a bit spicy and we like our food hot.

Typically, I love the 4.5-5 star recipes on this site.  But, this one did not do it for me (or my husband who eats anything).  It was one-note, and after a while, that note wasn't the best.

I doubled the sauce as others suggested and I also added scallops otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was not too spicy and DELICIOUS.  I also cooked some vegetable fried rice which balanced the dish.  I would definitely cook this again but I might have to cook a separate pot just for my 5 year old who doesn't like spicy food.  Thanks for your suggestions

This recipe is wonderful.  I can't believe how tasty it came out using simple kitchen ingredients.  I doubled the sauce amount as suggested by others and served it over brown rice.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

Easy and yummy.  I had fresh ginger on hand and added it at the wrong time.  This left me with firm ginger pieces.  It was good nonetheless.  If using fresh ginger add it with the onions and garlic.  Thanks for sharing

I was a little depressed with this recipe. It tasted good but I was looking for a bit more flavor. I suggest adding more spices than what this recipe calls for.

Made this last night...my family loved it.  They like spicy food, so it was perfect, otherwise you may want to cut back on the red pepper... Also, I'd read in another review to try using raw peeled shrimp instead of already boiled shrimp... good idea... I did just that.  Only took about 2 minutes to cook them, and I had no problem with them turning out rubbery from being cooked twice.  Also, I used about twice as much shrimp sa the recipe called for just because I had that much... It was fine.  Don't need to double the recipe or anything else.

These were quite good but not spicy at all - and I doubled the red pepper flakes. I used raw shrimp but other than that I made as written and served over rice for a simple meal.

This is very tasty.  Reminds me of Pf Changs. I did use fresh chopped ginger instead and put the shrimp in last as to not overcook them.  I also just put the container of red peppers on the table so each person could use only as much as they wanted.

I give the recipe 4 stars as written here but 5 stars as I made it.  As mentioned in many of the reviews I made a few modifications.  I just can't help myself.  I added one small zucchini and one small yellow squash (both chopped medium) to the garlic and green onions to saute.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added some Mongolian Hot Oil to the sauce and the shrimp veggie mixture ( while cooking).  Served over Basmati rice this was a complete hit.  As one user already expressed this was the best Asian dish I have EVER made at home.   Will adapt to chicken and maybe even beef.

I substituted the starch for flour and used sesame ginger instead of the ground ginger and the recipe came out perfect. Served atop of brown rice and a healthy-ish meal prepared in a short amount of time.

I agree with an earlier reviewer. Much too spicy. We ended up rinisng them in a collander to de-heat them.  If you like heat go for it.

This was an easy, quick nice dinner over rice. It was a bit heavy on the garlic (or it was my measuring) and I think I would saute the garlic before adding the green onions. As usual for our taste, I cut back on the red pepper. I'll definitely make this again, maybe doubling the amount of sauce.

Wow! EASY and delicious. I used angel hair pasta, fresh ginger, and added snow peas because I had them on hand. I'm an average cook and am always looking for quick fool proof recipes. After reading reviews, I doubled the sauce, I used flour instead of corn starch because I didn't have any - it turned out great. Made the sauce the night before, so it only took a few minutes to whip this up. A perfect recipe when you don't get home til 6pm.

This was really simple to pull together and so delicious.  I think next time I will use fresh ginger root rather than dry ginger for a more authentic taste.

This was amazing! It was simple and so easy I couldn't believe the meal that I had created:) This was the first time I had ever cooked shrimp and gone the Asian route and it came out perfect! I am doubling up on the portions next time because my boyfriend and I wanted seconds, but there was not enough:(

My husband emailed me that the leftovers that he has for lunch are "OMG - these are da BOMB!"  So this is easy and a hit.  I added snow peas to the shrimp at the end and it lended a nice crunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic! I added some veggies to mine (red and yellow peppers, mushrooms and onions) so I doubled the sauce as recommended by others.  They sauce was perfect, nice and spicy with actual flavor not just completely overpowered by the spice.  I am very happy with this recipe and with definitely be making it again!

I fixed this recipe, as written, last night. With all the ingredients and so many high ratings, I thought it would be delicious and full of flavor. I was very disappointed that it wasn't. This is a very bland sauce that the shrimp are in. If you do want to make it and doctor it up, you will want to double the sauce. There was only enough to basically coat the shrimp. None to spread on our rice.
I like to make a posted recipe and be satisfied with the flavor, as it is written.

This recipe is a winner. Big time. For the record, I doubled the sauce and used it for only two servings, and it was the perfect amount and perfect taste. As far as the rest of it, I tried to simplify things for myself as much as possible. I used pre-cooked but fresh cocktail shrimp, pre-cut green onions, pre-minced garlic and added microwave-steamed peas and carrots. The one thing that took the longest is the rice, and if I'd had the forethought to buy instanct rice, I would've done that too. Bravo, foodgu1, a fast and seriously delicious recipe.

Loved this dish. I did tweak it a bit. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the sauce mixture and I used real ginger instead of ground ginger. I added one clove of garlic, cayenne pepper and a bit of sriracha sauce because I like things SPICY! I of course used raw shrimp.....it always tastes so much better than precooked shrimp. I also added in some snow peas for some green color. Turned out wonderful! My boyfriend was complaining that there wasn't any more for seconds so I may have to make more next time!

I strongly reccomend either pre-cooking the starch before you mix all the ingredients to make it sweeter and less mealy. Cooking it longer when its all put together lends itself to scorching. Very good all the way around.

This was not quite as tasty has I had hoped...but still good. The best thing is that it was easy and quick to make. I used jumbo sized uncooked shrimp. Served on a bed of white rice. Mixed in broccoli that had already been steamed in microwave and also steamed sugar snap peas to boost up the veggies. It is worth a try. If you like really spicy, bump up the red pepper amount.

5 stars for simplicity, cooktime, ingredients and above all - taste.  I didn't have soy sauce but Dale's Steak Seasoning was a good substitute.  Don't be afraid to add some more pepper flakes.

There was not one itty bitty piece of shrimp or brown rice noodle left.  A sign from the food gods that this was a big hit.  Family raved about it!
I will use less cornstarch next time.  The sauce had to be thinned quite a bit.  Otherwise fabulous.

This was absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe for the sauce like others advised.  I added thinly sliced red, green, yellow peppers and red onion.  I served this over couscous but would be great with sticky rice.  I would definately make this again, my husband was quite impressed!!

This was decent but not 5 star, in my eyes. I enjoyed the fresh green onion with it and the sauce was tangy and sweet - but maybe a bit too sweet for a main dish.

I made this with my fiance we followed the directions to a t and got really good ingredients but it came out horribly! I should have known since the ingredient list sounded really strange to me but I wanted to believe all the amazing reviews.

After reading all the positive reviews I almost feel bad only giving this 3 stars.  The sauce was gummy, although delicious.  The shrimp seemed rather bland even with the full amount of peppers.  Perhaps a marinade would help.  The dish is extremely quick to make and very low fat.

This was so delicious!  My husband does not eat any seafood/fish, so I ate this great meal and he had a cheeseburger.  :-)  He said that it smelled so good, so I'm going to try the sauce on chicken for him.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This recipe certainly is simple and quick to make, and my family enjoyed it.  I substituted fresh grated ginger for the ground ginger, and ignored the advice to double the sauce. I am completely baffled by the notion that this sauce needs to be doubled. There was plenty of sweet and spicy sticky sauce to go around. I did use the cooked frozen shrimp, and while that was tremendously easy, next time I will take the extra couple of minutes to use uncooked shrimp and cook it myself.  I think the end result would be better.

Great recipe.  I had a little over a pound of raw shrimp I cooked in oil first, then I added broccoli, carrots and large pieces of onion to the garlic and green onion noted in the recipe .  I also mixed in a bit of Sriracha to the sauce mix to kick up the heat a little.  Going to add a bit more next time as we like our food spicy.  Will definitely be making this again.

Quite tasty and really easy to make. I replaced red pepper with black and ginger with fresh lemon and still came out nicely. Would prefer a bit sweeter, so I'll add more honey next time.

This was really easy and quick to make.  Yummy too, but if you like it spicy, add more red pepper flakes.  It needed something more, so I added snap peas along with the shrimp.  I also drizzled more soy sauce over it.

Not quite what I was expecting. I doubled the sauce and that was a mistake - because I was expecting something lighter. The basics are fine - so I'll experiment. Maybe fresh ginger, more pepper and less cornstarch.

My husband really liked this recipe. I used a 10 oz. pkg of frozen deveined, tailless medium shrimp and about 6 oz of frozen sea scallops. Because I added a package of stir-fry vegetables I doubled the sauce. This came together really quickly and tasted great over white rice. Will definitely make this one again.

This is soooo good!  My husband even said this would be fantastic on chicken or in a steak stirfry.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I tripled it.  I think that's essential.  It has a kick, but definitely not to hot.

WOW! I don't get "wow'd" by most Asian recipes that call for such simple ingredients. This is the exception!

I did make the following changes: tripled sauce, used jarred minced ginger, and added about 3 TB jarred sliced lemon grass, and used a mixture of canola oil and sesame oil. 

Like the author says - don't let the simple ingredients fool you! This is SO worth it and SO easy!

Wow!  No wonder this is a top-rated recipe.  Heat was perfect - enough for a bit of zing but not so much that you need a glass of water.  The cooking odours were very strong but at least now that spring is coming we were able to open the windows.  A very easy recipe that I'll use often.  Many thanks!

By far my favorite dish so far, we love spicy foods (Cayenne Pepper replaces black pepper for us on everything) and so I added a bit of Sriracha Hot Sauce and a bit more red pepper (ground and flakes) and doubled the sauce like most people suggested and used a whole bag of frozen raw shrimp just took the tails off first.

This is a very simple, no fuss recipe for a good gravy when you don't feel like spending more effort on dinner. Although I do find the sauce a little on the sweet side, maybe less ketchup and honey and more red pepper?

Made this for myself and my 11 year old tonight.  Excellent!  Used olive oil instead of vegetable and served over brown rice.  Also added some cooked broccoli and adame.  I can't wait to try it again with various veggies.

This is possibly the best recipe I have ever found on this site!!! Its sooo good!! I added half a bag of stir fry veggies and served it with rice. It was super fast and easy and tastes amazing!! I would definitely double the amount of liquid when you add veggies though. I can't wait to make this again!!

good taste, easy to make. The only reason I gave this a 3 star is based on the simplicity of the flavor and its lack of depth. It reminded me of a recipe provided on the back of a can or box.

So yummy! I tripled the sauce recipe and only added 1 teas. crushed red pepper and it was a little too much spice. Next time I'll add half a teas. and go from there. Otherwise this was a big hit even with my picky hubby!

Really good flavor, but go easy on the ginger if you are not used to it. Very easy meal and make sure to use non frozen shrimp...you can totally taste the difference.

I added scallops to the shrimp.  Worked well.  I sliced a few veggies very thin, Mushrooms, carrots, peppers etc.  I also chopped up some cashews because my wife likes nuts on everything. I doubled the sauce but would triple it next time.  I sauteed the seafood seperately with a little butter, olive oil, lemon and salt and pepper and then added it to the vegetable and sauce mixture.   We agreed it was a "company" meal.

My family thought it was just ok.  For a fast quick meal..it's good...would not serve to company.  Not enough flavor and seemed a bit 'ketchupy'.  I used fresh ginger.  Also tripled the sauce and added broccoli.  Let the shrimp marinade a little in sesame oil and juice from a clementine.

I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't good.  I'm so glad I didn't make this for company.  The texture and spiciness of the sauce was okay - it was the taste that got me.  It was a strong, bad taste.  Will never make again.

Used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and added fresh stir fried vegetables.  Very good.  Just the right amount of hotness.  Will definitely make it again.

I  sauteed the shrimp with a coating of cornstarch as one reviewer suggested because I feared them overcooking and liked the idea of crisping them up.As a result, however, the sauce (which must be doubled) was too thick. and the flavor just wasn't right. I began adding more honey to taste and white wine to thin and it came out perfectly!

Made this for dinner last night.  It was fantastic.  I doubled the sauce and used frozen uncooked shrimp from costco which I added when I was cooking the green onions and garlic.  Next time I'll triple the sauce.  I can't wait to make it again.  YUMMY!

Would have rated 4 1/2 stars if available. It was very good, super simple. I had frozen shrimp so I quickly cooked it in a little oil in the frying pan. Took the shrimp out of the pan and cooked the sauce so I didn't overcook my shrimp, the cooking of the sauce only took a couple of minutes. The only thing I would change is perhaps using low sodium soy. It was a little too salty, but I served it over white rice and it absorbed most of the saltiness. But as a salt lover, just a tad too much.

Other than halving the crushed red pepper, I made the recipe exactly as stated.  It was excellent.  What could make this recipe better is to use fresh ginger in place of ground ginger.

This wasn't bad, but it was far from great, I used raw shrimp, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was watery and I let it cook hoping it would thicken up, as the recipe indicated. After a few minutes it was still watery and the shrimp was getting rubbery. Overall, I was disappointed given all the hype over this recipe. I may give it another shot, though, but will instead cook the shrimp and sauce separately (and thicken it up with cornstarch) then pour it over the shrimp.

Would have given it 5 stars, but it was a little too spicy for me. I would cut the red pepper down to 1/4 teaspoon.  My guests liked it, but they like very spicy food.  I will make it again.

Loved this recipe! I did everything just as the recipe stated, and we all thought it was awesome! I will say, I would definitely double it next time.....no way it's 4 servings, and we're not big eaters. It was just enough for my husband and I. Oddly, I made the kids something else bc it said it wasn't kid friendly, but my 11 yr old tasted the shrimp and proceeded to eat half of mine! OH, I did add a bit more pepper flakes than called for, and it was perfect, so wouldn't have been too hot at all with original amount.....maybe not hot enough! Will double shrimp & sauce next time. Served it with fresh broccoli, white rice, and lowfat shrimp eggrolls I found at Walmart (they were actually good too :)! )

it was good, not the best thing i've ever had. i don't know what i didn't care for about it. i accidently put in a teaspoon extra soy sauce, but i don't think it was that! anyway, we had it with broccoli and white rice. but i don't think we will make it again, nothing special

This has to be one of the best dishes I have tried on Allrecipes. I made only minor changes. For the sauce, I tripled it. Also, some reviewers commented that the dish tasted too much like ketchup. I decreased the amount of ketchup by 1/3. For the shrimp, garlic and onions, I sauteed them all at the same time in olive oil (instead of vegetable oil) until the shrimp were opaque. I also steamed a bag of Asian veggies (for a minute or two less than the bag says or they will be too soft) and some pea pods (cause I love them). I prepared brown rice. I placed the rice on the plates and the veggies on top.  Then added the shrimp on top of the veggies.  This dish has just the right amount of spice. I would use everything (except maybe the ketchup) in the amounts stated in the recipe. Also, some of the reviewers commented that fresh ginger should be used. I really don't think it matters as the dish is spicy enough that you can't really tell if the ginger is ground or fresh.  I consider this recipe good enough to serve to company. This is definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe. I don't usually like spicy food, but I found this to be just the right amount of bite without burning your mouth!! I made it the first time and found not enough sauce to cover the rice I served it with. So the second time I made it I times the sauce part by 4 and doubled the shrimp I used. Turned out perfect and SOOO EASY!

I've made this several times.  Both the husband and I really like it.  We add a little extra red pepper flakes because we like the heat!  Super easy to make!  This is something even a novice like me can make!

This recipe is good and easy to make. I cooked it with chicken and it was very tender with lots of flavor. I gave it a 4 because even though the flavor was good it wasn't great. I added tsp of sugar.

Very good. Had to cut back the crushed red pepper a little, since I have a two year old to feed. I thought a bit too rich. However, I do think my palette gravitates toward lighter food more than most other people's palette. When I make it again, I'll probably cut back the corn starch.

This is one of the best shrimp meals you can make and it always impresses! The sauce alone is amazing! Everyone always asks about it now and the best part about it is its VERY simple to make.  Just some advice: If you make a large batch, (Basically anything 2 pounds and above) be sure to drain most of the water before you put in the sauce.. If you don't, the flavor will be less "Flavorful."   I always make a little changes here and there to make it my own, but the recipe as a core, is one of the best shrimp recipes around!

This was very quick and very good!  I didn't have quite all the ingredients on hand, but I was able to substitute.  My crushed red pepper was very old and didn't smell like anything, so I used cayenne instead.  I didn't have green onions or fresh garlic, so I used a frozen "seasoning mix" of chopped onion and red and green bell pepper, and granulated garlic.  My uncle is on a reduced salt diet, so I used low sodium soy sauce.    I tripled the sauce like others had, and it was just the right amount to toss into the egg noodles I served it with.  I was afraid I had used too much cayenne, so I added some (less spicy) salt-free peanut sauce.  That mellowed out the cayenne and preserved the Asian theme.  I had almond oil, so I used that instead of regular vegetable oil to give it another dimension.  I simmered the seasoning mix in the almond oil while I mixed the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I added the remainder of the sauce to the skillet, and put the egg noodles in boiling water.  When the egg noodles were done, I added the cooked shrimp to the skillet, stirred for a moment, turned off the heat, and stirred for another minute, then removed it from the heat.  I didn't want the shrimp to overcook, and it didn't.  The only reason I don't give this five stars is that it isn't the sort of thing I put in my mouth and think, "where have you been all my life?"  That would be a five-star recipe.  But this was very good and quick, which was just what I needed.  Thanks!!!  :)

This was excellent!  The flavors worked so well together.  I love spicy food and this definitely had a kick but not overpowering.  I made this alongside brown rice and sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms.  And it made leftovers since it was just the hubby and I (I love when a good dinner makes enough for leftovers... it makes me look forward to work!).  I use natural Heinz ketchup (no HFCS) so all in all, this is a healthy, well-balanced, flavorful meal that will be made again and again!!

Delicious recipe! We thoroughly enjoyed this one.  I did follow other reviewers comments and tripled the sauce, I like lots of sauce to soak up in to the rice that I make along with it.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

This dish was very good. Like others mentioned, I doubled the amount of sauce and added broccoli and onions.  To add more flavor to the sauce add a table spoon of Touban Djan (chili bean paste), which can be found at an asian market.

Eating it up right now. Cooked up some brown rice and user #91 shrimp (about .75lb). While making up the sauce I couldn't help myself from eating about 4-5 shrimp before they hit the rice! Yumm-O!

This is a good start, but I will add more heat next time.  The sauce is an excellent marinade that I will definitely use again.  I used it on salmon.

great recipe!  didn't really change a thing besides tripling the sauce and adding a bag of fresh veggies (broccoli, snow peas, and carrots).  i began with the scallions and garlic in oil first.  then i added the shrimp and let them cook for several minutes.  meanwhile, i steam the vegetables in a different pot.  by the time the shrimp is cooked, the vegetables should be done.  i strain the vegetables and then add them, along with the sauce, to the shrimp and garlic and scallion mixture.  i served it over brown rice.  perfect!

Great recipe, quick,easy,healthy and delicious! I loved it so did my boyfriend. The Only thing I changed was the vegetable oil to sesame oil. I used 1 TSP sesame oil and I added more ginger. If you really want to give that Chinese taste, this will defiantly do it! The spiciness is just fine the way the recipe calls for. I served this over white rice and it's defiantly a keeper!!

This recipe has taken the place of our every Sunday takeout order!!  I've never used pre-cooked shrimp...I cook the shrimp for around 3 mins in the pan then add the sauce and green onion.  I usually throw some fresh broccoli in there as well.  I think this would be a great recipe with chicken too.

This dish was amazing! Per other reviews, I tripled the sauce but only doubled the crushed red pepper. I did add a tablespoon of hoisin sauce to the sauce mix and served it over rice. I added broccoli and red bell peppers as well.

Out of green onions so used white onions, also added 1/2 a red bell pepper (needed to use it) it was very good but it was missing something.. I added onion & garlic powder

I thought this was delicious.  My boyfriend did also until he found out one of the ingredients was ketchup!  Like some other reviews said, don't let the ingredients fool you.

This came out really well! I doubled the sauce, and it still wasn't quite enough sauce! I also used fresh ginger instead of ground.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is great every time.  I have tried it with breaded chicken & rice, then with veggies added, with shrimp & rice.  I usually don't use green onions, just my preference.  Thanks FOODGU1, awesome recipe.

There's definitely a reason this dish is on the Top 20 for Healthy Recipes > Main Dishes. I made this for the first time tonight and we devoured this authentic tasting dish within minutes! I doubled the sauce as others suggested and used Gau Choy Fa (Chinese Garlic Chives) instead of green onions. I'll be making this again and again for sure.

As others have mentioned, the sauce is indeed too "ketchup-y". Everything else about the dish tasted fine, but I don't think this is the authentic preparation of the dish. I tripled the sauce (only the "wet" ingredients) because I added vegetables but it was way too much. I felt this was missing an ingredient to give it "Asian flare".

Fabulous!  Just the right amount of spice.  I had raw shrimp, so I just cooked a little longer.  Served over brown rice with steamed veggies for a quick and delicious dinner.

This is a great recipe. I didn't double the sauce like others have suggested, but it was still yummy. I added a little more heat with Thai chili sauce, but besides that the recipe is perfect. I will definitely make again.

This was quite good!  I always try to avoid changing things the first time around, but this time I couldn't quite do it.  I used raw shrimp instead of cooked and chicken broth instead of water because I had both; I didn't want to cook a separate vegetable, so I added broccoli, snow peas and shredded carrots.  To compensate for the extra ingredients, I tripled the sauce.  Honestly, I'm not sure I'd do that again; the sauce got exponentially less tasty as I increased it, growing slightly bitter from the ground ginger and crazy, crazy spicy.  In retrospect, it would have been a better dish if I'd used fewer veggies and only half the sauce.  This is all my fault, but learn from my mistakes!  Aside from my own mistakes, I thought the sauce was just a bit too ketchupy, thus the four stars.  Next time I might try subbing a tablespoon of hoisin for one of the tablespoons of ketchup.  Thanks for a great dinner, though!

Used regular frozen prawns and they shrunk to miniscule size, will make sure to use jumbo prawns next time.  Not so sure about the tomato sauce, had to add extra chilli paste to get rid of overpowering tomato flavour, might use sweet chilli sauce instead next time.

The best homemade "Chinese" I've ever had!  I also tripled the sauce and think next time I'll make even more.  I used fresh ginger as another reviewer suggested.  It made all the difference in the world!  Very fresh and spicy!  I'll definitely make this again and again!

Great recipe! Some change I made: I first stir fried the shrimp a little bit just until it was almost cooked, then put it aside, then stir fried some broccoli, bell peppers and onions until cooked, then threw the shrimp back in and mixed it all together with the sauce.  Tastes great! Next time I might add some more red pepper for extra kick though!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I made a few changes for our tastes and it was great.  I didn't use cornstarch and I used olive oil instead of veg oil.  I also put in 1tsp of crushed red pepper for more spice.  I added 1tbsp of Low Fat Newman's Own Sesame Ginger dressing, a cup of mushrooms, and a few splashes of red wine vinegar.

This was great.  I didn't have ketchup so I used hot wing sauce and just didn't add as much red pepper flakes.  It was great!  Thanks!

This was fantastic!! I've been looking for a recipe I could use instead of a pkg. This beats a pkg hands down!! I needed to add a bit of water at the end, for a little more sauce, I served it with basmati rice (with tumeric and butter added to the water) WOW, Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

This was so much better than I expected and so so easy.  I added carrots, celery, and bean sprouts to it.  Had leftovers for lunch the next day and it tasted even better.  Will be making this often.

So incredibly easy and wonderfully saucy. Doubled the sauce, stirred in steamed broccoli at the end, and served over noodles.

This dish is great considering it whips together so fast!  I would agree with a few other reviews and say the fresh ginger really would have brought out the flavor...I added broccoli and doubled the sauce...very good!  Definitely has a bite to it....not recommended for small kids.

Overall, a great recipe and really tasty. I tripled the sauce, which I won't do again... waaaay more than I needed. I thought the ketchup flavor was considerably noticeable which I am going to try to finesse when I make this again... maybe substitute chile sauce. In any case - I thought it was really tasty and much healthier than ordering takeout. I served it with steamed brown rice and broccoli pan steamed with minced garlic and a bit of sesame oil. Delish!

I will be using this many more times! Great as is! I agree with a previous reviewer - if you add frozen vegetables, be sure to double/triple the sauce. I also used uncooked shrimp and cooked briefly before adding the sauce. I was worried they would be too rubbery because of the time needed to cook down the sauce, but they were perfect! Thank you!

This was okay and only okay. There was anything special about it, however, it was easy to make and it looked good. The color of the sauce came out nice but the flavor was lacking

This dish is easy and delicious. Like Chinese takeout but without the grease. Some slight changes: I used chicken instead of shrimp, added an extra tablespoon of ketchup and some sugar to the sauce and also added some chopped cilantro at the end. Not sure if the cilantro will work with shrimp but my husband loved it with the chicken!

This was delicious! I added some oyster mushrooms, which I sauteed with the green onions and garlic, a bag of frozen asian veggies, and about 1/4 cup slivered almonds, which gave it a nice crunch. Served over rice. Unless you like your food spicy, you might want to reduce the red pepper.

Made this for lunch for my friends and we all loved it.  I doubled the sauce due to the fact that I added fresh stir fry veggies (broccoli, onion, yellow pepper, and mushrooms) to this.  Served it over rice.  This is a keeper.

Awesome!  The flavor is really good and my husband loved it.  I agree with others, use fresh shrimp.  Really easy.  Just cook about one minute, turn and add some cooked, frozen asian style veggies and the sauce (double the amount).  Cook until it thickens.  Perfect!  I added some cayanne as my husband and I love heat, but I'm not sure it was necessary since it was a touch spicier than I needed after that.

SUPER easy and fast recipe---yummy, too!  My husband likes things saucy so I'll double the recipe next time.  But for me, following the direction to a T was perfect.  While mixing the ingredients I actually didn't think I was going to like this.....but I did!  Oh, it is a bit spicy.  I used a little less than 1/2 a tsp red pepper and it was still too hot for my taste.  The hubby was happy though!

I thought this was very easy and very tasty, but my hubby wasn't overly impressed.  I think next time I will kick up the heat a little more and maybe add some sweetness as well.  Nice beginning, though.

I have tried this a few times and the results have always been spectacular. I'm learning to cook and this is fast and easy. Far better than you would expect given the time it takes.  I plan to make it for my next potluck at work.

Very good, I messed up though and didn't cook shrimp prior to sauteing the garlic and onion, so I cooked the shrimp with the saute, didn't mess it up any.  Will definatley be making again.

When it comes to stir-fired meals my wife is a pro. However, this recipe turned her head and we both gave it thumbs up. The only change was a slight reduction in red pepper to suit our tastes.

Yummy!!!  I did quadruple the sauce since I was serving it over rice.  DH is picky but he enjoyed it!  I did not quadruple the red pepper though, left it as single serving quantity.

This recipe is really a Keeper. My husband enjoyed it so much he had me just make the Sauce and mix Blackbeans in and then stir into pre cooked rice. Grandkids came over and completely wiped it out. My only suggestion is to double the Sauce. It is the BEST!!!

Good and easy!  Quick to work up for dinner - the family enjoyed it!  Next time I'd add more garlic, more ginger, more honey, more soy and more red pepper (I only put a dash in so as not to frighten the kids) - I did double the sauce and served it over brown rice with a stir-fry vegetable mix.

WOW!! This turned out better then I had hoped! I used fresh ginger instead of ground(much better than ground). I also cooked some fresh broccoli with it for something extra. I tripled the amount of sauce so that I would have plenty to pour over the rice. An outstanding recipe!

Good....I tripled the sauce because I also added a bag and a half of mixed frozen stir fry veggies to bulk this up to a complete meal. I did use a pound of shrimp also. I am glad I tripled the sauce as everything was nicely coated. The flavor was good....I may reduce the cornstarch next time. I just think it is hard to duplicate food from my fave Chinese restaurant,,,never tastes the same. This was very easy and tasty....a good week night meal.  Will make again....served with rice. Thanks!

Fixed this using partially frozen cooked shrimp and it turned out great. I doubled the sauce, but not the honey and red pepper flakes as suggested. The extra sauce was appreciated, but I would not quite double the pepper flakes. I would have like a little more heat. Will make again.

Doubled the sauce and used one pound of shrimp. Next time i will triple or quadruple the sauce. It was yummy! A nice quick meal if you use the frozen shrimp.

I made this for my husband the first time I had him over for dinner.  It was his birthday and I wanted to make something special, this was PERFECT!  It was easy to make and it looked like I slaved over the stove.  I served it over white rice and broc.  I didn't have the green onions and so I used an onion instead and I doubled the ingredients for the sauce.

Very good, everyone liked it. I did double the sauce but I shouldn't have double the chile peppers cause it made the sauce too spicy.

At first, I assumed I followed the recipe exactly but I used Cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes. It was HOT.  But, the reason for only two stars is that I felt the sauce was  basically spicy ketchup. I don't mind ketchup but I don't  love it.  I won't make it again. If you are a ketchup lover, then you will probably like this.

Not bad, for using ingredients already in the house.  My husband liked it better than me though, because he didn't know what was in it, so for him it was more exotic!

I made this exactly as the recipe says.  Not bad but would be a lot better if you use uncooked shrimp.  I only had the shrimp in the pan for as long as it took for the sauce to thicken (maybe a minute) but the extra cooking still made them turn out tough and kind of rubbery.  Shrimp cooks so fast, using precooked shrimp really isn't much of a time saver and the texture could be soooo much better.  That said, the sauce is tasty and cooks up nicely - I love the idea of putting the cornstarch in with the wet ingredients instead of mixing it with water and adding it at the end - saves a step.

Excellent - double sauce - not honey - use chicken broth instead of water.  Ask S - add snow peas??? Use fresh ginger.

DEFINITELY use fresh shrimp, not cooked with this recipe. Otherwise, it's perfect. Toss in some broccoli and serve it with a little brown rice, and it's a complete meal. I'm adding this one to our regular dinner repertoire.

Great!!!! As far as the red pepper, I made the sauce without the pepper, then cooked up a small amount for my daughter, then added lots of red pepper to the remaining sauce for my husband and myself.

Excellent!  Just made this recipe for the first time and absolutely loved it.  I made it with broccoli, and cooked the shrimp in the veg. oil with the garlic and green onions.  I added salt and pepper, and cut back on the garlic a little.   I also don't enjoy spicy food, so I cut the red pepper in half, which was perfect!  Highly recommended!

Like others suggested, I used raw shrimp and added it with the garlic and green onions. I also added some fresh broccoli. My husband and two teen age boys loved it! Will double the recipe next time.

I made a chiffonade of bok choy and added that along with the shrimp (I used cooked shrimp) and served over jasmine rice. Next time I'll try using raw shrimp. I doubled the sauce, but didn't double the cayenne because of the kids. If jut for myself, I would double the cayenne too. A great, quick, easy recipe!

I decided to use raw shrimp and used mixed veggies (broccli, carrots, cauliflower). I tripled the sauce but accidently used waaaaaaaaaay too much cornstarch and it came out too thick! lol. BUT! Regardless of my own error, the taste was STILL great! It was a bit spicy. I love spicy food, but if you don't like spice, go easy on the crushed pepper. Great recipe even though I kind of messed it up! Will make (the right way) again!

Very fast, easy, and tasty! Used fresh shrimp and cooked them along with the green onion and garlic. While cookin the shrimp I heated the sauce in a separate pan and combined with the shrimp and served over angel hair pasta. This recipe works well with pasta or rice. Broccoli on the side or mixed in also goes great, thanks for the recipe.

This wasn't as good as I had expected.  I cut back on the red pepper and it was still pretty hot.  I also added broccoli and water chestnuts.  I don't think I'll make this again.

This is a simple, quick and delicious meal.  I made this for an unplanned dinner party and everyone raved.  Not only is it really quick to pull together, it was also a life saver because you will likely have all of the ingredients in your kitchen.  I made this without any "futzing" and it turned out extremely well.  I would recommend a light Chardonnay or possibly a Pinot Grigio as a sweeter wine to cut the nice heat of this dish.  THANKS FOR THIS ONE!

Great recipe.  The sauce was excellent.  This is a must try for any garlic lovers!!  The only thing I changed was to add some peppers and celery to make it a more complete meal and I served it over brown rice.  We'll be making this one again.

It was a good meal it just is not enough for 4 people.  It fed two and that was with rice.  Plus I had to add more oil to coat shrimp.  Otherwise I did like it.

Great meal. I used uncooked shrimp and added it a few minutes of cooking the onions and garlic. I also added mushrooms and broccolli and followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce...perfect!

Awesome and super quick, which is always good when you're a busy mom.  I added broccoli and carrots and put it over rice.  I used yellow onion instead of green onions because that's what I had on hand.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Everyone said it was nice and spicy and it wasn't. My husband liked it but I just wasn't a fan. The sauce tasted like ketchup and ginger more or less.

Very good! Tastes just like restaurants. I did double the ingredients but only coz I had more than double th shrimps and the sauce is just fine in terms of quantity. I also added fresh carrots and peas and cooked the shrimps with the onions and garlic before adding the sauce. Turned out great!

Great dish! I doubled the sauce and added 1 tbsp. of chili sauce to add more heat. I also added an onion, green and red pepper stir-fry, but you could use any veggie combo you like. So good... has become a regular dinner!

Really good flavor but not enough sauce.  I shrunk it down to 3 servings and it wasn't enough for the two of us even with lots of broccoli and chow mein noodles.  If I make it again, I'll still use 12 oz. of shrimp but double the sauce and add bamboo shoots.

This is an O.K. dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, ingredient-wise, but did double the sauce as others have suggested.  It packs a spicy punch so be forewarned.  The taste was simply not exceptional.  It is quick a easy so may make again.

This was really good - my boyfriend thought maybe something else was missing, but overall the flavor was really great, we both really enjoyed this, and I would definately make this again!  Also, I used fresh jumbo shrimp for this dish.

I didnt think the ketchup was too much at all. I doubled and used half to go on chicken and half on shrimp and it was great. I did put about half of the cayenne it called for because I have 2 toddlers eating it and it was still spicy for me.

This was bland and not spicy.  I didn't get the overpowering ketchup taste that others got, but it was more gingery than I like - ginger was about the only noticeable flavor.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I doctored it up at the very end with a little rice wine vinegar and hoisin sauce. I won't be making this again...even with doctoring it up.

We Loved This!  Next time I might add a little less ketchup - at first I could really taste the ketchup, but I reheated it later and didn't notice it so much.  I also doubled the amount of sauce.  Nice & spicy, will definately make again!

This was very simple. I was a little nervous how it would turn out and was left in shock as to how good it was. I did use raw shrimp. I am not a fan of reheating cooked shrimp, it ends up being rubbery.

So simple yet oh so yummy! Used more red pepper flakes and ginger than the recipe called for cause I like spicey food. Only regret is that I didn't make double the sauce so I could poor it on the rice.

Tasted great! I loved it with brown rice. I bought the shrimp from the grocery store, cooked but with tails - I very quickly learned to remove tails in a hurry. I added a lot more than 12 oz of shrimp but to me, the more the better! I didn't think there was enough heat, but it could just be because my red pepper is not good quality.

Very good.  We ate them all!  I'm thinking the recipe needs more sauce, but I don't really know how much shrimp I added--I think maybe more than the recipe called for (it was the rest of a bag of frozen shrimp), so it's probably my fault.  I served over rice and with green beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hubby liked it but I felt it was lacking something, not sure what though.  Heck, it could be because it was Szechwan as much as I was hoping for.  Maybe some veggies to provide texture?  Doubt I will be making it again soon.

Im rating this based on the flavor of the sauce. It needed to be doctored up a bit. The flavor was just off for me. Tasted to tomato sauce like and nothing like szechwan. Overall it was okay but nothing i would make again. It desperately needs veggies of some sort. it would be boring with just the shrimp.

This recipe is fantastic and it is so EASY!  I was a little skeptical about the ingredients at first, but I made it exactly as written and the flavors were perfect.

Excellent!!! I as with other reviewers added some of the garlic to the sauce. Also made 1 1/2 times the sauce. Otherwise made recipe as written. Excellent flavor, and spiceness all around. Can't wait to serve it again

I made this the other day using velvet chicken instead of shrimp. I didn't think it was that bad, but my husband did not care for it at all. Other than the shrimp, I followed the recipe, but doubled the sauce. The thickness of the sauce was a bit too much, and the flavor came out very vinegary/sour. And it wasn't hot at all.

Excellent!  I added a bunch of vegetables before I added the shrimp, and it rounded out the meal (served w/ brown rice) perfectly.  Also, using raw shrimp is an excellent idea.

Great Dish. Better with some asian veggies. Try adding some snow peas, baby corn, and water chestnuts. Also make sure to double the sauce. Fresh shrimp would probably be better too!

This was fabulous!  I double the shrimp so I double the ingredients and used stewed tomatoes in place of the ketchup.  I've tried this dish with brown rice and orzo.

Not quite spicy enough but good. I added a little sweet thai sauce to tweak it up.  Was happy to find a recipe calling for cooked shrimp.

This was ridiculously easy to throw together.  I tripled the sauce, used 3/4 lb shrimp, 12oz steamed broccoli and served over brown rice.  Tasted great, but a little too spicy for me (and I usually like things spicy).  Next time I won't use as much red pepper.  My husband loved it as-is.

The sauce was quite good.  We added broccoli, snow peas and carrots which were great but made the shrimp totally superfluous.  Next time we'll make it vegetarian style.

Pretty good, but a little bland. I think I used too much ketchup, so it kinda changed the flavor.

So good!  We usually add lots more veggies, like snow peas or broccoli (or my kid's favorite, 'baby' corn) and double the sauce.  This is a favorite at our house.

This was super fast and easy but it was missing something to me... Maybe becuase it wasn't that spicy I will use more red pepper flakes next time. I did double the sauce and I wish I had tripled it because there wasn't much sauce left for the rice and broc. I will make this again and maybe try the sauce on some thinly sliced chicken... Thanks for the easy recipe

as per others' suggestions, I doubled the sauce. i also used a little less garlic and pepper than called for because 2 in my family are very sensitive to heat. still had a great kick. I also added squid rounds and small scallops, which made it even tastier. I'll definitely make it again.

I doubled everything except the red chilies and I didn't have any garlic so I used garlic powder.  What ruined the meal for me was all the ground ginger.  Next time I will make it and leave it out completely.  I should have known better because we don't like that ginger flavor.  I did add some brocolli also.

As others have recommended I doubled all the ingredients except green onions and garlic. I marinated the shrimp in the ingredients for an hour. Next time I would add brocolli and cut back on the red peppers! Looks nice on white rice.

Perfect dish!  Add extra red pepper per your taste.  I added snowpeas, water chesnuts, and broccoli that I had on hand for some extra crunch!  Will use this over and over.

This was easy, healthy and delicious.  I will definitely make again.  I followed recipe exactly and put over rice.  Very tasty.  I didn't find it to be too spicy, but I guess that is just my taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great quick and easy weeknight meal.  For the sauce I did add more soy sauce and about a tsp of hoisin sauce.  I also added rough chopped broccolini with the garlic and green onions for more of a shrimp veggie stir fry.  Serve over rice with a good squirt or two of siracha sauce for heat.

This is a very good recipe. I followed what the others suggested and tripled the sauce ingredients except the red pepper. I used fresh shrimp, gingerroot instead of ground ginger, and fresh broccolli. I also sauted the shrimp a little bit in garlic and ginger first. The broccolli I steamed for 2 minutes. Then I cooked the sauce as directed, when sauce has thickened I added the shrimp and veggie. Anything that my 2 and 3 year old girls will eat without complain deserves a 5star

I would give it 4.5 stars, if possible.  Very easy, great heat, good way to make precooked shrimp edible quickly.  I did not like the cooking smell, and even the dish smell wasn't really mouth-watering, but it tastes good. I used the recipe exactly with 1 lb. precooked shrimp.  I steamed about 1 cup of Archer Farms frozen mixed stir-fry veggies and added it to the pan while cooking, then garnished with some roasted almonds for texture.  Higher points for ease, simplicity, and speed than taste.

This was a magnificent recipe for how easy it was to make. Took me only 20 minutes, and it was very delicious. I added some broccoli in for good measure and it was awesome! I definitely suggest doubling, or tripling the sauce, as I tripled mine and it was the perfect amount with our added veggies.   It is also rather spicy, which I love, but I cannot imagine my family being able to eat it, so I would definitely cut back on the red pepper if you can't handle spicy food. I would also suggest using raw shrimp, as others have stated, as it tastes much better. I used precooked shrimp and it was a little too chewy. Still magnificent though, thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

It was surprisingly good. I think it needs a bit more spice, so i added some crushed red peppers into the mix.

So good! We doubled the sauce because we added broccoli. We also left out the red pepper flakes completely. Don't be tempted to sub something like tomato paste for the ketchup - ketchup works great! will definitely be making again!

This was VERY good.  I 2 & 1/2 times the sauced and added about 1 1/2 pounds of cooked shrimp (all I had). I cooked the garlic and onion in olive oil (rather than vegetable oil) until tender.  Then I put the cooked shrimp in just a couple of seconds before I added the sauce (just enough to slightly brown one side).  That helped keep the shrimp from over cooking.  I also used about 1t of fresh ginger (for 2 1/2 times the original recipe).  This did have a good kick.  I thought it was a bit too spicy BUT my husband and son loved the spicy kick.  Next time I think I will add just a little less red pepper.  They can always add more at the table.  I might also try making this with chicken....

This was delicious.  I added about 2 cups of broccoli and carrots.  The recipe yielded 4 serivings but I only got a three small portions.  Next time I will double it.  The sauce was just the right amount, could maybe use for a little more if your a sauce lover.  I used a little less crushed red pepper than the receipe called for and that was perfect.  Warm, but not overpowering.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Excellent sauce!  Very healthy yet it's full of flavor!  We added some chili paste to kick it up a bit.  Next time we'll use less ketchup, it was a bit too sweet for us.  I normally don't eat much shrimp, but this dish made me clean my plate!!

Great Recipe!!! Definitely triple the sauce and add some veggies, like broccoli and maybe some bamboo shoots. They spice was just right, enough to add some kick to it. This is a keeper, quick and good!

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  The results were phenomenon and hit the spot.  I used raw shrimp since cooked shrimp just turn out rubbery but the sauce was excellent.

Delicious--husband said definite keeper!  I used 1 pound of raw shrimp and when I added it I also added a 10oz box of frozen broccoli spears I'd cooked and cut the stems off of.  Also added 1 med yellow pepper chopped, with the garlic.

Easy and delicious! I tripled the sauce, used raw shrimp, and added broccoli when the sauce had thickened. Served on top of rice with fresh green beans on the side.

The ingredients sound weird, but trust me, they work!  I double the sauce part.  I add the already cooked, deveined shrimps at the very end just to warm through.  I also add steamed broccoli - my preference, but you could probably use any veggies.  I serve with a fried rice from a packet.  Quite tastey.

LOVED this dish!  I doubled the sauce which was the perfect amount, and also added in snow peas right at the end (just to warm them).  I also added twice the amount of red pepper flakes which was a tad too spicey, next time I'll add a bit less :)  Also, added a few drops of sesame oil at the end.  I served it all over white rice - delicious!

I was looking to try and re-create a dish I had in NYC recently (best shrimp I've ever had!) and this sounded pretty close, except that one was creamy so I subbed heavy cream for the h2o and although it wasn't the dish I was looking for, it came out VERY good!  I doubled all of the sauce ingredients except oil and used garlic powder cause I wanted a smooth creamy sauce (left green onions out too).  Only did 1t cornstarch though cause the cream made it thick already.  BF loved it! Served with bok choy and white rice and it was a super yummy meal... Will definately make again...

Mmmm, just what I expected of a szechwan sauce - spicy and a little sweet. It was so quick too. I just steamed some broccoli before adding the shrimp and put the whole thing over rice.

This was very good.  We like spicy in our house so I am very liberal with the red pepper flakes.  Like everyone else I double the sauce.  I also add some chinese noodles to the dish at the very end.  I make it in my wok and it is wonderful.

This recipe is AMAZING!  So fast, healthy and delicious!  Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce and used fresh grated ginger root.  I used half the amount of crushed red pepper and that was plenty of heat for us.  I also only used half the amount of corn starch so the rice could soak up the sauce.  I plan on using this recipe with chicken - just add some veggies and you've got a complete meal!  Who would of ever thought ketchup would be so good in a Chinese dish?!

DEFINITELY double the sauce if it is going over rice.  My husband and I made this tonight and did not change anything, except doubling the sauce.  We had steamed stir-fry veggies on the side, but would recommend tripling the sauce if you wanted to add veggies into the sauce.  When finished, it tasted like a very fresh Lean Cuisine.  Obviously healthy, but still very good.  We each love spice and added 10 drops of Sriracha sauce to the top, and that really increased the heat AND the flavor.  Much better!  Thanks for posting such a healthy and SUPER EASY recipe!  Certainly will make again!

Great recipe!  We make it often.  I omit the red pepper flakes so our young children can eat it as well.  And I double the sauce, as someone else suggested.

I double/tripled the recipe like said, and i was bummed to learn about all the chopping of garlic I had to do. I despise chopping garlic, so, I might have not cut up enough green onion and garlic, but I didnt notice it. I thought it was okay the night i made it, but i just reheated it up. SO MUCH BETTER! yummy!  i will try this again, and try to make it hotter. i like it more spicy!

Very Very Yummy!! I agree that the sauce needs to be doubled or tripled. I tripled it and added fresh broccoli. I would keep the spice, but ease off the corn starch next time...it got a little thick. Served on rice.

Cut back on the red pepper and it was still super hot.  Next time I'll add veggies (snow peas, green pepper, carrots). Good portion size.

This dish was excellent.  I have made it twice now and both times was delish.  I took other reviewers advice and made double the sauce so I would have enough to put over the rice.  My favorite part is that, once you buy the ingredients (I use frozen shrimp) you have them for a while so you can always whip this up.  Not to mention the fact that it tastes great, is easy to make and is low in calories.  Thanks for the post!!

Just OK. It had a really odd taste to it. Doesn't taste like the ones i have had before. The sauce combination was either lacking something & a little salty and not enough sweet. Will need to tweek this one!

Simply delicious. As others have done, I used uncooked prawns, and they turned out beautifully. I tasted the sauce mixture before cooking and tweaked with a little oyster sauce, about 1tbl. Served with Jasmine rice and braised bok choy.

Excellent! I left out the cornstarch until the very end, mixing it with cold water and then putting it into the pan. I also put some of the sauce on the raw shrimp for about 15 minutes to let the shrimp absorb the flavor. Turned out great!

Very tasty. I over cooked my shrimp (so easy to do) but that was my fault. I served it over rice that I had seasoned with butter and lite soy sauce.

I made this for dinner tonight because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was just okay.  I tripled the sauce because I added some stir fry veggies but something was off in the flavor for me.  I probably wont make this again unless I play with the sauce.

I tried this recipe this evening.  I didn't have shrimp on hand, so I used chicken breast instead. I sliced the chicken very thin and stir fried it.  That is the only change I made.  I can't wait to try it with shrimp.  It was super easy and fast.  Served it with fried rice and homemade egg drop soup.  There was nothing left for tomorrow's lunch :(

This recipe was outstanding!   You definitely have to double or even triple the sauce ingredients.  I used frozen uncooked shrimp as the cooked variety would've been too rubbery otherwise.  My husband is constantly requesting this dish.

This dish was just okay (I'm disappointed as I had high hopes).  The heat was just fine but it just seems that something was missing from the sauce to make it more rich.

Great taste but overall the recipe needs something extra so I usually double the sauce and add water chestnuts, mushrooms, pepper, onions, (any veggie) so that it is more of a meal.

This recipe was good, but I was a little disappointed.  I kept tasting the ketchup.  I will probably try this again (because I really like shrimp dishes) and try tweaking the measurements.

What a hit! Just the right amount of heat to satisfy all of us using the crushed red pepper flakes. After sauteeing the onion and garlic for thirty seconds, I stir-fried the shrimp until just pink. I removed the shrimp from the pan and stirred in steamed broccoli, carrots,and mushrooms, then I added the (tripled) sauce until hot and bubbly. Finally, I returned the shrimp to the mixture to heat them through.

This recipe is ok but it didn't "wow" me or anything. I'm not sure if I would make this again. Thanks though.

Nice and quick recipe. I doubled the sauce - next time I will triple the sauce since I like a lot of sauce. Didn't have green onions, but I did have some frozen vegetables which definitely improved the dish!

This was a very easy meal to prepare and as has been written don't let the ingredients fool you. The only things i changed were adding a few splashes of fish sauce and more red pepper.

I substituted chicken for the shrimp since my husband doesn't care for shrimp. I quadrupled the recipe (although tripled would have been enough)and served with steamed stir fry veggies and brown rice. It was very spicy so I will probably cut down on the red pepper next time, but my husband loved it.

I was not impressed.  It lacked depth? I'm not sure, but I followed the recipe.  It needs more spice or something.  Don't think it will be a repeat.

Yum.  I added blanched snap peas and sliced carrots.  Used white onion instead of green (what I had on hand). Sauteed fresh minced ginger with the garlic(omitted ground ginger).

This was ok but I just didn't like the ketchup/soy sauce mixture. I'll stick to my own Szechwan/Szechuan Shrimp.

This recipe was so great and easy to follow.  My husband and I thought it was just as good or better than take out Szechwan Shrimp.  I served it over whole wheat linguine noodles.  I will be making this often.  It would also be good with chicken or pork.  I added more crushed red pepper flakes as we like things spicy.

I followed this recipe to a tee, and the end result was a bit bland.  I was surprised at how quickly this meal cooked, it literally took 20 minutes.  The sauce started out a bit strange, but once cooked it became a rich color associated with szechwan and a nice thick texture.  Nwxt time I would add more spices and vegetable within the last 5 minutes of cooking.  As per one of the reviews I opted to simply cook with the sauce as opposed to cooking before and tossing with the sauce.  I deveined the shrimp - but I did a little research that mentioned this step was not imperative.

This is nasty and has no flavor.  Blah!  The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because it was at least edible.

This was good but I think next time I will halve the ketchup - it was a little overpowering in the sauce.  It makes a nice and thick sauce though.  UPDATE:  Made this a couple of times already, and I realize how much more elevated this dish is with REAL ginger.  I won't make this again with ground ginger from a canister.

This was delicious and SO QUICK to make.  It's perfect for a weeknight.  I doubled the sauce which turned out to be a good decision.  It's pretty spicy, so cut back on the red pepper if you aren't one for spicy foods.  I mixed it with a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables, but I think next time I'll just use snow peas or broccoli.  I also served it with a side of brown rice.  For as easy and tasty as it was, we will definitely have this again!

This was a good low fat recipe.  I added a bunch of vegetables to the recipe and tripled the sauce.  I think I would put a little less ketchup in recipe because I don't really like the taste and could just slightly taste the ketchup but other than that it turned out great.  I will definitely make again.

This was AWESOME!  I added a bag of broccoli (fresh but cooked in the microwave) and used uncooked shrimp.  I tripled the sauce (next time I might do 4x the sauce) except leaving the ginger the original amount and using 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (we're wimps when it comes to spicy things).  This made two very generous servings.

these are really good.  I used a bag of frozen cooked shrimp and added just a bit more of all the sauce ingredients to keep the same flavor even with the water accumulated from the thawing of the shrimp.  I was glad I did this because it made some extra sauce, which was nice to put over rice.  Next time I will double (or triple the recipe so that I'll have some leftovers to take for lunch the next day.  Saying that this recipe serves 4 is that it makes about 4 half cup servings of shrimp that can be served over rice.  If you normally eat more than a half a cup of shrimp over a half a cup of rice than I'd suggest doubling the recipe.  It's a great recipe and I suggest everyone try it at least once.

I'm the worst cook on the planet; however my fiance was very suprised (and a little nervous) when I threw this meal together so quickly!  As suggested by other reviewers, I also added some frozen stir fry veggies.  I also served this over a bed of white rice.  FANTASTIC, QUICK, AND PERFECT!  ***I made this again for my sister in law who doesn't eat meat.  She loved it!  Even asked for the recipe.  You guys are making me look so good.  People think I can actually cook now!  HA...

This turned out really nicely. Four stars instead of five for the following reasons: 1) I followed others comments on doubling the sauce ingredients and I really don't think I would want to try it with any less sauce. 2) Next time I will use raw shrimp instead of pre-cooked - as others have said, the pre-cooked shrimp did turn a little rubbery by the time the sauce had thickened. But the flavor was great and it really did only take 20 minutes, which is amazing. I would guess adding raw shrimp would only take another 5-10 minutes, at most. Great recipe, can't wait for lunch today (I have leftovers!)

This was really great and easy to make! I made this for myself and my 2 daughters (11 & 7). I left out the 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper. This is a great way to get shrimp into their diet.

I made this for a family party and everyone loved it. I followed instructions from other reviewers; I used fresh shrimp and doubled the sauce. Also, I used all of the crushed red pepper and it had a nice taste but was not too hot at all.

So yummy! I quadrupled the sauce but it would have been fine tripled.  I added 2 cups of steamed veggies (broccli, zucchini and carrots) to about a pound of raw shrimp and had plenty of leftover sauce.  I followed another reviewers advice and only tripled the corn starch and ketchup while quadrupling everything else.  I served it with brown rice and traditional potstickers for a really healthy and yummy dinner!!  We will definitely make again!

This is very good, and quick, and easy. BUT, I've had it with shrimp that's tough and chewy. It should be almost calamari or scallop tender. And it cooks so fast that there's really no reason to use precooked (pre-ruined) shrimp.

We've made this recipe several times already.  I definitely rec. at least doubling the sauce.  We enjoy the shrimp w/ rice and bell peppers.  Oh, and definitely use fresh shrimp; I cook them in olive oil first.  Then cook the peppers w/ the sauce.  When they're almost done, I add the cooked shrimp.

I loved this dish and would make it over and over again! The flavors were really good and the heat was just right. I may actually add extra red pepper next time just becuse I love spicey food! I want to make this again soon.

This is a good recipe, and seems to be even better the next day.  Here's what I did differently 1) tripled the sauce ingredients 2) Added a little extra honey because I like things a little sweeter 3) Instead of green onions I used 1 sweet onion and 1 green pepper 4) I hate when pre-cooked shrimp gets cooked again - it seems to get rubbery, so what I did was heat the sauce until it was thick and bubbly, and then added the shrimp at the very end, took off the heat and just stirred it in.

Fantastic!  I've made it twice now, once using shrimp and the other with chicken.  Followed recipe exactly but omitted red pepper both times.  For the chicken I cut it into bite sized pieces then seasoned w/ salt and pepper and cooked it in some olive oil, garlic and green onion before adding the sauce. Turned out great.  This will be my go to recipe for something quick, health and delicious. Thanks!

I made this last night and it was very yummy.  I gave it 4 stars since I doubled the sauce per other reviews so didn't follow original.  Otherwise, it would of been a 5.  Very easy to make.

This was very good!  It has a good zing to it but not to spicy of a dish.  I did double the sauce as suggested and it seemed to be just right amount for us. I added cubed chicked w/ the shrimp.   Will certainly make again!!

I have never found a recipe which replicates authentic asian cuisine, and that is true of this recipe as well.  But that said, it was very good. I scanned through many of the reviews and used a combination of several recommendations in mine.  I think you do need to increase the sauce if you are going to serve it over rice.  I tripled the sauce recipe.  I cut back on the ketchup by 1 TBSP., the cornstarch by 1 tsp., the red pepper flakes by half, used 1 tsp. fresh minced ginger in place of ground, added a combination of about 3 cups fresh vegetables (broccoli, carrots, celery, onion), and a can of sliced water chestnuts. Use fresh vegetables and stir-fry unitl tender crisp.  You will probably need to add another Tablespoon of oil when stir-frying. The sauce complimented the vegetables and shrimp nicely.  This recipe would also be good with chicken.  We will make this recipe again.

Enjoyable dish. I also doubled the sauce and put in broccoli and served it over brown rice.  I did not double the pepper flakes and it was plenty hot. UPDATE: Made this again tonight but tripled the sauce recipe and only 3/4 tsp. pepper flakes. Used fresh red peppers/onion/garlic and frozen broccoli over brown rice. Pretty dish and full of flavor.  Husband said that is was still hot but loved it.

This recipe was super easy to make and it tasted delicious.  My husband said that it was better than most chinese food restaurants.  Little spicy but not in a way that I could not eat it.  If you do not like spicy food, only use a 1/4 tsp of red pepper.  I will definitely make this again!

For something very simple and quick, I'll give it 4 stars.  I've had better Szechwan, but the effort is certainly greater.  I used olive oil to be healthier.  I'll cook this again because it's a good balance of simple and tasty.

I did not like this recipe at all.  The sauce had a strange taste and feel (kind of chalky - probably from the cornstarch?)  I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what went wrong.  With so many awesome reviews, I'm really disappointed! I'd personally rate this a two (it was easy to prepare) but since my husband didn't think it was bad, I'll compromise with three stars.  Either way, I won't be making this again UNLESS he specifically requests it.

Wow. Talk about fast and simple meals. I would have given it a 5 if not for the crucial (I feel) additions. I followed the instructions of other reviewers and doubled the sauce; however, I kept the cayenne amount the same at a 1/2 tsp (I felt it was perfect, but it made the top of my dad's head sweat - my spicy meter - so I'll tone it down a bit for my parents next time and extra cayenne to my own bowl). I would suggest adding a couple of cloves (or maybe 3...or 4 - I love me some garlic) of minced garlic, substituting about a 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion for the green onion, and then frying them on medium heat for a a minute or two. I would also personally recommend buying a fresh head of broccoli and cutting off the florets in 1 - 1 1/2 inch long pieces with a 1/2 - 1 inch width. Then stir frying (3-5 minutes) the broccoli with fresh matchstick carrots with the garlic and onion after their fry time is up. Continue with the recipe, after that!  I implore you to avoid using frozen vegetables that are microwaved. It detracts from the taste, nutrients, and crispness.

I thought this was a great recipe but had two minor changes. First, i added an array of asian vegetables to the dish so if you do this, I would reccomend increasing the amount of sauce you make. Also, I lightly tossed the shrimp in corn starch and then fried them in vegetable oil to give them a nice texture. Overall this is a good recipe!

I thought the recipe was ok.  I didn't use ketchup, instead I used bottle chili sauce.  I added stir fry vegetables which my guy didn't like - should have just followed the recipe as is (he can be picky about his food).  Otherwise, an ok recipe - don't know if I will make it again as it wasn't that memorable, and I would rather have shrimp be the star than the sauce.

This was wonderful!  I added a large bag of frozen (cooked) broccoli, and doubled the sauce (didn't double the ketchup, but DID double the soy sauce). I am a wimp with spicy things, so I omitted the crushed red pepper and added a pinch of cayenne instead (perfect!).  I used 2 lbs. of shrimp (i.e., head off, 2 lbs. *before* peeling), and served over jasmine rice.  I think next time I will triple the sauce.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was a good and easy recipe. As per other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the sauce and added some veggies. It seemed like it needed something a little sweet to balance it out. Next time I might try it with snow peas and some pineapple chunks. Thanks for the submission!

I took the suggestion of many other users and doubled the sauce because I added some fresh vegetables. It turned out to be way too much. I would follow the proportions on the original recipe if I made this again. Otherwise, it was pretty tasty.

I made this with brocoli.  Everyone like it.  Got to be careful not to cook the shrimp too long when heating it up---mine got a little rubbery.

This was fast, easy and delicious! I doubled the sauce so there was plenty to serve over steamed rice. I didn't really measure things perfectly and added a little to much  ginger. This will definetly go into the rotation.

Excellent and extremely easy. I made it for a friend on Wednesday, and am making again for my family today.  Fingers-crossed they enjoy as much as he did!!! I think I may add a little cayenne pepper or a little bit more of the red crushed pepper as I like a bit of 'spicy'.

Great recipe! It was spicy, despite my doubts. I followed the advice of other reviewers, doubled the sauce and added frozen brocolli. I will be making this again for sure -- I may try adding additional vegetables (maybe mushrooms?) next time.   UPDATE: Made again with mushrooms, asparagus, water chestnuts and broccoli. Doubled the sauce again. Excellent.

So quick and easy.    The only thing that took any time was peeling the shrimp.   I added some steamed brocolli after the shrimp, before the sauce, and let it simmer.   Delish!

Not bad. I followed this recipe exactly and could definitely taste the catsup in the sauce. It is a fast and easy recipe, and maybe that's why it lacks the real Szechwan flavor that I'm used to in Asian food. It was sort of like a 'Spagettios' version of Szechwan Shrimp. But it's okay if you're short on time. Go easy on the catsup and use fresh ginger.

Awesome!  I doubled the sauce and threw in frozen shrimp and vegetables and it came out wonderfully!  I used a little less than 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes cause I'm not much for really spicy stuff, but I really liked the flavor of this recipe.  And it was soooo quick and easy to make!

My family and I loved this recipe. I took some of the suggestions to double the sauce and add veggies (frozen but cooked first). Also, I used raw shrimp, allow the shrimp to cook until pink. Then added the sauce. Then the veggies. I did not have any cornstarch so I used flour instead. Delicious

Wonderful!  A great way to get my children to eat their veggies!  As per other reviewers I quadrupled the sauce recipe, added a few more shrimp (fresh) and a frozen stir-fry veggie mix (thawed). Super easy and delicious!

I followed the sauce recipe exactly, but did triple it since I used more shrimp, added a pound of steamed broccoli and served over rice noodles.  We did not like the sauce.  It was edible, but something about the ketchup was funky.  My boyfriend, said it had a weird "twang".  If we make this again, I will certainly alter the recipe.  The spice was very nice though.

SOOO good! I cut the spice just little but decreasing the red pepper flake but it was still the perfect amount of heat. I made this for my dad who loves the local chinese restaurants szechwan chicken. He said he doesn't need to go back and gave it a 12/10!!!

This was a very gooey sauce.  The taste was ok.  I did double the sauce but not the red pepper.  It was spicy enough.  I used extra ginger.  If I try this again I would cut the corn starch in half.  Triple the sauce and add at least 2 tsp fresh ginger and more garlic.  It definately needed some more flavor, not heat.

The sauce was a great touch, savory but not overbearing. Loved the tang of the pepper. I used cooked shrimp and they weren't rubbery at all, they were juicy and full of flavor.

Hmmm....I had great expectations here but I tasted way too much tomato (rather than a Szechwan sauce).  I could taste ketchup. Maybe it was the brand I used or maybe it was the fact that I trippled the recipe (maybe the servings calculator was off).  Regardless, it's worth a try but not going in my recipe box.  Who knows.  I also used fresh ginger and it was a good addition.  Since I didn't care for the flavor, I really modified the sauce by adding 3T of peanut butter and about a tsp of sesame oil.  This improved things greatly. Give it a try, maybe you'll have more luck.

Excellent easy recipe!  My family loved it paired with a fried rice recipe found on this site.  Only changes I made were: doubled the sauce ingredients and switched the shrimp to chicken breast cubes that I tossed in flour seasoned with white pepper.  So easy, definitely a keeper!

This was very good. I did double the sauce, add stemmed veggies, and used frozen raw shrimp. All ideas from other reviews, thanks. My family liked it and I'll be making it again. Fast and easy.

awesome! prepared exactly as recipe stated, although I thought about adding more crushed red pepper.  Glad I didn't, because it had a great kick without being overwhelming.  Sauce was fabulous! Next time, I will double the sauce.

Wow! I was really impressed. With such simple ingredients and in literally NO TIME, it was done and we were ready to eat. I soubled the amount of sauce and served over white rice. The whole meal took less than 10 minutes and it was on the table. Now that's how you do weeknight cooking!

I really didn't care for this at all.  I wish I could offer more of an opinion, but I'm honestly not sure what it was about it I disliked so much... it turned out fine and my husband said it was "okay", but the leftovers sat uneaten in my fridge until we threw them out.

I am so disappointed in this recipe. After reading all the rave reviews I thought for sure it would be good. I tripled the sauce as per suggestions. Way too much sauce. Way too much. And I used a whole bag of big shrimp. The shrimp got rubbery because of the time waiting to thicken. And the taste was pretty bland. Although I like my food spicy. My husband wouldn't even eat it and he eats everything and loves Szechwan. Overall... disappointing is the word. I won't be making this again. Too bad. I really thought it'd be tasty! :x

This was excellent!  I wound up using crab since I had a bag opened that I needed to use.  I was trying to make a light lunch so I put this over a bed of salad like you would a scoop of tuna salad.  It made a very good lunch.

Sauce = great.  I added 1.5x the shrimp, didn't change the quantity of sauce and it turned out perfectly.  Added red capsicum, white onion roughly chopped, and long beans cut into 1.5 inch pieces.  Served it with rice.  The sauce-rice ratio was perfect - not too wet, not too dry.  Forget about buying bottled sauces from now on.  I tripled the crushed red pepper.  If you've ever been to SE Asia I'm certain you can handle upping the heat in this recipe.

After finishing this dish, my boyfriend exclaimed "This is the best meal you have ever made!". So yea, we're giving it 5 stars. I followed everyone's suggestions of tripling the sauce measurements and added a  bag of frozen veggies of the stir-fry variety.

This was really good. Although I've never tasted restaurant style szechwan shrimp so I have nothing to compare to but it was great. Very tasty with already cooked rice tossed in at the last minute. I will make this again and add veggies to it. YUMMY!!!

This was pretty good, although not quite spicy enough for me.  I added some cayenne pepper and some hot chili paste as well as some salt and pepper.

This was great!  It was extremely simple, and turned out very flavorful.  It reminded me of shrimp dishes I've had in Chinese restaurants before.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, with a few changes: 1) I can't handle spicy and put in just a few red pepper flakes, and 2) I  made 1 1/2 times the sauce.  I recommend this, but the portions given serve about three as a side dish, not six.  Enjoy!

One of my favourite recipes! Very simple to make! In addition for the shrimp, I have also used a shrimp/tofu combination. Next time I think I am going to use a shrimp/tofu/chick combination.

This was soo quick & easy to make I had everything on hand! I thought it was pretty good & loved the fact that it was healthy. I was however a little disapointed with the sauce. I was expecting something really great with all the high ratings, but I thought besides it being spicy, that it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I will have to play around with some more spices. Overall though it was pretty good & I will probably be making it again!

This was awesome!  Just the right amount of spice!  I made a few very minor changes.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil just because that is my preference, doubled the sauce and prepared a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables according to package directions and added to shrimp/sauce mixture just before serving over rice.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Eh, I was disappointed. I'm sure it was the ketchup, I'm not much of a ketchup fan and it really stood out in this recipe. I don't know how to fix that, and I would like to find a solution, because otherwise the shrimp tasted wonderful and I love that sweet/spicy sauce, but not the tomato-y-ness.

This was delicious!  I stir-fried some vegetables (red & green peppers, onions & asparagus), then added the shrimp & sauce as directed.  I was so impressed with myself, it tasted like something I would order in a restaurant.  Great recipe!

Very easy, healthy, fast and the hubby loved it! I added veggies and stir-fried for maybe five minutes and then added the shrimp. Probably would be too spicy for kids.

Very good ... but not a "5". I read a dozen reviews and decided to stay with the original recipe but double the sauce in volume. Next time I will skip the honey and ketchup, substitute another tomato product (paste ?) to reduce the sweetness, and reduce the cornstarch a little. Came out thick with little left for the rice. By ALL means USE FRESH GINGER!!
1/11/2010 UPDATE: I made it again last night, as written originally. I doubled the sauce and used uncooked shrimp ..... HUGE improvement over my first experience ... must be the flavor provided by the shrimp juices. Anyway - NO REAL CHANGES REQUIRED!!!!

This sauce is delicious!! I doubled the sauce recipe and stir-fried fresh veggies before adding the shrimp and served with rice, to make a complete meal. Also tastes great with chicken.

Excellent dish and such an easy one, too. I also added the broccoli and it tastes excellent with it. I cut back on the spiciness because of my 18 month old, but even with just a dash of the red pepper flakes, it was spicy! It has very good flavor and the whole family enjoyed it. Thank you for this one!

Very quick and easy; I used a pound of shrimp that I had boiled right before making the sauce. For the crushed red pepper, I used paprika. I think I'll use chili powder next time, as it didn't turn out spicy at all. This dish would be great with some sauteed snow peas, onions and peppers. Great recipe!

I really liked this - just the right amount of heat for me. I just wanted something quick for myself at my apartment, so I used 4 oz of fresh shrimp (just cooked it in the oil and garlic before adding the sauce), added some frozen stir-fry veggies (prepared in the microwave and drained), and left the sauce recipe as is for 4 servings. it worked out great - served over steamed rice, yum!

This recipe was everything that all the reviewers said.  My family are pretty big eaters so after reading the reviews I decided to increase the shrimp to 1 lb. and also added  1-1/2 lbs. of thinly sliced chicken breast.  I also tossed in mushrooms and a bag of frozen broccoli florets that I pre-cooked in the microwave for 8 minutes.  With the additional ingredients I also tripled the sauce. We absolutely loved it.

Very good. Would have been even better if my shrimp was fresher (DON'T GET SEAFOOD IN COLORADO!) Ommited the green onions (didn't have any), added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, steamed in the microwave, & doubled liquid ingredients. Wish I had used less red pepper. Will make again if I ever get FRESH seafood.

I really didnt believe the other reviewers when they said it tasted like shrimp from a restaurant after seeing the ingredients - I was wrong!  It was delicious!  My whole family loved it - even my 4 year old!  I took the advice of the others and doubled the sauce.  I will definately make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly, tripling the sauce (since I added broccoli).  It was much too sweet for me.  Next time I will decrease the honey and the ginger and increase the soy sauce.  I am really suprised by the high ratings from everyone.  Sorry....

Really great recipe! I doubled the sauce amount and added steamed broccoli, snow peas and sliced carrots to the shrimp. I did leave out the red pepper flakes and added a bit more ginger. Served over steamed rice and my teenage son thought I was serving Chinese take-out! Will definitely make again!

This was terrific. I did use freshly grated ginger. I also cooked sliced celery, carrots, mushrooms and snow peas in a separate covered fry pan, using some butter and water, while the green onions, garlic and shrimp were cooking. Then I blended everything with the sauce and served it over rice.

Very good and easy to make.  Our 10 yr old daughter made this tonight and it was very good.  we had a friend come over that does not each sea food so we saved some of the sauce for her and just added chicken. Definitely a family favorite.  Thank you for the recipe.

LOVED this! I used some Asian Stir Fry Veggies in addition - and I tripled the sauce, which wasn't necessary, doubling would have been just fine, but this is a definite keeper and next time I'll try with Chicken.
YUM-O! Thank you!

Great recipe!  I used a bag of raw frozen large shrimp.  Thawed out the shrimp under running water, peeled them, then cooked til opaque in the wok.  I also doubled the sauce and added a bag sugar snap peas that I prepared in the microwave and threw in the wok at the end of cooking.

This was good. Changes were: used fresh shrimp, used fresh ginger and had to add liquid (just threw in some red wine sitting on the counter) because it was way too thick. It had a very good flavor and my husband declared it a keeper. It cooked up quickly. We had it over whole wheat couscous because I was in hurry and couldn't wait for rice. Next time, we will use rice. It does need something like kimchee (Korean pickled salad) or some kind of pickle to complement the sweetness.

YUM! Hubby and I loved this. Great flavor. It was just a tad hot for me tho, but ok for him. I doubled the sauce, but it got kinda thick, so I think next time I'll cut down on the cornstarch (and maybe the red pepper flakes, too.) But it's a keeper.

This dish was excellent.  I doubled the sauce as some suggested.  I accidentally put in quadruple the red pepper (not realizing the measurement on the spoon), and "mama mia", what a kick!  We loved it!  It's a keeper.

I loved this recipe...Very simple yet very very delicious. I like some heat in my food but not a lot. I reduced the crushed red pepper to 1/4 tsp. I also served my shrimp with fettucini because I had some left over in the fridge. It was great with the pasta. Kudos to the cook who developed this recipe.

I made this recipe for a family dinner last night.  It received rave reviews.  I doubled the recipe and used the ingredients exactly as printed.  My son, who is an excellent cook, suggested that I use it as a filling for a burrito.  That's how I'll try it next time.

I tried this recipe last night and was disappointed after what all the reviews had said.  It's not a bad recipe, but it is missing something.  I'm not sure if it needs more honey, additional vegetables, less ketchup, or something else all together.  This recipe has such potential, but I'm not sure how to make it great.

Very Good!! I triplicated the recipe. An instead of shrimps, which i hadnt use pork (sirloin). Excelent. The sauce must be good even with just rice!

This is a restaurant quality recipe however I only used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes and it was plenty spicy and hot. Our company thought it was perfect. I served it over rice. I would give it 4 1/2 stars as I also think that the amount does not make four main dish servings.

I thought this sauce was very bland. I had to add salt and cajun seasoning and I still didn't like it. The family ate it, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  Would not make again.

This was pretty good. I quadrupled the sauce as other reviews said there wasn't enough. It probably would have been good enough tripled, though. It was a little spicy for my taste but my BF thought it was just right. I also added twice the amount of honey, hoping for a sweeter sauce, but it didn't seem to matter. All in all, it was a good dish, but not a "staple" for me.

My 10 year old LOVED it.  Other kids liked it as well.  We added chicken and scallops to the shrimp.  Also added some misc. stuff to the sauce like sweet and sour and pineapple juice.  It was yummy!

This was really good! I served it over cooked linguine and cut back on the heat a little, for our kids, but sprinkled the red pepper flakes on my and my DH's finished plates. I used a bag of stir fry veggies that I thawed under warm water and heated in the pan with the shrimp and garlic, and added just a pinch of cilantro, but other than that, no changes...this was sooooooo delicious. Definetly a keeper.

I used the full 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and my spicy-wimpy family loved it.  Also, I tripled the sauce ingredients, added in a bag of steamed veggies, and rice.  Even without the additions it is a wonderful recipe.  Hubs claims this as his favorite shrimp dish.

I agree with other reviewers that there is something missing here.  It tasted way better the next day when the flavours had had a chance to blend.  It was all right but nothing that I'd necessarily make again.

I really enjoy this recipe, quick and easy to make. The only thing that I find is that it thickens way up immediately, so we tend to add a little less cornstarch as we like it a bit runnier to soak into the rice.

Fantastic and sooo quick.  I have made it once with pre-cooked shrimp and once with raw shrimp.  Only took about an extra two minutes for the raw.  I did add some  veggies so after reading the reviews I tripled sauce which came out perfectly.  This recipe is on the monthly rotation list.  Tastes about as good as any shrimp dish from takeout, and I know for sure the shrimp is all clean... : )

This recipe was one of the best I have ever had for shrimp ... what I did was make the sauce let the shrimp sit in it and then put on wooden sticks and then grilled....Yum Yum :)

Well, I have to say I was pretty skeptical about this one, but it was great.  My husband loved it as well.  Doubled the sauce (man, was it spicy) and used 1 lb. shrimp, handful of snowpeas and half a red bell pepper.  Will definitely make this again.

This was just ok, I'm sure you could jazz this up a bit so you don't taste the ketchup as much.  At least that is what stood out the most to me.  My husband enjoyed it more than I did.

We didn't much care for this.  Quite flavorless for us.  I added snow peas which had a nice crispness, though.

I really don't know why people like this recipe. I followed it exactly and it looked and smelled wonderful but tasted so bad I couldn't even finish it.  **revision** my husband loved this dish after he noticed it uneaten sitting by the computer and decided to taste it. So at least one of us liked it.

Fantastic flavor!!!  I followed the advise of some of the others who rated this recipe and doubled the sauce.  I think next time I will add more pepper flakes as I like it spicy.  I also added mushrooms to mine.  Will definitely make this again.

Considering the high rating of this one, we were disapointed.  It lacked flavor, any good flavor at least.  Next time we make a shrimp recipe, we'll probably try something cajun.

This goes in the "good but not amazing" pile.  I used chicken in stead of shrimp and added brocolli, baby corn, and water chesnuts.  I also the did sauce just as written but x4.

I thought this was alright but it wasn't as great as I was expecting given all of the high ratings it has received.  I thought it was a little bit bland - perhaps next time i will add more pepper flakes.  Great for how quick and easy it was to put together.

I was really surprised by this recipe. I used 1 lb of raw shrimp, added some broccoli, and tripled the sauce. Next time, I think I'd just double the sauce as it was a bit too "saucy" for me. :) This was sooooo yummy!! Thanks! We'll be making this often!

I liked the ease of this recipe.  Was a little bland so added some salt and pepper - which helped it a lot.  If you like a lot of spice you'll need to add more red pepper, but the spice was just right for me.  Next time will try adding stir fry veggies and decreasing the ketchup a little.  But otherwise a good quick weeknight meal.

I was skeptical at first.  But, I thought I'd give it a shot since I keep all the ingredients on hand and I want to add a new flavor into the weekly menu.  I was very impressed.  It's very easy and very flavorful.  I like spicy food so I added some extra red pepper flakes...it came out super hot.  Delicious over rice! It's a keeper!

This was good but not outstanding. I think it was missing something. Boyfriend thought it was great. I guess I just keep comparing it to the szechwan sauce at our local chinese restaurant, which is heavenly. I will make this again, but I will try tweaking it. I think this particular recipe would have been better with chicken. Next time I will add stir fried veggies.

If felt the sauce to this recipe was bland. Next time I'd add some fish sauce, fresh ginger or ginger paste, sesame seeds and maybe a bit of anchovy paste for added flavor. I steamed green beans and mixed with sauce and soba noodles. Overall this recipe needs to be kicked up more than a notch!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  It was very close to the taste of take-out.  I used Chinese hot sauce instead of ketchup because we like things extra spicy in my family.  I omitted the onion for personal preference, I also quickly blanched some broccoli florets and stir-fried them with the garlic before adding the shrimp.  Everyone loved it, I will definitely make this again!

To quote the kids "this was awesome."  I used chicken instead of shrimp, added green peppers, a few sliced carrots, water chestnuts and tossed cashews on the plates as it was being served.  The kids (who are the pickest eaters) BEG for me to make it a couple nights a week.

I probably would have given this 5 stars, had I not been such a wuss when it came to the spice! The flavors of the sauce were awesome, it was just a bit too spicy for my taste. Meaning, my mouth was on fire! I was looking for something different than your typical teriyaki stir fry, and this was the perfect solution. But next time (there will be a next time), i will only use a pinch of the red pepper. I used 16 oz of shrimp, tossed in a bag of frozen stir fry veggies (lazy, I know), and doubled the sauce. It was a perfect amount for myself and my hungry boyfriend, and there were leftovers for him to take for lunch today.

I tripled the amount of sauce (had guests for dinner) it worked well. I had one pound of shrimp, and stir fry veggies. I also used a wok to cook it which worked great. I doubled the amount of red pepper, and added ground chilli it still could've used more spice. I'll make it again it was yummy.

I have now made this recipe twice and I have to say....YUM.  I would suggest doubling the sauce recipe.  The recipe really serves 2 people as a main course.  I have tried it on rice but enjoyed it more using rice noodles and they can be found in any asian food section of a grocery store.  I double the amount of red peppers to give the recipe a bit more zing.  If you find the sauce is too thick just add a little water to it.  It's a really easy recipe and so quick to prepare.

the amounts for 4 servings were such small amounts. I multiplied it 4 times and made the dish for 4 people. I only used 4 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper. It just made enough for 4 adults. I also used 3 lbs. of shrimp. It turned out perfect. It had just enough "bite" to it and was not overpowered with garlic. It was so fast and easy, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick meal.

This just wasn't as good as I thought it would be...the flavors were o.k., but no one in my family really cared for it. Am still looking for a good recipe for high-quality frozen shrimp. Will not make again just because shrimp is so expensive.

This is the best shrim I think I have ever eaten!!!  My whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe to the t and it was great.  I can't wait to make it again.  The only suggestion I have is to double it if you are feeding 4 people because 12 oz. of shrimp is not a lot.

I hate when I try a recipe having high hopes for it and then I come away feeling let down.  Unfortunately it happened with this.  

I did triple the "sauce" ingredients so that we would have more (which was recommended by numerous other reviewers) which was probably it's saving grace. I also added 3 full teaspoons of crushed red pepper (we like things spicy here) which gave it a good kick.  

I'm not all that sure I'll bother making this again since the flavor was kind of boring, other than the heat from the red pepper.  Maybe with a bit of tweaking this might become a regular in dinner rotation here...we'll see.

This was very good! It was quick, easy and delicious. My only complaint is there was not enough to feed my hubby and teenage son. Plus there was not enough sauce to get the flavors into the rice.  So next time I will double the shrimp and either triple or quadruple the sauce. It's a winner!

I made this reluctantly because my kids are picky.  I told them the sauce had ketchup in it, they tried it, and they loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe; it's quick, easy, and delicious.  I doubled the sauce.

I didn't think this recipe was very good.  The sauce was very thick and not very attractive looking.  It tasted like shrimp cooked in ketcup to me.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Pretty darn good stir fry recipe!  Tastes a lot like something you'd get at the little Chinese place around the corner.  I definitely recommend doubling or tripling the yummy sauce so you can add a bag of frozen stir fry mix or the fresh ingredients of your choice.  Tasty and healthy!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this receipe.  He went back for seconds...that means it's a keeper!  I did double the sauce ingredients and used uncooked shrimp.  I did first stir-fry a bag of Wegmans stir-fry fresh  vegetables with the garlic and oil and then added the uncooked shrimp, cooking for a minute or so.  I added the sauce mixture and let the shrimp finish cooking with the sauce as it thickened.

This dish is tasty, very fast & easy to prepare, and all the ingredients are pantry staples!  I halved the amount of red pepper for my kids, and I found the level of spice to be perfect, still flavorful with a slight kick, but not overpowering.  I also increased the honey to 2 tsp fore a bit more sweetness, and sauteed some carrots, zuchini and mushrooms before adding the shrimp.  It was delicious!

FANTASTIC!!  I made this for dinner last night served over white rice and we loved it.  I had the leftovers today for lunch.  I followed the recipe exactly but quardrupled the sauce and I'm glad I did.  I made mine with chicken cut into strips and cooked them seperatly first.  I reccommend doing this because once you add the sauce it only takes a minuet or two to thicken  wouldnt have been enough time to fully cook the chicken.  Its probably perfect for shrimp as it only takes a few minutes to cook. As far as heat I thought it was perfect of course we like spicy!!  I even added a few dashes of cayenne pepper (Oh yeah we like it HOT!)  Definately a keeper and will make this again many more times.  Next time I will add some crunchy oriental veggies  YUMMY!!!  Thanks for the post!

I made this for dinner the other night, it was awesome.  I doubled the sauce (all but the cornstarch) as I like more sauce.  I used fresh ginger as was suggested in an earlier post.  I shared this recipe with a few friends and they all raved about it.  I'm going to try using chicken, beef or pork, I'm sure that will be good also.

Yummy!  I did what the other reviewers did and doubled the sauce ingredients except the corn starch.  I think next time I won't double the honey as the sauce was a tad too sweet.  Overall, it was pretty good!

Not only was this delicious, it was so easy! Followed the recipe exactly except I crushed my own peppers so I think it may have been a little more spicy, but definitely not too spicy.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

This recipe was good, but I don't think it was close to restaurant-quality as some reviewers mentioned.  It could have used more soy sauce and other Asian flavors.  That said, it was easy and healthy.  I added snap peas, cut down the oil, and tripled the sauce as other reviewers suggested.  I'll make this again, but I will play around with the flavors.

This is my first allrecipe. I have to say this was great. I did triple the recipe and used "fresh cooked veg,ginger and shrimp". You have to add more water if you use raw shrimp in the sauce. using fresh takes more time but it is worth it. THANK YOU.

I made this last night and it was delicious!!  I used frozen, uncooked, shrimp so that took the longest to shell but other than that it was really easy and very good.  It's definitely going into my Favs file! :)

I agree that this was not "ketchupy" at all.  It was similar to the real thing, but it did seem to be missing something to make it really authentic.  But it was tasty, and that's what counts in my book.

Quick & Easy! I doubled the sauce, added more red pepper flakes, and added frozen stir-fry veggies (prepared) to the final shrimp/sauce mixture. Served with white rice and pot stickers. Husband loved it!

A good recipe for using leftover shrimp.  My husband and I both enjoyed this one.  Be sure to go easy on the red pepper flakes.

So good- tasted just like it was from a Chinese restaurant!  I will definitely double it next time as it doesn't make very large servings.

Absolutely wonderful!  Even good cold or reheated the next day after it marinated a little longer.  Used frozen shrimp defrosted for a quick dinner and it came out perfectly.  Thanks for a keeper!

Will definitely make this again, though probably with less red pepper. It wasn't that it was too hot, just took too much away from the rest of the flavors, I thought. I also didn't have cornstarch, so I made the sauce with less water.

When I first saw this recipe, I was reluctant. The ingredients seem strange but they were so simple, I had to try it! I'm so glad I did! I follow this recipe almost exactly once a week or so, it's delicious. The only thing I changed was the amount of red pepper flakes. It's perfect, I highly recommend it. You'll be pleasantly surprised!

Nice and quick to make, and not too spicy.  It's easy to use up veg too.  I used mushrooms, onions, yellow squash (cut into thin julienne strips).  My husband loved it.

This was awesome!!  My husband said it was as good as our favorite Chinese/Vietnamese restraunt.  I doubled the sauce and served it over Jasmine rice.  We had the Spicy and Sweet Green Beans(from this website) as a side.  Will be making again very soon.

Simple, tasty, wonderful! I like to add noodles to this dish, the sauce coats the pasta nicely. I also add a lot of fresh veggies- broccoli, red bell pepper, mushrooms, or snow peas. Whatever you have on hand, this recipe is great for adding extras; just be sure to double the sauce.

Good basic sauce, but I would double the amount of sauce if you use it in a stir fry dish over rice.  Plus add a little extra red pepper... zesty!

This was pretty good... if you double the recipe, be careful with how much corn starch you use because this tasted a bit powdery.  I'm a big asian food lover an d I think this could use some work.  It had a nice flavor (without the red pepper flakes it would have been bland) but it was too spicy even for my spice hot loving fiance!  Definitely going to keep look for a better stir fry recipe.

Excellent!  As others have said, definitely double the recipe for the sauce.  Also, I added more ketchup to mine - cuts down on the saltiness and that's the way my mom used to make it.  Delicious!

This was alright, not my favorite of Szechwan sauces I have made but I did give it 4 stars for its quickness. We added twice the pepper as we like it hot and that it was! We also crumbled crushed peanuts on top.

Very good! Doubled the sauce per other reviews, then added noodles after sauce thickened. I like spicy and thought if anything I might use a little more red pepper next time.

Really good. The sauce was too ketchup smelly for me, so I just added a little more of soy sauce. Otherwise, It was great. Hubby loved it...

Pretty good.  I one-and-a-halved the sauce and it made a good amount.  This is spicy, which we liked.  Tossed in green beans with the shrimp.  Easy and good, would make again.  Next time might add a little more honey for more sweetness.

This was the best shrimp recipe I've every made or tasted.  It was spicy and a bit sweet and my kids loved it.  Served it over rice with stir fry veggies.  Easier than ordering out!!!  I'll make it again and again.

Yum! I wouldn't change a thing with the sauce - it's perfect. I did add some other veggies, celery, white onion and edamame. I also started with raw shrimp -cooked that first and set aside. Then sauteed veggies for a minute, doubled the sauce -then added shrimp back in for another minute. This is easy and quick to make - I served it over brown rice, no leftovers - would definitely make this again!

I used this recipe as a base- I replaced the ketchup with tomato paste, the cornstarch with arrowroot powder and the honey with 1/2 tsp fructose. I also added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I really loved the results!

I served this over spaghetti squash and spinach that I cooked up in the surplus sauce- a definite winner!

I had the ingredients to make this recipe and had the urge to try it so I made it as an appetizer one night.. It was alright.. my boyfriend and I agreed that it was a little too spicy so i think if I made it next time I might use 1/2 of the amount of the red pepper and perhaps add some sugar to the recipe.. I think it would give it a good taste..

We were not nearly as impressed as others with this dish.  As did some others, we felt it was pretty bland.  I tried to "kick it up a notch" by adding some lime juice and then added some ground mustard but it still wasn't anything exciting.  I then added some onion powder and worcestershire (sp?) sauce which livened it up somewhat.  It was good - but nothing to write home about.  I wouldn't make it again.  For those who do like it, I used cooked frozen shrimp.  I thawed it in cool water and then took off the tails.  I let the sauce thicken and THEN added the shrimp, and kept it all on the burner but with the burner off.  The shrimp warmed up nicely but didn't get overcooked as I'm afraid it would if I added it and then cooked the sauce.

DELICIOUS! My husband doesn't like shrimp that much, but he loved the flavor kick of spice in this dish. Served it over rice with sauteed snow peas on the side. I'm going to try it with chicken next time!

Mmmmm! Just made this for dinner tonight and it was yummy. My husband  and 5 yr. old daughter loved it too. The only change I made was that I added lots of veggies to it. 1/2 of a large onion sliced, handful of trimmed peapods, 1/2 of a red pepper, a handful of carrots (both cut into matchsticks),1 small zucchini sliced, and extra garlic. I had made 3x the sauce that it called for as I thought I would need it with all the added veggies but I only used 1/2 of it and it was plenty. I didn't want it swimming in sauce so the veggies would lose their crunch. This is definitely a keeper!!

This was awesome!  I subbed curry for ginger as someone had suggested and added some stir fry veggies.  I agree that the sauce needs to be doubled if adding just shrimp and tripled if adding shrimp and veggies.  Great family meal!

I was actually looking for a homestyle sweet and sour, and found this recipe. I just added chopped pineapple, red and green pepper chunks, and some lemon juice, and we were very pleased with the result. I also adjusted the sauce recipe until we were happy with the sweet-sour balance.Very good, thank you!

This was delicious!  I had three pounds of cooked shrimp left from New Year's Day.  I used all three pounds and quadrupled the sauce.  The result was a very tasty dish that was easy to prepare.  My friends were very impressed.  Do pay attention to the amount of red pepper you add.  I cut it in half and it was still very spicy.  Great dish!!

You need to double (at least) the sauce for this recipe.  We also added snow peas before the sauce for an extra crunch.  Overall a fast and easy recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's so quick and easy, I've made it a handful of times already. If you're not a fan of shrimp, it's also good with chicken or scallops. Which ever the main ingredient, I always serve it with a side of steamed broccoli - it goes very well with the sauce!

I thought this recipe was good, but not great.  It was easy, and I will probably make it again.  The flavor was good, but the texture and appearance of the sauce was odd.

Great recipe.  I substituted the red pepper flakes for hot chilli powder since I was all out, and it turned out great!  Will make again

We loved this!  I doubled the sauce, as others had said, and I left out the green onions because I had none.  Next time I will add other veggies as well.  What a tasty, quick recipe!

This does not taste authentic. That said, who cares? It tastes great. Add extra garlic and fresh chopped ginger, stir in a few peanuts and fresh green onions at the end.

This was fast, easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe as others suggested and had extra to put over the rice. Served with sauted snow peas and mushrooms.
