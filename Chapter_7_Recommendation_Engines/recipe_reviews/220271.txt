I made some modifications and certainly, feel with those it's a 5-star.  First, I melted the butter in a large pan, then sauted onion, minced celery, grated carrot, garlic and shallot, as I think this was the main reason for the flavor, without it, I think it would be lacking.  I then added some white pepper and salt.  After the veggies softened, I added only about 2 or 2 1/2 T flour, which ended up being plenty to thicken this.  I like the idea of dry mustard, but did not have any on hand or would have added it. I whisked in the milk, slowly till well combined.  I then added in the cooked broccoli that I had cooked in vegetable stock.  I then pureed this a bit with an immersion blender.    I then added the softened (room temp) cream cheese (only used about 4 oz) and whisked that in.  I added the cheddar cheese (more like 1 1/2 cups) and stirred to melt it.  I had reserved a bit of the cooked broccoli and chopped it small, to add some texture to the soup, which was really nice.  I served this in mini bread bowl, big hit with the kids, for fun-factor!  The base idea of this recipe is really good, mostly because it does not call for process cheese food or to add a can of 'cream of something' soup, but is much more HOMEMADE.

Very good - I was looking for a recipe that didn't use processed cheese.  This recipe turns out creamy and has great flavor.  I used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon but other than that, I made it as written.  I think I will add 1/2 tsp white pepper next time.

Very easy and delicious! I was looking for a recipe that called for real cheese. Was happy to find this one. I left out the flour completely and thickened it with cornstarch instead. Also, I added some pepper and garlic powder. My kids ate it up!

This is so good! I don't use processed cheese so this was perfect!  I also added chopped carrots for extra nutrition and used a carton of broth instead of bouillon and water.  My kids and husband loved it.  This will be used again for sure!

Made this last night in the crock pot...it turned out great. Added the milk and cheese about 1/2 hour before I was going to eat it. My kids loved it...even my picky eater had 2 bowls full. I also blended it a bit at the end. My kids don't like onions, so if I can hide them I do. I will make this again and again!

I just made this and it's fabulous!  It's such a thick and luxurious soup.  The only things I did differently were adding some seasoning (salt, pepper, nutmeg and ground mustard),hit it slightly with the immersion blender, and using reduced fat cheddar, cream cheese and milk.  I may use a little less cream cheese next time to loosen the consistency some.  I am so glad to have found "the" broccoli cheddar soup for me and my family!  If you like a certain bread company's broccoli cheddar, this is the closest homemade version I have found.

I had to add a few spices to this dish to make it more flavorful. I added garlic powder, salt and pepper, seasoning salt and even a bit of cinnamon to give it something special. This really added to the already good soup. The only complaint that I had was that it was a bit too creamy. In all fairness that's just my personal taste! Great recipe! Might try again with ham or bacon bits!

This was easy and great.  Use the quantities exactly as is in the recipe, or you won't get that "OMG, this must be 2,000 calories per serving!" reaction you would have in a restaurant.  That being said, I added garlic, dried mustard (as was suggested by another reviewer), and used a different sharp cheese. I think that you could use any sharp cheese you have on hand.  I pureed it, as I didn't want to waste time making dainty chopped bits of brocolli.

I'm only rating this a 4 b/c it is VERY rich!  I would cut back the butter & cream cheese by 1/3. Per another review, I too sautéed the onion. 1 celery, 2 garlic, 2 shallots, & 2 carrots; then added flour & cooked a bit. Thin out with broth from broccoli water. Add milk to broccoli. Add onion mixture to broccoli. Melt cream cheese & cheddar cheese in soup. Added red pepper flakes & Siracha for a bit more flavor. Very good!  Serve with crusty sour dough bread & a salad.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I didn't like that this soup used two pots.  It had a odd texture and was really thick and coated the spoon and your mouth while eating it (which I think was a result of all the cheese).  It also had a strong flour taste.  That can be remedied by making a roux and cooking the flour instead of just putting it in with the milk.  For the amount of calories and fat this soup has the flavor was lacking and the soup just was not worth it.  I will not make it again.

OK....LOVED this soup!!  Be patient though, I made a few incidental changes, due to lack of the proper ingredients at hand.  I followed the recipe exactly....except, instead of cream cheese I used 8 oz of laughing cow (garlic/herb and French onion) and instead of the chicken bouillon, I used vegetable buollion....that's it, otherwise everything was the same.  KIDS LOVED IT TOO!! Thank you for this recipe. It's in my saved folder now.

My daughter and I LOVED this recipe. I did make a few changes due to lack of all of the ingredients and it turned out delicious. I only had 2% milk so I used all milk and no water. I didn't have any butter or cheddar cheese, so I added the rest of the cheese I did have on hand which was a couple slices of American cheese, a couple tablespoons of fresh parmesan and a couple tablespoons of mozzarella. I also added about a half package of dry Knorr vegetable soup mix. I also pureed the onions and the broccoli hoping maybe my hubby would eat it, but that was a no go (unfortunately he doesn't eat many veggies at all so I wasn't surprised). It was so delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

I guarantee this will be one of the best broccoli cheddar soups you will ever make! Add a couple of garlic cloves to the veggie mixture before boiling and some bacon bits to the creamy mixture then blend both pots together with and emersion blender! Serve in bread bowls and you will surely be overly impressed with this meal

I tripled this recipe, and found it just a little too salty, but not too salty to take away a star! I used half cauliflower and half broccoli, and this was wonderful! My kids love it, even the picky one. I usually add a shake of parmesan in the brew whenever I make cheesy soup, too. It was great.

I had some fresh broccoli that was slightly yellowing and so I searched for the right soup recipe and found this one. It's GREAT! Only giving it 4 stars because I too made some slight modifications. First, I used half the amount of Cream Cheese (4 oz) and doubled the Cheddar Cheese (2 c) and used butter instead of margarine. Also, Step #2 should almost be Step #1 as the Cream Cheese takes a bit to melt down. I love another reviewer's suggestion to add White Pepper, I used Black Pepper because I was out of White and I also sprinkled in just a pinch of Garlic Powder. DELISH!

This is an excellent soup base.  I did follow kayekrebs recommendations and think that this soup was pretty close to perfect.  I served my soup with homemade sourdough pretzels.  Will be making again!

Excellent recipe and perfectly heart-warming for a cold winter's day.  I doubled the recipe (thank goodness!) and it turned out restaurant-quality.  My teenage girls loved it tho they said they would prefer 'chunks' of broccoli.  I used my immersion blender to make a really smooth soup but next time will leave some chunks and perhaps make some of the additions suggested by others.  If not, it's excellent just the way it is.  Thanks!

Wow this was good.  I had a lot more broccoli than the recipe called for so I up'ed the ingredients and based on other reviewers I added carrots, onion and subbed butter for margarine. This was off the charts velvety smooth due to the cream cheese oh and I added more cheese - all things need more cheese!

I've never made this soup but I will be doing so from this point on.  It is delicious, yummy, and all other wonderful adjectives.  Thank you for sharing.  I added a little more onion and made the thicker soup.  Just wondering what the caloric intake is and how many carbs.  Baba5

Wonderful! Cheese flavor is better than any I've ever tasted in a broccoli cheese soup. Yes, I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand. Used half the butter, half the cream cheese, and added a bit of black pepper. Fantastically thick and savory!

This is so good!  I did have to make a sub since I need to go shopping (water & evap milk instead of milk).  I used a can of chicken broth with 1/2 a can of water, tossed in 4 chicken tenderloins and minced onion & carrots, used only 1/4 cup of butter, and added pepper, seasoned salt, and (a lot) of garlic powder.  This is a keeper!

Oh my gosh,  this is great!  I mostly stayed with the recipe but added a couple of carrots. Didn’t have enough cheddar so supplemented with Monterey Jack.  It is creamy and oh so delicious!

This soup turned out so awesome! I did use Kaykrebs suggestions and was not at all disappointed. The only change I made was to add even more cheese. About 3/4 cup more than she suggested, but then we are huge cheese lovers. Will be making this a regular soup.

Even my 9 year old (very picky) daughter loved this soup!  The changes i made were minor.  I saute'd  the onion until caramelized in a little butter and olive oil first.  And since my daughter is not big on chunks in soup, I blended it until it was smooth before serving!  Yum!

We LOVE this soup! I always double if not triple the recipe. I usually add chopped ham but today I added baby potabella mushrooms, yummy. Just FYI, the picture shows the soup to be green!?!? mine has never been green.

This is a good base for a cheesy broccoli soup, however it is seriously lacking salt and seasoning. I added salt, white pepper, Aleppo red pepper (for some kick!), and garlic powder for flavor. I was pleased with the end result and would make again.

My husband and I got up on this rainy Saturday morning and whipped up this soup together. Super delicious! I liked that it calls for shredded cheese instead of processed cheese food. As other users suggested, used chicken broth instead of water and bullion because that’s what I had on hand. Very easy, quick, and full of flavor. Yum!!

I followed this for the  ingredients the cream cheese makes it. I added flavour by sautéing onions, garlic, finely shredded carrots in butter, adding enough flour to thicken but not too much. Cooking the broccoli in the milk and I used chicken broth until cooked and then adding the cheeses......oh yum!!!!

I made this just as written with one exception: I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and I used about five cups instead of three. I also added salt and pepper to taste, as well as a little nutmeg. It was so delicious. And it says four servings, but I fed my family of four and had at least three servings left over -- or enough to make a rockin' chicken and rice casserole, which I plan to do.

This is an excellent recipe for flavor and quality. I will note that step 2 seems to mash several steps into one. We found this recipe works best if, at step 2, we start by melting the butter then whisking in the flour to make a roux. Then we gradually added the milk. The cream cheese works best if cut into smaller chunks. I'm sure most here know these sorts of things easily, but as a less-experienced cook I had to find out these techniques outside the recipe.

Note, if you do those well, this recipe is among the most amazing broccoli cheese soup I've had.

I did modify by adding potatoes and added an extra 4 cups of water to handle the potatoes. I also did not added any extra cheese to the soup. By doing this I hopefully cut the sodium more than in half. Everyone loved the broccoli and cheese soup with the potatoes in there also.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I used chicken broth (because I happened to have some).  I doubled up the recipe and used the extra milk and corn starch to thicken the soup. I'll be making this again!

Tasty but very rich so not sure I'll make it again. Used cheddar and a couple slices of pepper jack since I didn't have enough cheddar. Added some thinly sliced carrots. Used about 3 tbsp flour and that was enough to thicken it up. It was pretty easy. If I make it again I would add more broccoli. I used two crowns this time. Or maybe try it with half the cream cheese and butter.

Excellent, easy and quick!  The cream cheese really made a difference.  I made 1/2 the recipe and added a little Vegetable Magic, and about 3 shredded baby carrots for color.  I would make this again.

I love broccoli cheese soup and this is hands down the best I have ever had. Thank you for sharing! I agree  that it must be due to the cream cheese. I used low sodium, fat free chicken broth instead of water. Awesome!!

This was really easy to make and tasted great!  I added more seasonings to enhance the flavor (salt, pepper, Mrs dash, onion powder, garlic powder) and it was perfect.  I may experiment with different cheeses next time.  I hear gouda is pretty awesome in this kind of soup.

Best soup I've ever had!  I had my mom try it, then she had my fiance try it, then she had my brother try it, then he had my best friend try it.  They all loved it!  I didn't have any shredded cheddar, so I just used shredded mozzarella instead.

Yes I will make it again.  Even though I used fresh broccoli I chopped into tiny pieces myself and I had a seven year old helper it didn't take long to make at all.  

The only major change I would make is to do a roux with the flour and butter (I don't use margarine).  I went ahead and followed her directions except for substituting butter, but I should have put in the effort to make a blonde roux before adding the milk and cream cheese.  That would have improved the flavor and texture a little, but this is still great even without that step.  

Next time I might sauté my onion as well to see if that adds a flavor boost.

I made this with  chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. That was the only change I made and only because I already had chicken broth. The entire family loved it. I used an emulsion blender to make it creamy.

I used jarlsburg instead of cheddar but only because I had it in the house, any cheese would be fine. I used salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, turmeric and hot sauce. I added those for the health benefits and it was delicious!

Made this soup just as it was written in the recipe.  Very yummy.  Got a late start at night making it, but it came together very quickly.  The whole time I was making it, I kept thinking wow this has a lot of calories.  I guess that is why it is so good.

This was so delicious and creamy! My family's new favorite soup! I did what others did and melted the butter in a large pan and sautéed the onion before adding the other ingredients. I also used an immersion blender and pureed the broccoli then I added another cup of cheese. This is quick and easy and most of all...SO good!

Super easy and super yummy! Followed the recipe exactly (except I used butter instead of margarine because that's all I had). Very good!

Holy mother of soup, this is AMAZING. If you want your broccoli in chunks instead if spread throughout the soup, don't cook it as long. But wow this was so good!!

I followed the recipe exactly as is.  I didn't worry too much about fine-chopping the broccoli but instead just mashed it after cooking.  Wonderfully delicious!

I loved this soup! I was looking for a recipe without processed cheese and I'm so happy I found this one! The only change I made was adding shredded carrots. I thought it was super rich and creamy, just what I wanted. The whole family liked it including a picky 2.5 year old.

Delicious!  I hadnt yet made a broccoli cheese soup that I liked until this one.  The only changes I made were no flour and half the cream cheese.  Just our preference. I am sure that the original recipe is just as good. Thanks for posting, this will be on our regular meal rotation.

I've made this soup about 5 times in a short period of time.  The cream cheese adds a little richer broth and creamier flavor.  I found for a soup not quite so thick, I just added half of the cream cheese.  Still had the same flavor but not quite so think.  Both ways, it's a fantastic quick soup recipe

best ever!  for those of you who complained about flour taste, melt margarine, add flour and cook for a few minutes then add milk and cream cheese.   it's really a great, easy to make soup that has tons of flavor.

Super delicious! I already had some broccoli and cauliflower on hand that I had roasted in the oven, so I did this a bit differently. First started with just a few tablespoons of butter which I melted. Then stirred in two tablespoons of flour and stirred for a few minutes. Then added the milk...stirred some more. Once milk was warm, stirred in cream cheese. When smooth, added the broccoli and cauliflower which I chopped up pretty fine using my food processor. Then added chicken broth. Skipped the cheddar cheese because I thought it was super deliciou without.

We loved it. I like it because it was easily made,and made with cream cheese. Great meal with just adding a loaf of bread. This is my new cream broccoli cheese soup recipe, and I have already sent it to a friend.

It's a good start.  A little bit too much cream cheese for my taste had to add some herbs and cayenne to cut the taste of the cream cheese a bit.  If I make it again, I will cut the cream cheese in half.

Excellent recipe! I used vegetable cubes instead of chicken because that all I had. I also didn't have any cream cheese but followed everything else in this recipe and it came out amazing! Next time I am going to use reduced fat butter and milk to make it even healthier! Thank you!

We really enjoyed this soup. Very smooth and cheesy. I used chicken broth instead of water and granules. I also added a bit of salt and pepper. Other than that I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Nice to have a recipe that is easy and delicious!

Easy and amazing tasting.  I have given it to many people who ask me for the recipe after raving about it.  Sometimes I use vegetable stock (depends what I have on hand).  I have also played with the amounts of cream cheese and cheddar cheese but only because it's what I have on hand.  Amazingly enough this recipe is so good, it doesn't really matter when I have to change it a bit.

Extremely smooth and creamy. I cooked the broccoli in  vegetable broth. I puréed the cooked broccoli and onions. Then I added the purée to the cream sauce In increments to achieve the consistency I wanted.  When the cheese sauce seemed to stay lumpy, I put that in the food processors, and it turned smooth as silk A great result for sure!

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I ended up using garden vegetable flavor cream cheese (which I had bought by mistake and thought I'd end up having to waste since I don't normally like this flavor). But, it was really great in this recipe!  I used 4 bouillon cubes vs. the granules since that was what I had on hand and it worked out great.  Whole family loved it!

Made this for a 5-course meal for my mother and two sisters, which was my gift to my mother this last Christmas. All three of them were excited about broccoli soup, and they were impressed with this one. My sister said the soup was "very soothing" before asking for another bowl. I was going to bring some to my sick housemate, but he had fallen asleep.

I followed the original recipe almost exactly (minus for exact measurements) except I used whipping cream instead of milk, and liquid veggie bouillon instead of meaty. All went well. The 1 cup of cheddar was fine, as the cream cheese was a nice, subtle cheesiness that tied together the cheddar with the cream nicely. I left the broccoli pretty chunky and it was good too -- though I can imagine this would be great as a blended chowder soup too!

Great soup! The only thing I did different was use veggie bouillon instead of chicken and added garlic/onion powder and salt to taste.  Easy and tasted great!

I was thrilled to find a recipe without processed cheese food.  Overall, the texture and flavour were good.  I'd use more cheddar and less broccoli next time.  Worked well with gluten free flour substitute, but not with corn starch to thicken.

Delicious!  I did cut the cream cheese by about a 1/3 and the butter to 6 tbsp instead of 8 and used 3 tbsp flour, but put in 1.5 cups of cheese.  Used 2 12oz bags of frozen broccoli (chopped in food processor after cooking).  Also added salt, pepper, garlic powder.  Still needed more salt in my opinion, but I like salty stuff.  Very delicious- Husband, 4 yo daughter loved it, 2 yo son didn't (but he doesn't like cheese).  Next time, I would cut the cream cheese and butter in half as it was still pretty rich.  Soup would be good with potatoes and carrots too.

I used my own homemade chicken stock and about 1 1/2 cups good sharp cheddar.I also slightly browned the onions first with a little butter to give it a little more depth of flavor then added the onions to the broccoli after it was cooked. Next I used my immersion blender but I left lots of chunks of broccoli. The soup turned out thick and creamy and they loved the bits of whole broccoli. Great quick soup.

This is an awesome recipe. My kids and their friends had seconds. We loved it. I used a bag of frozen chopped broccoli. We have enjoyed eating this on cold days.   I love the fact it does not use processed cheese.  Thanks for sharing.  Sometimes I add a little spinach too.

My husband has been begging for a good cheesy broccoli soup. I don't eat it so I followed the recipe to the T.  He LOVED it and asked for me to make a second batch 2 days later.  I was also told explicitly that I was not allowed to change anything :)

BTW- the cheese quality makes the dish. I bought the good stuff.

I have tried other broccoli cheddar soups and this is by far the best. I have a gluten allergy so I subbed the "all-purpose flour" for a basic gluten free flour blend and it still came out delicious!

Delicious! I just added a little garlic powder and black pepper to taste and used chicken stock/broth instead of water. The whole family loved it, and even my picky toddler, who hardly ever finishes her dinner, asked for seconds.

After reading reviews changed things just a bit. Used 1/2 the amt. of cream cheese and 2 cups of all natural cheddar cheese. Also used homemade chicken stock. I decreased the butter to 5 tbs. and used skim milk. I made the changes to lighten up the soup a bit and decrease sodium without changing the recipe. I really like that it did not contain processed cheese. Will definitely make again. The serving size was about right for 4 good size bowls of soup, more if using just a cup for lunch or first course.

This is a really good soup! My 3 girls, 6 and under, will all eat it so that's a winner in my book. I don't normally change recipes but I couldn't handle the amount of fat and calories this would have. I know...creamy soups are usually high in fat/calories. I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 cup and the cream cheese to about 5-6oz. I also added some pepper since some others said it was a little bland. I should have reduced the flour too because I can taste the flour, girls don't know the difference. I will definitely make this again. May even use the cheesy mixture base for a homemade Mac n cheese but add more cheese.

This soup is great! I added carrots and a little ground black pepper, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  I also like that it doesn't use velveeta or processed cheese.  I took the cooks recommendation and used the 1 Tbsp cornstarch in with one of the cups of milk.

I followed this recipe to a certain point with a few adjustments. I used a whole bag of frozen broccoli/cauliflower Mix and chopped it very fine. I also added celery seed to the milk/ cheese mixture. Other then that it was pretty exact. The celery seed really gives it that kick it's missing.

It's great.  Did need quite a bit of salt, pepper and garlic to increase the flavour.  I really like the cream cheese addition.  I also only used 1/2 the butter it called for.

So good! I did half chicken broth and half bouillon. Substituted butter for margarine and used canned milk with regular milk to equal 2 cups. I added 1 large clove of garlic also. It was very thick- did not need to thicken at all. Just put a few sprinkles of grated cheddar on top. My husband loved it!

I made a couple of changes when I made this - I used the broth (seasoned with garlic, onion, celery, rosemary and kosher salt)from the chicken breasts I cooked in place of the boullion, and I made a roux from the flour and butter so the base would be thick. I'll definitely make it again!

4.5 stars as written.  5 stars with the following adjustments (in my opinion).  I added another 1/2 c sharp cheddar, salt and pepper, used butter in lieu of margarine and added a pinch or two of nutmeg at the end.  Very, very good soup!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, CARAMOMMY!

This recipe is reallyyyyy good but it was too rich for us, despite using half the butter, half the milk, and half the cream cheese!  I added one clove garlic, black pepper, and a dash of cinnamon for a little more flavor.

Creamy and delish. I used a whole package of fresh broccoli and added 2 carrots. It definitely needed more seasoning, but it was still a comforting, tasty, and filling soup.

Delish dish!  I added a bit of chopped carrot and celery and half the cream cheese, otherwise followed the recipe.  We like our soup "chunky", so I used a potato masher on the broccoli mixture and it worked perfectly.  Love it, and bet it will be even tastier by suppertime.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I loved this soup.  I just made it today and had to say how delicious this was.  
Hubby has a horrible cold right now and hasn't eaten much for a few days so I decided to make something that was easy and still use up the broccoli aging in the crisper.  

I had all the ingredients, even though I used 4 different cheddar cheeses.  After tasting at the end it simply tasted as though it needed a little extra sharp cheddar.  

I ate 1-1/2 bowls and my husband ate 2 bowls and watched me as I put the remaining 2 cups in the refrigerator.  LOL  Oops!  Almost forgot!  I only used 4 Tb. of flour because I don't like soup super thick and chopped the broccoli very coarsely.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe, caramommy.

Absolutely fantastic!  I too, used chicken broth instead of the granules and water but that was the only change made.  Definitely a keeper.  :-)

So easy and super delicious. Added some cajun seasoning for some zing.

I would probably rate this 4.5 stars if that were a choice. It is really decadent.

Yum! I added extra cheese and doubled the recipe. I also used butter and not margarine.  A little salty, maybe would be better with unsalted butter.  I will difinitely keep this recipe though!

SOOOO good. Probably the best broccoli cheese soup I've tasted. I used Gouda instead of cheddar cheese because its what I had on hand. I definitely recommend this recipe.
