I normally won't review a recipe unless I follow it to a T, but since this one hadn't been rated, I thought I would let others know it is really good. I was a little dubious, myself, and only chose this recipe because I could make it work with what I had on hand. My changes were modest: I didn't have any green onions, garlic, jalapenos, or sour cream so I  substituted with regular onions, garlic powder, bottled hot sauce, and plain yogurt. I didn't have enough cornmeal, so I wound up using a cornmeal/flour mix. I liked these a lot and think they would be even better if I hadn't made so many substitutions. I didn't make a sauce, but next time I will. I'll probably try the cilantro-lime mayonnaise from the crab and noodle cakes with cilantro lime dressing on this site.

I LOVE these tuna cakes!! We have made them at least 5 times and every time they come out perfect.   I didn't have cornmeal so I used seasoned bread crumbs, added more garlic & used frozen shredded zucchini from the summer crop. When using frozen zucchini I used 2 cups - it thaws & juices seep out reducing down to 1 C.   Don't let the jalapenos scare you off. My kids didn't know they were in there and asked for thirds. The recipe makes enough for us to eat two meals & great for leftovers.   I'm going to try and sub out salmon next time for the tuna.

This might actually be a 5 star recipe but I did not have several of the ingredients on hand.  The tuna cakes turned out to be very delicous even though I didn't include the green onions, jalapeno peppers, cottage cheese, sour cream, lime juice or cornmeal.  I did add about 3 tsps of lemonade and 1 shredded carrot.  I was worried that they would turn out dry because of the missing ingredients but that wasn't the case at all!  I had to bake them slightly longer, added about 10 mins to the bake time.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious. I had grilled the veggies called for the night before w/ the exception of the green onions. I rough chopped those veggies and then put them in my small food processor. I used panko vs bread crumbs for both the filling and for dipping. I was surprised how good the lime was in this. I made huge patties which turned out crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. 

I made a mayo, sour cream and lime sauce w/ fresh chives, parsley and cilantro. Also added kosher salt and fresh pepper and just a tiny bit of basil. My family loved this sauce along w/ the tuna cakes. I did have to cook mine about 20 minutes longer then stated but as I said they were huge. No left-overs....Darn. lol. Enjoy and make your own sauce with these. It's great!

Wonderful recipe!  Cheap and it makes a ton of yummy food.  The spicy pepper gives these tuna cakes a subtle kick.  I didn't use sour cream and the dish still turned out great.  I baked them a little longer because I like crispy things, nice and soft in the inside though.  Enjoy with with hot sauce on the top!  We're excited to eat the left-overs.  :)  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good... I chose this recipe because it wasn't fried and is low in fat.  I thought they were really good and tasted a little like crab cakes.  They were good with cocktail sauce.  I also added Old Bay and a little cayenne.

Yummy, my hubby couldn't get enough!  Used saltines instead of breadcrumbs, shake-n-bake/corn meal mix for crust, and fat free yogurt instead of sour cream.

These were a nice change to the way we usually have tuna and I liked the fact that they were a tweak to the usual crab cake. My modifications were to use bread crumbs; both plain and some with Italian seasonings and I didn't have bell pepper so I used chopped celery instead. I also left out the cottage cheese. I also browned them on a griddle sprayed with Pam/Olive oil and only used bread crumbs to coat then additional Pam spray to keep them moist while baking. My total bake time was close to 30 minutes and they turned out nice and brown but still moist on the inside. This recipe is very versitle and easy to lighten up if you need that option. Sauces are easy to add, we liked the chipotle cheddar and of course my husband used ketchup and crackers. Great appetizer or mid day meal. Thanks for sharing it.

I really like this recipe--it is super flexible and very forgiving! I use panko crumbs, exclude the jalapeno (husband not a fan), use regular cottage cheese and sour cream, substitute lemon juice for lime, and when I didn't have a zucchini I used frozen spinach. I use a couple of big spoons to form the patties and then flatten them a bit on the baking sheet and skip the cornmeal.  They make a tasty and easy meal, with plenty left over for lunch the next day. I like to mix a little sour cream with curry powder as a sauce for mine; my husband likes his with ketchup. Ketchup?!? Ketchup. But that's part of the flexibility I like with this recipe--satisfies both of our tastes with no extra effort.

Delicious!!! I never review anything if I have tweaked it as THAT is not an accurate review to what is posted. I didn't change anything and they were very yummy. 

As a side note: I gave it four stars because I will tweak it next time. I will probably do bread crumbs or panko instead of cornmeal and maybe throw in some Dijon. And something for crunch inside. But they were delicious.

These are real tasty. I couldn't figure out the perfect sauce pairing though. And I did have a problem with getting the outside crisp. By other reviewers suggestions, I tried browning them in a pan before going in the oven but the cornmeal seemed to make to thick of a crust. Perhaps using panko or regular breadcrumbs instead of cornmeal will give it that thin crispness it needs.

These were absolutely the best tasting fish cakes I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly but used 2 teaspoons of jalapeno pepper for added flavour. The heat was not noticable. I made 12 patties out of the recipe which meant each patty was 153cals. Moist and delicious with great texture. Bravo!

I don't know what I did wrong, but came out bland, dry and crusty/crunchy.  Had high expectations that weren't met.

These were the best tuna cake I ever had. I followed the recipe to the letter and added the cilantro-lime mayo like another reviewer.
They were very good, my wife who is not a big tuna fan even went back for seconds. The next day we made sandwiches with the leftovers and they were great. --dmevans4

While I was having some trouble with the consistency of the batter as I was trying to make the patties (the only reason this is not 5 stars), this was delicious. I keep Kosher and don't eat shellfish (which is the only thing I miss but not enough to break), so this was very happy to my tastebuds. My boyfriend gave his thumbs-up approval to make this again.

These were a delicious treat for dinner tonight, and with a few tweaks to my low sodium diet they were especially yummy! 

I left out the salt, jalapeno, and zucchini and doubled down on the green peppers (and added yellow too) and onion. I substituted my own yogurt ranch dressing for the cottage cheese and the sour cream. It turned out VERY good, especially with a honey mustard sauce (zero sodium natural mustard!).

Excellent recipe, I followed it exactly except I didn't have the sour cream.  Very tasty, filling, and good for folks trying to limit their fat and sugar intake.  I'm anxious to try this with crabmeat and old bay seasoning for crab cakes.

Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great. Kids loved it - bonus! The consistency of my mixture was very wet as I dropped 1/4 Cup sized balls into the egg mixture, then into the corn meal. Could have easily over breaded these things if I had done anything more than gently flip then once, trying to maintain the form of a 1/4 Cup sized crab cake. Glad I didn't - they had a slightly crispy outside and soft on the middle - more like a salmon croquet in consistency than a crab cake but still delicious! A nice, healthy and delicious dish!

Made the recipe as directed.  Pretty good.  Will probably make it again with the following tweeks:  Will omit basil completely or reduce to just 1/2 tsp. or 1/4 tsp.  1 Tbs basil is way too much for my family's taste.  Will roll finished "cakes" in panko bread crumbs rather than corn meal.  Corn meal seemed to make the "cakes" heavy and a little dry.  A touch of Old Bay seasonings will be added next time too. Recipe did not indicate whether or not to "drain" excess moisture from the zucchini. I did, and I think it was a mistake to do so.  The moisture of the zucchini is needed to keep the "cakes"  from being too dry.  I baked the "cakes" 20 min. per side.  Will reduce the baking time to 15 min. per side. Over all, this was a tasty recipe. Really reminiscent of crab cakes. Good with or without tartar sauce.  They were even better later on in the evening, as a snack.  Will try to adjust the recipe to make 1/2 of the quantity, as the original recipe makes quite a lot, around 23 "cakes" using the 1/4 cup measure. Thanks for sharing it.
