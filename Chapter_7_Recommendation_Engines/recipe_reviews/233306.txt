This soup is fantastic!  Even my pickiest eaters really enjoyed it.  It's hearty and flavorful.  I didn't have mixed veggies so I just used corn and it was still delicious.  I wasn't sure about the ginger but it adds a fantastic flavor!  I will be adding this to my regular rotation!

This is such a flavorful soup! I wasn't sure I'd like the ginger, but it really added to the flavor. The only pasta I had was vermicelli noodles, so I broke those up instead of using small shells. For the vegetables, I used about a 1/2 cup each of frozen corn and peas. I was out of garbanzo beans, so I used white kidney beans instead. After I took my picture, I added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese, and it was delicious! I'll definitely make this again.

I really loved this soup and would eat it again and again. It was relatively quick and easy to make with pre-made meatballs in the freezer. My family was less fond of it, but 2 out 3 of them liked it well enough.

Changes: I added a bit more onion (I didn't think ¼ c. was enough) and sautéd it with the garlic in a bit of olive oil instead of some broth. (I only had bouillon cubes on hand, so I had to wait until after I boiled the water to dissolve it, and I didn't want to do that all in a separate pot just so I could have a bit to sauté onions and garlic in). I didn't have canned Italian tomatoes on hand, so I used regular and added 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I also used frozen mixed veggies (green beans, yellow beans, and carrots) since I didn't have canned. I used penne since I didn't have shells. I was worried penne would be too big, but it was fine. I was also worried that 2 tsp. of ginger would be too much, but I gave it a try, and it was good. Finally, I skipped the cilantro since hubby won't eat it.
