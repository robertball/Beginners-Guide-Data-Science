Nice recipe, but I'm giving it four stars cause of the changes I made. I read that some found the peanut butter taste was bland on its own and one said the bread was dry and crumbly. I made the following changes to the recipe and it came out nice and moist with a peanut butter taste that makes it good to have on it's own. I used 1 heaping cup of peanut butter, used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 cup and used the other half in sour cream and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  It resulted in a tasty, moist bread. Thanks for the recipe idea!

This is definately a bread that's based on personal preference.  I took a bite of mine, and asked my fiance if he wanted the rest.  I can't put my finger on what was wrong, but I just didn't like it.  he thought it was really good.  So worth a shot to make!

Although I didn't think it tasted much like peanut butter, the pro's far outweighed this small con.  The pro's being: very simple ingredients that you always have on hand, and it being a delicious, dense, moist bread.

I'd planned to freeze 1/2 the loaf, but ended up eating the entire loaf within a few days. Went great with some honey drizzled on top and a cup of tea on the side; with butter and coffee in the morning; with blackberry jam and a glass of milk for an afternoon snack.  My friend even smushed up a ripe banana and spread that on her slice of bread. 

A great basic bread that you can dress up with just about any imaginable topping.

This bread is sooo cool. Just top it off with Jam and you have a less sticky and very yummy pb & j sandwich. I used light crunchy peanut butter and it is really good. My husband thought it was really good too. next time I might try it with bananas and have peanut butter and banana sandwich loaf. Thanks! Anna

My kids like this with PB&J.  My husband thought it was great plain with coffee.  Me personally thought it was a little bland, but I believe it is made to be eatten with something on it.

Will make it again for sure.

Like a cookie/bread.  Took advice from other member by substituting 1/2 cup of milk for 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Yummy and moist!

This is very dry and the peanut butter flavour is fairly mild.  It almost NEEDS something on top to moisten it which is not what I look for in a dessert loaf.  Bakes up fine, it's easy, but is very heavy (dense).  Not one I will make again.

At first I could barely taste the peanut butter.  By the second day I couldn't taste it at all!  I ended up throwing it out.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Good, a bit dry, so we heated up the slices in the toaster oven.

Just made this recipe. I added 1 cup of peanut butter as suggested, also was going to use the sour cream but was out and had some buttermilk i wanted to use up so did 1/2c milk and 1/2 c buttermilk also brown sugar instead of white sugar .When reading some of the reviews people said it was bland so put a ribbon on strawberry jam in the middle. It still is just ok. Dont think i would make it again. If so i would try banana or chocolate chips added and see how that goes.

It was ok as per recipe but was even better with the suggestion of one reviewer who used half cup milk and half cup sour cream. I used low fat milk, low fat sour cream, sub white sugar for brown sugar and added a tsp of vanilla. The result was a dense, moist and deeeeelicious bread. Ty for the inspiration!

This recipe is wonderful! I am a huge peanut butter fanatic and this bread makes the best peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I've ever tasted. The kids have asked for it every day.

I did follow another reveiwer and up the peanut butter to 1 cup and I added a tsp of vanilla. And I've never owned a pastry blender, so I did the old fashioned trick of cutting through it with 2 knives.

My mom made this and the first time it didn't turn out well, but she simply stirred the peanut butter into the flour mixture, the second time she used the knife method and it came out perfect.

This recipe definitely smells good while in the oven, but I won't be making it again. You can barely taste the peanut butter in it, and it is very crumbly and dry.
