Simply delicious. I browned the tenderloin in olive oil in a cast iron skillet, and didn't bother roasting it in a different pan. While it was in the oven I sauteed some petite button mushrooms, and added them to the finished sauce which I prepared, with a couple of cloves of minced garlic, once the roast was out of the oven and resting.  Koalagirl, you've outdone yourself!

This is an excellent, very tasty dish!         Definitely one of the best pork dishes on this website. The Dijon Marsala sauce is simply amazing! However, I would not coat the pork tenderloin with Dijon mustard before browning the pork in a skillet; simply brown the pork tenderloin as is before putting it in the oven. Adding lemon pepper on top of the browned pork before inserting it in the oven might be  an option.  For the Dijon Marsala sauce, I would cut the amount of heavy cream by half since there was lots of sauce left.  As I didn't have Marsala wine, I substituted it with sherry and it turned out absolutely great.  Next time, I will included half a cup of chopped mushrooms to the Dijon Marsala sauce, which incidentally, compliments pork tenderloin very well.  I do not see the Dijon Marsala sauce for chicken or steak; this sauce is made for pork only.  I will definitely make this dish again!

Would rate this higher than 5 stars.  Sauce is of restaurant quality.  I cooked a 2 l/2 lb. loin of pork roast - while that was resting after cooking I made the sauce, sauteing mushrooms, scallions and garlic (didn't have shallots).  When the mushrooms, etc. were tender I removed them and continued making the sauce.  When sauce was finished I added the mushrooms back to sauce to heat up.  The amount called for was perfect for this size roast - fed four of us.  Served with mashed potatoes.  This is very rich so I would suggest a light vegetable - like asparagus, peas, green beans.  Thanks so much submitter - this is a keeper!!!

Oh my goodness, was this ever good! The sauce was incredible. During the last ten minutes of browning, I too added fresh mushrooms and instead of transfering the meat to a baking dish I just put the skillet right in the oven. Once done, I took the meat out to rest and then made my sauce in the same pan. This really added a lot of flavor to the sauce. I used fat free half and half and some seasonings and it still tasted rich and delicious. If your skillet's handle is not oven proof, just wrap the handle with aluminum foil and it'll be fine. Thanks so much Koalagirl for a lovely dish that's certainly company worthy!

Fabulous...simply fabulous. I replaced the shallot with onion because that's what I had, and I don't think it made much of a difference. I also sprinkled Kosher salt and black pepper on the tenderloin before schmeering on the dijon. I think the key to this dish is remembering that there are two types of Marsala. Use the Sweet Marsala and you'll end up with creamy Golden Griddle pancake syrup! I only use Dry Marsala and the flavor of each dish really comes through. This dish was no exception. It's been a long time since I considered a sauce good enough to be a beverage! :-}

I made this for Easter and I was very pleased with the results.  Whenever I see Dijon mustard in a recipe I do tend to get leary that the sauce will taste more like mustard than anything else, but this recipe goes far beyond hiding behind a strong condiment!  Very well rounded flavors in the sauce truly complement the pork. Like other reviewers, I waited for the last 20 minutes of roasting to begin the sauce. I highly recommend using shallots as the recipe specifies - while onions are similar, I believe shallots are the best with cream sauces.  I served the sauce on the side for the benefit of the younger members of the family for whom the sauce was too rich.  All in all, this recipe goes in the "keeper" pile!  Thanks!

This was a wonderful and delicous recipe! Everyone liked it. I added crimini mushrooms and substituted shallots with onion. The tenderloin cooked in the time suggested but the slight problem that I had was that my sauce thickened very quickly. Next time I'm going to wait till the last 10 mins or so to make the sauce. Thx for the great recipe!

Very tasty!  My husband and I thought this was fabulous, and our 4 year old and 2 year old girls ate every bite too.  I added sliced baby bella mushrooms when I sauteed the shallots.  They definitely added a lot to the sauce.  My only other substitution was to use half and half instead of the heavy cream (all I had).  It still made for a very rich sauce.  For some reason, my pork didn't take quite as long as called for in the recipe, but I always use a digital meat thermometer anyway so that I don't have to worry about cooking times.  I served this over egg noodles with a side of broccoli, and my whole family agreed this was one of our new favorite meals.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Another five-star rating! A friend and I made this together and it turned out delicious. Her suggestion to use dry marsala instead of sweet was right on. The sauce turned out amazing with a mellow, subtle taste. We added mushrooms, which gave it an extra dimension of flavor and a nice texture. Served it on organic whole wheat couscous with a side of fresh steamed asparagus and a bottle of pinot grigio. Superb!

This is a great recipe.  I use about half the amount of shallot and add a clove or two of minced garlic.  

This Marsala sauce is also VERY good or grilled filet mignon.  Trust me.

Blissful tasting!  Made this for a dinner perfect of 8 last night and every single person requested the recipe (even those who are afraid of the kitchen).  I did deviate and added garlic while I sauteed the shallots and added a variety of diced mushrooms to the finished sauce.  This recipe was outstanding!

Made this for company on the weekend.  Definite awesome and a 5 star.  My friend is a world traveller and 6 star cruiser - she said it was as good as anything she has had.  I actually browned my meat in the morning and made the sauce - I added extra shallots and garlic plus cremini mushrooms.  I actually think the sauce was better having been made early and in the fridge all day until I reheated to serve.  I was able to enjoy my company since I only needed to cook the meat while I did my veggies, etc.  This will definitely go in my entertainment book.  Always looking for recipes that can be made ahead so don't need to spend time in the kitchen when my guests arrive.

OH MY GOODNESS....THIS IS ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY PHENOMENAL!!!! YUM! YUM! YUM!  This is my second time making it, and it tasted even better than the first time!!  I followed other suggestions by adding fresh garlic and baby bella mushrooms to the shallots, and I also did not add the mustard directly to the pork before browning.  I just threw some salt and pepper (because the sauce is so good, it does not need other seasonings), and then browned it in olive oil.  I also did all the browning, baking, and sauce making in a cast iron skillet like "naples" suggested.  What a fabulous idea!  Made for easy clean up, while flavoring the sauce so wonderfully!!  The pork was tender and juicy, and the sauce.....oh the sauce!!  You may want to lick the plate when you're done!!"  The whole family loved it!  Thank you Koalagirl!!  I will be making this for many years to come!! (and thank you to all of you for your suggestions!)

This is a good recipe and works well! Only variation I make is that for added flavour, I use Coconut Oil (specially with Pork) which we now use in the restaurant on most things. Also suggest that cooks get to know their oven. A 350F preheated oven top third provides higher heat than same oven bottom third shelf level. Enjoyed this with a nice Zinfandel.

Wow!  I am so impressed with this recipe!  It was absoloutly delicious and very easy.  When my mother in law saw what I was cooking she said she felt like she was in a fancy restaurant.  I sauteed some mushrooms before browning the pork and set those aside.  I prepared the marsala sauce when the pork had about 15 minutes left to cook.  I added the mushrooms to the sauce and let it simmer and thicken.  This is without a doubt the best recipe I've gotten on the website, and I've used a lot.  It is my new favorite!!!!

Love this recipe and have been making it for a long time.  I sometimes make it with Vermouth instead of Marsala and it still comes out great!

As a side note to the earlier reviewer "Mary"...if you don't like the fat count, then don't make it...you are not the calorie police!!!!!

This is an excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing! The key to making a restaurant quality marsala sauce is the combination of sweet and dry wine, in equal amounts. Restaurants don't want you to know that.

We made this for Christmas dinner and were a bit disappointed. We had to triple the recipe for a crowd, so the ingredients got a bit pricy for a mediocre result. We added the "baby bellas" (which are actually crimino mushrooms) and a bit of garlic, as well as kosher salt and pepper. The sauce took a long time to reduce (partially due to tripling the recipe). The end result was pretty bland and a bit too sweet. All in all, not worth it.

This might have been as great as everyone rated it, but the ingredient list wasn't specific enough. It didn't say what size the pork should be so my cooking time took twice as long (3.5lb tenderloin) and the sauce didn't hold up well while waiting for the pork to finish. It separated and wouldn't combine when I tried to reheat it. It also didn't specify sweet or dry Marsala. When I tasted the sauce (before I had to throw it out because of the separation) it was too sweet. I served the pork with honey mustard mixed with dijon mustard, and everyone seemed to like it. I think the problems would have been avoided if the ingredient list had been more detailed.

Tastes like something from a restaurant.  Seriously.  I used about 1/4 of a tenderloin since I was the only one around who ate pork.  If it's just two people, 1/2 of a tenderloin should do.  Use a whole one for 3 people or more.....or a house with greedy teenagers, athletes and men who put buffets out of business.  I seasoned the tenderloin how I like to season meat, browned it THEN added the dijon mustard before putting in oven.  The store didn't have shallots so I just used half an onion but will make again using the shallots.  Make sure to keep stirring shallots/onion on medium or medium-low heat and add butter as necessary so they don't brown.  Added sliced baby bella mushrooms once minced onion became soft.  I doubled the sauce, took some of that liquid and put it into a bowl, stirred in some flour for thickening because I hate runny sauces/gravies and added it back to the skillet.  Great all the way through!!!

Wow.  This sauce is so simple and yet so good.  I didn't have time to cook in the oven so I just cut the pork into medalions and sauteed them, took them out, made the sauce then returned the pork and basted with the sauce.  I bet this would be good with mushrooms added too.

I used boneless pork chops, added mushrooms, but followed the sauce recipe to the letter.  Excellent.  Husband could not stop raving.  I used regular cooking marsala.

AMAZING! I discovered this recipe on here a year or two ago and it has become a staple meal in our home. Simple enough to make for just my husband and I but also has great potential for a beautiful presentation for dinner guests! Try it... you won't be sorry! The sauce is so good you'll stand over the stove eating it all by itself!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe....& it didn't disappoint!  Made the tenderloin as stated, took it out of the oven & started on the sauce while it rested.  Used what i had on hand, onion instead of shallots & marsala cooking wine (next time i will use marsala wine)...also added mushrooms.  Make sure you let it simmer to develop the flavors and let it reduce by half.  The bf loved this one & said i was awesome!!  soooo easy will definitley make this again!

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the sauce alone. The sauce is so good, I'll be making it by itself. Thanks, Koalagirl!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I did one thing different to save some calories :) Instead of using one whole cup of heavy cream, I put 3/4 of a cup of light cream and 1/4 cup of skim milk. It turned out fabulous! The pork was very tender and really didn't even need a knife. I Served the pork with rice, and green beans. Great recipe!!!

Oh My God this is delicious.  I just made this dish for dinner, and the sauce is awesome.  The meat tastes great even without the sauce.  The dijon mustard on the meat before searing makes all the difference in the world.  My boyfriend thought we should try the sauce with chicken the next time I make it.  The only change I made was that I added a few cloves of garlic to the sauce.  Thank you so much, Koalagirl.  This is a real keeper.

With some tweaking, this can be five stars. Good base recipe.  I found that trying to brown the pork with the mustard resulted in more steaming in the stove top pan than browning.  Next time (like I believe others have recommended) I will brown it first without the mustard - maybe dry it with paper towel, rub on a little salt and pepper, brown it in the oil, and THEN brush on the mustard before placing in the oven. I also found the cooking time to be way too long! I used 2.75 lb total weight for the 2 tenderloins. I felt it was over cooked using the stated timing. Luckily pork tenderloin is very forgiving, and it was still excellent. I think a higher temperature (to brown the mustard on it in the oven) for quite a bit less time is the way to go. I also took the suggestion of others and added in a 8oz pkg of mushrooms (16 oz probably would be even better) sautéed in the pan in butter before adding the shallots. Then added 3 cloves minced garlic. (It was the perfect amount! -about 1 tbls minced. It's not too much!) There was no mention of resting the meat and the wonderful oven pan juices! I removed pork to a platter to rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. I poured all of the oven pan juices into to cream sauce, and reduced it further. I then deglazed the oven pan with some of the sauce and added it back in.  I think these changes improve what is already a great recipe. - My opinion :)

My 11 yo asked me to give this 10 stars. Even my 5 yo liked it and asked for more sauce on hers. I used a semi-dry Madeira wine (what I had) and 35% cream, though I only used 1/2 cup wine to 1 cup cream. 2 Tbsp Dijon in the sauce (gotta get my glasses checked, I guess!) but in fact that was perfect for us. I also forgot to slather the mustard on the pork; I just used pepper on the meat during cooking. Plus following another reviewer's idea, I used the same skillet to make the sauce as the meat rested. Anyway it was grand and we all decided this is a definite keeper! Company-worthy, tastes fancy-schmancy, but so simple to prepare, you can actually enjoy your company when you serve this dinner. I'll probably be using this recipe over the holidays when the big family comes over. Thanks Koalagirl! :)

Made with chicken.  Very good but it takes a long time to reduce the sauce.  Perhaps using less cream would work better.

I made this last night for dinnner, husband and I both loved it! I did add a couple of extras, (personal preference) I sauteed 2 large chopped garlic cloves with the onion, alittle extra dijon, slightly less marsala and ground black pepper. Excellent sauce, Thanks Shar!!

Fabulous recipe! I seared my tenderloin before coating w/ mustard as I feared the mustard would burn & I only made one tenderloin. I made no other changes to the recipe although next time I think I'll add a bit of garlic (I add garlic to nearly everything LOL). I served this w/ parsleyed egg noodles (the sauce was just OK on the egg noodles), steamed snow peas, fresh rolls & Apple Crisp with Cranberry Sauce for dessert. Thansk KoalaGirl, we thoroughly enjoyd it!

Pork tenderloin is always a great meat due to its cut.  This recipe, however, lacks flavor.  I won't make this again as there are simply too many other great recipes for this tender meat.  At a minimum, adding thyme or rosemary would help this recipe.

This is an exquisite recipe. Full of wonderful flavor, and each ingredient shines in the final product. I rubbed a three pound pork half loin with salt and fresh ground pepper, followed with a coat of Dijon (perhaps 2 Tbsp).  Into the smoking hot Dutch oven it went and browned in olive oil.

After fully browned, I put in the oven at 350, and roasted about 45 minutes total, which yielded a beautiful medium rare to medium cook. While it rested on a cutting board, I made the marsala sauce in the Dutch oven and added sauteed button mushroom halves and green onions.

The finished product was plated with roasted garlic mash and lemon parsley green beans. My wife was absolutely cooing with pleasure. This is one of the best recipes on the site!

Restaurant caliber. Fabulous! My in-laws raved about it. This is the second time I've made it, and this time turned out better because I used a different Marsala (Taylor) that was neither sweet, nor dry. I patted dry the pork with a paper towel then generously salted and peppered it before slathering it with mustard (did not measure) and browning in a cast iron skillet. I'm not usually crazy about mustard in my dishes, but it's great in this one. The mustard-leavings in the pan were wonderful in the sauce. I made 1-1/2 times the sauce because it's so amazing. I added 2 cloves of garlic in with the shallots, and after reducing the sauce, I added 1-1/2 Tablespoons of fresh thyme. Mushrooms would have been good, but I forgot to buy them. I spooned some sauce over the meat in the serving dish and put the rest in a gravy boat so that people could get all they wanted. I served with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. The sauce is not great on top of the potatoes but I still like this dish with potatoes. To the reviewers who said this dish lacked flavor - I'd suggest adding more mustard to the pork, and plenty of salt & pepper is important too. Thank you, KoalaGirl!

I thought this was absolutely delicious & so simple to put together!  I too did not have shallots, but substituted sauteed fresh garlic, which was a wonderful addition.  This was even delicious cold out of the fridge the next day.  Thank you for a wonderful new way to enjoy pork tenderloin!

This was so, so good.  I cooked the pork tenderloin using the cooking method and bread crumbs from "Easy and Elegant Pork Tenderloin" and made the sauce in the same pan where I browned the meat.  I added a clove of minced garlic because we are garlic lovers but otherwise made the Dijon Marsala sauce as stated in the recipe.  I used a dry Marsala wine.  This entire recipe took me about 20 minutes of prep time and time checking on it while cooking but tasted like I spent hours on it.  This is a keeper!

Easy and fabulous tasting. I served this with those little purple, red, and yellow potatoes cooked in chicken stock and then slightly browned in butter. Also had a side dish of peas. Yum!  I followed another reviewer's comment and browned the pork, then smeared with mustard before baking. I cannot think of a single thing I'd change about this delightful dish.

This was excellent.  I messed with the sauce a bit because I wanted lots of it.  I added mushrooms in with the shallots, then added a bit of flour  after they were cooked (always let flour cook for a min. before adding any liquid), then some chicken stock with only 1/2 C of the marsala and the dijon and cream (used low fat half n half).  Let it all simmer for about 15 min. and it was incredible.  This is a wonderful recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The sauce was good and flavorful.  I did change it a bit.  I rubbed the tenderloin with a garlic, olive oil, fresh rosemary and fresh tyme mix before rubbing with dijon.  The we seared it as directed.  As far as the cooking time - I'm not sure because we just used my new stocking stuffer which is an oven proof thermometer.  Baked at 350 till it came up to 160.  It was perfectly cooked and moist and tender and the sauce complimented it very well!  Will make again.  At least the same oven temp and sauce!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really, really good!I followed the recipe exactly, *except* that I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and I added 4 ounces of sliced mushrooms to the shallots. I cooked the tenderloin using a meat thermometer, and it came out PERFECT! Tender, moist, and the sauce - like so many previous reviewers noted - was tasty without being overwhelming in its' 'dijon-ness'. (I served with stir-fried broccoli, as we watch our carbs.) I am adding this to my 'company' pile of recipes - Thanks!!

Excellent pork!  I didn't make the sauce since we didn't want to have sauce with the meat but the pork tasted excellent.  My husband RAVED about it. Very juicy.  The one thing I see wrong with the recipe is that it doesn't tell you how many pounds.  I used a 2 1/2 lb tenderloin and it took an hour and 45 minutes to reach 165 degrees.  After the 40 minutes I checked the temp and I could tell by inserting the thermometer that it was still raw in the middle.

The basic recipe is great - I made the following changes: used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of pork, 2 tbsp butter substitute instead of butter, 1 small onion instead of shallots, 1 tbsp marsala and 1 cup chicken broth instead of just marsala.  
Awesome!

This recipe is extremely forgiving of substitutions.  I didn't have any dijon mustard so I used Gulden's.  Didn't have shallots, so I used garlic.  Didn't have marasala wine so I used chardonnay.  Didn't have heavy cream so I used light cream.

The pork I had was sliced rather thinly so I baked it for only about 25 minutes total (15 and then 10).  Then I took the meat out of the baking disk and added the pan drippings to the sauce.

And yes, the sauce went very well over broccoli.

I tasted the sauce from time to time, as one does when cooking.  In the beginning it tasted rather funny, or somehow wrong.  But as time went on and the sauce aged and mixed together, it came to taste good.  Give it all the time it needs to thicken!

I made this for a luncheon for about 25 people, so I had to quadruple the recipe.  I used pork loins instead of tenderloin, so I definitely had to increase the cooking time.  While cooking the shallots, I added in 8 cloves of chopped garlic.  The sauce reduction also took much longer due to the increased volume, but the sauce was delicious.  I used only the Marsala wine, and the flavor was slightly sweet and very rich.  I added 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley to the sauce to add color.  My guests ate every last morsel!

I thought this was okay, but my husband literally spit it out, and he's NOT a picky eater. I was surprised at his reaction. Maybe he doesn't like Marsala wine? We couldn't pin down what it was about it that he didn't like, but that's my guess.

OMG this was delicious! I added baby bellas and a couple cloves of minced garlic as recommended by others. I can't say enough about how good this was and the friends I served it too agreed it was fabulous. I will definitely be making this again.

Yum! SERVE WITH PRETZEL ROLLS AND SAUERKRAUT! Followed recipe pretty much perfectly except I used a couple chops instead of loin chunks and didn't bother with the continue cooking in stove part since the chops cook through fast.  The pretzel rolls are perfect for sopping up the extra sauce!  Will make again with some additions...

THIS IS AN EXELLENT AND EASY RECIPE.  HUBS LOVED IT AND IT COULD BE SERVED TO COMPANY.  THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS THE COOKING TIME.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERCOOK.  I USED A THERMOMETER AND TOOK IT OUT AT 145 AND LET IT SIT FOR 5 MINUTES FOR PINK IN THE MIDDLE.  THIS TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES ALLTOGETHER.  IT ALSO DEPENDS HOW THICK YOUR TENDERLOIN IS.  ENJOY !

The sauce is to die for. Adding sauteed sliced mushrooms makes it even better.

This recipe is amazing... I have used it with grilled chicken breast but our favorite is breaded chicken breast as it holds the sauce on even more :) It is also good with pork chops. I have added mushrooms as it gives it a great flavor and texture and we usually have white or jasmine rice on the side because we love how it soaks up the sauce. I also add about a teaspoon of dried mustard to it to bring out the mustard flavor a little more.

Very tasty!  We made this a little differently than instructed in the recipe.  Hubs grilled the tenderloin completely, but without the mustard coating.  While it was being grilled and while it rested, I made the sauce as directed.  Because I hadn’t browned the pork in the pan, I didn’t have any browned bits to contribute flavor to the sauce, so I added the juices that had accumulated on the cutting board after carving.  I think that added a great amount of flavor and I would do that again.  I meant to add some garlic when making the sauce, but I forgot.  I thought the sauce could have used more Marsala flavor and less cream.  Hubs, on the other hand, thought it was perfect as is.  Based on that alone, I guess I will be making this again, but I will try to remember to add some garlic next time!

This was excellent.I coated one side of the pork and put face down in pan and then coated the other side.Easier to handle.The second time I made it I made it earlier in the day and reheated under lettuce leaves on serving platter. Perfect. The sauce is delicious.

Delicious!  Even my 3 picky eaters loved it!  I made a few changes based on other reviewers...  First, I put kosher salt and cracked pepper on the tenderloins before covering them in the dijon.  While that cooked, I sauteed the shallots then added about 10 chopped shitake mushrooms until all were tender.  The last minute or so I added one large clove of minced garlic.  I also only used 1 T. of butter and 1 T. of olive oil for sauteing (to save on fat and calories.)  I used a dry Marsala and 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  I don't think anyone missed the extra fat.  This was outstanding!

Very, very good. I use half & half instead of heavy cream to save calories... that is probably the reason why my sauce comes out a little thin, I plan on adding cornstarch next time to thicken it up a little. Out of the two times I've made this, the first time with the shallots & the second time without the shallots, we prefer it without. The sauce is delicious over steamed broccoli. We also enjoy mashed potatoes with this dish. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  I sauteed bella button mushrooms with the shallots, and I substituted half and half instead of cream, thickening it with a simple rue.  I also blended one egg yolk to prevent any separation.  Recommend DRY marsala vs. sweet.  It provides a more savory flavor.  After browning, use a meat thermom. and bring the pork to 155, let it rest for 10 minutes before carving.  If you cook two tenderloins, just tie them together with kitchen twine before browning.  It will cook as a single roast.  It was PERFECTLY cooked, with a slight pink center.

This is so good.  I have surplus of baby back ribs that I need to use up before I move, so I baked the ribs by itself until done.  I then made the sauce by itself.  I turned the rib pieces (bones off) in the sauce and served.

This is delicious.   I halved the recipe because I had one tenderloin.   I didn't have Marsala wine so I used white wine.  The sauce was fairly acidic this way (Marsala is much sweeter of course) so I threw in about a tablespoon of apricot jam to smooth out the flavors and correct the acidity.  Next time I will roast it at a higher temperature (shorter time) to give it more of a brown exterior.  I found that it didn't brown so much in my heavy skillet.  I guess that's because it's pretty wet with that mustard coating.  Still - it's a keeper and I encourage you to try it.    Delicious sauce!

Fabulously delicious! The dijon gives it a subtle kick. A few slight changed- added a can of sliced mushrooms with the marsala,(didn't have any fresh on hand), waited until it cooked down a bit before adding the cream. -  and I cut the tenderloin into 1 1/2 inch pieces, pounded them with a mallet to flatten into medallions, then coated both sides lightly with dijon and seared in the pan. This way cuts the cooking time and  IMO makes for a fancy presentation.    Yummy.  Fast and easy weeknight meal that could be served to company. Thanks koalagirl.

I followed this recipe with some exceptions:  I used  boneless pork chops instead of tenderloin and  added a pinch of salt and black pepper to the sauce.  My husband loved the sauce so much that he used bread to sop it up!  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks.

Wasn't sure I would like the marsala and dijon...I was SO wrong!  This was delicious and restaurant quality.  The only changes I made were to use half and half instead of creme and a sprinkle of fresh herbs on top for a splash of color.

My family really enjoyed.  The sauce was delicious.  I only used one shallot as it was pretty big and I did not want the onion to overpower the taste.  It turned out perfect.  Thank you.

I have prepared this recipe twice in the last month and Oh My God.....is it good!! My husband and I absolutely love this one.  It is easy to prepare and the kitchen smells wonderful when it is cooking. Serve with steamed green beans and a nice butternut squash risotto!  Divine!  It is in my "favorites" folder.

We have just finished eating this marvellous dish!  I made the fol changes.  Sub dijon for grainy mustard, heavy cream for skim milk w/cornstarch.  Omited oil, use nonstick frypan, brown meat THEN coat with mustard before roasting.  Suggest making sauce well in advance and then reheating for company to prevent standing at the stove for 30 minutes.

This is "lick the plate" good. I had no heavy cream, but still wound up with a delicious sauce. I had to substitute onion for the shallot, with no regrets. It is a potent sauce, in that a little goes a long way for flavor. I couldn't have drowned the pork in it. But wow! so yummy!

This pork tenderloin recipe was wonderful! Definitely 5 stars! I did a couple of things different (I can't seem to help myself). I browned and roasted the meat in the same pan, I just added a little water to the pan before putting the meat in the oven. When it was done, I deglazed the pan with a little water, poured that off and set it aside. Then I used the same pan for the shallots, and with them, I browned some garlic and mushrooms, then when the mushrooms started to squeak, I put in a tsp of tomato paste and the tablespoon of mustard, and let it brown just a tad. Then the wine and the deglazing liquid. I used fat-free half and half instead of cream. It came out wonderful! What a great recipe! Thanks, Koalagirl!

I made this for my husband's birthday dinner, and it got rave reviews from everyone, including the inlaws and the kids.  There were no leftovers, as several people went back for seconds.  This is definitely a keeper, and I will make it again.

Used fat free half and half.  Cooking instructions are perfect.  I put the thermometer in the meat when I took it from the oven and it was 160.  Let it sit about 10 minutes under foil.  Perfect!

The photo of this recipe does NOT do it justice.  It is absolutely delicious.  My husband can't stop talking about it.  Notes - I used finely chopped onion b/c I was out of scallions.  I also substited honey mustard for dijon.  It was terrific.  I also used a medium - sweet marsala.

This is a fantastic recipe- I modified the fat by using 1/2c milk and 1/2c half & half, rather than cream.  The flavor was great, even though I'm not at all a mustard fan.  YUM!

Excellent recipe.  First time prepared exactly as written, with outstanding results.  Second time, used chicken breasts--(seared in mustard, transferred to warm oven until sauce was prepared, then transferred back to skillet to continue cooking in sauce). Also added sauteed sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  Served with rotini, Balsamic Glazed Carrots from this site, and portabella cheddar foccacia bread.

This is a terrific recipe. I realized yesterday morning that all my tenderloin recipes required marinating overnight, yet the tenderloin I wanted to cook for last night's dinner was still frozen! I found this recipe, and am so pleased, because it does not require any marinade. I followed the directions exactly, except I used onions instead of shallots. I used half sweet marsala and half dry, as one reviewer recommended, but I think next time I will use all dry marsala. The entire family loved it, and I am looking forward to my lunch of leftovers!

I love this recipe. I really like to substitute the marsala for port wine. It makes a very rich and sweet sauce. You may need to add a little more cream to offset the sweetness with port. Also, mushrooms are a great addition to the sauce. Defiantly go with a crisp more bitter vegetable for the side. I like to serve it with Brussels sprouts. Sauteed in butter and tangerines.

Delicious!  I served this for Christmas dinner and it tasted like it came from a professional chef!  Lots of rave reviews!  I took one reviewer's advice and used 1 part chicken brother and 1.5 parts Marsala wine for the sauce.  It couldn't have been tastier!

This was fantastic.  I had a hard time getting the dijon to stick to the pork at first, but really slathered it on.  the sauce was super easy.  I added some baby bella shrooms like some others.  My husband loved it.  The kids ate the pork without the sauce.  Definitely a repeater!

This was so good!  The only changes I made was to add salt to the sauce and I used minced onions and garlic since I did not have any shallots.  The sauce was delicious and so easy to make.  My husband couldn't stop moaning while eating this meal!!  I will definately make this again!

Made this with cooking sherry and half and half cream instead of heavy cream, and it was restaurant- quality delicious! It was still too rich for us, but it sure tasted good going down. Like other reviewers, I didn't bother with mustard on the meat, but included it in the sauce,  added crimini mushrooms also. This is definitely a great company recipe - restaurant quality with minimal work. My sauce never did reduce a whole lot but this didn't seem to take away from the taste!

Wow!
We REALLY enjoyed it
We all ate way too much
Definitely restaurant quality. 
I pre-seared my meat in the morning so i wouldnt have to stink up the house while my guests would be here. I also put the mustard on the pork after i seared it. 
Served it with little baby potatoes and cinnamon carrots. 
DELICIOUS

Delicious! Used a generous portion of Dijon mustard on the meat to coat it. If you like mustard, you'll love this. Used onion and garlic in place of the shallots because I couldn't get them. Try it out!

I should have liked this.  It had all the ingredients for me to like it but it was awful!  I don't know if it was the lack of precise measurements or what type of ingredients were to be used but for me, and my husband, this was a disaster.  A 'cup' of something isn't helpful, grams or ml would be a better way to describe things, at least then we only have ourselves to blame if we go overboard, my 'cup' of Marsala wine was what killed it I think.  It was overpowering and made it totally unpalatable.  Or it might have been that it wasn't specified if it was sweet Marsala or dry and as I could only get sweet, I took a chance on that thinking that I had a 50% chance of being right.  Who knows if dry Marsala would have made it better but if I ever get up the nerve to try this again, I'd try it with dry and a smaller 'cup'.

The saving grace was that I didn't serve the sauce over the meat so we were able to still eat the meat, which was good.

Absolutely fs\abulous.  I've made this twice and it's so simple, flavorful and enjoyed by all.  I never have shallots in the house so I substitute with red onions and garlic.  The receipe doesn't indicate what size tenderloins to use.  I use one tenderloin about 1.5 to 2 pounds and put in a covered baking dish for optimum moistness of the pork.  To use more meat than this you should double, no TRIPLE the gravy, because it is delicious.

This recipe is a 5 star keeper.  I've made it for years and everyone loves it.  I read through others reviews and adapted it to our tastes and budget.  Most often I use a pork loin and cut it in half lengthwise. Keep in mind that if you use a pork loin you will need to double the baking time. I add mushrooms and minced garlic to the shallots.  I only use heavy cream in the sauce and I always double the sauce.  I use the less sweet type of marsala wine.  I coat with additional mustard after browning and sprinkle with white pepper.  I do this again after turning the loin.  I use a meat thermometer and after removing from the oven I cover it for ten minutes.  If the sauce isn't thick enough, I whisk in a tablespoon or two of cornstarch.  Perfect every time!  Thank You

Really great and simple meal that looks super fancy.  I was afraid that browning the pork tenderloin medallions would dry them out after baking, but they stayed tender and juicy!  Sauce is amazing!  A simple meal for entertaining (I added roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes) and fairly easy to make.

We loved the mustard Marsala sauce. Amazing flavor! I had to adjust the recipe a bit due to time constraints. I sprinkled lemon pepper (per advice on another review) on the tenderloin and rubbed some dijon mustard on it. Browned in a little olive oil in a cast iron skillet. I removed the tenderloin (wrapped it in foil and refrigerated it) and added about a cup of water to the skillet. I boiled the water and stirred it with a wooden spoon to loosen the droppings. I poured the water into a glass measuring cup and refrigerated it over night.  The next morning I put the tenderloin in a crock pot with a cup of water. Cooked on low for 8 hours. When I got home from work I mixed cornstarch in the measuring cup with the droppings from the night before and boiled it until it thickened. I added 1 TBS of butter and the shallots. I added the rest of the ingredients and boiled it for another 5 minutes. I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. I also threw some sauteed baby bella mushrooms in the gravy. This was delicious. Can't wait to make again!

Awesome recipe. I made it while sick added a little to much salt (was unable to taste) but it was still very good. Had it a few days later for left overs and OMG great meal making again today. This will be a staple in my house. Thanks for sharing

This - is - amazing. I mean, it is absolutely delicious. Tastes like it would be served in a restaurant! Just be careful not to over do the dijon in the sauce because it will easily overpower all of the other components of the dish...you can always add more so I would add it in slowly. Also, i sauteed mushrooms with the shallots and added some garlic before preparing the sauce....an absolute MUST..you nee the mushrooms in my opinion, but all in all...a great meal that is sure to impress!

EXCELLENT sauce!  This recipe is perfect.  Tenderloin comes out nice and pink and the combo with the marsala sauce is delicious!  I added about a half cup of mushrooms as well.  Will def be making this again.

This is the best sauce I have ever made.  I get rave reviews everytime I make it.  The meat turns out so tender every time.  Allrecipes emailed this to me 2 months ago and I have already made this dish 6 times and everytime I make it for someone they say it is the best they have ever had.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I am not much of a pork fan, but this was sensational.      I followed the recipe exactly, but would probably add sauted mushrooms with the sauce next time as others have done.   Great dish overall.   Even the kids loved it.

This was great!!! I added morel mushrooms because I had them on hand. I didn't rub the pork with mustard before baking (per other reviews).  The sauce is so flavorful.

Absolutely wonderful!  I may never use another recipe for pork tenderloin.  My hubby is not a pork fan; he said this is the best pork he's ever eaten.  I browned the tenderloin coated in Dijon, salt and pepper, along with the shallots and two cloves of garlic.  Then I added the wine and five sprigs of thyme and brought it to a simmer.  Baked covered for about 1 hour.  Add the mushrooms near the end.  I removed the meat, keeping it warm, added half and half and finished as directed. So good!  Only thing I will change next time is that I won't salt the meat. (An addition I made, but salty enough without added.)  Thanks for sharing!

We really loved this recipe.  Small change to the preparation method, since we were at the cottage in hot weather.  I lightly oiled the tenderloin and sprinkled with salt & pepper.  We grilled and when almost done, basted all around with dijon & BBQ'd until done.  I made the sauce in a sauce pan on the stove & served over the sliced tenderloin.  Delicious & I'll be making it for company this weekend.

Great recipe! I used a pork loin instead of a tenderloin which needed some extra time in the oven.  I also didn't have a full cup of Marsala wine so I used a splash of other good red wine.  Turned out delicious, my family was very impressed.

Delicious!  Rolled tenderloins in about 2 tsp kosher salt, mixed with 2 tsp garlic powder and refrigerated in plastic bag a couple of hours before browning.  Add 8 oz fresh mushrooms to shallots; saute before adding marsala and cream. Best pork loin ever!

My pork was a little over-cooked, but that was probably because of the size of my tenderloin.  I didn't rub the pork with the Dijon, just salt & pepper.  Sauce was good, but it must have reduced too much because there wasn't much of it (I also used skim milk because that's what I had on hand).  Husband really liked this despite my errors.

This was really good even though I didn't have all the right ingredients. I used evaporated milk instead of cream, spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, and white catawba wine instead of marsala. also used 1/2 c onion and 2 cloves garlic because I didnt have shallots. I guess you can't mess this up, Still great!

This was SO good!  I used light cream as it was what I had on hand and wanted to cut down on the fat content.  I also wisked in a couple tablespoons of light sour cream for a little extra bite.  Definitely worth saving and sharing!  Thanks!

We recently made this recipe for a large party and it was a hit. We used one of the giant pork loin roasts from the grocery store. Weighed about 5.5 lbs. It took about 1 1/2 hours on our bbq rotisserie until about 145 degrees. I seasoned the loin with salt and pepper before rubbing with dijon. I also let it sit over night. For the sauce I followed the recipe but after tasting the sauce it didn't have enough dijon so I added more. Excellent sauce!

I made this last night and it turned out great!  The only additional steps I took was I seasoned the tenderloin with salt and pepper and I added about a third of a cup of milk to extend the sauce so I had some extra for mashed potatoes.  The Dijon and Marsala flavors are evident but they pair nicely with the tenderloin and aren't too overwhelming.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Phenomenal!!!  I didn't have enough dijon to coat the pork loin before searing, but still this produced one of the juiciest and most flavorful tenderloins for me.  Loved everything about the sauce and won't hesitate to make it again.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I'm torn on how to rate this recipe.  We really enjoyed the pork coated with the dijon, and it was cooked perfectly.  As for the dijon marsala sauce, I thought it was OK, but DH didn't care for it at all.  I don't think we'll be repeating this recipe.

This is my new favorite dish!  I've made it twice and it has been great each time!  I added a package of sliced mushrooms that I sauteed before adding to the sauce because I love mushrooms.  I also used half n' half to lighten up the sauce a little.  Make sure you use a dry marsala, it really makes the dish.  I had to go to a large-ish liquor store to find this but I stocked up because I will be making this recipe often!  Next time I will probably double the sauce because there never seems to be enough.

If there was a higher rating than 5 stars this would be the first recipe I would give it to. I have to say I am not really a fan of pork at all, but my husband loves it so I have long searched for something I might enjoy and I've finally come across it. This really was a delightful dish, the quantities for the sauce were perfect. I smothered my pork with the Dijon and let it stand for a couple of hours before browning. I think it is key to make the sauce in the skillet that you brown the pork in and definitely do not omit the mustard on the pork stage before browning. Freshly ground black pepper on the finished result was lovely. It never ceases to amaze me how reviewers on this site change recipes or methods and then criticise the results. My husband said this was the best pork he has ever had - and he's had a lot!! Thank you Kolagirl for sharing - this is a classic keeper!

Really liked the sauce. I made this with two thick boneless pork chops, then sliced them and spooned the sauce over. Would have again - thank you!

Very good. I actually used a pork loin instead of pork tenderloin. Instead of frying in skillet, I just baked in the oven with olive oil for 1 1/2-2 hours.

would rate it higher if I could.  anything that makes my husband clean his plate is worth 10 stars to me.  i made a few modifications, but only because i didn't have certain ingredients and also wanted to make a lower fat version.  1. cut the recipe in half, since i only had one tenderloin and still had plenty of sauce.  2. did not rub the tenderloin with mustard before browning, simply because it would have made a sticky mess in the pan and i didn't think it was necessary.  3. used cooking sherry instead of marsala wine.  4. used fat free half and half instead of cream.  tasted fantastic!  served it with steamed asparagus and drizzled the sauce over everything.  will make this again and again.

OMG!  Thank you for such an easy and delicious dish!  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I'm recently married and had our in-laws and brother-in-law over.  Did this ever leave a good impression!  The only additions I made was that I marinated the pork with a little salt and pepper as well as rosemary (just a dash) and added mushrooms to the sauce as suggested by another reviewer.  I served with sauted fresh green beans (just over a pound for 5 people and sauted with 2 tsps of butter, salt and pepper to taste and about 2 tsps of garlic powder) and cous cous (spelling?) EXCELLENT MEAL!  I definitely think this will be our Christmas Eve meal here on out.

This was excellent. I did not have marsala wine, so I had to use port, since that was all I had on hand. I also substituted onions for the shallots. I just had one large tenderloin and the sauce was just the perfect amount. Thanks.

Ok...so I previously reviewed this dish but had to substitute chardonnay for marsala, which was very good.  Last night I made it according to the recipe, and it was by far the best dish I have ever made.  My boyfriend said it was delicious enough for any upscale restaurant to serve and is his new favorite dish.  Absolutely incredible!

This was outstanding!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used Evaporated Milk.  We loved the flavor and can't wait to make it again for company.

Delicious!  Made it last night for guests and they wouldn't leave without the recipe. I did saute cremini mushrooms along with the shallots, but other than that, wouldn't change a thing!

This was an excellent recipe. We added mushrooms as other reviews stated. We only used 15% cream, as heavy cream is a bit too high in fat. We have a recipe that is very similar to this: instead of the cream put 1 can beef consommé and add mushrooms. This is a good variation for lactose intolerant ppl.

OMG i was so sure about this, becuase sometimes i do not even like marsala, depending. but this was great. the pork was perfectly tender, and the sauce got better the more it sat out. i made it with roasted red potatoes (which i almost cook fully in microwave) then tossed with olive oil, fresh parsley, lots of garlic powder, a littel bit of crushed red pepper, salt & pepper. YUM. and with peas. This is a keeper, and ver impressive looking. Thanks.

A+++ recipe!  I made it exactly as written, except that the good angel over my shoulder must have nudged aside the bad angel at the grocery, because I ended up with light cream instead of heavy cream.  I outsmarted the good angel by adding an extra pat of butter to the sauce!!  I would make it the same way again, and I would definitely make this to impress guests.  Served  with whole wheat couscous and tender, fresh green beans cooked in chicken broth, this was an easy and delectable meal.

This turned out absolutely delectable and tender!  I followed the directions as-is, except that I used Green onions instead of scallops, Texas Red Wine instead of Marsala (I used what I had!), and I added a little extra Dijon mustard (for my hubby).  I LOVED the results!  Now that I think about it, I have some leftover in the fridge!  Dinnertime!

Rubbing the tenderloin with mustard seemed redundant, what with the sauce.  It would seem more beneficial to taste to use salt , pepper, thyme and mustard powder, while browning.  Otherwise a fantastic dijon mustard sauce is indeed present in this recipe.  Don't hesitate to make the sauce while the meat is resting for 10 minutes.

Only one word for this recipe-AWES
OME!! Made great wraps for the next day.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and Honey Ginger Carrots from this site.  I think I will add mushrooms to the sauce next go round.

Not my favorite, perhaps it was  the dry marsala I used. I'll attempt this one more time with sweet marsala and see if I notice a difference.

This was excellent.  I doubled the sauce, added some mushrooms and flour to thicken it up a bit.  Make sure you use real Marsala, cooking Marsala has a TON of salt in it, and will alter the flavor of the sauce.

Very good - especially since you don't even have to add any salt or pepper. I used pork loin so you definitely need to cook it longer but the sauce was yummy. Didn't have any marsala so I used sangiovese instead and it was fine, not sweet.

This was very good.  The only changes I made was sub onion for the shallots, since I had it on hand. I also added baby bella mushrooms to the sauce as others did. The sauce was good, but maybe I didn't let it cook long enough - the wine taste was very strong and very sweet!  I personally didn't care for it that much because of its sweetness (hubby didn't seem to mind) but I might do what another reviewer said...next time 1/2 marsala, 1/2 chicken stock.  It also didn't thicken up so I had to add a bit of cornstarch.  I asked hubby whether he thought this recipe or the "Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin" recipe from this site was better, and he couldn't decide, he liked both. I will keep experimenting with pork tenderloin recipes until we come to one we both love, but this recipe is definitely good.

This was excellent! The flavour was beautiful although a little too sweet for my husband. Next time I will use half marsala and half chicken stock to reduce the sweetness / richness. I added fresh chopped parsley to the finished sauce.

Ohmigod, this recipe is wonderful.  Sauce is perfect, my husband didn't even swallow before he exclaimed that it was wonderful.  I left out the shallots all together and replaced with garlic and sliced mushrooms; also used half the butter to saute.  Thank You - it's a definite keeper, good for company also.   Thanks for sharing.

WOW!!! I had to adapt because I only had honey dijon mustard & used butter & milk for the heavy cream that I didn't have.  We added mushrooms also & this is a keeper.  Very rich, but it was like eating at a fancy restaurant.

Excellent! Very easy and quick to prepare. Next time, I will use a pork tenderloin. This time, I used boneless pork loin (3) and reduced the recipe to serve three. This was my husband's and my Valentine's Day dinner. Served with some garlic scalloped potatoes. The sauce was great with the potatoes as well. This meal was a perfect match with a bottle of Palmeyer Merlot. Finished it all off with a chocolate genache cake.

We love this recipe!  I substituted chicken for pork and I added mushrooms just because I had them, but the Dijon and Marsala combined made a zesty new twist on the classic Marsala sauce.  Highly recommended!

I have been making this recipe for almost 2 years now and it NEVER disappoints.  Very few ingredients and the flavor is absolutely amazing.  I do like to add a little coarse sea salt and fresh ground pepper to my tenderloin before I smother it in the mustard.  Thank you Koalagirl.  You his this one out of the park!

Great flavor to the mustard sauce. The only improvement I could offer is to tenderize the pork before cooking.

We didn't do anything to change this recipe.  It ended up being a great meal.  The Dijon marsala sauce gives a tart bite to the flavor of the pork but we ate it all and enjoyed this dish

Had a large tenderloin so I split it between this and another recipe. What made this so delicious was the sauce- bar none. I served the pork medallions over noodles and served it with steamed green beans. The sauce went well over it all. This one's a keeper!

This was really great. I followed some other reviewers advice and added mushrooms to the sauce at the end which was really great, but it would have been good without as well.

Very tasty and super moist.  I did not use the full amount of mustard on either the pork nor sauce but it was very delicious. Also subbed chicken stock for Marsala Wine and 2% milk for heavy cream, simply because I did not have those items on hand.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I've been using this recipe for about 5 years now and haven't altered it one bit (well, sometimes I will use a red onion if I have no shallots).  My family, to include two young boys, loves it and my husband and I fight over who gets the last of the sauce.  I use this meal when we have out of town guests because its so easy, can easily be doubled, and always pleases.

Wow! I made this recipe last night along with some homemade spatzli. It was so good, and so easy to do even with a house full of people distracting me. My picky teenage kids loved it too.  I didn't have shallots, so I used leeks, and that was amazing. I also added a little chicken stock to the sauce as I degreased the browning pan so that I would have a little more sauce. Just great. I was surprised to find that I didn't need to add any salt or pepper at all… maybe there was enough seasoning in the mustard and the chicken stock?
Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good! I followed Julia Child's similar technique and baked the pork in the same casserole I browned it in at 325 for 25 minutes, then poured out the grease and then made the sauce. I made the mistake of not adding the onions (shallots) before adding the wine and it was a GOOD mistake, because they added a nice crunch to the sauce.  Excellent with mashed potatoes. This one's a keeper!

Thank you, thank you for an outstanding recipe. I made this for two foodies and they were delighted. After reading the suggestions I made the following changes to the sauce: added garlic and mushrooms and seasoned the tenderloin with lemon pepper while browning. Next time I will double the sauce since I served this with homemade noodles.

I've made this many times - exactly as the recipe indicates. It is guest quality so I save it for when I am entertaining and serve it with roasted potatoes and a medley of stir fried, colourful vegetables.

Very easy and sauce is amazing.  I did add 2 cloves of minced garlic and served over rice.  I browned the pork in a cast iron skillet and then put it directly in the oven.

This is the recipe that for the first time my kids asked to have the sauce on their plate!  We all loved this so much.  I added mushrooms and garlic, but that's all I did to the original recipe.  Great dinner!  I served it with rice and an artichoke.

I am not the  greatest cook but made this sauce with pork tenderloin and it was amazing. If you make this and add mushrooms like many others do then friends will think you CAN cook. It's wonderful!

Really tasty. I used Port in place of Marsala, also added fresh mushrooms. Sliced them and browned them with the shallots.
Careful adding the cream, I poured it in too fast lane it started to curdle but I gave it a strong whisking and saved the sauce.

This sauce was to die for! It is lick-the-plate good! I didn't have pork tenderloin..just some boneless pork chops, which worked just as well.  I also seasoned them and the sauce with some salt and pepper.  This is fantastic!!

We had this for dinner last night. WOW!! We all felt it was restaurant quality flavors!  Excellent recipe! Only changes we made were very minor. We had to add a little cornstarch to the sauce, to get it to thicken, and we put some pepper on the meat after we put the dijon mustard on it. Other than that, it was done exactly as directed. It is not a hard recipe to do, which is another plus! We will most definitely be making this recipe again! Kudos to KOALAGIRL for sharing it with all of us!

This was a great meal.  I was a little confused at first as to how much mustard went on the pork and how much went to the sauce, but I quickly realized the 1tbsp was for the sauce.  My husband went back for thirds because he loved the sauce so much.

Made this for my husband and mother-in-law.  Both loved it!  I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream and it still turned out awesome so I imagine the original recipe is even better! Since the recipe didn't specify dry or sweet marsala wine, I used half a cup of each. It was a perfect sweetness.  I personally wouldn't want to use the full cup of sweet marsala. I agree with others, this isn't a sauce for chicken.  It is perfect for the pork!

DH and DS loved this sauce, but I thought it was a little too sweet.  I made the recipe as stated, but when I tasted the sauce, I decided to add a little lemon pepper and some garlic to try to balance the sweetness.  I think I would like it better made with a dry white wine.

I used 1 lb. of boneless pork chops.  The mustard on the chops was a little overpowering for me, but I typically use scant amounts of condiments because I find them generally overpowering.  The sauce was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make again and try it on chicken as well.

tried this last night, The pork came out so moist and juicy and the dijion was so good on it. I had to use the sweet Marsala wine on it because it was the only one I could find and I have to say it was very rich. I also used onions instead of shallots and it was fabulous. Will make this again.

This is "Slap yo Mama" good. I did not change anything. I used shallots as instructed (not green onions as some reviewers did). I used a good dry Marsala (Floria). The men raved about it. I made a loaf of beerbread and the sauce was literally gone in minutes. I served with bacon wrapped whole green beans seasoned with lemon/pepper, a nice complement to the pork. Its a keeper. Thank you Thank you!!

This dish is excellent! I followed the recipe, but have to agree with the other reviewers, not to coat the tenderloin with mustard before browning.  Instead add the mustard to the wine when making the sauce. Coating the tenderloins before browning, just burned the mustard in the baking dish, so to avoid that, I will skip the coating. Otherwise, this was a fantastic recipe, and I WILL make it again and again! Served it with some rice pilaf and vegetables (sauted fresh onions, zuchinni and yellow squash).

Excellent! I browned the tenderloin with salt and pepper before slathering the dijon mustard on and then roasting it. I also added fresh mushrooms and minced garlic with the shallot and am glad I did.  It definitely needs the mushrooms. It was so good. My husband loved it! A keeper!

This was divine!  I will double the sauce next time to use with our rice.  And I will also add mushrooms, though it was perfectly delicious without!  The sauce would also be great to create chicken marsala.

Loved this recipe.  I used porkchops instead of pork tenderloin, and it worked great.  I didn't have shallots, so I used an onion.  Also, to be healthier, I replaced the cream with half and half.  They were delicious!

This is a yummy & low maintenance recipe. I made it last night served with rice and brussel sprouts (trim the stems, cut in half, coat with olive oil and Johnny's Season Salt and roast at 350 deg until most are a deep golden brown (~20 min)). A few minor changes will lower the fat/calories.

Tenderloin was wonderful. I never used Marsala wine before, and wasn't sure whether to use dry or sweet.  I chose dry and didn't care for the taste so I added chicken broth to cut the dryness.  Hubby thought it was pretty good, especially with the added mushrooms.  Will try again!

I made this dish for Christmas.  The pork was good but the Marsala sauce was too strong for our tastes.  Next time I will use half a cup of Marsala & half a cup of chicken broth with the other ingredients.

This dish was a winner!  I sauteed portobello mushrooms along with the shallots as suggested by many reviewers.  Served with an orange zest and ginger jasmine rice.  Everyone raved and licked their plates clean.  We all decided this sauce would work well with chicken, veal or filet mignon.

I made this tonight. OMG This was a wonderful dish. My husband raved how delicious it was. Thank you for this yummy dish Koalagirl. I didn't change anything except I also used my cast iron skillet for the one dish meal and I used light cream because I didn't have any heavy cream. It still turned out fabulous. I will definitly be making this again!! Thanks again for your submission.

Really great! We added some thyme and instead of shallots used fresh garlic. We reduced the marsala by half then added the cream and mustard. Kids even ate it!

Definitely a winner!  I have been making this recipe for a few years now (almost the exact same recipe too).  The pork is also really nice bbq'd.  Still coat with the dijon and then grill, brush again when you turn the meat! Yummy!

I made this for dinner last night and followed the recipe almost exactly.  Except that I did not have enough Dijon for both the pork and the sauce, so I coated the pork with some Hot and Sweet mustard that was in a Christmas gift basket I had received.  I also had just cut back some Rosemary in my garden and so I also rubbed chopped fresh rosemary on the pork.

For the sauce the only thing I did differently was to put an extra teaspoon of Dijon and used Marsala cooking wine.  The sauce is one of the best sauces I have ever tasted, much less made.  I could eat it with a spoon--in fact, I just might.

This is DELICIOUS and easy.  My husband made some awesome sounds while he was eating this dish....He LOVED IT!  I have to admit, I loved it too.  The loin was so tender, you could cut it with a fork.  I will defintely be making this over and over, and for guests too.

This was such a simple recipe but it came out VERY tasty.  The meat was very moist.  The sauce was wonderful, although very very rich, a little went a long way.  I added mushrooms that I presauted in a spoonful of each soy sauce and butter.  Without draining, added to the sauce and combined it was delicious.  Family said this was a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. We liked our plates clean! Sweet marsala works just fine, as long as you reduce it enough and add a pinch of salt to season. The shallots help offset enough that it's still delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes, which actually ended up fighting with the sauce. It really just needs something very simple, like buttered noodles or rice.

Great recipe. I used sherry instead of Marsala wine and didn't have shallots so used a mixture of garlic and onion. Would definitely make again -- really nice and not too much work.

This was delicious.  Possibly the best pork tenderloin recipe I've ever used.  I only made one tenderloin but kept the amount of sauce the same and it still could have used more.  For one pound of pork I would double the sauce and for 2 tenderloins I would quadruple.  I served it with rice and the sauce was delicious over it.  The only thing I did differently was to use half & half instead of cream because I happened to have some on hand.  Thanks for the excellent recipe...I will definitely make this again

This is an excellent recipe koalagirl!  We just loved it.  I had a sweet marsala wine so it made it more of a sweeter sauce.  I made this with pork chops and doubled the sauce to serve over some mashed tators.  I did add in some sour cream at the end and some italian seasoning just to tone down the sweetness a bit from my wine I had.  I cant wait to try it again and again.  Next time Ill get a different marsala for a different flavor.  While I was eating this...I was thinking the whole time, some crumbled bacon would be good in this!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and did not marinate the pork in mustard before baking them, which I think turned out well. I will decrease the cooking time the next time I make this, as the pork was a little overdone for my tastes. The sauce was delicious! I served this dish with mashed potatoes, rolls and broccoli -  amazing. Great valentines day dinner! thanks koalagirl!

This was so good and so easy.  I wasn't sure about putting the mustard on the tenderloin before browning, so I did it on one and the other one I just seasoned with a little salt and pepper.  You really couldn't tell the difference between the two because the sauce was so good.  Didn't have marsala, so used dry sherry and didn't have shallots so used regular onion.  Next time will use shallots and add mushrooms like others have said.  Will stick with the sherry because we loved it!  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is simple enough to make on a weeknight, but delicious enough and impressive enough to make for company. I added mushrooms, as some reviewers suggested, and used slightly less mustard to rub down the tenderloins. I also replaced the heavy cream with half and half. The dish was very flavorful and the sauce still very rich. The cook time was spot on; the meat came out perfectly cooked and very tender. I will definitely be making this again, and will probably make a version of this dish using chicken for family members who don't care for pork.

Excellent dish.  I made a few revisions based on what I had on hand.  I used an organic sauvignon blanc, and finely chopped onions and garlic in place of shallots.  I also used only a few TB of half & half in place of the cream to keep it a little lighter.  I also added a TB or so of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.    I roasted the pork tenderloin with some whole garlic cloves inserted into the roast with a rub of olive oil and sage, salt and pepper. I wrapped it in foil to conserve the pork juices.   It came out delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

As per other reviews, added 2 cloves of minced garlic and mushrooms to the shallots.  My husband said it was the best meal he's ever eaten!  Served with wild rice and steamed asparagus.  Might try french cut green beans next time.  I will also double the sauce.  Can't wait to make again!

Wonderful!  My husband said this had to be the best dish we have ever served to company!  I added a couple garlic cloves and some sliced portabella mushrooms along with the shallots.  And after we seared the tenderloin, my husband grilled it.  It was awesome!  Served with Dad's Pan Fried Green Beans (from this site) and make ahead mashed potatoes.  The sauce was delicious on the pork and the potatoes both.  A must try!

Very delicious. I would have preferred a little less Dijon and cream, but my husband loved it just as is. 40 minutes was the perfect amount of cooking time.  The meat was cooked thoroughly but was still very moist and delicious.  I browned some Yukon Gold potatoes at the side time I browned the pork, and roasted them in the same pan with the pork for a delicious side dish.

Very good but the sauce is the main reason.  Used the sauce on the steamed broccoli and also drizzled over the honey roasted potatoes.

I made this for company and it got rave reviews.  I made it with the same white wine I was serving with the meal.  I added some sliced mushrooms and used 10% cream.  I topped it off with some fresh cracked pepper and a touch of sea salt.  Even though I doubled the amount of tenderloins I didn't double the sauce as I was serving it with scalloped potatoes and fresh green beans and baby carrots in a garlic butter.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this one again

OMG! The house smells wonderful while making the sauce. I have made it several times as written and it is just perfect. Browning in the Dijon Mustard first somehow seals in the juices or something as the pork tenderloin, even without the sauce, was the best I ever had.  Add the sauce and it is heaven! Other times I have used half and half instead of heavy cream as it was what I had on hand and it turned out just as well.  The last time I made it I threw in a box of sliced baby Portobello mushrooms and that was a nice addition too. This recipe is VERY easy and will really impress everyone with the flavor and tenderness of the pork, not to mention the enticing aroma while the sauce simmers and reduces. I am not ordinarily a Marsala fan but love it in this dish. Just the right flavor to compliment the pork well. Fabulous recipe! Thanks!

Nice and tender and great taste.  Did not have Marsala so used white wine instead and added sautéed mushrooms.  Will do again, maybe with chicken breasts for a change.

This was very good, we also added some mushrooms. We made all the sauce but used only 1 tenderloin and we were happy to have the extra sauce ! We served ours over angel hair pasta with a few fresh chives cut up on top!

WOW... Go alittle heavy on the Dijon, A little over a baked potayo w/  broccloli & sour cream... Wow... If your looking for flavor on a day off your diet this ones jumping with flavor... 2 Thombs Up. Take it up a Knotch with a hit of hit pepper flakes or Red Hot Sause just before serving.

My whole family loved this recipe! It's a wonderful combination of flavors and nothing is over powering.  I just came to my recipe box to make it again tonight :)  I used thick pork chops and sauteed them until browned and cooked through.  I then removed to a plate and made the sauce.  I added fresh mushrooms as many others suggested as well. I served over brown rice with peas and it was fantastic!   A company worthy dish!!

One of the few recipes with sauce that actually reflects an accurate amount.  Do not double the recipe because this yields quite a bit of delicious sauce!  Our tenderloin was just a bit dry, so next time I think I'll use a marinade or add some marsala sauce to the pan.  Cooking time was perfect - tenderloin baked quite well.  Sauce was rich and tasted professional.

YUM!! The tenderloin was so tender and tasty. The flavor was just right. The only thing different is that I used light cream. Tastes just as good if not better than some restaurants pork tenderloin dishes. And the best thing about it is that it's very easy to prepare.

oh my gosh - there should be a higher rating for this.  first, i did add mushrooms to the sauce and made the sauce in the pan after roasting the pork in the oven, while the pork was resting.  i also made this on christmas eve for my family and they went nuts.  My husband doesn't like pork and has asked for it to be put on the "regular menu" and my daughter had seconds instead of dessert.  I am sitting on cloud nine!  I also served it with steamed broccoli and put sauce on top of it as well.  Fab simply Fab!!

I made this for my husband. I took it out too soon and the sauce was a bit bitter and and runny.  Later I had it again and it was amazing.  My husband loved the sauce.  It is so creamy and flavourful.  It is definately on my list of repeat recipies.

This is a great recipe. We had twice as much pork for the same amount of sauce called for, and there was still plenty. It went really well with roasted garlic potatoes and green beans with chopped almonds.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. The mustard was just great on the pork keeping the moisture in. My husband loves to grill everything so he grilled the tenderloin and just made sure it hit the right internal temp. The cream sauce is what made it though. It was rich yet not too overwhelming. I served it with caramelized shallots over green beans and long grain and wild rice and it was a great meal. We had a simple salad with olive oil and vinegar with crumbled blue cheese. It was restaurant worthy and incredibly easy. So easy it can be a work night throw together.

Really, really good!  I didn't have any Marsala so I did substitue vermouth.  Not sure of the difference between the two but will try with Marsala next time.  This was a wonderful recipe.  Thanks

I used Land 'O Lakes fat free half and half and waited to coat meat after it was browned and just before putting it into the oven.  I took it out @ 140ºF and let it sit covered for about 5 minutes before cutting and topping with sauce.

Myself and the family really loved this recipe. The sauce is exceptional and I have used the same sauce with boneless chicken breast. Thanks so much this will be a keeper. I have already passed it on to several people.

My husband and I both aren't big fans of pork, but we had a tenderloin on hand so I tried this recipe. Sooooo good! we nearly ate the whole thing between the two of us. I cooked it 'till 160 degrees which took about 30 minutes. (Flip halfway). My sauce  wasn't that thick at first so I added a bit of cornstarch and it was perfect. I used a pinot grigio because it was on hand and cooked my green beans in it as well. (With chicken broth powder and garlic). Definitely a way so jazz up a pork dinner!!!!

This was really a very good dish that I will certainly make again. I followed the recipe exactly and that is the reason for the 4 star rating. I felt the dish could use a little something extra. Next time I will add some Garlic and  light seasoning to the pork as a rub.

This turned out fantastic.  I didn't change a think except to sprinkle some parsley over the top for a more appealing look.  I'm looking forward to trying this with chicken.

This pork tenderloin is phenominal!! The sauce is absolutely delicious and its easy.  The only changes I made were:
1.  Added 1 clove of garlic
2.  Added 1 tablespoon ~ of browning sauce to give nicer color to the sauce. 

EVeryone wanted the recipe and there wasn't anything left!!!!!!! A definite keeper.

Super easy and really great.  Could probably be adapted to use chicken pretty easily.  I also added a bunch of freshly sliced mushrooms and substituted green onion for the scallions.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Simply one of the best thing I have ever tasted.  Followed the cooking directions to a tee.  I did add mushrooms to it as I would with any marsala sauce.  They seem to just soak up the best flavors of the dish.

I made this dish the other night for dinner and while it seems very fancy, the dish is not at all difficult to pull off and would be nice served at a dinner party.  We used a dry marsala and found the flavour to be a bit overwhelming, so if I were to make this dish again, I would reduce the amount of wine in the sauce.  The only change I made was that I only had two tiny shallots left, so I used those and sub'd in regular chopped onion in place.

I made this meal for my husband and myself last week and both of us absolutely loved it!  We loved the sauce so much we made it again to serve with our bar-b-q striploins.
Fantastic!  A definite keeper and my husband keeps asking when I'm going to make it again!

This was really, really nummy!  I'm not a mustard fan, by any means, but my husband is.  This has such a slight mustard taste, even I loved it!  We made it with homemade potato chips and the sauce was great over that too!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Ok, I really liked this recipe.  I prepared it exactly as directed.  I thought the taste was wonderful, different without being overwhelming.  However, my dh and 2 daughters (15 & 11) didn't seem too impressed.  They thought it was "ok, but not the best."

Well - in typical form I had to get creative w/ some of the ingredience - just white wine instead of Marsala and German mustard instead of Dijon.  It was seriously fantastic - My husband and I barely left any for the kids *L*  I am making it this weekend for a dinner party - Thank you Koala Girl!

Wow, didn't think much of this recipe when I read it, because it hasn't got any additional spices in it including salt or pepper. Came out perfectly! Such great flavor and SO easy. No marinating ahead or anything! Made one change with sauce...I pureed the sauce right in the pan with one of those one stemmed mixers. It made the sauce sweet and smooth. GREAT RECIPE FOR BEGINNERS.

I ALSO CUT THE MARSALA TO 1/2 CUP AND IT WAS PERFECT.  MY HUSBAND LOVED IT AND HE USUALLY DOES NOT LIKE ANY SAUCES WITH HIS MEATS.  WILL SAVE THIS RECIPE.  THE SAUCE WOULD BE GREAT ON OTHER MEATS LIKE BEEF TENDERLOIN

Awesome!  My husband called it "phenomenal" - high praise!  Good combination of the sweet marsala wine and the shallots.  It did take a long time to reduce the mixture, but it was well worth it.  Will definitely make again.
Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe was great. However I think the marsala wine took over the sauce. Maybe it was the kind I used. I will make this again but maybe with a milder marsala wine. I also used fat-free half and half to sub for the heavy cream. Obviously the sauce wasnt as thick and rich as it could be but its a good way to cut fat and calories.

This tenderloin turned out so well!  And it was super easy!  I used a whole seed dijon, and I think that next time I will use a regular dijon, just because the mustard seeds made it hard to get a good sear on the tenderloins in the first step.  Other than that, though, this recipe turned out really yummy!  The sauce was delicious.  I served with glazed baby carrots and garlic mashed potatoes.

This recipe was fantastic. My husband and my 2 daughters "fought" over the last few pieces of tenderloin and the sauce. I have been a member since 2002 and this is one of the few recipes I have reviewed.

Fantastic! Everyone raved - my 10 year old suggested that we serve this for Christmas dinner to our whole family.  I sauteed garlic with the shallots.  It was sooo easy - definitely a keeper.  My personal touch? I used a southwestern style dijon - yummy.

This is my first review for anything on this site, which I have been using for a couple of years. This was absolutely fantastic! The sauce was perfect. I used the shallots, garlic, and baby bella mushrooms. The loin took some babying because mine was only about 1 lb. and I had to adjust cooking time. I had some leftovers of both the meat and the sauce and it was just as good re-heated. My boyfriend loved it as well. Definitely one of my new favorites, thanks!

We made this recipe for a Christmas Eve get together, and we couldn't have been happier with the outcome.  While the pork was delicious, the cream sauce stole the show.  This sauce would be great on chichen as well.
Make this for anyone, you will not be dissapointed with their comments.

This was delicious, and so very simple. It made a great presentation at the table. Only thing I did change was saute garlic along with the shallots, and I doubled the sauce. I poured it over penne pasta along with the sliced tenderloin. If you like Marsala, you can't go wrong.

A great recipe. I too added some diced mushrooms to the Marsala sauce. I made extra sauce as I served the pork over brown rice. I could have used more. 
I grilled the pork after applying a dry rub without mustard and placing in the fridge for a few hours.

Very tasty! The pork was tender and the mustard Marsala sauce was outstanding. I baked the pork covered for the first 20 minutes, and then uncovered for the last 20 minutes. Highly recommend this dish.

2.27.19   WOW, was this ever good!  Had some mushrooms in the fridge, so I sliced and sautéed them while the pork was cooking, and then before serving, added them to the sauce.  The sauce takes a little time to make, so allow enough time  for the alcohol to cook off for that mellow marsala wine flavor and the sauce to thicken.  Hands down, that sauce is what takes this recipe over the top in my opinion. Served with scalloped potatoes and steamed carrots with butter and cardamon.  A splurge for sure with all of that heavy cream, but thoroughly worth it.

delicious pork recipe. pairs well with some oven roasted vegetables and the rest of the red wine. Subbing red wine (Cabernet) for marsala wine worked great for the sauce. Done forget SALT! Would definitely salt and pepper the tenderloin before applying the Denon mustard. Also add salt to the sauce after you add the wine and cream.

I just made the sauce since I used the Sous vide and pan seared the tenderloin. But the sauce was great! I had to use half & half since it’s what I had on hand so that may be a good alternative

I didn’t make any changes except made more sauce which wasn’t necessary. It was wonderful. The meat was very tender and flavorful.  The sauce was fantastic. I will make this again. Our guests loved it.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  My guests begged for the recipe.  Mmm....
Oh - I had a handful of sliced mushrooms and added to the onions and butter to saute.  Excellent addition.

Made 1/2 recipe with one, 1-1/4 pound tenderloin. Followed others' advice about putting pot I browned the meat into the oven, rather than using a separate pan. Once meat was cooked (±30 min, internal temp 145ºF), I put the meat in foil back in the switched-off oven while I made the sauce on the stove top. Serves 3, maybe 4, 4-5 oz portions of meat.

Easy and delicious....followed the recipe.  Only change was we added the dripping from the pan after baking to create a little depth to the sauce.  Stumbled across this recipe, and so glad I did!

I didn't change a thing and it was awesome.  Pretty simple sauce, what's not to like.  My wife, a notorious picky eater, cleaned her plate.  Served with rice and string beans

I made this with a 1.5 lb. tenderloin. Browned in a skillet then coated lightly with the Dijon mustard   Placed in a baking pan at 350 for 30 minutes. Made the sauce in the skillet while twith mushrooms, onions and fresh garlic. Really tasty with rice and green beans

Great recipe, thanks Koala Girl. Doubled the sauce by using 2 cups cream, 1 c Marsala and 1 c chicken broth, added mushrooms while sauteing shallots and garlic, removed while reducing, added back in.

Seemed a bit bland..sauce was excellent but too thin.  May do again but add a bit of cornstarch to sauce.  Cooking time too long.

I browned the meat in a cast iron skillet seasoned with S&P. I transferred the meat to my pressure cooker and basted the tops with course ground deli mustard and set the timer for 20 minutes. While the cooker did its thing I made the sauce in the cast iron. We all found the sauce pretty strong on the Marsala, so the next time I make it, I'm going to cut the wine in half. I also added fresh chopped garlic, S&P. Very delicious and think a new family favorite! Thank you for sharing.

This was delicious! It wasn't hard or complicated either. Just be sure you cook the sauce long enough to lose the alcohol taste then the flavors blend beautifully. I also added mushrooms and some sharp cheddar cheese ( the cheese want in at the very end, just long enough to  melt. M husband
ate quite a bit of it.  Susan.

This is ‘company worthy’. I read a lot of the reviews and decided to prepare it pretty much as described. I did add mushrooms...cooked them with the garlic after removing the pork from the pan. Once the mushrooms were tender, I used a slotted spoon and set them aside. Then proceeded as directed, adding the mushrooms back to the sauce once it has thickened. Super yummy!

Ridiculous! So good, and so easy, the only changes I made to the recipe, was to add some regular mushrooms that I had left over to the shallots, and I seasoned the pork with a little seasoning salt and pepper. My family loved it, even the pickiest 11 year old in the world.

There aren't enough stars for this recipe. I partially sauteed some baby portabellas and then let them simmer in the sauce as it cooked down which went really nice with it. Served with a side of sauteed spinach. absolutely delicious.

As others have said, I was leery about the Dijon mustard but the flavor of the mustard isn't overpowering while adding a tasty tanginess to the sauce.

Excellent! Wonderful flavour! I only used one tenderloin.  I didn't have any Marsala so I used Fortified Wine. I Used green onions instead of shallots. I seared the tenderloin in a pan, then smeared the mustard on the pork and put in the oven using a baking dish. I sauteed mushrooms and the green onion in the same pan as the pork was seared in. I omitted the mustard in the sauce, as I thought the mustard that I put on the pork was sufficient. I didn't start making the sauce until the pork was halfway cooked. 
I will definitely make this again!

Loved, loved loved this dish. Read several reviews and taking a little something from several I ended up with this. Seasoned 2 loins with kosher salt and coarse black pepper, pasted on the Dijon. Browned loin in a cast iron skillet which went right into the oven for the roasting. The browning left a nice crust on the bottom of the pan. Removed loin from skillet, sautéed the shallots, garlic and mushrooms with butter. Removed that, made sauce, put SGM back in. Used dry Marsala by the way... Had an issue with reduction (no patience on my part) so I added a flour/water mixture to thicken sauce up. Bingo, bango, bongo...nailed it. The person who opt'd not to paste the Dijon missed out. Must not be a Dijon fan. Served over egg noodles with roast veggies on the side. I will put this one in the rotation.

The recipe itself didn't say which kind of Marsala so we bought both bottles. Now I have a sweet to try the next go round. Which will be sooner than later because the fam just loved it...well me too...LOL.

Wasn't trying to impress anyone cause I do know my way around the kitchen but I was pleasantly surprised to hear a word (yep, mostly nothing) out of my father in law. He had 2 helpings and said twice how good the meal was. Those were the only words he needed to say. Well that and the fact that I could come over and cook whenever I wanted...LOL.

We used wholegrain French mustard because we just love the mustard seeds.  One tip, use a instant read thermometer so this does not get overcooked, 135 degrees internal will be a nice medium rare.  This is one great recipe!!!!!

This was absolutely outstanding! I followed others suggestions and add some garlic and mushrooms to the sauce, but that's not what made it so great! The base recipe is so excellent it just added a little extra depth. This will definitely be made again and again.

I've made this dish several times and I'm never disappointed.  Every single time i make this dish for company everybody loves it.

It's so good that I've never had to add or subtract from the original recipe,  it's perfect as written

I have made this recipe now about 10 times, my husband loves it and so do the kids! The only change I made was using an onion instead of the shallots. I also added some minced garlic too.  I have made a couple other pork Marsala recipes and this one is the best! The pork usually turns out very moist and tender using the Dijon mustard! Yum!

Was delicious!  I also, coated the loin after brazing, and cut the cream in half, those are the only changes I made. The wife loved it, and I will DEFINITELY be making this again!  Surprisingly easy to make for anyone.

The flavor in this is like something out of a high-priced restaurant, and has some flexibility for alterations as well. Here's what I did:
1. I had pork loin chops & was able to make 8 of those with this recipe. I browned them in the frying pan quickly and then only 10 minutes on either side (20 total) in the oven. 
2. I didn't have Marsala but I had Sherry, so I used that. Delish!
3. I substituted the heavy cream for half & half (for a bit healthier meal).
4. After the reduction was just about done thickening, my chops came out of the oven. I poured the juices from the oven pan into the reduction and added a container of sliced mushrooms. 
5. Served this with orzo pasta!
Thank you!

I LOVE this recipe!! The only modification I would make to this recipe is to add mushrooms and double the ingredients for the marsala sauce as I like to completely coat each bite in the marsala and so you can have extra sauce for any leftover tenderloin. In addition to adding this to other meat dishes, it would also taste great on pasta. Thanks for the recipe. It will definitely go in my collection to enjoy for years to come!

I made this recipe exactly as written (although the recipe didn't specify sweet or dry,  I used dry Marsala) and found the end result to be very bland.

I seared the pork tenderloin before rubbing it down with mustard, and 20 minutes ended up being just about perfect. The real star here is the sauce - the sauce was fantastic. Had to use a yellow onion because the supermarket didn't have shallots, but it still worked well anyhow.

Holy cow, or pig I suppose in this case! This got rave reviews from the family. I felt like we were dining at a 5 star restaurant. Here's how I did it:
I heated up peanut oil almost to smoking in my large skillet. While the oil was heating, I slathered my loins in mustard. I know it said 4 tbsp, but I just gunked it on. I also used French's yellow, since I had no dijon. It was great anyway! After the oil was hotter than heck, smack! I slammed the loins down in there and browned them up good. I turned them to "brown" all sides. I was afraid I'd cook it too long, so I didn't get them totally browned. I then put them in a baking dish and dumped the oil and juices from the pan over them. After that I made my reduction sauce in the pan I cooked the loins in. I replaced the wine with chicken stock + 1 tbsp vinegar. I don't cook with wine. I also added two tsp of minced garlic, and I also dumped 4 tsp minced garlic on the loins while they were baking. It took about 20 - 30 minutes for the sauce to reduce and get thick. I used half and half instead of cream as well, and before I added the stock I microwaved it for 2 minutes to heat it up. 
Took out the loins, sliced one up, and dumped half the sauce on it. Served with mini red potatoes and mixed vegetables. OMG you will love this!

I made this recipe and it was easy and quick to make. It was absolutely delicious, moist, and tender. I served it with long grain brown rice and whole kernal corn. My granddaughter and great-grandson who dislike pork due to its usual dryness, ate it up! It definitely is a "make again" on my quick and easy recipe list.

This was really good! I prepared this as written except to add a bit of garlic in the marsala and also I mixed the 4 tablespoons of Dijon with a bit of garlic powder and pepper before rubbing it on the pork tenderloin. The light crust that the mustard made on the pork was delicious. I didn't use cream because I didn't have any and I wanted to keep it lighter, so I used 2% milk. Because of this, I had to use a bit of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce up. I served it over egg noodles and with blistered Green Beans with Almonds. I will be making this again for sure!!

After reading reviews, I wasn't going to coat the tenderloin with mustard after browning but did anyway. I was also going to add mushrooms but didn't have any.  I cut the sauce recipe in half as I had a 1.20 lb. tenderloin. I'm a sour cream lover so I added a dollop to the sauce. Next time I'll try the 'shrooms' for variety. Thanks for a great recipe! Hubby loved it and so did I! (I did add the Dijon to the sauce as well and used a  dry Marsala) Simply put...Delicious!

Delicious!  I read other cooks tips and waited to slather mustard on the tenderloins until I pulled them from the oven.  The sauce is so delicious it's hard to describe.  I didn't have mushrooms but plan to add them next time.  I will make this again.

Really an awesome dish!    I used red onion in place of scallions and 2% milk because I didn't have cream.    I did add a bit of corn starch at the end to thicken it.   Like others, I added sliced mushrooms to saute with the onions and it was fabulous!    I would make this sauce over and over again - and the pork was perfect too!    So easy and perfect even for company!    Great recipe.

while i'm confident this recipe would be good as is, i made a few slight additions: in addition to the dijon mustard, i added cracked peppercorns, kosher salt and dried rosemary to the coating. to the pan sauce i added sliced mushrooms and minced garlic to the sautee before adding the wine, mustard and cream. just delightful.

Family loves this recipe.  Did modify slightly.  Used 1 large shallot, used 1/4 c water,  3/4 c marsala cooking wine and 1  1/4 c  heavy cream.  Hubby was never a huge fan of pork tenderloin but he loves this

We were looking for something new and different to do with pork tenderloin.  This was just the ticket!  Really moist meat.  The sauce was so simple and delicious.  I had no Marsala in the house, so I used Sherry instead.  Worked beautifully.  We REALLY enjoyed it.

I don't know what I did wrong but the sauce was very thin. I followed the recipe exactly, didn't add or substitute anything. This was just okay for me. 

(Although - I did cook the pork on 400 for about 30 minutes because I was roasting potatoes in the same oven).

Made this for my sister who claimed that she found pork tenderloin to be so bland. She asked for the recipe!
Found that only one side needs browning. Then turn meat over and place  in oven for 20 min. Other side  browns as meat cooks.

I really enjoyed this when I was a carnivore. Now as a vegan, I find the sauce is just as delicious when served over portabella mushroom caps or eggplant. I just use almond milk instead of cream and smart balance organic instead of butter. I'm gonna try it over rice and veggie mix tonight. Awesome sauce on just about anything. But please visit mercyforanimals.org and skip the pork.

This was good, but a little too rich for my personal liking.  It's my first time trying a Dijon/Marsala sauce, so don't have anything to compare it to.  I followed the recipe except for cutting it in half.  Served with mashed potatoes and Roasted Garlic Cauliflower from Allrecipes, which was a nice compliment to the pork.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, KOALAGIRL!

Awesome recipe. I did it a little different. I didn't coat the loin with mustard until after I browned it. I used salt and pepper on the loin and browned it in olive oil. Then I coated it in Dijon with finely chopped shallots and parsley mixed in. I also added a little garlic and mushrooms to the sauce.

I have made three times so far.  I stick to the recipe but I add sautéed mushrooms.  My family absolutely loves it.  It comes out better every time.  My only recommendation is if you have a cast iron pan, definitely use it.

Awesome! Made with 2 small tenderloins about a pound each. I did use a cast iron skillet and browned the meat seasoned with a little s&p 1st. once browned rubbed with dijon and returned to pan to make a crust and to have those great pan bits. removed the meat and lightly wiped out pan to remove the loose bits to keep the sauce creamy and not loose any of the good stuff. De-glazed pan with a bit of marsella and the butter, added chopped onions (what I had) put meat back in pan a put in oven to finish off. Mine was about 25mins. Removed meat to plate and let rest while making the sauce adding a little minced garlic with the butter (the italian in me) remove pan from heat for a minute to loose some heat then adding the wine then slowly stir in the cream and mustard bring back to heat and simmer till reduced. while sauce is cooking slice the meat and arrange on platter to make it pretty, when sauce is done pour down center of slices and garnish with some fresh snipped parsley or cilantro. This dish is amazingly good. Was skeptical about mustard but the combination of flavors is wonderful and subtle. This one goes in the keeper rotation. I strongly suggest using the smaller tenderloins as opposed to one big one as they don't require as long a cooking time reducing the chance of scorching and burning. This was great, thanks Koalagirl. Happy cooking all. GG

For those that like a little more sauce, I tweaked it a little.  I used a pint of heavy cream and a half cup of dry Marsala.  I also sautéed shallots and mushrooms before adding the liquids.....turned out delicious

I made this as written but halved the recipe with one tenderloin. I browned it all over in an oven proof skillet, after coating it with the mustard. This took about 5 minutes. Then I put the skillet in a 400 degree oven to finish cooking, about 12 minutes. I cannnot imagine leaving this particular cut of pork in for 40 minutes total. Mine was juicy and slightly pink. The sauce was excellent, however, very sweet and rich. For sides, I had roasted asparagus and a saute of fresh corn, chopped onion and jalapeno pepper cooked in butter for about 4 - 5 minutes. It was a sensational meal. The jalapeno in the corn helped offset the richness of the marsala cream sauce. Thanks for this keeper!

The sauce is a bit off for me, maybe too much mustard and wine, too tangy.

I put Dijon over the pork and marinated in a bag for a couple of hours.  We loved this.  My friends wanted to lick their plates because it was so good to the last drop.  Since I doubled the recipe it did take longer for the sauce to reduce but it was worth the wait.

The sauce is really simple but has great flavors.  I didn't have Marsala so I used a Pino Grigio with a tablespoon of honey. I also tossed a few chopped mushrooms in the pan with the shallots. The recipe didn't call for salt or pepper but I added both to the sauce.

One of the best meals I ever made! I made this with pork tenderloins for Christmas dinner and it was, without doubt, the best port I’ve ever had.  I’d been expecting to have left-overs — I made a lot more than we’d normally be able to eat — but no-one could stop eating, it was that good!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this with a pork loin filet....prepared it exactly as the recipe instructed. Of course cooking time was a bit longer, I baked it 30 minutes per pound, and it came out so tender you could cut it with a fork. (I did turn it every 20 minutes while baking.) The marsala sauce was divine, though next time I may just cut it in half because there was quite a bit left over, even with generous helpings.  I will definitely be making this again, it was just out of this world good! Thank you for such a great recipe!

Excellent. I did not need to cook mine past the original 20 min.  Use a thermometer.  I also had run out of dijon so I used a stone ground and added a splash of vermouth. I only had one shallot so I used some garlic.  It was excellent and easy.  Thanks

This recipe is delicious!  I've made it a few times with shallots and once with onions; it is much better with shallots.  The sauce is so flavorful and keeps the meat moist.  Would recommend this to everyone looking for a pork tenderloin recipe.

Made this tonight and the whole family loved it!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added baby bella mushrooms and garlic to the sauce.  I cooked my two pork tenderloins (3lb) for 25 minutes on each side at 350.  Came out absolutely delicious.  Next time I will double the sauce.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

OMG!  This was amazing!!  Very simple yet restaurant quality.  Not a big Pork lover but this was just over the top.  I too added garlic and mushrooms to the sauce which gave it a lovely flavor.   This was very easy to make and the results were just wonderful.  Husband could not stop complimenting me.....then topped the evening off with the Southern Peach Cobbler from this site.  Thank you for so many wonderful recipes.

I was really worried making this. The marsala seemed so overpowering and the sauce was "littered" with browned bits and onions. I decided to strain the sauce and am happy to note the marsala flavor softened considerably and was most enjoyable over nice moist slices of tenderloin and rice! Thanks!

Wow!! This is fine dining but at home! My husbands first words were WOW and I agree. Not only did I like this recipe for the simple fact of not too many ingredients but very easy to make. I had all the ingredients except Marsala wine, so I googled subs for it and if you mix 1/4 cup dry white wine with 1 teaspoon Brandy you have a sub. I did this 4 times to equal the wine. This is a favorite! Love Love Love this recipe!

Awesome!! I am not a mustard person but paired with the Marsala, it was perfect!! Two things I did differently was, I did not coat tenderloins with mustard and I added a little butter to oil when browning. This helped to cut the splattering of oil. I will double the sauce next time, couldn't get enough of it!!

Awesome but too much sauce for 2 tenderloins. Half should suffice. Also used skim and two tbs of flour and was pretty good, try heavy creme next time to see flavor diff.

This is a fantastic dish.  Make sure to brown/sear the tenderloin very well.  Resist the temptaion to add salt to the sauce or the meat, it really doesn't need it and it's easy to make it too salty.
I really like this dish, it is wonderful and rich.

I was eager to try this given all the great reviews and I was not disappointed. I knew it would be good as it was fairly simular to my Chicken Marsala sauce. The sauce is quiet good and fits the pork perfectly.
I would rate it four and a half stars if possible because I did add garlic and mushrooms. The second time I made it, I served it over steak and added fress thyme as well. 
I also seared my tenderloin first and then rubbed on the mustard before placing in the oven. 
It's going into my recipe box and will become one of my "company's coming" meals.

Followed this recipe just as it is written.  This was absolutely delicious.  Very nice meal with short prep & cook times, which makes it a perfect weekday dinner.  Also great for dinner guests, presentation is very nice.

This was good!  I didn't have dijon mustard and used ground mustard instead.  It did taste a bit mustardy.  Pork turned out perfectly - I used a meat thermometer and took it out when it reached 165.  Overall, not too bad.  Hubby said I could make it again, which doesn't always happen when I try new recipes!

Made as written except for the addition of cremini mushrooms.  Sauteed them in the skillet after transferring the pork to the oven, removed them from the skillet, added shallots and continued recipe from there, adding 'shrooms back in the sauce before reducing.  Served with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus...yum-yum!

ok, this has been in my recipe box since 2008 and I finally got around to making it.  Yummy!  Easy to make and delicious.  I followed other reviewers ideas and added garlic and mushrooms and did not  put the mustard all over the meat before browning. I may try that next time to see if it does make a difference.  I did have to add salt and pepper to the sauce.  Also, I didn't see this on any reviews but my sauce was pretty thin, I am a thick sauce girl and took some sauce out, blended in some cornstarch and thickened it up.  My family loves any sauce and next time I will make 1 and a 1/2 times the sauce.  Thanks for a resataurant quality meal.

Made this with chicken (preference), added mushrooms, used onions of shallots(what I had), and half n half instead of heavy cream(attempting to make it healthier)...but I loved how the recipe turned out! Despite these changes, I still think the original recipe would be 5 star :) Oh, and to make things a little easier, I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, and cooked, then made the sauce...it was faster that way too...

This is an awesome recipe and has now become a frequently used one in our household.   I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I did have to keep my pork in the oven a bit longer than the recipe stated, so you might want to check it before removing from the oven.  Absolutely delicious!

I thought this was really delicious and easy to make (a big plus in my book!) The sauce was thinner than I anticipated it  being but was really good. I did add some mushrooms to the sauce which I thought was a good tip.

What a fantastic recipe!  It is simple and delicious - equally appropriate for a weeknight family meal or a dinner party!  I serve this with a simple Parmesan risotto and steamed green vegetable of choice.  My husband who generally does not care for pork at all has made/requested this twice in the past month!!  Thanks for a keeper, Koalagirl!

My father actually recommended this recipe to me.  I am the busy mother of three children under the age of 10.  I finally made this recipe after replenishing my Marsala stock and I can't believe how fantastic it came out (husband and kids loved it too). The pork was tender and juicy, and the sauce was restaurant quality for SURE!  It was perfectly flavored exactly as the recipe reads...that said, I did a few small substitutions:  I didn't have a shallot, so I used a small white onion diced and sauteed with about a teaspoon of garlic.  I also coated the pork with the mustard AFTER I seared it on all sides in the pan, so the mustard didn't char. I made it again and pan-seared, coated it with mustard and cooked it in the crockpot on low for 6-8 hours.  It was amazing like this as well.  Great Sunday dinner and this will be a recipe I serve whenever I have guests to my home!!!!!

I made this using boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of pork, and it was absolutely terrific!!  I didn't have green onions on hand, and I added some salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  Will definitely make this again.  Next time I will add fresh mushrooms.

I had to make the redneck version, substituting beer for the wine and green onions for the shallots and it was still just wonderful - definitely a keeper.

My family enjoyed this recipe, but alas, I did tweak it.  I didn't have Marsala so I used dry sherry.  And onion instead of shallot.  I would prefer shallot because it would be subtler than the onion.  Yummy!

Made this a one skillet meal. Browned and roasted pork in cast iron skillet. While pork was resting, sauteed slice mushrooms, shallot and minced onion. Followed rest of the recipe substituting fat free half n half for one half of the heavy cream. Served with steamed green beans and israeli couscous to soak up the yummy sauce.

This recipe is so easy to follow and it's good too. I thought I overcooked the meat but it ended up really tender. I guess I did not preheat the oven properly. My husband loves the meat and the sauce. I added salt and pepper to the meat before browning it. I also used regular onion and added garlic. If I'm gonna make this again maybe I will just mix Marsala with broth.

This was excellent!  The sauce was amazing!  My husband and I are bigtime foodies and we couldnt get enough!  I used a smaller ternderloin and only cooked for 20 mins total.  The pork was super tender and the sauce was perfect.  My sauce didnt seem to thicken so I stirred in a tad of flour.  Delicious!  Will make over and over again!  Great recipe for a dinner party!

I halved the recipe.  In an effort to reduce fat and calories, instead of a half cup heavy cream, I used 1/4 cup 1% milk and 1/4 cup light cream and used no oil or butter in the sauce...just cooking spray.  I think it took a little longer to thicken but it got there.  VERY good.  I thought it tasted strong in the pan but it complimented the pork very nicely.  I put a tiny bit of oil and salt and pepper on an 18oz tenderloin and grilled on the FOREMAN for 13 minutes.  It was super tender,  served w/ veggies and garlic mashed.

Completely missed the "coat the tenderloins with mustard" part! Funny, missed the 4tbsp on the ingred. list too...don't know where my head was.  That said, I thought the 1tbsp in the sauce was plenty enough for the dish and after having made it tonight, I am SO GLAD I missed the extra 4 tbsp.  I think it would have been too much, but that's just my personal taste.  It was a savory recipe and we served it with jasmine rice.  Very good.

Wonderful.  I ended up using pork chops instead, and and doubled the mustard for the sauce.

This was very good. It was my first time using either shallots or marsala wine. I followed the directions as written and hubby said the sauce was very 'complex' tasting. This is 'company' quality.  I used the leftovers today to make a play-on of a cuban sandwich. Used the sauce as I would mayo on the inside of the sandwich along with the leftover pork, smoked ham, pickles and harvati. It was outstanding.  I will definitely make both again.

Absolutely delicious!!!  The only think I did diff was to salt and pepper the meat prior to coating in the mustard sauce and by finishing off sauce with 1 Tbs. butter to make it do the final pull together and add sheen to the sauce.  I have given this recipe to at least 8 others and they all love it.  Even a big hit with the young kids of all ages.

Excellent!  One of the best sauces I have ever made.  I did not have any shallots on hand so I minced a large clove of garlic instead.  Will definitely make this again.

This was awesome!  Cooked it about 3 or 4 times already in the last few months.  This tastes like something I would eat at a fancy restaurant.  I only made one change however.  I only put 1/3 cup of the Marsala wine instead of 1 cup.  I thought it was too strong and overpowered the cream.  Overall this is a yummy dish.  I highly recommend this especially for entertaining.  It will impress your guests..

What a FANTASTIC recipe!  Made this for my husband on our anniversary, and he said it was BETTER than restaurant quality!  We LOVED it and will definitely make it again.  Served with sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes - the perfect combination!

This was good. Not great, but good.  I read a few reviews about it being blan.  I noticed that Salt and Pepper are never mentioned in the recipe.  I salt and peppered the shallots and mushrooms as well as the pork tenderloins after putting the mustard on. Added a little more to the sauce.  The sauce was delish.

Not as good as I hoped.  We did use half & half instead to save a few calories, but maybe that was why.    But my boyfriend said it was plenty good.

Delicious! Made a few adjustments- used a pork roast and browned in a dutch oven.  After browning added some white cooking wine to just cover the bottom of the pan and transferred the dutch oven into a 325 oven for ~2.5hrs; for the sauce, subbed onion for the shallot.  Served the pork with mashed fauxtatoes and sauteed green beans and it was amazing!  Definately making this one again!!

Maybe i did something wrong after reading some of the other reviews, but i found this to be bland and didn't think that the cream and marsala flavors blended together well at all.

This is one of the best pork tenderloin recipes I've tried from this site. Followed the recipe for the most part, with the addition of sliced mushrooms and minced garlic to the sauce while cooking the shallots. I used grainy Dijon mustard, and a little more than the recipe called for. The taste and texture of it in the sauce was quite nice. The Marsala was a tad too strong, I will reduce it to 3/4 cup next time. Served this with some steamed broccoli and white rice; was a hit with my dinner guests. "Refreshing Limoncello Cake", also from this site, is an excellent dessert to serve after this hearty Italian-ish meal.

My mistake might have been using a wine that was too sweet but even past that, I truthfully did not care for this recipe nor did my family.  I definately will not make this again.

All the people I served this to loved it but I think that the sauce overwhelms the meat.  It's just too rich I think, and it gets cold fast and begins to chunk.  Maybe I will try milk instead of cream next time.  Mushrooms in this sauce is a M U S T.  Thanks to all those that suggested this.  Made a mushroom risotto on the side and served with roasted asparagus.  Amazing for dinner parties - this one wows them all.  Incredibly easy to boot.

Excellent recipe.  I had never made a white sauce, or a reduction before so I was curious how it would turn out but it was delicious.  Started the reduction about 30 minutes before, just keep an eye on it because once it starts thickening it goes fast.  Thanks a lot!!

I am not usually a sauce or gravy lover but this sauce is DIVINE! I swear I could drink it by the cup! I serve this with red potatoes to add some color. I've made this several times and it has become a family favorite. I pretty much follow the recipes as it, maybe adding garlic but basically its perfect!

I've made this several times and it's fabulous. I've added mushroom to the sauce and I think it's a good addition. I've also made with filet mignon and it was as terrific. I've stopped coating the pork with mustard and it's just as good.

I changed up the recipe just a little & it was very good.  I used minced red onion & garlic as I could not find shallots (as recommended at shallots.com)and I added parsley flakes for aesthetic reasons.  I felt there would not be enough sauce, so I added some chicken broth.  Over all it was very nice & we really enjoyed the meal.  I will make it again :)

I liked the sauce on this, but no one else in my family did. I probably won't make it again, but if I did I would not put all the mustard on the pork like the recipe calls for.

This is an excellent recipe, and very simple to make.  I only make two changes when I prepare this dish, I add mushrooms, and I DO NOT coat the tenderloins in mustard before browning.  I have prepared this dish for many friends and relations, and everyone has loved it.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I loved this! However, my son didn't and my husband said that it was just okay. I will probably make this again anyway. Next time I will double the sauce because I served it with brown rice and green beans and we poured the sauce over everything. Yum! I did use onions instead of shallots because that's what I had on hand. Baking time was right on.

This was a test for me. I haven't been cooking very long. I was surprised how easy was. It turned out fantastic. My in-laws came over, don't eat or drink anything with alcohol taste. They loved it. Even had 2nd helpings. My husband wants me to make it again. I did add mushroom, a dash of thyme & some minced garlic, as someone suggested. Did it when added the shallots. The sauce tasted great. This will go on the menu for family & friends.

Very good flavors.  Ours came out very salty tasting and there's no salt in the recipe??  My guess is that the dijon mustard had a lot of salt in it and the butter was salted butter.  When you reduce the sauce this flavor really comes out.  I would suggest unsalted butter.  We would definitely make again.

Absolute favorite meal EVER! My husband made this for me when we were dating, and now we make it for every special occasion we have. My only complaints are that the sauce is a little thin, and you end up spending just about as much as you would to dine out to buy all the ingredients. But it's so worth it, just not every single grocery trip. :) The prep is a little overwhelming for me as my husband is the main chef around here, but it's not so bad if you have help.

This was fantastic. I made it for fathers day dinner last night and am still getting rave reviews on this meal.  I served this with roasted new potatoes, steamed broccoli and some fresh bread (you'll want the bread so you can eat up all the great sauce this recipe makes).  The sauce also tastes great on vegetables!

Tasted decent, just not one of my favorites. Way too much sauce. Make sure to use a high quality marsala.

Very easy and quick recipe, except that I thought the sauce should have been thicker and while I did cook long enough to reduce the liquid by half, it still never thicken up like the picture shows.  The flavor was good though so we enjoyed it, especially my husband since he isn't all that crazy about creamy sauces so he was happy about it not being thicker.  I did cook mushrooms to add to it, but the only other thing I did different from the recipe was not using the same pan I browned the pork in, as I didn't want the fat from the pork in my Marsala sauce.  Should that have made a difference?  I would give this a 5 if I could have gotten the sauce to thicken.

This sauce is delicious and worthy of 5 stars. I used shallots the first time, but I didn't have any the second time, and I used white onions instead, and it was still delicious. I highly recommend trying this recipe.

I just needed this recipe for the sauce. It was very, very good and smelled delicious while cooking. I did use the shallots and not onion (as written), but also threw in some mushrooms. We did like it much better with mushrooms. Really good sauce.

This recipe is awesome.  I have made it twice now. The second time I did not have shallots in the house but added garlic powder to both the meat and the sauce. I am making it again tonight.

Very good.  Sauted chopped garlic and mushrooms with the shallot.  Followed other reviews and browned seasoned loin before coating with mustard.  Sauce was perfect.

FABULOUS!!! Only way I can describe it.  It was soooo tender and juicy and I loved the sauce!  I made this according to the recipe with the exception of using white wine because I thought I had Marsala and I couldn't find it.  Will definitely try again with the Marsala.....

This recipe is so good!  I did not have any shallots at home, so I finely chopped some red onion instead.  I used cooking Marsala wine and it was such a wonderful flavor with the Dijon and onion!  My boyfriend absolutely loved it, and I think I'll make it for my mother when we have her over for dinner!

Didn't WOW me.  The Pork was cooked perfectly and was very moist and tender.  The Dijon Marsala Sauce lacked something, although my husband and I were at a loss as to what could make it better.  Perhaps those of you that are a bit more creative could give a few tips.  My kids loved the pork but not the sauce.  It wasn't the marsala flavor because they have had Chicken Marsala many times and enjoy it.  Like I said, it was OK but I was hoping for more from the sauce.

Overall very good. The recipe would have resulted in overcooked (dry) pork, I would suggest using a meat thermometer for perfect doneness. Next time I would add a bit of garlic, and marinate the pork in the dijon for a few hours.

I thought it was good, but my husband didn't care for it much - it seemed really dry even though I cooked it as stated and my chops were almost an inch thick. Oh well, I'll just try a differnt recipe. Thanks anyway!

Wow, this was AMAZING!  I followed the recipe as written but I did add a few cloves of garlic and I doubled the recipe to feed 12.  The pork was amazingly tender and the sauce, OH MY the sauce!  It was a huge hit at m family dinner and I got huge compliments.  So easy, so fast and so yummy.  Thanks Shar for a great go to recipe that I'll keep forever!

I tried this recipe for Christmas dinner and there wasn't a piece of meat left. I used fat free half and half and small red pearl onions since I did not have shallots. I also rubbed the the tenderloin with the dijon mustard and cooked it in a rotisseiri. Fantastic. Would definitely make again.

WOW!! I amazed myself. This is a GREAT recipe. My DD's (5 & 7) helped make the sauce and they have devoured the entire meal. My husband is not getting any dinner tonight. 

I followed the suggestions by many other reviewers. Cast iron, substituted onions, added mushrooms and doubled the sauce. I used lean pork chops because it is what I had. Served over white rice with peas. 

I can't wait to serve this to in-laws and friends. Definitely better then many local restaurants . Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I made this the other night because I happened to have just about all the ingredients except heavy cream so I substituted sour cream instead and it was just great.  I will definitely make this again but may cut down on the dijon just a little since I prefer the taste of the marsala.  Thanks for a great one!

This was delightful.  Easy to make and very tasty.  My family has added it to the "keeper" box.  I browned the pork in a cast iron skillet and put it directly in the oven, then made the sauce in it after the pork was cooked.

VERY easy and good. I used fat free half and half...my sauce curdled immediately and I had to use a bit of cornstarch and water to thicken. Use dry marsala and mushrooms...any kind. I used a can of straw mushrooms I had. I will double the sauce next time. I could just eat the sauce poured over jasmine rice and be happy!

This recipe is a keeper.  I would have given it five stars but I thought 2 shallots were a little much.  Next time I will only use one.  However, aside from that it was easy and very tasty.  Lirestaurantke another reviewer wrote, it was restaurant worthy.  Thanx.

This was great, I used regular mustard instead of dijon(it was all I had)and it turned out so good. We have 2 pickie eaters and they could not get enough of it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I made this last night after looking for something new to do with pork tenderloin.  Thank you for this recipe.  It was so delicious.   I followed your recipe pretty much as stated, I didn't have butter so I used a little extra EVOO and I did add the fresh sliced mushroom as so many others suggested.  My husband and I enjoyed this and I will be making this many times in the future, I'm sure.  The sauce is wonderful and the tenderloin was so very moist.  Again, thank you.

Exellent Recipe.  My husband complimented it four times, which is probably the most I have ever heard him compliment anything.  The only difference I made in the recipe was that I used boneless pork chops instead of the tenderloin.

I did the recipe EXACTLY as written.  I don't think it needs mushroom, it is delicious and perfect as is.  I would try mushroom and see the difference in the future.

This was awesome!  We served it for Christmas dinner following the recipe exactly except for substituting low-fat half and half for the heavy cream.  We used dry marsala wine and browned the pork in a non-stick pan (Anolon) to prevent any burning.  We took the pork out of the oven two minutes shy of the recipe and let it rest for about fifteen minutes covered w/ aluminum foil, and it was juicy, tender and delicious w/ no traces of pink.  Fabulous and elegant, thanks for the post!

Excellent and easy meal! I also would wait to make the sauce until right before serving, as the sauce thickened much more quickly than I expected and then started to dry out by the time the meat was done. Definitely something I could enjoy making again for a quick meal that breaks from the ordinary.

WOW!  Both my husband and I gave this 5 out of 5 (we would have ranked it higher, if possible).  It was so tasty that my husband went back for seconds and cleaned his plate both times!!  The sauce was so yummy (and easy to make).  Next time, I am going to try the sauce with chicken!!!  A definite keeper!  I served this with the zucchini casserole II found on this site...perfect for a quick and tasty weeknight meal!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe from your site. I have tried many but this one really was worth taking the time to review. I received rave reviews from all. I did add some mushrooms to the sauce but that's the only adjustment I made. Oh, and I didn't cook the pork quite as long as suggested, but instead used a meat thermometer and took it out at 150 degrees. I let it set covered will I finished the sauce. It was wonderful and very tender and the sauce was to die for!

This was great!  I made it as written, but used thick cut boneless porkchops as I didn't have a tenterloin and they were awesome.  Am going to try the sauce with boneless chicken breasts next time.

This turned out really well.  We substituted half and half for the cream, and used onions instead of shallots.  .  At first the sauce seemed a little too strong of a Marsala taste, so I added a tiny bit more butter and half and half.  Our pork definitely took longer to took, since we had over 2 lbs of meat.  Will definitely make again.

This is one of the family favorites...even my babies love this one. The picture really doesn't really do it justice though. It's quick and easy too.

This is a Must Try, 10 Star Recipe!!  I am not "a cook" but this was easy, looked like it came from a fancy restaurant and tasted absolutely wonderful.  Omitted the shallots, browned some garlic in the oil and drippings, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  EVERYONE, including my husband and picky 8 year old enjoyed this one.  A definite keeper.

Made this recipe for dinner last night.  I was very good, although a little salty.  I did add fresh sliced mushrooms and used half and half rather than heavy cream.  The sauce did not thicken very much, I think because of the half-and-half.  Just used a little cornstarch to finish the thickening.  Would definately make again.

The sauce had great flavor but I thought it was way to heavy for my tastes. I might substitute a lighter cream next time. The pork turned out wonderfully though.

This was excellent!!  It was easy to make and the marsala sauce flavored the pork beautifully. I especially liked this recipe because the pork did not needed to be marinated ahead of time, so it makes this a great recipe to do at the last minute and still be somewhat gourmet. My son who eats nothing...loved it.

Gosh I was really excited about this recipe and it just didnt work out for me.  I think I may have a different opinion if the pork was not overdone.  Maybe the recipe should call for thick cut pork.  The sauce was really good.  The pork was too "mustardy", but as I said, maybe that would have been ok if the pork was not overcooked.

I fixed this last night and it was superb!  The only change I made was that I only used one shallot instead of two (my husband doesn't like onions or shallots).  One reviewer talked about cooking the meat faster and hotter so it would not dry out, but I followed the directions exactly and the meat was wonderfully tender and juicy!  This is definitely a keeper--thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good, and different than anything I've done with pork before.  I messed up and accidentally bought a roast instead of a tenderloin (I just cut it into smaller pieces so it would cook in the same amount of time).  The sauce was good, too, my husband raved about it...I thought it was missing just a little something but can't put my finger on it.  Still, pretty easy to put together, and very tasty!  Might try this as a crockpot dish next time...

Very good dish. I did salt and pepper the tenderloin prior to coating with mustard. Next time I will thicken the sauce with either a little flour or cornstarch and will only make about half of what the recipe calls for.

We give this one 3 1/2 stars. The cooking time was perfect for the two tenderloins in the pkg, I cooked it covered with foil, and the pork was perfect.  If I make this again I'll cut down on the amount of Marsala, it was just a little strong, otherwise very good.

I made this last night for dinner, and my boyfriends and I liked it a lot.  Instead of serving it over chicken instead of pork though.  Thank you for a good recipe Koalagirl.

My husband kissed me in the middle of dinner he was so delighted with this.  He said it was the best thing I ever made!  The only thing I did differently was that I used bone-in chops and browned them with the dijon.  This recipe will be back in my house by popular demand.

I used this sauce over grilled tuna...yummy!  I'll have to add mushrooms next time.  I would have given 5 stars but I wish the sauce was a bit thicker.  I added some cornstarch w/h20 to thicken mine.

Good recipe!  I'd like to rate it a 4 1/2 so there you have it!  Used garlic and mushrooms as others had stated.  I thought it could use a little more flavor.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks!

This recipe was soooo delicious!!  Much better than any marsala sauce I've had at restaurants.  I did not use shallots, but sauteed mushrooms instead.  Perfect!
