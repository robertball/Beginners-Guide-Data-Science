Fantastic - a nice gut filling soup for this crazy Montana winter.  Add a little red wine and it'll drive the people wild!

I only used one can of beef broth and added a lot of garlic salt and about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. I also omitted the bag of frozen veggies but took the advice of a prior reviewer and added about 1 c. of red wine.  My husband loved it!  Topped with aged parmesean and served with fresh beer bread!

This turned out quite good, a really nice soup/stew.  Liked the flavor with the peppers and spice, I added more.  A quick and easy recipe suggestion that can easliy have different veggies or spices added or substitied to it.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have mushrooms but added a package of Knorr Vegetable soup mix.  So yummy!

As written this was really bland. I added a teaspoon each of dried basil and oregano, which helped add flavor.

I'm usually opposed to ground beef in soup, but since I that's all I had, I found this recipe.  Not bad!  I basically used this as a jump-off point for all the fresh veggies I had sitting around that needed to be used -- a head of cauliflower, bunch of broccoli, carrots, squash, onion.  Since I was out of tomatoes, I used a can of tomato paste.  Also used two beef bouillon and two chicken/tomato bouillon, since that's what I had.  I also wanted to thicken it and stretch it some, so added about a 1/2 cup barley.  

So, basically I barely followed the recipe at all...  but I am of the opinion that it's hard to go wrong making soup.  Throw in what you have, throw in some spices, let it simmer and voila: soup.  This is a great starting point recipe.

This had some heat, and I didn't even add the red pepper flakes!  I nixed the cauliflower, added red wine, and halved the beef broth.  I used the crockpot (browned beef first) and threw everything in on low to cook all day.  DELISH.
