This packs some pretty awesome flavours. I was skeptical about the Greek seasoning in this salad but it works. Just took a couple bites to get used to. I love the healthfulness of it. I might try white balsamic next time.The recipe portions are pretty big so I cut it down to a 1/3. It still made a pretty good sized bowl full. Thanks for sharing Wayne!

We totally enjoyed this salad though next time I'll use white balsamic vinegar for a better looking presentation. I might also include feta cheese as we really do like it. Mmm mmmm good. Would be even better when local fresh grown produce is available.

This could actually be one of my top 3 favourite salads. I wasn't sure about the combo of some of the ingredients but they are a match made in heaven. If you love mango and avocado and balsamic vinegar you'll love this! Since baby cucumbers are in season I opted for those and they added a great crunch with the peppers among the softer ingredients. 6 stars if I could! Thanks for a great recipe Wayne.
