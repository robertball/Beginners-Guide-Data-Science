We searched for punch recipes for my sister-in-law's wedding in July and stumbled across this one.

We scaled the recipe to about 125 servings and put it in a punch fountain. This punch was SO good! Everyone loved it - we had to refill it just as soon as we got back from the wedding, before the bride & groom even got to the reception! It's really, really good and VERY easy to make!

I made this for an office party, and have handed out the recipe to at least 10 people.  It is a surprisingly good punch, and extremely easy to make.  I also had a friend add vodka to her recipe for an alcoholic variety.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit.  I also wet the rim of the glasses I served the punch in dip the the rim in red crystal sugar and place a strawberry on the side of the glass.  Everyone loved it.

Both kids and adults enjoyed this punch.  The fruit punch is the predominant flavor tasted.
