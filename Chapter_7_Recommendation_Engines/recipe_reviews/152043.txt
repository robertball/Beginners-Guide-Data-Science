We made this for my daughters Spanish project. These were really soft and hard to roll in the pine nuts. Some kept their crescent shape during baking and some melted. Maybe that's what the cornstarch is for to soak up any excess liquid so it doesn't melt. The lemon was a little overpowering. Taste and texture-wise it was like eating the inside of a fig newton but with nuts and I do not like fig newtons or it's like the filling of baklava. It caramelized on the bottom so it stuck to the pan and when we removed them individually they fell apart. We had to reshape them for the spanish project pictures. I'd suggest parchment paper to anyone making this. Different cultures have different tastes but I don't think I'll make this again. I gave it 3 stars only because my greek and latino co-workers asked for the recipe.

I must have done something dreadfully wrong. My cookies melted down to nothing and were a flat gooey mess.

I must have done something wrong. After adding the sugar to the potatoes I couldn't get a dough. It was more like soup. But I cooked it anyhow. It tasted good but it remained a gooey mess.
