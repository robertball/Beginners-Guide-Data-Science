These were a nice little appetizer! Kind of like a loaded twiced baked potato bite without the twice bake! I did cut the recipe in half, to use up some fingerling potatoes that we had boiled the night before for dinner. I also used just a few tablespoons of "real bacon" pieces (you know, the kind you can buy already cooked in pieces to use to top a salad). I think the amount of bacon in the recipe would be way too much for the amount of potatoes, personally. I would also add that these are best served to almost room temperature.
