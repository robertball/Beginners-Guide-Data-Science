Pretty good recipe.  A little odd for my tastes, but my jamaican boyfriend loved it.  Definatly a new taste if you are tired of the same old!

I was looking for something different, and this was it! I cut way back on the salt/pepper (1 tsp each - just right for me). Also cubed the chicken so it would cook faster. Left out the olives and otherwise followed exactly, and it was absolutely delicious! It will be added to my regular rotation. Thanks for sharing.

Very very good! I am giving it only four stars because I omitted and changed quite a bit.  I reduced salt to 1/2 tablespoon and reduced pepper to 1 tablespoon.  I omitted the mushrooms and olives because my husband and I don't like them. We had it over white rice and it was EXCELLENT! Will definintely make again.

Not my taste.  I am a new cook so it is possible that I really messed this up.  My family is not used to really spicy food either and this one was HOT.

My fiance loved this and I thought it was pretty good other than the amount of salt and pepper.  I cut down to 1 tbsp salt and 1/2 tbsp pepper.  The pepper amount was just about right but it was still a little too salty, it seemed to overwhelm the orange flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.

this recipe was exceptional-my whole family loved it. I baked it a little longer and didn't add the olives, but I followed the rest exactly. I will make again soon.

This was a hit. Flavorful, delicious and super easy and adjustable. I left out the mushrooms and olives since I didnâ€™t have them, but it was still fantastic. I added a little extra juice and chicken broth (instead of vegetable stock) at the end while simmering the veggies at the end, and I also included lime juice.

This was really pretty average.  Not a bad flavor, but not spectacular and probably not worth the work that goes in making this.  Make the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken instead, it's a lot easier and more flavorful.

Very good. Not as powerful a flavor as I anticipated; which was nice!
