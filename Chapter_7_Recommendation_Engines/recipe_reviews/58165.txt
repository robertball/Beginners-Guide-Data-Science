This recipe is excellent.  Instead of the dehydrated sundried tomatoes, I used the ones sitting in olive oil at the antipasto section.  They were way better.  I still soaked them in the water, and the added oil added a ton of flavour, while keeping the tomatoes very soft.  And the recipe says to use half a box of couscous, which can be confusing.  I buy my couscous from the bulk food store (its WAY cheaper), so I used a ratio of 2 parts liquid to 1 part couscous, i.e. used 3/4 a cup of couscous with the 1 1/2 cups of water

I really enjoyed this flavorful and easy way to prepare couscous. I only had button mushrooms on hand and used leek instead of green onion.

There's not enough liquid when sauteing the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic.  Keep lemon juice to a minimum but add extra water from time to time, just to keep veggies moist; it will evaporate.  Otherwise, a tasty and healthy recipe.

This was good, but it's a bit heavy on the sun-dried tomato. Combined with the lemon juice, it gave the dish a very strong tangy taste. Next time, I'll cut the tomatoes to 1/2 cup and increase the mushrooms. I prepared it just a bit differently: I sauteed the mushrooms first to give them time to sweat, and then I added the rest of the veggies and garlic. Plus, I added the herbs when I mixed the veggies into the couscous, rather than cooking them.

I was worried that all of the strongly flavored ingredients would clash but it was a very tasty dish...even my 90+ year old grandparents liked it, it was flavorful but not too exotic.  I used shitake mushrooms instead of portabello and it was good.

This was pretty tasty and easy. I made a few alterations. I used button mushrooms instead of portobello because I didn't have any on hand, I added extra water to the pan while I was cooking the vegetables, and I threw in a few dashes of crushed red pepper instead of the cilantro.  Very tasty and healthy!

I loved this recipe!  I wasn't sure about the "1 bunch" of green onions, so I just used 4 whole green onions.  Also, I used already-moistened (but not marinated) sun-dried tomatoes, so I cooked my couscous in vegetable stock.  *yum yum*  :-)  (I don't know what the other review meant about not having enough liquid for the vegetables, but nothing extra was needed for me.  Cook over medium heat.)

Unfortunately we thought this was just okay. I won't be making it again. I followed the recipe all the way, minus using the tomato water for the couscous. To substitute I added thick tomato puree and a little bit of chicken broth to get the flavor back in there. The tomatoes were very overpowering - I would recommend putting them in a food processor to get them into smaller pieces.

This was totally delicious!  I did omit the Cilantro because i've never had it & have been told some like it & others don't.  i didn't want to ruin it if I didn't!  i followed everything else except i also zested the half of lemon.  Even my picky kids loved it!

Absolutely Delicious!!! I threw in the Portabellas when I started cooking the Sun-dried Tomatoes and things. I also added fresh mint to the top after it was all done cooking. Very Good Dish!

Easy and delicious!  Instead of portobello I used regular white capped mushrooms.  Served the dish with over roasted asparagus for a healthy vegetarian meal!

It was good, but I think next time I am going to cut back a bit on the tomato and cilantro, but that's just to my tastes.  Otherwise, I think it's a nice recipe that's fairly easy to prepare.

Not only is this a tasteful dish, but also colorful and so simple to make. It's really fool-proof.  I was in a hurry making this, so didn't want to breakout the the measuring cups and spoons, but even with just estimating everything, it came out great. Thanks!

A friend brought this to one of our barbecues a few years ago, I enjoyed it and fully intended to make it myself. But then it got forgotten about, until the other day when I was looking for something different to do with couscous. I only had sundried tomatoes in oil, because of that I used vegetable stock to soak the couscous in. I had fresh basil but not cilantro so I used dried. My daughter pronounced this stunning and couldn't stay away from the serving dish. Thankyou so much Ruth.

Healthy, fresh recipe that even meat-lovers will enjoy. Next time I will ease up on the lemon juice, add a bit more salt, and exchange more mushrooms for sun dried tomatoes.

I substituted parsley for the basil and cilantro because that is what I had on hand and it was really good!  I think it would be better with the basil, so next time I will make sure to have it on hand.  A delicious vegan meal!

Where do I begin? I followed the recipe with the exception of the cilantro (didn't have any) and when it was done I tasted it and wasn't impressed. There was too much tomatoes, the little bit of lemon juice called for made no sauce so it was very dry and it had a real bitter taste. Had to do something to it and quick as the couscous was already done. I added about 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of apple jelly to the tomatoes and mushrooms. Brought that to a boil and mixed in a little cornstarch and cold water (mixed together) so it would thicken. That saved dinner but I threw out the leftovers.

This was wonderful!  I omitted the basil (I thought it would be weird to have both basil AND cilantro), and added 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  I served this with fish, and it was the perfect complement.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a yummy recipe! I've read the reviews before making it and used some suggestions. I used veggie stock for couscous, only 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes. I only had dried basil and parsley, so that's what I used. It was so delicious, my kids cleaned the plate!

This was a great recipe! I loved the depth of flavour from the mushrooms, but the sun-dried tomatoes were a bit off-putting. I'll either soak them longer next time, or cut back on the amount of them.

Very good way to add some flavor to couscous.  My only suggestion would be to use less sun-dried tomatoes.  For us, the flavor was a little over-bearing.

Very good recipe!  Here are some things I did:
-I omitted the cilantro since my husband is not a fan.
-I used the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil as recommended by another reviewer and used the oil to sautee the vegetables.
-I used a can of low-sodium vegetable broth in place of some of the water for the cous-cous.
-I added fresh spinach to the pan at the same time as the mushrooms cooking it until just wilted.

I thought this was pretty good. I left out the basil but I don't think it needed it. I also added added 1 Tablspoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 Tablespoon of honey. I think it helped cut the strong tomato taste a little. Next time I'll probably cut back a little on the tomatoes and add more mushrooms.

This is a very quick, easy and delicious dish. I added chickpeas and used it as an entree served with a cucumber salad.  YUM-O!

Sorry but this recipe didn't make it for us. It wasn't unedible but wasn't good either... I can't even think of something that would make the dish better, I guess it's just not a good combination of flavours. Thanks for posting anyway!

The flavors just did not seem to blend well. I made this expecting rave reviews from my boyfriend, and he barely ate a serving. It wasn't worth the work, and I ended up tossing the leftovers.

I used whole wheat couscous and really enjoyed it.  although I held back on the garlic I think I will put all 3 cloves in next time.  It's a great mix of flavors.  a great healthy dish!  (I served it with marinated white fish)

I've been doing this recipe for several years now and guests are surprised and pleased.  I don't usually have a lot of cilantro around and skimp on it but all of the flavours are excellant.  Been used as both a side and main dish.  I also find it a quick an'easy fix.  Thanks Ruth, well done!

I was looking for a new way to do couscous and the whole family really liked this recipe. The only thing I did differently was changed the mushrooms to button mushrooms.

I just made this and am currently chowing down on it. I only used 2 cloves of garlic, but next time I will use all 3... maybe more. You don't have to be a veggie to love this.

We loved it as a great vegan dinner option...but it only served the 2 of us, even using more couscous than the recipe called for.  Tasted great; we loved it.  Served with roasted zucchini strips.  Perfect dinner.

I really loved this recipe.  I changed it a bit.  I used the sundried tomatoes marinated in olive oil as suggested by others and I also omitted the cilantro.  I used porcini mushrooms and added about 2 tbls of goat cheese at the end.  It was fabulous, this is a keeper!

I used Middle eastern couscous and put dried porchini mushrooms in with the sundried tomatoes. I used 1/4 of an onion instead of green onions. I was also out of lemons so I used the juice from an orange. I was looking for something quick and I thought I didn't have enough to make anything but I was wrong. This is delicious!

Okay, I'm not sure what I did wrong but this didn't turn out so great.  The flavors were just a bit intense.  I left out the cilantro (I am not a fan) and added spinach which helped it out considerably. When it was done it had a nasty after-taste, I think too much basil (?). Then I added some feta, which helped some more but it still didn't impress me. If you make this I would add more mushrooms to ease the intensity of the flavors a bit.

We liked the flavor, but agreed it could use more tomatoes.  I'm not sure my quantities were right - used 1 cup of dry couscous and a dozen grape tomatoes.  Will make again with more tomatoes, but might leave out the cheese.  It didn't add much, in my opinion.

I used the sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil and herbs (more flavor) and skipped the soaking step. I added some feta cheese that I had on hand. Omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any and I didn't miss it. Very nice vegetarian dish and surprisingly filling.

I loved this recipe. Very fresh tasting with all the fresh ingredients but the flavors melded well without being overpowering. And I'm a sucker for any recipe that incorporates both of my favorite ingredients, sundried tomatoes and portobello mushrooms!

Very very good. I save my 5 stars for the truly amazing, but this is a keeper nonetheless. We preferred to scoop the couscous on our plate and add the mushroom/tomato mixture on top. Added more mushrooms as we love them. YUM

I don't like cilantro so I left it out, sauted some leftover corn with the mushrooms, garlic and onions and used some extra basil. The flavors were good, maybe a little strong on the tomato, but everything came together with the addition of a little nutritional yeast or parmesean on top.

I will make this recipe again although I'll change a few things.  I found the cilantro too strong so I'll likely replace that with more basil and I'll also use more sun-dried tomatoes than called for.

This was awful.  I didn't care for the sun-dried tomatoes.
