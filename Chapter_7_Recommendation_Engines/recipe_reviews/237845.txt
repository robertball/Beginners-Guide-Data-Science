Yikes thought this was going to be wonderful but no one liked it at all. I think the vegetable combo would be great but the balsamic vinegar was too strong(?). It left a funny after taste. We threw out the rest. I'll try it again with another marinade.

'Reversed oil & vinegar proportions as another reviewer suggested. Darn it, no feta. 'Still good though. :)

Definitely too much dressing I'd probably cut the ingredients in half for it. The blend of the salad is great and the dressing kind of masks all the veggies. I put red onions instead of scallions. I'll probably make it again but with less dressing. I like balsamic but its certainly a strong taste and smell.

Just want to make correction to this recipe. It is ready once you make it! It just tastes better if it is refrigerated for a few hours so that the flavors combine.

Tasty! Just a warning: the recipe mixed up the quantities of oil and vinegar (it's 3 tbs of oil per 1 of vinegar)
