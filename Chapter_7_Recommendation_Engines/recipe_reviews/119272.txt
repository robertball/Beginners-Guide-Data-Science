The cream cheese mixture is great.  After i made the wraps, i cut them in to 1 inch rolls to make them finger food for my daughter's 2nd birthday.  The kids loved them.  Do not use corn tortillas though.  We tried those first and they fell apart and had a funny after taste.  When i switched to flour tortillas they tasted great!

These were a hit at my party and I would make them again, but next time I will use less onion (and I only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for this time). And I may just use a little onion powder and mix it in with the cheese and herbs, or perhaps I'll use the food processor to get the onion pieces very, very tiny. The children would not eat them for the very strong onion influence. The blend of herbs is delicious, and the dill weed is not at all overpowering. I cut them into slices after rolling them and served them as appetizers - the adults made them all disappeare!

These are great!  I took previous reviewers' suggestions and omitted the onion, though I did add a little bit of onion powder to the mix.  I didn't really measure anything, just threw the ingredients together to taste, and it still turned out great!  I've made these several times since for lunch, it's way better than the boring turkey sandwich.

I added bacon slices to the wraps and made them the night before. I wrapped them and refridgerated overnight and served them at a picnic the next day and they were devoured. Everyone loved these and wants more for the next get together. A hit!

Fantastic! I made this today for a bridal shower and they were a hit! I didn't have basil so I left it out and added more dill. I also omitted the chopped onion all together. Super yummy and I got several requests for the recipe.

This recipe was great!  I did add some shredded cheddar cheese, chopped green onion, and a few dashes of worchestershire sauce to the mixture for more flavor.  This is a nice change to make for my boyfriend to take to work for his lunches.  He really liked them and its something different other than plain old lunchmeat sandwiches!

This is so yummy! Only changes I made were to use less mayo (about a tblspn) and no onion (one review scared me away from them for kids.) My 11 year old says she will eat this everyday for the whole school year. Thanks!!!!

Made these for Christmas.  Great blend of seasonings in the cream cheese.  Did add some slivered carrots for crunch.  Will make again.

3 out of 4 in our family really liked these, my pickiest eater didn't...grrr.  I used regular leaf lettuce (just be sure it's dry).  Next time I think I may ease up on the dill weed (only because I'm not crazy about the flavor).

I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings.  After reading other reviews I used flour tortillas. I omitted the onion and used onion powder instead.  This was very quick and tasty!

Yum! This was really good. I used the calculate button to make just 2 roll ups. I used whipped cream cheese and mayo with olive oil. I used all the seasoning but the dill because I do not care for the flavor. For the onion I used red onion chopped small. For the lettuce I used a couple of piece of leaf lettuce and just left it whole and rolled it. I probably added a little more cream cheese than mayo and added the onion just to taste.  This really made for a rather tasty yet quick sandwich. Would be great to take in a lunch.

The cream cheese mixture is great.  I added shredded cheddar cheese for a little zing.  I am making them again today and adding more meat.  I found that the amount of meat called for in the directions is great for an appetizer-but not enough for a lunch wrap.

This was suggested for kid's lunch boxes.  My little ones didn't like them very much - but I did.  Perhaps when they get a little older...

Delicious!  Well liked.  
Use regular cream cheese.
Use peppered tofurky.  Second choice Hickory Smoked tofurky.  Can also use the mild Oven Roasted tofurky.
Place romaine lettuce leaf lengthwise with middle of rolling, not against rolling, to avoid having to shred.
Arrange small cut pieces on platter with toothpicks in all pieces.

We found this while looking for lunch ideas for our 5yr old. We opted for Laughing Cow cheese instead of the mayo mixture. THey hold up really well, we have even taken these to swim class as a healthy snack.

I left out the onions, as I'm not an onion fan. I made these for a party and they were gone in less than an hour. The spread is sooo delicious!! I'm making them again for a baby shower.Yum!

These are so simply and so tasty. My kids love them. I do add some shredded cheddar to mine. The cream cheese mix is a perfect start for these wraps. Then you can add whatever your heart desires from there.

OMG!!! These are wonderful.  However, I did not use fat free cream cheese or mayo....just don't prefer the taste of either, but I used light cream cheese and Hellman's mayo.  I also left out the dill for taste preferences.  I took these to mom's for the 4th celebration and cut them in small peices to place on a tray and it was gone in less than an hour and there had to be 50 or so pieces all together.  I will definitely make these again!!!

I give this recipe 4 stars for simplicity.  The roll-ups were quick and tasty.  I added a layer of provolone cheese between the lettuce and meat. When making wrap sandwiches, I like to go over the unrolled wrap with a rolling pin before rolling to get a tighter roll and a more aesthetic appearance.

I have made these several times.  Wonderful sandwich substitute, especially in the summer.  I always end up throwing lettuce away when I buy it by the head, so I substitute whatever bagged salad mix I have on hand.  Works great!

This had a weird woody flavor...not sure why. I took others advice and used onion powder. Left out the lettuce and dill due to not having it as this was a last minute lunch on a Saturday. Overall, I will try it again and see if the woody flavor was my ingredients...could be. Thanks for the recipe, Paula!

I love the idea of this. Not your traditional roll up. Unfortunetly i had to change a few things cause of what i have on hand. No dill weed so left that out and i don't like raw onions so i put in onion powder and i don't have sliced turkey so i used frozen leftover turkey(shredded) and also fresh lettuce from the garden! It tasted good but waiting for it to get cold so i can slice it and taste the difference. Other then those changes i kept everything the same!

As written this is quite good.  The cream cheese/mayo spread is very tasty.  A suggestion that ups this to five stars for me is to add some strips of roasted red pepper.  Outstanding!

Kind of bland, so the 2nd time I made them I used veggie flavored cream cheese and spinach tortillas - much more flavorful!

These taste like pinwheels I've had at a lot of parties. Simple and tasty. Great as a light lunch or snack. My five year old, thought they were a little spicy, even without the onions (I'm guessing he tasted teh garlic)... but he did eat half of one anyhow - so I don't think it bothered him too much. I gave four stars because it wasn't very unique - but it was very tasty.

Great recipe for something different.  You can only eat so many ham sandwiches!!!  I'd recommend using a bit less oregano, but that's just a personal preference.   THanks for this great idea!

These were delicious! My extrememly picky 3 year old ate at least half of one, which is no small feat! I left out the onions (none of my kids eat raw onions). The cream cheese mixture makes a great veggie dip.  I found myself looking around the kitchen for more things to eat with it, lol. I'll keep this recipe for years to come!

I actually cooked a turkey breast for the meat.  So it did not roll up, but it was so good.  Next time I may try deli meat, so I get the nice wrap look.

So easy and delicious!  I, too, replaced the onions with onion powder.  I used several different flavored flour tortillas for variety.  All worked well with the spread.  Also, I rolled the tortillas as flat as possible before filling because it gets very thick.  Will definitely be making this again!

Delicious!  I made up my own version after trying this recipe.  I used spinach tortilla wraps.  I also omitted the dill weed and replaced the mayo with sour cream and added bacon bits to the spread.  I then added thinly sliced roma tomatoes.  If you love club sabdwiches or blt's then these are for you!

Amazing!!!! I wanted to keep this parve/non-dairy so i used tofuti cream cheese in place of the dairy cream cheese. I read other reviews that said the chopped onion gave a very strong flavor, so I decided to finely chop a 1/2 of a small red onion and 1 stalk of celery and about 5 baby carrots in the food processor. I removed the vegetables and put the cream cheese and mayo and spices in the food processor. I blended those together and then mixed the creamcheese mixture with the finely chopped vegetables! The vegetables add some color and texture to the spread. I used rectangular whole wheat wraps, rolled them up very tightly and sliced it into 1 inch pieces. (I accidentally forgot to put in the chopped lettuce - I will definitely do that next time though.)I have also used the spread as a vegetable dip - and it is fabulous and flavorful! This was such a hit! *UPDATE* I made this again. I tried pacing spinach leaves along the first side that is wrapped. It was OK, but we all preferred the spinach leaves in a single layer all over the cream cheese layer and rolled up - this way you won't get too much cream cheese in each bite.

I made these for lunch and they did not turn out very well for me. I used packaged deli-style turkey meat and I think that was the biggest problem. Next time I will make sure to use very fresh, thicker, sliced turkey straight from the deli. Also, I didn't use dill because I can't stand it. I will search for a spice replacement. My boyfriend, who eats anything, wasn't too thrilled by this recipe either and only ate it out of obligation. He's such a good sport :)

Made these for a party and left off the lettuce.  The lettuce gets soaky upon sitting.  Can use Spinach instead, because the spinach holds up.

This was really amazing. I usually don't like anything sandwich-ey but these were way too good to pass up. For my Turkey Roll I decided to use three pieces of white bread and stuck 1/3 of an inch of each to another piece of bread with a bit of honey, instead of the tortilla wrap. The seasoning was a perfect blend with everything. I'll try the tortilla wrap next time since the sandwich bread ones came out so well. I think I'll be using this for my lunch as much as possible!

These were a big hit at my daughter's birthday party.  I cut them in 1 inch slices for appetizers.  The tray was empty when the party was over. I did follow other reviewers advise and didn't add as much onion, but followed the rest of the recipe as is.

This was just okay. I did not care for the cream cheese. It was a little to rich.

We love these with fruit for a light dinner- we use lettuce, green pepper, a little bit of american or pepper jack cheese.  Yum!!  I refrigerate for a couple of hours after rolling them, and cut them into bite size pieces when ready to eat.  My son will eat any finger food, evrn if it has lettuce and green peppers.

This was awesome as a dip. My daughter liked it better that way too. Wasn't to thrilled with the roll up.

I made these to use as sandwiches.  They did not go over well--too seasoned.  I think these would probably work better as an appitizer.

These were delicious, easy to make. I took them to a picnic. I had extra cream cheese mixture, we ended up using as a dip for veggies and crackers (try the roasted vegetable Ritz cracker). It was a delicious dip
