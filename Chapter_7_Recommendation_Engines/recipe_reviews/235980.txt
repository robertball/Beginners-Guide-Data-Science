I really like cabbage cooked like this.   I don't think the butter is needed, there is plenty of bacon drippings to do the job.  One note, if you are not adding any water, be careful to not burn the cabbage and onions.  Even just a bit of water to start out helps prevent burning until the cabbage starts releasing it's juices.
