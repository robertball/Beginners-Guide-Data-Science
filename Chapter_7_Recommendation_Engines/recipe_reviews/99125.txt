We love asparagus in this house and this is a good recipe to add to our repertoire. I reduced both oils by half; 1/4 cup [4 tbsps] seemed a lot of oil for a veggie dish, especially with the cashews.  I used the fresh ginger, and found the flavour of the dish to be excellent.

A delicious and pretty healthy way to serve asparagus. Although I followed the ingredients exactly, I made it a little differently: I tossed the thinnest spears in the pack into boiling salted water, removed them as soon as they turned bright green, and then immersed them in iced water for a couple of mins. I then basically just heated them through with the soy/ginger cashews. They turned out perfect! Thanks!

Update! ok, we make this dish about 2-3 times a week, and we ran out of ginger root, and its still good, and we usually dont put cashews in it. It's realllllly good- everyone loves it! We also make it with long green beans instead of asparagus sometimes--mmhmm!

I really liked this dish. i had never made it before and i didn t change anything, except i didnt have a wok so I just used a large pan. My uncle doesnt like asparagus, but he liked this one!!! I thought it was great, and my family is having me make it for them now!! I loved it and I ope this came in handy for you!!!

I served this for Easter (35+ people)and have had rave reviews and requests for this delicious recipe.  I tripled the recipe and found it worked out great... don't overdue the soy sauce as it could get salty.

Awesome. I am not a fan of asparagus, but it always seems as if my husband is buying it and wanting me to serve it for dinner.  I LOVE this recipe.  The only change I made was to cut the asparagus into thirds...a little easiert to eat. I used the stated amount of oil, just used a slotted spoon to take the asparagus out of the pan and left the excess behind. I am going to serve this dish at my next dinner party and when everyone is raving about it, I am going to smile and take all the credit.  Sandy...you are my new best friend...and girl, you can cook!

This was very good, however I did reduce the amount of olive and sesame oil to 1 T each. Also, I used 1-2 tsp reduced sodium Tamari and 1/4 cup cashews. I did not feel like the dish was short on flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Hubby really liked this.  I added just one little clove of garlic and just a bit of freshly grated ginger...he ate it up quickly.  (Me...not a fan of asparagus).  Thanks for the post.

We just had this tonight, and we thought it was absolutely a wonderful asparagus recipe!  Cut the oils in half and used peanuts because we had them.  Make sure you cook the asparagus until tender.  I didn't cook it long enough, but it was still terrific!  Thank you for this recipe!

Wonderful!  I cut the asparagus in pieces and used whole cashews.  I also cut the olive oil and sesame oil in half and it was perfect.  One dinner guest exclaimed that this was the BEST asparagus he had ever had!!

This is my new favorite asparagus recipe! I cut the asparagus stocks short, used minced garlic, pureed ginger, low sodium soy sauce and reduced salt cashews that I toasted. It made a huge difference the second time around. More rich flavor came through in the dish without the salty-ness. The minced garlic is a great addition in my opinion and the pureed ginger seemed to blend/coat everything nicer than the minced ginger. I only used a small amount of sesame oil in the pan when cooking which is less than 1/2 of what the recipe called for and it came out excellent. You can serve this with a lot of main dishes; it seems the Asian flavor stands alone and doesn't need to carry over to the rest of the meal which I was concerned about. Thank you so much!

I thought this was just okay--I've had asparagus other ways that I have enjoyed much more.  My husband really was disappointed in this recipe and thought it was a waste of good ingredients.

This is so easy and so delicious. A great way to introduce a veggie to any dish. It's soy sauce based so goes well with another soy-based main dish but I've brought it as a potluck side dish and everyone loved it with other main dishes. Per usual I tend to double or triple the amount of garlic and ginger called for and it always turns out so tasty.

This was pretty tasty and very easy to cook.  The only thing I'd do different is cut up the asparagus, to bite size pieces.

Unbelievable!  I served with Fabulous Beef Tenderloin and Roasted Red Potatoes from this site and my guests loved it!  I used the low sodium as others suggested and I am sure it would have been too salty otherwise.  I had never used ginger root before and was told that you just scrape the "skin" off with a spoon and then mince.  Thanks for sharing!

This has become one of our favorites!   My husband likes extra spice so we used chili flavored sesame oil.   Also like to add to stir fried chicken.

My husband was not a fan of asparagus nor was he inclined to try it until I made this recipe.  I also cut the asparagus short and cut the oil back by a teaspoon of olive oil.  I used unsalted cashews and toasted them (adds so much flavor!),  added two cloves of garlic (minced) and 2 tablespoons of OJ to the pan with the cashews and and soy.  The orange juice gave a nice, slight citrus "lift" that worked well with soy and ginger flavors.  It is a keeper!

I prepared the recipe "as is" and made a double batch for my dinner party with seven guests. I measured out all of the ingredients ahead of time in prep bowls, and tossed it together when the salmon came off the grill. Got raves! I'll make this again and again!

I have made this recipe MANY times, and my husband and I LOVE it.  The only problem I have encountered is that sometimes the cashews get too brown, and the asparagus are still hard.  Tonight I tuned down the heat to low when I added the cashews, and it came out perfectly.

Oh my gosh, talk about divine! You should re-name this recipe to DIVINE Asparagus and cashews. I didn't change a THING to the recipe..the asparagus was tender, but crisp and the sesame oil, fresh ginger and cashews gave it SUCH a wonderful taste...I have made this three times in the last two weeks..that is how much my family and I LOVE it!!!!

Liked this recipe but did reduce the oils by half. Use unsalted cashews only. I thought that using the salted cashews I had would be ok but it was too salty.

Excellent dish.  I've tried substituting all sorts of mixed nuts and it has worked out well.  If you use salted nuts, just cut the salt out of the ingredients.

OMG I made this last night for dinner and everyone ate all of theirs and kept asking for more especially my picky boyfriend,  even my 2 yr old kept eating more.  Only thing I would change is maybe a little less oils and I used low sodium soy sauce,  it's soooo delicious!!  Thank you for sharing,  making this again when my son gets home from college!

I added one tsp of minced garlic and only 2 tsps of olive oil. I used chopped almonds instead of cashews because that is what I had, also very good with fresh lemon juice squeezed on it right before eating. yummmmmmy... its a repeater..

We LOVED this recipe!  After reading the other reviews, I too cut the asparagus in 3rds and decreased the oil by half.  I used peanut oil instead of sesame oil (just cuz I was out of the sesame oil!)   Quick & easy & yummy!  This one is a keeper!

I'm only giving this 3 stars because as is, there is WAY too much oil. I think next time I make this I might skip the olive oil all together and see what happens. And maybe I'd add a little bit of garlic too, just to add a little extra flavor. Over all, not bad!

This was delicious. My husband and I both loved it. I will definitely be making it again, although with much less oil. For a veggie dish, this was pretty greasy (though very flavorful). I would also leave the cashews whole rather than chopping them up.

mmmm deliscious....the cashews are so yummy and bad for you :)  I would defintely cook the asparagus in the oil mix though - I blanched it and then reheated it in the oil and the asparagus just seemed watery - it didn't soak up enough of the flavor...

Loved it!  Like others I reduced each of the oils by half and it worked just fine.  I also cut the asparagus into smaller pieces for ease of eating and serving.  I intend to try this with pea pods and broccoli.  Use your imagination and you can't go wrong.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was the best asparagus I have ever made!   I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the oil listed in the recipe by half and it was perfect.  I also used sliced almonds because I had them and they were fantastic!  Also, used ground ginger since I had that on hand already.  I highly recommend this recipe because it was not only delicious, it was extremely easy to make.

Being an asparagus lover and a professional chef I'll go easy on this recipe.  On the plus side, it was incredibly easy and quick to prepare. However, being too simple may also be a disadvantage.  The outcome was predictable.  In the future, I would add some lemongrass and perhaps something else.  I definately wouldn't make this again as is.

I added some chopped garlic to this recipe. I also cut chicken breast into thin strips and dipped it in cornstarch, then stirfried it first. Then, stirfried the asparagus and added in the soy sauce and cashews. Served over brown rice and it turned out great! Very healthy natural taste.

I thought this was really good.  But I am a big fan of all the flavors in this.  It was a bit messy when it was frying but I may have been frying it on too high a heat.  It was really quick and easy to throw together.

This recipe was awesome.  I didn't change anything about the recipe, but next time I would use low sodium soy sauce because regular soy sauce mixed with cashews makes for a salty dish.  This recipe goes into my recipe box for sure!

The best way i have found to make asparagus.  My family loved it!  My husband always asks me to make it and my 5 year old eats it up.  i didn't have fresh ginger, but ground ginger worked well.

I love this method of cooking asparagus.  I cut my asparagus into 1" chunks and proceeded as directed.  My asparagus was a bit thick so I had to turn down the temp and cover my pan to cook for awhile in order to get it fork tender without scorching it.  It's good with or without the ginger if you don't have it on hand.  Just use enough oil to lightly coat the asapargus so it won't stick to the pan.  Good stuff!

A nice alternative to serving steamed asparagus, but I prefer less oil. I will  plan on cutting the olive and sesame oils by half next time.

Husband didn't like the flavor, but said it was edible. I didn't like how the asparagus cooked unevenly, but it tasted good. Next time I would cut off more of the thick stalk.

Awesome! I followed the recipe except I used almonds instead of cashews. It was so easy and tasty, it has just enough flavor. I normally don't like asparagus, but this is delicious!

So simple and delicious! I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground. Also added a splash of fresh squeezed orange juice toward the end. I served it with brown rice; it could easily be made a vegetarian main course with the addition of egg or tofu.

Very tasy and easy to prepare.  I like my asparagus on the soft side (instead of crunchy), so I would cook it longer next time.  Cashew and soy sauce combo was great.

Outstanding.  Used white asparagus and ginger spice instead of root, was generous with cashews.  Will make every time asparagus is in season.  A "Best Ever" award from family.

I was skeptical...but after decreasing oil to half of required, (like suggested) using unsalted nuts, and probably a little more than the mentioned soy sauce (light)...I tasted.  YUMMY! So simple and the cashews just browned in the pan to give a toasted flavor. I too, could not stop sampling before serving. I wonder what would happen if you added some lemon zest? or lemon pepper? next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Best Asparagus recipe I've tried.  It really shines when you get a good mix of the asparagus and cashews in the same bite.  Next time I make it, I'll cut the asparagus into 1 1/2 inch sections to make it easier to get those perfect bites.  I'll also follow the advice from Barb's review and use half the oil.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a keeper.  My only caution is to stick to the 1/2 cup of cashews (or less).  My husband and I both love cashews so I added more than what it called for and it was a bit too much.  The star of the show should be the asparagus.

This recipe is excellent, so taste and very simple. After I started making this dish I realized that I couldn't use any soy sauce due to medical reasons, but even with this missing ingredient it was fantastic. Served with Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze recipe from this site.

This was pretty tasty, but it didn't make me swoon or anything.  I will probably make again just because it makes a staple vegetable interesting without resorting to more italian flavours.  My husband liked it but my 2 year old did not.

This recipe was ok.  I followed it exactly.  It had good flavor but was way too heavy on the oil.  I think if I make this again I will use about 1/3 of the oil.

My Mother-in-law made this for Easter dinner!! OMG it is so tasty...we were all batteling for the last tidbit.
We all thought it could use half the oils called for and be just as yummy. Double or triple the recipe, there won't be any leftovers!!

Amazing recipe! I've cooked it for a few different parties and potlucks and everyone always loves it... even people who aren't big fans of asparagus!
The second time around, I used half of each oil, and added a few cloves of minced garlic at the same time as the ginger. I found both of those things improved the recipe even more!

Absolutely fantastic, and very easy to make. I tripled this recipe for a party of six people, and there was none left.

A tip for stemming asparagus: just grasp each stalk near the ends, and bend it until it breaks. Much easier and more accurate than using a knife.

I scaled this down to just one serving, used less oil, and toasted the cashews first in a skillet (just the nuts, no extra oil). The flavour was great!

This was great! Only thing I would add is dont let the asparagus sit too long in the oil before serving. Mine got a little greasy and soggy. But was still really good. Next time I wont use as much oil.

Didn't have fresh ginger root, used ginger from a jar. Very good. We love asparagus and new ways to serve it.

Very good! I had two bunches of asparagus so doubled everything except the olive oil (half the amount seemed to be enough) and the soy sauce (based on others' comments). I had my teenage son make it while I supervised. The asparagus came out perfect: tender but still firm. The cashews made it really good. I added whole cashews instead of chopping them. I will definitely make this again; it's a great way to prepare asparagus.

Delicious!  Love the crunch of the cashews with the crispness of the asparagus.  My only criticism is the amount of oil, next time I'll be using 1 tablespoon each of the olive oil and sesame oil.

There was just too much oil for us.  I am going to try again using 1/2 the amount of oils called for and maybe a pat of butter and near the end of cooking I will add a bit of minced garlic.

Good side kick to Beer Can Chicken.  I will decrease the oils in half next time and possibly the cashews as well.  But it was pretty darn good.  Thanks Shellito!

My family loves asparagus and I'm always trying new ways to prepare it. This recipe is fantastic and very easy to prepare. The first time I made this I didn't have any cashews so substituted peanuts, the 2nd time I used the cashews. My family liked it better with the cashews.

I don't have a wok so I used a regular frying pan.  If the cashews are crushed they stick to the pan.  Otherwise this is quite tasty indeed.  My husband liked it too.

AWESOME! This was an excellent way of cooking asparagus. I liked how the oil and soy sauce didnt steal the flavor of the asparagus, it was still delicios. I also toned down the amount of oil to 1 tbs each, and threw in some minced garlic and green onions, it was fabulous!

This is the best asparagus recipe ever!!  Thank you - even people who don't usually care for asparagus love it - I always have to at least double the recipe when I serve this so there is enough - I do usually cut down on the oils - only a few tablespoons of each and found that to be enough.  Try this you won't be disappointed

VERY tasty, but here are some suggestions if you'd like to cut sodium and fat:  As others have said, halve the oil.  Two tablespoons is MORE than enough.  I used unsalted cashews and about a half-tablespoon of reduced-sodium soy sauce.  Still DELICIOUS!  I can't stop eating it.

This was amazing, and really simple to make.  We loved the taste combinations.  I accidentally chopped the cashews too small and would leave them in much larger chunks next time.  I recommend using unsalted cashews or low-sodium soy sauce or both, as this recipe is quite salty.

This was a great asparagus recipe. It was simple and quick to make. The flavors were delicious. The few things I would change next time is to cut the oil in half, as it was dripping in the oil. I probably would half the cashews too. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a HUGE hit at an extended-family dinner. I didn't make even half as much as I should have. It was gone so fast! I used what I had on hand which was olive oil, sesame seeds (I just sprinkled some in the pan with the oil), dried ginger, and soy sauce. I  tossed in the cashews at the very end and just let them warm through. I can't wait to make this again!

I am not a fan of asparagus but my husband bought them and wanted me to prepare them. I did not have sesame oil or cashews, I used sunflower seeds instead and only olive oil and it was very good. I will definitely do this as an appetizer for my next dinner party.

Delicious!  I loved the subtle taste of ginger in the background.  This is a truly great asparagus recipe.  I wish I could have added the cashews, but unfortunately I didn't have any.  Know that it still tastes great without them.

I was worried this would turn out really bad when I started but was absolutely stunned with how great it turned out.  Wonderful balance and taste; I never would have dreamed this combination of ingredients would taste so very good.  Excellent compliment to nearly any meal, and one I will have in my recipe box forever.  Thanks Shellito for sharing such a great Asparagus dish with us.  I love it!

This was so good!  I love recipes with only a few ingredients.  I used 1/4 tsp. ground ginger instead of fresh.  It worked very well.  The blend of cashews and soy sauce give the asparagus a wonderful flavor.  Thanks!

This was a pretty yummy dish for asparagus.  I toasted the cashews to make them more flavorful.  I like dishes that let the flavor of the asparagus come through, which this one does.

I cut the asparagus a little smaller and served it over Jasmine rice like a stir fry. It was a big hit with the family who are sometimes picky eaters.

This was good. We all liked the cashews with the asparagus, however, next time I will add them a little later in the process. My asparagus was a little thicker than we normally buy and so took longer to cook. The cashews started to brown too much, so we removed them from the pan until the asparagus was done. Next time I will cut the asparagus into pieces first. Otherwise, very tasty.

I cooked this dish as I would a Chinese stir fry dish. I used canola oil, so I could cook the asparagus at a higher temperature. I added a minced clove of garlic to the fresh ginger. I cut the asparagus ( from my garden) into 3 pieces using a bias cut. Stir fried it for 1 minute, then added the ginger and garlic. Continued stir frying for 1- 2 minutes, then added the soy sauce, followed by the chopped cashews.  After the cashews were heated up, then I finished by adding the sesame seed oil and mixed it together for a few seconds. It was good. I think I may add mushrooms and  green onion to the mix next go round.

This is one that we will make again. Normally, we steam asparagus. This dish, which followed recipe instructions to the letter, also tasted great as a cold snack the next day. Perhaps it calls for more chopped cashews than are really needed.

Delicious!  Added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some heat.  Will definitely make this again, and adding minced garlic to add another flavor layer next time!

Very tasty and presentable! Although I switched the cashews for sliced almonds as I do not like cashews in my food. I will definitely make this again

Love this recipe!  Added water chestnuts, matchstick carrots and powdered ginger and serves it along side of a seared Ahi Tuna steak!  Delish!

I accidentally used a little too much olive oil so they seemed very slimy but still packed huge flavor. I had a huge can of cashews on my cabinet and needed to start getting tie of them and this was a perfect solution. This is also another great way to spice up your asparagus!

A very tasty way to serve asparagus.  We don't go quite as heavy on the oils as a lot of folks, so I cut the oil in half, and the dish came out fine to mine and my husband's tastes.  I am always looking for ways to dress up vegetables, so this recipe will definitely go in my recipe box!

It looks like I am in the minority here, but I really didn't care for this. I guess I expected it to resemble the sauce from the "Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews" from this site--one of my favorites--but it didn't even come close.  Going back to preparing my asparagus with garlic and parmesan cheese.

I did not care for this recipe. The 4-to-1 ratio of oil to soy sauce did not work and was too much for one bunch of asparagus. On top of that, there was no way to get a bite of asparagus with some nuts unless you cut into little pieces on your plate and scooped them up together. This recipe had no flavor, was oily, and was visually unappetizing.

This was okay, but there are other asparagus recipes we like better. I won't be doing this one again. It isn't bad, just not one I'll repeat. It is worth a try though, who knows, you might like it better than the other asparagus recipes you've tried.

We hadn't had asparagus before and were a little leery.  My 12 yr old daughter and I loved this it was "better than green beans"  We were a bit heavy handed in the cashews but honestly who can have too many nuts.

I am not a big fan of vegetables but this recipe gave the asparagus a nice flavor and texture. I didn't have cashews so I used peanutes instead, I also cut the oil. Also, apparently asparagus gets bitter the longer you keep it, so I would recommend using freshly purchased asparagus.
