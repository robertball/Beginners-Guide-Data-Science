This recipe is wonderful. It is easy to make. I did bake it an additional 5 minutes to give the topping a more golden brown look. I melted a few extra caramels with a tablespoon of milk and drizzled it on top, and served it with vanilla ice cream. Make sure it is cool when you cut it as it does tend to be a little bit on the runny side like warm apple pie.

Since I'm the first reviewer, I'm anxious to hear if anyone else had the same problem I did.  It didn't set up, so it's kind of runny, not cutable squares.  I may not have baked it long enough because it was hard to tell if it was "set".  The flavor, however, is awesome!  It's a little sweet, but VERY good.

These were soooo good! I went to bed and 3/4 of the pan was left when I woke up there were only 3 pieces left. I used 4 fresh apples peeled and sliced instead of the pie filling. The bars still turned out great, plus it was less sugar. I can't wait to make these again.

I baked this an extra 12 minutes as others suggested (for that I gave it 4 stars), but the taste oh my goodness it was out of this world.     I took this to a bonfire and it was gone shortly after the first piece was cut.

This was a big hit and is really good with vanilla ice cream.  It is a little like apple crisp but the caramel sets it apart.  Excellent for the next morning or two to grab and go to work.

I first made these a year ago. It was the hit of the party - particularly with my teenage nephews and their friends. I used a dipsosable cake pan to make these in. The only change I made to the recipe was the cook time - I cooked the bottom layer 2 minutes less than the recipe called for and I cooked the whole thing 2 minutes longer, so that the topping was slightly browned. This recipe is delicious - the crust balances out the sweetness of the caramels and condensed milk. My kids love it, too!

Oh my goodness, was this great!  Everyone raved, my teenage son ate half the pan. Easy to make, no-fail recipe. I did bake it 5 more minutes, and chilled it well; it cut nicely after that. If you don't have enough pie filling, a half cup of applesauce can be added.
