10.20.18  I scaled the recipe to four servings, ended up with 26 mini meatballs, they cooked perfectly at 16 minutes, and were plenty tender and moist.  They were good, but I didn’t taste quite as much Korean flavor as I would have liked.  In  the future, I’ll  add more seasoning and, perhaps, add some gochucjang sauce.  Served with mango ginger rice, some stir fried bell peppers and onions, and a Thai-style peanut sauce for dipping.  Thanks for sharing  your recipe.
