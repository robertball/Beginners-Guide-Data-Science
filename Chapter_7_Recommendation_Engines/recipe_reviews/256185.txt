This is my first time to have latkes. I liked this recipe and will make it again. Let the mixture to set a bit, to allow the flaxmeal to gel with all the liquid. In the oven, the liquid goes everywhere. I'm at 7,000 ft. and at 20 minutes they were well undercooked, so I cranked the heat to 185Â°C for another 8 minutes. At that point they were browned and crispy outside. Thank you for the recipe.
