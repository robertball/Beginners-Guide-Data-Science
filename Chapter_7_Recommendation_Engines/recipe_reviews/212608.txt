My family had excellent things to say. I did increase the eggs to 6 total. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly as written using my regular white bread. Served with a green tomato salsa,sour cream and a side of country style hashbrowns.

Took a lot of effort to prepare and definitely not worth the result. Mushy and rather greasy, didn't look at all appetizing, but edible.
