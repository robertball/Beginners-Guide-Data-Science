This is close to my recipe except I dice green pepper into the hamburger with the onion.  I also us tomato soup (1 or 1-1/2 cans)  instead of tomato sauce.  No potatoes,no green beans, more macaroni.  And finally, I have added shredded cheddar cheese after making it, and putting in the oven to melt.  Yum!

Great stick to your ribs dish.  I also found that I had to add water (about a cup) to get it to cook.  I added two dashes of tabasco sauce to give it some kick, and it came out delicious.

Wonderful comfort food the whole family enjoys!  I would have rated this 5, but the recipe needs some clarification. I drained the browned hamburger and added everything into the same pan to simmer. I diced the onion instead of slicing (to hide it from the kids) & substituted 1 can of diced tomatos with the juice for one of the cans of tomato sauce. Everything except the green beans simmered together for 20 mins., enough for the potato to be tender, then added the noodles and green bean to cook til tender. Per others' reviews, I added 3/4 cup water with the noodles. Cooking time ended up to be less than 40 mins. Had I cooked it for the 1 hour recommended, everything would have been mushy. Served it with Parmesean cheese and everyone loved it!

This was similar to something I used to make and decided to try it again. I made a few changes/additions and it came out great. I added carrots and celery, crushed tomatoes, beef bouillon, ground chipotle and a little smoked paprika (It seemed right at the time). I also substituted V8 juice for the tomato sauce. Totally skipped the worcestershire (didn't have any) and the potatoes (I just can't bring myself to have both potatoes and macaroni in the same dish).  Added more water and put in pre-cooked large elbows towards the end. 

The 2 year old finished hers and the 5 year old ate 3 bowls and said to make sure to put the leftovers away so she could have it for breakfast.  It made a ton but there was only one large bowl left after 6 of us. Will make again and maybe next time try with potatoes.

Good, easy recipie.  I used freash green beans & also added fresh carrots.  Instead of tomato sause I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes & 1 can of pureed tomatoes.  I simmered it for an hour & added water when it seemed to be getting dry.  I added the non-cooked noodles with water at the end & cooked for about 10 more minutes.  Turned out good!  Not dry at all; and everything was cooked perfectly (not mushy).

Very very dry if I stuck to the recipie, tho very tasty.  I used corkscrew pasta instead of the elbow macaroni and used less potatoes.  I also added some mushrooms and some more tomatoe sauce as well as some extra water.

I thought this was very good.  I used about 1/2 cup more onion and some garlic salt.  I also cooked the noodles separately and added them towards the end.

Was looking for something that was quick and that I could use ground beef and potatoes with, found this recipe, followed some of the others' advice and made a few changes of my own. It was good, but not one of my favorites... sorry ;( Changes: I did not add noodles, used 5 potatoes instead of 4; two cans of green beans (14.5 oz); one can of cream corn and one can of sweet yellow corn, and a small can of lima beans, more salt and pepper. This was a good recipe to serve the family, meaning kids, so they can get their nutrients, vegetables etc... but not anything enticing for company or guests.....I would cook this again, however, when running out of time and need a hot cooked meal, pronto!

I'm only giving this recipe a 3 instead of a 4 because my husband really complained about the potatoes.  I love them but they aren't part of a traditional goulash.

We really liked this dish. I'm pretty lazy, so I used 2 cans of diced tomatos with basil and garlic instead of the fresh variety. I didn't drain them so I didn't really need the extra water other reviewers are calling for. We'll definitly be making this again.

Pretty good, I guess. Used every ingredient listed. Kind of heavy with both potatoes and pasta. Did have to add a lot more liquid.

The only thing I did differently was to use stew meat (just because that is what I had ) and floured it lightly before browning.  I have since also used a combination of the two, ground beef and stew meat which is also really good.  This is a great recipe and actually reminds me in flavor of my Mom's pot roast which in my opinion was GREAT!
Thank You for sharing Jackye : - )  
ps..this just gets better if you have any leftover!

the two eight oz cans of sauce did't seem to make it moist enough. i would suggest adding a little more sauce and a little more of each spice.

Very good. I did substitute peas for green beans because my family is not fond of the beans, but it still turned out wonderfully. The only thing was that I needed to add quite a bit of water continuously to make sure it didn't burn as it was simmering (I think I added about four cups overall), and I added some more salt and pepper at the table. Easy to make, my family liked it, and there were lots of leftovers for lunch! I will definitely make this again.

This turned out really good.  It was the first time my mom had hamburger goulash, and she loved it!!!!  However, I did not add the green beans and it still turned out good.  I also added finely grated sharp chedder cheese it it just gave the goulash more depth.  I doubled the recipe, and it took about 2 hours to make.  Delicious!!!!

It wasn't wonderful like I hoped. It was ok for an occasional dish but I wouldn't make it every week. I also had to add more water to the recipe.

I make this, but put a little bit of soy sauce in it, and do not put potatoes in it. Instead I put a little bit of instant rice! Its so good.

This was good, and better the second day. We liked it, but there wasn't really anything wow about it. I did add a bit of heat though for our preference. If I made it again, I might leave out the potatoes. It seemed like a lot of carbs.

we liked this fairly well--7-year-old said it was delicious, husband said it was bland, i say it was super easy to make with ingredients i had on hand and tasted pretty good to boot.  not a particularly exciting or fancy dish, but a good weeknight meal.  leftovers will go well in a thermos for 7-year-old's lunch tomorrow.  i used veggie crumbles instead of ground beef and added beef bouillon powder and extra water, but otherwise followed the recipe.  i sprinkled some shredded cheddar on before serving.

Excellent!! The whole family raved about this one with the changes recommended here in the reviews. I left out the potatoes because it seemed like a lot of unnecessary starch. I didn't have green beans so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes, but I'd like to try the green beans as I don't think that would be too bad. Either way, it's hard to imagine this dish without the diced tomatoes - they were perfect. I omitted the regular salt and added two tspns of garlic salt instead. I think I'll reduce the pepper to 1/2 tspn next time as it was a bit much for me. I also added a tspn of Italian herbs and I sauted the onions with the meat before adding everything else. And I cooked some spiral pasta seperately before adding to the pot. Yum!

I love goulash and this was a great recipe to start with.  The only thing that I'll change next time is the potatoes, I didn't lik them in it.  Otherwise, it was great!

This was pretty good and very easy...my 2 year old even liked it.  I used 4 large potatoes and did not use the macaroni at all because it would have been too dry.  If you want to add the pasta it would need to be pre-cooked which is probably what the author meant anyway.

Great basic idea but like many other folks I added items. After hamburger onions & peppers are cooked I added two full cups of beef broth, one 14 oz can of petite tomatoes, one 8oz can tomato sauce, a can of drained corn along with the drained can of green beans. I precooked my potatoes & macaroni so it could be added the last fifteen minutes. I was afraid the potatoes wouldn’t cook on simmer and I prefer to control the al dente of the pasta. The usual spices as recommended worked great. Served with cheddar cheese. It was delicious!!  Thanks for all the other notes it helped me a great deal.

Easy Monday night dinner  Wish I had pre boiled the potatoes like I did the macaroni.   I added 1/2 c red wine and quite a bit of water and chicken broth because it was too dry.  Also added grated cheese as another reviewer advised.  It turned out DEE LISH.  The boys loved it!

I made this today, and it was delicious! I took a photo of it and added it, too, because whoever posted the other ones, well, I don't know what they made, but I don't think it was this recipe! I will be making this recipe a lot! I used more tomato sauce than called for, but that may be because of potato size, etc., that I used. Also, it doesn't indicate in the recipe that you should cook the noodles al dente (firm) in boiling water before adding them to the goulash, but common sense would tell you that, I guess. A new cook may end up with some pretty crunchy noodles! This recipe is delicious! Oh! And next time, just because we love them, we'll be adding onions!

My mother made a plain goulash with elbows, onions and catsup/tomato sauce.  I liked the potatoes and basil in this but the corn and the Worcestershire sauce ruined it for me.  I'll stick with my mother's 'bare cupboard' recipe.

The taste is similar to Sheppard’s Pie. I made it in a large pot and used tomato soup instead of tomato paste, added a ½ cup of water to start. Did not add the green beans... It made a ton of food!

This is a great recipe when trying to get rid of some things in the pantry and freezer and is tasty at the same time! My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I used peas instead of green beans, added a little more water, used 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce (it was just what I had on hand), 1 chopped jalapeno pepper (to give it a little kick) and 1 TBSP of brown sugar. It was WONDERFUL! This is a keeper for us. Thanks!

I thought this was fantastic!  A great meal for a cold, snowy day.  Instead of adding water, I used 1 can of beef broth (I like a thinner gravy).  Also, after reading the other comments, I added green peppers, chopped tomatoes and tabasco.  This is a great dish and super flexible.

This recipe was alright. Some people said it was bland, so I added a can of diced tomatoes With green chiles, some italian seasoning, green pepper, and red pepper. I also left out the potatoes. Still, after adding all of this stuff, it still seemed a little bland! Not sure if I will make it again or not.

Pre-cooking the pasta is a must in this recipe. I also added one half of a green pepper, and a cup of water to this recipe, because I made it with "puree" instead of sauce.
Very good recipe, will make again. thanks.

This was good. I added 1c. water before simmering and 1c.more water when I added pasta.  I added pasta after 45 min. instead of an hour because potatos were done by then and I was pressed for time.  Next time I will substitute diced tomatos for green beans.

I wasn't really into this dish at all.  It was too mushy.  If you do make this then think about adding a can of tomatoes or tomatoe sauce.  Definitely also cut out the potatoes.

Wish I'd read reviews before making. There wasn't enough liquid to cook the macaroni. My family loved it. I added fresh tomatoes from our garden. I will make this again, but I'll add water or pre-cook the macaroni.

I had to add 1C of water while it was cooking and another 1/2C of water after I put the noodles into it (we live at high altitude). I substituted carrots for green beans based on my family’s preference. My husband asked for seconds, normally he is not a fan of one-dish meals, but he commented, "it really doesn't look that appetizing but it tastes really good". I will make this again, I would like to try it without the potatoes and add more noodles.

I thought this recipe was very easy and good.   I however added 1/2 cup of water
to the mixture when I got it all together, and another 1/2 cup after I added the 
macaron.  But all in all it was very tasty.  I highly recommend it to everyone.

The pasts took quite a while to cook at the end. I might add it earlier in the process, include 1 cup water or raise heat. however, really delicious;  we all had seconds!

Had to add water to cook it all together and then some marinara as well bc it was too dry. Other than that it was pretty good.

Overall good dish. Wasn't a fan of the potatoe but otherwise good. Added a bit more worstershire sauce to off balance the tomatoe flavor. Plus it was the only salt I put in.

I just cant seem to get this right.  I've made it a couple of times and it always comes out with potatoes a little too al dente, and everything else too mushy.  I'd use half the black pepper,  maybe half the potatoes; twice or thrice the sauce and serve the noodles on the side.  Let it simmer with just the potatoes for half the cook time, and then add the corn and green beans.

Definitely make it again,  didn't have tomato anything, so used mushroom soup instead, used garlic minced flakes, and instead of potatoes used bisquick and made dumplings.  Turned out amazing :)

Easy recipe. Quick if you prep everything. Seemed a little tasteless without some sarabachi in your bowl. BTW potatoes take longer to cook in current recipe. At lest 30 to 45 minutes longer. Will try again.

Easy and delicious.  I used 1lb burger, fried it with the onions, drained and added 1 can tomato soup (didn't have sauce) and 1 can fire roasted tomatoes and 1/2c water.  Cooked with 2 T Italian seasoning, 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 bay leaf for 20 minutes. Added 1 1/2 c. gluten free pasta and add'l water as necessary. It had great flavor. The kids loved it, especially with mozzarella and parmesan on top.

They say you eat with your eyes. The photo used for this recipe, makes it look repulsive. I would choose a better one to make it look appetizing. One with some sharp colors in it. But overall this was a great recipe.

It took me an hour to get this meal ready to simmer.  I added a cup of water, per the comments.  Also, I added the macaroni in the beginning because it wasn't at the end of the recipe.  After an hour of simmering, the potatoes still weren't done.  While the flavor was good, I won't be making this again.

Made it as is. No changes or omissions. Husband said it was "really good". It could go with or without the macaroni. I did find the salt + garlic salt was a little too much salt for us. But that can be easily changed next time!! This recipe will be staying in the recipe box!!

Good ingredient list with the exception of zero water. This recipe is impossible to make if you follow the instructions.  I added 2 and 1/2 cups of water throughout the cook and it still finished really dry.

This has become a family favorite! love it. I use a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of tomato sauce. Don't use French sliced green beans or they will disappear! Only cook for 40 minutes then add pasta and cook till that's done.

Very tasty! I only put in 3 potatoes and that was still too many--and I cooked it for an extra 40 minutes and the potatoes still weren't done. I though I cut them into small enough pieces. Maybe not. And maybe it was supposed to be 4 small potatoes? Also, I inadvertently doubled the amount of chopped onions, which was fine; but then I love onions. All in all I enjoyed this one and it was very easy!

Definitely need a big pot for this one. A medium sized one is hard to cook in. I added a 1/2 cup of water. The next time I make it I would only use 3 potatoes and add more pasta sauce. Tasted kind of bland for my first time making it.

I thought this was pretty good!  Instead of tomato sauce, I used homemade spaghetti sauce, 1 can of rotel tomatoes, and 1 small can of hot enchilada sauce!  I also added minced  garlic and cumin.  I didn't use potatoes!  Clearly, we like spicy!

I made this recipe tonight and was delicious.  I did make a few changes like others did and just wanted to voice my changes also.  The original would have been great but I just wanted to experiment some.  I left out potatoes and listed are my ingredients: Onions, gr. pepper, hamburger, green beans, okra, cabbage, kidney beans, can of tomatoes with olive oil and garlic, can of tomato sauce with 3 cans of water, cup of chicken broth.  Spices I just threw in (thats how I cook- lol)  salt,pepper, lemon pepper, papricka, italian seasoning, worchestershire sauce, thyme, chili powder.  Just dumped all in, let boil 15 min and simmer bout 20-30 min.  Could of either eat by itself or with rice or spaghetti.    Delicious...........

Gluten free goulash!  I can't eat wheat and was pleased to see this as an alternative to the goulash I grew up with.  Tasty and easy.

I made sure to read the other reviews prior to making this dish and I am glad I did, I did need to add water and since I had no Worcestshire sauce on hand I used Soy sauce instead, otherwise followed followed instructions and it was very, very good. My three year old gave it a thumbs up! Thank you.

Surprisingly, my wife loved it!  Usually, she's very skeptical when I try a new recipe. I did take into consideration, the other reviews.  I added water, also used some tomato cocktail juice and a blood mary mix, canned mushrooms and only 2 potatoes and a fresh tomato.  Oh yeah, used leftover pasta in place of elbows.  It still came out great!

Yum!  I'm glad I made a bunch because we are already looking forward to leftovers. I substituted a turnip for the potato, added olives and sprinkled cheese and french fried onions.  I have a feeling I'll be making this one a lot!

I made this for dinner last night & after some changes, this was very yummy!  Per my sister's advice, I added the cheese packet from Kraft Mac N Cheese, boiled the noodles separate & KEPT them sep (add as you eat - keeps leftovers from being mushy).  Used Italian style diced & stewed (pureed) tomatos, lima beans, kidney beans.  The great thing about Goulash is you can use whatever you want!  Great starter recipe though!

Well, I just got up from the dinner table....my son didn't like it, but my daughter did.  My husband and I thought it was OK.  I put 2 15oz cans of tomatoe sauce in before I discovered that it was supposed to be 2 8oz, but I didn't have any trouble with the potatoes or macaroni cooking.  I added 2T of worcestershire sauce.  I think next time I would leave out the potatoes and add 2-3 Cups of the macaroni.  It also needed a ton of seasoning.  I added much more salt and pepper plus garlic powder, onion powder, roasted garlic and tabasco.

Since I just had a kidney transplant - I have to really watch my salt intake.  With this recipe, I left out all salt called for, used no salt added tomato sauce and green beans.  That left it tasting bland - so I added a lot of seasoning.  I also had to add nearly 3 cups of water while it was simmering, as 16 ounces of tomato sauce was not enough liquid to cook the potatoes in.  It also took over an hour and a half of simmering to cook the potatoes, and I sliced them thin.  Next time I may use canned potatoes so it will be ready quicker.  It did turn out very good - my husband had thirds the first night we had it!

This was a pretty good basic recipe for goulash. I added a lot more seasoning, italian blend and black pepper, and more noodles. I also omitted the corn as that sounded odd. You do need to add water as others have said.
