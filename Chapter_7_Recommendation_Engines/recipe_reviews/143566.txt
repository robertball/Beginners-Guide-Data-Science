This is wonderful. I served it at a party and everyone raved about it. I give it 5 stars.

0 star's if recipe followed. Modified............. great. DO NOT FREEZE! Prepare as suggested, but simply cool in fridge for a few hours before serving. Thank goodness we made it, loved licking out the bowl, and sampled it after following the freezing directions. YUCK! Before serving, we totally thawed it in fridge and it was awesome.

For dieters, this is a great summer treat!  But why not go all the way?  Drizzle some sugar-free chocolate over the top and garnish with a cherry, just like a soda shop!
