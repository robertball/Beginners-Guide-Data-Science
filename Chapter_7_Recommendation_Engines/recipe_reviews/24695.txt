I Love this recipe with Blackberries That's the way my mom made it when I was little. I couldn't remember how she did it. I was so happy to see this one on line. The first bite was like going back in time. I will try the Blueberries too. But, makes a delicious blackberry dessert. I altered the recipe a little my husband has heart disease so, instead of lard I used olive oil. Fantastic.

We went out early this morning to pick blueberries, and when we got home we both wanted something made with blueberries NOW.  I whipped this up quickly, and in no time we had a delicious, satisfying blueberry fix, even without an ice cream topping. I can't wait to dive into the leftovers.  Shortening worked fine instead of lard.

This is simple and tasty.  To make the dumplings come out a little more tender and delicious, add a little less than 1T more lard or shortening, and zest some lemon rind into the dry ingredients before adding the milk.  Then, only stir the milk in until the dry ingredients are moist- don't stir and stir.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Very quick and easy to make. Really loved the blueberry sauce. So good with vanilla ice cream. The dumplings have potential but I found them too heavy and not very flavourful. Used butter instead of lard. A lighter dumpling with some vanilla & lemon zest added would make a huge difference.

While this was very easy and good, I think I would use a different dumpling dough next time--this one was a bit too dense and doughy for me. I used vegetable shortening instead of lard, for the record.

Oh, this is soooo good. It is now a family favorite. I made it while camping and it just tasted wonderful. I added 2 T sugar to the dumping mixture. This is definitely Comfort Food.

We have been making these for as long as this recipe has been posted and we LOVE THEM !  I have made these in mass quanities for church breakfasts as well.When you need to make lots of them, use aluminum pans and bake instead.

Ive never baked dumplings before... didnt really know what to expect. I added vanilla and used half brown sugar. I also added lemon zest to the dough which was a good move as it added flavour. I would serve it with real whip cream.

These are good!  And they are easy to make.  I do wish I had used a larger pan.  My stove is a mess.  But I think they're worth it.  When making dumpling dough, be sure to only stir as much as necessary to get the ingredients to stick together.  Kneading and over mixing is not necessary.

This turned out rather badly. I had to add more than twice the 2/3 cup of milk the recipe called for to get a consistency softer than wood. The dumplings were tasteless, even after adding 2 T of sugar - I would have added a good jolt of vanilla. The dumplings were extremely dense . All in all, I'll look for another recipe for future dumpling dishes.

This was quick, and perfect for a treat after skiing all day!  It was delicious and satisfied the crowd of hungry athletes!  No leftovers here!
