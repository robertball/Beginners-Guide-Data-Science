I like everything about this mug doughnut, especially the cinnamon flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it 2 minutes, but it was too long for my microwave because the end product was a little tough. I just know to cut the time down next time. There's a fine line with mug cakes - too long and they're tough; not long enough and they're not done. It's just experimenting with my microwave to find out the perfect time. I do think all doughnuts should be glazed, so I added a powdered sugar glaze afterwards. Totally delicious!

I was looking for an applesauce muffin in a mug, but looking at the ingredients, I felt this recipe would fit the bill. Here's what I did: substituted egg beaters for the egg and a heaping spoonful of Whitehouse chunky applesauce for the oil. other than that, I followed the recipe and it was perfect! I drizzled a little agave nectar on top, but I believe that this would have been just as good plain. The perfect Doughnut (or muffin) in a mug !

It was good. I think it needed a lot more sugar but then again, I have a little sweet tooth! I added some honey and powdered sugar on top to make it sweeter. Definitely will try this recipe again with more sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe though,

It had the texture of a sponge--and the taste was not any better.

I really liked this it was almost heavenly. The things i changed where substituting the milk for water and putting about 1/4th of a teaspoon of vanilla extract into it. i also put fruit on it in an attempt to make it healthy...

Made it as-is, no toppings, and really enjoyed it. Moist, fluffy, and flavorful! Microwaved for 2 minutes 10 seconds worked best in my 1000 watt microwave. 17 y.o. gave it 4 stars, 14 y.o. gave it 7 out of 5. 2 y.o. got distracted by bacon.

Weirdly awful - better described as a rubbery microwave dumpling.

This isn't my favorite mug dessert, it was OK. However, my 3 year-old liked it and kept saying, "yummm."  My first attempt was a total disaster, but that was my fault. The recipe states a large mug, and the mug I chose wasn't very big. The second time around, I used a bigger mug, and it cooked up nicely in 90 seconds. I think it's a bit bland and needs a topping--I sprinkled lots of cinnamon sugar on mine.

Sooo, this isn’t really like a donut, it’s very spongy. It’s good. Just really like a donut. It’s good with some milk and it’s a fine mug cake in general. But it’s not something I’d go outta my way to eat.

I love the addition of cinnamon in this mug cake! For me the recipe was too sweet the first time I made it so the second time I omitted the white sugar and it was great. My microwave takes less than 60 seconds as it was fully cooked at a minute. I added almond extract to the batter with crunchy peanut butter and maple syrup as toppings, it was divine!!

I used the substitutions (1/4 tsp baking powder added to non-self-rising flour, vegetable oil for olive oil), and also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk rather than dairy milk. It was delicious.

It was very easy to make, but I have to say I was disappointed. It came out of the microwave with a thick texture, the opposite of fluffy and light. 
It also tasted like an egg. The taste improved when I added sugar on top and splashed on a little heavy whipping cream, but still not what you call 'good'. I don't think I will be making this again.

This is a great breakfast, however it's a bit gluggy and dry. I added lots of cinnamon sugar to it and it was much nicer.

Good. Next time I'll just add a bit of salt.
