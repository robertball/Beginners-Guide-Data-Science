I love this drink - I make it in a punch bowl for my annual Mardi Gras party.  After making it by the recipe I've made some adjustments that make it potent but not killer!  I mix 1 1/2 Cups each of light run, dark rum, coconut rum and then 1 cup each of chambord and triple sec and then 4 - 4 1/2 cups of OJ.  I went through 4 punch bowls this past Saturday and people were looking for more!! Thanks for the recipe.

Although traditional hurricanes are a good bit sweeter and a little less strong, this has become my and my husband's favorite! I recently hosted a NOLA themed luncheon and served these as the cocktail. It was a huge hit. Be forewarned! It does pack a huge punch with the final product being about 50 proof (as much liquor as a straight shot of most whiskeys). I've made this as directed with great results, and I suggest trying it that way first before changing the recipe to taste. I've also, though, made a few alterations to taste (and liquor availability). Adding an additional part orange juice doesn't change the taste that much. I've also substituted raspberry schnapps for Chambord when it was out in my local store with no taste change. If you want to make a big batch, as I did for a get together, it does keep very well pre-mixed in a sealed container in the refrigerator for about two days.

WOW!!! What a kick. I found that adding five parts orange juice really cuts nicely into this drink and makes it drink much smoother. Also, these proportions allow two smaller (12 oz.) servings.

Very tasty but dangerous.  Do not drink and drive.  A terrific drink to celebrate Fat Tuesday at home!

This was VERY strong.  I don't think I will make again. I used OJ and fruit punch and my friend liked alot.  I have had better drinks. Too sweet and strong.

Over 20 years ago I was caught in a real hurricane.  If you drank this as a regular-sized drink you might just end up being a disaster area like the hurricane I was caught in.  Mrs. Spunky said this was something she might have drunk and enjoyed 35 years ago (and probably did) but not today, for the same reason.  Hurricanes are strong, and so was this.  That being said, this made a decorative and tasty mini-drink, which in small doses is good and fun to share with friends, especially when they see that seven different liquors go into it.  As for us, we’re wimps – between the two of us together, we split half a drink.

Wow oh wow!! My husband and I aren't big drinkers and this drink packs a firm punch! Way too much alcohol for my taste and I had to delude it with more orange juice to even make it drinkable.
My husband only drank 1/2 a small glass. If I make this again, I'll not use 3 different rums, just one will do.

One of these and I was done drinking for the night. I used 1 of the small 50ml bottles each with a splash of triple sec with about 4 oz of oj. I did notice that that drink had less of a kick when the triple sec was left out. I would advise that you either share one of these or pace yourself. More than one could get ugly.

made this for a small mardi gras soiree following dawn's recipe (2/27/06) for a punch bowl's worth. it was tasty but definitely potent and one of those drinks that goes down waaaay too easy. everyone loved it but were thankfully responsible (except for me - but i wasn't going anywhere). would definitely make again, tho possibly add more OJ and a little less booze just so people could enjoy more of it.

I made this as written but my husband and I who btw drink regularly, could not drink this without doubling the orange juice and adding grenadine.  I made the mistake of drinking way too much and paid for that by missing work and sleeping the sickness off for half of the next day!  Although this is a good drink it will be a while before I try it again !
