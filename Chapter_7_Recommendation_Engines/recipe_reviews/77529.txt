We really liked this one.  Following another reviewer's suggestion, I used 2 cans of salmon so it was super easy to prepare and I did not have to get anything special from the grocery store.  This is a terrific mid-week meal.  I do not have italian seasoning so I used oregano, basil, salt and pepper.  I also made a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce by adding cayenne, salt, pepper and some juice from the capers to some mayo.

Really, really good!!!  Similiar to most recipies, this one is flexible so I used 3 eggs. Because I didn't have freshly cooked salmon (which would have been wonderful), I used 3 cans of Sockeye and used some fresh herbs..also I used lemmon pepper..and that made a big difference. What really grabbed my guests...I served this dish with Mango Salsa!!!  Wow!

Delicious!  I left the mushrooms out as one suggested and I used a bag of OreIda shredded potatoes - just thawed and mixed in. I did also add a little lemon pepper - very tasty.  My two little ones - age 2 and 5 loved them too.  They used ketchup to dip, my husband and I liked the suggested dip of Mayo, cayenne, salt, pepper, and juice from jar of capers.  Thanks for sharing this one. I just had some leftover grilled salmon I wanted to use for something different.

This was a great recipe!  However I did change a few things around...  Instead of the Italian seasoning I used lemon pepper seasoning. I also left out the capers, banana peppers and mushrooms.  Instead I used only red pepper, yellow onion and shredded carrot.  Served with a little garlic mayo and steamed broccoli!  Delicious!

Fantastic! These were exceptional. I omitted the mushrooms and banana peppers, added two minced shallots, and used two cans of sockeye salmon instead of fresh. Served it with a mixture of mayonnaise, paprika, mango chutney and chipotle pepper. Placed on a bed of mixed field greens, this would be easily served in a high class restaurant! 
Well deserved of the five out of five stars.

These were absolutely awful. Usually I don't give recipes such a low rating but these weren't even edible. They fell apart no matter what modification I made to them. I fried them as directed, but they turned out entirely too heavy, I then baked them with a little bit of oil- and they were awful. The only thing I can think to do is cook the potatoes before hand to make the cakes a little squishier.

I’m not the biggest fish person but I absolutely enjoyed this recipe. Don’t let it fool you but there is actually a good serving of vegetables within each salmon cake! This was a pretty easy recipe to make as well. It would have been excellent with cooked flaked salmon as mentioned in the recipe but I only had canned which worked out fine. When you cook these, don’t be afraid to get a really good golden brown on each side. This way it will have a crispy shell with a tender interior. What really brings this together is the topping. I chose mayonnaise and sriracha which was a heavenly combination for this dish.

Very yummy! I left the mushrooms out, feeling that might add more moisture to the mix. I think I might bake them next time too or do them in the omlette maker...I am not used to cooking in oil anymore and found that made it a little heavy. However, that said, the flavour was just delicious and I was ecstatic to find the recipe for us people who are too slack to boil the potatoes first!

I personally would give this recipe a 3 star rating and call it uninspired and bland.  It tastes like potatoes and salmon, just boring.  It was easy to throw together with canned salmon however.  It gained a star when my 7 year old told me this was one of the best things we've ever had for supper and my husband also said they were really good.  I also did like them better reheated the 2nd day.

Left out Italian seasoning, mushrooms, and banana peppers. Used dill to season instead. A little taste of last summer with frozen salmon and garden potato.

These are the best salmon patties I have ever made. For simplicity and budget, I used canned salmon (the bone in kind) and room temp frozen hash browns. I did leave out the bell and banana peppers since they aren't something my family likes. I would not have liked them with the peppers, the added spice was not needed with the other flavors, so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I've tried other fish cake recipes and this is by far the best one yet! I tested both baking and frying methods of cooking:  I preferred the baked cakes. I coated cup cake pans with butter, filled them with the mixture and drizzled a little melted butter on each cake. Goes great with sweet chili sauce :-)

These were wonderful.  I had some fresh salmon that really needed to be used and decided to give it a try.  I grilled the salmon, let it cool, then shredded.  DH and I don't care for bell peppers, didn't have the banana peppers. and I'm allergic to mushrooms -- so left all of them out.  Didn't miss them at all.  Seasoned the bread crumbs with a little Italian seasoning, and let them chill just a bit before frying.  My only complaint was that the the cakes were a little greasy after frying.  Next time will try sautéing them with cooking spray and finish in the oven or bake the cakes and then finish under the broiler to get the crust.  The crust is an important part of this dish.  They reheated wonderfully!  Thanks for the recipe, Nathalie1.

I have made these fishcakes twice now.  I agree with the comments these are tasty but a bit on the bland side.  I also ommitted the mushrooms, banana peppers and capers.  I added a bit of sambal hot sauce to this recipe, dijon mustard, and yellow mustard.  This jazzed it up a bit.  I fried the fishcakes in just a little bit of coconut oil covered with a lid on medium heat. They were nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside not heavy at all.  I did not use any dipping sauce other than yellow mustard.  The chipolte mayo sounds like a great idea.  What I love about this recipe is that you used shredded p;otatoes and don't have to go to the trouble of cooking and mashing the potatoes ahead of time.

I didn't have some of the ingredients so I just made it up as I went along.  I used only 1 can of salmon.  I added another egg because  it really wasn't sticking together.  I grated a little bit of carrot and used the green onions. I added garlic.  I also made a mayo sauce which was nice to dip it into.  (Mayonnaise, garlic powder, lemon juice, pepper and parsley)  Dill would be nice with it too.  My teenagers said that's" gross, why can't you make normal food".  Well they ate it and liked it.  I served it with a kale salad.  I will make it again and next time I'll make sure to have all the right ingredients.  I would probably not add mushrooms though.  I think that would make them to watery.

These were good (left out the capers because I can't stand them) but I have to admit, the presence of the potato wasn't really noted. I think next time I'll go ahead and cook the potato and have it on the side.

This was really good. Used frozen, shredded (thawed) hash browns, chopped green onions, one can of salmon.  Lemon pepper and Italian seasoning.  Maybe add more breadcrumbs and/or a 2nd egg.  They didn’t fall apart but I had to be very careful.

I made it...minus the mushrooms.  I love mushrooms but they didn't sound right for this recipe.  The shredded potatoes,  the key to this being a really good recipe.

I made this for my family of 5 and it was a huge hit.

I used 5 potatoes, 4 eggs, 1 can of Salmon (only 1/2 cup of banana peppers but I wished I had used more!), and because I did not have bread crumbs available, i used the equal amount of Nutritional Yeast Seasoning. These were simply delicious! We are now fighting over the leftovers.

I sautéed the veggies first and used one can of salmon.  I used chopped pickled jalapenos and the capers.  The flavour was really nice but I found it made 8 patties and I used very little oil to fry them in.  I cooked them about 10 minutes for each side (not 3) to be sure the potatoes were cooked.  Would make again.

I used canned chunk Salmon & diced Anaheim peppers. Grilled then put in ciabatta bread & grilled as a panini. I had some left over and later put that in baby romaine for a lettuce wrap!

Loved this recipe! I followed it pretty closely, although I tend to eyeball rather than measure. Trying to make things healthier these days, so I baked a few just to test it and they were great. I did three of them in my toaster oven at 375 for 20 minutes each side. Used some spray coconut oil on the pan to prevent sticking. They were fabulous! Served with pineapple mango salsa. Delish!

This was an amazing recipe. I like seafood but am not a huge fish eater  especially  if it has a strong fishy taste. .  But saying that with all the ingredients  it wasn't strong at all.  This is definitely a new family favorite.

I changed up the peppers by eliminating the banana peppers for fresh peppers of choice, this way I can change the heat depending on my mood, for hot or mild.

Super easy and quick to make with leftover cooked salmon. Didn’t have capers and banana peppers on hand but still was tasty. Served with freshly made creamy garlic dill salad dressing for salad and as dipping  sauce. Family loved it and will make again!

Oh these were good.  Really good.  I wasn't sure what I was expecting, the capers were an interesting ingredient, but everything was delicious together! Made up a quick aioli of mayo, garlic and lemon juice, paired very nicely with the cake :)  Loved it!

Excellent recipe, Even our 8 year old loves it! Great texture, the flavor is just right and it's easy to make.
