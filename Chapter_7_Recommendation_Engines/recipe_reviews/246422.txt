Excellent recipe! I did lower the temperature to 325 and increase the cooking time to 25 minutes so that I could just leave the oven on and bake a second batch. Will definitely be baking these again! So easy and tasty!

I made this with a few changes given what I had in the house. I used 1/2 cup dried less sugar cranberries instead of cherries. Instead of dates I added chocolate chips. I had sesame seeds so I put them in instead of chia. I also lowered the temp to 325 degrees. Hubbie and I enjoyed them tremendously.

These are good - a nice healthy alternative to white flour/sugar cookies.  I omitted the maple syrup, but added in some chopped up 70% cacao chocolate bar.  I will definitely be making these again.  Glad I found them!

These were delicious. I didnâ€™t have all the ingredients, so subbed dried apricots for the dates, and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla. I loved them! Great recipe to use as a base for other flavors.

Followed the recipe as written. These turned out very moist and delicious! I brought them to work and my coworkers raved over them and asked for the recipe.

These are SO good and I love the no added sugar option! Without the added liquid from the maple syrup, though, the dough is pretty crumbly (I had to work it through with my hands). I added coconut flakes for even more crunch. So delicious as a "Whole 30" breakfast scone or as a dessert drizzled with almond butter!

Made it according to the recipe the first time, except I can't do egg yolks, so substituted for egg yolk replacer and did not add the maple syrup.  They were quite dense, and yummy.  The second time I made them, I wanted more protein, so upped the eggs to 3.  It produced a lighter cookie, and I really enjoyed them also.  I love the crunch of the chia seeds.  I'm new to the paleo thing, and have to cut out sugar also, so this is definitely a winner in my book!  Off to make another batch!
