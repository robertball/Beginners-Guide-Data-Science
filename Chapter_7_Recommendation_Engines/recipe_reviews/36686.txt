This is very good.  Even better if you drain the cottage cheese for about an hour in a colander.  Also, I love to add a thawed, squeezed-out, box of frozen spinach to the cottage cheese, and blend it in the blender.  It's pretty as well as very good for you!  Tastes yummy too.

Delicious! I almost like this recipe better than my regular lasagna recipe that takes forever to make! This is so quick...I used Barilla's no boil lasagna noodles...and so tasty. My family loved it and I love the fewer calories for a change.

This idea has potential but I found it very bland, even though I used roasted garlic sauce and added spinach.  Next time I'll replace the ground round with Italian turkey sausage and mix the cottage cheese and parmesan with egg substitute and herbs.  The no boil noodles were great!  I'll use them again!

My husband who would die if I made him a low fat meal, absolutely loved this lasagna!  I used ground turkey and added about 1/2 cup more cheese.  By using Classico sausage spaghetti sauce, it added another punch of flavor!  We even froze the left-overs to enjoy for a quick meal later!  Try it! You'll enjoy it!

This was fast, easy and very tasty.  I seasoned the ground turkey and added bell peppers to it.

Remember folks- this is a light recipe! Sure, there's not much sauce, cheese,etc.- but for 275 calories it's great! Like the other reviewer said, you get a decent size piece. I added 1 clove of garlic & about 1/2 cup chopped onion to the meat as it cooked. This helps flavor the meat. I also used Muir Glen organic sun-dried tomato sauce- It was wonderful. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. You can have bread or a salad with it & it's still an ultra low cal meal.

Great recipe for easy lasagna!  Also works with American Beauty's oven-ready noodles (uncooked).

This was the best lasagna I have ever made, and it is somewhat healthy for you!  I followed the recipe, although I could not find the low-fat spaghetti sauce, and I added a little more shredded cheese.  This is a keeper!

This was very good.  I used regular cheddar and a little mozzarella.  Quick and easy, and the portion size isn't tiny if you're counting calories.

Maybe I just do not eat high fat lasagna enough, but I appreciated this dish.  I thought it was great.  I did use Mozzerella instead of cheddar, and 1% fat cottage cheese and 93% lean ground beef.  Regarding the sauce, I think the key is to just look for a lower calorie sauce, like 60-90 calories per 1/2 cup and no more than 5 fat grams per 1/2 cup.  I thought it was great and the leftovers are great too!

I know it's a light recipe... but it was sort of dry.  I sort of think it could use a bit more sauce.  Other than that, I liked it.  I actually couldn't find a law-fat sauce, but I know they're out there.  I think it was fun to try to make this, and it was quick, compared to other recipes.  I also used mozarella instead of cheddar, since cheddar is actually a British product.  I think with a few of your own modifications, this is a good dish.

Very easy to make this recipe.  My husband liked it.  I used regular lasagna noodles and boiled  the water myself, because the pre-cooked lasagna noodles were extremely expensive.

I'll take this recipe anyday for the 270 cal. per serving compared to others that are double and triple the calories.  It was a breeze to assemble, and tasted great with no guilt.  Next time I will saute onions and some garlic to put in it.

I made this for dinner tonite. It was my first ever attempt at lasagna and I was impressed. It was very good. However I made alot of my own changes. I made it high fat, didnt have much cottage cheese so i used alot of shredded mozz, I boiled dry noodles instead of buying precooked because it was way cheaper, and made extra sauce out of diced tomaotes. First attemt at lasagna was great! In my opinion the recipe does not call for enough cheese, and sauce, so I doubled it!

I cheated and made a full fat version with loads of extra sauce (Prego italian sausage flavor), mozzarella cheese, and ricotta instead of cottage cheese, so I'm not sure how this recipe was really supposed to taste.  But it was excellent.  I give it 5 stars because it was so easy and so fast, even though I used regular noodles that I had to cook.

So easy to make.  I added cooked spinach to the ground beef a great way to hide extra greens.

This recipe is GREAT. When I fix it I use cheddar AND mozzarella cheese. I also don't use the low fat spaghetti sauce or fat free cottage cheese.

I'm the picky eater in my family, and I enjoyed this recipe. I took the suggestions and added more sauce, and I used lowfat cottage cheese instead of the fat free.

This was OK ~ it was a little dry though. If I try it again, I would add more sauce. I did substitute part-skim mozarella for the cheddar.

This was really easy to make and I made it because it's low-fat and low-cholesterol, but compared to my authentic 'secret recipe' high-fat high-cholesterol lasagna, the entire family was really disappointed.  It was just really bland.
