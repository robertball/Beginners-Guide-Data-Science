I made this recipe but i did some research on what to do to make it set better. First of all don't use liquid pectin that is one of the problems with the recipe and it not setting. Second off don't use ball pectin use sure-jell pectin. I tried both this year to see which one worked best and the sure-jell cost 50 cents more but it's worth it. It started to jell before i could get it strained and into the jars. Which is a good thing The ball pectin did not set fully yet it's only been 4 days but the sure-jell set in 20 minutes. USE SURE-JELL not Ball Pectin!!!

The first time I tried this recipe, I had medium success with the solidification process.  The second time, no solidfication.  What a disappointment.  After researching other jellies, I retooled the recipe and man does this work well.

2 red peppers, ciced
14-20 jalapenos, diced
1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar
2 cups frozen raspberries
7 cups sugar
2, 6 oz. liquid pectin envelopes

Combine peppers, raspberries, sugar and vinegar in pot and bring to a boil, stirring occassionally.  Simmer for 10 minutes.  Add pectin and simmer for one more minute. Remove from heat and sit for 10 minutes.

Ladle into the 8 oz bell jars (sterilized) and process for 10 minutes to seal.

This tastes sooo good and does jelly fine.  Don't strain the fun stuff out either.

5 stars is not enough! We just love this. I have several friends that wait for me to make my Jalapeno Jelly and this is such a perfect twist on that! Great gift material. 

We live in a residential area and grew a  most beautiful black raspberry plant that is an awesome producer. I'm so delighted to find a recipe that combines our love of our raspberries with our Jalapeno peppers!! Ours turned out a grape red, sweet and spicy...I did double the Jalapeno. ;)

This is the first jelly I've ever made. It came out perfect. I used about fifteen jalapenos, 1 green pepper, two cups of frozen raspberries, a whole box of Surejell, and approximtely five cups of sugar. Wow, is it wonderful. Perfect jelly consistency, wonderfully sweet/hot flavor. Just awesome.

Great Jelly recipe! I love it! I made this in December and put the jars in baskets that I made up as gifts.  The people who got them also loved the jelly and wanted the recipe! I did find that the jelly went a little farther than the recipe indicated... I filled three 8 oz. jars instead of just two!

Like other users this did not gel the first time.  The second time I used a candy thermometer and cooked until the temperature of the mixture reached 220 degrees.  I pulled it off the heat, waited a few minutes and then added the pectin and some lemon juice.  -- also note: my other Jalapeno recipes call for liquid pectin.  This resulted in a firmer set, but it is still not the same solid set as say crabapple jelly

If you are having trouble getting it to set, is it possible you are using the boiling canning method?  That was my problem. Then my friends mom told me to fill the hot jars with the hot jelly, turn the cans upside down. The heat will seal the jars. It has set perfectly every time since I started sealing my jars this way.

I approached this recipe by changing a few ingredients; swapped olalaberries for the raspberries, red bell pepper for the green and used serrano chiles instead of jalapeno. I didn't change any proportions and otherwise, followed the recipe to a "t".  

Turned out tasty and very pretty (the red bell peppers really helped keep the color nice and ruby) however, I too had problems with the set and felt the vinegar was a little too prominent.   

My question here is, what the heck was I supposed to do with the mint!? Although it appears in the list of ingredients, the directions don't indicate what to do with it, once you've got it. (I dropped a small sprig into each finished jar just for laughs but don't think that was the intent)  Anyone?

I'm giving this recipe a moderate review - it was a good concept, but the recipe seemed to be missing quite a bit of information.  For instance, what is the yield?  The small type said "one pint."  I got 2.5 pints out of it.  It was a little irritating as I had to quickly sterilize more jars.  Also, the "1/3 (6 fluid oz) container of liquid pectin" was confusing as well.  I ended up using 1 pouch from a 2 pouch pack of Certo.  The results were very good, but the recipe really needs to be edited for clarification.

So good!!!  I made this in hopes of giving it as a gift, and it's something I will be proud to give!  I used bottled jalapeno slices (rather then fresh) threw them in the food processor.  Next time, I will add a few more to give it a little more heat, but the slices worked very well and were much easier to use then slicing fresh peppers.  Great recipe!

Excellent combination of flavors. I doubled the recipe so I could keep some and give to friends. I made the following modifications.
2 cups berries
1 large red or green bell pepper chopped
1/2 cup hot peppers(your choice I used 7 large jalepenos)
6 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups cider vinegar
1 3 oz pectin (sure-jell the best)
1 Tablespoon red pepper flakes

I combined the chopped peppers and 1/2 cup vinegar in a processor til finely chopped. Poured that into the pot with the rest of the ingredients. Brought to boil, boiled five minutes, added pectin, brought to a boil for one full minute. Removed from heat let sit 2 minutes. Poured into sterilized jars processed for ten minutes. Was setting by the time it was completely cooled. 7 cups approx.

For some reason this jelly didn't set for me and I followed the recipe (it tasted pretty good though!). I was really hoping that it would turn out better.  The next time I make jelly, I will probably try again.  For those of you looking for an amazing jelly recipe try the "Red and Green Christmas Jalapeno Jelly" ... now that is another excellent jelly recipe (serve with cream cheese and crackers, yum!)

This recipe is great! I used one 6oz package raspberries and 10 jalapenos, pureed, and did not strain. I cooked to 220 degrees, cooled 5 minutes, added the pectin, then cooked 5 more min. It gelled perfectly! Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed 9/18/06 re iew and did what you are not suppose to do and made a big batch (×3). :  I tweeked it also.
6 cups rasberries
3 extra large green peppers
30 very large jalpenos
5 cups vinegar
7 cups organic sugar
11 Tbls. Ball low sugar pectin
To test that you have inough pectin after your mix is done bowling take a tsp and dip some out, let it cool (frig works fast), then test consistancy. This way you don't mess up the whole batch.
It came out nice and hot like we like it and not overly sweet.

This was my first time making jelly. Kindof fun to do. I tweaked the recipe a little.  I combined between my canning book recipe and this recipe.  It needs a lot more jalapenos than the 1/4 cup full. Next time I will do 3/4 - 1 cup of them. When it came to boiling my book said to boil hard for 10 minutes, then remove from heat, stir in pectin, then place back on burner and bring to boil for 1 more minute.  My jelly turned out great, it set up within 30 mins, just wished I would of put more jalapenos in for some bite.

I made this recipe, but cut down the sugar and added raspberry jello mix along with the pectin to help gel.  It worked great and had lots of compliments!!

This did not gel very well at all, even though I tried to tweak the pectin.  As for the sprig of mint, Like others, also didn't know what to do with it, as the recipe never mentions it later.

Made this a # of times.  It took a couple of hours to set but was wonderful.  I have since changed this recipe and used blueberries instead--OH BOY!!!  Just smush the blueberries a little during the cooking process and if after straining you see the litlle seeds, just use a spoon and skim them off.  Easy enough because its already setting.

I made this Jelly yesterday.  I have had problems with pepper jelly not setting up in the past but wanted to try this one.  I only made 3 changes 1. I doubled it.   2. Didn't have raspberries so used fresh blackberries.  3. I used 2 pouches of liquid pectin.
It turned out beautiful.  I will make this again.

I doubled the recipe on everything except for the sugar (I added 4.5 cups, add to taste), and I used 2 pouches of Bernardin liquid pectin.  Boiled the fruit/sugar/vinegar for 5-10 min, removed from heat, added pectin, boiled for another few minutes.  It did not seem like it was getting thicker, once I filled my jars and let it sit for approx 30 min it gelled perfectly!  Will use chili peppers next time as I think that would compliment the raspberries better than the jalapenos did.

I was so excited to make this jelly, however, it didn't turn out at all.. I even tried one of the other viewers customed ways because they said it finally set but mine turned out runny.. Any suggestions on how to get it to set? I would really love to try again..

I doubled this recipe adding 1 c blackberries ( only had 1 c of raspberries in the freezer) and an extra c of sugar.  Drained the juice from the chopped peppers and did not strain. I brought to a rolling boil for 10 min., used 2 (3 oz) pkg of Ball liquid pectin, rolling boil for another minute.  It came out PERFECT! Tastes luscious, looks beautiful, going to enter in the County Fair. Can't wait to give in special Christmas baskets with my other green Jalepeno jelly. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I followed the instructions using a non-liquid pectin.  I blame my inexperience with making jellies and the fact I completely forgot to strain it as to why it didn't gel up.  I tried to re-process it a 2nd time to get it to jell and got slightly better results but still not quite the consistency I was expecting. I really liked the flavor so I figured I'd give it a try even though they didn't gel right.

At a recent family event I had a jar in the fridge with some cream cheese. When I cam down from the attic EVERYONE was around the breakfast bar eating my jelly with the crackers and cream cheese asking where I'd gotten it. So just a reminder: IT doesn't have to be country fair award winning pretty or perfect to be AMAZING.

I'm planning to make this again keeping notes on what works with the brands I typically use.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used a mix of jalapeno, serrano and one chipotle.  The chipotle adds a great smoky flavor to it.  I also used about 5 c of sugar and had raspberry vinegar on hand which I mixed with the apple cider vinegar.

Great recipe. My husband is diabetic, so I modified recipe and used 1.5 Cups Sugar, and 1.5 Cups Splenda.  Then used the low sugar pectin. Also I didn't strain the mixture.  It turned out great!
Thanks for a good recipe.

It's a good start but the current recipe has to much of a vinager taste to it, and doesn't solidify.  I will continue to work on it and see if I can post some changes for others who may try.

Bad, unsafe canning practices! Peppers are low acid, too many of them in this recipe to be safely canned in a water bath canner which she doesn't even say to do in the directions, leading people to risk botulism, a deadly organism that has no taste, smell or appearance. Just because a jar seals does NOT MEAN IT IS SAFE. Take a canning class or simply pick up a ball book and READ before giving away home canned goods-you can risk your own families safety but don't you dare risk anyone else's with your "gifts".

Love the flavor of this.  A friend gave me a bunch of jalapeno's so went looking for jelly recipes.  I did have trouble wth the jelly setting up.  Not sure why.  First batch was way to jelled and the next one more like syrup.  I just un-jarred both batches and combined them and they are great.  Sure would like to know why they turned out so different.  I some times think jelly is a mystery.

Very easy recipe.  Loved the taste, sweet with just a hint of bite. I used wild raspberries because that is what I had available.  The color is a lovely transparent pink/red. I plan to enter it in my County Fair.  It would be very easy to adjust the amount of heat by adding more or fewer jalapeno seeds in the recipe.

Loved the flavor!  Wonder why, though, green peppers are used in it (is it purely for the color)?  It seems they would add fluid to it when cooked down, thereby making a "set" difficult to obtain, as others have reported!   I didn't have any on hand, so omitted them and it worked great!

I made this with liquid pectin and should not have. It did not set!! Although the flavor was very good I had to discard the whole batch. I used sur-gel on the second batch and it came out perfect. Just make sure you keep it on the heat after adding the pectin.

Recipe works for the most part, but I tweaked a few things and tripled the recipe.  
1.  I used fresh raspberries and packed them into the measuring cup
2.  I used garden Jalapenos (I find them hotter that store bought), but used 7 larger ones.  I kept three largest ones whole, and removed the seeds from the remaining peppers.  I threw it all in the food processor and did not strain anything.
3.  Once the initial boiling (not simmering, but boiling) was achieved, I boiled for 5 minutes, removed from heat, added bernardin liquid pectin and let sit for about 30-45 seconds.  Put back on the heat and waited until a strong rolling boil was achieved.  I boiled it for approximately 8 minutes (I checked every few minutes for consistency by taking a little out in a glass dish and popping it in the freezer.  
Consistency worked out great and it tastes fantastic.  Raspberry flavour with a nice splash of heat.  Perfect! - Made about 4.5 pints

Advice to all, if you are making jalapeno jelly use only CERTO brand pectin.  For some reason others will not jell correctly.  USE A CANDY THERMOMETER!

This is the best tasting "jelly" I have ever made.  Ok, so this was my first attempt.  Despite the fact that mine didn't set, it is great as a sauce!  I took someone's suggestion to leave all of the good stuff in there, rather than straining it, and I am so happy that I did.  It tastes wonderful with cream cheese and crackers!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent Jelly!  I doubled this recipe and after reading the reviews made a few changes - strained the liquid after boiling, then added pectin - boiled for 1 min and canned.  It jelled perfectly!!!

This was my first time ever making jelly and it was so easy I wonder why I hadn't tried it before.  I made 5- 4 ounce jars and I am giving them away for Christmas gifts this year.  Of course I kept a jar for myself and can't say enough about how much I am loving this jelly. It's sweet with just a little zing, awesome in every way. A+

I left the pepper bits in and did not strain the jelly wanting the texture more like jam. I use it on cream cheese bagels right from the jar. The best use i have for it is when i add water to it til it resembles  a sauce and dip cream cheese wantons in it. Omg its amazing

We haven't tasted it yet,  but i'm sure it's good.  I followed the recipe exactly as it reads,  but it only made 3, 1/2 pint (8oz) jars. I thought maybe i read the jar size wrong, but I didn't actually see what size jars to use. I'm assuming it's less than a half pint. Also,  I had no problems with the liquid pectin setting.  It was setting as i was trying to strain it.

Made it 4 times tonight.  It worked perfectly;  it set each time when made as directed.  I have made this before for markets and found that water bathing afterwards sometimes caused the jelly not to set up... or took a couple extra days to set firm.  My husband is very happy.  He loves the jelly and loves to share it at work.  I hadn't made it for a couple years, so had to search for my recipe that I had saved, glad to be reunited.

The vinegar in this recipe is too overpowering, it tastes a lot better if you use fresh squeezed lemon juice instead and use Sure Pectin Powder for setting.
