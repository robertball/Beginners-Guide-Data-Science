Ok, just finished 'enjoying one' --M-I-L-K... must have Milk!  The bittersweet chocolate was a bit strong,overpowering on the flavor.  So, I'd recommend to go easy on the chocolate glaze, change it to milk chocolate, or serve it with vanilla ice-cream.  May want to go with Milk chocolate or Semi-sweet chips for the Cocoa chips for the Brownie mix itself.  On the other hand, the Lemon Frosting was absolutely delicious and could be a Recipe all to itself!

My 10yr old made these by herself and they turned out fantastic.
