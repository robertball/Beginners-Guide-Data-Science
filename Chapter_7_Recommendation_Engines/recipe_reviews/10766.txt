These cookies are pretty good. They taste very buttery and remind me of shortbread in this way. I like them though although they aren't the best I've ever had. I may make them again may not...

these deserve zero stars! Lacking in flavor; a complete waste of ingredients and time.

Oh I so wanted this to be good but was very disappointed.  The recipe as written looked like an adaption of another. I used 1/2 cup white and a 1/2 cup brown sugar and sprinkled some sugar on top but it did not really help.  It needs something but not sure what. The taste was just blah though the texture was nice and cake like.  Wish my review was a different story.
