This recipe was easy to put together, my family liked it and would like me to make it again.  Hi praise from my group.  :)  Personally, I thought the flavor was a little too bland, but then I am used to more fiery food.  Next time I may try adding more curry or the addition of a very little hot sauce.  I will make it again.

4 plus if I could rate it that way. I used more pineapple juice and less honey because that is what I had. My chops were not the really thick ones so I took them out after they tested one. Then reduced the syrup over med high until thick and then added 1 tsp of butter to thin as the sauce needed to go a little further. Sliced super thin and served over a mound of white rice and drizzled with sauce and pineapples. served with fresh cooked carrots and then dipped the carrots in the sauce....wonderful!

This is a unique and unusual recipe, and it really worked for my husband and I.    The curry adds East Indian flavour but no heat, and the allspice and cinnamon provide a West Indian/Caribbean twist.  We used cubed pieces of pork shoulder instead of the chops, and added some carrots and onions to saute after browning the pork.  Very easy and highly enjoyable - what more could you ask for from a weeknight meal?

I decided to try a new recipe again but while I was making this the other nite my guy passed the stove - saw the pineapples in the pan and said "Great - you are making that again - I loved that dish"!  I had forgotten that I tried it before and we ended up loving it a second time.  Thanks submitter.
