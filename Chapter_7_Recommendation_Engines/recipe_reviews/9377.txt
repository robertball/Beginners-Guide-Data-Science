Easy & so good!  I didn't have any winter squash, but I added baby carrots & 
sliced zucchini.  One thing I did different, I put the root vegetables (onion, 
potatoes & carrots) in one bowl & the more delicate vegetables (peppers &
zucchini) in another bowl, they I divided the oil/vinegar/herb mixture between
the two bowls.  I put the root vegetables in the oven first & let them roast for 30
minutes before adding the other vegetables at the last 10 or 15 minutes.  That
way they stayed bright colored & didn't get mushy.  I took them to a potluck dinner
& there wasn't a single bite leftover.  Great, healthy recipe!

Just so everyone knows, the only way to make this recipe and have it turn out well is to use FRESH ROSEMARY AND THYME! I made the mistake thinking that it wouldn't be a big deal using dried...but I was wrong.  I've read so many good things about this recipe to only have it turn out pretty bad.  The dried thyme overpowered the taste of the dish. I may make this again (using fresh spices) but I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the veggies I just made. Either way, it was a learning experience!

This recipe was SO good! I really had never found a good way to roast vegetables that didn't sound complicated (put this veggie in, take this one out, lower the temp, put the oven on broil, stir every 3 minutes...), until now! I took this dish to my brother's house, and they wanted to keep all the leftovers! The only thing I did differently was to omit butternut squash, and up the ratio of balsamic vinegar to olive oil. Oh, I also used salt and pepper in the dressing. I used 1 large red onion, 1 sweet potato, 3 new potatoes, half a bag of baby carrots, grape tomatoes, crimini mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, and I used dried rosemary, thyme and basil (I already had dried) for the seasonings. I did the root vegetables on one foil-lined baking pan, and the more delicate veggies on another pan. I found mine burned after about 15 minutes at 475, so I lowered the temp. to 450 and just cooked longer. With the addition of the time in the oven at 475, the root vegetables took about 45-50 minutes, and the other veggies took about 25-30, stirring both. 
This recipe tasted SO good, though, and I have gotten requests to make it for holidays and other family gatherings. Thanks for sharing it!

Yum! You can use almost any kind of vege in this dish except delicate veges that will fall apart easily. I tossed all the veges, vinegar and spices in a bag before roasting. Tend to dry out so I cover the pan for the first half of cooking and then leave it exposed for the 2nd half to get the nice brown color.

Really good, healthy dish.  The only problem I had was the potato's took a long time to cook, while everything else was done.  By the time the potato's were soft enough, the other veggi's were a little too soft.  Next time I'll cut the potato's smaller than everything else and that will probably solve the problem.

FANTASTIC!  What a wonderful way to bring out the vibrant colors, and flavor of vegetables; such a versatile recipe.  I forwent the sweet potatoes and squash, and don't care for rosemary so omitted those.  Used red potatoes w/skins instead of yukons, and added some fresh broccoli.  The broccoli was to die for roasted!  I kept all measurements the same except had to add a bit more EVOO.  I added some garlic powder(was afraid to add garlic cloves for fear of burning and becoming bitter) and added 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. dried crushed thyme.  (didn't have fresh) Fresh cracked pepper and salt at the end.  This is just perfect.  Did it in big roaster pan and just loosely covered w/foil and turned every 10 minutes as stated for the 35 and they still browned while I think that bit of foil just loosely laid overtop helped them 'steam' a bit and no veggie was too crunchy or mushy.  Served w/oven-broiled lamb and baguettes and it was a complete meal.

We loved this.  Substituted carrots for the squash and reduced the oil just a bit.  Started the potatoes about 10 minutes before the other vegetables, then cooked the 35 minutes.  Just a hint:  mix the oil, vinegar, herbs and spices _before_ you start chopping and the flavors blend a little and the rosemary softens.

We will definitely make this often.  Thanks, Saundra.

This is definitely a great veggie side dish! I made it for a dinner party and it was a hit! You can't go wrong if you follow all the instructions exactly. Using a shallow roasting pan is a must, along with frequent stirring. I'd also like to add that spraying the roasting pan with a non-stick spray prevents all the sticking that happens in the later stages of cooking.

Absolutely fabulous dish! The colors are so vibrant and the flavors are wonderful - it's such a great way to enjoy veggies! I cut back a bit on the oil and lined my foil roasting pan with a bit of Pam so nothing would stick. If you don't have fresh herbs on hand go ahead and use dried. I did have to cook this a bit longer than the cooking time indicated, you know it's done when the veggies can be pierced with a fork. Very healthy, and very good - a perfect side dish!

Yum, yum, yum! I enjoyed this dish and plan on making it again. Based upon previous reviews the only changes I made were to use carrots instead of squash and to throw in some fresh garlic cloves. In the future I will probably cut the fresh rosemary in half. This is a great healthy side dish and goes a VERY long way. I highly recommend this dish.

I roast my vegetables as much as possible at 400 degrees with olive oil and salt.  Sweet potato, potato nuggets, carrots but most important, brussel sprouts which are the best. One thing I notice when reading allrecipes is that no one recommends using parchment paper which means no cleanup and the vegetables brown beautifully. I use parchment for all baking whether it be cookies, creamed fish, meats, etc.

This dish is wonderful.  Made exactly as stated.  I would like to say something concerning ratings though.  If a cook deviates significantly from a recipe and then finds that it is horrible, they should not be able to rate!  You are not rating this recipe, you're rating your own version.  Some deviation is normal, but significant changes the recipe totally and your rating is nill.

If you are looking for the quickest, easiest, best tasting recipe of roasted vegetables, look no further! I've been trying to find a good recipe for a long time, and tried many variations, but this is the absolute best.  I made it in a 450F preheated oven for about 45 mins with gold potatoes, squash, yellow onion, red bell pepper, and carrots, using dry rosemary, thyme, basil, just a pinch of garlic powder and red pepper, salt+pepper,  and balsamic vinegar and corn oil (was out of olive).   Some tips: Balsamic vinegar (not lemon), red bell pepper, and basil are a must for me in this recipe, all the other ingredients can be added or subtracted depending on what you have on hand. If using dry herbs, use about 1/4 of what the recipe calls for (proportions in the recipe are for fresh herbs). When making the seasoning mixture, you will know the right amount of salt when the mixture tastes a little salty and the sour taste goes away a bit. Use a large shallow pan, loosely cover with foil, and gentry stir the veggies every 10 mins.   I did not separate the veggies into different bowls, and did add the squash. I diced the squash into large peaces, and it turned out perfectly! It was not mushy at all, but completely cooked through.  The dish turned out beautiful, good enough for a weeknight dinner or to entertain guests. All the veggies were evenly browned, very moist (but not greasy), and aromatic. I surved the veggies with roasted chicken, and there were no leftovers.

Delicious!  Love the addition of balsamic vinegar.  I usually just do oil and rosemary but the balsamic really kicked the flavor up a notch.  **On a side note, I highly recommend either dropping the temp significantly or using a different oil.  Olive oil has a very low smoke point of 325.  When oil smokes, it releases carcinogens into the air and free radicals within the oil. Not good!  I cooked mine at 425 with canola oil which has a higher smoke point. Just something to keep in mind if you are concerned about these kinds of things.

Delicious! I made this to go with a roasted chicken seasoned with "essence of emmeril"! I added carrots quartered lengthwise, and drizzled the drippings from the roasted chicken over the top before cooking. 
Due to my cutting everything into long wedges, it took about 50 minutes. 
I suppose those with a southern taste for their veggies might  like them cooked quite a bit longer till soft. 
Note: As a general culinary school rule, fresh to dry is usually 3 to 1, one tablespoon fresh equals one teaspoon dry, and if the dried has been sitting around awhile, you might want to add a bit extra. Give the dried herbs time to absorb some of the liquids before the cooking process for best results...

Yum! Roasting veggies is soo ez and really brings out their flavor! It irritates me however when someone gives a 2 Star review because they used dried herbs instead of fresh as recipe calls for! Make recipe first AS WRITTEN if you plan to give an honest review!

The veggies taste really good. HOWEVER, one should not that you should use a disposable pan for this OR use tin foil on the baking sheet. The Balsamic become so carmalized onto the pan, that it took me forever to get it clean...

perfect, perfect, perfect............ and the beauty of this recipe is that you can use whatever vegetables you like or have on hand. Hands down my favorite way to eat vegetables. I make this all the time and have now for several years. I do double the amount of extra virgin olive oil and toss the vegetables in a plastic grocery produce bag to evenly coat them. I also use garlic sometimes, oregano, fresh parsley, cumin, the combinations are endless. Saundra, kudo's to you, I use this recipe more than any other one on this site.

Yummy. And so good for you. I can snack on veggies, this recipe makes it so easy to. Fresh herbs make a world of difference. It takes a little more effort to get the leaves off the stem, but it will make or break this recipe. The OIL needs to be DRASTICALLY REDUCED. Not even to half the 1/4 c but a couple tablespoons to lightly coat. I used about half of what the recipe called for, as I thought the 475 degree temp called to bake the veggies would require it to keep from burning, but as I was pouring the 1/4c it still seemed an outrageous amount of oil. So I amended to half of what the recipe called for and it was still too much for me, in my opinion. Unless I'm frying I use oil in tsp/tbsp measurements. My only other suggestion is stick to robust vegetables, that can handle that high of a temperature. I would omit the bell pepper or add in the last 10-15 minutes. I used sweet potato and squash, carrots, pearl onions, a Vidalia onion (which I'll omit next time - did not hold up in the heat) and cauliflower which turned out beautifully at the suggested bake time. As well as asparagus and bell pepper, mushrooms, which I'll add in the last 10-15 minutes the next time. But this is a very yummy staple.

This is a fantastic addition to any meal. The first time I tried this recipe, it took quite a while to bake because the squash takes longer to bake through, so everything else mildly suffered by being a bit over-cooked and vary dark (but still tasty!) The second time around, we had friends coming over, on of them being a very good cook, so I was really trying to impress them. I changed the recipe a bit thoug. I used more EVOO so that the pieces could be coated more and replaced some of the ingredients. I took out the squash and instead added brussel sprouts, left some of the onion separated with more layers and whole garlic cloves (still wrapped in it's skin). I also lowered the temparature of the oven to avoid burning of the onion and covered it with foil for the first 20 minutes or so. It turned out DELICIOUS. Everyone loved it, and garlic becomes a whole different beast when eaten whole once it's been baked~ just melts in your mouth! I will definitely be making more of this to add some sort of healthiness to any of our meals.

I make this almost every week for my family...we love it!  I substitute other veggies (carrots, asparagus, etc.) with great results.  Definitely use balsamic vinegar (NOT lemon juice!) and don't forget to halve the spices if you are doing dried instead of fresh.  Great recipe!

I added other root vegetables (parsnips, carrots, celery root, beets, turnips), several whole cloves of garlic, and left fresh herbs on the stems and placed under vegetables while roasting.
I think 475 degree oven is too high -- I reduced to 400.
I made a day ahead of time and reheated because I knew I would be pressed for time and oven space on Thanksgiving day -- reheated nicely (in 350 degree oven), but if you prepare ahead of time, cut cooking time somewhat, so that when you reheat they don't get too mushy.

This is my go-to recipe for roasted veggies! It's in the oven right now!  I've made it many times and I've used whatever fresh veggies that are in my fridge.  Tonight its potatoes, beets, carrots, onions, and sweet potatoes.  *Just note if using asparagus and broccoli they cook faster, so add them a litttle later.* Yum!

Wow, this dish is fabulous.  I substituted carrots for the squash and small red potatoes for the Yukon Golds, and added asparagus.  Everyone raved.  I used an extra large non-stick roaster pan and sprayed it with Pam... easy cleanup, no stick.  Easy to make for a crowd, just double it.  I used fresh herbs.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.  Will make again!

What a great all-vegetable dish.  I used all the veggies listed except peppers, and I added carrots & mushrooms.  Do spray pan with Pam and stir often to prevent burning - but don't lower the temp as that is what produces carmelization & great flavor.

This recipe is so good and simple. I used red onion, butternut squash, orange and red pepper, purple potato, red potato and yellow nugget potato. (Check out the photo I uploaded) I think that next time I will put less oil and use olive oil infused with roasted red pepper. I will let you know how it goes.

I made a huge amount of vegetables and they were GREAT.  I had a lot to do so I cut the veggies and put them into ziploc freezer backs and added the coating basically marinating them for a couple of hours.  I was worried they'd taste too - well too something.  They didn't.  I did cover them for the first 15 minutes which I think was a good idea.  Must have balsamic vinegar.  Don't even try this without it or rate it without using it.  Using it gives us an unfair advantage over those of you who don't.

This dish was great.  I cooked it ahead of my dinner party as I was concerned about trying to remember to stir every 10 minutes once my guest arrived.  I transfered it out of the roasting pan into a casserole dish, and added parmensan cheese to the top when I reheated.  It received rave reviews from all.  The fresh herbs are a KEY ingredient I think.  Also, I used all summer vegetables, yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms, onion, red and yellow pepper.  I did add salt to the dish as it was cooking and I think it helped to bring out the flavors. Very nice alternative to the standard veggies!

We really enjoyed this, I used 3 potatoes, golds, white and sweet. A yellow onion, green pepper, zucchini and mushrooms.  I did the root vegetables for 30 minutes with 3/4 of the marinade and let the zucchini, mushrooms and green pepper marinate for the 30 minutes in the olive oil, vinegar and 1/4 cup red wine. Stirred all together at the 30 minute mark and cooked another 10 minutes. A perfect meal if you add brown rice !!!

This is a perfect dish.  As vegetarians, we make this as a stand alone dish once a week.  My only variation, which I highly recommend, is to add garlic, powdered or fresh.  It takes the flavor to a whole new level.  This tastes great served with Indian Naan (a flat bread).

Very good.  I often substitute different veggies for some the ones listed in the recipe.  I've made with & without the vinegar and very good both ways.  I've used fresh and dried herbs. For those that have written negative reviews when using dried herbs, please keep in mind 1 TBS fresh = 1 tsp dried.

I found that 35-40 minutes at 475 degrees was way too long. Instead, I cooked it at 475 for 30 minutes then turned the oven down to 350 for 5 minutes, then turned it to just keeping it warm (150 degrees) and the vegetables were still tender and flavorful.

Made this for Christmas dinner and even those who are not wild about squash and sweet potatoes loved it!  I substituted red potatoes for Yukon Gold, added some baby carrots, zucchini and a couple of whole garlic cloves.  I will definitely make this again.  It was a nice complement to the garlic prime rib.

I didn't like this recipe very much.  But then again, I made some modifications to it by using dried rosemary and thyme.  That was a big mistake, unless you like eating something that would resemble eating twigs (the rosemary).  The vegetables turned out really dry but that might be because I had to bake it for about an hour in order for the vegetables to be done.  I baked mine in a big pot and I think that it would have baked better/quicker in a 9x13 pan.  I would try the recipe again using fresh herbs, more olive oil and a 9x13 pan but I found it to be way too much work peeling and cutting up all those vegetables (specially the squash).

Great recipe,  I also omitted squash, and used baby carrots.  Sometimes I add parsnip slices, but the most colorful change I make is to use multi-color fingerling pototoes, quartered lengthwise. So pretty.  I also add brussel sprouts sometimes. So yummy!( When I know I will be short on time, I prepare the veggies, and soak them in a lg zip lock bag covered with water, kept in fridge, drain just before making the recipe.)

This was excellent! I am always searching for a good, healthy side and this fit the bill.  I did not use fresh herbs, just the amount and used dried.  I also added a couple of other veggies and some sun dried tomato dressing.  I cooked the potatoes and carrots for the first 1/2 of the cooking time and then added the remainder of the veggies for the last 1/2.  Great!!

Ever since I made this recipe, my husband requests it weekly! The leftovers taste just as good the next day, too! I typically substitue carrots for the squash and sometimes leave out the pepper, but I other than that I make it exactly as described! (By the way, I have made this with both fresh and dried herbs and DEFINITELY can tell the difference... try to use fresh if you can!)

This was wonderful. I wasn't sure about how to use the squash in it, so I cooked a small squash in the micro wave first for 8 minutes. It came out hot but not fully cooked yet. I cut it in half and scraped out the seeds and peeled it and then cut it up in large chunks plus I also added carrots, russet potatoes and a red onion. It turned out great. You could put any veggie in here and it would be wonderful. My family loved it. This is a keeper.

I made this exactly to the recipe (with the exception of acorn squash) and it was delicious.  Lots of chopping, but easy, and a great way to have a vege dish.  Needs lots of stirring, and maybe the onions and peppers could be added 10 minutes later than potatoes, squash and yams to keep them firmer.  Well worth a try!

This was absolutely delicious! It is a wonderful recipe in that you can easily adapt to fit what veggies are in season and what is in your fridge. I really appreciated the alternative suggestions included with the recipe and did use lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar since I didn't have any.  So many recipes are given 5 stars when they are criticized and changed so much by reviewers that you can't recognize the original submission.  This is NOT one of those. IMO this is a true 5 star exactly as written. Thank you, Saundra!

Excellent side dish.  A little honey also enhances the sweetness of the roasted veggies.  This is a great way to prepare spring and summer veggies too! (asparagus, tomato, zucchini, yellow squash).  I like to serve this with chicken breasts marinated and baked in extra sauce for an easy meal.

YUM!  Made this for a family dinner.  I added white mushrooms, fennel, and cherry tomatoes to the listed veggies.  The family freaked!  Note:  you can use dried herbs.  1 t. dried = 1 T. fresh.

This is a great side dish!  I used dried Thyme and Rosemary which added great flavor, however I will use fresh Rosemary next time I make it because the dried Rosemary texture doesn't work with the roasted veggies.  I followed another reviewer's advice to separate out the zucchini and bell peppers, adding about 20 minutes before it was finished.  I also marinated all the veggies for about an hour before roasting, made for excellent flavor!

Excellent dish!  I used sweet onions (instead of red-I don't like the texture of roasted red onions) and a yam (instead of a sweet potato, which gave more color and sweetness).  I cut all of my vegetables real big and chunky which made for a beautiful presentation, but did increase the cook time by about ten minutes. I cooked the root vegetables for 35 to 40 min. then put the peppers and onions in for the last 15 minutes of cook time, which another reviewer suggested. It really did make a difference and kept the peppers and onions bright and crisp. I made these for myself to eat over a few days, and they just got better as they sat in the fridge. Definitely give this one a try.
5 stars in my book.

Very good!  I cut back on the Rosemary & Thyme and glad I did.  This is a beautiful dish & went over very well! Made this for company & used 1 large butternut squash, 1 large sweet potato, 6 Yukon Golds, 1 red onion, 2 red bell peppers & 2 orange.  Covered the squash, sweet potato, Yukons with foil & baked for 30 minutes then added the rest & did 15 min covered and 15 uncovered.

I like adding fresh mushrooms.  Amounts and types of veggies can vary with excellent results.  I start with root veggies for 15 minutes, and then mix in the rest of the veggies for the remaining 20 minutes.  Puree leftovers or leave chunky with some stock and water for a very satisfying soup, especially when paired with fresh cornbread.

I've been craving roasted vegetables and although it's not a 30 minute meal - it was fantastic !  I have to say, I didn't have all of the ingredients (omitting the bell peppers, Yukon potatoes or fresh rosemary, but I did have the rest (and added portabello mushrooms, garlic cloves, shallots & some white onion as well as the red).  I also added a little of my homemade (dry) Adobo seasoning & dry Italian seasoning.  Loved it & loved the way the house smelled while it was cooking !  Wish I can eat it every day as a side dish to any meat or fish.  Yum !

One hint would be to cut the sweet potato in smaller cubes than the Yukon Golds since they typically need a little more time oto roast. The smaller size allowed them to have a nice consistency with the rest of the veggies. Absolutely loved the oil/vinegar/FRESH herb dressing. I added zucchini, baby carrots, a few cloves of fresh garlic because I had them on hand.

Oh, yum! Great recipe. If you don't have an herb garden, or your grocery budget is tight, dried herbs are just fine. Just remember - use 1 tsp. dried herbs for 1 Tbsp. fresh herbs.

This is fabulous! My entire family adores it (even my pug!). I've served it at dinner parties and for my family, and it is always colorful, delicious, and makes the whole house smell wonderful while it's cooking. I use sweet potatoes, carrots, red potatoes, and red/orange/yellow peppers, and it always turns out fantastic. I don't recommend using asparagus, green beans or broccoli, though..they make the whole dish taste bitter.

This was an excellent recipe. The vegetables are vibrant in color and very flavorful. I will be using this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. I substituted the sweet potatoes for broccoli and carrots. I also recommend chopping the vegetables up in different shapes for an added touch.

I was a little sad to see that the first review had such a low review.  I used dried thyme and rosemary both and I thought it was great!  I just adjusted because dried is much more intense and concentrated.  About a 3 - 1 ratio, so maybe the helpfulness of the review was to remind folks to adjust down when you used dried?  At any rate, I only used butternut squash, onions, and peppers but this was a very nice side to go with our salmon patties.  Thanks for sharing!

I served this at an annual Christmas Dinner for a ministerial association and it was a hit!  Since I was making it in a large quantity (every pan served 25 people), I decided to bake it @ 425 degrees to not get those black ends on the veggies when the temperature is too high.  It took 2 hours and the root veggies were still not perfectly done.  I ended up microwaving them for 5 minutes to soften the potatoes...it worked!  I must say that this is the best way to cook veggies for a crowd and still maintain your reputation as a great chef...there was not a potato or veggie left in the pans.  I did roast the root veggies for about an hour before I added the peppers, etc.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm still always amazed when someone does not follow the directions and gives a bad rating.  Just amazes me - I wish I could rate them........anyways don't mind me on my bandwagon.  These are Awesome!!!!!!!! So much flavor when you roast vegetables - hard to go wrong.  The fresh herbs are a must and the balsamic just sends this over the top.

With the suggested modifications this is so flavorful and hearty.  I upped the balsamic vinegar, added garlic cloves, and lowered the rosemary and thyme amounts.  Delish!

Wow Oh Wow, this was to die for. I realize that is not particularly good English, but this was an awesome recipe. I did not have fresh thyme or rosemary, but used dried ( about 1/2 what was required) and we WILL be making this on a regular basis. Healty, tasty, and really easy. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family! I followedthe ingredients as noted except I used a white onion instead of a red one and 1 yellow pepper and 1 red pepper instead of both being red.  Everyone wanted seconds!!!! I will make this over and over again.

I made this for Mother's Day and my whole family loved it! I didn't use Balsamic Vinegar because I didn't have any but it was still great. Even the kids went back for seconds and they usually turn up their nose at veggies. The flavor mixture was delicious. Thank you for sharing!

At first glance this recipe didn't look spectacular and I was pleasantly surprised at how fabulous it is. The balsamic vinegar creates a wonderful glaze when baked at this temperature. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone in my household thoroughly enjoyed it! Very easy and surprisingly delicious!

Followed another reviewer's suggestion to throw in the root veggies (potatoes & sweet potatoes) first, then others (I used zucchini, red bell pepper, and mushrooms). Also, didn't have an fresh herbs and oregano happened to be sitting out so I added that. Yummy and easy!

YUM! A wonderful hearty side for the winter! The recipe did make a LOT of veggies. I cut up all the vegetables and only roasted 1/2 first. I waved the rest and froze them. I roasted the rest of the veggies later. This worked out well. Freezing the potatoes and squash worked well and you simply have to add in fresh onion and red pepper out of the freezer. This way you don't have to worry about what you are going to use 1/2 a butternut squash for. Excellent flavor and good texture. NOTE: If you cook only 1/2 the vegetable, you only need to cook them for about 25-30 minutes.

This was really good. Instead of Yukon Gold, I used a mix of small red, blue and gold potatoes that I bought in a bundle at my local Trader Joe's.  This made the dish even more colorful and flavorful. I also substituted a banana squash for a butternut, due to availability. Love the balsamic - it adds a great flavor. Thanks for this recipe.

Very versatile and easy to make.  Have read complaints about using dried herbs but have found that you just have to adjust and use less than you would use if using fresh and it tastes great.

Last night I made this with some steak and it was great.  I didn't use some of the vegetables (not a fan of them), but I did use the herbs and vinegar as stated.  Also I added fresh garlic.  I used red, yellow, orange pepper, fresh broccoli, yellow squash, zucchini, and red potatoes.  I put the potatoes in the oven 20 minutes prior to the other vegetables.  Then I mixed in the other vegetables and cooked it about 20-25 minutes more.
It came out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

It is the perfect time of year for roasted winter vegetables!  To entertain two of our friends, my husband grilled a leg of lamb while I prepared a salad and these vegetables.  The nice thing with this side dish is it includes both the veggies and the starch.  Next time, I will add more balsamic, because it is one of our favorite flavors.  It only took my vegetables about 30 minutes at 475 degrees - - because I cut them all about 1 inch in size.  Make sure you stir every 10 minutes because they will stick otherwise.  Our guests were eating these straight out of the roasting pan while we carved the lamb!!

This is a fabulous recipe!   
I also mixed in a little Emeril's Italian Essence and Lawry's Seasoned Salt and Pepper  with the EVOO and balsamic vinegar. I took LDITTY's advice, baking the  red onion and sweet and yukon gold   potatoes for 30 min. first, then adding the red pepper (just one) a zucchini, yellow squash and a couple minced cloves of garlic, along with the fresh rosemary and basil. Did not use any thyme (I forgot to add it, but I would add a pinch of powdered to the oil and vinegar next time). We loved this, and here's another one I will be adding to the family cookbook! Thank you, Saundra.

This was SO good and so beautiful to look at with all of the colors represented in it!  I couldn't get butternut squash or Yukons, so upped the amount of sweet potato and used red potatoes; added broccoli (wonderfully absorbed the flavors of the herbs & balsamic vinegar); used fresh thyme & rosemary from our garden.  I forgot the garlic altogether (which is highly unusual!), but it still tasted DIVINE!  I used a jellyroll pan and covered it in foil (HIGHLY recommend for easy cleanup; otherwise I think you'll be sorry), and turned the veggies every 10 minutes 'til done.  We both LOVED it and will definitely be making this a regular part of our veg intake!  Next time, I'll increase the red onion because we love it.

Excellent dish!  Not a thing left after feeding 6 people.  Kids picked out their "dislikes" but adults absolutely loved every last morsel!  I did use summer and zucchini squash instead of butternut and cut into chunks rather than dicing.  I also sprayed the bottom of my roasting pan with oil cooking spray (PAM).  After reading reviews I cooked potatoes first for 20 mins and then when I went to add other veggies found that potatoes were already cooked thru.  So I added other veggies and cooked for 10 more mins and then turned off oven and let veggies sit til rest of dinner was ready.  Absolutely delicious!  Oh & I used the basalmic vinegar and might add a little bit more basalmic next time.  Thanks Saundra!

My husband loved it and he doesn't normally like squash.  I used zucchini, summer squash (I don't know what it's called), red onions, red potatoes.  I used dried herbs and it was delicious.  I can't wait to try it next time with fresh herbs.

These are delicious.  I love using the fresh herbs.  With the high heat I do watch them pretty closely after 20-25 minutes - I cut all the vegetables into bite sized pieces and they cook a little faster.  My kids are not big fans of the butternut squash in this so I sometimes leave it out.

Loved it!  The squash and sweet potato really gave this veggie dish an "ummph".  Perfect for fall and winter months.  Please note that you need to peel the butternut squash before cubing it.

Good flavor and is nice and soft. Added tomatoes, baby carrots, and zucchini in the last 20-10 mins. Next time I'll add broccoli.

Before I knew about this recipe, I was always finding forgotten bits of broccoli, or half bags of baby carrots in the veg drawer and throwing them out.  Not any more!  This is a great recipe to throw together when you have veggie odds and ends and I love how you can make it a day ahead and reheat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of my absolute favorite dishes. I make it frequently and my kids love it. So does anyone else I have served it too. Prep time can take awhile but it's so worth it. I add some variations on occasion. I will use Kraft Olive Oil Balsamic Vinagrette dressing and it makes the dish taste even better.

Could have used a little more by way of seasoning, but it was really good1 I roasted some garlic cloves in the pan with the veggies and it added a little bit more dimension.  All in all a pretty good recipe, especially for one who hasn't ever tried roasted veggies before!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was easy to make and very delicious.  I've never liked some of the vegetables but when they were prepared this way they were so delicious.  I used the suggestion by another poster to let the seasonings sit for a few minutes to meld before adding them to the veggies.  Next time I would use less olive oil.

i love these roasted veggies and use whatever i like or have on hand--the balsamic vinegar, fresh rosemary and olive oil give it a lot of flavor--i use more vinegar since i like a little more kick!

I roast veggies all the time- it caramelizes which makes the flavors  more intense compared to cooking any other way. Try adding grape or cherry tomatoes (cut in half) with or without the balsamic -  The flavor they add is amazing.

not exactly how i wanted it to turn out b/c some veggies were getting over cooked and others were still super hard (like the Butter squash and potatoes).. so my mom said next time i should pre cook the veggies that will take longer in the microwave before hand

I will continue to use this recipe.  I made a few modifications according to the reviews I read.  I used fresh juice from a lemon instead of the vinegar.  And the softer vegetables I added toward the last 20 minutes of cooking.  It pays to read the reviews. I didn't have the fresh herbs so I just seasoned with the dried herbs I had already.  This is a good dish.

Easy and tastes amazing!  For those people who live near Trader Joe's you can get cubed butternut squash there and avoid chopping up whole squash.

AMAZING! What flavor. I took this to a potluck and it was a big hit. This recipe makes 12 servings! MMM. It did take a LOT longer to cook than the recipe stated. After 45 minutes i finally dumped it out of the bowl and onto a cooking sheet and cranked the heat up -- it still took more than an hour to be completely done. Very, very yummy.

Very good. I will make often. I used garnet yams, red potatoes, red onion, asparagus, red pepper, beets and summer squash. I added mushrooms 1/2 way through. EXCELLENT! This is also good served with pasta - add pesto and a bit more vinegar and top with chopped walnuts and parmesian cheese. Next time I will use less oil. It did not look like too much oil before it cooked - and was quite oily when done. Using a convection oven did not save time.

Great recipe.  I used zucchini instead of the butternut squash and added mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.  The key is to stagger the adding of the vegetables because all the different veggies have different cooking times.  I did it in this order: Potatoes, peppers and onion, mushrooms, then tomatoes last.  It turned out perfect and the sauce added just the right kick.

It was delicious when we made it and ate it and even more delicious as left overs.  I don't think you need the yukon gold potatoes, I found it to be fine without it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  I tried to reduce the amount of veggies in half but found you should still use the same amount of seasonings and oil.  Added green pepper and more red onion.

I gave the potatoes a decent cook in a skillet to ensure they cooked through in the oven while I chopped up the rest of the veggies.  I simply put everything onto a sheet pan lined with foil, drizzled the oil, vinegar and herbs on top, mixed well with clean hands and popped it into the oven. I kept an eye on it and gave it a stir about 20 minutes into the cooking time and just watched it from there, making sure it didn't burn. Used those little yellow & green zucchini/squash thingies, red onion, four smaller Yukon gold potatoes and one package of precut butternut squash. I didn't have fresh herbs and didn't feel like buying fresh so just used herbes de provence, salt and fresh ground black pepper. Easy and amazingly delicious ~ it was our main course. Will definitely be making again, with mushrooms added.

I have been making veggies this way for a long time.
As far as the fresh verses dried herbs/spices l use only salt and pepper to taste, As we live to far from a town to run for fresh spices/herbs l have learned to work with what is handy. also mixing up different combinations as they become available is always fun to try even Brussel Sprouts are lovely done this way with the other veggies....... just remember not to use too many veggies that do tend to have an overpowering taste with another! mix and match and enjoy.

I do variations often and always seems to turn out well. If you have trouble getting carrots or potatoes done at the same time as the other ingredients--just pre-cook a couple of minutes or so beforehand in the microwave. Test with a fork to see if they are a slightly cooked, then add them to the rest to go in the oven.

I have been using this recipe for years.  I use it as a base for whatever vegetables I am roasting.  If you don't have potatoes, you can cut down the cooking time.  Note that I usually use dried herbs.  The reviewer who said that it does not work with dried herbs must have been doing a one-for-one substitution.  If you substitute 1 teaspoon dried for a tablespoon fresh it works fine.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I used carrots, beets (in a mini loaf pan to prevent staining), baby golds, sweet onion, and after 20 min, added halved brussels sprouts and turnips. I also left my fresh herbs in the oil (sealed) overnight. Thank you!

This was a great recipe. I sauteed the root veggies with a TBS of minced garlic and olive oil before baking them. I also did a green pepper, orange pepper and mushrooms, which really added some color and flavor. Also, if you don't have fresh herbs, I suggest using smaller portions of the dry  thyme and rosemary.

Very easy recipe and easy to tailor to the vegetables on hand. The dressing is great and seems to work with any root crops. I took the advise of other reviews and cut the potatoes small and left the squash bigger that would cook faster.

What a delicious way to cook vegetables!  I had quite a variety of veggies leftover from different things that I wanted to use up, so I did.  I had baby carrots, summer squash, red onion, red pepper, cauliflower, broccoli and sweet potato.  It only took about 20 minutes at 450 degrees for the vegetables to be done to our liking.

I have substituted a variety of other squash for the butternut squash, and we love it.

Multiplied this recipe by 9 and had NO leftovers!  I used 4 butternut squash, intending to add carrots too.  (voted out by the other church dinner cook)  Followed the recipe x 9 for the rest, except much less oil -- added that by eye.  Found beautiful small Yukons I could just halve.  Completely forgot salt & pepper (hectic kitchen)  Served 65 meals then the kitchen staff of 10-12 teenagers polished off the rest!!  Wonderful recipe; great for cut ahead - cook when needed.  Thanks, Saundra.

Just me and hubby so I scaled this down to 4 servings.  Made as written, but eliminated the sweet potato & added zucchini, brussel sprouts cut in half, cauliflower bites, and whole mushrooms.  I took other reviewers suggestion & zapped the Yukon Gold potatoes in micro & cut into larger cubes.  Also as others suggested, lined baking sheet with parchment paper.  Baked at 450 degrees 15 minutes, stirred, added the mushrooms, then baked an additional 15 minutes.  The veggies were all roasted evenly browned and Delicious.  I made a BIG mistake and kept them warm in oven until my other dinner dish was ready.  The veggies 'dried' out, but still very tasty.  The following day I chopped the leftovers, and made a Spanish 'tortilla' for brunch.  A Spanish tortilla is made with potatoes, onions, and eggs, so this worked out well and just as tasty, but more nutritious.  Warning:  DO NOT allow to sit in a warm oven.  See photo which was taken prior to putting dish back in warm oven.  Enjoy ASAP, or re-warm later.  Will definitely be making this again.

To the reviewer who had problems using dried herbs, dried are generally stronger than fresh so you will benefit from using less than called for when using dried. Otherwise...This recipe looks delicious!! We will definitely be trying it soon.

OMG...I just made this (I literally took it out of the oven a couple of minutes ago) and I can't stop 'tasting' it.  The herb/balsamic/olive oil mix enhances the sweetness of the vegetables.  It is absolutely delicious.  I pretty much followed the directions exactly although I used lemon thyme rather than regular thyme, because that was what was fresh at the market today and I thought that fresh was better than dried.  I hope I leave enough for dinner tonight...

I think I have died and gone to heaven!  What an excellent choice of seasonings and the balsamic vienegar was an incredible addition.  I did use white balsamic to avoid discoloring the vegies, which has so much color to offer.  I used one whole head of garlic, (next time I will used two)peeled and scattered, grape tomatoes and fresh asparaus at the end.  I cannot wait to make this for friends and family and have them experience what outstanding flavours these vegetables have.  Thank you so very much!

I used 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning in place of the thyme and rosemary.  Turned out delicious.  I will definitely use the recipe again.

A+recipe-TY! 2nd time around you can change it up and add more vegetables that are your favorites.  Butternut squash is fabulous in this dish.  My potatos were not Yukon and took more time.  I added fresh carrots and we loved the carmelized onion so used two.  Used a large roasting pan and dish was not quite done- turned the heat down and covered for about 30 more minutes.  A wonderful addition to my favorites.

I loved the recipe, but a bit bland for my taste. I also thought there was a bit too much oil for me. I ended up adding more balsamic vinegar and it turned out fine. Next time I'll half the olive oil, double the balsamic vinegar and add more herbs to it. Also, 45 minutes weren't enough, it took around 1h20 min to cook the potatoes, even though I'd cut them into smaller bits than the other veggies... Overall, I liked this a lot, and will definitely be making this again with my adjustments :-)

As a kick off to trying to eat better I thought I'd like to add more veggies to my diet. Never made roasted veggies. This was a great first attempt. I'm sure there's nothing to it but I'm glad I found this recipe. The smell was great even before going into the oven! I used a large butternut squash(never had before- only as creamed soup), tri-colored bell peppers, red potatoes, baby carrots and red onion. I would've used my sweet potato but was running out of room. I didn't have fresh rosemary and only dried thyme- so I just used 1 Tblsp italian seasoning(which contains morjoram, basil, thyme, oregano and rosemary). I will definitely make this again and again. Also I did use a little less than the called for 1/4 cup of oil. Per other reviews I used two pans, putting the squash  and potatoes on one and everything else on pan #2, I took pan #2 out after 30 mins and pan one out after 50ish. My daughters and I picked at this all day will actually make along side something next time-as this was a test run. Yum!!!

LOVE this recipe. It's versatile-- I have added and omitted different veggies, but I also use the squash and onions. You can use dried herbs, but use much less if using dried. I've also tossed in whole garlic cloves and other herbs (basic, oregano).

Haven't tried this yet but looks and sounds amazing. Just responding to previous comments complaints of the potatoes not being done while the veggies get overdone/mushy. I recently read a tip that sounds like it might work well for this situation. Before mixing all the veggies up, microwave your potatoes whole for just 2-3 minutes a piece in the microwave. This might help balance out the time differences and let the taters get crispy faster along with the veg.

These vegetables are fantastic. I used yukon gold potatoes, a giant red onion, an orange bell pepper, portabello chunks, and acorn squash chunks. I minced 3 cloves of garlic as well. I LOVE garlic! The balsamic vinegar did something amazing to these veggies. We served them along with a delicious rib-eye steak!

This was an outstanding winter veggie recipe.  I did not use the bell pepper. I did use fresh thyme and dried rosemary (don't forget it is only half the recipe for a dried spice).  This would be a great side for ham or turkey.  It's a keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A great side dish!  Easy to make too.  I used summer squash and baby carrots instead of the butternut.  I put the carrots and the potatos in for 10-15 minutes before everything else.  I made it the night before and just heated it up in the oven along with the main dish.

Saundra...this recipe for roasted vegetables is awesome!!!  It was very easy to make and absolutely delicious.  The combination of the sweetness of the red peppers and the squash, potatoes, etc. just makes a wonderful taste sensation in your mouth.  Plus, it's low fat too.  Thank you so much.

Easy and absolutely delicious--and this coming from a person who normally doesn't eat vegetables.  I did even more substitutions by using Italian & yellow squash instead of butternut.  This is definitely one of the yummiest ways to eat veggies.

Wonderful. I didn't have sweet potatoes but just went with what I had. I used another type of squash too. Just remember to cut vegetables according to length of time needed to cook. I am sure fresh herbs are the best but I had to use dried rosemary and chopped it up more and used about 1/2. My husband liked it a lot too. Will make again.

A little labor intensive, but worth all the chopping. The most difficult part was peeling the squash. I cut it into quarters, stood it on end and used my sharpest knife and cut straight down the outside to peel. I roast at 450, tenting if necessary. Just use common sense with the cooking times for the vegetables you are cooking. I think the submitter has a great combination as is, but I see where we all like to add our favorites. With dried spices, remember to use 1/3 the amount, for the amount of fresh. Next time I will use less potatoes & more sweet potatoes, (personal preference) I made again adding summer squash, mixing in at the very end. I love all vegetables but didn't care for zucchini in it. Even cooking for a very few minutes I found it to be too mushy for me.

Any combo of veggies works roasted in the oven; asparagus, sweet potatoes, fingerlings or baby reds, brussel sprouts. Since is dislike most herbs, I flavor with just salt & pepper & the olive oil. Roast in the upper third of the oven for crispier veggies

This recipe is AWESOME and can be used with dried spices if you know how to scale down for dried spices.

Pro Tip -- if you're going to use dried/processed spices, remember that you're only supposed to use 1/4 of the amount. Packaged & dried spices are stronger than fresh.

A great new side for just about anything, the whole family loved it. I used what I had, veggies were red peppers, baby bella mushrooms, zucchini and yellow squash and red potatoes (cut small). Used dried thyme and fresh rosemary. I put spices, vinegar and oil in a ziploc and shook it, then placed potatoes on one baking sheet and other veggies on another. Sprinkled all with sea salt and black pepper. Cooked potatoes for 40 minutes and other veggies for 20 minutes. Simple and delicious, easily adaptable to what is in season. Thanks, in the regular rotation now!

I have fallen in love with roasted vegetables.  I had some at a friend's house that were so good I decided to make some myself.  I used this recipe, omitting the thyme as I had none.  I varied the vegetables.  They were incredible.  I have made them on several occasions and always receive compliments.  Like others, I too, roast root vegetables longer than the other vegetables. Try it.  You will like it!

Awesome and works perfectly fine with dried herbs.  To the reviewer who gave it a bad review because s/he must have used WAY too much dried herbs: keep in mind that fresh herbs have water in them, making them larger and less strong.  Hence you always need MORE fresh herbs and LESS dried herbs.  A teaspoon or less (to taste) in this recipe would be fine.  That's what I did and it turned out delicious!

Well, I didn't have fresh herbs and i used the dried in lesser quantity and I thought this was excellent! I only used onions and lots of orange and red peppers and it was great! I served it with pearl couscous and some leftover chicken....throw in any and all veggies you have on hand...sugar snaps, carrots, garlic, asparagus...yummy! I will definitely save this one and make again!

Nom-Nom.  Easy to make and you can switch out other root vegetables if needed.  Threw in some broccoli that needed to be used up.  The only caution:  This takes longer than 35-40 minutes - probably closer to 1 hour (even with convection).  Makes a lot, it is good for you and the fam loved it!  So, will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

OMG! This is to die for. I opened up my fridge and found the following: sweet onions, red pepper, zucchini, red potatoes broccoli and carrots.  I followed all the other directions except for subbing dried rosemary (I had fresh thyme). My 16 year old daughter who eats only a few veggies ate this and loved it. It's so healthy too and really brings out the sweetness in all the veggies. Thank you so much for this divine recipe! I will make this again and again etc.... This is definitely a keeper. Great for guests and for everyday!

This was great (and healthier) with a few changes I made.   I used 3 russet potatoes, a yellow onion, 3 carrots and only one Tbsp. olive oil and 1/2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar with the fresh herbs.   Half-way through cooking I added one large eggplant cubed, 2 zucchini, 1 red peppers and 2 green peppers with another 1 Tbsp. olive oil and 1/2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar.   This uses 2 Tbsp oil vs. 1/4 cup as recommended in the original recipe and it was fine.

Delicious!!! Super yummy. :) I never really follow recipes to a tee, and most of the time just eyeball the measurements. Worked great here. End result: fingerling potatoes and butternut squash coated in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, Rosemary, thyme. I cook for one, so I'll be looking forward to this for dinner for the next few days!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.

The first time I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out delicious.

I have later amended it so I'm not putting in so many carbs. I've added cauliflower, tomatoes and usually leave one kind of starch (potato) and leave in the onions and peppers. MmmMmm good!

Beautiful recipe.  I made it with fresh herbs as well as dried, and the fresh is tastier, I will admit.  The balsamic vinegar makes a big difference and I think sets it apart.

We use whatever veggies we have available in the house and leave out the thyme and rosemary but add salt, pepper, and garlic cloves in the mix.  Yummy!  Thanks.

This veggie dish is such a wonderful autumn/holiday side dish.  Not only does it taste delish, but it looks so festive.  I made it for Thanksgiving last year and have made it many times since.  It has been requested for our holiday dinner tomorrow!

I've never roasted veggies and decided to try this.  Wow.  I used turnips (which get almost sweet) carrots, red onion, sweet potato and butternut.  I added some to the stew I was making and turned it into a completely new dish.  My hubby loved it.  This will be a staple in my recipe collection.  Thanks Saundra.

Excellent! You definitely need to cook the potatoes longer than other vegetables.  I used zucchini, cremini mushrooms, and green beans instead of squash and sweet potatoes.  I added 4 cloves minced garlic, the juice of one lemon, hungarian paprika, and substituted 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar for 1 tablespoon ume plum vinegar.  I think one of the secrets to how delicious this tastes is the high temperature, which roasts the veggies nicely. I am going to bring this dish to pass at my next potluck!

Nice, a simple winter blend, definitely let the root vegetables get a 30 min head start of cooking on the onions and peppers...  Our Oven is new so we went with it 450.  Total cook time was a hour, and it was perfectly cooked.

Incredible.  I added a few more drizzles of EVOO during the roasting process, but this was so good.  I also added a few mushrooms, too.  Better the second day after marinating in that "dressing".  Next time I will chop and marinate 12 hours in the fridge before roasting.  Overall, AMAZING!!

I have made these several times-absolutely delicious. I am always looking for new veg recipes, and this is great. My favorite is the sweet potatoes. I always add extra!

All of the chopping was a lot of work but it was all worth it. Seconds and thirds were had when I served this! It was very hardy and the flavors complimented each other perfectly. Excellent vegetables Saundra!

I thought this was OK.  I did make a few changes, but only in that I added a few additional vegetables (broccoli, zuccini, and mushrooms) to what was already listed in the ingredients.  We liked the flavor of the potatoes and broccoli but didn't care for the flavor of the other vegetables.  If I make this again, it would be made with only potatoes and broccoli.  Although we love zuccini and squash (especially my 2 and 12 year olds) they really prefer it sauteed with a little garlic and olive oil.  Thanks for submitting though!  Always like to try a new take on things!

Yum!  I thought these vegetables were fabulous.  I cut my veggies up in 1/2 inch cubes to cook faster.  The onions I quartered.  Will make again.

I loved this recipe! I think they people who say you must use fresh herbs or you'll ruin it are wrong. I used dried herbs, only because I didn't have fresh herbs on hand. You just have to remember to scale back. One tbsp fresh herbs is usually equal to about one tsp dried, but I used just under one tsp thyme and about a half tsp rosemary. I thought it came out perfectly. Will definitely make this again. Super easy and super delicious.

I use this recipe all the time - with a million variations and my family always loves it. I put in whole garlic cloves which they all fish for at the table, I will do just baby potatoes, onion and garlic as a more simple side dish sometimes and I often make it at the last minute and don't have fresh herbs on hand and I've used the dry variety without issue (although fresh is always best.)

Thanks Saundra for an Excellent Dish!  The sweet potato makes this dish, It adds the right amount of sweetness (Don't skimp on the sweet potato).. I added carrots and broccoli.  The broccoli was awesome!!  What a superb dish that anyone can add stuff and take away and it still comes out rock solid.  I'd recommend doubling the batch so you can eat it throughout the week.  It's an extremely healthy way to go.

First of all, I don't understand the person that rated the recipe a 2 when they didn't use fresh herbs the way the recipe states?  I am giving this recipe 4 stars only because I've made it half a dozen times now and it needs adjustments.  I have it nailed down now.  It's 5 stars if you do the following: Oven temp 450 instead of 475. Put potatoes, onion and carrots on one sheet to cook about 45 minutes.  Add the peppers, squash and zucchini to another pan and cook the last 20 minutes of the baking time.  Note, those are the veggies I typically use.  But, as long as you put the more delicate veggies in at the later time, it should be perfect.  I also add chopped fresh garlic to the oil mixture.

I used all the ingredients called for in this recipe then I added my own touch.  After cutting and cubing all the vegetables, I mixed one envelope of Lipton Dry Onion Mix and then added the herbs, oil and balsamic vinegar.  Delicious and a hit in my household

Excellent dish, made changes to suit our taste. First cut the potatoes into qtrs and boiled for 10 mins before putting into dish, this gives a softer centre with crispy out.   Used fresh Rosemary & Time as the recipe calls for, but cut down amount.  Added crushed garlic to the dressing, also added a head of Garlic with tip cut of for roasting.   Added lots of mediteranian veges which were perfect.    Loved the dressing, used a thicker Balsamic syrup which is also a little sweeter.   As with any roast vege dish that has different types of veges they obvisouly will take different cooking times, unless cut to suit.  Beautiful

It's a great compliment for meaty dishes but lacking a little flavor.  I recommend adding 1-1 1/2 tbs of soy sauce to the mixture and let it marinade for 10-15 minutes before roasting it in the oven, you won't regret it!

This is a fantastic simple recipe! I'm not a fan of squash of any sort, so I substituted it for some chopped carrots. I also cooked the root veggies for 25 minutes before i added the other vegetables (but could have cooked them more) I also used dried thyme and rosemary (1/2 tablespoon and 1 tablespoon) and didn't find it overpowering. Also added some chopped garlic.  Next time I make this I'll cut back the amount of oil, cook the root vegetables longer before adding the other veggies and I think add some Portobello mushrooms.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  I followed it to a T, and everyone at my party raved.  It was a perfect combination of flavors.  I used fresh rosemary and thyme, and it was very tasty.  I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and put the potatoes and squash in for 30 minutes before adding the peppers and onions in for the last 10 minutes.  Everything turned out perfectly well done.  I think I'm going to be bringing this to Thanksgiving now!

This was amazing!  Instead of Squash I used 2 sliced & chopped carrots. I left out mushrooms, we don't like them.  I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar for the balsamic.   I added about 1/2 teaspoon each of Oregano & Basil. I also used dried herbs for Thyme & Rosemary, thats what I have and it came out phenomenal!  I added 1 can of sweat Peas and 1 can of Soy Beans, both drained and 1 can petite diced tomatoes.  I took other reviewers suggestions and cooked the root veggies for about 20 minutes first at the 475degree.   Then I added the 3 cans of veggies with the bell pepper and mixed it all up.   Lowered the heat to 425 and added canned veggies to root veggie pan and cooked for additional 20 minutes.  This should still make about 12 servings.   With my substitutions the total Calories per serving are now: 210.  7 grams of fat per serving, 30 carbs per serving, 7 fiber grams per serving and 10 protein per serving.  So healthy and nutritious and best of all, so delicious!  This is super easy to cut, chop, prepare and bake.  What a joy!  This is a hit!  Thank you for posting this yummy dish!

AH-Mazing!! I changed the recipe up, but these veggies hands down, are incredible.  I cut up potatoes (keep these separate because they take longer to cook), onions (keep these separate because they take the shortest time to cook), zucchini, and squash.  Added a mixture of lemon juice, lemon pepper seasoning, garlic, dried parsley, balsamic, and olive oil to the veggies.  Put in the potatoes alone first at 400degrees for 15minutes then added the zucchini and squash for the next 20 minutes and the onions for the last 20. 55 minutes total.   Shake pan every ten minutes and tell your mouth to be prepared for greatness!!  :)  This will be a staple in my house.  Thank you!!

This was absolutely delicious!  I left out the thyme because 4 yo doesn't like the taste; used the following veggies: whole garlic cloves, baby carrotts, baby portabella mushrooms, grape tomatoes, zucchini, summer squash, sweet potato, red onion, broccoli, and cauliflower.  I roasted everything but the squashes, mushrooms and tomatoes for a whole hour at 450, added those 4 the last half hour, everything came out perfect - even the very picky 4 yo old loved it!

I used red skinned potatoes, onions and peppers as that is all I had, with dried rosemary and thyme and it was very good. I don't believe you only have to have fresh herbs, the dried worked very well in this case. I will however try them with fresh to compare...Baked at 375 for about an hour as I was making some baked pork chops also. ***UPDATE*** 2/14/09 I made this also as the recipe states and added broccoli for recommended time (maybe a little longer) and they came out sorta crispy but it lent itself a unique taste to the mix, think I will add broccoli again, just not for so long...

I don't like squash, so I substituted mushrooms and Japanese eggplant, and it turned out great.  I precooked the cubed potatoes (covered in plastic wrap) in the microwave for 10 minutes prior to roasting.  The fresh herbs totally make this dish.  I thought about skipping the vinegar, because I'm not usually fond of it, but I'm very glad I didn't.  It combines with the olive oil and herbs to create a wonderful flavor.

This was very good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is I needed to season it alot more to help bring out the flavors more.  More salt and pepper when roasting is needed.  I did this out on our gas grill in a saute pan.  I would make this again.  You have to appreciate sweet potatoes and squash.  The oinon really added alot.

I thought this was really good.  I substituted carrot for squash, used half lemon juice half basalmic vinegar and turned the heat down to 425.I also lined the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil so it did not burn, turned out great!

Wonderful recipe!  If using dried herbs, use about 1/3 the amount called for.  I have made variations of this a few times now, with different mixtures of winter squashes, zucchini, whole cloves of garlic, shallots, leeks, baby carrots, parsnips, turnips, potatoes and sweet potatoes.  Delicious every time.  My oven seems to run a little hot, so I roast for 20 minutes at 475, then 20 minutes at 425, stirring after every 10 minutes.

Hall of Fame recipe!  How perfect for this time of year with all the root vegetables.  I improvised with the olive oil/balsamic ratio until I had the taste I wanted. I cooked the root veggies for 20 min before adding the onion/red pepper for the additional 20 mins. Using fresh herbs is key and I also recomend some red pepper flakes.

This recipe was a hit. Even my kid who doesn't like vegetables came back for more.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, but added a beet cubed somewhat smaller than the potatoes because it is more dense.  That beet added gorgeous color and flavor to the whole ensemble.  In addition I added a handful of peeled garlic, which cooked up to be nutty and mild. I would highly recommend this recipe and the addition of the beet(s)and garlic.

I was very excited to try this recipe given all of the great reviews but was sort of disappointed. Followed the recipe to a "t" and found it too have too much rosemary and thyme. Will use less next time.

wonderful side dish.  Full of flavor.
Make sure you cut potatoes in big chunks or they will be mushy.  Use fresh herbs don't substitute.

The smell alone will convince you!  I made this according to recipe, only adding garlic.  I layered these in my big roasting oven...and it wasn't even done and I was thinking, I didn't make enough - they are gonna want more!  I'm making this again and sealing it up for lunches for myself.  What a GREAT way to get your 5 servings in...and lose weight too!

Delicious but way too greasy.  I made it a second time and just sprayed the veggies with cooking spray and drizzled the vinegar on. Much better.

The best recipe I've ever found for roasted veggies.  I used squash, zucchini, red onion, sweet potato, mushrooms, and yukon golds.  I separated the root veggies from the softer ones, and roasted them about 20 min longer.  I made this for a dinner party of 20 people, and it could not have been easier.  Everyone raved about the balsamic glaze.

Yummy!! I made a roast in the crockpot and didn't want crockpot mushy vegetables.  These were so crisp and tasty.  I used Idaho potatoes, yams, yellow onion, green bell pepper, carrots and fresh garlic.  It turned out so delicious, my whole family went back for seconds!

I just love roasted vegetables, and this recipe didn't disappoint me.  Remember though, as with all recipes that call for fresh herbs, if you plan to used dried then halve the amount!  This can definitely be added to with all kinds of vegetables, but I really loved the butternut squash and sweet potatoes!  If you plan to add more delicate veggies, then I would cook the ingreds in this dish for 10 minutes alone before adding "softer" veggies.  Really, really good! It's a great winter side dish!

These are THE BEST mixed with pasta, extra olive oil and butter, lemon juice, and parmesan cheese.  Even better with grilled chicken.  One of our summer favorites.  Tastes like it came from a good italian restaraunt...

After using the recipe about 10 times now, I had to add my two cents.  This is both delicious and versatile.  I have added mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, and whole garlic cloves and this recipe never lets me down.  Thank you!

Delicious!  I made this tonight for a dinner party, and everyone loved it!  I added yellow squash, zucchini, and omitted the butternut squash. I doubled the sauce since it seemed like I had A LOT of veggies!  Will definately make again!  Thanks!
ETA:  I food processed the leftovers, and put it on a sandwich with goat cheese, and shredded chicken, it was soooo good!:o)

This was a pretty good recipe, although I didn't care for the rosemary/thyme flavor. I tried this again with only olive oil, seasoning salt, and garlic powder, and I also substituted yellow squash and zucchini for the butternut squash. It was much more suited to my tastes, so don't be afraid to experiment with the basics of this recipe!

Excellent way to use up vegetables in the fridge.  I added leeks, orange and yellow peppers, and celery.  To shorten the baking time I microwaved the vegetables and then roasted them until browned after they were softened by the microwave cooking.

Wonderful!  I like to use less Yukon golds and more sweet potatoes.  I also add whole mushrooms.  Leftovers make fabulous burritos, served with Mexican 4 cheese blend, sour cream and tomatillo salsa.  Delicious!

This was great.  After reading the other reviews I decided to omit the rosemary and thyme because I did not have the fresh herbs on had (only dried).  It was still delicious with just the oil, balsamic vinegar and salt & pepper.  My dinner guests really liked it.

These were very good.  Like others, I played around with a variety of vegetables.  No matter what you choose, I just don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.  The only other thing I changed was that I added clove of minced garlic to the vinagrette.  It tasted great and smelled wondeful.  I'll definitely make this again.

Love this recipe.  I used dried rosemary and fresh thyme and it was great.  I think you could cut down on the amount of oil by almost half.  Can't wait to try it with the lemon.  This is a great way to get your veggies in.  I could eat this as a main dish with nothing else!

This was just wonderful.  I served to company and they raved.  The colors are so pretty, too.  This is listed under Christmas recipes but I think it's a neat fall recipe too.  I gobbled up all the leftovers and can't wait to make it again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good universal vegetable recipe.  I use whatever vegetables I have on hand and it always turned out great. Except when I forget the basalmic vinegar..oops!  But even then it was still edible, but I definitely knew I had forgotten something.  Great recipie, thanks for posting it!

This is absolutely fabulous! Definitely a new favorite. 

**very important** If you can't find fresh herbs and have to use dried, you have to use 1/3 of the amount! So, the recipe calls for 2T fresh, you use 2t dried. 1T fresh=1t dried.  I suspect that's where the "overpowering" comments come from.

Cook the potatoes on one cookie sheet and the peppers, onions, and zucchini on another. The peppers etc. get done much faster (about 10 mins. They get overdone very easily). And cook the potatoes for about 20-30 mins. Spray the foil on the cookie sheets well. And stir veggies once or twice while cooking. Bake at 400 degrees. The balsamic mixture was good but not strong enough. I would do more of it on the veggies.

After reading the reviews and looking at my Indian slow cooker cook book - I made the following changes: I used 2 eggplant, 1 large potato, a chopped onion, 3 fresh tomatoes, and I made rather large matchsticks out of a big carrot.(I skipped the winter squash and bell pepper) I then took 1 Tablespoon of Garam Marasala, 1 Tablespoon of Cumin not seeds and a Tablespoon of sea salt with 6 Tablespoons of olive oil and heated it up over the stove top letting the heat bring out the favors. I then took the spice mix and poured it over the big bowl of prepared veggies and tossed well. When all the veggies are covered I covered the large bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in the fridge over night. The next day I dumped the whole thing in the crock pot for about 4 hours on high and added 2 cinnamon sticks.Do not add water! Because the crock pot cooks veggies differently it will not be mushy after 4 hours. Remove the cinnamon sticks and WOW! Out of this world good and spicey so your lips felt it but not too hot. Great basic recipe! Thanks for the ideas.

I am 17 years old and I made this for my family for the first time yesterday and I have to say it was delicious! Super easy to put together especially for someone who is new to cooking. Even my 10 year old sister really enjoyed this recipe. I also added zucchini to this recipe which was so delicious! We used this as a side dish for our baked salmon! Super yummers, definitely reccomend this recipe!

Absolutely our "go-to" side dish. We double it and use sweet potatoes instead of Yukon.  Love all the other veggies.  Great left overs. Even our 13 month old granddaughter loves the butternut squash and sweet potatoes.

This recipe is great because you can use just about any vegetable!  Sometimes I make it exactly to the recipe, but other times I will use what I have on hand -- zucchini, cucumbers, green peppers instead of red, cauliflower, and carrots have all turned out well. I like to stick a few cloves of garlic in as well.  But the rosemary and thyme compliment literally any combination of veggies.  It makes a great dinner paired with some couscous. :)

Wonderful recipe, and very versatile!  This is a great way to roast lots of different veggies.  Fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, and red peppers are a must.  I've made this many times.   I've used different kinds of winter squash, different kinds of potatoes (gold, red, white but not russet), added fennel bulb (delicious richness when roasted), added carrots (wonderful sweetness), added cherry tomatoes, subbed white for red onions, thrown a bit of garlic powder into the marinade.  Just a hint: remember that potatoes/squash will take the longest to cook per size; make sure they are all about the same size and larger chunks of onion and/or bell pepper are ok.  DELICIOUS!!!

I made this exactly as it was written and it was awesome!  I cooked it about 20 min longer because I like my vegetables very soft.  I will make this often.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a good roasted veg recipe. It needs a lot more seasonings though. I'll make it again with more salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, & olive oil etc. In all fairness I did decrease the serving portion from 12 to 4, but the computer seemed to decrease it proportionately. A splash of Bragg's Amino Acids makes it come alive. 
It's best to group appropriate veg together: Root vegetables – carrots, potatoes, yams, beets, parsnips, turnips, onions (yellow or red)
Mediterranean – peppers, eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, grape tomatoes, red onions, whole garlic cloves
Cabbage family – broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts

Asparagus and green beans

Made this for the first time for Christmas dinner. Substituted carrots for the squash due to some palettes really not agreeing with them, but it came out amazing! Everyone loved it and wanted to take seconds (and thirds) home. I will definitely be making this for fugure meals, especially holiday gatherings!

I liked this but that's way, way too much oil.  A little too much of the spices also.  Just my taste, I guess.  I want to taste the lovely squash and potatoes, not overwhelm them with that much spice.  Still, I liked it and will just adjust it to my taste next time.  I also lowered the temp to 400, as 450 seems a bit too hot.  Maybe next time I'll try 425.

Great recipe. Colorful and healthy. Not sure why people rate a recipe down because they don't follow it.  It just distorts the overall rating   The problem wasn't the herbs, but using too much thyme. Of course fresh herbs are better.

This is awesome! Super delicious! I used butternut squash, 1 sweet potato, 1 yam, 1 cauliflower, broccoli, brussels, and red peppers. I double the marinate and add 2tbsp of lemon juice. Next time I would add even more herbs and olive oil! Butternut squash, sweet potatoes, and Brussels turned out the most yummy. Make sure they are fully coated with marinade, and turn them every 10 min or so, otherwise they will burn. Enjoy!

This was so easy and good! I could not stop eating at it, even as I was putting the leftovers away. I added quit a bit of salt and pepper since many of the veggies in the dish don't have a lot of flavor on their own. Everything caramelized nicely and cooked at a similar pace. The red peppers and onions got a little crispy around the edges and the squash and potatoes were deliciously soft and sweet. Fave way to cook veggies in the fall/winter. The fresh herbs added a very nice touch. 5 stars!

I made this for the first time tonight as a main dish, since I am trying to eat only a plant based diet.  I used sweet potatoes, red onion, mini red yellow and orange peppers, cauliflower, zucchini and mexican squash.  I used grapeseed oil in place of olive oil, since I am not a fan of olive oil.  I prepped and cooked according to directions, the full 40 minutes (I had a large pan full of veggies)  They turned out perfect! Thank you for the recipe, this is one I am definitely going to use over and over again! Oh, I forgot to  mention, I served this over a serving of quinoa.  It made a complete perfect, meal.

I never thought skinning butternut squash would be so tedious! Otherwise, this recipe is a breeze. Ended up using 1/4 squash, 3 fist-sized potatoes and similar sized sweet potatoes. Made the mistake of using an average-sized onion instead of a large one. I cubed all the vegs into about 2cm blocks, so the onions ended up quite overcooked, but still tasty anyway. I used the 1/4 cup of olive oil and 2 tbsp of balsamic and the vegs were not too oily. The herbs gave everything a great earthy taste. Will definitely use again!! Brought it for a dinner party with rather discerning cooks, and they were pleased.. thankfully!

I have made this recipe several times now and it has turned out wonderful everytime! I have used many varieties of vegtables and have found that putting the root vegtables in first to cook for 20-30 minutes and then adding the others keeps them all at the same consistance, instead of some being perfect while others are mushy or some being perfect while others are undercooked. Over all this is a wonderful recipe and is very helpful when wanting to add more vegtables to your diet since you can make it so many ways and it is soooo easy to do!!

Excellent!  Use the convection bake option if you have one; keeps the vegetables firm, especially bell peppers.  Addition of goat cheese at the end is nice too.

Wonderful. I agree with some of the reviewers, toss in the onions, peppers a little later to keep their colour. I chose different vegetables, including celery, carrots, sweat peas and Jerusalem artichokes (so yummy!). Will redo this on a very regular basis--great to get the whole family to have a large portion of vegetables.

I could eat these vegetables everyday.  I added asparagus, zucchini, (salt and pepper) and used white balsamic vinegar.  The sweet potato and butternut squash were especially delicious.  I roasted 2 huge trays for about 2 hours.  Fabulous.  Wonderful.  Amazing.  There aren't enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe my love for this dish!

Excellent recipe. The sky is the limit with the type of veggies you can use. I didn't have any squash but had the rest and added carrots and this turned out great! Would use less Thyme as the flavour can be a bit strong. Thanks for posting this recipe

This was excellent and a huge hit at Christmas dinner! The only change I made was using a green pepper rather than red, since the red peppers at my store were terrible looking. I will absolutely make this over and over again! Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

I followed the directions and put in oven at 450.  Delicious!  Only had dried rosemary, still great!  This is so simple, I will make it over and over.

i did this last minute to go with dinner..made it in a skillet to start..then finished off in the microwave.  not with fresh herbs, so used far less..also added a few big squeezes of honey.didn't have raw potatoes, so added a chopped up can of white potatoes/not sweet potato either, so left that out. not bad

Quite tasty! Good flavor from the herbs. Mine got a little blackened while it cooked, so if that happens you could just spray some cooking spray on and mix it around. (I added extra olive oil, which worked but became too oily.) You could certainly change the veggies to taste.

I added beets and next time will also add carrots.  Be sure to stir/turn the vegetables every 12-15 minutes. May need to add a little more olive oil between stirrings to prevent  from sticking to pan.  This dish was awesome!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I made it with 3 kinds of potatoes, onions and beets (since that's what I had on hand), fresh thyme and dried rosemary.  Seriously, this was the best roasted veggie dish I've ever made.  Thank you for such a simple and outstanding recipe!

Made this recipe for a friends get-together last Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I learned after the first batch that you have to watch and take out before the vegetables become too dark or too dry.  I don't like the darkness of the balsamic so use the lemon juice instead with bright results.

Good and healthy.  I had trouble getting certain veggies since I live in Romania but I made some substitutions and it was still good.  I would second the person who said to cook the "root" veggies first though.  This was huge.

I made this tonight as a side dish and it was not good. I think the vegetables that I used were not to be roasted that long. I should have known, but we are not big potato eaters which would contribute to the length of time in the oven. Sorry, but won't try this again.

This was so, so bland. The squash was the worst, it had no taste at all. It took forever to peel & chop all those vegetables. My advice is to leave out the squash & marinate the rest of the vegetables for a few hours or even a day, before baking.

Fantastic flavor and easy to do.  Just cut the potatoes very small and it all got done within 45 minutes.  scrambled up some left-overs the next morning with egg and had a very tasty and filling breakfast.  Can't wait to make again.

My bf and I really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I omitted the fresh herbs because I didn't have them. I think this recipe tasted great that way and didn't miss the herbs at all. In fact I think the fresh herbs would have been too much. I will make this again.

Very good! Mine took more like 50-55 mins. to achieve a nice golden roasted look. Next time I will add a little maple syrup to the oil and vinegar.

Delicious!!! I followed the recipe but substituted dry thyme (1 tsp dry = 1 tbsp fresh). Added basil as one reader suggested as well as zuchini and summer squash, covered the root vegetables loosely with tin foil and cooked for about 30 minutes, stirring about every 10 min, then added remaining veggies for last 10-15 min. The root veggies were a bit mushy so next time I will probably cook uncovered.

This was awesome - I've been looking for something that I can combine carbs and veg so I don't have to spend much time cooking, and this was definitely it.  I did use different veg though, this was a great way to use up the stuff in your fridge that is on the verge of going bad.  I used carrots and regular potatoes, yellow onion - then the last 15 minutes of cooking, I threw in some zucchini and mushrooms, it was perfect!!

Delicious.  Took other readers' suggestions and added the peppers, tomatoes, and garlic with 20 min left.  Will make again and again.  The squash was fantastic.

My family loved this, 19 months, 7, 9, & Dad all wanted more.  Made enough for leftovers for lunch and had none!!  Will make over & over but don't limit yourself to recipe ingredients, I will used whatever is in my kitchen!!  We used all dried herbs but I used Johnny's Salad Elegance with Old Bay, dill, basil, whole garlic cloves and salt & pepper.

delicious! i also added pieces of pineapple and asparagus just because i had some handy.. it was really good! as some reviewers have recommended, i tried roasting mushier veggies apart from harder veggies, but i found that it`s not all that necessary. the second time i roasted them all together. great recipe! and super easy too.

Simple and tasty. I'm sure you could use any root vegetables you have on hand. I used potatoes and brussell sprouts and lemon juice instead of balsamic and it was great.

Have been making a version of this for years.  I always add garlic powder (at least 2 tsps.) and usually add fresh beets and turnips cut up.  It is a great recipe for veggies...

Let me just say that I could have eaten about five onions by myself using this recipe! I just used the "sauce" for the vegis I had on hand--baby reds, baby carrots, zuchinni and onion--and they turned out nicely except the zuchinni (for those thinking of trying it, even in large chunks, it was reeeeally mushy). I used all thyme because that is what I had fresh and the only downfall was wanting a smidge more flavor from the balsamic. I will definately try it again! I did salt again right after I removed it from the oven and it added some nice depth.

I used dried thyme and rosemary and it was totally overpowering. I didn't see the comment below until after. Even with the overpowering flavor the vegetables weren't very soft at all. Also, 475 degrees charred the vegetables slightly and set the fire alarm off multiple times.

I've been "playing" with this recipe for a few years.  No matter what vegetable combination, it always turns out fabulous.  Sometimes I've used sweet onion instead of red onion which adds a different, subtle flavor.  I've also used eggplant and an assortment of colored potatoes from Trader Joe's. If you are in a real hurry try using an "As Seen On TV" Vidalia Onion Slicer.  Everything ends up uniformly cut in small cubes.  This recipe is a great stepping stone for newer cooks.

I make this several times a year and it always turns out delicious. The key is the fresh herbs...don't substitute dried!! Also, cut the peppers into thick strips, don't chop or dice. You must stir it every 10 minutes so it doesn't burn!! It's worth the work!!

I make this often in the cooler seasons. If I don't, my husband will remind me! I like to serve it as a vegetarian main course on top of various grains (if you can find whole (not pearled/processed) barley, that's a great combination of flavors!).

It's hard to review "roasted vegetables" because roasting vegetables is always a favorite.  You can do anything you want with what you do and do not put in the recipe, and, assuming you're a veggie lover, it's going to be good. I personally made several changes to this recipe: omitted squash, added brocolli, substitued oregano and garlic powder for the listed spices.  I also sauteed onions/mushrooms in butter and garlic towards the end of the roasting, and pour that over the finished product. Regardless of whether you make these changes or not, this is a hearty vegetable dish that should be remembered for hearty dinners and parties. The only word of caution: cut the potatoes no bigger than 1/4 inch thick, and sized no bigger than a quarter so that they won't take forever to cook.

I've taken the basic gist of this recipe and other Roasted Veggie recipes on this site and made them according to my own specifications on several occasions. The basic premise of roasting vegetables is very simple which makes this recipe the ideal combination of -'flexible' & 'easy'.

There's no butternut squash in this part of the world and I'm not sure what Yukon Gold potatoes are...so my medley of veggies rotates between a combination of the following: regular potatoes (thinly sliced), sliced beetroot (semi-cooked in a pressure cooker beforehand, one whistle), carrots and baby corn sliced long, red & yellow bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, sliced mushrooms, zucchini, onions, green beans, broccoli, eggplant......really whatever you have in the veggie crisper works. 
All of this is drizzled with olive oil and for seasoning: crushed garlic (7-8 cloves sometimes!), a dash of organic rock salt, ground pepper, red chili flakes, fresh basil/thyme/oregano, a bay leaf, a squeeze of lemon or very little balsamic vinegar. 
Let the veggies sit for a while before roasting, makes it more flavorful-- I cook between 180 to 200 C (400F) on the convection setting on my microwave for about 15 minutes. Some people keep the root veggies for longer and then add the squishier veggies like tomatoes and eggplant in during the last 10 to 15 mins but I put everything in at once because I'm lazy. Overall, quite a winner and the slacker's way out of cooking dinner (esp. if you can get someone to do the

Wow.  I only made a half recipe and there was still a lot of food, but really delicious way to make these veggies.  It's the right combination of sweet (from the basalmic, squash, and sweet potatoes) and salt.  I added minced Garlic to the basalmic and olive oil.  I didn't have yukon golds yesterday but used russets.  The russets were the best flavor of them all and I'm not sure I'd want the sweeter softer yukons. Made sure to use fresh rosemary and thyme as well.  A Keeper.

Delicious!!!  I have long been a fan of roasting carrots or potatoes in the oven with just olive oil, salt, and pepper, but this combination of veggies with the vinaigrette is great.  I used baby carrots instead of squash (wanted to try squash but it looked bad at the market), and I made a large amount of the dressing, put in some minced garlic, and put the dressing with all the prepared veggies in a large resealable bag.  I let them marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours, but I think even longer would have been better.  I spread them out on a rimmed baking sheet, and cooked them for probably 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes as the recipe states.
We had this as a side dish to pork tenderloin, and I think it would be a fantastic side to ANY meat.  Also would be great for entertaining since you end up with a TON of veggies!
HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!

This dish turned out perfect! The only thing I didn't do was add the butternut squash and sweet potato. I felt it was too heavy for hot weather. Instead I used yellow crookneck squash from the garden and red potatoes instead of Yukon. Although either would give the same tasty results. Also, I used Garlic flavored Olive Oil instead of regular olive oil. I'm going to make this again later this week. Thank you Saundra!

I made this for our Christmas Eve dinner with a crown roast of pork.  Because the oven would be in use, I roasted these the night before (I took them out about 15 min. before the full cooking time was up) and reheated them after the roast came out of the oven.  Absolutely delicious!  I'd also love to post the crown roast recipe, but it was Emeril's from the Food Network.

This was so easy, and so delicious.  Be aware of the amount of oil though - too much and it can be greasy. We used sweet potatoes, red onion, and red pepper - perfect!! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times in the last six months and each time it's been fabulous.  You can use almost any veggies or tubers.  Summer squash work well.  If there's a worry about overcooking, the veggies can be cooked partway at a lower temperature.

What a disappointment! The white potatoes took so long to cook that the rest of the veggies came out mushy - it was bland too. I assumed since the other reviews were so great that this was a sure thing - I guess we should never "assume" anything!

This was AWESOME!  I found it when I was looking through vegetarian recipes for Thanksgiving.  We made enough for an army, but had NO leftovers.  Even the kids love them.  My vegetarians were in heaven!   Give yourself plenty of time for peeling and chopping the squash.  It's not easy, but is well worth the effort.

I love this because it is so versatile.  Use the recipe as a base and then add whatever you like or whatever you have on hand.  The possibilities are endless.  The herbs can be added, deleted and adjusted to your own personal liking.  I have made this many times in as many different ways.

Wonderful recipe!  You can vary the vegetables (i.e., for simplicity sake, use zucchini vs. butternut squash).  My company loved the addition/flavor of the sweet potatoes.

Fabulous!  I substituted carrots for the sweet potato.  Making it the day ahead is a huge plus and it tasted fine reheated.

I take this dish to a potluck event that I attend every year (going on 5 years now)and it is a huge hit. When making for a large crowd it is a little time consuming but the final product is well worth the effort!

Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Didn't have butternut squash so I used carrots.  This is so easy.  The hubby loved it too.  It is guaranteed to be a regular around here.  Thanks for putting this one online.

Good basic recipe.  I used the veggies I had on hand:  broccoli, cauliflower, sweet onion, fresh mushrooms, carrots, and zucchini.  I doubled the balsamic vinegar.  I did not have the fresh herbs on hand so I added dried Italian seasoning also added fresh garlic.  Be sure to cut your veggies in larger chunks so they don't burn.  It only took mine about 20 minutes.

I brought this to a lunch party and it was a hit! I think you could probably use any veggies and it would turn out super yummy. I used bell pepper, squash, carrots, onion, green beans, and cauliflower. And I used lemon juice instead of the vinegar. Very tasty!

Fantastic! I followed the suggestions of others, using Pam spray to prevent sticking and adding zuccini and summer squash. Fresh herbs are the secret. For those without any on hand remember that for both rosemary and thyme, 1 tsp of dried is equivalent to one tbsp fresh. This recipe was a huge hit. I don't eat any of the ingredients except for the potatoes and I loathe onions. But, the onion chunks are so big I could pick them out but still get the flavor. As for everything else, it was all wonderul. I fed 4 college guys with it and there was nothing left. Even I went for seconds. Give this one a try, you won't be sorry.

Well worth the time. I did use the advice of others and I pre-cooked the potatoes and carrotts (for I added carrots) for about 10 minutes before adding the other veggies. I added carrots, mushrooms and zucchini. I did use dry thyme and rosemary for I could not find fresh. I also lined my casserole dish with Reynolds Release non-stick foil, which worked out great for the veggies did not stick and it made for easy clean up.

This isn't one I'd repeat, it was a little bland. I found a simmilar recipe that I prefer which was a little more flavorful, with lots of fresh garlic and lemon zest, some cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives. But I suppose the beauty of roasted veggies is that you can change it however you'd like to suit your taste.

Very very good recipe. Altho I do think you should add carrots to the mix, as I did. They come out quite well. I believe the key to this is to get chunks of vegetables that are even in size, so they will cook through at the same rate. I did pre-cook the potato, sweet potato, and squash for about 20 minutes before hand. I added a bit more of the herb and oil concoction due to the increased ammount of veggies I added. Oh yes, and instead of red onion, try a big sweet onion. They really add something to the dish.

Wow, I have no idea what I did, but this recipe left a very bad after taste in my mouth, maybe the balsamic vinegar?
Maybe too much rosemary or Thyme.
I followed the recipe exact, and it just had a very strange taste.
I don't believe I'll be giving this a second chance.

This recipe has been a huge hit with everyone who tastes it! I usually serve this as a main dish with couscous -- just beefed up a little. I tend to use red skins instead of baking potatoes and will sometimes throw in some cherry tomatoes. And don't forget to add the mushrooms...LOTS of mushrooms (they're always the first to go).

Very good recipe.  I used the balsamic vinegar this time but will use the lemon juice the next time.  I also used red potatoes instead of the yukon.  I cut the zucchine too thin so it cooked faster than everything else.  Next time I will cut in larger chunks.  Followed other viewers and sprayed the dish with pam and stirred every 10 minutes. Store didn't have both fresh herbs so I used fresh rosemary and dried thyme.  Would definitely make again.

BAM!! These were awesome! I always ask for vegetables like this when out to dinner because I never tried them at home!  This tasted absolutely delicious! I actually used zucchini, red, yellow and green peppers and onion. I made this with my Easter dinner and there were no leftovers.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I don't think my rating registered so I am sending this again with my five stars and I give it an extra five stars!!!

I didn't have the veggies or herbs on hand that Saundra used but it came out wonderful anyway!  I used red, yellow, and orange peppers, and zucchini as the veggies, and fresh basil and cilantro.  I found the 475 degree oven too hot and turned it down to 450.  I think it would have been better if only roasted for 30 minutes.  I also baked some tofu topped with the same olive oil mixture and served over brown rice.  It was orgasmic.  My husband even raved!

Excellent recipe.  The fresh herbs, olive oil and lemon juice are very fragrant!  I played with the proportions a little, reversed the potato to sweet potato ratio.  I also added zuchinni and mushrooms.  It was a big hit with with my Christmas day crowd and helped to offset the too sweet sidedishes that can predominate.  Without the fresh herbs this dish would not be the same.

Oh this was sooo good! I made this once just as the recipe stated, but using dried herbs. The next time I used fresh herbs and it makes a lot of difference. Please use the fresh if you can find them. The second time I made this I added carrots and turnips to the mixture. I made this the night before Thanksgiving and reheated it covered in the oven for about 20 minutes on Thanksgiving Day. It was a perfect side dish.

This was okay, not great.  Neither of us is a big squash fan, but we thought this might make it easier to swallow.  It didn't.  If you like squash, you might like it.  Maybe reduce the vinegar a bit because it is pretty overpowering.

This dish is wonderful to have as a delicious healthy snack for lunch time, or to serve the family as a side dish with dinner. I used two gallon size zip lock bags to shake the fresh cut veggies in a low fat balsamic vinaigrette, lemon pepper, dried oregano, and a little extra olive oil. I added a few sliced carrots, two jalepenos, and a few cups of broccoli florets. Shaking the veggies in the sauce with those seasonings, and letting them soak for 30 minutes in that before baking,  turned out perfectly. The broccoli and carrots were an excellent addition if you have those on hand. My oven cooked this dish best at 425°F, stirring every 10 minutes, taking about 50 minutes to caramelize the onions and sweet potatoes. Hope this information helps! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is very straightforward, and the ingredients are quite easy to round up..... and wow, what a tasty side dish for any meat or poultry.  It makes a large portion, probably enough for 4 generous adult helpings, and is also great heated up as leftovers.  We added asparagus and mushrooms 15 minutes before it was done.
Give it a try, tasty, great colours and textures... a keeper recipe for sure!!

It is a great way to get the veggies in. It consist mainly of potatoes, but it was good. The onions really set this dish up to delicious with bursting flavors. It had a slight grilled taste. I made this recipe exactly the way it was called. It will be a Christmas dish this year.

This is the first time I have cooked with butternut squash, and I was very pleased.  I did read the other reviews, and made a few changes.  Since I don't use fresh herbs - I used dry - so I used a 1/2 tablespoon of thyme and rosemary.  Everything else remained the same.  I also cooked 25 minutes covered at 450 then 20minutes uncovered at 475.  My husband really enjoyed the dish. I will be making it again, next time I might some of the other variations based on the review.

Loved this dish! Used carrots, red potatoes, butternut squash, red onion, and brussel sprouts. Like another reviewer I put the carrots, potatoes, and squash in for 15 minutes first, then added the onion & sprouts and cooked for another 30 minutes or so. I used dried herbs cause that's what I had, but fresh would have been even better

I can't say that I followed the recipe to the "T".  I used squash, zucchini, white onion and red onion.  I also used dried herbs instead of fresh (just fine).  Followed the rest of the recipe though and is great.  Used it on a veggie sub with provolone. I am a strong believer in using what you have, and this is what I had.  Will do this again and again with many different veggie's.

This is something we often do at home, with different seasonal veggies. Sometimes we add tomato sauce. I've never added balsamic vinegar before, it was quite good. The only thing I did differently was stir the spices and herbs in the same bowl I later added the veggies in. I'll be damned if I dirty more things than I have to, lol.

I have this recipe already from a different site. The only differences there are the following: the oil is only 3 tablespoons and fresh and dry measurements are given for the rosemary and thyme. Dried is 2 tsp. rosemary and 1 tsp. thyme. I usually use a bigger dish for baking, just my preference. Bake time is usually longer.The temperature I use is 425.

THis turned out good using 2 pans but will try 1 next time and cut up the potatoes a little smaller than the other delicate veggies so they all are done together....easier.

I cut the oil down, and they were still too oily for us.  We did really like the flavors, so I will try it again with hardly any oil.

Wonderful recipe. I made it exactly as presented, served at company dinner and the very little leftovers went into scrambled eggs the next day. The fresh thyme and rosemary perfectly compliment all the tasty fresh veggies. A real winner.

I loved this! It was so easy to make and delicious. Instead of balsamic vinegar I used balsamic glaze. My veggies included, the potatoes, sweet potato, sweet red peppers, sweet Maui onion, yellow summer squash, zucchini and Brussels sprouts. I cooked it in the large Pampered Chef Casserole Stoneware. Came out perfect!  I will definitely make this again and again!

This is an awesome way to mix up your standard veggie side dish. Loved the balsamic taste to it. I was out of rosemary and thyme, so I improvised and used montreal steak seasoning, basil, parsley, and oregano, although I am sure it would be better as it's written originally. I will definitely use this again. Thanks!

Made this last year for Thanksgiving instead do the typical sweet potato casserole and it was well loves by everyone. I am making it again is year but will use more sweet potatoes than white potatoes (personal preference). I also had trouble with the cooking time; definitely needed more than 45 min so try roasting the potatoes first and adding peppers and onions later on and then increase the time. Overall a great recipe!

Bravo fantastic treat! I too cooked the firmer veggies 30 minutes and cooked the softer about 15. Can sub so many combinations with this recipe you've got to love that. By the way, I did use all freshly chopped herbs.

yes, this is a great recipe, I skip the bowl, and take a sheet pan, and spray with pam, spread the vegies over the sheet pan and roast, nothing special, just one bowl that doesn't need washing, you and mix and turn on baking sheet, if in the oven you can turn them  over with a utensil that you are comfortable with, enjoy, yummy

I have done vegetables this way for years, although without balsamic vinegar.  I do add garlic. Leaving it to cook long enough for the potatoes to be done only makes the dish brown nicely, but if you wish you can boil the potatoes for a few minutes, before putting them in. I also like parsley over thyme, a personal preference. And even better - you can do them in foil or on a disposable tin pan on the BBQ. I also like mushrooms and brussel sprouts included. Oh - a sprinkling of finely grated parmesan adds a nice touch too.

Great recipe.  Good idea to separate root veggies from softer veg so softer ones won't burn.  See my notes regarding temperature.

Mix marinade and let sit an hour before adding veggies.  Toss all veggies and pull out red pepper and onion and set aside.  Add these the last 10 minutes of cooking.

This is wonderful by itself, but can be turned into a very filling main dish by serving it on top of or mixed into a plate of whole wheat angel hair pasta with vodka sauce. Alfredo would be good also. Serve with a crusty toasted bread lightly brushed with olive oil and it's a perfect meal.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I read a review that mentioned that they used dry herbs and the herbs were overpowering.  It is important to remember when using dried herbs in place of fresh you only use 1/3 of the amount.

I did what others suggested and used baby carrots instead of the squash.  It turned out great!!  I think next time I will add some mushrooms to it.  Great recipe.

This is the first thing I've cooked since chicken and frozen vegetables in about 15 years (no exaggeration). I had a craving for roasted veggies, found this recipe on my phone in the produce aisle. I had to watch videos to figure out how to cut the squash and herbs. (Yes, that's how little I know about cooking.) I never salt my food and didn't include it in the recipe. Next time I probably will add a very tiny bit of salt. Other than that, I was pretty pleased. However, I realized I have a drawer full of knives and not one is sharp enough to cut the squash like on the video. I'll either have to steer away from recipes with things like butternut squash, or go knife shopping.

Next time I will reduce the oil and vinegar a bit. The amount for 6 servings left it a little slimy. Adding oil to anything I will actually consume is something I have NEVER done. (Old eating disorder hang-ups; still somewhat fat phobic at least when I have to add fat to food myself.)

I would agree with others that the potatoes and squash should be cooked for a while before adding the other vegetables. I accidently grabbed parsley at the grocery store, so I used it anyway and the dish was still yummy.

This recipe was REALLY good!  I made it when we had people over for dinner and everyone kept saying over and over how good it was.  We ate it the next few nights for leftovers and it tasted even better!!  I will be making this often!

The fresh herbs made the vegetables very flavorful. For me, the prep time was much longer than 15 minutes. (It took 15 minutes just to cut the butternut squash.)

Really easy and ingredients can easily be added or deleted to your liking.  I make this all the time with whatever veggies I have on hand.  I also change up the herbs and flavored vinegar!  This recipe is easy to manipulate to your taste, so give it a try.  One thing I have learned is that I prefer to cook my root vegetables for about 20 minutes before adding all my other vegetables.  This allows for the same texture throughout and I don't end up with super soft ingredients.  I never have left overs!

Definitely making these again! Threw in mushrooms, carrots, and whole garlic cloves. Cut back on the oil. Did separate the more tender veggies from the root veggies. Deelish!

Fantastic recipe. Great for using all types of vegetables. I did add carrots instead of the sweet potatoes since I didn't have any on hand. Will definitely be using this recipe again and will vary the vegetables.

Love the idea of this recipe. Definitely did my own thing though! I just did red potatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, baby carrots and little chunks of fresh garlic. I tossed it in olive oil, a little vinegar, salt, pepper and chili powder. Popped it in the oven, covered, at 475 for 40 mins then 20 mins uncovered. It was perfect! The chunks of garlic were mushy and adds great flavor! Eveything has its own yummy flavor so why add anything more? You can add just about whatever oh want you be the judge!

These veggies are so delicious!  However, they are tedious to make with having to chop all the veggies.  And squash is not easy to cut!  It all paid off in the end when I tasted these delicious veggies.  I used russet potatoes and lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar since I had those items on hand.  I also used dried seasonings since I had those on hand also.  I can imagine the taste would be even more delicious if using fresh seasonings.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

A tasty, versatile recipe. Contrary to the most popular review, it DOES taste good with dried rosemary and thyme; but, as with all dried herbs, you have to use less than you would with fresh herbs. 

Definitely play with the vegetable variety. The sweet potato and red pepper are my must-haves (so good!), but things like carrots and asparagus are good, too.

I didn't have any thyme, so I added just a bit of basil and garlic powder.  It could use more salt, but I'm trying to stay away from added salt, that's why I added the garlic.  Next time, I'll use fresh garlic! Yum

The recipe was good. But by all means never a foreign have to five-star I would rate this about three stars. It was a medley of flavors. But after about 10 mouthfuls. It ended up being a little bit too sweet for me. Maybe adding a little more of your own spices (essence) I am powder, garlic powder, ground nutmeg would have made this a for now five-star.

This recipe was fantastic! I didn't have any red onions so I used a yellow and I added celery. My husband who doesn't even like sweet potatoes or winter squash LOVED IT! We had a lot of left overs but I'm looking forward to having this for lunch! Great recipe.

Pretty good, fairly easy. Makes a ton! The prep time took me longer than described in the recipe, but that could be my peeling ability. I must say that there were more veggies than would fit on my roasting pan, so some were less 'roasted' than others. Overall good and simple. Will make again...just less of it. :-)

It was awesome. Only thing I did different is roast potatoes separately since they take longer to cook and when veggies were roasted, tossed in the potatoes and it was yummy and my family really impressed.

I made these with the "grilled delmonico steaks" last night from this site.  I thought the sweet potato was great...I followed it to a T, but used yellow summer squash instead of butternut.  I also used only 2 russet potatoes, one red pepper and 1/2 onion, as it only my husband and I.  I think they could use a little more flavor.  Next time I will add more seasoning, but definitely worth making again...thanks!

First of all, I would like to state that I used this recipe to use up some veggies in my fridge. Therefore, I did not stick to the recipe as is. The only veggies I did use were 1 small butternut squash, 1 large turnip, baby carrots, radishes, and onions. I did use the fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and s/p. Next time I WILL make as is but like I stated in the beginning I was just trying to use up some leftover veggies. Served with Roast Leg of Lamb, Radishes with Butter and Salt, and sourdough bread.

I thought that this was good--not great because I felt like it needed more flavor. I used fresh herbs, and doubled the balsamic. I felt like it needed more balsamic, salt, and garlic. I baked mine for 50 minutes- the potatoes and onions should be cut into smaller pieces (because they take the longest to cook). Unique combination of vegetables--which I liked the variety. The traditional: Potatoes, carrots, and onions are good--but it's nice to spruce things up with squash and sweet potatoes.

This is excellent! I do not like bell peppers so I left those out.  I usually don't like rosemary but liked it in this.  If you are looking for something different tonigh, you have found it!

i took some liberties with this otherwise great recipe.  i would up the vinegar to 1/4c; i didn't have any squash, so i ended up using 4 small sweet potatoes, a bag of frozen cauliflower/broccoli/carrot mix, 4 oz. (wt.) mushrooms, 1/2 medium red onion.  i didn't use any fresh seasonings because I didn't have any, but i used what i had (incl. savory and parsley and spike).  was a little burnt in places, but i thought it added character.  i wish it were a bit crunchier, maybe it wasn't because of the extra vinegar.  but, i liked the flavor of teh vinegar.  thanks!

Excellent!  I took the advice of other reviewers to begin baking the potatoes, onions, & carrots (instead of squash) first, then added a separate baking pan later with the red peppers to cook for less time.  I have lots of fresh rosemary and oregano so I used those along with some granulated garlic plus salt & pepper.  I don't usually cook with balsamic vinegar and almost didn't try these because of that ingredient, but this recipe has great flavor & lots of color.  I will be making this again for sure.

I thought these were tastless.  Maybe I didn't add enough salt and pepper.   I prefer my version of roasted vegetables and thats olive oil and a packet of dry onion soup mix.

EASY! I was surprised at how good this was! This is something I'll be making over and over again. The only thing I noticed was the vegetables didn't "brown" like I expected. I made ~3/4 of the full recipe and should have probably taken it out around 35-40min. I left it in for over 45min and the veggies got a little mushy, but it was still delicious. I was worried b/c I used a butternut squash that wasn't quite ripe yet, but it came out just fine. I also used dried thyme and rosemary, but only a pinch of thyme. Make sure you carefully read the conversion from fresh to dried on their containers. Highly recommend this dish!

So simple, healthy and delicious! I usually just use zucchini, red peppers, onions and butternut squash. But I keep the olive oil mixture the same. So so good!!

I love this recipe- and I just found out that you can buy a package of pre-chopped veggies in a 'soup starter' pack (which also includes fresh rosemary and thyme). It was $5 at Safeway and included onions, carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, garlic, rosemary and thyme.

I have always loved my roasted veggies, especially with the addition of balsamic (used a high quality one and used about 3 TBSP).  These were simple, classic and wonderful!  I mixed up the veggies based on what I had on hand and since I did potatoes with dinner last night, I left those out.  Used a combo of peppers, red onion, zuch, and mushrooms.  I didn't have fresh herbs on hand, so used 1 tsp each of dried basil and thyme (no dried rosemary, strange).  Fantastic, will certainly enjoy these leftover, mmmmmm.

Served these for Mother's Day BBQ and they were a big hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I cooked them for 35 minutes, and the veggies were starting to get a little mushy.  Next time I will only cook for 30 minutes.

This was amazing!  Seriously.  Just like the restaurant. I heard my hubs say "OH MY GOD, these vegetables are sooo good!" during dinner! He sounded absolutely delighted, LOL.   And I have to agree!  Definitely made eating veggies an easy task! Going to try mashing them up tomorrow and feeding them to a picky toddler!!!  We'll see how that goes!

Excellent but mild flavor really lets the natural flavors of the veggies come out.  You can't beat it for easy and healthy.

The best mixed vegetable recipe that I have ever made. I followed reviewers tips and cooked the fragile vegetables(onions, peppers and mushrooms) seperate from the other veggies(butternut squash, sweet potato, yukon potato). Fantastic recipe!

I thought this was really delicious. I had only dried herbs.  I made up the dressing hours before and let it sit so the herbs would soften. I also had only potatoes, carrots and celery. I teamed this up with a crockpot apple venison recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

This is really delicious.  I have made it for many friends and family since finding this recipe and they all love it.  I serve it with with baked boneless/skinless chicken on top seasoned with salt, pepper, and rosemary.  It's great serving something that tastes great and guilt-free like this one.  Thanks, Saundra!

I will be making this dish more often.  It had such wonderful flavor and was so easy and fast to make.  We added two carrots and regular Idaho potatoes instead of the golden ones.  I also had Zucchinni which I added.

I've made this recipe on several occasions for both large and smaller crowds and there are never any leftovers! Though I always try to use fresh thyme and rosemary as someone else suggested but on occasion when the store was out of the other, I've used the dried version. It turned out fine though I scaled down the amount of dried spice because it is much stronger (half of the suggested amount was just fine). Thanks Saundra!

Delicious. I made similar roasted veggies but I have never used the rosemary or balsamic before. I use whatever I have around... cauliflower, green beans, etc. Many veggies work well with this. I would put more balsamic in next time, but you can't beat eating veggies this way. Delicious.

Roasted vegetables is such an easy thing to do. I am surprised by some of the comments about never having experienced, much less made something like this. Granted, I hadn't either, until I went to live in England throughout much of the 1990's. Roasted vegetables is such a standard part of -- at the very least -- Sunday Lunch. The oven is going, cooking the roast (whatever kind you enjoy), so it is easy enough to add a pan of vegetables to the oven, too. Roasted carrots, parsnips, along with the potatoes is great. :-)

A healthy and tasty side dish.  I left out the peppers and added a parsnip.  Easily scaled down the recipe too.  This one is a keeper for sure.

Absolutely delicious! The roast beef I made was a complete fail, but the veggies saved the day! I made a couple changes: Didn't have fresh spices so used 1/3 of the amounts of dried (i.e. 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon) as rec by another reviewer. I also let them sit in the liquid for a while. Didn't have regular balsamic, so used white balsamic vinegar. I also baked them at 425 for 50 minutes. I've never cooked butternut squash before and it was delicious. This one's a keeper!

Very good, and easy to put together. I have never used balsamic in my roasted vegetables before, and it was a very nice addition. The cooking time was a little too long for my oven at that temperature, especially for the sweet potato, which tends to burn easily. Next time I will roast at 400 for the same amount of time. thanks!

This recipe is incredibly delicious!  It's easily adaptable to whatever vegetables you have on hand.   This last time, I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used one teaspoon dried thyme, and it was still wonderful.   I've made it in the oven, on the barbecue, and even once over an open fire, as a foil-wrapped bundle.  ***Update:  I've started making this regularly, and varying the veggies according to what I have on  hand.  I've used various squash, parsnips, and carrots in addition to what's in the recipe.  HEALTHY AND TIME-SAVING TIP:   stop peeling those veggies!  The healthiest part of the veggie is in the outer layer.  Just use a vegetable brush to clean the veggies before you chop them.  (If you're concerned about pesticide residues, and you should be, buy organic.)  I've used pumpkin instead of butternut squash, and even pumpkin skin becomes tender once it's roasted.  Thanks or posting, Saundra!

This was great.  I love carmelized root veggies.  I'm going to use the suggestion about putting the root veggies in for about 1/2 hour then add the other veggies. My onions and peppers were a little too crispy on the edges.

Good....nothing crazy amazing but pretty good. I didn't use squash..instead used carrots. The cooking time was a lot longer. I think the whole thing took an hour and a half. I added the tender veggies last 15 minutes.

This smelled delicious, tasted above average but not awesome.  I think to get the taste to match the amazing smell I need to double the sauce (vinegar,oil,herbs).  Trader Joe's makes a roasted balsamic vinegar veggie mix sold in their frozen aisle that smells almost identical to how this recipe smelled - I just wish this tasted as flavorful as TJ's mix.  It's almost there though, I am going to try this again next week just upping the sauce and I'll report back.

You've gotta try this. I've never been big on veggies, sad to say, but I've been eating quite a bit lately, thanks to this recipe. Onions and carrots turn out sweet, and mushrooms are succulent. Easy, cheap, delicious and healthy.

Not bad!  I bought some pre-chopped roasting veggies (about 4 cups) at the grocery store (red, orange, yellow and green bell peppers, red onion, zuccini) and left it at that.  As I have never made roasted veggies and didn't have  much time to spare I used the first one I looked at (this one!).  It was quick because all the chopping was done for me! I only had dry spices but reduced the amount I put in but forgot to reduce the oil! oops!  Will try again with same veggies andmaybe sweet and yukon potato and fresh herbs and less oil!!  Cooking time was 20 minutes for my veggies and was perfect.  If I decide to add potato I will definitely parboil them so the quick cooking vegetables don't get overcooked!

Not bad at all. I agree that it's a good basic recipe and can be used with any combination of veggies. I didn't think I would like the sweet taste of the sweet potato, but it contrasted very nicely with the rest of the veggies.

This has become my new "staple" recipe for dealing with odd and end veggies in the fridge.

It was delicious made it a few times, first time used fresh rosemary and thyme second time used dried but it was too powerful, third time used dried but I reduced it from Tbls sp to tsp sp and it was perfect. I learned from the advice section and equivalency chart that when you substitute dry for fresh herbs then you must use less dry then fresh.

OMG! This is awesome! I have been munching on it straight from the pan!!  Only used baby red potatoes, carrots and onion with all of the seasonings as directed with the addition of garlic salt.  Definitely a 5+!!!

This was really great.  I just used what I had on hand which was sweet potatos, potatos, carrots and onions and fresh garlic chives and fresh thyme.  Turned out very tasty.  And very simple to throw together and very versatile for using up whatever vegies you might have.

I love roasted veggies. I also add chopped carrots and zucchini. A good twist on these is to add a little horseradish sauce to the mix. It really adds a zest!

Excellent!  I used red, yellow and green peppers, red onion, zucchini & carrots. Everything I needed to use up in the refrigerator.
The fresh herbs were great- I also used sea salt and garlic salt.  Roasted at 425 for 15 min- flipped the veggies and baked another 15 min. I think the basalmic made this- don't forget to use it.Wow- what a wonderful aroma in the whole house!

This recipe is a healthy way to use squash and sweet potatoes and still be really tasty.  I didn't have the fresh herbs so I used dried--but cut the amount in half.  It turned out wonderful.

I made the "mistake" of making this for a family dinner last Christmas and it went down so well, I get requested to make it every time now!! I add carrots and parsnips to it. Delicious. The only drawback ius the amount of prep time. I wish someone wold come up with a tool that peels and slices vegetables for you.

Really tasty! Roasting caramelizes the veggies and brings out their natural sweetness. I used whatever I had around, including zucchini, cauliflower florets, sweet potato, onion, carrots, and whole, peeled garlic cloves. Works well to prepare in advance or to use for a potluck since the veggies are also delicious served at room temperature. Great side dish!

Okay, something must have gone wrong.  I roasted veggies for a little over 20 minutes and they were burned when I went back to check them.  The recipe doesn't say to cover them, so I wondering if this is what I should have done.  I was not happy because I buy organic produce.  I would try again, either lowering the temperature or cover them.

This made my house smell amazing! I omitted the white potatoes and added zucchini. I had to use regular vegetable oil instead of olive oil since I'm fasting, and I forgot that I ran out of balsamic vinegar. I seasoned the veggies with the fresh herbs, salt, pepper and several whole garlic cloves and it was really nice!
The only thing was the sweet potatoes were a bit undercooked while the squash was a bit mushy. Next time I will chop the sweet potatoes into smaller pieces and the squash into bigger ones. Delicious, though, thanks!

I loved the idea of this, but found the red peppers too overpowering.  Next time, I'll omit the peppers and use some whole garlic cloves instead.

Took these yummy veggies to a pot luck at church.  People were asking for the recipe.  I used a different variety of vegetables including, carrots, broccoli red onion, green beans, red bell pepper and sugar snap peas.  I added two cloves of crushed garlic to the mixture and tossed well with the remaining ingredients.  When the veggies were done I sprinkled them with some freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Super good.

These are delicious! The onions carmelize so wonderfully...So easy! I took the suggestion of increasing the balsamic to a 1:1 ratio with the oil. Came out great! Will make again in the near future. Such a great healthy dish that tastes wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved these.  We added some carrots in, and used red instead of yukon.  My husband, who hates squash, ate about half of the entire recipe in one sitting.  Yummy.

This recipe was wonderful!  I am always looking for healthy but savory and flavorful dishes and this was definitely one of them.  I actually made my  olive oil mixture in a food processor because although I love rosemary, I don't like big pieces in my dishes.  It worked well.   This was also probably one of the best smelling dishes I've ever made.  I almost wanted my neighbors to happen to stop by so I could brag!  It was great!

Outstanding recipe! The flavors of the different vegetables melded together wonderfully. We followed the recipe exactly as written with one exception. We did cook them an extra 30 minutes as we prefer softer veggies and if they're carmelized a bit, that's fine with us. 

In preparation, it did take quite a while to cut everything, but the time spent was well worth it.  

Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I thought this was "OK".  I will definately not make this again.  Not worth the time for the outcome.  We had left overs and I am eating them, so it wasn't a bad dish, just not something special, or memorable.

Great recipe, good flavor, an easy side dish!  This is so easy, you don't need to make a day head(maybe cut the vegetables up)I tried that and the flavor and presentation was just not quite as good. My company still asked for the recipe though!

Looks like it would've been good, but like the other person said, dried thyme and rosemary will ruin this dish. I don't know how it was supposed to taste, I just know the dried spices drastically overpowered the vegetables. I'm willing to try it again though, it sounds like it would've been very good.

Takes much more time for veggies to get tender than what the recipe called for and the vinegar dressing was bland

yummy. But I'm going to tweek it a little. I don't like squash, so that wasn't in there. But next time I'm going to leave on the skin on the potates since a lot of nutrients are there. Also, I used red potatoes which worked just fine.

This was good, but I think I overcooked it.  It was done earlier than I expected, so I left it covered while I prepared the rest of dinner.  I added halved baby carrots, another red onion, and left out the sweeet potato.  In the future, I would omit the butternut squash (not a fan) and add broccoli like another reviewer mentioned.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic.  I only used 3 TBS. of olive oil and added a little more balsamic- I would add even more balsamic in the future.  Will probably try again with the different veggies.

I wanted to like this recipe, but the cooking time specified is definitely not long enough.  I had to bake the vegetables for almost an hour and a half to get the sweet potatoes soft.

Can use any combination of veg. Added more tender veg. later into the cooking time so they would stay firm. Very good flavor.

This is a great recipe, colorful and delicious.  Even the guys in my household liked this -- and they don't generally like any of the ingredients except the Yukon potatoes!  My vegetables did end up a bit charred, however, so next time I'll either reduce the temperature, reduce the cooking time or set the roasting pan higher in the oven.

This was a great recipe.  I followed it exactly except omitted the butternut squash as I didn't have any on hand.  It still came out great!  Thanks for sharing.  You need to make sure to stir them or they will burn.  Great recipe as you can make it with any veggies you like.

This was excellent! It took me about 20-30 minutes to chop everything (I'm slow). But I anticipated that, so I knew to add more time to what the recipe said. It turned out great, and I thought everything tasted better the second day, when it had time to absorb all the flavors. I'll probably make this again!

I have made this recipe many times and several of them for company.  Since it has so many veggies in one dish you only have to make this ONE.  I have also used the leftovers by pureeing them and adding chichen broth for a great tasting soup the next day.

This was a great side dish to go with a nice piece of meat. Used pumpkin instead of sweet potatoes and turned out good. We have lots of people over from other countries and find that this pleases a lot of other cultures.

This is so good, and so easy!!! I have made this three times, with different veggies each time, and it has come out wonderful! I don't like rosemary so I skip it, and the last time I had to use dried thyme, and it is still good. Be sure to add softer vegetables (summer squash, mushrooms, etc.) during the last 10 minutes or so or you'll have some mush. The second time I made it, I used sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, red and green peppers, carrots, onions, mushrooms and yellow squash. The last time I only had white potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, and asparagus. No matter what I use we like it. Thanks so much!

i have made this dish twice now. i think it's alright, its not my favorite oven roasted vegetable dish. the 2nd time i tried it, i tried adding more seasonings since i found it a bit bland the first time. also, i left it in the oven a bit longer (5-10m) so that the taters could brown a bit, i like them crispy. the seasonings i added were a little bit basil and some seasoning salt. i added about 1/2 more teaspoon for each seasoning called in the recipe. the second time was better, more flavorful and taters were more crispy. but, it's still not my favorite.

I made this as kind of a clean-up-the pantry dish, so used what I had on hand.  I didn't have butternut squash, but had 2 sweet potatoes, and added zucchini as well.  I also used balsamic vinegar salad dressing instead of plain vinegar, as that is what I had on hand.  I turned out quite well, with the vinegar giving it a bit of extra flavor.  I will make it again.

I have made this recipe many times, and each time I get raves.  I change up the vegetables each time, having used carrots, green beans and red potatoes at different times.  I've tried other roasted vegetable recipes, and none compare to this one.

BE SURE TO USE FRESH HERBS!!!  It makes all the difference in the world.

I don't normally like squash or sweet potato...BUT I LOVE them in this dish!!

If you're looking for a way to get your family to eat their vegetables, THIS IS IT! It has become a weekly favorite and ingredients are easily substituted with a variety of vegetables (carrots, beets, celery, etc.)

I have made this many times over the past year.  I have followed the recipe exactly & I have used some of the changes suggested by other reviewers.  I have not been disappointed. I have used other vegetables & I have made it with red potatoes only. This is a great recipe.

Used whole baby yukons and winter buttercup squash instead of butternut.  I think the extra veggies (it was a big squash) meant I should have added a bit more mixture than I did.  The overall flavor was GREAT but a bit mild due to my alterations.  Will add more next time.  Great side dish to prepare in bulk for large gatherings!

Excellent! Took others' advice: lined pan w/foil, sprayed w/Pam. I used red pepper, zuchinni, potatoes, onion, baby carrots & mushrooms. Pre-cooked the potatoes & carrots for 10 minutes then added the rest. Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was a huge success with people of all ages at a large gathering.  I tripled the recipe - using red peppers, zucchini, button mushrooms and red onion.  I had fresh thyme and rosemary and added crushed garlic as well.  Next time I will add portobello mushrooms.  I used some of the leftovers for roasted vegetable quesadillas using monterey jack cheese w/ jalapenos.  Superb!

I let the veggies(and basically any veggie will work) marinate for a few hours, added some garlic, grated some parmesan over the whole thing after baking it and it was a huge hit at my dinner party. Everybody wants the recipe!

I made this the night before, which was convenient, but I didn't think this recipe was any better than other roasted vegetable recipes I have tried in the past.  The flavors melded together too much...vegetables did not maintain their distinct flavors and everthing ended up tasting like potatoes.  For all the trouble it was to chop up all these vegetables, I don't think I will make this again.

Excellent! We used a red onion, yellow onion, squash, zucchini and baby red potatoes. My family wolfed it down like a pack of mad beasts. Thank you! I followed another reviewer and cooked the potatoes first for about 25 minutes, then added everything else. Perfect consistency.

I made these for my daughters wedding and she absolutely loved them.  The only thing different I did was to add chunks of zucchini for more color and I cooked them for only 20 minutes as I was going to be reheating them in chaffing dishes and didn't want soggy veggies.  The multi colors of the veggies against beautiful white plates made for a stunning presentation.

My husband (who isn't a big fan of vegetables) has asked for this again!  I found it took a lot longer to peel, cut etc. than the 5 minutes indcated on the recipe.  I used Mrs Dash and Italian seasonings instead of rosemary and it was good that way.

I made this and got raves from everyone!  I think the lemon works best. Also, I roasted the vegetables more like 60 minutes to make them soft and really sweet...it may just be my oven that caused the additional cooking time.

The veggies themselves browned beautifully, but I thought that the herbs gave a slightly bitter taste (just a personal thing). I may have liked it more if the coating was simply an olive-oil, salt combo. Otherwise the combo, color, texture was great.

Love roasted vegetables!
For added color I used one yellow and one red bell pepper; added cauliflower in place of butternut squash, and added garlic cloves (cut in big chunks) 'love the garlic'. 
I used balsamic glaze, preferring a stronger flavor. Best to drizzle the glaze directly on the vegetables, then add the oil-spice mixture and toss to coat.
I used 1 teaspoon dried thyme, didn't have fresh (remember to adjust measurement between dried and fresh). I did have fresh rosemary from my garden, but only used 1 tablespoon. I find these herbs to be a bit bitter.
I used baby gold potato's cut in half. I like the look of little potato compared to cubes. I microwaved the gold and sweet potato's, and cauliflower till slightly cooked. It helps everything cook evenly with other ingredients when in the oven. NO hard potato's please. I also wanted brussel sprouts, which I cut in quarters and microwaved them slightly, but DANG! if I didn't get distracted and forgot them in the microwave. I confess, I found them next morning. Yuk.
I reduced the temp to 450 for 50 minutes. This is a colorful dish, although the vegi's brown out when reheated next day.
 I made this dish for a special church potluck, they ate it all.  I found out later, one of our dinner guests loved it so much, he sneaked a bowlful to take home. He couldn't stop raving about this delicious dish.
My next batch will include mushrooms and, of course, brussel sprouts; and maybe basil as mentioned in another review. Mini roma t

Delicious.  A bit time-consuming to prep all of the vegetables, but well worth it.  Ingredient changes: I used 1 tsp. dried thyme, 2 tsp. dried rosemary, 1/8 c. oil, 3 T. balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp. garlic powder,  1 tsp. basil 2 red onions and 2 bunches of broccoli.  Recipe changes: I mixed the herbs first to blend the flavors, and preheated the oven to 450. I used 2 baking sheets with parchment paper cut to size, lightly sprayed with Pam.  I put the onions, potatoes, and squash (root veggies) in first, covered with foil.  After 10-15 minutes, I added the peppers and broccoli and covered with foil.  Cook with foil covering for first half, then remove for 2nd half so veggies brown up nicely.  Make sure to stir every 10 minutes or so, and total cooking time is 30-40 minutes.  I will try baby carrots, zucchini, new potatoes, grape tomatoes and mushrooms in the future. I added these to my lunch for a week and they were so good!

The vegetables tasted great. I should have made sure there was only one layer. Because I layered them, it took the vegetables much longer to cook.

Very good. This has become a staple using different types of vegetables. However, smoke point of EVOO is around 375-400 degrees, so we roast longer at lower temp to keep the olive oil flavor.

I didn’t think my kids and husband will like it, I was wrong!! Everyone kept asking for more! I didn’t put onions, but added garlic powder and was wonderfully flavored. The only thing is that it took more than 45 minutes to cook, so I will take that into consideration... because I am doing it again! Thank you

Wonderful recipe, use it every week and never get tired of it. I agree the potatoes need to go in first for 10 min since they cook slower than other vegetables.

This was excellent.  Roasting is my favorite way to cook vegetables.  As someone else suggested, you can use many different combinations of vegetables using this method.  I did set the oven at 400 degrees to cook another dish.  I just roasted the vegetables longer till they carmelized, stirring them every 20 minutes or so.

Delicious! I agree that it's best the first day and would suggest portioning so you won't have leftovers.  I used several prior reviewers' suggestions,  including using parchment paper (talk about easy cleanup!); cooking the root vegetables 15-20 minutes before the peppers, eggplant, mushrooms, etc.; and drizzling the olive oil rather than using 1/4 cup.  I had no burning from the 475-degree oven. A staple and easily adaptable recipe, to be sure!

BEST ROASTED VEGETABLES I HAVE EVER MADE!!  I used whatever veggies I had in the fridge, which happen to be baby carrots, green bell pepper, broccoli, onion, and russet potatoes.  I took the advice of others and put the carrots and potatoes in the oven to cook for 30 minutes, then added bell pepper, onion, and broccoli and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.  Everything was cooked perfectly. I mixed the oil, balsamic, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl then poured the mixture over all of the veggies, lightly coating them.  Several people have said not to use dried herbs in this recipe.  I used them and thought it turned out great although fresh herbs are preferred.  The key is to keep in mind that the measurements for dried herbs vs fresh is different.  1 tbsp fresh does not equal 1 tbsp of dried.  A small amount of dried goes a long way, use very sparingly.  I used just a pinch of the thyme and rosemary and added salt and pepper.  I will definitely be cooking my veggies this way for now on.

Yummy!  Served this at a potluck and got lots of good comments.  I didn’t have fresh time so I ended up using an Italian seasoning mix, dried. And it worked great.

This is absolutely fantastic! I added fresh cloves of garlic and MAN! Delicious!!!!!! Make sure you watch the timer and turn the veggies every ten minutes to avoid over-browning. This is going to be a winter must-have in my household from now on. Good stuff!

Ignore the most critical reviews - obviously these people can't read. This recipe clearly calls for fresh rosemary and thyme and the people who left low stars are the only ones who deserve them for thinking dried herbs in a recipe that calls for baking will work as well as fresh. Dried herbs don't emit the same fragrances and oils as fresh herbs do in the oven because they have already been in the oven. It's sense! 

This recipe is delicious and great to make in bulk. I section mine off into portions and freeze them, then throw them in with the rest of my meal prep for the week.

Very easy and lends itself to adding your favorite vegetables. I used the recipe adding Brussel Sprouts and garlic for a little variation. Fresh rosemary and thyme are essential. A wonderful food that can easily be reheated.

I mixed red potatoes and real carrots (sliced to be about baby carrot size) onions and a few cloves of garlic with the onions mixed in one bowl with enough oil/balsamic mixture to coat. I used fresh thyme and 1 tbsp of Italian seasonings since there was no fresh rosemary available at the market. In a second bowl I combined zucchini and yellow bell peppers and finish tossing with the rest of the oil/balsamic mixture. I put the potatoes and carrot bowl in a glass pan with a little bit of  plain oil in the bottom of the pan and cooked for about 40 mins. I planned to add the zucchini and bell peppers in the same pan but I was afraid they would finish cooking at separate time so I added them to another pan and cooked for about 20 mins. Then I added all the vegetables together once they were out of the over. I'm no cooking expert but It came out tender and delicious and released the natural flavor of the vegetables!

Very easy to make and delicious. I wanted to make a healthy, vegan side dish for Thanksgiving and came across this recipe. I added portobello mushrooms and it actually made double the amount I thought it would. Which was perfect! Everyone enjoyed it.

This is soooo good. I used all veggies ( already had a potatoe dish planned to go with the dinner) . Asparagus, tri colored carrots ( i par boiled for about 4 min prior to roasting) red bell peppers, red onions, yellow squash. Used the gallon bag to toss the vegetables in the oil/herb mixture. Sprinkled with  garlic salt and covered with foil for first half of cooking. I was worried the asparagus would get scorched but it all came out perfect . YUMMY!

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly as written. It was wonderful. My veggies were all done together perfectly.  Nothing mushy, no smoking olive oil, my pan cleaned up easily.  I just enjoyed down leftovers for lunch today.  Thank you for sharing a great way to enjoy veggies.  My husband loved them too!

Good but too much rosemary and I added 4 cloves of minced garlic to the vinaigrette, I added the peppers in the last 15 minutes and changed the cooking temp to 375.  Next time I will use less rosemary.

Delicious! Paired this with tender Salmon and brown rice for a absolutely aromatic, delicious lunch! For seasonings I used seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and lemon pepper and I switched out Yukon potatoes for red potatoes and added baby carrots chopped in half. Best way to eat veggies!!

Found this recipe for my husband's cooking group of guys.  Turns out it was a hit!  If you've never liked roasted veggies, you'll love it made this way.  
 I made it again in California using  "sweet potatoes" which are marketed in the grocery store looking very  white.   The whole dish lacked flavor. Use "yams" if you can't get the orange colored sweet potatoes. I live in Georgia where sweet potatoes are marketed looking as orange  as the butternut squash.

This recipe is billed as "easy to prepare" but it is actually quite labor intensive to chop all the ingredients and then have to keep stirring while roasting. I did use fresh herbs but the flavors really didn't blend well together. It wasn't the worst thing I've eaten but it really wasn't worth the amount of effort involved.

This is an excellent recipe!  I added zucchini and some baby broccoli because I had some, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It took almost a little over an hour to cook, but turned out well.  Do be sure to cut your sweet potatoes and squash smaller than the softer vegetables or they won't be done at the same time.

This is so good!  I made it when I entertained some guests for dinner.  The side dish accompanied a Gorgonzola stuffed chicken recipe I got from this site.  It has both veggies and potatoes...no need for any other side dishes and it looks so colorful.  I made it early in the day and wrapped it in foil.  Put it in the oven with my chicken the last twenty minutes or so to heat it...perfect!

This is definitely a keeper, I was a bit apprehensive about using balsamic vinegar, but it was great and did not taste sour.
Also the temperature was higher, then I  have normally , which improved the nice crunchiness of the veggies .
Next time I will line the roasting dish with baking paper, to save on cleaning.
A great winter dish.

I've made this twice now. Soooo good! The second time we made it a little outside of the recipe (used yellow instead of butternut squash, forgot to put in balsamic vinegar, cooked for 40 min at 425F instead of 475F) and it was still very good. This recipe never fails!

This is really good. Tried adding different veggies. Threw in green beans for last 15 minutes and the bright green color looked good and added interested taste.

Delish! So I left out the squash and added baby quartered red potatoes and shiitake mushrooms. I didn't have fresh rosemary nor thyme, so I used dried. Here's a tip: I put oil, balsamic vinegar, dried herbs,  s & p, into a jar; shook it up, and stored it over night in fridge.  This allowed all the flavours in that jar to marry each other. Prepared the dish the following day.  This recipe doubles well.

I absolutely love this easy and tasty recipe !! I am completely addicted to it and it is perfect for a healthy and nourishing meal !! 
Two things I modified: I didn't use balsamic vinegar and I only added 1 tbsp of olive oil - I prefer my veggies au naturale. 
Highly recommend it and be aware: this will be your new favourite veggie side dish !!

I have made this dish dozens of times and I agree with LDitty to cook the root veggies first. It's hearty and healthy. It's easy to swap different veggies in and out depending on what's in season.

Perfect recipe, very easy to make, and totally de-mystified veggie roasting for me. I added smoked sausage to my roasted veg and it made a complete meal that we both enjoyed.

This is one of our favorite dishes, and oh, so versatile using various combinations of vegetables. Love it as written, but one of our favorite combinations is to use purple passion potatoes, Yukon Golds, onion, and carrots, without the Balsamic in this case. I always roast at 425 degrees and it turns out great, in 30-45 minutes. 475 is just too hot for olive oil and not necessary.

I thought it was great. I had some broccoli and cauliflower that I put in. Didn't have any sweet potato. I used dried thyme and I would probably cut the amount next time, but I still found it delicious.

These vegies rocked!  I make this all the time now changing the veggie combo every time.  You must use fresh herbs.  If you don't have fresh herbs, make something else.  Don't cut your veggies to big or they won't cook and also don't cut too small as they will shrivel up.  This is something that turned out better each time.

Very good! I used dried thyme and it was fine. I don't have any Rosemary. 475 degrees was to high - my veggies burned! I turned the oven down to 420. Will make again.

AWESOME  only thing for me ws  cook those carrots first they take forever.Delicious the next day.I have made this so many times now with different veggies. Make more than you think it tends to shrink up a bit and  people eat a lot of this. My whole family gets excited for the mushrooms and asparagus the most , potatoes, carrots ,onions, they love it all. Even the I only eat pizza son. Thanks for putting vegetables back in my life

I made this tonight for my wife and I to go with Irish Steaks. It was a wonderful, yet simple recipe and came out great. I look forward to adding a few different kinds of vegetables and trying it again soon.

Wow, great recipe.  Didn't change a thing. The store didn't have any fresh thyme so I had to used dried, but that was okay.  The caramelization I got on some of the vegetables was so delicious!  This recipe came in handy when I was cooking dinner for those with allergies and specific diets.  Prepared it the night before and cooked the day of!  Easy! Thank you!

I love this recipe! I made it for Sukkot and everyone loved it! I will make it again!  It is annoying to ahve to keep opening the oven and mixing them, but it was worth it in the end.

Yummy yummy, tried this dish with grilled salmon & toast bread for dinner and the whole family enjoyed it. We love the potatoes to be soft so I boiled the potatoes till about half cook before slicing them up into cubes. Leave out the thyme as I do not have them but added more fresh rosemary from my garden and they tasted good. Substituted sweet potatoes with baby carrots and shitake & white mushrooms. Will definitely be a good dish for party, look and taste wonderful! Thanks Saundra for sharing such a wonderful dish. Cathy

This recipe is excellent: easy, presents beautifully & delicious! I made 1 1/2x the amount and my family ate nearly all of it. I didn't have a butternut squash, so I used one large yellow squash, mushrooms and 5 small peppers (differing colors except green, which is too bitter). It is a must to use fresh rosemary! I used very little dried thyme and added a dash of dried oregano & basil respectively. I don't use salt, so I used vegetable "salt", a great seasoning & salt solution. I definitely placed this recipe in our regular meal rotation!

Loved this. Make sure pan is large enough so that the veggies can spread out and get a bit crispy (can get too soft if all too close together. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was unable to get this to cook with in an hour. Maybe I cut the potatoes too big. Or maybe the baby carrots were too much.

These are amazing roasted vegetables! I used carrots and mushrooms, but no sweet potato. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar, so I was concerned how I would like it. I got multiple compliments from guests. Even the next day, reheated in the microwave they were so so good. I will try even less olive oil next time.

Very good! I used fresh Rosemary and 1/2 the Thyme because I only had dried on hand otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I loved it!! I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and put the onions and red peppers in after 30 minutes of cooking the root veggies. Perfectly done. Even my 3-year-old son ate it which I was surprised as he's going through a phase of not wanting to eat anything but carbs. Thank you, wonderful dish!

Made many times! Roasted all the vegetables I could get my hands on: sweet potatoes, portobellos, broccoli, zucchini, eggplant. It all turned out great! I did use less oil (3 tbsp) and cooked in 2 batches. Potatoes, squash, & onion in 1 baking dish. Everything else went in another baking dish & into the oven 20 minutes later. Cook until veggies are at the desired texture. Clean up isn't a problem. Great leftovers! Delicious every time!

Fabulous!  Made it as part of Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!  Even better was that all of the prep work can be done ahead of time!  Followed the recipe exactly - only change was I followed the advice of another reviewer who suggested adding the more delicate vegetables once the potatoes/onions were almost done.  Presentation was beautiful with all the colors and very flavourful!

Very, very good! Rick and I made these as described except using dry thyme and lowering the temp to 450. Next time I might not bother with white potatoes of any sort as the Yukons lent the least flavor to the dish. Also would make smaller cubes of the veggies to quicken the cooking time.

Wow this combination of veggies and herbs is something special. I cut the red peppers into small squares so that I could get some in each bite. Very healthy and a big hit with some very picky eaters in my family. Thanks we will make this again and again.

Marvelous!  I made this tonight for the first time for a dinner party, and it was so delicious!  It's a good idea to put the potatoes in 10 minutes or so earlier than the rest.

I didn't have fresh rosemary or thyme but took a chance on this recipe based on the reviews - used a bit of kosher salt and ground pepper,  1 tsp ground thyme and 2 tsp of a dried greek seasoning blend I had on hand (garlic, oregano, rosemary). I baked it on a pampered chef bar pan for about 40 mins (mixed it around a few times). This may be my new favorite food!!! The mix of the potatoes, the butternut, peppers and onion is incredible. I'm looking forward to playing more with different spices as well as trying with fresh rosemary and thyme someday.

I have found that when I don't have the fresh herbs called for, use 1/2 half of dried herb. It works well but, obviously, fresh is always better.

We love this recipe and make it frequently.  I vary the veggies according to season sometimes adding quartered tomatoes or chunks of zucchinis.  Slice some sausages and spread on top before roasting!  Wonderful meal

Came out very good I used what I had on hand.  Sweet potato, 1/2 red pepper, baby carrots, 1 onion, garlic, white potato and fresh herbs.  The only thing I was busy with too many things and I didn't keep turning the veggies which left them soft instead of crunchy like I think it's suppose to be.  We all still liked it a lot even my dogs I made enough for them also minus the onion.  Thank you!

This is a great dish. The suggested veggies are good choices, and the flavoring works perfectly. Don't forget to consider spraying non-stick spray, as the veggies will be tough to clean off after roasting.

I absolutely loved this recipe, especially its flexibility. You could simply make potatoes this way, or carrots, or squash... The possibilities are endless. I made this exactly as the recipe is written, and I loved the melange of flavors from the different vegetables. This went very well as a side with grilled chicken.

Good recipe. I followed it exactly as written except I placed mine on a foil covered cookie sheet. Next time I will try it in a shallow roaster. I think it would have turned out even better. I agree with another reviewer to cook it at 450 and it's so important to stir veggies every 10 min or they will not evenly brown. I will definitely make it again!

I made the mistake of using dried herbs and DO NOT recommend it - next time I will use fresh herbs as directed! Still gets 5 stars from me since the error was my own, and it is a lovely dish I will surely make again. Thanks Saundra!

Oh. My. Goodness!  This was so incredibly good!  I cubed everything really small,  and i used a little less sweet potato (not really a fan, but in this recipe, I loved it!)  I used 2 sweet potatoes, and 2 red peppers and 1 onion per 3lbs of red potatoes.  I also omitted the squash.  (It wasn't in season.)  To me, it was delish.  :)  I served it for company with crunchy-coated honey ham, a couple other sides.  The potatoes were gone first!

This was delicious. I added a tsp of garlic powder and also added broccoli. I did cook the potatoes and squash for 20 min. before adding peppers, onion, and broccoli, otherwise they would have been mush.

This recipe was really good.  Cut your root vegetables into pieces not much bigger in any direction than one inch.  I used dried herbs but ground the rosemary so it wouldn't be hard.  I made mine with baby potatoes, onions, sweet potatoes and carrots.  They were all good but the only component that was truly delicious was the sweet potato.  It absorbed more of the flavour.  I'll make it again with just sweet potatoes and maybe parsnips too.

I made this for a dinner party and it came out fantastic! I read through many of the reviews and made a few changes based on what other people had written. Specifically I put the potatoes into the oven before the other vegetables, allowing them to cook for about 15 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients and cooking for another 30-35 minutes. I also used dried rosemary a thyme and quartered the measurements for both. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I got several compliments from other people at the dinner on how great it turned out, and I loved it too! I will definitely be making this again.

The first time I made these I substituted carrot for butternut squash but the second time I made these I used all the correct ingredients, I must say it tasted good both times but it was excellent with the butternut squash.

Even the kids gobbled this up.   I used red, yellow and purple new potatoes.  I think the butternut squash was my favorite.  My guests were really impressed.  They really raved about the gourmet veggies......so simple too.

I enjoyed this dish.  I really wanted a good ratio of seasoning and oil and I wasn't disappointed with this recipe - the flavors mixed very well.  I used potatoes, squash, onion and bell peppers (1 red and 1 green), but I will use whatever vegetables I have on hand. This is very versatile, which is great and very easy to make.

This was fabulous!!  I used 4 zucchini squash (I haven't ever been successful at peeling butternut squash - too tough), sliced up the onion more than called for, added a green bell pepper (I had one that needed using up), 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  I followed another's suggestion and divided the oil into two bowls - one with the potatoes and one with the rest.  I roasted the potoatoes first (15 minutes), then added the rest on top, and roasted an additional 15 minutes.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

A very well put together grouping of vegtables.  I liked the sweetness of the red onion.  My family doesn't like unions but ate these.

May try replacing the squash with aspargus for a change (at my daughter's request).  Very good as described though.  I did substitute dry herbs and it was fine as long as you don't replace them 1:1 (used about 1/3).

Depending upon thickness of veg this may be finished in 30 min.

This was so delicious!  My husband and I loved it. As other reviewers, I just used the vegetables that I had: potatoes, carrots, zucchini, celery, onions, sweet mini peppers,and garlic.  I only added salt, pepper, and dry Italian seasoning only because it was what I had that was close to the original recipe. I roasted the potatoes and carrots at 375 degrees for about 20-25 min before including the other vegetables (to prevent burning of the more fragile veggies as suggested), being sure to stir well so that the olive oil and balsamic vinegar coated them well. I added additional salt and pepper as well. The total cooking time was about 40-45 min. Very pleased with the result and will definitely make this again.

I have made this many times and it is one of our favorite. I used dried thyme and rosemary instead of fresh, but it was still simply wonderful. My children have also eaten this and I have a 6,5,2 yr old.

Loved the recipe and will definitely cook it again. Pretty much followed the recipe but used zuchinni and yellow squash in lieu of butternut. I'm not usually a fan of sweet potato but loved it in this recipe. Also, took others advice and cut potatos into smaller pieces. Also cooked root vegetables for first 20 minutes and then added the rest. Didn't have fresh thyme so used dried thyme leaves and it came out great.

This was easy and quick. I had a yellow squash and a zucchini left over from a casserole and wanted to use them before they spoiled. I went to the site and typed in roasted vegetables and i choose this one. I also added onion brussel sprouts and bell pepper. I used dried herbs i also added white pepper. A keeper.

This is one of the only recipes that I don't alter while making.  It's time consuming to prep and bake all those veggies but it's totally worth it!  The giant batch is a lot of food but it reheats well.

I followed the suggestion to roast the root vegetables for 30 minutes before adding the more "delicate" veggies for the last 15 min. and they all turned out perfect!

This is awesome!  So flavorful, I could eat the whole pan myself.  I never put in the sweet potato, but if you liked them, it would be good!  The balsamic vinegar makes this dish!!

this is my favorite vegetable dish! so good all year round...tips, make sure you stir up every 10 minutes or they don't cook evenly and be careful when preparing squash....tough to clean and cut but worth the effort

Love it! My kids have been asking to eat leftovers and my husband (who swears he hates all things squash and sweet potato) Loves it!  I didn't have fresh thyme so I substituted fresh sage, and it was very good.

This has become a Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition in my family.   The beautiful fall colors and the exquisite flavors combine to make a dish that is absolutely fabulous!  I'm not a cook, and finding something to bring to holiday feasts was always a problem.  But Saundra has given me a recipe that is always a hit.    Thank you!

Simple yet excellent flavor. Best to eat soon out of the oven--it can dry out quite a bit. Definitely wonderful with the fresh spices. It's worth the small amount of extra effort.

Yummy!! I was looking for a way to get my boyfriend (whose main diet has been bacon and fast food since he moved out of his parents place) to eat more veggies. He loved it! I couldn't find fresh thyme or rosemary, so I used 2 teaspoons of dried Italian herbs instead. Next time I would cut the onion a bit smaller, to really get it nicely mixed in.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe (I made exactly as written) but I think I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to roasted veggies.  Worth trying, just not for me.

This was fantastic with one change--I halved the Rosemary and Thyme. Perfect and a great way to get more vegetables in my diet! (still fine with full amount of spices but just not my preference)

This is really good and very flexible. You can use any vegetables that wil hold up to roasting. It's a little time consuming but overall pretty easy. I used this recipe a lot when my kids first started eating solid food because it is was a great way to give them a variety of vegetables that were all soft enough for them to chew.

Didn't have the vinegar, so just left it out. I have used both cut up russets & red potatoes with success. The flavor is great. Next time I'm thinking of tossing the veggies with chicken broth with the oil to cut down a little on the greasy film the veggies tend to have.

This was very good! I did separate the potatoes and baby carrots from the other veggies. I cooked  them longer and added the others when I had 20 minutes left. I do think that it needs a little more seasoning so I will add more to mine next time. Otherwise this was a great recipe and one I will use again.

I have made this for years!  Try using asparagus - Awesome!!  Also for something different, omit the vinegar and grate fresh parm over the veggies when they come out!  Also different spices work just as well.

This was so tasty. I didn't have butternut squash, but I replaced it with yellow squash and used a mix of red and green pepper. My cooking time took about 50 minutes, but my casserole dish was pretty deep.   Only a few bites in I was already sure that I'll be breaking this out for all family and friend visits and special occasions. Thanks for sharing, this is great.

I really liked this dish even though I didn't have a sweet potato, I used dried herbs (reduced quantities by half) and left out the peppers since my husband doesn't like them.  Yum!

balsamic brings a tangy sweetness to the veggies. make sure to use FRESH herbs with this! I used red and yellow bell peppers, red onion, baby carrots, and mushrooms.

Lot more healthy than what my fam prefers but it was all gone at end of meal.  Even picky eaters ate large serving. I cut pieces a little smaller.

Incredible alternative to traditional (boring) vegetables.  OK to adjust oven temperature to 450 or 400 to keep hot as other things are cooking.  Most of our guests took seconds or thirds!  A winner.

This recipe is similar to what I make using my grill basket on the BBQ in the summer. We love it! Even my 9 month old was shovelling it down :) I didn't have any squash or white potato, so I added some zuchini, mushroons and parsnips instead. I also did not have fresh herbs, but found the dried worked well. Used same amount in tsp. This is definitely a keeper and is very versatile. It will work with whatever you have in your kitchen!!!

I roasted brussel sprouts that I cut in half along with small red potatoes quartered.  They were nice with our dinner but I only roasted them at 375 for about 45 minutes while we drove around looking at Christmas lights!  They were perfect! :)

I love this recipe as written and have used the method as written many times, but unlike some other reviewers I actually like it better with dry herbs (scaled down on the amounts, of course).  When I've used fresh rosemary, it always seems burnt and bitter to me, in a bad way.  I also prefer it without the vinegar, but that may be just me too.  However you choose to tweak it and whichever vegetables you pick, it's still great and it always makes a great go-to side for pot-lucks.

This recipe came out good. Will defintily leave out the butternut squash next time, and use more sweet potato as it is awesome roasted!!  I put the potatoes and squash in 30 minutes longer then the other veggies and everything came out perfectly cooked.  I also added some zucchini.  Had to use a lot of salt and double the balsamic.  Overall pretty good, also made great leftovers, the flavors seemed to develop more overnight.

Delicious!  Only change I made was to use carrots instead of red bell peppers (don't like bell peppers and love carrots).  Otherwise followed the recipe to a T and it was very tasty!   I actually put the whole thing together in the early afternoon and stuck it in the fridge until I started dinner preparations about 4 hours later.  I was a little afraid that the dressing would be too strong after the vegetables marinated in it for four hours, but the flavor was perfect for our taste.   Served with fresh lamb chops from the local butcher and it was a great meal.  Thank you Saundra for a recipe that we really enjoyed!

The flavor of dried herbs is intense -- you should cut the amount by 2/3 if you substitute dried for fresh herbs in any recipe.  I used fresh and this was wonderful as written!  I wouldn't change a thing!

This is delicious...the balsamic vinegar adds wonderful flavour.  The sky is the limit in terms of veggies you can use.  I often add zuchini and eggplant, but near the end so it doesn't get mushy.

This makes delicious, healthy and colorful side dish! My husband and I absolutely loved it! Instead of fresh herbs I used a half of bag of "Toasted Onion & Garlic" potato seasoning. It turned out great!

Outstanding - used just red skinned potatoes cubed and baked in glass casserole loosely covered with foil.  Used for dinner party and was a hit.  This is a keeper.

So delicious!! Even my fiance, the avid carnivore, dove in for seconds! I didn't change out any of the ingredients and I made sure the veggies were cut small like another poster said to avoid uncooked veggies while others got mushy. I also did the cook 1/2 the time with foil cover and 1/2 without to avoid mushy veggies. My fiance mixed this recipe with "Flat Iron Steak with Balsamic Reduction" and  they played together beautifully (although the 1st time around, I burned the sauce and didn't include it). As a leftover, I mixed with a Vegan version of "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" and it was gorgeous! Great recipe!!

Amazingly good and yet so simple! I doubled the recipe to feed a family gathering. Also spent $3 on some big foil roasting pans that worked great for cooking it and threw away for easy clean up! Also used pearl onions so they were bigger than slices of onion. And we cut up fresh green beans for color, which actually turned out fantastic (and I normally hate green beans!). The dish looks fantastic with yellow and orange potatoes (yukon and sweet), red peppers, green beans and white pearl onions. So pretty!! Not to mention that the herbs and vinegar combo tastes great too! It's a win/win recipe!

Our favored veggies were the red peppers, then the onions.  We had a couple problems with this recipe.  The Yukon gold potatoes were very dry and not tasty; some of the sweet potatoes were overdone and mushy.  I swapped carrots for the squash (only I barely like squash) and they were cooked perfectly.  I also added a few leftover mushrooms for the last 10 minutes and they were excellent.  I will say that as I've been reheating the veggies, I really believe the flavors of this recipe are a '5'.  The Yukon Golds tho still don't seem to have a lot of flavor.  I had huge Yukons, so maybe that was part of the problem.

I love roasted vegetables.  My roommate doesn't.  But everyone in my family does, and all my friends do, as well.   I made this exactly as written, and it's a hit every single time.

This was wonderful. Many different vegtables could be added. I took other's advise and cooked the potatoes first for 20 minutes, then added the more delicate vegtables for another 20. My husband liked it so much he was asking for leftovers the next day.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I added some minced garlic to the dish for added flavor.  It makes alot for two people, so you may want to cut the recipe down unless you are having company.  Will make again.

Very good.  I added some vegetables that I had that I knew wouldn't keep in the fridge any longer.  I'll make this again.  I suggest using a cooking spray, I needed two pans for this, and I forgot to spray one of them.  Everything stuck to the bottom.

This is one of my family favorites.  I've used dried spices and it turned out fine, you just have to use a lot less.  I've added carrots and zucchini (toward the end) and they make a great complement as well.

This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I would change next time is to throw certain veggies (broccoli & whatnot), in later.  The broccoli burnt a bit and was a little mushy.

Made this a few times now both as called for and then with what I had. Both ways are wonderful and super easy!! Either fresh/dry herbs work..I cleaned my fridge out and used zucchini, yellow squash, a couple of potatoes, japanese eggplant and asparagus. For good measure I threw in a few whole cloves of garlic and it was wonderful!! Thanks for the recipe

This is a great recipe. I've made it with fresh herbs and also dried herbs. Fresh is best, but if you don't have them, don't let that stop you from making this side dish. I had zucchini that I added and it added green to the already colorful dish. I'm making it again tonight with extra to cut up to fill omelets tomorrow morning.

It was good but I think next time I would leave out the squash and the sweet potato.  I would then add some carrots.  The sweet veggies may it too sweet.

These vegetables were wonderful. I LOVED the full and tangy flavor of the vinegar and the thyme and it was always a nice surprise to bite into the sweetness of a sweet potato amongst all the other strong vegetable flavors. 

The only thing I did wrong was to use dried whole thyme. I do not really like to keep fresh spices around because I never seem to use them in time so I use dried. The toughness of the dried "whole" thyme was a little annoying, even though it was a nice flavor so I already bought ground thyme for next time.

This was really good, but mine was nowhere near done after 40 minutes!  Maybe my roasting pan was not big enough, as I used a deep pan and it was fairly full.  After the first 40 minutes I added foil and left them in for another 20 minutes without stirring, then took the foil off and left them in another 10 minutes.  The vegetables had good flavor but I think I will need some time to perfect this recipe.  Only change was that I used garlic infused olive oil for extra flavor.  I've also made this with sweet potatoes, yams, parnips, zucchini, brussels sprouts, shallots, and whole cloves of garlic - yum!

I made this recipe using butternut squash, red pepper, red onion, carrots,  mushrooms, fresh thyme and rosemary. My dinner guests thought it was amazing. As a little extra I sprinked goat cheese over it before serving. This one's a keeper!

Again, I have to echo other reviewers' sentiments stating that you must use FRESH rosemary and thyme for best results. Also, I found the the variety of veg listed in this recipe to be a bit high -- so I used only half the amount of potatoes (I used small red potatoes cut in halves, smaller than other veg pieces since potatoes cook slower than other veg), mushroom, red onion, zucchini, yellow squash, butternut squash, baby carrots. This turned out to be a favorite among my friends when I served at a dinner party. I think the balsamic vinegar really brings the flavor together. Highly recommend!

I LOVE this recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the directions to a T, but what I've learned since then is that this is a GREAT base recipe. I've taken this same recipe and made a variety of different veggie combinations and every time it turns out wonderfully. You really do need to use fresh herbs, you can throw in additional herbs too (sometimes I add a little tarragon or mint) makes the difference in this recipe.

This was verrrrry good! I made this for my MIL whjo is a HUGE food snob, and actually, she complimented me on this dish. I didnt have squash, but I did have a few carrots so i used them instead. I also didnt have rosemary so I left that out all together but seasoned heavily with salt and pepper. This wasnt hard to make and the end result was delcious. I will make this again real soon!

I used this recipe as a template (used potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, carrots, and garlic cloves, yum!), since roasting veggies is a really flexible affair. I loved the addition of the balsamic vinegar - subtle but worth it! The one thing I will say is that this will NOT be ready after 40 min in the oven. I cut my potatoes very small, about 3/4- to 1/2-in. cubes, and they still take more than an hour to be cooked through and not crunchy. Just plan accordingly, though, and you'll enjoy the results of this recipe! Having this is like Thanksgiving whenever I want :) Thanks!

I used different vegetables - this recipe is so versitile and delicious! I make a delicious appitizer with this recipe - I spread chummus on rectangular wraps, then spread some of these roasted vegetables down the middle and fold it up (the chummus acts like a glue and keeps the wrap from opening. I stick 4 tooth picks inside and cut the wrap on a slant into 4 pieces! What a great recipe!

My husband isn't a big vegetable eater. He's out of town, so I took the opportunity to try out this recipe. The sweet potatoes were my favorite. I could have eaten an entire bowl of the roasted sweet potatoes. I kept the veggies in the oven for the full 40 minutes and that was a tad too long.  I'll have to try and come up with some ingredients that I think I can get my husband to eat and try this again when he's home.

I have tried this recipe few times in summer but for some reason I enjoyed it better in winter, served with roast lamb and home made traditional mint sauce.

Wow, this recipe was excellent!  My sister made for Easter dinner, and it was a huge hit that I HAD to get the recipe!  A few things she changed: She marinated the veggies overnight, added in 4-5 whole cloves of garlic, and threw in some carrots and zucchini.  Yum!

This recipe was pretty good.  I am only giving it a four though because it definitely wasn't the best I've had and I couldn't make it with what I had on hand because of the fresh herbs.  So all in all I'd say if you have the ingredients around it is worth making but if you have to make a trip to the store to make this I'd say it' probably not worth it.

Very good! Subbed carrots for squash and more yukon potatos instead of sweet potato.I didn't have a roasting pan so had to use the botton tray of a broiling pan covered w/ a sheet of aluminum foil. So the tips of the onions got burnt and I ended up lowering the temp between 425-450 degrees. I used half lemon juice, half balsamic vinegar. The veggies had a wonderful, fresh taste and beautiful appearance!

A vegan perspective. I modified this. Make sure you use fresh, not dried seasonings. House will smell awesome. I added some extra butternut squash and sweet patatoes which I later put it into a food processor with some seasonings and made soup using the seasonings from "Spiced Butternut Squash Soup" recipe on this website. In the soup I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream (I'm a vegan). The other vegetables in the roasting pan turned into awesome side dishes and and awesome potato salad with veganaise.

Very tasty and so easy....do NOT use dried spices, fresh are best for this recipe.  If you must use dried use about 1/3 the amount, be careful with them they will quickly overpower your veggies.

This is worth making just for the wonderful aroma it fills your house with. Like a previous reviewer, I added the peppers later, after 20 min. A very good recipe, one that's easy to modify just by switching up the veggies you use. And the leftovers make a delicious omelet!

This recipe is delicious! I use zucchini and carrots instead of squash. I put the onions, peppers and zucchini in at the last 15 minutes of cook time. I love the sweetness that comes from the sweet potatoes and carrots when cooked like this. I have made these vegetable twice in 2 weeks. Thanks.

This was great! I left out the red pepper (truth be told, I forgot to buy it) and roasted the veggies with my Thanksgiving Turkey Breast.  I also used the balsamic vinegar vegetable glaze on the turkey, and it all turned out amazing!

This Recipe is a very nice treat to any meal. I added a few carrots and zucchini. I also used lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar to add a little more flavor to the potatoes. i also used a little more potatoes just as a personal preference. To add even more flavor I even added some parmesan cheese which the guests really loved. This is a good basic recipe to experiment with as well...

This was OK but to get every thing cooked well some were burnt, some were mushy and some were just right.  I think you need to watch it closely and remove the veggies that are done to a warm serving platter tented with foil as the others finish cooking. This would allow the more firm veggies finish in the oven without over-cooking the more delicate veggies.  The flavor was good and the balsamic definitly added a great sweet and tangy flavor.  With those adjustments in mind I'll make again.

I made these tonight and they were good but not great. I think it was the thyme I disliked.  Good blend of vegetables but the thyme was to over bearing for my taste buds.  I used fresh rosemary and thyme. I like the vegetable blend but I had to alter the cooking time because my squash was done quicker than my potatoes.  I will make this again but will experiment with the spices.

Thank you....

We enjoyed this dish. I needed a larger pan, but it worked out okay. I had left overs so I made soup, a day or so later, and just added rotel tomatos with green chilis,ranch style beans,and a few other green veggies, and it was awesome. Can't lose when any extra can be extended to another meal! Thanks!

I followed another reviewer's advice and put the root vegetables in first.  After about 15 minutes, I added in the onion and peppers (and I added 4 peeled and halved cloves of garlic!) and cooked it for about 20 more minutes.

I wanted to serve this as a main dish, so after it came out of the oven, I stirred in about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of leftover jarred spaghetti sauce.  The sauce made it moist so we could eat it over rice.

Amazing recipe-- added 6 inch asparagus pieces and kept them towards the bottom of the baking dish so they wouldn't dry out, and used garlic salt after the cooking was done.  I loved that you can get red, orange, yellow, green, purple and white all in one dish!

Great recipe!  Although it takes some time to peel and cut up all the veggies, it's worth it.  Perfect combination of sweet and salty.  I used Sierra Gold potatoes b/c I couldn't find Yukon Golds and it worked out just fine.  Cooked for 40 minutes at 475 and it was perfect.  Potatoes had a nice texture, not too hard.  Be sure to stir every 10 minutes or onions will turn brown and crisp.  And fresh herbs really do make a difference!

This dish was allright. Very "herby", I would try it, but maybe decrease the amount of herbs.

I have made this several times now, and it is always a huge hit, even with the kids.  My only beef with the given recipe is the times indicated.  It takes me much longer than the 15 minute prep time (even if I only made one recipe's worth, which never happens!).  I was at a wedding recently and there was our favorite veggie dish (with the veggies cut in strips and steaks rather than cubes)!

I cooked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes and the vegetables were still raw.  I'll be lucky if my husband allows me in the kitchen again.  And the balsamic glaze is tasteless.

It was a very good recipe.Something different from just baked or mashed potatoes as a side-dish.I used baking potatoes instead of Yukon Gold and regreted it - that part turned out  to be too  bland and hardly cooked. And I also will use a bit more of the dressing for the vegetables next time.

I served this on New Year's Eve to our gourmet dinner club.  It was something different and made a beautiful presentation!  One thing I did change was that I marninated all the veggies overnight and it really flavored them.

Delicious!  This was easy to prepare and very tasty.  I will try this again and will experiment with additional vegetables.
Update: I've also used this recipe to roast the vegetables and then purée into a wonderful soup. It works out beautifully.

This is a fabulous recipe. I made these a few weeks ago and husband and son loved them. My vegetable mixture consisted of potatoes, red, yellow and orange sweet pepper chunks, and the red onion; the rest of the recipe was prepared as written. OUTSTANDING...and this recipe makes for a great, healthy snack as well!! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love using this recipe.  I add carrots and keep all the other vegetables including the sweet potatoes in the recipe.  I also add green pepper and  I chop fresh parsley and mix it in when the vegetables are done roasting.  It is scrumptious!

Excellent! Like some others suggested, I substituted carrots for the squash. I also used dried Thyme (only 1 teaspoon!) since I didn't have any fresh on hand. I read somewhere that when replacing fresh with dried only 1/3 the amount should be used and this has always worked out fine for me.

This is a great recipe.  I follow Weight Watchers Core plan so I'm always looking for zero point recipes.  I made this for Thanksgiving this year and have made it 3 mores times since.  I've shared it with my Weight Watchers class.

It may very well be my fault.  But neither I nor my family of 4 cared for these.  They went straight into the trash.  It could've been the vegetables in them we didn't care for.  We don't like sweet potatoes.  I will not be making them again.

Wow!  I don't like vegetables and I just couldn't stop picking off the plate before it got to the table!  Yep, I tried all of them!  As my British mom taught me, use melted shortining instead of the oil; it browns better.  The next day, I pureed the (few) leftovers and made a spread for toast rounds and *that* was great too!  I would never use dried herbs on this after really enjoying the fresh!  Thanks for "getting mommy to eat her veggies"!

Great recipe!  We eat roasted veggies often and this was the best we've had.  My only complaint - too many potatoes for my liking.  I used 1 sweet potatoe and 1 yukon gold; anything more would've been overkill.

This was an awesome dish!  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for five minutes to ensure they were done.   Used yellow squash instead of butternut and sliced everything instead of cubing.  Cooked it at home and transferred it to a roasting bag for a barbeque.  Threw it on the grill for five minutes...yummy.

I made this dish for a group of friends and thought I had made way too much.  Every bit was eaten with most people taking seconds.  I added various zucchini's and emulsified a jalapeno pepper with the oil & vinegar before coating the veggies.  This has now become one of my boyfriends favorite side dishes.  Thanks.

Yum! This was really good. It smelled wonderful coming out of the oven. I used the potatoes I already had (Russet, I think). I think you'll be fine if you decrease the amount of oil a just a bit. Also, use fresh thyme and rosemary if you can. The only thing is that peeling and chopping all the ingredients takes a very long time. It's all worth it though.

This will definitely be part of my best recipes for large groups or holidays.  The blend of flavors was perfect.  It was great!  I probably cooked it longer because I cooked it ahead and then heated it up again.  But it is very forgiving that way.  Excellent!

I made these veggies for my Bunko group and they were a huge hit!  Everyone couldn't get enough.  I added a little garlic and it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious!  Like the other reviewers said, this works with just about any vegetable you have lying around.  I used red potatoes instead of yukon gold;added a two carrots, 2 celery stalks and 1 leek.  Turned out very well--the extras helped even out the starchiness.  Used dried herbs and those worked fine; all though I can see how fresh herbs would make it even better.  Goes great with quinoa. Very simple to make; very delicious!

This recipe is amazing!!
I didnt have all the ingrediants listed, but used what i had to hand which was.
Baking potatoes x3,Small sweed x2
carrots x2 (wish i had more)
green pepper x1,leeks x 2.I didnt have balsamic vinegar so used white wine vinegar instead.I used dry herbs tyme and mixed.Also added one clove of garlic as i really like it.
I really think it doesnt matter what veg you use it will taste excellent no matter what.
Like to add that this taste just as gorgeous cold the nxt day as a snack.
Thank you so much for this simple yet lovely recipe.

I made this dish for Christmas.  I ended up sauteeing the veggies instead of roasting them (the oven door came off--don't ask).  I also like to add beets, so they've been given the nickname "Pink Veggies" at my house.

i used yellow squash and zuchini in this recipe and it turned out great. i also used a white onion instead of red. i didn't have fresh herbs so i used the ones in the bottle and they worked. i'm glad i listened to the other reviews about using less olive oil cause it does get oiley. a little goes a long way!

This gets everyone in the house to eat veggies!  I loved the sweet potatoes/yams the most!  However, I didn't like the zucchini or bell peppers because they became bitter after they were roasted!  That's perfectly fine though because you can use your favorite veggies to replace any other vegetable!

I have to say I was more than happy with this recipe. The only change I made was to put in new potatoes insted of the Yukon gold. I shall do this many a time I will experiment with a few ideas and get back to you all. 5*+

Absolutely the best food on the table this Thanksgiving (and it was all delicious!)  Delicious and healthy, too!  I think the fresh herbs made it special--and I loved the fragrance on my hands and in the kitchen.  Easy to fix a double recipe, reheated well--the hardest part  of the preparation was getting the peel off the squash.

I prepared it as directed but used dried herbs instead of fresh.  Turned out great.  I served this with the Awesome slow cooker pot roast and it made a great meal along with a salad.  Some people didn't like the squash too much so I might try carrots next time as others have suggested.

This was pretty good, just the rosemary was a bit too strong for my taste.  Also I think I will use carrots instead of squash next time as my husband didn't like the squash.  Very easy to make.  I'm sure I'll use this again.

Easy and Delicious! This one is a keeper that I can't wait to serve for company. After reading another review, I also used carrots instead of the squash because its a little quicker. I did not notice how much this made so I will scale down next time and we will be eating the leftovers tonight.

I was looking for a different way to serve roast veges for the family & decided to try this one. It was easy & delicious. My husband loved it & the kids did too! I used lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar & it was fine.

A favorite around here.  Especially when cooked on the grill.  On the george foreman grill works well too.

This was so good and easy.  As others suggested, I used things on hand such as carrots instead of squash and baking potatoes.  I didn't measure out the oil, vinegar and herbs, but this is so simple I don't think you could mess it up.  I used fresh rosemary, thyme, and dill from my garden.  Also, sprinkled it with coarse salt.

This is a great way to get your vegetables in.  The combination of flavors turns out really well.  Also, try adding a bit of red pepper for a little kick.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have any squash or sweet potato to include, but I did add carrots and celery.  It was great!  The fresh herbs and balsamic vinegar really add to the flavor.  I will be making this again and again.

Wonderful!  Delicious, impressive and easy side dish!  Served it tonight with this site's Chicken Cordon Bleu II.  Lovely meal!  Everyone raved about the roasted veggies.  Great aroma while cooking, too.  I will definitely make this again.

This was sooooo YUMMY!!!  I took the great adviceo of many other reviewers and used FRESH thyme.  I omitted the rosemary because my husband hates it; he says it's like eating pine needles.  Anyway, the fresh thyme was absolutely delicious.  I used acorn squash, onions, potatoes and fresh garlic cloves.  Next time I make this I want to try eggplant and zucchini too.  The balsamic vinegar gives these veggies this nicest sweet/tangy taste.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I'm not much of a vegetable fan, but this was outstanding. Added carrots as some other reviewers suggested and used white onions and baking taters because that's what we had on hand. They did fine.

I followed the recipe exactly (which I normally don't, usually I tweak it somehow) and it turned out fantastic! I served them at a dinner party and everyone asked me for the recipe. I might add carrots to it next time just for a change. S. Newson, BC

Excellent way to introduce more veggies to your diet. I used all of the above veggies and added carrots. I put all of my veggies (including potatoes) in the oven at the same time and it came out perfect.  When I tossed my veggies every 10 minutes I added a little more balsamic vinegar. Definitely agree that the balsmic vinegar and the fresh herbs make this recipe excellent.  ** Note - prep time is more than 15 minutes, there is a lot of chopping involved (but well worth the time!)

I made this dish for my husband's potluck at work because I wanted something different than the usual veggie side. He brought the dish home empty and said that everyone enjoyed it very much. Thanks.

This recipe has become part of our Thanksgiving fare.  This is the only way my family will eat squash. They love this and go back for seconds.  Fresh herbs are essential to this recipe.  Horrors! I was out of olive oil so I substituted it with walnut oil.  Wow!  Excellent!

I loved this recipe!!  I used 2 red potatoes and 1 sweet potato, asparagus, red onions, butternut squash, Pam Olive Oil Spray instead of real olive oil and a little of McCormick's Montreal Chicken Seasoning along w/ the fresh thyme and rosemary.  I baked the squash and potatoes in the oven first for about 20min. before mixing with the other veggies.   I omited the balsamic vinegar b/c I'm just not a big fan of it.   I will definitely make this again!

This is great! This is the second time i have made this.  The first time I didn't have balsamic vingar, but I had balsamic dressing. I did not add the potatoes either time. This time I only had an italian pesto dressing. I added that and it was great!  Thanks!

I customized the recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients it called for. I added cilantro and green onions diced instead of rosemary which gave it a great spanish flavor. I also added mushrooms, yellow peppers, garlic and I didn't have sweet potatoes in it. I had run out of balsamic vinegar so I used a little bit of red wine vinegar. Anyways this was very nice, my family loved it!

These were THE BEST vegetables I have ever had!!!  Even my 15 month old couldn't get enough!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cooked the potatoes (with a little of the sauce) for 10-15 minutes before I added the other veggies and the remainder of the sauce.  I added asparagus, mushrooms, and (for the last 10 minutes) grape tomatoes.  I will definitely make this recipe again!!

The taste and idea are good, but couldn't give it a higher rate because I am never successful at roasting vegetables. They always get stuck and I was a little disgusted by the dried rosemary. I didn't like having them in my mouth. Thanks

We love fresh vegetables, but this recipe just wasn't for us.  I will try again leaving out the sweet potatoes, vinegar, and use only 1/2 the oil called for replacing it with butter and add some garlic.  I probably will just grill it in a foil pouch instead of having to stir every 10 minutes.

I omitted the potatoes and added mushrooms, onions and red bell peppers. Yum. I also omitted the olive oil and sprayed with Pam instead to make the veggies low fat.  The Lipton Herbs and Garlic mix is excellent.

These were pretty good.  I liked the texture a lot.  I left out the yukon gold potatoes (I was also serving mashed potatoes), and instead used parsnips and sweet onion, in addition to the red onion.  I am SURE that I used more veggies than it called for, so next time I would add more seasoning.  I would definitely try this again, although it did take quite awhile to chop everything.  It was also a little bit of a pain to have to stir everything so often.

Excellent recipe!  I found that it works better if you cook the vegetables in different batches.  First, start with onions, bell peppers (I used red, orange, yellow peppers.  Looked really pretty), potatoes, and sweet potatoes.  After about 25 minutes, I added zucchini and asparagas.  This way, the latter vegetables don't get overcooked.  You can add other vegetables too, just make sure you time them so that they all get cooked perfectly.  The sweet potatoes are great in this recipe!

Yummy  These were great.  We added brussel sprouts and carrots to the mix and cut down on the potatoes.  We pre-cooked (about 15 minutes) the potatoes and the squash and added the rest of the veggies in a second dish.  Agreat way to get your veggies!

This is excellent.  If you are using dried spices, make sure you reduce the amount and it will turn out great!  We used russet potatoes and yellow peppers (out of red) and it was still great.  For my family, this would feed about 5 people as a side-dish.  Yum, yum.

Good mix of flavors - makes a ton of veggies!  Rosemary flavor was a bit strong and it needed it bit more "spice" - I might add a dash of cayenne next time.

Excellent. Vegetables were roasted to perfection and very favourful. Although I did add more onions and potatoes than stated. The scent coming from them was wonderful.

This was a good recipe. Next time I would cut down on rosemary (tto woody) but other than that the flavor was good. Will make again.

I did not care for this combination of vegetables.  I didn't use fresh herbs and that may have affected the flavor also.

I thought this recipe was OK.  I definately took me longer than the estimated 15 minutes to wash, peel and cut all of the vegetables.  I will make it again, but I think I will leave out the potatoes and add zucchini and mushrooms.

Very good!! I made these with pork chops, and it was really great. I didn't use all the same vegetables in the recipe, but I don't think it matters. It's all in the sauce. The only thing is, I put way too many potatoes and they were less flavourful than the rest. All in all, it was a beautiful dish, simple to make but included a lot of peeling and chopping. Everyone loved it =)

My husband really liked this but it wasn't my favorite (I think due to the spices). It was fairly easy to make except for a lot of chopping. I would make again because it is so different from the normal vegetables.

Thanks so much for a versatile recipe for winter veggies.  I used 2 sweet potatoes, 1 lb. small Yukon Golds, 1 red onion, and 1 sm. butternut squash.  This amount served 8 just fine.  It took 45 minutes for them to cook to the tenderness I prefer.  I did not separate the onion into pieces, but just cut it into thin wedges.  I used these to accompany orange-ginger pork tenderloin and steamed green beans.

I thought it tasted better sitting out at room temp rather than right out of the oven.  Husband thought there was plastic burning in the house while it was cooking.  Pretty in presentation but not what I was expecting.  I had to turn down the oven temp too after the first 20  min.  Used lemon juice instead of balsamic and very bland; had to add lots of salt & pepper.  Probably will not make again.  It was not a hit at our dinner party tonight.

I made this for my first ever family Christmas dinner, (the first one I got to host.) - Everyone loved it. I was so happy to find a new recipe to call "my own", which I could make along with the family's traditional recipes. There are a few vegetarians in the family and they were especially grateful to have such a special dish that tasted so fantastic. The only changes I made were that I couldn't find fresh herbs (I'll never grocery shop Dec 24th again!!!) - so I had to use dried. It didn't matter though - it tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant, and it was a beautiful dish too. I'll definitly be making this again. Thank you so much :)

We all loved this recipe!  Versions of this recipe using the vegetables that are hand are easy now that I know the basics, but the combination on veggies used was very tasty!  I liked how it can be baked before a meal and warmed up too!  Thanks!

Was making this for a club pot luck and it was gone in a flash. Everyone loved it.  Did substitute dried herbs for the fresh at one third the amount called for in the recipe. Many of you know that dried herbs are more potent, so one teaspoon of dried thyme and two teaspoons of dried rosemary works well. I've also added a pinch of dill and garlic powder, but Saundra's recipe is fantastic the way it stands. Have made it about six times.

I made the exact recipe except I substituted dried thyme and rosemary for fresh (using the same amounts indicated). It turned out delicious! My only warning is that the prep time took almost an hour. I could probably have saved 15 minutes if I bought pre-cut squash, as that took up a good chunk of the time.

This would be a fantastic side dish on Thanksgiving. Next time I think I will add one yellow bell pepper and one orange bell pepper for some beautiful color. I cooked at 475 degrees for 35 minutes and that seemed to be just the right amount of time. I did stir and flip the vegetables halfway through. The family really enjoyed this one!

I made these, and loved it, but they were not crisp and tender at the end of cooking time.  I was having company, so crisped them up in the air fryer for a few minutes, and they were outstanding.  I used red and yellow peppers, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, onions.  Delicious.  Four stars only because of the timing and need to use the air fryer, and also I used more seasoning.  Otherwise, perfect!

For me, this was good but not great. I followed the recipe exactly, other than reducing the temp to 450 vs 475 to keep it from burning. To me, it's missing a little something to make it great. The sweet potatoes in it gave it a bit of a sweetness but not enough to call it sweet. I thought it needed to be a bit sweeter or not sweet at all. I will make this again but maybe change up some of the vegetables.  Maybe that will do the trick for me. It's certainly a keeper though.

This was very good! I did add the veggies 10 min after the potatoes went in. I used asparagus instead of squash and carrot instead of a second bell pepper. Next time I would add the veggies in 15 minutes after the start time. Overall, very pleased with the flavor. Enjoyed the sweet potato! This will be the way I eat it from now on! I haven't liked sweet potatoes before now!

A classic recipe for winter vegetables.  I always use just enough oil to lightly coat the vegetables; this is actually less than one tablespoon, added by itself.  I check the vegetables for softness throughout the cooking time and if one vegetable is lagging behind I quickly cut them in half.  Also, at 475 the onions tend to burn so I add them a little bit later in the cooking process.  Fresh rosemary is a must for this recipe, and adding a whole bulb of peeled garlic is also nice.

SO flavorful and my family's favorite. I made this for the first time 11 years ago and I have never ever changed the recipe. It's such an elevated flavorful dish with the hardest thing being all the chopping and dicing. I always roll this out at the holidays and for potlucks and it's always a crowd pleaser.

I used the veggies I had on hand. Squash, zucchini, anaheim peppers, and poblano peppers and added the onion. I used all the spices and cooking times in this recipe. The result was amazing. I put them in the crock pot with some fajita meat, garlic, chicken broth and let it simmer. Made egg noodles after work and added some more garlic, mustard, pepper, jalapeños, and funny enough a bit of beer to it. The result well it's all gone.

So good!  As leftovers the next day too! So much flavour and really pretty too!I didn’t use peppers, just lots of root veggies.  After 40 minutes, they were done, but still with some form, kind of al dente!  Nothing was even close to mushy   Delicious!

I made this for me and my wife. I had to make a couple changes, but mostly stuck with the recipe. I put a tiny amount of rosemary, as my wife doesn't care for a very strong rosemary. I also completely left out the ginger, as my wife will not eat ginger, saying even in small amounts, that she doesn't like it. I believe the prep time to be off. I know I'm not the fastest chef around, but would love to meet the person who can peel and cut the Vegetables in less than 1½ hours. But with those things said, we absolutely loved it! The recipe is definitely for a large party, and we ate it for 3 meals. That is no worry though as I believe it's even better reheated! I believe I will fix it for Thanksgiving!

Absolutely delicious! I took several reviewers’ suggestions and added the more delicate veggies to the pan (in my case strips of red pepper and spears of asparagus) 12 minutes before the rest of the vegetables were finished roasting.

Flavor is good but I'm going to try a few different things. Either nuke the sweet potatoes & butternut squash or bake them 15-20 min before adding the other veggies or boiling them and baking them all together. I need to try something to get them all on the same baking time. Other than that, oil the pan very well to prevent sticking. I will definitely try again.

Big hit with everyone; I did use the fresh herbs - smelled sooooo good.  If  you use dry you definitely would have to cut back on the quantity of herbs.  Only thing I did differently was to add the onion, peppers, and Brussels sprouts (1 added veggie there; cut the Brussels sprouts in half) after the other root veggies roasted for the first twenty minutes, so everything had the right texture, tender not mushy.  I did add a bit more salt after roasting to my liking.

Decreased oven temperature to 425 degrees as the recommended temperature of 475 degrees will burn the vegetables even if you stir them every 10 minutes. Turned out great!

Everyone loved it! I did cover it with foil when baking for the first 30 minutes. I used only what veggies I had on-hand - russets, sweet potatoes (these added A LOT!), fresh green beans, baby carrots, spring onions, and red onions. It was perfect, but could’ve been really even other veggies and delicious.

This recipe came out PERFECT.  I followed the recipe as is; however, I took the advice of another reviewer and sprayed the pan with nonstick cooking spray first and covered vegetables for 20 min. and then baked uncovered for the remaining 20 min.

I have never had squash before but I would definitely have it again cooked this way. I used the parchment paper and had no issues with anything sticking. Next time I will use less olive oil but the balsamic flavor with the fresh herbs was excellent.

I freaking LOVE this. Allowing the veggies to caramelize the way that they do in the oven brings out their sweetness. Hands down a new fav of mine and I will be making this often!

Whatever veggies you use the sauce is fantastic. Just adjust the time for the veggies you are using.

As is, I thought it could use a little more balsalmic vinegar.  I added it until I could see it on all of the vegetables.  It was so good and then I added some sliced turkey sausage on top of that.  Yum!  Will make again.

It turned out amazing! You can really substitute any veggies in. Add some cayenne for some extra kick.

My veggies: zucchini, bell peppers, cauliflower (this came out surprisingly good), mushrooms, and eggplant.

I love this recipe and make it quite often.  I have changed out the vegetables based on our preferences.  We use carrots, red potatoes, red onion and red bell pepper.  Use the same spices and seasonings and follow the recipe as written.  Loved by everyone who tries this!

Excellent, but I made some changes:  I used convection oven at 400.  Ingredients were Brussels sprouts, pepper, 1 corn cut into 4ths; green beans, mushroom, 1 red potato, and 1 red onion.  Once cut up I added all in bag with olive oil; then dumped into a 9x13 glass pan.  To that I Added herb du province, salt, pepper, oregano, rosemary; then balsamic.  Cooked for 30 min, then covered with foil for another 20.  Added a handful of chapped parsley and turned the oven off and left it while making salmon with teriyaki on the stove for about 15 minutes.  Came out awesome!

This recipe was easy to make and flavorful.  Everyone in the (extended) family enjoyed it, including the 14-year-old!  I didn't have access to the fresh herbs, so I reduced the amount to about 2 teaspoons of each.

This is the first time I roasted vegetables like this and it was spectacular. It look like a lot for three people at first but when they were cooked we ate them all. It’s a great way to get kids to eat their veggies. I added some baby carrots and whatever other vegetables and wanted to throw in there. I didn’t have any squash so I just went with the potato and the sweet potato and the rest were onions and peppers and mushrooms.  It was great I would highly recommend this recipe.

Substituted lemon juice for vinegar, used white onion and red potatoes. Didn't have a squash, so left it out, but I did add a stalk of celery and some carrot. Turned out absolutely DIVINE!! Will be having this often.

I made this last night. In my opinion, a lower oven temp. would have been a big improvement. Found another recipe for roasted vegetables and it suggested a 375 oven temp. That is what I will go with next time.

Delicious easy vegan option.  Great flavor. Even my teenage boys loved it.  I followed the recipe as is for 12 servings (entree for 5 people) and there weren’t any leftovers.  I added baked chicken strips for meat eaters to add.

Used balsamic glaze and a bit of red wine vinegar as I had no balsamic vinegar. I used a combination of red baby potatoes and Yukon Gold. I added a carrot. I also used dried thyme because I didn't have fresh. It's a recipe that you can easily adapt to what you have on hand.

Made this last night and we really enjoyed the recipe.  Made no real changes to the recipes but as others suggested I started the roasting of the potatoes (sweet potatoes/yellow potatoes) 10 minutes early to ensure they would be cooked through, and then mixed them in with the additional ingredients and continued roasting for the recommended time.  Easy instructions to follow and very flavorful.

I will definitely make this again.  It was easy and very tasty.  I made some changes the 2nd and 3rd times I made this in that I threw in yams, string beans, and mushrooms.  The yams and mushrooms were amazingly good.  Because I added extra, I'll put in more balsamic next time; the extra ingredients took a bit of zing out of the original recipe.

The balsamic made them all look brown and unappetizing, especially the potatoes, which was unfortunate as I was serving them to company. I added some other veggies like Brussels sprouts and carrots which was nice. I had to add quite a bit of salt at the end to balance the vinegar taste. Nobody was really that excited about this dish. Won’t be making this again.

This was so delicious!! I used the veggies I had at home (baby carrots, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and crimini mushrooms).  I cooked the slower cooking veggies (Brussels sprouts, carrots, broccoli) on one baking tray for approx. 35 mins., and the other veggies on another tray for approx. 15 mins. I also added some garlic powder. 

I'm not a huge fan of balsamic vinegar and was worried the taste would be strong, but the flavor at the end was the aromatic fresh herbs - YUM!

This will be delicious for our holiday dinner tonight! I added a green bell pepper and cooked some zucchini rounds on another pan for less time (only took 10 minutes). I didn’t have the thyme, so I used a little more rosemary. I used just a tad bit more olive oil and balsamic vinegar because I probably had more vegetables than the recipe. I used small red new potatoes cut in half rather than the Yukon Gold.

I substituted all the fresh herbs with a third of what the recipe called for with dry herbs. Though, I think I could've gone stronger even! So maybe next time I'll half them instead. I didn't really taste much of the balsamic vinegar; just salt & pepper, really. But they came out good and healthy! A good enough dinner for me with a bunch of yummy veggies!

The flavor was good but as others have stated the bellpeppers and onion get too soggy before the rest are cooked. Next time I’ll wait for the last 20 mins of cooking time and add the onion and peppers.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used a few more small potatoes and some cauliflower instead of the butternut squash and it was delicious. The recipe of 12 servings was about right for 7 adults who like vegetables!

Loved the dish. I added chef carrots and all the other ingredients mixed well when I put them in a 6 qt pot with cover and shook everything up to get the oil, balsamic vinegar, etc. on the vegetables. Makes a great dish for Thanksgiving since it has the Fall colors throughout.

I used dried herbs and ground them by hand was the only change, I would definitely like to make again with fresh herbs. I was looking for a recipe to use butternut squash and is an excellent fall dish It is also a good recipe if you like to improvise. I have made this many times.

The flavour was nice, but I found that certain veggies are done before others , therefore some things were mushy.  I made it a second time but this time I separated the veggies,  I used two cookie sheets and spread them out. e.g. potatoes and squash together because they took about the same time.  I used carrots and beets. beets took the longest time.  Pepper's the least.  That way I could keep an eye on them and remove them separately as they were done.

Made this to go with Barbecued Pork Kebabs last night.  It was so good.  Changes I made were using dried thyme and rosemary (trick is to use half the amount for dried as the flavor is more concentrated), and I used a pkg of little rainbow potatoes instead of Yukon Gold, which really added to the color variety with the butternut squash and sweet potato.  We will definitely make this again.

This was a big hit.  I did as some others suggested and cooked the root veggies separately.  I put those in the oven for 20 minutes at 475.  Then I brought the temp down to 425.  I have a double oven, so I put the other veggies in the other oven at 475 and cooked them all for another 20 minutes.

I added mushrooms, zucchini, and asparagus.  Everything else  I kept the same.  Everyone, even my husband who only eats potatoes, liked it.

This is an outstanding recipe.  Made it using all the ingredients listed, minus the bell pepper and sweet potato, didn't have either, and added some zucchini.  The flavors are wonderful.  I was a little doubtful about the balsamic vinegar, but it added a subtle depth of flavor along with the rosemary that really makes these vegetables stand out.  Mine was done in 35 minutes.   I will definitely make this again.. Thanks for sharing this!

I had baking potatoes and mushrooms to use up. Kiddies suggested red pepper, zucchini, and butternut squash.  I guesstimated the amount of basalmic and oil and herbs. It turned out great for my household of men.  I do recommend fresh butternut squash and use the microwave to soften it a bit before cubing.

Awesome recipe! I did not have any balsamic vinegar but I used garlic ali. I used Yukon gold potatoes with baby carrots first as they take longer and added other veggies later. The thyme and rosemary make a wonderful flavour. Don’t be scared if the veggies turn a bit black. They are soooo yummy when the carmelize.

I didn't use fresh spices, balsamic vinegar. I substituted some of the veggies. I used dry spices, I added garlic and I used red wine vinegar instead. I put mushrooms, green pepper, russet potatoes, yellow squash, yellow onion, broccoli, cherry tomatoes and it still turned out wonderful! I also baked it for an hour instead of the 35 min's since using regular potatoes.

Substituted Brussels sprouts for the white potatoes. Other than that, followed the instructions to the letter and it turned out great. Was tempted to add some more oil and balsamic, but there was plenty to coat the veggies. Very colorful and healthy dish!

I lobe this recipe however I don’t care for the herbs.  I replaced the gold potatoes with some zucchini and thick stalked asparagus since I’m watching my carbs.  I only cooked for 20 min since I like my veggies on the crunchier tender side

These veggies were good but I only had dried thyme and rosemary on hand so maybe it'd taste better with fresh as per the recipe.  We had to add more balsamic (maybe ours is old?) and seasonings than what was called for and we still didn't quite catch much balsamic flavor so will definitely either marinade in the combo or add more or both.  We had a lot of veggies but we had also compensated for that by adding more balsamic, seasonings, etc.  Overall, we'll likely make them again though, we all enjoyed them.

Delicious. I use this recipe all the time now. I often put eggplant instead of squash. Sometimes I roast the vegetables separately so that I can cook them each to perfection before mixing them together. I think dried herbs work fine too, just use a little less than the fresh herb suggestion.

I followed this to a T. I thought it was way too high of a temp and too many herbs, but I followed it anyways.  Big Mistake! Olive oil has such a low burning  point that basically everything burnt. 

Pro Tip: Use less olive oil and less herbs and try to cook at a much lower temp.

I loved this! I did make some changes/additions that worked perfectly. In total all the veggies I used was the butternut squash, red onion, sweet potatoes, golden potatoes, red bell pepper, and zucchini. I own the KitchenAid food processor attachment and I used it to dice every vegetable to the same size. I feel like using fresh thyme and rosemary was also very necessary. This worked perfect in the oven at 450 for 25-30 minutes. Nothing was overdone and nothing was underdone. Will definitely make it like this again. I liked having everything the same small size because you could get all the veggies in with one bite.

Yummy and super-easy, a hit at all the holiday parties. I thought a whole red onion would be too much, but by the end of the roasting process it's just right. Give yourself a few minutes extra in case the squash and yams (which I used instead of sweet potatoes) aren't quite done at 40 minutes. I added chunks of Granny Smith apple. They are pretty well stewed by 40 minutes but add a nice bit of sweet. If you want them firmer, throw them in half-way through.

I added some Brussels sprouts as this was for Xmas Day dinner. I made the olive oil/balsamic/herb dressing plus added 2 garlic cloves + 3 Tbsps of turkey drippings from the pan the night before.  The next morning I prepared the veggies in a bowl & tossed them with the dressing. I let them sit for a few hours marinading & then roasted them. They were incredibly delicious, the best roast veggies I've ever made. So delicious.

This is a great way to prepare vegetables!  This is my 3rd time making this recipe and it just seems to get better!  I read through several of the reviews and have made changes of my own, many based on great suggestions.  The potatoes really don't add much so I left them out.  I added (more) carrots, (might add broccoli and/or cauliflower next time), added yellow and as well as red peppers, cooked hard and soft vegies separately (which worked MUCH better)  and DEFINITELY added cherry tomatoes 15 minutes before done!  Got rave reviews!

Despite what another reviewer said, I made this using dried thyme and rosemary instead of fresh and it turned out really well! The rule of thumb is to use 1/3 the amount when you are substituting because dried herbs are stronger than fresh. I didn't have any red peppers so I used carrots instead and I didn't have a red onion so I used a yellow onion instead. Also, my sweet potato was huge so I used the whole thing and omitted the yukon gold potatoes. I roasted everything together for the same amount of time on two cookie sheets--one on the top rack and one on the bottom but both near the middle of the oven. I stirred only once. YUM.

Delicious! I tweaked the recipe according to the recommendations I read. Instead of using butternut squash, I substituted zucchini and carrots. And I roasted the onion, carrots, yam and potatoes first for 30 minutes then added the zucchini+pepper second, roasting for an additional 10-15 minutes. Very important to use a nonstick roasting pan - I made the vegetables a second time using a glass Pyrex dish and it was messy/sticky and it didn't come out as well. Great recipe!

Awesome! Doubled the sauce and substituted fresh parsley vs rosemary. Cook until the veggies are browned and even black in certain spots.

I really liked it. I didn't put any squash in there. Only white potatoes, sweet potates, yellow bell pepper and broccoli. As well as all the spices and fresh herbs, oil and balsamic vinegar. 
We ate it as a main meal but it would make a fabulous side dish with beef, meatloaf, or cubes.
Will do it again.

I changed up the vegetables a lot, so I can't entirely blame it on the recipe, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like this flavor on just about anything. It was the vinegar that did it for me--but that might just be me. I guess I assumed you wouldn't be able to taste it as much, or that it'd change through the cooking, but it didn't.

We enjoyed the flavors of this recipe, although I do think that the potatoes, sweet potato and squash were all a bit..repetitive. Dominant flavor was definitely the rosemary; the squash and the sweet potato also added a lot of sweetness. This tasted much better right out of the oven; I would eat it the next day but wouldn't serve it to company on the second day.

 I definitely used more than 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar- maybe closer to three. We probably didn't need to chop the veggies up as much as we did. It too forever to prepare everything! Used aluminum foil, which worked well but should've sprayed the foil as some of the veggies ended up sticking to the sheet and there was some burning. I also forgot to stir the veggies...

--Since I personally do not like too much white potato in the recipe, I  decided to eliminate the Yukon potatoes, and instead, added two fresh cubed beets and one yam. I also used 2 red onion and 3 red bell pepper. The extra red pepper, red onion, beets, and yam to this recipe caramelize well during the roasting process adding extra yummy sweetness! Also, since I didn't have access to fresh herbs, I used 2 Tblsp of dried Italian seasoning instead.

Yum! Great base recipe to play with. I used eggplant, zucc, red onion, sweet potato and a couple red potatoes that needed to get used. Made this up to mix in with some quinoa and goat cheese...maybe add some chicken too. But would be great on a salad and/or just as a side. This is a rad recipe. Thanks!

Turned out great! I used zucchini and carrots instead of the squash  like someone else suggested. In retrospect, I would've separated the roots from the other vegetable to keep them from getting mushy. My girlfriend loved them!

I made it with yellow and red peppers, onions, asparagus and zucchini, omitting the potatoes. I didn't have thyme, so instead used a little dried basil and fresh parsley with the fresh rosemary.   I overcooked the veggies, but they were delicious anyway.  If omitting potatoes, 20-25 minutes is perfect.

I made this for a gathering.  Everyone loved it. I made two pans: one with root veggies including the potatoes and butternut squash and carrots, and one pan with asparagus, red bell pepper, onion, mushrooms and zucchini. I roasted the root veggies about 20 minutes longer. And I used rosemary infused olive oil and half the rosemary. Will definitely make again. ??

Yes, indeed this recipe earned all five stars! It's adaptable and oh so delicious. Appreciate the suggestion to use parchment paper, makes clean up so easy! Here's a tip: McCormick's Italian herb grinder. Next best thing if you don't have fresh herbs.

These are wonderful!:) Super delicious and feel free to add some cayenne for delicious zing.
I made this recipe twice.  The first time I was not impressed and the second time I doubled the amount of oil and stirred more frequently every 8 minutes not 10 as the recipe calls for.

I added some yellow squash, cracked red pepper, and at the end I topped it with some fresh Parmesan and broiled it for a few minutes.  Very delicious. I think it should be called vegan delight!

Very good!  Wasn't sure about how the overall taste would be due to the sweet potatoes but they add a nice, different, counter balance to the overall roasted garlic flavor.  A good break from the traditional roasted vegetables.  Have added to my repertoire.

New to the app and this was the first meal I added to my weekly prep. I really enjoyed the dish but the prep time for all the ingredients took me some time to prep. I would definitely make this dish again but I'd cut out the squash and add more peppers and onions. Thank you for the video because it helped me a great deal. I'm a visual learner.

This came out fantastic! I used brussel sprouts, 1 medium sweet potato - diced small, one butternut squash, a red & yellow pepper and a red onion. It is light and flavorful!! Will definitely make again and serve as a side dish at dinner. This batch was for me :)

Hard to get my family to eat butternut squash. This recipe did the trick. I substituted the sweet potato for red potato and added garlic powder. I even forgot to add the balsamic, but it was still delicious and we didn't have any leftovers. Litterally, 3 out of the 5 of us aren't vegetable eaters and no one picked anything out. During the last 5 minutes of baking I added from zen corn to make it more colorful.

Delicious and so savory!  The balsamic is a great addition.  I tweaked the herbs and veggies a bit to use up what I had on hand but I think this recipe would work with any combo that you like.

Healthy but overpowering. I won't make this exact recipe again. The veggies were awesome, but the spices were too much. Maybe if you halved the spices it would be good, but I think there are better roasted veggie recipes out there.

This was so yummy! You can adjust this with the herbs and/or veggies that you like. It is so delicious and hearty. I used 1 carrot, 1 sweet potato instead of the Yukon golds, 1 yam, 1 zucchini, 2 bell peppers and 1 red onion. Plus, I used dried herbs instead of fresh, still yummy. I took the advice of another reviewer and added the zucchini, peppers and onion in the last 10 minutes of the cook time. Perfect. I also made another recipe from this site to go with it and what a combo! http://allrecipes.com/recipe/221054/prosciutto-wrapped-cherry-stuffed-chicken-breasts/

I made this as instructions, but I roasted in a convention oven at 425 for 20 minutes, which gave it a little crunch.  I used corse salt and fresh herbs.  So delish.

My husband, who despises vegetables, LOVED this!  I julienned the veggies instead of cubing (since I just bought a new mandoline and wanted to try it).  I eliminated the salt, and added a bit og garlic and it was incredible.  I will absolutely make this again.  Thanks!

I have to start by saying I am not much of a vegetable eater.   Sure if they are there I MIGHT eat them.   But they are not gonna be my first choice when I'm cooking or go out to a restaurant.   That being said... These were the best tasting vegetables I have ever eaten in life.    I loved them.   I will probably make them on a weekly basis.  I am not a fan of squash so I left that out and added zucchini and baby carrots.   They were delicious.  Following this recipe I can officially say I enjoy eating vegetables!!!!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe except that I added some extra vegetables.  I added mushrooms, broccoli and zucchini.  I will be making this regularly.  The only thing I'll do differently is wait until the mixture has cooked partway before adding in the zucchini because it got too mushy adding it at the beginning.  Since it wasn't in the original recipe, that was my fault.

I didn't follow the instructions on using FRESH rosemary and thyme.  Big mistake.  The dried rosemary and thyme definitely didn't work.  Had I followed the instructions it would have been perfect.  That's why I still give it 4 stars- because it was my mistake.

This is a great way to get your veggie servings for the day all in one pan. I knocked the oven temp to 450 and then down to 425 after 20 minutes. This will definitely go into my regular rotation.

The sweet potato was very difficult to cut (I almost needed a hammer)! But, the remaining veggies were quick and easy to slice, and the recipe was delicious!

I made this for Christmas dinner instead of the usual mashed potatoes and gravy. Every one loved them. I didn't have squash so I used extra sweet potatoes but followed the recipe amounts and directions as written. Even my mom who doesn't like to try new things loved this!

I followed the receipe but when I make it again, I will put much less rosemary as I found the taste of rosemary overpowering.  Other than that, I think it would be delicious.

I did this a side dish and only used the squash and sweet potato I had on hand. It was delicious!!! I quite often bake vegetables in the oven with olive oil and some spices. But the addition of the Balsamic vinegar was amazing and will be adding it from now on! It's like candied veggies!!!

Turned out really good.  I used dried thyme  and was going to use dried rosemary which I'm glad I didn't. Luckily I decided to cut potatoes in small cube so everything turned out good. I would make it again

This worked out beautifully.  I love that you can prepare and cook this the day ahead and then warm it.  The only thing I'd do differently is add the onions when I warm it the next day.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I left out the potatoes, as I was serving mashed.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Never thought vegies would be the hit of the party.  The balsamic is very subtle and I only baked for 40 minutes.  Will add this to the play list.

I needed to add a healthy option to our holiday table. This was a big hit. Lots of prep work. Preplan about 30 casual minutes before roasting. Delicious and perfect for fall and winter.

It seems like a lot of work. If you are good with a knife and don't mind dealing with the fresh herbs it might be worth all the work.  The dish has a lot of flavor, but I gauge how much work with taste and this dish is good flavor, but A LOT of chopping.

This was a very tasty dish. I substituted carrots for the squash since that's what we had. It worked well. Next time I make this, I'd follow other reviewers' suggestion to put the potatoes in first, as they took longer to cook than the other veggies.

Substituted carrots, mushrooms, and grape tomatoes for the squash and sweet potatoes; otherwise made as directed.  I did roast for longer than indicated because I like my veggies softer. Tasty!

Fantastic recipe! I doubled it to serve 20 people. The fresh herbs added such wonderful flavor. Then I added 2 tablespoons of honey! This allowed the liquid to evenly coat all the veggies, and added just a touch of sweetness.

Now I know why they say to use fresh Rosemary, the dried were like little twigs. Since I used jared herbs I cut way back on the amounts. The veggies were still very good. I  had to cook them longer as I was using convection. Next time I would use my gas oven. It's just that it heat up the house too much. I would add the bell pepper and zucchini in the last 30 min. next time.

My family this recipe a lot!  Even my little one ate the onions, something he usually steers clear of.  This is the recipe I introduced butternut squash to my family in and everyone really likes it now.

The idea is great, but the veggies came out bland. I did use the recipe as directed. Maybe in the future I would add garlic and some other spices.

omg this is the best recipe EVER. Seriously. I'm supposed to be eating paleo, but I refuse to exclude this from my life! I didn't have the squash it called for. So, I just used sweet potatoes and red potatoes. The highlight of it is the flavor profile. Especially with the onions and balsamic vinegar. This is super good.

Oven roasted vegetables are great! In order to use up what I had on hand, I subbed sweet onion for red onion, green pepper for red pepper, mushrooms for squash, and dried herbs for fresh.  I omitted the balsamic vinegar and added three cloves of garlic. I plan to use squash and balsamic vinegar in my next veggie roast.

A really healthful recipe cannot be any easier! You can even add any of your firm leftover vegetables to the seasonal veges part way through cooking. By using any veges you happen to have, makes this a very inexpensive recipe. I stirred in the fresh chopped herbs just before I took it out of the oven to keep it looking and tasting fresh..

I unintentionally made changes on this recipe when my Wifi went down.  So I put in waaaaaay too much teryaki sauce.  but it was still good.  It didn't seem to teryaki-y or salty so maybe i would have said it needed more seasoning without that much sauce.  I guess i'll try the posted way and see what happens.

My husband couldn't stop eating. It truly was so very good! As recommended by others, I did use fresh rosemary and thyme and covered the dish for the first half of the time in the oven. Will be a regular on our menu.

Loved this very flexible way to cook veg. I was able to cook potatoes, tomatoes, and zucchini in the same dish. I simply added the zucchini and tomatoes about 10 minutes into the cooking time, and everything came out great. Marinade the way you want, season to taste, cook the root veggies and onions longer than those that require less cooking, everything comes out tasting great!

It's been well over an hour and the root vegetables aren't  cooked and the onion has burnt. I don't taste much flavor either, but I used dried spices to save money. All together, including prep it took me about 2  hours.

I used the veggies that I had on hand, which were sweet potatoes, gold potatoes, yellow squash and red pepper. Otherwise I followed the recipe and found it wonderful. It heats up fairly well the next day, which is good for us since we love leftovers. I will definitely make it again.

This turned out to be a pretty good side dish and it looked just like the picture in the end. Was easy-breezy to make and the kids liked it. I went a little heavier on the oil than the recipe recommended but I shouldn't have because a little went a long way to coating the veggies and helping the herbs stick. It wasn't bad, but next time I'll stick to the recipe quantity.

This was very good.  I changed up the vegetables some - omitted butternut squash and added broccoli and cauliflower.  As a result, I think either the oven was too hot or the roast time was too long because the broccoli and cauliflower were VERY roasted.  I did wind up turning down the oven temperature and roasting them not quite as long.  But the flavor was good and the rosemary and thyme were nice herb additions to the vegetables.  Would definitely make again.

I roasted the root veggies for 25 min first because I like my veggies done, not crunchy. then I added the other vegetables and baked another 25 min. and it is wonderful I shared with my neighbor and my daughter and they love it...Thank you.

This was so easy and tasted great!  I will make this again, and it is very versatile.  I used all different veggies - just whatever I had that would go well together.  Didn't have fresh thyme and rosemary so I reduced the amount by at least half and used dry instead.  Another reviewer wasn't happy with the results when using dry, but probably did not reduce the amount?

I didn't add the onions or butternut squash, just because I wanted to use up what was in the fridge. I added zucchinis instead. The fresh herbs are what I loved the most about this recipe, the balsamic gave it a little tang but not over the top. Definitely will make again :-)

I'm usually one that always adds to the recipes to make it my own.  It wasn't necessary with this dish. I added the ingredients exactly as instructed. My only add on was putting seasoned chicken breast on top of the veggies since I'm lazy and didn't want to add more pots to clean. Soooooooo good.  I have no complaints and will be making this dish a lot.

Yumm!! Great change from the regular boring side dishes, and it's quick prep too. I just started it 20 minutes before the meat went in the oven, then turned the temp down by 50 degrees; prepared as directed, except I used dry herbs (1 tsp ea) and it was great! This one is going into the rotation.

I followed another reviewer's advice to
375  or 400 instead of 475.
add one piece of garlic.
nonstick roasting pan.
 separate out the zucchini and bell peppers, adding about 20 minutes before it was finished. 
I also marinated all the veggies for about an hour before roasting, made for excellent flavor!

This is in my regular rotation now -- no matter the season and appropriate vegetables, it never fails.  I've done both dry and fresh herbs and there is an ever so slight difference, though both are excellent.

I thought this recipe has a great combination of vegetables. I made this for a party and should of doubled the recipe. I have already forwarded the recipe to my sister. I would recommend using fresh Thyme, etc. Using dry will over power the vegetables. All and all, it was delicious!

Perfect amount of oil, vinegar and seasonings! Only change I made was to slice the onions fairly thin. They caramelized nicely.

This is excellent and very easy to make. Though like others, I do separate the "softer" vegetables out and cook them in another pan for less time.

Simple and delicious, even without the balsamic. I made it with the vegetables I had on hand - 2 sweet potatoes, yellow onion, eggplant, carrot. The carrot was so-so, but the others were delish.

It was an absolute delight to prepare, and EAT this dish! I don't have an oven, therefore I tried it on the stove, and it was finger lickin'! The sweet and savory with the fuse of aromatic spices makes this dish an excellent getaway for Wintery evenings!

This was delicious and the ratio is perfect!  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes since that was all there was at the grocery store, and it worked well!

I used basil instead of thyme because I didn't have thyme and used italian squash instead of butternut squash for same reason.   very nice combination of flavors!   will do it on the barbecue next time to see if it comes out the same.

Definitley going to be a staple in my house. I put the potatoes in 15 minutes prior to everything else and use italian seasoning and garlic and oil, at 425 so the potatoes didnt dry out. the butternut squash was amazing with goat cheese!

I used Olive Oil, Balsamic, sage and thyme (dried not fresh), sea salt and a sprinkling of brown sugar for the glaze.  Veggies included: red potato, yellow potato, sweet potato, butternut squash, carrots, beets, onions and a few cloves of garlic.  Only needed 30 min at 450. Delish!

This dish was delicious and superbly  accompanied our autumn dinner. I used what we had on hand, which included 1/4 chopped white onion and only 3/4 of the quartered red onion. I had  gourmet maple infused balsamic but only dried herbs. Yet it really hit the mark. I can't wait to try it with fresh thyme and rosemary. This will be a winter go-to side dish.

Because I used dried Thyme and Rosemary instead of freshly chopped, I decreased the amount of each by about a third. After I pulled the veggies from the oven I thought it tasted just "okay," so I added some garlic salt and I thought that made it way better. If I make this again I will definitely use more potatoes and peppers; they were the most flavorful part.

I've been making vegetables this way for years.  I tried this recipe without the vinegar and it was great.  I cooked it at 450 for half hour without mixing though.  For those that want to use dry herbs, you can, but you need to cut the amounts in half as dry herbs are much more potent than fresh and probably why recipes were ruined for those trying dry.

4 stars, however, I do wish it was even more favorable for the amount of the work to prepare. I  will try to purchase pre-cut veggies, should I make this recipe, again.

I used LDITTY's suggestion and used zucchini and carrot cooking the root veggies first then adding the softer veggies for even roasting throughout. Excellent recipe have made it several times and always a hit!

I made this as is at first, except I used zucchini and yellow squash instead of the squash it calls for.  It was good at first but I was not a fan of the white potatoes the next days for left overs.  I made again using two sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes.  My preference, but I thought the dish held up well.  Just a note, the more tender vegetables tend to get burnt on the ends if you do not stir the vegetables up periodically while they are roasting.  My fiancé wasn't a fan, but he doesn't like sweet potatoes.  More for me and my 6-year old.

This recipe was delicious! I made a few mods. I didn't have freh rosemary so I used Oregano and dried rosemary. I added sweet baby tomatoes and carrots. The onions were especially yummy, so I'd recommend tossing in extra if you love onion like myself.

I made it just as the recipe says, and I love it! I also made this is a slow cooker. While it was much softer and less roasted, it was great in the slow cooker as well!

I used one of each: squash, zucchini, red onion, green pepper.  I also roasted two large roma tomatoes. At the end, I sliced the tomatoes and added a jar of roasted red peppers. I also used dried herb, 1tsp dried per 1T fresh. It turned out pretty great!  I did not use any potatoes or other squash as my intention for this recipe is to put the veggies on a sandwich bun with a few slices of brie and lettuce tomorrow for lunch. I tossed the veggies every 10 min for 35-37 minutes.

This was pretty good. I've made it twice now. I didn't feel the butternut squash made any difference in flavor. Second time I made it with chopped yellow squash instead and made a huge difference. The red peppers don't do much for it (taste-wise) as well. I still add them because they are healthy but if you want to save money, don't bother. The potatoes take longer to cook than everything else so I cook it for 10 min longer than suggested (50 min) and toss the veggies while cooking every 6-8 minute because the onions burn easily. All in all its a good veggie side and will make it again.

I used dried herbs and the taste of the herbs was overwhelming.  I will try the recipe again and add the herbs as I cook it in the pan to see if I yield better results.

Our new family favorite! We switch the veggies up often, but this is a classic must have!  We often use brussels sprouts and even broccoli and with the mix of sweet potatoes. Our favorite mail to serve this with is pesto Salmon.

One of my favorites.  It takes a little time to do the cutting but the finished product is worth it.  Perfect side with veggies and potatoes.

I followed greeny4444's hints on temps and cooking times.  So delicious!  I used what I had on hand...one parsnip, two sweet potatoes, one red onion, one red pepper, two zucchini and four handfuls of baby carrots.  I put the root veggies in a baggie with the sauce and shook them to coat before putting on the cookie sheet.  I did make up another smaller version of the sauce for the pepper and zucchini.  So good!

This recipe was perfect. I used the lemon juice instead of the balsamic vinegar (as the author suggests) and it was a perfect balance of acid with the olive oil and fresh herbs. It was just perfect. I would make this over and over again, especially given the ease of finding pre-cubed butternut squash in the grocery store.

I had to use dried herbs, so I cut the amount to 1/3. I also prepared everything ahead of time and marinated the vegetables in the fridge for a couple of hours.  After cooking, the herbs were too strong.  Lacking fresh herbs, I would just go with garlic salt and leave out the Rosemary and thyme.

Excellent side dish!!! I couldn't stop eating them as I was taking my trays out of the oven. A definite keeper! I did follow the suggestions for the delicate veggies if putting them on a separate tray since they cook faster. Thanks

This is what people ask me to bring to holiday dinners every year. It takes a while to prep the vegetables, so I do that the day before roasting, or roast one day and reheat the next day to serve. It's a fantastic blend of flavors. Sometimes I've omitted certain ingredients but it's really not as good unless I follow the recipe exactly. 

I like to make this recipe at the beginning of the week and heat it up over cooked brown rice as my lunch. It's quite filling.

This recipe was awesome. Not sure what makes it so good maybe the balsamic? The only change I would make is to add a bit more red onion.

GREAT recipe.  Kept everything as is, except that I used dried rosemary and thyme because that's what I had.  I cut those back a little to balance out the change.  Delicious, healthy, colorful and easy to make.  Will definitely make it again.

Super easy.  One of those recipes that you can do slight changes to each week and it never gets boring. (Changes such as different veggies, with or without potatoes, balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, sprinkle feta cheese or parmesan cheese, or no cheese on top before serving, etc.). Remember to adjust cooking time accordingly.  This recipe is for 12 servings - more like 24!  I cut it to 2 servings and had plenty.  For those who complain about the amount of chopping: I used pre-cut veggies from store.  And, as I chopped up mushrooms, red pepper, etc I kept small amounts aside and used them for our dinner salads.  Thanks!

I cooked this in a deep ceramic baking dish, which made them softer rather than caramelized, and it was delicious.  My husband claims to dislike several of the veggies used in this dish, but, since I didn't tell him the ingredients beforehand, he ate it up, none the wiser! ;)

changed the veggies to what i had in the fridge.i was a little worried as it cooked and i checked on it. the basalmic vinegar smell was very strong(and im not gaga over the taste).when it was done and veggies were fork tender it tasted nice.i think i could have cut the amount of oil a little.making again.

Love this recipe!  Healthy and sooo good.  This is the 2nd time making this.  I made the "marinade" the night before and let it sit.  I ended up cooking a little longer...like 10 minutes...but that's to your liking.  I did red bliss potatoes this time and I didn't peel them.  I also added carrots.  You can really add whatever you want. Common sense, some things will take longer than others.  So good with a great steak!  Even better the next day, great for left overs for another dish.  Thank you!!

Simple and delicious. Easy to mix up the kinds of vegetables you use - I added zucchini and turnip instead of the sweet potatoes.

I added broccoli, mushrooms (very large, halved), and garlic (chopped). I, like another reviewer, had difficulty with everything roasting in sync. The potatoes took longer than anything else by twelve minutes. Next time, I'll chop the potatoes smaller or else put them in first for twelve minutes, and then add everything else. Very delicious! I used lemon juice instead of the balsamic vinegar, because I didn't want the bitterness. Yumbly!

I made this as a main dish for one, intending to save half, use stock to deglaze the pan and make soup with the other half... but it's gone. Whoops!
I had to make a couple of substitutions. I didn't have any balsamic vinegar(gasp!), so I used two good splashes of homemade herbal vinegar. I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used fresh oregano. I also used an unknown type of squash (Long and oblong with a very hard woody shell; orange flesh and brown seeds - any guesses?)for the first time, and it was unbelievably good roasted! The trick is to leave them roast until just before the point of burning, so they get a lovely carmelized taste. I cooked mine in a rice cooker, because I don't have an oven.

I loved this recipe but I made a few additions to the recipe. I added a little mustard which brought a burst of tang, added whatever vegetables I had and used dried thyme and rosemary instead, which worked very well I might add. I also added a wee bit of lemon in the dressing along with the balsamic. Also I kept mine a wee longer in the oven since I like my veggies well done.

Excellent! Used dried rosemary and dried thyme but quartered the amount. Baked the root veggies first at 450 for 25 minutes then added mushrooms, red onion and peppers.Baked at 400 for another 20 minutes stirring every 10 minutes. Sprinkled feta cheese over the top when finished baking and yum,yum,yum. Everyone loved these!

Love this!  There are so many variations available too but even as the recipe is written it's great!  Very hearty but healthy at the same time.  It's a wonderful way to use up some extra veggies I have around the house.

Made this last night and my husband and I both loved it!  I didn't use squash and only used one of each potatoes.  I did everything else the same with slightly less oil and vinegar due to the fewer veggies.  I also reduced the temp to 450 after about 10 minutes because the onions were cooking too fast.  It turned out delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish is fantastic!!!  I used what I had and have made it 4 times already the same way each time.   Baked carrots, red potatoes, gold potatoes, red onion for 30 minutes then I added red and green bell pepper and asparagus and let it cook another 10 to 15 minutes. It smells, looks, and tastes amazing!  So easy and will impress guests.

Very easy made as directed but skipped peppers,added carrots.Unlike another review that said skip this if you do not have fresh herbs I made it using dried.I just cut the amount down.I served them with chicken cooked in a George Forman grill.It is a must for an easy recipe that tastes wonderful,reduce balsamic drizzled over recipe.I found chicken recipe on site as well.

I've made this recipe recently, and my husband and I loved it very much. The only thing I've altered was the amount of the vinegar-I used less of it, and the recipe still was a bit on a vinegary side. Next times (which will happen again and again) I'll use even less of it. I only had on-hand a piece of red sweet pepper, some red and some russet potatoes and 1 red onion, but the dish turned out very crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, looking and smelling extremely appetizing and delicious ! The best baked veggies I've ever had !

My son made these vegetables.  We all enjoyed the mixture of veggies and the seasonings.  Had with poultry but would be good with any meat.

I gotta say I'm part of the minority vote on this recipe - there was nothing special or outstanding about this dish. I didn't feel like the dressing enhanced the flavor of the vegetables. It wasn't bad or inedible by any means, it just wasn't anything exciting. Not what I was looking for.

This is my signature contribution to my family's holiday gatherings!  Rich and delicious, it makes for great comfort food, too.  I use a little less rosemary than the recipe calls for, though, based on feedback from the relatives.

I followed the recipe exactly, and my veggies turned out so good that even my husband (that will only eat vegetables with ranch dressing) liked them!  My 2 year-old daughter liked them as well.  Next time I am going to cook them covered for the first half of the time since they did dry out a little bit and also add some carrots, broccoli and cauliflower.  Can't wait to cook this again - very easy and delicious!

I think this is a great vegetable recipe! I actually prepped it all two days before cooking it - I was on vacation & didn't want to have to chop everything the day of. It turned out great! Will make again.

Loved these! I used dried herbs, no thyme, they were lightly seasoned. I followed the directions from reviews and roasted the root veggies first, for about 40 minutes, then added the peppers, onions, and eggplant for another 30 or so minutes. Turned out great, and even the kids liked it! Didn't get the caramelization I would have liked, so I'll have to keep working at it.

good! I've made something similar but not with balsamic vinager so this was a nice twist. I didn't have the winter squash but I used what I had on hand which was zuchinni and yellow squash. Will make again:)

I roasted zucchini, sweet potato, parsnips, green and red pepper, sweet onion, and onion cut into 2 inch strips rather than cubed this way and it was delicious!  We didn't have vinegar and while I didn't measure the olive oil, I am pretty sure it was more than this recipe.  YUM!

Excellent recipe.  I reduced the temp to 450 and gently turned the vegetables every 10 min.  The recipe reminds me of autumn - sweet potatoes, butternut squash - pair it up with any meat - very flavorful.

Used 1 very large Yukon potato instead of 3, and par cooked it in microwave. Subbed 2 small zucchini for butternut squash. I think eggplant would work also. I also used only 1/2 of an onion and 1 red bell pepper. Kept oil and vinegar amts. the same(used white balsamic). I also used all fresh herbs. even though I decreased amts. a bit I do not think this would be enough for 12 as stated in original directions. Very colorful nice side.

I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar.  I thought it had too strong of a lemon flavor, but my husband liked it.  Next time, I would cut the lemon juice in half.

This recipe drew rave reviews from our guests. Following the tips from previous reviewers, I cooked the carrots and Yukon potatoes for 15 minutes extra before adding the rest of the vegetables. I also used dried thyme and it worked fine. Love this and will definitely make it again.

Overall the recipe is great, however there rosemary and thyme almost overpowered the freshness of my veggies. My fiancee and I definitely liked it, but both agreed the next time we have this we will cut the seasonings in half. The great thing about this recipe is you can pretty much use any veggies you like and it will taste great!

It lasted several days. It was pretty good. Made different dishes with it. And I still have some left. Make sure you size the dish down for how many servings you want. It seem like servings for ten people. I will add some more vegetables next time.

A staple in my family! This recipe is PERFECT! Fresh herbs make a HUGE difference, but it comes out good with dry also. One piece of advice: mind that the squash and sweet potatoes cook much quicker than the potatoes, so cut the potatoes into smaller chunks than the rest. Also, it is not necessary to have all the ingredients...I never use the peppers and frequently mess around with the potatoes and squash proportions.

I would give this ten stars if I could. Found the recipe on a whim when I needed to use up root veggies. The balsamic added a great sweet flavor. I only had dried rosemary and thyme and think using fresh would definitely make the dish even better.

Popular Thanksmas dish.  I probably should have parboiled the parsnips, as they were uncooked and the rest was done.

I made this for the very first time and took it to a friend's house for dinner.  It was absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as described and I wouldn't change a thing.  Even the kids were going back for seconds!  It is a wonderful medley of fresh flavors.

I stayed exactly with the recipe except I used 2 bags for the marinade, 1 bag for the root vegs. and the other for the soft vegs and I added cherry tomatoes to the soft bag. I started with the root vegs. first for the first 20 mins. then added the soft vegs. for the remaining 20 mins. I used a large pizza pan because the cooking sheets we had were to small. this is the perfect side, my wife and I both loved this, infact it's going to be on the table this christmas dinner with the broiled cornish hens. ENJOY.

I cooked this on the BBQ because the oven was full. Turned out great. Very tasty. Used 5lbs small potatoes, 3lbs sweet potatoes and 2 sweet onion. Onions got a little over cooked, but not bad at all, Might be a good idea to add onion about half way through if possible, if not, not a big deal.

The flavor was great!  I added a zucchini too.  My vegetables were very mushy, but I did bake it 10 minutes longer just to be safe because I was cooking this the day before dinner.  Then I reheated in crockpot.  Next time, I would not cook it 10 minutes longer, maybe even cook it in less time so they aren't mushy at all.

Very good recipe, that I have been making for Thanksgiving for the past three years.  However, prep time is definitely not 15 minutes and closer to 45 min to 1 hour.  But worth it! Also, added carrots and parsnips for more variety.

Me and my family really liked this recipe! The only thing we didn't like was the size of the rosemary. I recommend when making this to make sure it's chopped very fine otherwise it feels like eating grass. We would also recommend trying green, yellow, and red bell peppers in it. We would also leave out the potatoes next time. We also didn't have balsamic vinegar so we used only one tablespoon of regular vinegar and it worked great. I recommend trying this recipe!

So delicious!  I used 1 heaping Tbl. of fresh thyme  and left out the rosemary because I didn't have any fresh.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. of butternut squash and 4 yukon gold instead of 3.  I cooked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes,  gave it a stir, put back in for 20, stirred again, and back in for 10.  Wonderful flavor and something my squash hating husband ate.

Love the assortment of vegies, however the spices are not quite right.  I'm gonna go back and read thru the reviews to see what the perfect combination is.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This is my go-to vegetable dish whenever I'm not sure what to have.  I just add whatever is available in the fridge or garden and throw in some garlic cloves as well.  Simple, easy, and always great!!  I do only cube the potatoes and leave everything else a little bigger.

All I had on hand were butternut squash, zucchini, and onions.  I didn't even have potatoes.  I also had to substitute dried herbs for fresh.  I simply chopped all of the veggies and spread them out on a baking sheet. I then drizzled them with olive oil and sprinkled dried rosemary, thyme, basil, salth and pepper on top and tossed them around on the pan to evenly distribute the oil and seasonings.  This was super easy and fabulous. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! You can really taste the vegetables and the flavors all complement each other nicely.  Only used sweet potatoes rather than any whites and added carrots.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.

my wife, who is an excellent cook, made this recipe for supper tonight and she followed the instructions to the letter, however, the dish had very little taste.  Every thing tasted the same with no distictive flavour of any of the vegetables.  Was it cooked too long, not enought spices

I used dried herbs as I didn't have fresh.  And I did put foil over the pan as they baked, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  These veggies are amazing!  Even my picky son loved them! Thanks!

This was awesome. I used potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and baby carrots.  You may want to "up" the seasoning.  I also used a touch of balsamic vinegar.

I made mine with butternut squash, zucchini, broccoli, and red onions. Covered with foil for the first 15 minutes. I used fried herbs as well and had no problems. Delicious!

It came out kind of bitter, but I did substitute the lemon juice for balsamic vinegar, and I added extra rosemary and thyme.  My mom was shocked that the recipe didn't call for oregano so I think I might add that to the leftovers and try to spruce them up that way.

This was fantastic! I made it the first time for Christmas Eve and everyone wanted more. I used dried thyme and rosemary, cut the rosemary in half then, and the thyme into a quarter of what was listed, and it was delicious. I also subbed carrots for squash. Will definitely be making over and over.

I used all root veggies and Brussels but felt it lacked a little bit of flavor.  Next time I need to cook longer and maybe double the oil, vinegar and spices.  I love roasted veggies so I'll work on this one!

I don't know what I did wrong, but it was too mushy instead of roasted and I think too viegery as well. took it to a church pot luck and brought almost all of it home as did not go over at all, and husband didn't like at all. I'm giving it 2 stars because it may have been my fault it was mushy.

I made this last night for a preview for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful. I did exactly what the recipe calls for except I didn't have the fresh thyme or rosemary, so I used dried and just condensed the amount appropriately (listed on the side of the spice container). It was great! I think I will use this in place of mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving to lighten up the meal and make more room for fresh vegetables. This is a wonderful healthy alternative to all of the fat.

YUMM! I only used green, red and yellow peppers and a sweet yellow onion. This way everything would be done at the same time.  I tossed everything together on a silpat placed on a baking sheet and sprinkled some salt and pepper on top.  Use a good quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil!

Made this for a thanksgiving potluck and received a few compliments on it.  Didn't use red peppers, but did use turnips.  The fresh herbs are great, using dried would definitely not taste as good.

Easy, excellent, beautiful dish! It is definitely best when using fresh herbs and spices. I have made this dish many times. Perfect side dish for grilled steak, chicken or any other meat.

I made this for a barbaque for 25 people. I added yellow peppers and red bliss potatoes. I put mushrooms in near the end of the cooking time. I left out the rosemary. The vegetarians were so grateful and it was a great side dish for the burgers and dogs.

i didnt have fresh thyme and i used lemon juice instead of vinegar - those are the only changes i made.  great recipe.  i checked the veggies at 30 minutes and thought the potatoes were still a tiny bit hard, so i cooked it for 10 minutes more.  should've stopped at 30 because the veggies, although they stayed pretty much together, were too mushy for my taste.  i would have preferred to have them a little harder.  so 30 minutes in my oven wouldve been perfect.  thanks for the recipe!

This was a dilicious recipe, very different from my regular roasted vegetables recipe. I omitted the Yukon Gold potatoes. I also added mushrooms, zucchini and baby carrots. As suggested by other reviewers I baked the root vegetables in a large cookie sheet for 30 minutes and the rest of the vegetables in another pan for 15 minutes. The fresh herbs gave a really nice flavor. Thanks Saundra!

YUM!  I am trying to follow a diet requiring more vegetables and this recipes helps fit the bill!  It is low sodium.  I reduced the oil and omitted and salt and it was perfect.  What a great combination of veggies - I have a new favorite.  I am making this every Sunday and doubling the recipe to take to work for lunches for the week.

Great recipe! The balsamic vinegar made it a bit sweeter than I would have liked (along with veggies caramelizing). Next time I'll try red wine vinegar.

I made this dish exactly the way it was written--it's phenomenal!  I served it on Christmas day and my entire family raved about it. The simplicity of the ingredients are deceiving;  the roasting process completely transforms the taste of the vegetables into sweet, nutty tasting vegetables that you can't wait to make again.  The only problem is, there just wasn't enough!

I threw this together one day with whatever veg I had on hand (white potato, sweet potato, garlic, carrots, peppers and onion)and it turned out great.  One thing I learned, roast hearty veg first and add peppers and onions halfway thru.  Husband asked for it again.

I served this on New Year's Eve to 15 people.  Everyone loved it.  I marinated the vegtables in the oil, vineger and spices a few hours before cooking.  I am going to keep this recipe as one of my standard servings.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After cooking, the butternut squash and the sweet potato looked the same, so it was confusing to eat.  I didn't care for the red pepper flavor.  I am going to try it again with alterations.

Oh wow!  This is so incredibly easy and equally delicious.  The aroma in the house while this was baking was almost more than we could stand.  It goes great along side of roasted pork or chicken.  Don't change a thing, it's perfect.  Where I live fresh herbs are not readily available so use dried herbs and cut the quantity in half.

Excellent recipe--the dressing/sauce was phenomenal.  I omitted the squash and added carrots, eggplants, zucchini, and mushrooms.  As suggested, I put the potatoes (and carrots) in first for about 30 minutes, then added the rest of the veggies.  I made this for a dinner and was surprised by how many people asked me for the recipe.

Great on the grill!  I sometimes add a bit of dried onion soup mix to get a little extra flavor if my veggie mix is heavy on potatoes or something.  Otherwise, it's great as it is.

Perfection!  This was everything I expected it to be.  I used sweet potatoes, red potatoes, onion, mushrooms, and green peppers and used a combination of dried and fresh herbs.  Don't be afraid to liberally sprinkle more seasonings to your taste; I found I had to add more s & p and a touch of garlic powder.  Oh, and I also added a splash of lemon juice.  I opted to turn the heat down to around 430 and roast the potatoes  and onion first, then after about 35 minutes, I added the mushrooms and peppers.  Very very good! Thank you for posting this recipe!

This recipe is a great jumping off point for roasting any vegetables.  I used summer vegetables and took this to a potluck bar-b-que.  I cooked the veggies most of the way, then took it to the hostess' house and put it in her oven on warm until we were ready to eat.  It was soooooo delicious!  I got lots of compliments, too.  Thanks for help when I didn't know where to start.

I love veggies and am always trying to find new recipes. I just had to give this one a try! I didn't have all the veggies listed, so I used the ones I had. I also added a bit more balsamic vinegar. Loved It! I plan to make again, with the ingredients listed. Thanks for sharing!

I made this EXACTLY like the recipe called (except minus the squash and I added some carrots and zucchini for good measure) and it came out PERFECT. ABSOLUTELY delicious.  A couple of days later my dinner guests called from the grocery store to find out all the ingredients!!!!

Very Good Roasted Vegetables. I made as a side with the Roasted Rack of Lamb recipe from this site. Next time I will keep the vegetable pieces large so they don't burn and cook evenly. I used fresh herbs but it seems like you could make it with dried, as long as you scale it down (1/3 dried to 1 fresh).

Delicious! Could add other veggies but great with the veggies in this recipe. Veggies browned nicely in dark jelly roll, however, not in stainless steel.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe!! Made it 3 times and always comes out PERFECT! Good with any vegetables. I've tried with eggplant and acorn squash as well. Must add lots of sweet potatoes! They give it the best flavor...I use alot more sweet potatoes than regular white potatoes everytime I make this.

My  husband does not like sweet potatoes or squash (I know, they are both soo good!) So, I substituted with carrots and Idaho potatoes, used dry herbs, added some minced garlic, left out the peppers until there was 15 minutes left, and it turned out great!  Next time I will add some green beans.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am just getting into cooking, and I could not have found a better recipe for an amateur cook. I cut the vegetables in larger chunks, and altogether was in the oven for an hour. Next time, I will throw in much more onions and garlic cloves - I love how they carmelize. This is a wonderful, versatile recipe.

Love this recipe. Ultimate harvest comfort food. Goes great with ham. I usually don't bother with the sweet potato since I love the butternut squash and feel it lends enough sweetness to the dish.

Good dish - nothing fan-tastic. May be due to the fact that I didn't use fresh herbs. If I try again, I'll use fresh.

This recipe is the BOMB! Do it exactly as instructed . . . or. . . try it with green and yellow beans, brussel sprouts, yellow summer squash and zucchini.  There just is no way to get this wrong unless you use dried herbs, believe me, I have tried it both ways when I did not have the fresh on hand. There is no comparison.  Throw on some fresh grated Parmesan just out of the oven. Died and went to roasted veggie heaven!!

Love this recipe whether it be in the summer or in the fall with extra squash! Fresh herbs are a must.. I doubled this recipe and served with a dry-rub slow grilled set of baby back pork ribs and it was all gone once the company left!

Awesome. I'd been looking for a quick recipe for
roasted veggies, and I think this one is it:). I
made it for my Girls Night, and everyone gobbled 
it up - there was nothing left:) I used whatever
I had on hand - cauliflowers, garnet yams, red
potatoes, red onions, red bell pepper, green bell
pepper, and a few baby carrots.

I made this exactly as written.  I thought it was good, but will be using lemon juice (in place of the balsamic vinegar) next time I make it.  I thought the balsamic overwhelmed the rest of the flavors.

This is a great recipe! I'm not a fan of Squash so I substituted it for Parsnips. Tasted fantastic. 
Thanks for the recipe! Will be making these again for sure.

This was good. Kind of bland. I would use less rosemary next time as it was a bit overwhelming for me. And I put the root veggies in first as suggested for the first 20 minutes, and they still weren't completely done! I think playing with the spices and cooking the root veggies thoroughly will make it a five star roasted veggie recipe.

This was great!  I left out the onion (I am allergic) and it still came out wonderfully!  I added more seasonings and fresh garlic.  The flavors worked very well together.

I have tried a lot of vegetable side dishes lately and this is the first one my husband raved about.  I do not like a lot of vegetables and even I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is just the right amount of seasonings to add flavor, but not take away from the true taste of the veggies.

Really yummy and easy! I only used one red pepper, half of a red onion, and one Russet potato because it was just my husband and I. Perfect amount for the two of us! Even though I had fewer veggies, I made almost the same amount of sauce. I also added some minced garlic and a sprinkling of sea slat, and I didn't have fresh thyme so I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons dried. I'll be making this again and again with other vegetables and different herbs. Thank you Saundra!

This was very good and easy to make.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I used 2 potatoes, 1 sweet potato, 1 red onion and 1/2 of a butternut squash.  I thought this was about half of the vegetables that the recipe called for so I halved the seasoning mix.  I think my estimates were off and I could have added more herbs and balsamic.   I will definitely being trying again with different vegetables and additional seasonings.

Chose this because i was looking for a unique way to cook a squash i bought (impulse buy that sat on the counter for 3 days!)  Used what i had on hand as well; asparagus, carrots, onion, yukon golds, garlic.  Cooked the root veggies in the microwave for a few minutes to speed up the roasting process.  Overall pretty good, the squash got eaten, along with all the other veggies :)

My family loved it!  I used more veggies, and therefore used more of the seasoning ingredients.  Great recipe!

Super!  Great addition to my files.  Cut back on Rosemary and Thyme based on our personal tastes.

Delicious but a bit greasy. I will use less oil next time, perhaps even just a light spray of olive oil. I added baby carrots and baby zuchinnis (from Trader Joes) and two cloves of minced garlic. It made two large baking trays full of yummy carmelized vegatables. My vegetarian daughter gobbled them up. The cooking time was right on, but the prep time was waaay off. It took me close to 45 minutes to peel and chop all the vegetables, including the fresh herbs.

I think this has a great flavor and a beautiful presentation but I have made it for two family dinners and no one really seems to rave over it. That's my only reason for four stars.

I used more sweet potato and squash and less yukon gold since we had another potato dish.  I left out the onion, too.  This was fine.  Nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad.

This was fantastic!  Even my brother-in-law, who hates vegetables, went back for seconds.  I didn't have rosemary or thyme, so I used 3 tablespoons of Sylvia's special seasoning instead. It was perfect.  I served it with the salmon with pecan crunch coating, sweet potaotes with orange and cinnamon sauce, and a basic risotto.  It was a fantastic Christmas meal.

i liked this recipe. it is pretty on the plate and quite tasty.  the potato gives it more "body" than an ordinary veggie dish. it's a bit on the heavier side.

I think this was one of the best vegetable recipes I've ever tried.  I used yellow squash instead of butternut because it's what I had on hand but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  I had way too many leftovers even after reheating them for lunch the next day so unless you're cooking for a crowd of people, use less veggies.

Excellent recipe. I served a baby shower last weekend with sweet potato biscuits and rosemary ham. It was a beautiful dish perfect for fall. Because you can add any veggie you prefer it's very versatile and is good even when lukewarm and as leftovers. I would recommend pre-microwaving the potatoes and then mixing in as I cut the baby red potatoes that I used very small and they were still not quite as tender as I would have liked. Great dish though.

Very good! I only used butternut squash, yukon golds, and baby carrots as I didn't have the other veggies, but I used the same seasonings, and it was just so sweet and delicious. I can't believe how much my husband and I enjoyed it. Thank you!

Ok, I was bad, I added a couple of small pats of butter, but just a few.  This was great and next time I'll do without the calories of the butter.  Add the veggies that you like, I wouldn't change a thing, like I did.  It was terrific and the company loved.  Thanks for the post.

Wow! Who knew veggies could look and taste so good? I basically followed the advice of TUNISIANSWIFE (thank you) and these turned out great. If I hadn't added the extra spices I do think that this would have been bland. Thanks.

Loved this dish!!! I added lots of spices (basil, crushed red pepper, thyme, oregano, seasoned salt...)  Just about anything works.  The aroma made everyone in the house hungry!

A truly useful, multipurpose recipe - I use this all the time, whether it's to accompany a big roast or to make a mid-week lamb chop a little more interesting. I usually cook the potatoes in a separate, different way and then I don't have o worry too much about cooking times. There are not many reipes that the whole family eats with relish but this is one of them - my semi-fussy three-year-old thinks these are close enough to chips (ie french fries) to clean her plate and ask for seconds. Loved by all!

One of the best recipes I've ever tried!!  I've made it without the squash just because I didn't have it on hand and it was still wonderful.

Very good veggies!  I was a little dicipointed with the lack of crispiness, but i think that was my fault.  Other than that they were great!

The flavour combination of these vibrantly coloured vegetables is what made this dish tasty.  I did not like the rosemary and thyme in the dressing.

This was very good. I used most of the veggies in the recipe but missed some of them. And I didn't have the fresh herbs, so will try again and it will probably be even better.

I completely agree with everyone who endorsed this recipe. The fresh herbs make the dish. It is the ideal dish to bring to a large gathering because the portion size is large, it's easy to reheat, and it will please vegetarians and carnivores alike.

My husband and I both found this recipe very starchy and a little bland. We used dry spices rather than fresh spices, so maybe that had something to do with it.  We had tons of leftovers that we ended up throwing out after 3 days because we were sick of eating them.

This was wonderful! I served this at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. This is such a great way to add vegetables to your diet. The only change I made was that I added zuchinni and carrots to the recipe. I will definately be making this on a regular basis from now on.

This was the perfect side dish for the Garlic Prime Rib (also on this site).  I debated on whether to use the butternut squash but finally did in the end and left out one red pepper.  Next time I think I'll leave out the squash and add the other pepper.  Trying to peel the squash was not worth the effort.

This is a DELICIOUS dish. I also made it with carrots instead of the squash and it turned out to be so tasty. I did add a little bit more of the herbs since I was cooking for a crowd. Everybody asked me for the recipe. Thanks a lot!

This was good but I don't think it deserves 5 stars. 
Also I had to run to 3 stores before I found the fresh thyme.  

I've always roasted potatoes with some herbes de provence & olive oil and will probably probably try adding some balsamic vinegar next time.

This was pretty good.  My husband ate some also and he doesn't like squash, but didn't seem to mind it in here.  Not my favorite dish ever, but it was good.

Delicious, and just as good when reheated the next day.  The variety of colors and shapes makes the dish look as appetizing as it smells!

I used a mixture of summer squash and zucchini instead of the butternut squash, and added carrots and a green bell pepper.  Next time I'm going to use pearl onions instead of red onion, as some of the red onion pieces got a little dry and burnt.  Overall, though, a great success and a recipe I'll be using over and over again.

Awesome, just awesome.  I threw in an extra gold potato.  We had this with the "Smothered Filet Mignon" recipe from this site and it made for a wonderful meal.

We really enjoyed this - I crumbled some goat cheese on top before I served it so it melted a bit amongst the veggies - really tasty.  Also for a veggie treat, I omitted the squash/potataoes and added peppers and served over pasta and crumbled goat cheese - excellent!

This was very good and could be used with just about any veggie. I used carrots, normal bakeing potatoes and vidalia onions. I will be using this recipe for a long time to come.

Everyone loved this! I thought it was good but not exceptional, but I'm not a big squash person. Cut out the regular potatoes and upped the squash and the sweet potatoes. I also added scallions. Balsamic vinegar is a must as are fresh herbs. I'd do it again for a big holiday get together.

I've been hoping to find a recipe that uses butternut squash and this one was perfect! I omitted the sweet potato and just added more another Yukon Gold instead. MMMMMmmmmm... oh and the delicious aroma while it's cooking!

I'm a big fan of peppers, onions, and garlic. This recipe caught my eye. I changed it up a little and made it simpler for me. I used green, red, and yellow peppers. I used the red onion. I added garlic and salt then baked it in the oven. Delicious - thanks for the idea!

It was flavorful without tasting "weird" (for those of us not accustomed to new herby flavors). Any winter squash substitutes well for the butternut. Acorn was terrific. I will do this one often in the fall and winter!

I will admit I was skeptical.  Red peppers, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, red onions and yukon golds - together?  But oh the taste!  These were fantastic - I served with pork tenderloin and mashed potatoes.  Fabulous!
