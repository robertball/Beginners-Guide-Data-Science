Surprisingly delicious! I used olive oil instead of butter, and I didn't have any tarragon at home. I also reduced the amount of yogurt by a little bit, just to retain the spinach flavor. This recipe's a keeper!

If you can get past the somewhat nasty appearance of this dark green soup, it actually tastes pretty good.  I used fresh spinach rather than frozen, and I substituted sour cream and some leftover cottage cheese for the yogurt.  Topped it with a tablespoon of sour cream and some bacon bits.  Not bad to go with a sandwich.

reminds me of a healthy cream of spinach soup.  i amped it up with a ton of garlic and parmesan.  i believe it is a good starting canvas which can be quite delicious once you doctor it up to your taste.  i will make it again.  with a red garnish such as tomatoes or red peppers this could be a fun holiday dish!

Absolutely delicious. And easy! I will be making it again. I made it with sandwiches instead of tomato soup. I like it better than the tomato that I had been making.

Good stuff!  It turned out great, I did make a few slight alterations: I added garlic nixed the tarragon used veg broth instead (i'm a vegetarian) I only used 1.5 cups of broth and 1/2 cup of cream Instead of lemon slices I topped with grated asiago and parmesan....delish!

This was easy to make but we didn't really like the flavour.  I love spinach but this was not tasty like spinach should be.  We did use fresh spinach right out of the garden & not frozen.  We won't make it again.

I was drawn to this recipe because I'm a vegetarian and also because I had some plain yogurt I needed to use up.  It's a nice soup, but perhaps a little on the bland side.  Not sure what to kick it up with.  Will probably make it again when I have the extra yogurt situation again.

This soup was so easy to make, delicious and ultra healthy.  I love spinach and am always looking for easy ways to add some to my diet.  This soup is easy to double and keep in the fridge for an easy vegetable serving anytime.  Thanks to whomever posted this.

It was very easy and tasted good. I omitted the onion. I added a couple dashes of lemon juice to the mix instead of garnishing with wedges. Next time I would omit the salt and set some cooked spinach aside so there could be some chunks in it. I love cooking with yogurt as opposed to heavy cream.

This was ok. I appreciated the ease of preparation and the unique creamy texture. I doctored up the recipe a bit by adding 2 cloves of garlic, increased amounts of herbs and spices, and some crushed red pepper. I also added a teaspoon of fresh lime juice and a touch of cream at the end. Topped with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Overall it was pretty good with all of these modifications. I served it with corn bread (it's what I had in the pantry), but I think it would be good with homemade parmesan croutons on top. My initial thought on the color was that it would be a fun starter course for a St. Patrick's Day meal. Also, I didn't like the tarragon in it. Maybe next time I will try a little fresh basil. I'm willing to try it again, but I don't think it will become a frequent dish at my house.

This was pretty good for how quick and easy it is. I made it as the directions said, then when I served it I thought it needed a little oomph so I added some crushed red pepper flakes, It was yummy and had a little kick!

I hate it when people don't follow a recipe yet give review for it!  Yet, here I go, sharing in case it could help someone else...  There's nothing wrong with this recipe, I just had loads of fresh spinach and wanted to use some of it by making soup, and am vegetarian, so used 16 oz of fresh spinach.  I had no yogurt so used a little sour cream. I whizzed raw spinach in a blender before cooking (which necessitated using extra water) and used onion powder instead of fresh onion in the interest of time.  Love the nutmeg in it.  Being vegetarian, I used water, food yeast, garlic, salt and olive oil instead of chicken broth.  When done, I thickened it a bit with instant potato flakes. Using fresh spinach, I added extra water.  We really enjoyed this and plan to make often.

Delicious and easy to make.  I added a little less yogurt and 3 tbsp. of light sour cream for richness.  I added a tablespoon of vinegar during cooking to make up for the creaminess of the sour cream.

A suggestion for serving:  crumble hard boiled egg over soup.

Ok.  I thought this was a really weird line up of ingredients.  Just so happens I had some plain yogurt and fresh spinach in the fridge that were about to get tossed so I figured why not try it.  It turned out great.  Really tasty!  I added some garlic but other than that, made it exactly as the recipe calls.  I will definatly be making it again!

It was okay.  My husband turned his nose up at the idea of me serving him spinach soup for dinner, but he actually went back for a second bowl... so I give it 4 stars.  I ended up adding some egg noodles because it seemed a little plain all by itself.

Light and delicious.  Didn't bother to puree it as the frozen spinach was already chopped.
