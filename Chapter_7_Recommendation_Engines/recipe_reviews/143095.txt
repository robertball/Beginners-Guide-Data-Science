Not bad for a smoothie type of shake - I cut this way back and used fat free vanilla yogurt and less ice. To make it a little sweeter and to add a little more strawberry flavor I added some strawberry jam.

Frosty cold, that's for sure, but only average in flavor.  Even tho' I used strawberry yogurt the banana flavor still dominated.  It could also stand to be a tad sweeter. Finally, unless you like mammoth-sized smoothies, scaling this recipe to one serving still made two, good sized drinks.

This shake was good and not too sweet.  The only additions I added were 1/2 scoop of soy protein and 1 teaspoon ground flaxseed.

I didn't assemble these exact amounts, but I make this regularly with my brown bananas. I keep frozen strawberries in the freezer to use and also use strawberry banana yogurt when I have it. These are great!

Very good.  I would never normally be able to get my son eat strawberries, bananas and yogurt!!! This is a great tasty way hide what goodness is really inside! The only difference is next time I am going to try strawberry yogurt for a stronger strawberry flavor.

My kids loved this. I used organic vanilla yogurt and frozen bananas, which eliminated the need for ice cubes. I also added a tbsp. or so of flax seed. They gulped it down and asked for more!

THis is more like a smoothie than a shake but still very good. I used the whole container of strawberries and just one banana because the yogurt I used was banilla yogurt (very good stuff) and 6 ice cubes. Yummy I loved it, the kids only took a couple drinks, but theyre picky weird eaters!!!!

I liked this a lot.  I had to sub vanilla yogurt for plain (what I had in my fridge) so the shakes were rather sweet.  Next time I'll use plain, low-fat yogurt and they'll be perfect.

I absolutely loved this smoothie. This is the type that I really like, tangy and not too sweet. I used frozen strawberries and added 1/2 scoop of protein supplemet strawberry flavor.

I followed the recipe but didn't care for this. I ended up adding about 1/2 a cup of sugar to make it work.

I thought it was pretty good. I bought the ingredients for about five dollars, so pretty budget friendly. I think it would’ve been better if I had a better blender, I got a lot of chunks of ice in mine. But if you have a better blender I’m sure it would be more smooth.

I made this 1 serving, but I still had to cut back on all the ingredients to make this fit in my 16 oz single serve Ninja Blender cup. I used 4 oz strawberry Greek yogurt, 1 frozen banana, as many strawberries and as much ice as I could make fit. It came out fine.
