These were really good.  I read a lot of reviews and the one common complaint was that there was too much mustard, so I cut it down to two tablespoons and added 1 tbsp of honey.  My husband who doesn't like mustard said that they were great.  In my oven, I had to cook them 30 minutes.  I did 25 at the 325 and 5 minutes under the broiler to carmelize them.  I'll definitely do them again!

I used butterflied pork chops and I adjusted the recipe a little. I used 3 Tbsp. French's Sweet and Tangy Honey Mustard and 2 (heaping) Tbsp. brown sugar...I mixed the 1 Tbsp. Lemon Juice right into the mixture to make it easier to put on the chops. I put the whole thing into my 9x13 baking dish and cooked it at 350 for 30 min. It turned out great! I transfered the chops to a platter and poured the leftover juices into a pan on the stovetop and cooked them for a few minutes to make a yummy sauce to put on top of the chops. If you have a large ovenproof skillet, you could use that instead of your 9x13 and save on cleanup! Overall an easy dish that my 2yr old and very picky 5 year old ate!

This was really, really good. My entire family loved it. Not one complaint. I did 3 Tbl sugar and 2 Tbl mustard. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Great, great dinner. Very easy too. I think I did cook it longer than 20 minutes, maybe next time I'd up it to 350?

Okay...So I made this last night. And the way I made it got five stars but if I'd just followed the recipe...it would've been very bland. What I did was mix the brown sugar w/spice brown mustard in the same proportions. Then, before putting it on the chops, I made a rub of onion powder and garlic powder then added a little corriander and ginger. Mixed that and rubed it on the chops. I drizzled olive oil in the bottom of a 8 x 8 glass baking dish (because I only used 2 butterflied chops) and then put the chops in the dish. I then spread the brown suger/mustard mix on top and let bake for about 40 minutes. They were very good and probably could've only cooked for 30 minutes. Hope this helps.

I was looking for a recipe for a pork dish that I had at a local restaurant.  This is even better!!I used sliced pork loin (about 1/2") and did sear it in a skillet first.  I mixed the glaze as instructed but used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh.  I cooked these longer: about 20 minutes at 325 and then another 20-30 at 350.  These were extremely tender and absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!! Even my husband who is not a mustard fan liked them.  Next time I may try a couple of minutes under the broiler just before serving.

This was great. I made 2 servings and used the sauce for 4 servings and it was perfect. For those who don't know what "butterflying" is ( I had to look it up), it means just slicing the meat in half without cutting all the way through on one side. I added glaze in the middle as well and baked for 30 minutes.

wow I love this recipe, however I add Stove Top Pork stuffin mix to it, I prepared it as the box says and then spreaded it on top of the pork chops and the that all ready had the sauce on them, and I also used quick fry thin pork chops and they came out really great. I cooked it for 30mins for 11 pork chops and I doubled the recipe also, Thanks for a great idea.

Easy easy, tasty tasty! I used dijon mustard, and also mixed in the lemon juice. I lightly browned the chops before baking at 350 for 30 minutes and broiling for a couple additional minutes to caramelize the glaze. This recipe is a real winner if you're looking for a quick, flavorful way to cook chops.

This recipe is so easy!  I have made it a couple of times, each time trying a new kind of mustard - resulting in a unique product every time.  I did need to cook it longer than recommended.  In the future I will increase the baking temperature or brown the pork chops first.  A great recipe for working moms like me!!!

I liked the flavor of this.  I threw this together in my crockpot over some potatoes and onions, with broccoli on top for a complete meal.  Cooked it on low for almost 8 hours and it came out good.  Thanks for sharing...

I thought this was very easy and had a good taste but my husband and kids felt it was to much mustard.  I will try this again but use less mustard and maybe add some pineapple slices.

This was good! Next time, I probably will cut down on the mustard, but I liked the flavor overall! I did cook at 325 for 20 minutes, then I broiled for about 5 minutes because we like our pork a little more done! It was still juicy and good!!

This was so delicious!  I didn't have any problem with the glaze falling off!  I, too, used 2 tbsp of dijon mustard and 1 tbsp of yellow mustard.  I also seasoned the pork chops lighlty with seasoning salt and garlic powder.  I made this with white rice and doubled the glaze to add some to the rice.  It was excellent!!

Ok, I didn't think these were great, but I didn't think these were horrible.  I had the same problems as some other reviewers (ex: little taste to the chop and very little glazin going on).  I don't think I will try this one again, but I thank you for a new and different idea on pork.

We really did not enjoy this recipe.  First off, you really need to cook these for at least 40 minutes to make sure they're done.  The pork chops came out very tender and were certainly easy to make with ingredients we had on hand, but they had very little flavor.  I don't think we'll try to make these again.

Yummy, I was a little worried about trying this recipe. I'm glad that I tried them. My pork chops had a nice thick glaze on them. I don't know why other's had such a bad time with the glaze. Although it may have worked for me because I used 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard and 1 tablespoon of yellow mustard. I also added spices to the chops. I hope this helps with the recipe. Oh yea I baked mine on 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.

After reading the reviews, I used equal amounts of brown sugar and mustard. My pork chops were boneless loin chops, about 1/2 inch thick. I briefly browned the chops in a fry pan before glazing them and putting them in the oven. They did not cook up tender. I think they need longer to cook and may benefit by being covered with foil. I don't think I'll try them again; I didn't really like the flavor. Sorry.

I substitued brown and spicy mustard and did not use the fresh lemon juice.  It was very good and my husband liked it.  Although he said it needed something else like may be some onions.  Anyway I'll be making it again

VERY good flavor!! I changed it up a little bit... doubled up the glaze and instead of baking, just brushed it on both sides of the pork chop and cooked on a grill.  Reapplied glaze a few times as I turned them over.  Boyfriend thought these were amazing and ate 3 servings! Served with baked potatoes and corn.  Would definitley make again.  

Next time I would probably try marinating them in the sauce for a bit!

This dish has made its way into our rotation!  
I use 1T dijon mustard and 2T Gulden's brown mustard, bake it at 350 for about 15-20 minutes and then turn on the broiler until the glaze starts sizzling and browning.
I've never found any need for the water in the dish.  All you need is some aluminum foil, a baking sheet and you're done!

I loved the glaze.  This recipe is very easy to prepare.  The only downfall is the cooking time needs to be lengthened.  I had very thin chops and to get them to the appropriate temperature, they took about double the cooking time.

I read the reviews about having to cook these
longer and I did, and ended up with tough meat.
None of the family cared for the strong mustard
flavor.

The blend is delicious.  My husband & I decided we'd probably make the topping and then use it similiar to a marinade on the chops overnite or  throughout the day before cooking.  We could then either bake or barbecue (over natural charcoal [not bicquecs] preferably) prior to eating.

This was pretty much like squirting mustard on pork, I even reduced the amount based on past reviews and added more brown sugar, but it was still terrible.  Plus it took way longer than 20 minutes to cook.  I will not make again.

This recipe had a great flavor but was too dry - I purchased thick chops and butterflied them myself - maybe that was the problem.  Will try them again with a shorter cooking time (I baked for 35 min) and broil them at the end to carmelize the mustard/brown sugar glaze.  Served with baked sweet potatoes - yum!

This was a decent recipe.  It was quick and easy. I think what would have made it better would have been to add some honey to the mixture.

The glaze was easy to make and it tasted great!  I used a George Foreman grill to cook the pork chops instead of the oven.  Great taste!

My parents comments after I made this - "These are very, very, very good!"  They are also easy to prepare.  The only ingredients I added were salt and pepper - which I dashed onto the chops.  In my oven it took quite a bit longer to cook.  I cooked them between 375 and 400 degrees, and it took about 45-50 minutes.  (I cooked 2 chops approx. 1/2" thick each)

I'm rating this a four star due to the simplicity of the recipe.  The flavor was okay.  I seasoned (garlic and onion powder) the chops a little bit before putting on the sauce and if I were to make again I'd put more season on them or try using fresh garlic and onion.  The sauce did not have as much of a tangy mustard flavor that I was expecting.  The sauce is a good place to start with trying out different types of mustard and sweeteners.

Excellent! I was already pan-frying my chops but too many to fit so I was looking for a glaze to try baking the rest.  I wound up making this glaze and doubling the recipe - poured the rest over the fried chops (I like them really crispy).  So good and SO quick and easy!  Here are my tweaks:  I used a coarse-grain brown/yellow mustard, Splenda Brown sugar (half real, half sweetner), and I was out of lemon so I used dill pickle juice to thin out, and to approximate the tartness.   The sweet-sour-tart balance was great- I recommend doubling the recipe and serving the extra at the table.  (ps I have also used Crystal Lite Lemonade as a successful lemon substitute on things like broccoli-and it is great in iced tea.)

These pork chops were pretty good. I first seasoned them with Paula Deen's house seasoning, then I put the mustard glaze on them. I had to cook them for 30 minutes at 325 degrees instead of the 20 minutes listed in the recipe.Next time I will cook them at 350 for the 20 minutes.

OMG! I don't think I have EVER had pork chops that I LOVED sooo much!! I only made small alterations to the recipe- I used spicy brown mustard and splenda brown sugar blend. I also added a chopped shallot. I browned the chops in an oven proof skillet and baked them for 30 minutes at 350. Then I added made extra sauce and thickened it in the pan. I will make this over and over again! Thanks so much for sharing such a phenomanol recipe!! :D

This was much better than I thought it would be.  We did make a couple of changes though.  We did not butterfly the pork chops because we used some that were bone-in and some that were pretty thin.  We browned them before baking for nice color.  We doubled the sauce and did not put water in the pan before baking, it does not need it.  Also just mix the lemon juice into the glaze  instead of sprinkling it over the glaze.  Very good.

Great! I tripled the sauce and put the drippings on my baked potato. I used 2 parts brown sugar, 1 part lemon juice, 1 part regular yellow, and 2 parts dijon mustard. An amazingly flavorful glaze made with everyday condiments. Will try on grilled veggies this summer. Very tasty...

Although I altered this recipe it was still very fast and easy.  I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper, browned the chops in alittle oil. I added carmelized onions and a bit more brown sugar to the mixture.  Placed in oven just long enough to let the sauce bake on because cooking chops in a skillet keeps chops tender. Served with honey glazed carrots, corn on cob, and corn bread.  Will make agian.  Thanks

This is a GREAT recipe, especially for the grill.  Very excellent taste - even for those that don't like mustard all that much.  I just added the lemon juice right into the glaze.  The pork chops take a LOT longer then 20 minutes though, that's for sure.

This was simple & tasted good.  I served it with candied yams & the sauces went well together.  I laughed because my husband's comment was that it was very good, but I should add more mustard next time. Many other reviewers said it was too much mustard.  It just goes to show everyone is different.  It did take longer than 20 minutes to cook for me, too.

I thought this recipe had a good flavor, but I think that the pork chops needed salt and pepper.If I make this again I would bake thease for a while and then finish on broil to carmelize the glaze.

Delicious! I didn't have lemon juice so I used orange juice and the results were fantastic! With the orange juice I did add a little more mustard to balance the taste. Very easy to make.

I guess I made these completely wrong. My oven does cook fast (it's old and we rent) so maybe that was the issue. I did change up the sugar/mustard amounts (good choice). My glaze still came out runny. Oh well, I may try again when we move in a few months.

This is a yummy recipe!  I've been making a similar version for years now.  The only changes I've made is that I add 1/4 tsp ground sage and 1/4 tsp ground thyme to the mustard and lemon juice.  I also prefer a Dijon mustard over regular yellow mustard.  I also caramelize in the broiler when ALMOST done baking (if you completely bake them, they will be overcooked and tough).

I added about 2 tablespoons of honey, and had to cook at 350 for about 35 min and about 3 min on broil to get done, and it turned out very thin and runny! the flavor was really good but would have been better if it had actually came out "glazed" also the meat tasted pretty bland...maybe would have been better marinated. Husband really enjoyed, 3 y.o. son who's really not picky said "this chicken is disgusting!!"

This was quick and tasty...Just what you need when you are a busy mom.  I used thin cut pork chops and did exactly what was recommended by a previous review: I rubbed them with the same seasonings and then poured the sauce over them.  My hubby liked them a lot and the ginger added a good twist.  I used a little too much brown sugar b/c it was a bit sweeter than I would want.  Spicy brown mustard is a must though.

The recipe failed but was soooo tasty that I gave it four stars anyway.  I wondered what other reviewers meant by the glaze "falling off"... and knew once I opened the oven door to see tender but naked chops swimming in an inch and a half of a very thin gravy.  Everyone loved it though, so I think next time I'll try doubling the recipe, using half to marinate overnight.  Then maybe brown in a hot skillet and cover for three-five minutes to cook out the chops' moisture.  Re-glaze with the other half and bake as directed.  I'll let everyone know if that fixes the Melting Glaze Problem.

I followed this recipe but I think it needed more flavour, I liked it but I will do it again and add more salt to the pork chops and more sugar.

I would definitely recommend these to anyone!  Instead of following the recipe when I cooked it, I just placed my chops in a greased baking dish and poured half of the sauce over them, covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes at 350.  Then I turned the chops over and put the remaining sauce on each chop and bake uncovered for 30 more minutes at 350.

Very good quick meal. I only used on big piece of pork chop pounded thin. I salt and peppered before putting on the sauce.  My glaze did fall off, but I am sure it was becasue I didn't change the amount of glaze and it was too much.  The part of the glaze that stayed on was perfect.  I used 1 tbl sweet hot mustard and yellow for the rest. We served it with mashed potatos, green beans and a salad. I would recommend this recipe to others!
Thanks!

A good recipe for chops!  I doubled the glaze, and used brown mustard due to the fact that many reviewers claimed it rolled off the chops.  I also browned chops in frying pan in a little oil before transferring to oven dish...then poured half the glaze over the chops.   I baked for 10 minutes at 350...the glazed rolled off as predicted...then I turned chops every five minutes or so.  I baked for another 25 minutes, then poured the other half of glaze over chops and broiled for 3 minutes.....wonderful! Thanks for such a tasy recipe!  My hubby and son loved them...as did I!!!

Like many other reviewers I, too, cooked these twice as long as the directions indicate. They were not over done. I can see that the glaze could slip off the chops but that was not a problem here. I followed the directions without the lemon juice and these were a hit. Thanks.

Wonderful recipe!!  Thank you so much for posting it!  I got a WOW from my husband and my girls loved it as well!  I browned the chops first because they were bone-in, so I couldn't butterfly them.  Also I had no problems with the glaze sliding off.  Will definitely make again! :)

I don't understand it.  They looked great going in the oven, smelled wonderful while cooking, but...?  They came out really watery; the brown sugar & mustard mixture sort of "slipped off" the chops thus there was no "glaze".  They didn't look very appetizing either.  They tasted okay, but altogether I was really disappointed.  I followed the directions...??? Too bad.  I had really hoped these would be "the bomb".

VERY GOOD and Very Easy.  Used (2)CenterCut Chops (did not butterfly) and cooked for 30-minutes at 325. I had extra glaze. I turned on the broiler, topped each chop with remaining glaze and cooked an additional 2-3 minutes.  Dont know that I would call this a glaze. But unlike some reviewers, there was nothing WATERY about this. While 'sugar' will always melt, it stayed on chops. Used a little more BrownSugar & BrownMustard.  The FreshLemon sprinkled on top adds that extra taste.  And to top it all off, it was easy & the chops looked GREAT.

Made the recipe exactly as written, and had to cook it much longer than stated, and the "glaze" never did become a "glaze", it just stayed very watery.  Big disappointment.

I loved this recipe!  I used whole grain dijon mustard and it made a fabulous sauce.  However, butterfly pork chops are rather thin and can easily be overcooked, which is what happened tonight - not fabulous.  I think the best way to do this recipe would be on the stovetop.  I will update this review when I've tried it out.

Not very good. Needs to be cooked longer than recommended. There was definitely something missing. Pork chops were tough so I covered them with foil and had to cook them about 45 minutes total. Don't think I will try them this way again.

This was an interesting dish,but it had too much mustard taste for both my husband and I. I made Stove Top stuffing to go with it and -applesauce,on the side,helped to calm down the mustard. Don't think I'll try this one again...

Everyone really liked the flavor of these. It was a great change from the norm. I did lessen the amount of mustard to 2 Tbs and used 2 Tbs brown sugar and 1 Tbs of honey mustard. We will continue to make these in our usual rotation of recipes!! Thanks...

The recipe itself was easy, and i liked the glaze. Just not on a pork chop. I think the glaze would be good on ribs or country ham. I, too, altered it a little. I added more brown sugar so that the glaze would be thicker and stick.

I have to agree with the others, this is soo quick and tasty!  My 3 y.o. and DH both really enjoyed it.  I cooked it on 350 for about 30 minutes using center cut boneless chops (thin) and then poured off the sauce and reduced it to make a thicker, richer sauce to top the chops with.  Delicious:)

I love sweet meat glazes, so I really liked this recipe, even though I'm not a fan of pork chops.  My husband, on the other hand, loves pork chops and didn't like these much.  It reminded me of ham glaze, only not quite so sweet.  I think I will make this again, even if it is just for myself.

I was very disappointed with the flavor.  My family tried it, however, refused to eat it so we ordered a pizza.  I really had hopes it would have been good.

This was okay-just missing some zing.  I substituted the regular mustard for dijon mustard with the thought that this would add something to this dish, but I still found it rather bland and the glaze particularly runny.

This was so easy and quick and my family loved it. Though, the second time I made it I added honey and i thought it made it a bit sweeter (which is what i was looking for) either way the Chops were great!

Not bad, just boring.  The "glaze" was very thin, and the flavor didn't stay with the chops.  Probably won't add it to my "make again" file.

Excellent. I had no trouble with the glaze falling off. Every time I cook pork, I make sure to have my meat thermometer near by. Cook pork to 150 degrees. The pork with cook internally until 160 degrees.

Seasoned meat well before adding glazed as suggested previously. Also added water to glaze mix to thin out.This was really good and easy clean up.

It was very tasty and simple to make. I will definitely make this recipe again. Next time I will probably use less water or no water at all, because I had a lot of liquid left on the bottom of the pan.

After reading other postings, I wasn't surprised when my mustard slid off.  I followed the turn several times and there was a nice browning.  I used a cranberry mustard and it had a nice flavor.  Something different from the regular glazed pork chop.  My husband liked it and suggested we have it again.  Thank you.

This didn't turn out as great as I had hoped after reading previous reviews. I used Ben's Sweet & Hot mustard, a favorite of ours and added just a tad more brown sugar which I think made it too sweet. I might try it again with regular mustard. I think I might have added just a bit too much water also. Win some, lose some; trial and error I guess.

these chops have made it on our regular dinner schedule! definately a keeper if you like mustard. the flavour is wonderful. we like our chops cooked more to a medium, so we cook ours for 20 minutes exactly but if you like your chops well done, definately cook for a bit longer. 
try it, try it, try it!!! you won't regret it!

I made this for two and put alittle more brown sugar and mustard. I browned my pork chops before and cooked for 30 minutes. It was quite good. Made with sauteed spinach and sweet potatoes.

I was very disapointed in this recipe. It took WAY longer than 20 mintues (mine took 1 hour and 20 mintues) to bake which made the rest of my dinner turn cold by the time they were done. Flavor wasn't all that great either.

Very tasteful.  Was a huge hit at our house!  I liked it with mashed potatos and corn.

My husband and I loved this recipee.  It is so easy.  I used a little less water and I had to bake mine for 30 min, but they came out great.  (I had bone in chops)  I definitely will make this very quick and easy recipe again.

Didn't like these as well as most glazed pork recipes. I used boneless sirloin pork chops and they were too dry. I will try them again with regular pork chops as I'm sure they needed the fat to keep them moist.

A good, yummy idea for pork. Used Dijon Mustard, which turned out great. I will reduce the baking time next round (butterfly cuts cooked too quickly) and increase the glaze. Big hit in this house.

Not very much flavor, and the glaze ran and didn't really stick to the meat.  Okay, but definitely not my favorite.
