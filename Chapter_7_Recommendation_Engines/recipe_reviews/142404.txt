I liked this recipe, but found that the egg roll wrappers were a little too thick.  I used the thinner spring roll wrappers brushed with egg yolk, and put steak umms, onion, provolone and american cheese in the middle.  This was a great start, but I think the choice of the wrapper makes all the difference.

These. Are. Amazing. I did a few things differently: I added mushrooms, I used Mozerella cheese instead of American, I wrapped them in spring roll wrappers instead of egg roll, and I dipped them in Ranch. They were incredible!!! The Ranch really brought it together, I highly suggest giving it a try!

I made these for a New Years Eve Party and they were absolutely delicious. Every one wanted more. I used provolone cheese and a three pepper/onion blend. I made ahead and reheated before party and they were excellent. I plan on making several to freeze and have on hand. We served ours with ranch dressing to dip them in.

I work at a restaurant who has Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. I absolutely love them and have been looking for a recipe that's similar. I know they won't be exactly the same but i made these tonight and really did not care for them. They were extremely oily. I hate to give a bad review on someone's recipe but I think they would be better if you used thinly sliced ribeye steak. Better luck next time. Sorry.:-(

After reading the comments about greasiness I wonder if you could spray them well and bake in the oven. I have done this with regular eggrolls and it works great.

Used Steak-ums for the meat. Added some onion and mushrooms. Used mexican cheese with jalapenos. Super yummy. Many different ways to change it up.

TIPS:  For the best results; deep fry & ensure oil is at least 350 degrees raising temp as you add more to keep temp at this level; use frying thermometer.  Stuff with your choice crunchy peanut butter, jam, bananas, or other fruit for dessert egg rolls.  For Italian, use "Italian" components; Mexican, same.  By using this method your egg rolls will not come out soggy and oily.  Great recipe for kids & parties.  Must eat immediately, will not hold!

cant rate them for I have not tried them, I will they sound good. Just wanted to comment on a couple of bad reviews for them being oily or greasy. If those people learn to fry by getting oil to proper temp. before cooking they probably would have had a much better experience, dont knock someones recipe cause you cant cook that is your fault not theirs. Thank you...............I gave the recipe 5 stars so not to damage the average

I made this for the first time and everyone loved them! I did make a couple of changes. I used roast beef(deli) and provolone cheese. These were fantastic! Will definitely make again, thanks!

These were delicious! When I made them I added a few things. I added some chopped mushrooms and minced garlic to the onions as they were cooking. While the beef was cooking I seasoned it with some seasoning salt. I also substituted provolone cheese for the American cheese. All in all very tasty!

Though I thought they were somewhat tasty, my family did not like them at all.  I deep fried and they were way too greasy, even after draining.  Perhaps my mistake was thinking they'd be like the ones we had at a restaurant and they were not. Also, much more time consuming to make than the prep time shown on the recipe.

I was actually looking for a recipe for cheeseburger spring rolls that I had tried at an event I recently attended.  I could not find it anywhere- so I substituted 1 lb of ground beef for the steak meat and spring rolls for the egg rolls and wow!  Exactly the delicious taste I remember! Very easy to make and quite a hit with the entire family!

I made these for a super bowl party last year and they were a huge hit!  I added garlic powder and salt and pepper when I was frying the meat to add a little something.  And I made a dipping sauce with mayo and horseradish to go along.  So delish!!

I changed it up a bit. I sauteed onions, garlic and red and green bell pepper(if I had mushrooms I would have used that too), sliced leftover steak and used shredded cheese. It was delicious and so easy! My husbands co-worker was asking for the recipe.

My family thought I was crazy when I first told them what I was making but they were all singing a different song once they tried it.  They were very good.  I need make some changes after reading the reviews.  First of all, I can't have a Cheesesteak without bell peppers so I added chopped green bell peppers to the onions.  After reading a lot of people saying they were very greasy I drained my meat mixture in my strainer.  Then, to make sure I got as much grease as possible; I placed the meat mixture on stacks of papertowels with another stack on top.  Absorbed as much grease as possible.  I then add salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  Glad I did, think they would have been bland without it.  I also used provolone cheese.  I was going to make half with egg roll wrappers and half with spring roll wrappers to decide which one we liked better.  However, my local Asian market only had spring roll wrapper.  They were prefect with the spring roll wrapper, wouldn't think of changing it!!!

I rate this recipe 3 stars as written. I added mushrooms and bell peppers to my meat and I rolled in spring roll wrappers. I also baked them instead of frying. I dipped them in a ketchup/mayo dip and they tasted awesome!

I made these last night, and they were a big hit! I changed a few things; I used thinly sliced select cut steak, seasoned and sauteed on a bed of onions, green & red bell peppers. I heated the oil while rolling the egg rolls.(make sure your oil is extremely hot) I used spring rolls, and the crispness of the thin roll was absolutely delicious. I also used mozzarella as well as provolone and brushed the ends of the roll with egg so it would stick, deep fried it until golden brown.. Served with ketchup and a beer. Amazing!!! Definite keeper!

I'm from Philadelphia and tried almost every famous steak place in the city. So I decided to try these and they did not disappoint. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. This recipe will be a must for game days at home.

These egg rolls are awesome,and for those of you who don't know how to cook,  you have to really drain the grease out of the steam-um's before filling the egg rolls.  I also cut up some green peppers & onion and cooked them until they were soft and tender and added them to the meat prior to rolling in the egg roll wrappers.  My family enjoyed them and I also carried them to work and they were a big hit.  You can use Ketchup or Miracle Whip as a dipping sauce or whatever else you might like to dip them in.

WOW!!!  These were great!!!  My family loved them.  I used egg roll wrappers only because I couldn't find spring roll wrappers.  I deffinately want to find some and try those, I bet they would be even better.  The egg roll wrappers were a little much, but they were still great!!!

Very easy recipe to make.  The only thing I would do differently next time is I would make sure I secured the egg roll wrappers better.  Some of them started to open and then the insides were oil-logged.

This one made me giggle!  I never made egg rolls before and now I think I will try and stuff those wrappers with everything & anything I can get my hands on.  It was sooooo easy.  First with this recipe I added garlic & bell peppers along with some garlic sauce and A1.  I usually add some Pizza sauce but I didn't have any.  I also used two wrappers for each roll and I will defintely be doing that again.  This recipe gave me some inspiration.  IT is a basic recipe that you can easily make yours by adding what you enjoy.

Fantastic!  I made these the way I like my cheesesteaks of course, and I used fresh shaved steak, added pickles and extra cheese.  These are a keeper.

I did not fry them and used chicken cheesesteaks.....just plunked the mix on a toasted roll....the family scarfed em down and was looking for seconds. Chicken cheesesteak is kinda bland....cooking the onion up with it is just what it needed. Instead of dipping in the ketchup I just put the ketchup on the sandwich. Big hit here.

My hubby loves these.  They don't sell frozen steak sandwich meat here, and it was really hard to find a meat to use instead.   I ended up buying about 6 packs of the thin raw beef used for "rouladen" and seasoning it with salt and peper before cutting into strips.  I then put 1 onion, chopped into my slow cooker and topped with the meat and one more chopped onion.  Then added a head of garlic, minced mix with 1/4 cup water and a pkg of beef boulion.  Then I slow cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  Then I drained the juices (saved to make gravy or beef stock for something else) and filled the egg rolls as stated, using cheddar cheese.  Then to cut back on fat I baked them at 350 for about 18 mins.  Good will do again!!

YUM! I used 3 'Philly style' steaks and added the onion, green pepper and a can of sliced mushrooms. I seasoned it with salt pepper, and garlic powder while it was cooking. I used a combo of mozz. and provolone cheeses. this was super fun and different and we all loved them! Served w/ a side of ranch and 'Roasted Onion Mayonnaise' (from this site) for dipping. Will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were really good! Both of my kids, one of which who can be really pick ate them too! Mine didn't turn out greasy at all. I made sure to drain the meat mixture before adding it the wrappers. I did add garlic seasoning, pepper and just a little onion powder. Next time I think I will try adding green peppers and jalapenos to give them a little extra kick!

My local grocery store didn't have egg roll wrappers so I used won-ton wrappers.  Some were ravioli shaped (square), some were triangles, and some were actual won-tons.  No matter what shape they were, they were delicious!!!  I omitted the onion and just used steak and American cheese.  They didn't last long enough to be dipped in ketchup! Will definitely make again!!!

Awesome! Since I added sliced mushrooms to the pan I used a little bit of butter instead of the oil (I think mushrooms taste better in butter). I also added a little garlic, seasoning salt and ground red pepper. I then used mozzarella cheese instead of American. Next time, I might add a little diced green bell pepper or I may use some canned Cheez Whiz like some of corner eats in Philly .

Yummy!  First time making any kind of egg rolls.  Easy to make, kids loved them!  Very filling, I could only eat one and a half.  Kind of oily, maybe I didn't drain them well enough?  Kids say it's a keeper!

These were yummy and very simple to make. You can do so much with them. I followed the recipe exactly this time but next time I want to try using flour tortillas instead of the egg roll wrappers.

These were decent but not great. I would have rated it lower except I couldn’t follow the directions as is since I wasn’t able to find egg roll wraps. I used the spring roll wraps as suggested by others but it just wasn’t very good. They were pretty bland and definitely needed seasoning, and only half of the room even tried them because they looked so bad.  Granted, mine turned out looking nothing like what was in the pictures.  Two of the people who ate them said they really enjoyed them, but very few people had more than a bite.  But I don’t imagine I’ll ever try making these again.

I make these and cook in an air fryer.  They are wonderful, I use ranch dressing to dip in but other then that no change.  You can use any cheese that you like I have even graded the cheese and mixed with the meat.  Great for an appetizer or combine with something else for a meal.

Made these tonight,came out pretty good. Tweeking the recipe slightly. Once I prepared the filling and rolled them up ,I put them in the frig for 15-20 mins. They fried up well , and wasn't oily at all. I actually made two kinds, pastrami and Swiss, and Philly cheese steak. Both were a hit  if I must say. Next time I might add sourcrout to the pastrami with Russian dressing,to give it a Rubin flare...

These were amazing! Only difference is I added some peppers. I would add more cheese, as they dried out a little and wrap the steak around the cheese so it doesn't stick to the wrapper and has a more gooey texture. Overall really great! Served with ketchup as well as sriracha.

I wish I could've found some spring roll wrappers to make this instead but unfortunately, those are hard to come by in the typical grocery store so I stuck with regular egg roll wrappers. These were great. I also tried using the Steak-umms Chicken instead of steak and it was even BETTER! I used cheddar instead of American cheese. Thanks for great recipe!!

I recommend slicing these in half after they come out of the fryer, and then squirting some cheese sauce on them! Gives it a more authentic flavor than just stuffing with sliced cheese. And I wouldn't use american cheese, use cheddar and provolone, or cheddar and Monterrey jack, for a little kick.

I liked this, but would not use the "fake steak"-would take the time to chop some sirlon etc. up.  Added red peppers and onions.  The eggroll wrappers are a little big.  Will make again.

I made these for my son's first birthday.  The theme was sports, so our foods were foods you'd find at a sporting event (we live in Philadelphia).  So I loved the twist on the classic cheesesteak.  They were fabulous!  I couldn't keep the plate stocked fast enough. Everyone was raving about them.  A few tips - make sure your oil is VERY hot.  My first batch came out a little soggy inside because the oil wasn't hot enough.  Also, for a party if you don't fry them ahead of time, you're going to spend a lot of time in front of the stove and not with your guests. These could easily be made ahead of time and then put in the oven for a few minutes to warm up.  SUCH A GREAT RECIPE!

A great idea! I never thought to put 'something else' in an egg roll wrapper.. I sauteed onions & garlic then added the jullienned beef to warm. I used provolone cheese and served them with au jus. So many possibilities.. The men loved them!
