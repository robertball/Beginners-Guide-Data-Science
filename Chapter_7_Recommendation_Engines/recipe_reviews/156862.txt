This is a delicious caramel icing recipe. I used skim milk in place of heavy cream and it didn't seem to make any difference. I also added 2 t vanilla after it cooled a little to give it a rich caramel flavor. Make sure you cool the sauce before beating in the sugar and like others have said make this when you're ready to use it. If it gets too thick just beat it until it's usable. The end result is a thick wonderful icing that I used on a chocolate cake.

Tastes really wonderful but was much too thick. I thinned it with a little water and it was really good on a pumpkin sheet cake:).

instead of brown sugar I have used golden (lighter yellow) sugar. Tip: Start making this only when your baked good is ready to be "iced". I started it too early and it was almost like modeling clay onto my cake that I had made but it is good. Went well with the Holiday spice bread...

This icing is super easy to make and tastes okay but it just doesn't really taste much like caramel. I think next time I'll add vanilla or something. Definitely make it right before you're going to put it on cake. I baked mine in an 8x11 glass dish. When it cooled slightly I poked holes in the cake so the icing would seep down in. I did only use 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and that was plenty.

Yummmm! I used whole milk instead of cream and it worked fine. I added a little more milk and a little less powdered sugar to thin it out to what I consider 'icing' consistency. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the powdered sugar clumped a little on me when I added it. Seems like it calls to add it at the wrong time.

I hate changing recipes but desperate to save a chocolate cake I was taking to a special pot luck gatering that had risen way too high and unevenly I searched for a caramel icing recipe and found this one. I made this using only one cup confectioners and very careful spooned this over my cake after leveling the top. When it cooled I was able to frost with my fluffy chocolate frosting and the result was amazing! It saved my day. It did require two batches of caramel icing but it was well worth it.

The recipe as is was way too thick and lumpy. I added 1/2 cup butter 1/4 cream and about 1/3 cup cream cheese during the mixing process after the caramel had cooled. I used it to frost a Devil's food cake and it was DELICIOUS!

Excellent icing excellent! I found though that two cups of powdered sugar was too much so I make it with less. The last time I used a cup. I have an applesauce cake in the oven now (by Corwynn Darkholme--which is a delightful cake) and I'm going to try the icing again with only half a cup of powdered sugar.

Great flavor. I did use significantly less powdered sugar to get the consistency I wanted. Also the cooking time seems a little optimistic to me. It took me a long time to completely dissolve the sugar. Still I will use this again.

This is the only source I have as of yet so four stars. But I must say I had to use at least a 1/4 c. more half and half. I used it originally as being out of whipping cream. Then I added at least 1 Tbsp. vanilla. However this made it lose the original and wonderful caramel flavor SO... I highly recommend upping the amount of original sugar and butter so as to keep the caramel flavor. Make sure you boil carefully and well or you're gonna get grainy frosting.

Very good simple and versatile. I used it to ice the tops of 2 "Depression Cake" loaves. (I did add about 1 tsp. vanilla and used canned milk.) Next day. made a cinnamon roll glaze by thinning left-over icing with water or milk. It will turn into fudge by using more powdered sugar and pressing into a dish. Thanks.

Too much sweet and not enough flavor. Even my husband who has an incurable sweet tooth said this was too sweet. I used it to ice a pan of brownies and it's good but lacking the caramel flavor we were hoping for.

The icing was ok. I only put in one and a half cups of sugar because it was really sweet even for a powered sugar icing recipe. That made the icing very thin like a glaze so I let it set up before I put it on my cake but it was still runny. It was ok to make in a pinch since I didn't have ingredients for any other kind of frosting but next time I'll look for a different recipe.

Thank you for this easy recipe. Delicious. I modified per other reviews: added 2 t vanilla after mixture cooled and used only 1 cup of powdered sugar. It's perfect and easy. Recipe was enough to ice top of 3 layers and ooze over the sides. I made a yellow cake for a Southern Caramel Cake.

This will be my go-to for caramel icing! I did add vanilla as someone else suggested did cook a couple minutes longer for deeper caramel flavor and ended up adding another cup confectioners sugar to make enough for my needs. But adding cream to smooth and spread was the trick and it is very fudge-like as it cools! Yummy!

As written four stars - you really need about 1/2 to a whole tsp of vanilla to get the true caramel flavor. i added the vanilla just before the powdered sugar after it cooled a bit. This is great on zucchini bread! Would also be good for a 9x13 spice cake but i don't think it would do well icing a layer cake or piped. This recipe dries fast so only make it once you're ready to use it

The first batch of this icing was too hard and not spreadable. I made it again and doubled it. It was much better and I poured it over the first less than desirable version. It tasted great though not quite as caramel-tasting as I had hoped but the bottom layer had become crunchy. The take-away for me was that the recipe should be doubled for a 9 x 13 cake.

Delicious, quick, east and never fails. I love it on a family apple spice cake. It is always a big hit. I also use it for topping on ice cream and to dip apple slices.
