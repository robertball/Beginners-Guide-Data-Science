I followed this recipe exactly, marinating the chicken for about five hours.  It was easy to grill, and we had leftovers for salad the next evening.  This is a dish to be repeated!  Thank you so much, Mazola!

Great recipe! The combination of citrus and herb complimented each other very nicely. I threw everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for about 4 hours. The result was a light, lemony grilled chicken with a hint of basil. This was so easy to put together for a weeknight meal and went great with grilled potatoes and baked tomato slices!

Simply, quick and delicious. What more could you ask? Oh, right - also a hit with the kids! Next time I'll add a bit more salt but it's much better for a recipe to err on the side of caution. It's easy to add a bit after cooking but if the marinade was over salted, you'd be sunk. Looking at the chicken I was afraid this marinade would stick to the grill but I didn't have any problem with that. I did use Mazola (R) corn oil on a paper towel to oil the grate. I usually have used olive oil and I think the Mazola worked better so I'll use that from now on. Easy chicken, potato salad and some fresh green beans. That's mid-June at its best in upstate New York. Thanks Mazola for a great dinner and for your sponsorship of Allrecipes.com.

I made this for a cold chef's salad.   I subbed in dried basil, but otherwise followed the recipe.   I marinated for 45 minutes or so.   This came out perfect and was excellent on the salad.

These should have been for dinner last night, but...........too long to explain.  They ended marinating for 24 hours, and they grilled up beautifully, tender, moist, and just loaded with flavor.  I wish I'd grilled another breast, as this would have made a nice salad tomorrow.  This will be a repeat in this house!

Loved the fresh taste this marinade gave the chicken. Of course, as marinade, ingredients do not have to be exact, but this recipe could have been written in an easier format. The garlic needed is about 2 bulbs and the lemon juice is about the juice from one large lemon or 1 1/2 small. Fresh basil is best but the conversion to dry is 1 tsp dry to 1 tbsp fresh or 1 to 3 dry to fresh and dry works fine. Thanks to others for the suggestion of salad for leftovers. This is a new favorite!

This was delicious!  I marinated for about 3 hours and used thin-sliced chicken breasts and didn't have to pound them flat.  The chicken was very well seasoned and moist.  Loved the combination of lemon and basil.  I did use my stove-top grill pan since we had a snow-covered deck.  I'll definitely do this one in the summer.

Delish. Doubled the marinade. Used fresh lemon juice and 3lbs boneless chicken breast. Excellent! Moist too

i was excited to try this recipe as a i had a fresh bunch of basil ready from my herb garden and very aromatic.  i used all fresh ingredients and followed the recipe and cooked the chicken beautifully but in the end the taste was overwhelmingly lemon, no hint of anything else.

Love this marinade!  So easy and light, just perfect for chicken.  This makes great use of the fresh basil growing in my garden!  The only change I made was I only had bone-in breasts, which turned out moist and tender.  I served them with a pea risotta made in the pressure cooker.  A perfect summer meal to enjoy on the patio.  Thanks, Mazola for a wonderful recipe.

Wow, was I ever surprised! Not being a big fan of grilling boneless, skinless, chicken breasts since they have a tendency to dry out these turned out moist and flavorful.

Excellent. I used all of the ingredients in the marinade, but didn't blend them, and I cooked the chicken on the stovetop.

Used the marinade for my whole chicken before putting it on the grill. I did add 1/2 cup of beer, crushed oregano, and cumin. Let the whole chicken marinade for 2 hours and then split it down the back prior to grilling. Before grilling I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika, more cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper (we like it hot) and put it on the grill and pressed it down with large foil covered brick. Grilled for 10-15 minutes on each side. This was yum!!

Used this marinade on chicken breast tenders for kabobs - YUM! Now, admittedly, I don't do exact measurements on dishes like this, and if 2 garlic cloves are good, 4 or 5 are better, but otherwise I used the ingredients as given. Let the tenders marinate overnight, made the chicken and veggie kabobs between monsoon rains today - very tender, nice flavor.

This was an easy marinade using items I typically have in my kitchen.   I marinated about 6 hours.   The chicken was tender and juicy and we thought it was good, but, not great.  The only element we could taste was the lemon juice.  It was very tart and seemed to be missing something.   I wish it had a stronger basil flavor.  There are so many really good chicken marinades that I probably won't make this again.

I made an extra batch of marinade with about 1 T of lemon and added two dollops of light sour cream for sauce for the fettuccine and added fresh grated pecarino Parmesian.

I marinated the chicken for about an hour and it still had great flavor. I pounded the chicken out thinner so it would soak up the marinade more quickly. The lemon zest really adds a nice zing to it.

This recipe was a hit with my picky hubby, so it's a keeper! The only changes I made were adding extra garlic & omitting the salt (which I always do).  I marinated the chicken overnight & it turned out moist, juicy, & flavorful.

I didn't have any lemon peel and used safflower oil instead of the corn oil, but still turned out great.  I was looking for a recipe that used the basil in my garden and this one did not disappoint.  I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, seemed to be plenty of time.

I used chicken thighs.  They were very tender, but not very lemony.  Maybe marinating longer is the key.  I guess I just assume that if I drag the food processor out from under the cabinet that I would get a more intense dish!

This tasted great! Very flavorful.  I used skinless thighs instead, and dried basil.  It was easy and quick to make.  I will be making it again real soon!

This is a very good, simple chicken recipe.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  It's nothing fancy, but the combination of ingredients is just perfect for a light marinade.  I made it exactly as written and let it marinade for about 3 hours.  I served this with rice pilaf, broccoli, and white wine.  I am looking forward to making this again!  Thanks so much for the easy and healthy recipe!

Love this!  Easy and paleo and W30 compliant.  Made a bunch and froze some marinating breasts.  Just as yummy when we cooked the frozen breasts.

I didn’t follow the recipe exactly. Made a thicker pesto sauce with Parmesan cheese and garlic. Would like to add the lemon peel the next time I try it again. I preseasoned the chicken which also added flavor.

This chicken has a great fresh, light flavor. Leftovers are awesome in a salad or wrap. I marinated overnight though I only add the lemon juice to the last few hours of marinating. I also cooked it on the stovetop, a few minutes on each side. My young boys didn't really like it much, but my husband and I were happy to eat their leftovers - their loss!

This was so easy and so good! I put the salt and added pepper on the chicken prior to marinating, used olive oil instead of corn oil, and only marinated it for about 15 minutes. I cooked them on the stove top rather than a grill, but it still was delicious. I served it with sauteed mushrooms, Parmesan and basil on top and brown rice. Tasty and healthy!

Made the recipe as written,  it was excellent.  Chicken was moist and flavourful.
Served it with corn-on-the-cob and a green salad.  Would definitely make it again.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. I have to agree with another reviewer that it had a strong lemon flavor. My husband and I love lemon so we were fine with it, however when I make it again I will cut down on the lemon and add more basil and garlic. I couldn't taste the basil at all which was a little disappointing since it was fresh basil from my herb garden. Basically it's a good recipe.

This was  a LOT of lemon and not so much basil.  It was edible, and was nice enough on a salad the next day, but as far as marinades go it definitely isn't my favorite.  Will not be making this again.

Excellent marinade!!! Delicious chicken!!! I changed it up a little bit. I used lemon juice from a little lemon bottle, no fresh basil and already minced garlic. Still tasted fantastic! Next time I am going to have to make extra so I can have leftovers to add to my salad for lunch the next day!

I really enjoyed the lemon and basil flavor of this recipe. I will definitely be making this again. 
The cooking time for the chicken was perfect! My chicken turned out moist, but done through. 
The only thing I would change next time is to add about a teaspoon of salt. 1/4 teaspoon was definitely not enough for my taste..
Thanks for posting!

I was not very impressed with the results. I added the required basil and it seemed as if the chicken was drowning in it. Not a big fan...

Pretty good marinade. I only marinated for 30 mins, so the lemon flavor wasn't overpowering - actually it barely came through, so marinating for 1-2 hrs is probably better.

Made this last night for dinner and it was very well-received!  I put it together at 3:30 and we grilled at 6:30.  I made the entire amount of marinade but only had 2 medium-sized chicken breasts. It seemed to be a good amount for that.  I served alongside this mashed potatoes and stir-fried zucchini, mushroom, and julienned carrots which I seasoned with dill and garlic powder.  This marinade is very good - I think I may try this on a firm white fish.

Good taste, needed to cook for longer than recipe called for. Used thighs instead of breasts. Would try again not using thighs.

Delicious. I marinated it all day (about 12 hours) and it was amazingly juicy and flavorful. Next time, I'll add some capers. 

This is perfect for a summer meal.
