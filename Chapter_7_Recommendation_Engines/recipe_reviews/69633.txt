Have made this twice now, once with squash, and once with two peeled and chopped yams.  The first time, I accidentally added an extra can of chick peas, and it was so good, I doubled it again the next time! Also added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and cumin. Beautiful recipe both times, big hit at my house.

If you know me at all, you know I love to cook. If you don’t know me, any of my friends will tell you that I’m pretty good at it. Last night was no exception, if I must say so myself.

TagineIt’s called Tagine. A Tagine is a portable oven used in moroccan cooking. It’s also the name of a dish made from vegetables and meat. I cooked the meat separately this time, but I’m sure it would be terrific in the pot. It’s funny, I’m not really a big vegetable eater and some of the vegetables in this dish are not very appealing to me, but the combination of the vegetables and the spices makes this something special. You have to try it.

Despite the fact that I punched this up with a tablespoon of minced ginger root and about a teaspoon of lemon zest (sauted with the chicken, onions and garlic) and added 1 tsp of tumeric, 1 tsp of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon with the spices, it still tasted rather bland.  The chicken didn't pick up any of the flavors and the garbanzo beans seemed to add texture but no flavor.

I think  next time I'll put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the garlic, onion, ginger and lemon zest for a few hours before starting. 

I did like the butternut squash, though.  It added just enough sweetness.

Very tasty.  Per other reviews, I added half a green pepper, a handful of chopped apricots, and a few dashes of cinnamon, turmeric, and cumin.

I decided to make this dish without the chicken. I'm in love. It was so good. I cannot wait to make it again. I forwarded the recipe to a friend of mine, who wasn't too excited about it, but promised me she would try it. She fell in love too. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

I've made this a few times and think it's great! I've tried it both with the butternut squash, and with sweet potatoes (yams) when I had no squash -- either will work fine. Instead of ground coriander (I don't have any) I use fresh coriander -- cilantro. I chop about 1 1/2T and it gives it a pretty look and great flavor. Last time, I also added 1/2t cumin, as well as 1/4 cup raisins. It has a nice sweet/salty flavor -- would be great with fresh lemon wedges as a garnish, as well. To make it more filling, last time I cooked a couple cups of basmati rice and stirred it in at the last minute... not so soupy, but still a nice consistency, and it goes a bit farther.

This is an incredibly awesome meal!!! If there were more stars I'd rate it higher :) Very easy to do…it has a slightly sweet taste – from the squash I suppose.  I added a dash of cinnamon as they were recommending it in the previous reviews.  It’s soo good over couscous (I cooked couscou with chicken broth to add more flavour)  My husband and children loved it!!  I will definitely be making this again!!!

This dish is hands down one of the best things I've ever tasted!  I served with flatbread instead of couscous at a dinner party and ever one is still raving about it!

I used a can of mixed beans instead of garbanzo beans. I also added some cauliflower. Extra spices I used were: cumin, curry powder, tumeric, cinnamon. These, along with the other spices, I added with the onions in the very beginning, which gave the chicken more flavour. I also added a handful of chopped cilantro before serving.

Yum!  I made the recipe w/o chicken so I used an extra 1/2 can of chickpeas.  Because I only planned to cook it 20 min. I reduced the broth and juice from canned tomatoes to only 1-1/4 cup in total.  I added the spices to the sauteed onions before putting in the rest of the ingredients so they could sautee a minute to get rid of the raw taste.  In addition to 2 t. of ground coriander, I used 1 t. ground cumin, 1/4 t. ground allspice, 1/8 t. 5-spice powder and a generous dash of black pepper.  I reduced the sugar to 2 t. and when I put in the rest of the ingredients, I added 1/4 t. hot paprika instead of cayenne.  I held off on putting in the lemon juice until the last few minutes of cooking.  What a delicious meal!  Thanks, JLJackson.

This recipe was awesome - I have never had better squash in my life.  We used buttercup squash, we added a little cinnamon and cumin and did it without the chicken.  One of the better Tagine recipes.

Delicious!  Added a lot of spices, as the other reviews recommend- 2x garlic, 3x coriander, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp ginger.  I was worried that the increased spices would be too intense, but it was perfect.  I also added prunes (rather than apricots as some suggested) which was very good, although I think next time I'll try it with apricots instead.  My only complaint would be that the chicken is a little dry, which I sort of expected based on the cook time.  I might try browning it a little less next time.  It was still amazing though- my roommate and boyfriend both loved it!  I will definitely be making this again!

This got an enthusiastic thumbs-up from my food-snob husband last night. Like other reviewers, I modified fairly dramatically, and it turned out beautifully. My changes included: 1) definitely needs way more seasoning than the recipe states. Keep adding cumin, turmeric, allspice, ginger, and coriander until it tastes good to you. 2) I substituted pork tenderloin for chicken (happened to have it on hand)- absorbed the flavors well and stayed very tender. 3)Cook longer if you have the time to let all flavors blend and allow yourself to adjust seasoning to taste.   Serve over couscous cooked in broth. We'll be serving this for friends.

I agree that more spices need to be added to make this recipe more authentic.  But if you want a more unique experience you need to get rid of something--your forks.  Eat it like a real Moroccan.    To do this, when you sit at the table visually divide the dish like you would slice a pie.  That imaginary pie wedge in front of you is your claim.  Then tear off a small piece of bread and use your right hand and right hand only to scoop up your portion of the wedge--no double dipping.  When you are finished anyone else can mop up whatever is left.  Real Moroccans leave nothing in the dish.

Wonderful recipe, it's one that I could make without having to go to the market b/c I had everything in the pantry.  I used acorn squash, took advice of other writers and added more coriander and some turmeric, ginger, cumin, apricots and raisins.  Easy to cook, even after a day at the office!

We loved this dish!  I had a small pumpkin that needed to be used, so I substituted that instead of the butternut squash and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  The only thing it needed was a little additional salt, but otherwise it was perfect.  I cooked it in my slow cooker all day on low and it came out perfect.  We'll definitely be adding this to our regular rotation, using whatever kind of orange/yellow squash is available at the time.

This is soooo good!  Very flavorful and aromatic.  My mother, who is very particular and not usually willing to try new foods loved it.  I added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon and curry and a teaspoon of cumin.  Also, I didn't have vegetable broth, so I used chicken broth instead.  I love the fact that you don't have to add extra salt.  The spices really give it such a good flavor, so no extra salt is needed!

Extremely tasty, I will definitely be making this one again. I made this because I had a butternut squash to get rid of, and I was expecting something like a sweet variation of a curry, but this was not like a curry.  The squash ends up having quite a different texture than beans or lentils, it holds together surprisingly well, making the dish quite hearty.  It tastes a bit like pumpkin pie, of course, but the ingredients like garlic and chicken give it a more subtle, complex flavor.

I used tomato soup instead of diced tomatoes (which I didn't have handy), and threw a few extra spices in: a teaspoon of cardamom, and a few sprinkles of cinnamon and tumeric.  I'll probably use a parsnip instead of a carrot next time: it fits the flavor profile better, if not the color profile.

Great recipe! Definitely something I'll make again. Normally Moroccan food has a few more spices in it so I added a tablespoon or so of ras el hanout and it turned out really great. The ras el hanout spice mix recipe I used is on this site (just search ras el hanout in the search box) if you want to add a little more spice to the recipe.

This was very yummy and easy. a great way to use up some veggies. I did increase the spices, as many others suggested: tumeric, 3x corriander, cinnamon, cumin, ginger. I also loved someone suggestion of adding raisens (apricots would've been great, but didn't have any) The raisens were great. I only had ground chicken and that worked good, but I agree with others that you could omit the chicken and increase the garbonzo beans and it would be just as good. Thanks!!

This was amazing!  I have never made tagine but the ingredients looked yummy so I tried it.  I did change the garbonzo beans for 16 bean bag o beans.  I also added apricots, curry, cumin,and a small amount of cinnamon and tumeric.  I will add this to my permanent recipe book! Try it!

OMG!! This stuff if sooo good.  I kept the spirit of the recipe, but I made some substitutions out of necessity and some additions, out of preference. I used boneles, skinless chicken thighs because they were all I had.  Didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used same size can of stewed tomatoes, squished up.  Didn't have any cayenne, so I used 1 tsp. oriental chili/garlic paste.  (I know, it's not Moroccan, but it is made of only chili and garlic and it adds great flavor w/o too much heat)  Used 1/2 a butternut squash and 1/2 a large sweet potato, doubled the garbanzo beans (per other reviewer's suggestion), homemade vegetable broth instead of canned (cheaper and a lot better flavor, too).  My additions: 1 tsp of cumin, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, about 1/4 cup finely chopped pitted prunes and 1 tablespoon fresh minced ginger.  The spices came together in a perfect symphony of scrumptiousness.  Served over plain couscous.  Lots of taste, a little kick of heat.  Very healthy, too.  Great stuff!

I think the rating for this dish is misleading. In reading the reviews, nearly everyone adapted the original recipe quite significantly. As I was unfamiliar with Moraccan food, I followed the recipe to the letter and was disappointed. I found the meal bland and uninteresting. Additional spices of some sort are certainly necessary.

I used two medium-sized sweet potatoes, peeled and diced, in place of the butternut squash. I also added fresh ginger root and some lemon zest, and garnished with cilantro. Yum!

This works very well in the crockpot, too. Quorn tenders make a good substitute for the chicken. I think the flavors worked very nicely without any additions. Next time I may double the recipe and really fill the crockpot.

I asked my mom to put in the chicken broth for me and she dumped in the whole cartion! To compensate, added a little extra spice and it turned out great. It was still very thick, may have been because of the size of my squash, but because of the added broth was probably runnier than it was supposed to be. Despite the fact that this is 6 servings, i ate a good three of them myself!

I actually took everything and threw it all in the crock pot and cooked it on high for 4 hours! I added some cumin, turmeric, garlic salt, cinnamon, etc. and after tasting it, it was just slightly bland so I added some curry powder and a little garlic salt and it came out really good. I'll def. be making this again and the crock pot made it super simple.

This was so good! We took the advise of other readers and made the following changes- substituted 2 sweet potatoes (peeled) for the butternut squash, added golden raisins and 1c of dried apricots, and added white rice (1/2 -1c) during the 30 minute cooking period.  The rice was a great addition because it got nice and crispy while cooking! The raisins and apricots added a good flavor.

Great, easy dish!  I purchased precut squash to save time, and cut it into smaller pieces.  Did not have any coriander so I added dried cilantro, along with a bit of cinn and nutmeg.  Threw in a handful of golden raisins and a couple tbsp of flour at the very end to thicken.  Served over couscous.**ABOUT TO MAKE THIS AGAIN BUT WANTED TO TRY IT IN A SLOW COOKER.  ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO PREPARE?

5 stars with some modification! Added cumin, curry spice, cinnamon and cayenne for a kick.  Also used fresh coriander and lots of it when serving which absolutely made the dish in my opinion.  Husband and I both loved it and it made a huge batch which we enjoyed for several days after!  Served with couscous.

This recipe came out beautifully and wonderfully! I made it in my creuset and first sauteed the onions with salt for 10 minutes and then added the chicken and the cut up garlic, I added in a tablespoon of paprika for color and then after adding in everything else added in an Israeli spice - Hawaijj which is a mixture of tumeric, cumin and nutmeg, I substituted honey for sugar about 3 tablespoons and I roasted the butternut squash seeds and put them back in at the end. I also used half a can of chickpeas, half a butternut squash and half a carrot. My husband loved this!!! It was a beautiful fall dish. I used the remaining carrot and butternut squash to make a bisque. Served this with a side of Israeli couscous - it was perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes to the spices, but it was incredibly flavorful. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I marinated the chicken for a few hours ahead of time (I used lemon zest, lemon juice, fresh grated ginger, chopped garlic, salt, pepper and paprika). For the recipe itself, I used fresh tomato, fresh cilantro, a whole onion, chicken broth, and no chickpeas (I couldn't fit them in the tagine!). I also added some garam masala and extra cayenne pepper. The flavor of this dish was incredible. I cooked everything in my tagine for about an hour and a half. My only problem was that it was difficult to fit everything in the tagine! I used the extra sauce to cook some Israeli cous cous...DELISH! The butternut squash makes this dish. I think next time we will omit the chicken (but add the chickpeas).

Even after adding a couple spices, it still wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.  It was still good though and my kids enjoyed it.  The only changes I made was using chicken broth instead of vegetable, honey instead of sugar, and I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. cumin.  
I think roasting the squash beforehand would make this even better.  I would also double the garbanzo beans next time.

I did what  the other reviewers were saying and added a tsp of cinnamon and cumin. I also end up adding 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. I have already used this recipe for thanksgiving and cooked it with double chickpeas. It got rave reviews. I have cooked it vegetarian style with no chicken (using veggie broth) and with chicken (using chicken broth) I always serve couscous on the side or under the tagine. I find that carrots need to be chopped pretty well to prevent them from being too crunchy by the time the tagine is done cooking. I added a tsp of sage once bc i didn't have coriander and it was just as good. LOVE this recipe. Its already a family favorite.

Absolutely delicious! And simple too. I boiled my chicken chunks in the broth, and then added all of the vegetables and spices to save time. The chicken was tender and flavorful this way. As per other reviews, I added 1 tsp. of cumin and 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. I topped each serving with a handful of fresh cilantro for added color and pizazz.

This was very good! I was surprised because the ingred are simple. The lemon juice gave it a nice flavour and tartness so don't leave it out. I used 3 chicken breast halves, I could have used 4. I used half of a large butternut squash and could have used the whole thing. Don't be shy with the squash or carrots. There is enough broth to support extra additions. And like some other reviewers, I added about a half tsp of cinnamon, ginger, tumeric and cumin. Put over whole wheat couscous. My 3 year olds even liked it! I will be using this recipe regularly!

I have three comments to make on this recipe: 1.  Color - The ingredients are overwhelming orange red.  I added some chopped parsley for contrast.  That can be added as a garnish or in the last five minutes of cooking. 2.  Texture - After about 20 minutes, start checking the squash with a fork (depending on the size of the chunks).  Timing is important as the squash should be tender but don't let it turn to mush.   3.  Flavor - When I made this recipe, the flavor of tomato seemed too strong.  The chicken was bland and more spices were needed.  As the dish is compiled all at once, experiment with seasonings and spices.  I might also marinate the chicken to give it some kick.  I might also try substituting stew meat for texture, color, and alternative flavors.

Don't know where I went wrong but, did not care for this recipe.  Had left over turkey so chopped that and added this to the pan.  Maybe that was the problem.  I added a few more herb's that other reviewer's commented on but, still bland.  Maybe I will try this again.

I was trying to find something to make with BUTTERNUT SQUASH that wasn't a soup and came across this recipe, which was incredibly easy to prepare. We added 1/4 lb. chorizo and omitted the cayenne and served it over quinoa. The next day we heated the left over Tagine and blended in cooked rice, creating a different texture and dish, but with the same delicious flavors.  I recommend this to anyone looking to find another way to use Butternut Squash.

The recipe is great! I had 4 skinless chicken thighs and a large squash (recipe calls for a small one), so I varied it a bit: I browned the thighs (6 min each side), then set them aside on a plate. In the same large pot, I started sauteing the onion and garlic with 1 tsp cumin to release the flavors, then added the broth to de-glaze the pot, scraping up the brown bits before adding everything. I also added a bay leaf, fresh ginger, ground black pepper and dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon. I doubled the broth (the added salt helped the flavors to pop), simmered everything for about 45 mins, and the chicken fell off the bone at the end! I served over rice.

As written, this a a fairly bland recipe but with some easy changes is it excellent.  Per the other reviews, I marinated the cut-up chicken for about two hours in 1 T olive oil, 2 t crushed garlic, 1/8 t (ish) each onion and chili powder, and about 1/4 t lemon zest - dumped that all in the pan, then added another 1 t fresh garlic and 3/4 t or so microplaned fresh ginger.  With the veggies and spices, I added in 3/4 t each cumin, cinnamon, and garam masala.  I only used 1/4 t salt since I used veggie broth in the couscous as well and it was perfect.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was OK. Not much flavour even though I added some Moroccan Spice Mix to the sauce. Probably needs to be cooked in an actual Moroccan Tagine to bring out the flavours.

Surprisingly good (and so healthy!).  Looking at the recipe, I'd expected something bland,
but the flavors of the vegetables came out and the spices, especially the
coriander, blend well to make this a nice course.  Worked well over cous cous.

This recipe was great! I altered it as well. I marinated the chicken for an hour in lemon juice (from a whole lemon), 2 minced garlic cloves, and minced ginger. After cooking the chicken I added more garlic and ginger to everything else. I included at least 1 Tbsp of coriander, cumin, and quite a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I also used onion salt instead of regular salt. It was really delicious. I can't wait to try it tomorrow--I know it will be even better after sitting overnight. I'm considering using honey next time instead of sugar...

I would give this more stars if I could. I look forward to fall just to make this with fresh butternut squash. I don't add chicken or the sugar. I also use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Like other reviewers suggested, I usually add some cumin and raisins. I've also made this with sweet potatoes in addition to the squash. Yum!

I liked this but didn't love it. Have never had Moroccan Tagine, but wanted to make it after watching an episode of Around the World in 80 Plates. ;-) I'm sure that this version would get someone kicked off, but having never had an authentic Tagine, this was good. Easy too. I did think it could use more spices, as it didn't have the bold flavor I was expecting. This is one of the healthier dishes I've made that my husband likes, so I'm making it again just for that reason! I will read through reviews to see what others did to up the spice factor.

This is now a favorite dish for our now healthy food oriented family.  We've made this recipe about 8 times and it has been delicious every time! It is very forgiving so feel free to round up or down as ingredients are available. What we like to do: use dried garbanzo beans that we quick soak, chop everything about the same size, use extra garlic, cook chicken over low-medium heat so it stays extra tender, and add a dash of cinnamon. Plus, we double the recipe so we can freeze a batch for future meals. Truly delicious. Thanks for sharing!!

I thought this was  really good and healthy too. My husband liked it a lot; my young adult daughter not as much. I had no problems with the liquid drying out and it was great over couscous. I don't understand the "blandness" problems - it calls for cayenne pepper, coriander and garlic. You could up the cayenne pepper if you desire.

My husband could not stop raving about this.  It was absolutely delicious.  I made the following changes:  a little extra olive oil; half the garbanzos; chicken broth instead of veggie, and a little less of it (about 10 oz.); added 1/4 tsp. each of cumin and cinnamon; added 1/8 tsp. black pepper; substituted 1 tsp. honey for the sugar.  SO GOOD.

I hate to be the slow one of the bunch, but the recipe doesn't say anything about reducing to a simmer after bringing to a boil.  Are you supposed to BOIL for 30 minutes?  I ended up with hardly any liquid left after 10 minutes, and my veggies were plenty soft after that time as well.  If you're supposed to reduce to a simmer after bringing to a boil, the recipe should indicate that!

Very good, very simple recipe.  I nuked the squash first to make it easier to cut up.  Used my own stewed tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil.  My hubby loved the squash in it.

We just made this recipe, and it was wonderful! Added cinnamon like others suggested, some celery and pears we had lying around. I thought it might need a bit more salt, but ended up loving it as is. Definitely in the rotation!

New favorite! We like to use Italian sausage instead of chicken and adapt the ingredients to whatever we have in the fridge. We went to Morocco recently and loved the food so we add a few extra spices to make it just as flavorful. Makes one fantastic leftover. Serve over couscous rice or nothing at all.

This was really, really good.  I added cinnamon, cumin and a few other spices.  My whole family loved it.  Really filling, very nutritious.  It took me 30 minutes to prep, though - not 15.

The squash WAY  overpowered this dish. I picked the smallest squash in the store, but still should have only used about 1 cup chopped. Spices were a bit bland too, but maybe with less squash they would stand out more.

Doesn't get much healthier than this! I, too, added cumin, turmeric, and celery. Next time i will cut back on the sugar. So nutritious and a nice change of pace from the ordinary. I served this with arcini de pepe pasta.

Totally easy and delicious. Great vegetarian dish, just omit the chicken. I added 1/2 preserved lemon, instead of lemon and salt- perfect!

Maybe I just had an off night, but this was one of the worst meals I have made in many years, and I tossed it all out- which NEVER happens here.  What a waste of butternut squash and chicken.  It would take exponential increases in spices to make this even vaguely Moroccan, I'm afraid.  This one comes out of the recipe box for sure.

This is a great base recipe, but I'm glad I read the reviews before making it and added extra spice. I used organic grassfed ground lamb in place of chicken because it's what I had on hand and I doubled or tripled the coriander and garlic and added cumin, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. I took it easy on the cayenne because I was afraid it would get too spicy, but I now regret that. I should have added at least half a teaspoon, if not a full teaspoon. Overall, though, it's a great easy-to-make first attempt at a Moroccan stew and I'm adding it to my regular repertoire. Also, I served it over quinoa instead of couscous to increase the healthfulness. Delicious.

We love this. I like to mash the squash in the stew and it makes a thick creamy soup like texture. The hardest part of the recipe is cutting the squash. I use a bag of matchstick carrots instead of chopping one. We love the beans. Chicken broth works just as good and I leave out the cayenne and we still love it. This is a great recipe too get out of the same ole' same ole'.

This was so, so good!  I left out the chicken, added a few cups of chopped kale (because I had it on hand), and served it over couscous.  So yummy!  I'm adding it to my rotation.

Other reviewers weren't kidding, as this is fragrant and delicious! I also added raisins (1/2 c or more), and 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each cumin and sweet curry, as I didn't have turmeric. Used the whole package of 3 chicken breasts and a large 28 oz can of tomatoes. It fed 2 adults and a toddler, plus ample leftovers, which is how I like to cook.

I made this last week and it was amazing how it turn out. I use a bit more spices as some of the reviews suggested. I use 1/2ts of turmic powder, 1/2 of cinnamon and 1/2 cumin. I also use mix peans which add it more test to it. thanks for sharing it

Very tastey!  Made just as stated this time.  Next time I will double the chicken (we're big carenvours) and up the carrots to about 4 since we love cooked carrots in our house.  Had a very light flavor that we really enjoyed.  We served over couscous.  YUM!

This was totally awesome! I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I never would have thought of this combination of textures and flavors on my own and this was one of the most delicious things I've ever cooked!

Excellent!!  Very easy to make (except cutting the butternut of course).  Recommend making all of the vegetables consistent size, about the same as the garbanzo beans for the best mix in each bite.  I added cumin and cinnamon as other reviewers have mentioned and it really benefitted from the additional flavor.  Extremely filling, could have halved the recipe and still had leftovers.

This is delicious!  I cooked it in the crock pot so I didn't use any oil.  I used sweet potatoes rather than butternut squash (didn't have any), left out the garbanzo beans (allergy), used chicken broth, left out lemon juice (forgot), added 2 red yukon gold potatoes, and went heavy on additional spices of tumeric, ground coriander and cumin.  I had intended to add dried apricots but forgot.  I served it over spinach couscous with homemade whole wheat pita bread.  I wish I had had fresh cilantro as that would have made a perfect garnish.

My family loves this dish. Even my very young children gobble it up. I've tried it with both yams and squash and have liked it equally. It had a nice sweet flavour. I have used some of the recommendations from others - namely adding ginger and using yams and have never felt the dish was bland.

This recipe was a great starting point, although I did make some changes/additions after reading other reviews. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced (it was what I had on hand), doubled the onion, and substituted sweet potato for the squash. I also added curry, cumin and cinnamon (which I think made it a little more Indian, but still really good), and put the spices in while I was cooking the chicken. It was even better the next day after the flavors had a chance to meld! Will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe. I found it had great flavor and smelled great while cooking. I made it a little different from the original recipe. I didn't have coriander so I used cumin, cinnamon and a bit of curry. I was really impressed.

Although my version is so far removed from the original that it is probably unrecognisable...I still think this would have been a great recipe.  It was certainly great to build upon!  I omitted the chicken, added some cubed new potatoes, green pepper, and dried apricots, I used honey instead of sugar, lime instead of lemon, canned pumpkin puree instead of the squash and I also added some ginger and a hefty sprinkling of cinnamon.
Sounds like a mess, right?  Nope!
It was excellent on top of some olive oil and roasted garlic couscous and will make fabulous leftovers.
Thanks for this recipes to use as a base!

I made this with sweet potatoes in place of squash. The chicken seemed superfluous, the next time I make it, I think I will just omit it.

I came across this recipe somehow and wow, I'm glad I did!  I had never prepared or eaten this type of cuisine, but just reading the recipe I could tell that it could be terrific.  My wife and two boys (ages 3 and 4) LOVED it!  I doubled the recipe and used sweet potatoes instead of squash.  There were some leftovers but those got eaten the next day for lunch.

tasted yummy vegetarian style! I added lentils and a yellow pepper to beef it up a little. my husband prefered eating it straight up without a grain. I would add more spices to give it a little extra umph.

This was great, and super easy. The flavor was great, and it was beautiful. I will add a bit more cayenne next time, I could have used more heat. I served it over couscous, but I would use rice next time.

This was pretty good. I threw everything in a crockpot and cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours. Definitely gets stars for being healthy! The sodium is pretty high, though.

Made exactly as written.  (My pet peeve is when people change things and then leave less than 5 stars!!!) This was absolutely delicious, and a huge hit with my husband too.  I plan to make it again in a few days. Served it with a side of flat bread.  Mmmmmm

I thought this recipe was excellent and so did my guests and young kids.  I served it over brown basmati rice since it was good enough to be a one dish meal.  I only gave it four stars because I leaned heavily on all the suggestions.  For example, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, chili seasoning, turmeric, etc.  I also let the chicken sit in the onion, lemon, garlic marinade for about two hours (because I had the time).  My number one recommendation is to serve this in a shallow bowl because my guests were struggling to get the delicious sauce off their plate with a fork.  That was my only dilemma!  Will make again and again!

It was quite bland I thought. Husband thought it was good. Kids didn't like it at all. I will try adding cumin next time.
I also added flour to thicken up the sauce.

Excellent dish.  My wife loved it.  Like other reviewers I added cumin, turmeric, and cinnamon.

Very good! My husband and daughter raved over it. I left out the sugar and Garbonzo beans, added some diced green chilis and cauliflower, and thickened it with cornstarch. We ate it as-is but, we all decided that it would still be better if it was served over rice or something. Very Diabetic friendly recipe!

I noticed that several people gave this a lower rating after they added a lot of other spices.  Sometimes simplicity is best, and this recipe as is has a wonderful flavor.  The addition of a dash of cinnamon is good.  Either way this is a great dish.

The recipe was excellent!  Possibly one of the best dishes I have ever prepared.  I initially planned to do it in my tajine, but unfortunately learned my new oven isn't tall enough and had to revert to stovetop preparation.  I doubled the garlic, tumeric, and corriander and used maybe 1-1.5 teaspoons of cayenne pepper.  Also, I used two shallots instead of onions.  My husband and I LOVED it and will absolutely make it again for friends!

I will make this again...and again...and again!  

Like most other reviewers, I added my own flair.  I cooked the chicken, onion, and garlic with about 1 tsp of each: curry, turmeric, cinammon, and cumin.  I also added a splash of lemon juice.  I didn't have any garbanzo beans, so I used a can of great northern beans.  I also didn't have any carrots, so that ingredient was left out.  Once all ingredients were together in the pot, I added a dash of ground ginger.  This was served over couscous and garnished with chopped cilantro.  It looked beautiful and very appetizing; I wish I would have snapped a picture!  This will be on my stovetop again soon, although I may tweak the recipe and its ingredients once more to make it extra wonderful.

I had to make some modifications because of what I had on hand. Sweet pototoes instead of butternut squash, light red kidney beans and great northern beans as well as garbanzos because I had no chicken. I added generous shakes of cinnamon and cumin, as well as greshly-ground mixed peppercorns. I added raisins as well. I thought it was quite good, and it's a pretty adaptable recipe. I'll make it again.

Delicious! I threw the ingredients into the crockpot (chicken cut in chunks but still frozen), let it go for about 8 hours, and served it up with brown rice.


Modifications:


I used kabocha squash because it was what I had on hand. I also threw in 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp cumin per other reviewers. I added 1.5 cups of leftover cooked white kidney beans too, because why not.

I was a little tentative to make this recipe but  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  I served it over brown rice.  Pleasing my family is no easy feat but everyone raved about this meal!  I'll probably double the tomatoes next time.   An absolute keeper in my recipe box!

Absolutely awesome! And I am not a huge garbanzo bean fan (unless it is in hummus!).  The whole family loved it.  All I did was add some extra spices (cinnamon, cumin, curry) & used chicken broth because I didn't have the vegetable broth on hand.

This is an absolute winner at home!

Like others I did add cinnamon and cumin to the spices and used fresh cilantro (you can never have enough cilantro/coriander in a moroccan dish!). I didn't have raisins or apricots on hand so I tried cranberries. It came out yummy.

I had never eaten butternut squash prior to making this recipe.  I'm in LOVE!!!  Super excited to try out other recipes with it now.  I did leave out the garbanzo beans and carrots b/c I didn't have them and substituted with a sweet potato instead.  Turned out AWESOME!!!

Delicious!  Per suggestion, I added a few shakes of cinnamon and an equivalent amount of cumin to balance the coriander.  Had some dried dates on hand (from my last lamb tagine), and tossed those in.  They really added another level of flavor and I suggest it.  Served over brown rice, and hubs was glad there were leftovers!

What a disappointment! The dish is blend, tastes kind of thrown together. To me it seems that it lacks some herbs, maybe parsley or cilantro. Without any modification it is just a concoction.

It doesn't sound like much, but this is a beautiful recipe. The colors and flavors are gorgeous. I multiplied the recipe 6x for 40 (5x for a meat recipe and 1 separate vegetarian version) - not hard! Following the advice of others, we marinated the chicken breasts in lemon juice, salt, pepper, and Old Bay spice beforehand; cut the onion and sugar down a bit, and punched the flavor up with a few teaspoons of cinnamon, cumin and ginger. The squash we bought were huge and the 6x recipe called for 6 small squash; we ended up using 2 large ones. Served with plain bread. Very filling and easy - both the meat and the veg versions; a huge hit. Thick enough to not need the couscous.

I liked the combination of butternut squash, garbanzo beans, and tomatoes, but overall it was a little bland and too dry to serve over couscous or rice.

Brilliant!

I roasted sweet potato then mixed it it (it breaks up when stewing and makes it sort of creamy without the cream, divine!)

Toasted flaked almonds sprinkled over the top with raita and spiced couscous really makes it.

I like spice so as suggested by another reviewer;

 "I added tablespoon or so of ras el hanout and it turned out really great. The ras el hanout spice mix recipe I used is on this site (just search ras el hanout in the search box)."

Will be making again!

Soooo good.  I made the version sans chicken and it was excellent.  My only complaint is that the aftertaste was a bit too strong in the "canned tomato" department, so next time I might just skip it and chop up a few fresh tomatoes.  We used more squash than was called for, and it still worked well.

Made it ALMOST exactly as written-- only used pre-cooked chicken (added after the first step, with the rest of the ingredients). Also added a couple of dashes of cinnamon (as per other suggestions). It was SO good and fun to have some slightly different flavors from our normal quasi-american cuisine; yet close enough to familiar that everyone liked it.  This one is going on my dinner rotation list for sure!

Excellent recipe!  I would have given it 5 stars, but I made some changes  so felt I couldn't really.   For those who don't think the chicken adds much, try using boneless skinless chicken thighs instead.  I used sweet potatoes instead of squash.   Added about 1/4 cup of golden raisins (yummy!).  1/4 tsp each cayenne, cinnamon and allspice, also 1/2 tsp cumin in addition to the 1 tsp coriander.     Also, I let this cook quite a bit longer (sweet potatoes take longer to cook from raw?), and I wanted to reduce the liquid more anyway.    Results are absolutely delicious and healthy, and it tastes even better the next day!   Next time I will double the recipe for sure.

Wow, this stuff is great! Someone else shared this recipe, and I didn't get around to making it for a while; it sounded good, but not outstanding. I was wrong - it is outstanding!! I served it with white rice cooked in chicken broth, which was a nice balance to the chicken broth base in the tagine.

Family LOVED this!!! I did add a handful of raisins about 5 to 10 minutes before serving. I also served it with the couscous recipe from the Roasted Curried Chicken with Couscous on this site. It worked very well together.

This was a wonderful, hearty, and healthy meal.  We added cinnamon, cumin, and substituted sweet potatoes for the squash due to availability.  Overall, it was very flavorful:  sweet, tangy, and a hint spice.

This was delicious but I made a few modifications to make it 5 stars... I added about 3 tablespoons of tomato paste to give the stew more body. I also added some allspice, curry powder, and cumin. Great healthy meal!

This truly is good Mediterranean comfort food.  It won't go into our routine rotation because of squash prep. Will save it for a day when a nice butternut catches my eye in the market.   We will also spice it up a bit more next time.

i really liked this recipe.  i omitted the chicken and added cumin, turmeric and a pinch of cinnamon.  i would add more cayenne next time.  and less lemon juice.  i took the leftovers and heated them up with cooked white rice and added a little veggie broth and frozen peas.  it made an AMAZING pilaf.  i will definitely make this again.

This was awesome!!!  Like the others, I spiced it up a bit, cooked it with a whole cinnamon stick, added cumin, ginger and extra red pepper.  Would actually be grand without the chicken at all!  next time I will make it as a Vegetarian meal.

This is a really nice dish - my husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  I doubled the recipe because I had a 2-lb. container of pre-cut squash (I don't recommend using pre-cut squash unless you buy it very fresh and use it immediately).  This was quite a change from the lamb tagine (from this site) that I made recently, that was very spicy.  This one qualifies as a nice comfort food.  The only negative about the recipe is that even with pre-cut squash, it took me far more than 15 minutes to put the dish together.  We will be making this again.  Thanks for a really nice recipe.

I fixed this today and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I omitted the chicken and didn't have a carrot.  I added a smidgen of cinnimon as someone suggested.  Next time I will add a tiny bit more cayenne pepper.  Definately will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I too had to use sweet potatoes for the butternut squash because my store was out. It was quicker because the squash is so hard to peel. I served with quinoa for the added nutrition and it was DELICIOUS. I had to buy corriander and I think that really made the dish. Didn't know how good that herb is!!!did add a touch of cinnamon. Oh, and I'm not crazy about chick peas and almost left them out, glad I didn't. This is all around good stuff and good for you. Bet the leftovers will be even better! Liked the idea of someone adding dried apricots. Either way, try this! Just use a big pan!

I was surprised at how tasty this was since I'm not a huge butternut squash fan.  I admit I used chicken broth instead of veg broth and added a little cumin and tumeric.  Very good over couscous and great on a cold night!

Tried with a few modifications....upped to 3 b/s chicken breasts, 4 cloves garlic, 2 carrots, used chicken broth instead of veggie broth....was very good, could have used a bit more seasoning.  I found it took closer to 45 minutes for the vegetables to be tender....but we really enjoyed the flavor blend, my family now likes butternut squash!

I used chicken breast and it was way too dry. I also put in peas instead of egg plant but that i think added to the sweetness which i thought was a little too much.

I don't think I've ever eaten butternut squash before, and with all the other vegetables in this dish I didn't think the kids would enjoy this dish.  I thought it was fantastic and as my teenager son's friends came down to try it, and came back for seconds I was pretty sure I was on to something!

This was pretty good. I left out the chicken (which was not missed) and added a teaspoon each of cumin, and cinnamon. I think I added more lemon juice than calledfor too. I will for sure make it again, but I think it will put less sugar in - I think the butternut squash was plenty sweet.

I made several changes to this recipe.  I left out the chicken, substituted one leek for the onion, used agave syrup instead of sugar, and added 1 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of turmeric, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I added all the spices at the beginning with the olive oil, garlic, and leeks.  It was incredibly delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.

This was a quick, healthy, and super tasty meal. Perfect for a cold night. I was out of coriander and used curry in it's place and it worked out perfectly. My boyfriend can be very picky and even he loved it. I doubled the onion and garlic. Next time I would add even more onion and garlic and maybe more tomato and chickpeas too. Will become a regular at my house.

Wow, this was delicious!  I was rather skeptical, but I loved it.  If I hadn't made some changes though, I probably would have given it 4 stars (it would've been bland).   Aside from cutting up the veggies (dang butternut squash!) it was pretty easy to prepare, too.  Like many others, I added some extra seasonings.  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp turmeric, and 1 tsp cumin.  I also added a full extra can of chicken broth because my vegetables were barely covered with just one can (I had  rather large butternut squash and carrot though).  I would probably do extra chicken next time, because the chicken tasted so good.

EXCELLENT!  This was a wonderful dish!  My TWO-YEAR-OLD ate it!  I couldn't believe it!  I will add pictures of him cowing down!  Someone suggested to add cinnamon, which I did, but will NOT do next time.  Even though I only added a dash, I felt like it overpowered the whole dish.  This was really a fantastic dinner and I am so happy to have found this recipe!  Thank you!

I was very skeptical about making this dish - it seemed so vegetable-heavy, that I wasn't sure how the flavors would be.  Boy, was I wrong!  This got rave reviews at a dinner party I held.  I made mine with a few modifications...  For extra spice and middle eastern flair, I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp dried red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp turmeric, and a dash of ground ginger.  I substituted diced yams for the squash since I didn't have any on hand, and diced tomatoes with mild green chiles since that's what was in my pantry.  Also, I cooked this in the crock pot while I was at work.  I put the raw yams at the bottom, and then layered in the rest of the veggies, raw cut up chicken, and sauteed garlic and onion.  I mixed my spices into the broth, and then poured over the top.  All of this was simmered on low for about 5 hours, but it was cooked through in about 3.  I served this over couscous with a side of pita.  YUM!

This was a great recipe.  It was a great way to introduce a new flavor to my small children.  There was enough of traditional flavors (like carrots) to keep them from being scared off.  We all enjoyed it.

Outstanding. Agree with other reviewers re: adding extra spices (cinnamon, ginger, turmeric). Instead of the tablespoon of lemon juice, I added a lemon, sliced very thin. You can eat the lemon once it has cooked in the stew -- the skin becomes very delicate and has a lot of flavor. Try it.

it was okay but not great. More of a soup than a stew, but I loved the chickpeas.  I will make it again, but not very often.

This was a tasty change of pace. To make this more exotic I added 1 tsp. each of cumin and turmeric, 1/2 t. of cinnamon, and 1/4 cup dried apricots. I substituted the canned tomatoes with a large tomato finely diced. This is fabulous over couscous.

This is a delicious recipe, although I tweaked it a bit to make it more like my favorite restaurant tagine.  I left out the chicken and the tomatoes, doubled the chickpeas, replaced the squash with sweet potato and regular potato, and threw in more carrots.  Served over whole wheat couscous (cooked in veggie broth), this is a simple, hearty, healthy dish that vegetarians and vegans can love!

This was excellent. I made the vegetarian version, using 2 cans of garbanzo beans instead of one. I also skipped the recommended spices and seasoned it with ras al hanout, a Moroccan spice blend. The ras al hanout gave it a rich, complex flavor. This was a great easy, inexpensive and healthy meal.

Well, I don't know what a "Tagine" is supposed to taste like, which is why I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 3.  Personally I wasn't crazy about this recipe; although the tastes were okay I wasn't crazy about the TEXTURES of these foods mixed.

This was not the best Moroccan recipe I have ever tried.  It was not very spicy or flavorful.  I added cinnamon and it was a lot better.  If you like a chicken and vegetable stew with mild flavor, this might be to your liking.  Of course, this must be served over cous-cous for the full effect and satiety.

Excellent!  I've made this several times now and LOVE it.  Cook just until the squash is softened, add the garbanzo beans last.  One of my favorite recipes for sure, and very easy.

This is a great recipe -- takes a while to prepare, but it's not difficult. I added a bit more cayenne because my husband prefers things spicier and it was wonderful. Couscous goes great with this. I just used a boxed couscous that took 5 mins to prepare.

I made this recipe without the chicken but otherwise as stated.  As the other reviewers mentioned, it seemed quite bland.  In addition, it was very soupy.  I like the combination of squash, beans & tomatoes.  Next time, I will increase the amount of seasoning and decrease the liquid.

It smells as good as it looks, and it's very easy to prepare. I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, cumin seed (to taste), and canned apricots. Five minutes before the food was done, I added slivered almonds. I served it with couscous. My husband liked it so much, he called me an "evil genius".

Excellent dish. The second time I made it,I added a cup of diced apricots to make it sweeter. But the original recipe is wonderful.  This combination of seasonings is exotic and delicious.  This will be a regular meal at our house.

I thought this recipe was excellent. My 3 and 5 year old even ate it up! The only changes I made was to season the chicken with some cumin, tumeric, cinnamon, salt and pepper and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I served it with couscous. I will definitely be making this again!

This is delicious, a perfect blend of flavors and very healthy!  I added cinnamon and ground ginger (didn't have fresh) as other reviewers mentioned. Next time I will add an extra chicken breast, the recipe is fine as-is, but I try to take in a lot of protein. I would also consider making the vegetarian version but would add 2 cans of chickpeas instead of one to maintain the consistency. Goes well over whole wheat couscous cooked with chicken broth.

I tried this recipe last night and my family loved it. I stuck to the original recipe except for a few things:
-added chicken broth instead of vegetable broth - added a good big dash of Natures Seasoning to the skillet when sauteing the chicken/onion/garlic mixture -add a little extra garlic -instead of butternut squash, i used yellow squash - instead of couscous i used gnocci, which i cooked seperately, rinsed well, and then added right to the same skillet and let it simmer a few minutes more.

I used diced fresh tomatoes instead of canned and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, added a Tbs of cornstarch to thicken it a bit and served it over brown rice and quinoa instead of couscous. It was good, but a little bland. Salt and peppering improved it quite a bit. I googled typical Morrocan spices and found that ginger and cinnamon are common, so I added a pinch of cinnamon and a Tbs grated frozen ginger root to the leftovers, and we liked it a lot better.

This seems to be  Americanized Tangine. It is certainly faster and easier than authentic  tangine, which  has raisins, dried apricots, nuts, ginger, and pickled/preserved lemons.  This was okay, but I prefer the "real," traditional tangine.

We have this on average once every couple of months. O.M.G., we love it! One of the most simple, flavorful dishes to make after a too long day at work. My spouse was raised as a totally meat and potatoes person, so experimentation is not huge on the list.  Risking all, I made this one night about 4 yrs ago and was amazed at the reaction. Thanks so much for posting an alternative to broader horizons!

I made this in the Instapot using 1 lb chicken thighs (per the magazine recipe which has you saute the chicken with the onion and garlic for 4 minutes, then add everything else and cook for 7 min in Instapot).  

For seasoning, I added an additional 1 t cumin, 1 t tumeric, and 1 t cinnamon to the 1 t coriander in the recipe. I also added some dried prunes/apricots to the mix.

I loved this.  It had a stew consistency and didn't need to go over rice but it would be good like that as well.  I added cinnamon and curry - so yummy and flavorful.  I also appreciated what a healthy, low calorie dish this was.  I made it in my crock pot and substituted lentils for the chick peas.  It worked out perfectly.

The whole point of making this dish is to actually use a  "Tagine"... The way it cooks is a slow and direct process, it's just "Moroccan Magic". My husband was born and raised in Casablanca, Morocco ... despite the recipe not calling for a Tagine, it is actually good with small changes ... Of course by using a Tagine ...  Ground cinnamon, cumin spice and pumpkin instead if squash. As a Chef, I  usually experiment with various exotic vegetables and spices ...  Good deal though :)

Great.  I added cardamon, cinnamon, cumin, dried apricots and dried cherries.  I'd probably double the amount of spices an dried fruits to add even more delicious flavor next time. Very good

Used fresh coriander; great addition to the flavour, however the tomatoes were overpowering. Might try making it again with fresh tomatoes.

A very versatile recipe. Some of my modifications:
- don't use the can of tomatoes, increase the broth by 3/4 cup
- use 3-4 carrots instead of the recipe stated 1
- add a couple of handfuls of spinach
- add a chopped sweet potato
- use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth
I have made this many times for various sized groups and have never had bad feedback!! simply delicious!!

Note: the 15 minute prep time is a bit of a stretch. It takes nearly that long alone to peel the butternut squash.

It was pretty good but I added  a few dashes of cinnamon, a teaspoon of cumin, a little turmeric and a handful of raisins. That gave it the punch I thought it needed. I also added about a cup of couscous to the pot as it was all cooking up to thicken it a bit (saved me from having to cook it in a separate pot).

This was pretty good, made exactly as directed although I think I used closer to 4 chicken breasts.  Took longer than 30 minutes for the squash to become tender but both hubby and I enjoyed it over coucous for dinner.  For some reason though I missed how high this is in carbohydrates so as a diabetic, I probably won't be making this again.

I made this with lentils instead of chicken, and it was delicious. I was nervous about the lemon juice, but it was just right. I've made it with sweet potato instead of butternut squash, which is also delicious.

This was really good!  I adjusted a few things; I didn't have garbanzo beans or butternut squash so I just used yams and carrots. Also, I used 3 fresh tomatoes and a modified version of the Ras el hanout spice mix from all recipes (omitted the white pepper, turmeric, and the cloves cause I just didn't have it) and chicken stock instead of veggie broth.  I cooked the chicken, onions, and garlic with half of the spice mix I made which was pleasantly spicy; once browned, I added remaining ingredients and cooked for about 30 mins or so. I cut my carrots n yams small so they would cook faster.  All in all, this was an awesome dish! Even my hunny was impressed!  Will be making this again!

I made this just as directed in the recipe.  The added sugar I found unnecessary, for one thing.  The squash is plenty sweet on its own.  It was also missing a freshness.  Everything looked kind of . . . well, "orange."  Not very appetizing to look at.  Don't think I"ll make this again.

Super easy and really good!  I didn't have chick peas, but I did have a Costco pack of cubed butternut squash and I used the whole package.  I did add a little bit of raisins and it turned out delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this dish because you can do so many different things with it. I like to substitute a yam, and 3 heaping TB of curry powder, 1 TB each of chili powder and cumin, and cayenne pepper to taste. You can stir in a half cup of yogurt, sour cream, or coconut milk to sweeten and thicken it. This makes you look like an amazing cook, with little effort!

Simple, delicious, and best of all, only one pot to clean, yay. My bean hating, carnivore husband even enjoyed this, but requested "more meat". I gladly gave him more of the chicken, as I thoroughly enjoyed it without. I served this over whole wheat couscous. The only substitution I made was chicken broth for the vegetable broth (didn't have any on hand). I'm looking forward to making this again!

This recipe was delicious!!!  Everybody loved it.  I made it exactly as per the recipe.  Next time I will try the little extras everybody suggested.  Definitely will make this again. It was relatively easy, had a nice sweet taste and was very filling.  We served it over rice as we did not have couscous and that was just fine.  Leftovers (not much left however) made a very tasty dinner the second night too.  Yummy!!  And thanks.  :)

This is a great recipe. I gave it 4 stars because I modified the recipe based on the reviews. I used only a small amount of chicken. I thought the chicken was dry and not great. I think this recipe would be awesome with lamb. I used an extra can of chick peas, added a teaspoon of cumin and cinnamon. I agree with others that this dish is actually better the next day. It's really easy and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Good. Added 1tsp each  cinnamon, coriander, red pepper flakes, cumin, moroccan spice mix,  black pepper to onion/garlic saute.  No chicken, but 2 cans chick peas and 1 sweet potato.   Added dried chopped apricots, raisins to whole wheat couscous.  Used 28 oz can tomatoes.   Topped with lemon zest and pomegrante.  No lemon added, just zest.  Very very good with additions, very fragrant.  Sweet, spicy mix was good, could be hotter.

YUMMMMMY!!!
  I took advice from several reviews & this what I came up with: 3x the coriander, 3x the garlic, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon & cumin. I only used 1/2 the chick peas, they really have no purpose in the over all flavor of this dish.

I made this recipe with a tagine.  The instructions were incomplete (even for cooking in a skillet).  The recipe came out bland, despite the fact that I actually added more spices than called for based on other reviews of the recipe.  It was a good recipe to try for my first time using a tagine, but I won't be making it again, at least not without a lot of tweaking.

Made this for a dinner party and the reviews were great! I did make a couple of changes. I added fresh cilantro and parsley about 10 mins before serving (I doubled the recipe, so used 1 bunch cilantro and about 1/2 bunch parsley). I also increased the amount of coriander by about 1/2. It turned out a little soupier than I anticipated (I've only ever made one other tagine it was thicker, so I'm comparing to that), so next time I will reduce the amount of broth. But as I said, I got rave reviews! So will definitely make it again! Thanks so much for sharing this!

pretty bland until I added cinnamon, ginger, fresh parsley, and some crushed red pepper.  I also added chopped kale, which went very well.

Did the veggie version with 1 cup of rehydrated garbanzos and prepared it in my Le Creuset Dutch oven.  Not sure if the volume would support most skillets.  I also added a green pepper and a seeded jalepeno.  Served it with quinoa and blonde lentiles with craisins prepared in a rice cooker.

The texture of the squash and the carrot provides a little surprise for the mouth. It is a great stew. Next time I might double the tomatoes, that is the only thing that may make it better.  Super, flavorful meal, great on a cold day.

I am amazed at the flavor you get from this dish.  Per other reviewers, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and another of cumin.  I also cut out the squash and chickpeas since my husband did not like it.  I think roasted cashews would go very nicely with this dish.  Also next time when I add dates, I'll decrease the sugar.

This needed more spice. I added cumin and that helped. Next time I may add some fresh cilantro and/or parsley.

Absolutely amazing! A great way to eat squash (even for those who don't really like squash)  it's better than a sweet way (like a potato with flavor). My family is not much in to Mediterranean food but they loved it. I had white beans on hand not garbanzo beans it work just fine. Couscous is the best side I used a mild flavored box mix of roasted garlic & olive oil it worked great.

Yum!  Butternut squash is in season and on sale, and this was a delicious way to serv it. Only 4 stars because as written, I think this needs more spices, but I like a lot of flavor. I left out the chicken and added about a teaspoon each of cumin, cinnamon, and garam masala spice mix.  I garnished with cilantro and served over cous cous, and even my husband liked it!

I have made this recipe several times for guests.  It is easy to make and always a hit.  I can spice it up or down depending on who is coming to dinner. The butternut squash is the unexpected ingrediant that makes the whole dish different and delicious.

I have made this dish numerous times. It is delicious with or without the chicken. Don't leave out the carrot, as it seems to add an important flavor component. I use two carrots and a whole onion. If you have a large squash, you can use half of it and freeze the remaining half (cubed) for another time.

I thought it was just okay, as did my boyfriend and father. My mother loved it! We all gave it a 4, she gave it a 5. The sweetness is an acquired taste, and i guess she had the taste for it. Again, we all thought it was good, just not great.

Awesome!  Pretty much followed the recipe, but added a little cinnamon and cumin, per another reviewer.  The tomatoes I used were fire-roasted, which added a nice touch.  Served over quinoa.  Would also be good with cornbread or flatbread.  Would make again.  Could potentially use 1lb of chicken, to feed more people.

This is so gooooood, I used chicken sausage instead of chicken breast, chicken broth instead of vegtable broth and I always add a big bunch of spinach or kale - dried fruit also taste wonderful in here.

I decided to try this recipe on a whim.  It looked interesting and I needed something different to make with chicken.  I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out.  I thought this had a lot of flavor.  It reminded me of a chili with the spicy kick.  My kids put some shredded cheese on top for an added touch.  My family really enjoyed it.  On a cold winters' evening it would be wonderful with a nice loaf of bread.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Yumm! The combination of sweet squash and tangy tomato was  perfect. I'm always looking for flavorful vegetarian recipes, and this hit the spot. We ate this over couscous, just right on a rainy cold evening.

I have home made Ras El Hanout, which is a Morrcan spice recipe from Cooking Light Magazine. It is authentically Morrocan and really makes the Tagine styled stew great tasting! Try adding turnips to the veggie mix some time. Yummy!

Excellent flavor although I changed/added a few things after reading all the reviews.  I mixed chicken, onion & garlic in bag & left to marinate for a few hrs.  I added tbsp. of ginger & curry. I added a tsp. each of cumin, turmeric & cinnamon.  I also used balsamic rice instead of couscous.

This recipe certainly has potential to be a 5 but with all the spices I added, I think without all of them it may have been lacking (did not add anything new that hasn't been mentioned yet).  I was very thankful for listening to GINHUNTER who added apricots, such a good idea- I assume dried which is what I used.  I also used chicken thighs and served this over the pasta "acini de pepe" very delicious!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This is an easy recipe for a college student on the go---I impressed all of my ramen-addicted friends.  Sweet and simple!  I tweaked the spice ratio and added some ginger, with saffron in the couscous.

LOVE this recipe. It is a very forgiving recipe. I actually didn't have a few ingredients but it came out great anyway. I served mine over Quinoa. I made a ton of it the first time and  froze some to take to my Bellydance troupe holiday party. it was a huge hit.   I am currently working on throwing another pot together but again don't have all the ingredients and will have to substitute and improvise. It is still going to be amazing.

Incredible!   What amazing flavor!  We're vegetarian, so i omitted the chicken - and this still had a great consistency and a delicious earthy/sweet flavor.   I did add a bit of cumin and coriander and a bit of cinnamon.   served on couscous.  All i can say is WOW!

This is my 1st time to rate a recipe on here, but I was so happy to have finally found an authentic recipe!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2-3 tbsp of garam masala instead of the coriander.  I also spiced it up a bit more with crushed red peppers & paprika. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome. I left out the chicken, added more cayenne, some cumin, and raisins. Turned out fantastic served with fresh pita! The extra cayenne definitely gave it a nice kick (1 tsp) and 1 tsp cumin kicked up the complexity of the flavor. I was also generous on the garlic and onion.

A new fall/winter favorite.  Wonderful flavor and textures.  Served over couscous.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I may add a little more liquid and mix the couscous in toward the end so it absorbs the flavors.

I normally love these kinds of dishes but for some reason I didn't devour this one. I did substitute sweet potatoes for the squash I wonder if that was the problem.

So fragrant and delicious. Reminds me of the couscous I used to eat while living in southern France. I added about 1 tsp cumin, a dash of cinnamon, and maybe 1/2 tsp of turmeric. Delicious! I think I will take another reviewer's advice and add raisins next time.

This recipe was very easy, and tastes very flavorful! I cooked the entire thing on the stove top in a Dutch oven.  As someone else suggested, I added 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp cinnamon. Serve with Jasmine rice. My husband asks me to make this every week, and the left overs taste even better the next day.

I made this last night and it is fantastic!  I could not get over how delicious it was and my husband agreed.  He was even talking about it this morning....we can't wait for leftovers tonight!  I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and added 2 cans of garbanzo beans and I put 2 large carrots in.  I also addded a lot more cayenne as we like tons of spice and flavor and I did not have corriander so added some fennel seeds which was great and tons of cumin.  I served it over whole wheat cous cous and a little hummus on the side.  By far one of the best recipes I've ever made!

I have never eaten Moroccan food, let alone made any, so this was an experiment that turned out well.  I enjoyed the flavors, and it has been good as leftovers.  I served it with some rice.  You really do need a BIG skillet for this one.

Excellent, flavorful and juicy.  I'm a first time cook and started here and was absolutely delighted.  I did add some chopped dried apricots; and instead of bringing it to a boil in the sauce pan for the full 30 minutes as the directions suggested, I transferred the simmering stew from the pan into a clay pot with cover to finished it off for the last 15 mins. I served the stew on a bed of long grain brown rice.  Really juicy and the sweetness of the added apricots was very distinct!!

This was so good! I'd been wanting to try a moroccan dish and this was a great one to try. I added some other spices that have been suggested...a little tumeric, cumin, and ginger, maybe a half teaspoon of each, and about half of a green bell pepper just because I had it laying around.  My husband and I both loved this stew. The butternut squash was my favorite part!

Thanks for the recipe it was awesome! I am not usually one to adhere to the exact ingredients. I generally use these recipes as a base and modify it to my liking. Here is what I did: I am a vegetarian so I substituted the chicken for "Morning Star chicken strips" which were delicious. I definitely recommend that you do NOT leave out the chicken/veg. chicken part of this recipe. It gives it a good texture. In my little food processor I minced 4 cloves of garlic, 1 WHOLE onion, and 1 red pepper. I sauteed this mixture in olive oil for a few minutes than added the MorningStar chicken strips and some fresh ground ginger. I added a bit of crushed red pepper, a dab of garlic paste, and a splash of both lime and lemon juice. Note: I do not like REALLY sweet food so I omitted the sugar and it was fine. I also purchased pre-cut and pre-peeled ButterNut squash from Trader Joe's so that saved some time, all I had to do was throw it in. I found the squash was taking longer to cook than I thought so I cubed it even smaller and that worked. I also used frozen peas instead of carrots because that's all I had on hand. I did not have Cayenne pepper but the pepper flakes worked just as well and I also added a pinch of curry, dried Cilantro, a tsp. of Garam Masala (as suggested) and a few splashes of a spice I have called "Gardenia". Gardenia spice consists of: Paprika, cumin, chili, ginger, corriander and tumeric. Note: I used additional Cumin as well. Everything else was the same except for t

This was a delicious, chilly night dinner.  We left out the chicken and added ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, and cumin as suggested and it was great.  We didn't have any broth so I simmered carrots and onion in water for a while before starting the recipe.  It was great and even my young children loved it!

This is great...my first experience w/ Moroccan food. I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne to make it spicy, and 1/2 tsp each of cumin and cinnamon. I made it without the chicken and didn't even miss it!

This is an amazing dish! I followed the recipe but then per other reviews, I added in some additional spices (cumin, garam masala, ground ginger, curry powder) and it was fantastic. Paired with some flatbread and the flavors were delicious. I also added some cilantro prior to serving. This dish will now become a staple in my house!

This was great!  I made it for a Moroccan Dinner party and everyone loved it.  I followed the suggestions and added 1T ginger root paste with the garlic.  Then added 1 tsp Tumeric, 1 tsp Cumin and 1/2 tsp Cinnamon with the other spices.  In the last few mins I added a handful of Cilantro.  I omitted the chicken because I was making a side dish - and it was perfect.

This smelt awful cooking and in order to make this taste good enough to eat I had to 'rescue' it by adding so many extra spices etc... that are not in the recipe that I can't rate it well. I made the vegetarian version and felt that the coriander was too overpowering - it would probably be better with fresh coriander. In the end I managed to salvage it enough to eat, but my husband and children didn't like it at all. I won't be making it again.

Very good.  I did add some cumin, coriander, fresh grated ginger, garam masala, and kashmiri masala and rehydrated TVP instead of the chicken.  I also added an overripe banana, strange as it sounds, it added a nice sweetness.

I listened to several suggestions. I added generous amounts of apricots, cumin, all spice and cinnamon. I also subbed yams for squash. I also marinated the chicken in lemon/oil/garlic/salad dressing for two hours (though not sure if that helped). It did taste yummy after those added flavors.

I followed this recipe exactly as is and served with couscous. It was SO DELICIOUS. My 10 month old baby kept signing "more" and ate an entire bowl! Great for a cold, snowy winter's night!

Loved this recipe and so did the family.  Used the advice of some of the other cooks on extra spices.  I used canned tomatoes with peppers added for a little extra zip.  Also tried it with canned yellow squash.  Great recipe!

Great recipe, although for our taste, we added a little extra kick of cayenne. Served it over couscous with green peas added. Yummy!
