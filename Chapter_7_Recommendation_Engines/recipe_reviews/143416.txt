It was just ok. I like lime but this was a little too strong for me. Also lime sorbet was hard to find in the grocery store

Hey Austin; are you sure you're only in eighth grade? Man, you've got more cooking savvy then some adults I know!! This was terrfic, but because I'm not a huge lime person, I used orange sorbet and didn't even need the ice. You're one AMAZING KID! Great job and thanks!!

I made as written and didn't find this to be too sour at all. The problem I had was getting it to blend. Maybe my blender is crappy but there just wasn't enough liquid to get it to crush up the ice. I had to let my sorbet melt to the point it was way too runny and then I had to re-freeze it to get it to that slushy consistency.  This has potential and one I plan to tinker with. And when I say tinker, I mean that I might put in a couple of shots of vodka  to get it to that right consistency. Adult strawberry-lime slushie.....BONUS!
