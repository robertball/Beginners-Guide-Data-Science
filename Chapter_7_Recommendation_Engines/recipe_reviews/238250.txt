This sounded very good to me but, I had same chicken thighs I needed to cook...you guessed it I made with chicken. I cut up and browned it. Then only used 1 cup of barley. added a few spices, 1 tsp. celery salt, basil and 1/2 tsp. garlic and onion powder. It looks great and smells wonderful. It was very easy to put together.  Thanks, Happy Cooking!

No flavour at all, too much barley, not soupy.

Made it , per instructions, and took it to a soup supper. It looks really good and was a popular choice, but was often tossed out and people warned others against taking it. The complaint was that it tasted like spaghetti sauce. I have to agree.

This is a filling simple dish, good for cold nights when you're too busy and want to use the slow cooker. It needed additional salt to bring out the flavor and I had to add quite a bit of extra liquid through the day since the barley soaked it up. Not a favorite, but good enough to make again if all ingredients are on hand.

I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I just used a pasta sauce. Just as good.
