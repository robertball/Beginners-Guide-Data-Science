This is a very nice mix of flavours. It's nice hot or cold or as instructed, reheated. I prefer things less sweet so next time I'll cut down on the sugar a bit, but this is definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you ave's4cooking for this recipe.

Very good, convenient chai. 

I made this pretty much as the recipe stated, only I didn't have fresh ginger, only a frozen root that I microplane for cooking. It was too hard to cut into slices, so I added a little dried ginger powder instead. I should have grated the frozen ginger into the tea, but hindsight is 2020. I like my chai sweet, so I added a splash of honey with the sugar. I also added 1 or 2 more cardamom pods because that's usually my favorite part of the traditional chai spices. I also added a small piece of star anise -- it wasn't even a whole piece, more like a segment --  other recipes have star anise listed and I had it in my spice cupboard. I used twinings english breakfast tea bags, which are pretty robust. 

I made it the night before, strained it in a heat-proof glass dish to chill overnight, and then the next day I reheated in a  big glass measuring cup before pouring into a thermos. I used 1 1/2 cups of the concentrate and about a 1/2 cup of Silk almondmilk.

Flavorwise, I was really pleased with the outcome. It definitely isn't weak, especially with the 10  strong teabags. I was very afraid it was going to be too clove-y or peppery, but I was pleasantly surprised at how it was just enough to clear the nose in a good way.  I wouldn't mind a little more cinnamon, so perhaps I'll add an extra stick next time. I wish I knew the caffeine content because I am definitely feeling a jolt. 10 tea bags, remember? 

Thank you for the recipe.  It was so convenient

This tasted great and comparable to the store bought concentrates and was fun to make. I had to go to a natural food store to buy ginger and whole cardamom pods, and cloves. I would make this again! I served this cold and also sometimes with espresso ice cubes.

I love the combination of spices here! I prefer mine MUCH more spicy, so I probably doubled or tripled the recipe here for the same amount of servings. Also used less vanilla and sugar. Perfection!

Made it in the heat of summer.  Good iced but I think it will be better hot.

Yummy!  Great recipe, I followed a reviewers advice and added turmeric (I only have powder on hand) since my back is killing me right now.  I also added some vanilla bean to the mixture instead of extract. And used one table spoon of sugar in the raw instead of brown sugar.  I also used vanilla creamer.

I know that I like my chai strong and spicy so I did simmer the spices for a few extra minutes and then added the tea leaves. I used loose leaf tea so wasn’t sure how much to add (I added too much. Lol). It’s got a nice flavor to it but not as spicy as I’d like it. I will try simmering the spices a lot longer next time. But this is a pretty good base recipe.

Perfect combination of spices. Great flavor without the bite of other chai. I don't like too spicy chai. This was just right.
It is good made exactly as written though it may be a little too much on the sweet side for some. That would be the only thing I may reduce though adding some milk makes it perfect.
