Made this recipe today.  It is excellent!  I made half a recipe and it is plenty for a few people.  I didn't have cream so i substituted half and half for it and the milk.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and added a little extra jalapeños. Perfect!  Will make this again.

I do not enjoy cooking but enjoy easy-peasy tasty recipes that make people think I know what I’m doing.  I made Shannon’s White Cheese Dip for a work function and received compliments!  That’s a winner in my rule book!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I didn’t want to cut the onion, so I used onion powder.  I also added a pound of browned mild Italian sausage.  It’s a keeper.

This is by far the best Velveeta/Rotel dip I have ever had. I made as directed except that I used all half and half instead of the whipping cream/milk combo because that is what I had on hand. I bet this would be good using the white Velveeta as well. Even my non-loving spinach husband said this was a keeper!

This is so delicious! Will definitely make again. I don't like things to spicy so I omitted the jalapenos. The rotel tomatoes gave it just the right amount of spice for my taste. The only issue I had is it wasn't near done in 2 hours on  low. The cream cheese wasn't melted. I would change to high next time or 4 hours on low

Made it according to the recipe.  I did use one can of original Rotel and one can of hot Rotel and it was a big hit and it was not too spicy! Really good recipe.

We really enjoyed it!  Since the young granddaughters were my primary eaters,  I omitted the spinach.  I will definitely make again and include the spinach.

We left the spinach out since there weren't enough spinach fans.  Will put more onion next time.  It also got thick QUICK.  However, my family loved it so much that it didn't make it to the table anyway!  I will probably make a few adjustments but this is AWESOME!!!  Thanks!

I took this to a work potluck and it disappeared within minutes with everyone raving about how good it was.   The only change I made is instead of 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of milk, I used 1 1/2 cup of half and half because I had that on hand.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  I made it exactly how the recipe is written, and everyone really liked it.  It was very easy to make.  I put all the ingredients in the crock pot, stirred a few times, and that was it.
