This Rocks! I Love a good rub, I added smoked paprika and it gives it even more flavor! This is an all around good rub for everything you need to grill. Thank You LBCook :)

Whoa...hot stuff! I scaled it down to try on a recipe for carrots that used a BBQ rub. I should have followed by instincts and cut down on the cayenne and black pepper. Good but too hot for me. I like spicy, but this left my mouth on fire.
