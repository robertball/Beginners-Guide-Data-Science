This icing is not for a beginner... you have to know how to use a double boiler correctly and don't panic when you add the chocolate that it gets lumpy because the butter smooths everything out... the suggestion to refridgerate and whip it is very good and the icing itself is quite tasty!

Delicious frosting. I used it for the Swiss Chocolate Cake, as recommended. Not overly sweet. I added ~1/3 c. powdered sugar towards the end, b/c I thought it tasted a bit too bitter. I also let the butter come to room temp. before creaming it in a separate bowl, and then adding it to the frosting. I recommend frosting the cake while the frosting is at room temp. After I chilled the frosted cake, the frosting was so stiff I don't know how I would've spread it. It also didn't make *quite* enough to spread between three layers and the top, so next time I may just make it a double layer cake. Also goes great with pecans. This is the first time I've made a frosting that was mainly eggs instead of the powdered sugar + moisture kind. Very delicious, I will definitely make it again.

Turned out excellent!  My husband will eat whatever type of cake I put this on.  When chilled in the fridge and then whipped in the mixer it makes a mousse-like frosting.

I absolutely loved this frosting recipe.  It went perfectly with the torte I made for it and also was terrific for other chocolate cakes.  The texture was superb, smooth and fluffy at the same time.  I would only advise to add a little more chocolate (well, that is if you are a chocoholic like me).

i put this frosting on the marble swirl cake found on this website. i added half a cup of milk to the egg mixture before heating and i substituted the squares with unsweetened cocoa powder and added just a little more butter.the result was a not too sweet, creamy, delicious frosting. i made it for a party and got lots of great feedback, some even wanted the recipe. i will be making this again and again and again.

As someone else said, this is not frosting for a beginner.  You have to continuously  stir and watch it on the stove.  You have to make sure that your eggs don't cook, or else you'll have scrambled eggs in your frosting.  I put mine through a strainer before adding to the chocolate.  Put your eggs and chocolate in your mixing bowl at the same time.  The butter needs to melt, that too can cause lumps.   Then you have to put it in the freezer and wait, wait, wait until it is the proper consistency.    This was tasty, but I'm not sure that it was worth the effort.  It is very rich, so don't put a lot on any cake.

YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!  This was sooooo good.  I don't really like frosting made with just the powdered sugar- this was a delicious alternative!

i was looking for a great recipe for frosting that uses bittersweet chocolate and i didn't have powdered sugar, so this fits the bill. As long as you stir this constantly while cooking in the double boiler, this comes out great. I added just a touch more chocolate and sugar, because I like it rich and sweet. Chilled and then whipped. Great recipe.

"thicken" in the double boiler can have many different interpretations on exactly how thick.  My frosting was very rough textured and didn't taste particularly great either.

This tasted nice but it went lumpy when I thickened the sugar and eggs.
