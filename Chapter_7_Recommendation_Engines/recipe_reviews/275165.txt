I always appreciate a lighter version of any recipe, and this one was very tasty.  As a personal preference I used whole grain Egg Noodles & Heart Healthy soup.  I also added some sliced mushrooms which I had on hand, & b/c we all like them.  My family loved this, and wants to have it often on our "Casserole for Dinner" evenings with a Tossed Salad.  Thank you very much  :-)
