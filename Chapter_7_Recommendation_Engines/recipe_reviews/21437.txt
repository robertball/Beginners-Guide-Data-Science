Everyone I have made this for absolutely loves it!  However, I added several things to the recipe, including fresh minced garlic, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, dried minced onion, more chili powder, ginger and probably anything else on hand.  I also let it sit for a while, for the favors to blend together and the dried spices to infuse the mixture.  But, overall, the easiest peanut sauce to make.  I particularly like rice sticks, chicken and zuchini with it.

Be sure to use organic peanut butter. This recipe can be greatly improved by adding ground cumin ground ginger and increasing the amount of cayenne (although ground dried thai chilis are much better). An entirely different recipe would sautee minced thai chili minced ginger and combine the other ingredients (plus a little more peanut butter) over low heat until melded.

Fantastic!  I was nosing through my spice cabinet and found my curry as I was getting the cayenne.  I tapped in a little, but somehow it came pouring out.  I tasted the sauce with and without curry, and I say for the original recipe...add about 2 tablespoons of curry.  Your mouth will love you.

Well..this was good but not great. I got mixed reactions when I served this. Hubby is not a fan of peanut butter so he kind of turned his nose up at this...and my son thinks it belongs on toast with jelly but was open enough to at least take a bite. I on the other hand thought it was pretty good but needed to be doctored a little. I'll take the advice of others and add some more spices to see if that helps. I served this hot over pasta noodles. Thanks Dee.

This was a wonderful recipe! While I was cooking it my husband told me he can't take the smell any more - he had to eat it now! Then he took into work the next day and a girl used it as a spread on her ham sandwich and she said it was absolutely amazing! I added a little extra water some garlic skipped the lemon juice and substituted the cayenne pepper for a spicier bottled sauce.

Although there may be other peanut sauces that are more complex. At 10pm when you need to make something fast this is it. It's so easy that I whip it up from memory and use it as a pasta sauce. These ingredients are the bare minimum. You don't even need a fridge!

If you like P.B. which we do this sauce is so versatile as you can put it on or add it to so many recipes. Like SPLOTCH79 I added a lot more spices to suit our tastes and used it with stir fried chicken vegies and chinese noodles. The kids loved it!! Thanks Dee!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars WITH the changes I made. I took the advice of many others and added 1/2 tsp ground ginger root 1 crushed clove garlic and pinches of both garlic and onion powder and slightly less soy sauce (I ran out). I used crunchy peanut butter and my fiance says it's the BEST he's ever eaten (we live in the Netherlands and this "satay sauce" is eaten quite regularly so that's a big complement). I also tried adding less water (some reviews said it was 'like watery peanut butter' but I ended up adding the rest of the water because it was so thick! I think the amount in the recipe is perfect). My only other comment would be that the serving size is for 6 people but we ate it with stirfry veggies and we used the entire amount between the two of us. For more than 2 - 4 people I would definitely double this recipe! Delicious will make again and again!

I thought this sauce was alright. I followed the recipe to the T and I thought it just tasted like regular peanut butter thinned out. I will still be looking for the perfect peanut sauce.

MMmmmmmmm. My whole family really enjoyed this sauce. I marinated chicken and tofu(seprately of course!!) in the sauce and added green onions as well. i didn't have any brown sugar so i used white and it still turned out great. I might use a little less soy sauce next time though. I plan to try this sauce for dipping sometime but it would need to be thicker so probably just add more peanut butter. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this. Quick and easy to make with ingredients I had around the house. I added a bit more hot sauce to give it a little more zing but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Definitely a good switch from my usual pasta with pesto or marinara sauce. I'll make this again!

I found this very bland. In fact it pretty much tasted like peanut butter. I even added garlic and extra soy sauce. Will definately keep looking for a new peanut sauce.

I was looking for something quick & easy so I tried this. I didn't care much for it. It tasted too much like plain old peanut butter and I also found it too thick. Even after I thinned it out and spiced it up I didn't care much for it. It's worth noting that I used natural "health food store" peanut butter - maybe that's what made the difference? Personally I would think that would make it better but who knows.

Wowww!! My boyfriend and I LOVED this peanut sauce... Even better than in the restaurants! I followed the recipe to the letter and served it on top of Asian grilled chicken breasts and Jasmine rice. It was so good we even fought over the last spoonfuls of sauce!! Would be great too with fresh spring rolls. It's definitely a keeper..

Easy sauce to make with all ingredients I had in my kitchen! It's become a weekly staple. Make it with tofu broccoli and noodles and it's amazing. I add some garlic when I'm stir frying the tofu.

This is the best with tofu stir fry. It's my boyfriend's favorite vegetarian meal! If using a cheap brand soy I suggest using less since they are generally salty. (1 tsp- 1 1/2 tsp) I usually use double the sauce though for 6 servings. It's just not enough! I find it better than most commercial sauces...

Thick and great I didn't like it at first because I thought it was too strong. I tried it as a coating for baked chicken then added a little more after it was cooked and... Delicious! Thank you!

This actually was awesome--I was desperately trying to whip up some peanut sauce but didn't have enough of the ingredients that would go in a more complicated version so this one was the ticket. I added about a TB of minced garlic and a few TB's of chopped fresh basil as well and that helped out a lot. This can end up being really thick so keep adding lemon juice and water little by little to help thin it. I also added about 2 tsps of rice vinegar to cut some of the peanut flavor. Add more ingredients slowly and keep tasting until you get a consistency and flavor profile that works for you--I like my peanut sauce hot and kind of zesty so that's why I chose those modifications--a good recipe when you need peanut sauce in a pinch for dipping and sauteeing meat and veggies. This makes a lot too so I used it throughout the week as a cooking sauce. P.S. Other users notes about adding cumin and curry are important--those things really help make it too!

The sauce would be fine as is but I wanted more authenticity. So I kept adding until it started to taste like what I wanted.. I omitted lemon juice. subd brown sugar with honey and cane sugar. I used chunky salted peanut butter. Added: chili powder fresh minced garlic coconut oil olive oil peanut oil I used the liquid in my jarred ginger so it was ginger flavored vinegar then a dash more of soy sauce. I did add more sugar. Next time I will make sure to have unsalted peanut butter. I topped with green onions and cilantro. Cooked chicken warmed it up together poured over jasmine rice with mushrooms broccoli and bok choy. Will make again. My kid liked it too.

My daughter was mad when I told her I was making Thai Peanut stir fry for dinner but after tasting it she joked that it was exactly what she had been asking me to make. She loved it!! I made it exactly as the directions said but because we like spice I also added a "pinch" (less than 1/4 tsp.) of Zatarain's concentrated (liquid) Shrimp & Crab Boil to the sauce. I did heat my sauce too which took out the lumpiness that I just couldn't stir out. I served it over cooked spaghetti noodles and added cooked chicken. I was going to add stir-fry vegies too but because my daughter had made a fuss earlier and she had a friend over who I wasn't sure liked vegies either I just served them on the side for my husband and I. Made this along with the "Sweet & Sour Chicken I" recipe from this site as well. LOVED both of them. These were better than restaurant and are definitely good enough to serve to company. We will be making this often!!

"This is superb!" said my husband. and I thought so too. The only thing I would do is cut back on cayene pepper by half if you have small children (or maybe totally cut it out for kids). Only thing I did was add 1/2 tsp. minced garlic and let sauce sit in fridge until I was ready to use. went great over noodles with chicken broccoli and bell peppers. yummy!

Good basic recipe to doctor up according to your personal taste. I double the cayenne use honey instead of brown sugar and rice vinegar instead of lemon juice. I also about 1/4-1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger about 1/4 teaspoon of sesame oil and a couple of pinches of crushed red pepper to make it REALLY hot. Great on stir-fry and/or with ramen noodles so that you don't have to use that seasoning packet with all that sodium and other unhealthy stuff.

I'm sorry but as written this just tastes like watered down peanut butter. Need to up the other flavors add garlic ginger and I saw curry powder suggested by others. Also the serving size is incorrect; I made this to go over rice noodles with steamed baby broccoli florets and matchstick carrots as a side dish and there was barely enough sauce for side dish portions. Oh and it definitely was not 'hot' as the cayenne was smothered by the peanut butter.

This was delicious! I made a recipe like this a few years ago in a culinary class but it took like 2 hours to make. This only took about 5 minutes to make and was just as tasty! Great if you need a quick meal. I tried it over pasta and it was really good. I also added some more peanut butter a smidge more water and some curry powder. Would reccomend to others:)

Very good peanut sauce very versatile. I made this as written and tasted it then added a bit more soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and a bit more cayenne it was delicious. This is a nice base for extra additions of ingredients to suit your tastes. I tossed this with basic spaghetti just to get my boyfriend to try a peanut sauce...LOL. He really enjoyed it. This sauce would be wonderful tossed with a chicken and veggie stir fry over noodles or pasta. This tasted exactly like a peanut sauce I had at a restaurant that was served with chicken. Thanks for sharing:)

I loved this peanut sauce! I went to the store earlier to get some ingredients for a asian chicken peanut dish. I bought a bottled thai peanut sauce opened it... and threw it out... it was so awful. So quickly I went online and found this recipe. I used Jiff Creamy and I added a little extra tsp. of brown sugar... I thought it could've been a bit sweeter. And that may be because of my soy sauce. It was so old that most of liquid evaporated out and I was left with a rather thick(and very salty!) soy syrup... but overall it was the perfect sauce for my peanuty chicken lettuce wraps! I went back to the fridge multiple times throught the night for more!

I love this recipe for many reasons: 1. I have all the ingredients on hand 2. It's super fast & easy to make 3. It tastes great! I like to whip this Hot Peanut Sauce up when I am in a hurry and hungry! I usually put it on top of thin spaghetti noodles and sometimes I will add in some cubed chicken breast. I usually double the sauce recipe and I tend to add a little bit more cayenne because I like the spice. After I take my noodles off of the burner I put the sauce on the warm burner as a way to heat it up a little bit. For me it also makes it easier to mix the sauce because the peanut butter melts down and it gets a little creamy. This sauce is a quick treat that tastes great! The leftovers taste great as well!

This recipe would need a lot of changes for me to make it again. I don't think it's worth the trouble though. It needs more flavors not just spice. Also needs to be thinned down.

Great sauce for quick weeknight meal. It doesn't have the sophistication of recipes using ingredients like lemongrass and coconut milk but it made a nice pasta side dish alternative to mashed potatoes with grilled pork tenderloin.

I used this recipe as a dip for Thai Chicken Balls also from this site and it was so-so. I thought it was to sweet and it was missing something...I'll look for another recipe next time.

This sauce was great. I didn't add cayenne instead I added about a large teaspoonful of red curry paste. I added more water and simmered chicken in the sauce. Very tasty!

As written I would say 4 out of 5 stars. I added 1 tablespoon curry 1 tablespoon chili powder fresh garlic and salt. With those additions 5 stars. A keeper!

Loved it! I added extra cayenne pepper because we like spicier food. This was a great recipe - I used it for shrimp stir-fry which was great but it would've been better with chicken. Definitely a keeper!

Too salty; reduce soy sauce to 1 tablespoon. Consider dark soy sauce (tastes molassesier). Would try again but not strictly by the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Better than bottled sauce. I did what the others suggested and used red curry paste. I put this over roasted back rib pieces after they are cooked and they are a massive hit every time! Just sprinkle on some roasted sesame seeds for that added look!

I'm giving this four stars because it was really good....however...like some other reviewers I guess I used too many ounces of rice noodles (I think I only used 5 ounces or so) and there just wasn't enough peanut sauce to cover everything so instead of a saucy dish it was more gritty. I'll make this again but with less noodles.

I used this recipe as a sauce with rice noodles and cooked vegetables and it was delicious. I skimped on the cayenne pepper but I think I will use more next time. I will defintiely use this recipe again. I think it would be a great marinade for tofu too.

This was a really simple and easy recipe...and worked out GREAT even though I didn't have all the ingredients and made some substitutions. I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce i didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice i didn't have cayenne pepper so I used Franks red hot cayenne pepper sauce. Even with my lack of ingredients and "close" substitutions it still turned out great! I took another reviewers suggestion and added garlic powder onion powder and ground ginger. My family was crazy over this sauce...we saved the leftovers so they can pour it over rice for lunch.:) Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED THIS! I am so excited to find a peanut sauce recipe that is just the right amount of sweet and spicy. Was wonderful on chicken and rice along with teriyaki sauce! Best part? Easy to made and had all of the ingredients on hand. ONLY thing I changed was that I added about a teaspoon of minced garlic!

Very quick and good definately not a criticism but instead of cayenne pepper I used "sambal olek" an Indonesian pepper that you buy in small jars. The reason they are small is because this pepper is about as potent as nitro-glycerine. Use carefully and keep a bit of sugar handy in case you wish to try a quarter of a teaspoon sugar puts out the flame. My kind of tasty easy recipe thanks much

I didn't like this sauce when I tasted it by itself but then I added a bit more peanut butter and served it over rice noodles and was pretty happy with the result. Next time I might try cutting back on the lemon juice and adding a bit of cumin like others suggested.

I agree with the other posts. I had to use A LOT more cayenne pepper. I also added ground ginger and some garlic to the sauce. The base though is a good start and tweaking it to your personal taste completes it. Sauteed some chicken and veggies and served it over brown rice.

This recipe is 4 stars on it own - and it's an excellent base point to start at. I ended up adding minced garlic curry powder more red pepper and quite a bit more soy sauce and peanut butter. It was excellent on whole wheat noodles and on the side with grilled chicken breasts. The kids however were not amused with the fact that I used peanut butter on something other than on bread or in cookies.

I gave this 4 stars as is but would definitely give it 5 stars with one small change: Curry. I add between 1 and 2 tsp. curry powder and it is so good! This is one of my families favorites (and I have young kids). We all love this and don't get tired of it. I put it on Chicken and serve with rice and broccoli.

This is a recipe that I use quite often. It's a great alternative to make from the coconut milk based sauce and it's much easier. I find the sauce has a nicer consistency if you heat it up and bring to a simmer; it comes out a lot smoother.

Excellent base sauce! Just a few mods- added hot garlic sauce because that's all I had and a teaspoon of rice vinegar. I also skipped the lemon juice (by accident) but will try it next time. Overall this was just the sauce I was looking for- great with tofu and veggies. Thanks!

It's great in a stew or stir fry with chicken carrots yellow or red peppers onions and peanuts over rice or mixed with noodles. I also make it to use as a hot pot dipping sauce. My African and Asian friends have all loved it too!

I doubled this recipe and used it in a stir fry to feed four. It was fantastic as written! I made a basic stir fry with chicken garlic onions carrot green beans green peppers and crushed red pepper flakes and then added the sauce and simmered for a few minutes. I served this over rice. With the garlic and red pepper flakes it had a real kick. I loved this recipe because I had everything on hand. Will make again.

I did make the sauce as specified and it was really good but I like spicy food so I added more cayenne garlic and half a jalpeno pepper. Will make again!

Good recipe and easily adaptable to individual taste. I used all natural peanut butter added red pepper flakes and topped with scallions and toasted peanuts. Only thing I did differently was to warm all ingredients in a small pan on the stove to combine. Next time I make this I will add some stir fry veggies. Thanks!

MMM MMM MMM!! So good and such a great consistency. I didn't have regular peanut butter so I used what I had-- one of those new peanut butter and honey mixtures. I also added some ginger paste and a little bit of fresh minced garlic. It was WONDERFUL! I doubled the recipe and poured over pasta with sauteed carrots mushrooms garlic and green onions cooked with some ginger paste and Thai red curry paste. SO GOOD!!

This was good but I doctored it so not a five-star recipe. I followed other reviewer's tips and added more spice.

I didn't really like this recipe but my boyfriend did that's why I gave it 3 stars. I used it to dip in grilled pork. I might try this one again.

I thought this was delicious. I used Saruchi chili sauce for spice instead of Cayenne.

This was good but I wish I had a better idea what 6 servings was before I added it to my 6 ounces of mung bean noodles 1 pound of turkey and 20 florets of broccoli dish. The sauce was simply not enough to coat the noodles thoroughly so while the sauce tasted great the noodles they were supposed to be coating were dry. Then again I love to drench my noodles in peanut sauce. I would recommend doubling the recipe if you're making dinner for more than one person and save any leftovers in the fridge for later. Double the cayenne pepper too if you want more kick.

I mixed this with cooked ramen noodles (without the flavor packet) but I could only eat a little bit. It was too sweet to eat more than that. Maybe I added too much of the sauce to the noodles. I probably won't make again but I will add less sugar if I do.

This was great but I substituted syracha for the cayenne because I wanted some garlic flavour without having to put in raw garlic.

I needed a peanut sauce to toss with cold pasta. This did justice considering I didn't have other recipes' ingredients (rice wine vinegar tamari) on hand. Thanks!

I was trying to mix flavor and frugality and went looking for a recipe that didn't require a lot of shopping. All I had to buy was the soy sauce. It was very easy to prepare and surprisingly my little finicky one who 'no longer likes peanut butter sandwiches' ate all of her noodles. The zucchini we added didn't rate as high on her list unfortunately. One thing I'll say is that the heat of the sauce sort of sneaks up on you very much like the peanut sauce I've had in Thai restaurants state-side.

It was okay...I had a feeling it would be too sweet so I backed off on the brown sugar and added more cayenne. Based on some other reviewers I added a little cumin but it tasted like asian-meets-mexican! What a mistake. I ended up adding way more soy sauce and a ilttle sesame oil and chicken stock to make it thinner. It ended up okay but I will try another recipe next time.

I thought this was just OK as written. After tasting it I added garlic powder ginger more soy sauce and more peanut butter. Was OK then but still not great. Will look for another recipe.

This is a great base to start with for your sauce. I like my sauces to be a lot spicier than this so I followed the suggestions of others and added some red pepper flakes curry powder ginger garlic and red pepper powder. Makes for the PERFECT combination of sweet and spicy!

I used this sauce in another AllRecipes recipe for Pacific Cuban Beans and Rice rather than the purchased peanut sauce the recipe called for. This worked perfectly. I wanted to make my own in order to reduce the calories and fat and it worked. I used PB2 peanut butter powder rather than regular peanut butter and once I got the ratio of powder to water right the consistency was nice and creamy and I didn't miss the extra fat at all. I'll use this again as a quick sauce for rice noodles or for chicken tenders. So easy and it doesn't require cooking. Just mix it up - yay!

This was the best recipe I found for peanut sauce yet. I rated it five stars even though I made a couple of changes. I added tsp of curry powder and used coconut milk instead of hot water I will definitely be using this as my regular peanut sauce recipe as I have yet to find a better or easier one!

This basic recipe needs your personal touch. I added a bit of hoisin sauce crushed garlic a splash of coconut milk. It was perfect! It was a little thick but so yummy.
