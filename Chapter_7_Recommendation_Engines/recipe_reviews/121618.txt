I made these for my son who is a hamburger fiend.  We thought these were wonderful but noted a few problems with the recipe itself.  One - it was hard for me to get the biscuit dough to cook all the way on the bottom - I had to turn them and cook for a few minutes longer than the recipe specified. Two - I had a lot of leftover hamburger even though I used way more than three tablespoons per pocket.  But overall the final product tasted great and gave me some ideas to try next time - like breakfast sausage in place of the hamburger for breakfast on the go.  Also note that these don't reheat well in the microwave, so only make what you can eat at the time, or reheat in the oven.

I liked this recipes but only put the meat, onions and cheese on the inside for baking.  Too many picky eaters at my house.

These were ok, though I wouldn't make them again as is. I made them as is except for I seasoned my hamburger meat with some burger seasoning and ranch powder. Next time, I would not use biscuits, I would use large crescent rolls, and maybe add some bacon crumbles. I would try the biscuits again with sausage,cheese, and egg inside. Also, with using the biscuits, I had the small cans the come in a 4 pack, and used 2 biscuits per pocket, used 2 cans, and still had probably 2/3 of the meat left.

Made these for a quick meal and they turned out pretty well.  I also made a quick thousand island dipping sauce to go with them which was a great addition to the meal.

Love it. I added tomato ketchup to the beef mix. It added a lot of flavor, although, it made them closer to sloppy joes. Next time I think I will try bbq sauce and maybe bacon.

I used pre-made pita-pockets because I had some that needed to be used. My husband and kids loved them..I added bacon on top of the meat, like a bacon cheese burger. They were a bit hit and will definitely be made again!

These were very good. I found that stretching the dough a little bit before placing the meat and cheese in it worked a little bit better for me. That way it had a little more elasticity to it. Overall, a very easy and good dish!

This is a great fast recipe. I found a whole wheat biscuit dough and used a low fat swiss cheese and turkey burger for a healthier option and it worked so well we had them again the next night! I would think you could use frozen bread dough if you were serving a crowd, especially if you like whole wheat. Definitely turn and cook 5 min on the other side. I heated them up the next day in a microwave cooker/wrapper I saved from some pot pies and they came out perfectly.

Had these tonight--wonderful!  All my picky eaters gave it 5 stars.  I used Grands biscuits instead of smaller ones, so it only took 1 biscuit for each pocket. I also did like another reviewer said and flipped them and cooked for another 5 min. Served with fries and was excellent!

Interesting.  I used ground turkey for this recipe and followed the directions to a tee.  Next time I would use less meat than called for, as there was a multitude of hamburger meat left.  I doubled the serving in each pocket, and cooked per the directions.  The bottoms were not fully cooked - so I would flip and cook for an additional 4 minutes to let the bottom of the pocket cook entirely.

This was a hit with my kids!  I used Grands Reduced Fat Wheat biscuits and it turned out really well.  Next time I'll add bacon.  I plan to make these during the school year for my kids to take for their lunches.
