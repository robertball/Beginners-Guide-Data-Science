Wow! Doggie-Daddy asked, "Are we out of food?" and I replied, "Why no!" and quickly searched for a recipe involving orzo et voila! -- this recipe certainly did the trick. It's a keeper. While cooking the smell is wonderful: like hashbrowns (potato is in the mix) and I do declare that Parmesan may be omitted. . . I tasted it before pouring on the cheese and it can really be eaten either way. Also added thai pepper for a touch of heat and didn't have carrots so yes! it's a good base to go on -- orzo, potatoes, onions, garlic, butter are the musts for this taste I think. Only thing though, it took me longer than 30 mins. (the simmering alone is 12 mins.) and there's minced, dicing, peeling involved so I'd say it generally would take about an hour instead... or am I just a turtle. 
Eat it up dudes! Thanks.

I had to add quite a bit of spices and extra garlic but it was a good start to a recipe. I also added the water and boullion with the potatoes as soon as the orzo and garlic was done cooking. Otherwise I think it would have taken longer to cook the potatoes.

I make this quite often.  I love it.
I do add extra garlic but, that's it.  The Italian seasonings and parmesan are a perfect blen.   It's a great side to almost anything.  Company is always impressed.  Thanks for posting!

Not bad...I had no carrots so used peas and frozen kernel corn instead...it is a bit bland though, and I felt the italian seasoning was overpowering. I will make this again, but will omit the thyme and use more oregano and basil.

This is pretty good, definitely a good starting point.  I found it a bit bland, personally, but my family loved it.  (Usually they say things _I_ like are bland :-p)  Adding extra salt, stirring in some crunchy veggies near the end, or adding something spicy such as cayenne could really brighten this dish up.

I changed this up a bit & everyone loved it! Used half butter, half EVOO to start.  After browning orzo & sauteing garlic added onion, brocolli & califlower & a small amt. of frozen peas & sauteed another 5 min.  Added 2 1/2 c. of veggie broth (not water & 1 bullion cube ... too bland) & potatoes. Used fresh oregano & basil in place of dried seasonings. Didn't need even 1/2 c. of parmesan after that, just a sprinkling.  Took 35 minutes start to finish, including chopping.

Great side dish! I had no Italian seasoning and substituted with fenugreek and parsley, but I thought the taste was really nice with a great combination of vegetables with orzo.

My full-blooded Italian husband LOVED this recipe! He has been asking for it repeatedly since. "This is an easy to make authentic, Italian dish with robust flavors and is very addicting."

My husband and I love this one.  I usually increase the carrots, and add a good amount of dried basil.  Make sure to cut the potatoes small or it will take a long time to cook.  We also like a lot of Parmesan for this one.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have vegetable bouillon, so used chicken broth for the liquid.

ehhhh...Didn't do much for me.  Was pretty bland, I forgot to top with Parmesean cheese, but I don't think it would have made much of a difference.  WIth some tweeking, this has the potential to be an awesome recipie, but for now, blah!

This dish was just okay for our family. A little on the bland and mushy side.  I don't think you need to soften the veggies so much before adding the water b/c it was like mashed potatoes with orzo.

Great texture but BLAND. High Altitude changes: we used about 28oz of liquid (1/2 can broth, filling remainder of can in water + 1 addnl can of water). We let simmer longer than recommended (about 20 minutes) and UNCOVERED to make the water cook away.  We could not get the potatoes to get tender before adding the liquids so I'm sure that had something to do with the increased simmering time.  GREAT base recipie.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and I've used it as a side dish with dinner, and added cubed, grilled garlic sausage to leftovers for lunch (really yummy). Definitely not a dish for when you're in a big hurry, but worth the time it took!

This makes a nice change to the regular rice/noodle/mashed potato side dish. I used 2 cups of water, and topped it up with tomato juice - for flavor and a little color - when it needed more fluid. I think this would make a good basis for a stew or gumbo - you could add a couple cans of crushed tomatoes, some sliced kielbasa etc etc. Thanks, Betina!

My husband is not big on starchy side dishes, so when he ate all of this before touching the meat, I knew it was good.  I added Everglades seasoning (obviously a FL product, but you can get it online) and chopped the carrots rather than slicing. Will definitely make again.

This was easy and tasted quite good.  I didn't have orzo pasta or Italian seasoning on hand, so I used penne pasta, dried oregano, and dried basil instead.  It turned out very nice, except that it was slightly soupy (which is to be expected due to my pasta substitution).  As a cheap college student I really appreciated this recipe, and will probably make it again soon.

This is a very good recipe but as a side dish. I wouldn't recommend it as a main dish unless you add chicken to it. But, it was very good. I will be making again but as a side dish. Thanks for the recipe. It adds to any dish.

Great and very simple!

I used two cups curly pasta instead of one cup orzo (same amount of water) and it turned out just fine.
I completely forgot the parmesan cheese too and it was still tasty!

This is a good healthy and hearty meal, the only 'bad' thing in here is the butter!

The texture and overall quaility of this dish was very good!  My only adjustment next time I make it is that I will cut down the Italian Seasoning.  It seemed to over power the other flavors.

Just made this for a contribution to my daughter's school Thanksgiving feast, and it's so hearty I almost think it could be a great main dish with a salad on the side. Smells amazing. Hope I can reheat it and get it out of the office and over to her school without my co-workers pilfering spoonfuls...

my hubby and i love this dish.  we tweak it here and there. i like to toss in some chopped red pepper with the carrot/onion/potato mixture.  the orzo to veggie ratio seems off so we use a little less orzo. thanks for a great recipe!
