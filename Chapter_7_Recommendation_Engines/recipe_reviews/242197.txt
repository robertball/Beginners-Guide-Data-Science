This is a good starting point for a fantastic vinaigrette. As written, I found it needed a few tweaks. It had too much vinegar and not enough sweetness. I ended up adding another 1/4 cup of blueberries which helped a lot. I'd recommend doubling the berries, and only using 1/4-1/3 cup of vinegar. I also found this needed some salt and a touch of fresh black pepper. With the changes, it was delicious! I served this over a simple spinach salad topped with blueberries, sliced strawberries and sliced almonds. Thank you EvilJekyll!

I just made this! so easy. like the others I used less oil and vinegar and doubled up on the blueberries. I decided to not add the sesame seeds I thought it would be too "grainy" for my liking

I've never made salad dressing before and this was my first go.
I also never cook with white vinegar because I use it for a cleaning product.
The reason why I gave it 4 stars was my own error because I believe I may have added too much vinegar! 
I added a teaspoon of honey to bring down the vinegar taste I also cut the ingredients by half because I'm a single person who lives alone so there's no sense in making so much food. It does seem a bit on the early side but again I've never made dressing before and this one seemed like something simple and tasty and it sure is! I will definitely be making this in the future
