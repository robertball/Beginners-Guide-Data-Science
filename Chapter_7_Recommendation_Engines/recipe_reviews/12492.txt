I have now used this recipe in the following recipes: Apple Pie by Grandma Ople (from this website), Perfect Pumpkin Pie (from this website), a broccoli quiche (my mom's recipe), and a spinach and mushroom quiche (also my mom's recipe). This pie crust has been perfect every time, and makes whatever dish it is in a hundred times better. I have adopted this recipe as my everything pie crust recipe.

Good also if you substitute shortening with butter or margarin.

Very good! I added a couple tsp. of white sugar to give it a little extra sweetness. They say the sugar makes the dough stickier and harder to work with and to add confectioners sugar instead, but it seemed to work out fine for me. I used tips from this site and froze the shortening (use butter flavored...great taste!) before cutting it into the flour (it doesn't freeze, it just gets very cold) and I used ICE water. I then refrigerated for 30 minutes prior to rolling out. After I rolled it and placed it in the pan, I refrigerated another 30 minutes before putting my filling in (pumpkin..YUM!). This resulted in a good tasting, flaky crust.

A great pie crust!  I use 1/4 c. shortening and 1/4 c. butter. I also use ice water, one tablespoon at a time.  For a no-bake pie (such as my favorite, fresh strawberry), bake at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes.  For a pie which isn't as sweet, I would also add about 1 tablespoon of sugar to the flour.

This is the first pie crust recipe that I've used where I got consistent results.  I didn't do anything special.  I didn't refrigerate the fat to get it super cold...none of that.  I just followed the recipe word for word and my crust was perfectly flaky.  Thanks!

Wonderful crust! Easy to work with and has a delicious taste. I mixed my dough together then threw it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to allow it to cool. It makes it easier to roll out and keeps it from shrinking when you're trying to make it into a pie shape. This will be my usual pie recipe from now on. Oh, and in case it wasn't clear for you either (maybe it's just me) this makes dough for 1 pie, but not a double crust. If you need a top for apple pie, etc., make a double batch.

Incredible.  The only thing I changed is I used unsalted butter instead of shortening.  Was a breeze and was so good.

Use iced water to make a better pie crust!  I also put it into the fridge for 30 mins after making it to make the pastry easier to work with.

I wouldn't change a thing.  This is a tender and flaky classic pie crust.  The trick is to avoid handling it too much.  Stir in the icy cold water just until the flour is moistened enough to stick together and you'll get a perfect crust every time.  TO BAKE EMPTY PIE SHELL:  Prick bottom of crust thoroughly with fork (40 to 50 times).  Bake in lower third of over at 425 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes,.

I used this crust while cooking an apple pie for Thanksgiving while I was studying abroad.  It was the first time I made a pie from scratch, and it was a quick success.  Only recommendation is to sprinkle the crust lightly with a a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar.

Good, dependable basic pie crust recipe.  Easy to roll out.  Just what I wanted for my pumpkin pie.  Would make again.

On the advice of another review, I used half shortening, half butter. I followed the doubling instructions and substituted 1 cup of wheat flour for one of the cups of all purpose flour. This was an amazing substitution. 

I love this recipe. If I am doing a sweet pie, I use half the salt and 1/2 a tablespoon of sugar. If I am doing a chicken pot pie, I use the full amont of salt, and no sugar.

Perfect as is, but try using orange juice (without pulp) instead of water.  It not only gives it a little flavor, it also gives it a little color.  Initially I only used the orange juice when baking a rhubarb pie, but it was so good that I now use it for all pies, even quiche.

The crust is super simple to make.  It was nice and flaky.  I did not refrigerate my shortening before use (I started cooking as soon as I got home from the grocery store), but I did use ice water (no need to wait for water to chill in your fridge or freezer, just put it over ice as swirl it around a bit).  I wasn't sure if this recipe was for a top and bottom or just one - I was able to stretch it to make a top and bottom, but I'd probably increase the recipe by half next time to make that easier.   I chose to use 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening for flavor, but I think the texture would have been great either way.  I added some herbs/spices because I was making a savory pie, and I would maybe recommend using sugar if you're making a dessert pie.  This is definitely both the simplest and best tasting pie crust I've ever made.

My mother made the BEST pie crust I ever had.  She passed the recipe down to me which she got from her mother.  It's the same one.  Only we have always doubled it.  So our recipe is 3:1.  In fact, I use my food processor when I make it.  Pulse in the shortening (or lard as I use) and add ice cold water until it forms a ball.  Easy Peasy!

This is a good simple pie crust. Works well with single crust pies, but wouldn't suggest it for double crusted pies.

Very good, but I know a secret about pie crust.  Too bad I can not find "Wondra" in the five lb. bags at the grocery store any more!.........With that flour there was no way you could not have a wonderful flakey crust and it would get 10 stars!

This was too greasy and almost TOO tender for me - the crust was falling apart in the finished product!  I will use 1/3 cup shortening next time and up the water by a couple of Tbsp.

This pie crust was soooooo easy to make. It didn't take a lot of ingredients or time. The only complaint that I have is that it doesn't have much flavor. It is not suitable for dessert. It worked wonderfully on a chicken pot pie and quiche that I cooked though.  If you replaced the shortening with butter and added a little vanilla it would make a wonderful dessert crust. I will definatly use again.

This is a GREAT pie crust and very quick and easy to make.  Before this Thanksgiving, I had never made a pie and was nervous about living up to my family's expectations - grandma and my aunt always made great pies!  Thanks to this recipe (and 5 amazing pies later), I am officially the family pie maker.  I found I didn't need near as much water...be sure to add just a tablespoon at a time until you get the consistency you need.  I also found it was easier to work with the dough if I let it chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.  My mom also noted that this crust cooked perfectly  even on the bottom of the pies -- not sure if was the oven, the pans (we had 3 different varieties and all produced the same results) or something else I but, it worked!  No need to buy a box or frozen crust ever again.  Shortening has never been a staple in my pantry before but it will be now.  Thanks for making me look like a real baker Jan!

This is the PERFECT crust! I followed the advice of others and put my shortening in the freezer, cut it into my flour, and added ICE water just a little at a time until it just held together. It rolled out easily and made enough for dough for a *thick* crust, and it was soooooooooooo flaky! I made a double batch for a turkey pot pie, and my husband and I both drooled over the crust. I imagine you could sub the salt for sugar and use it for a sweet pie. This was so quick and easy, I won't be buying thin, gooey, nasty frozen crust again!

Please do not use vegetable shortening as it is hydrogenated.  You would actually be better using LARD as it at least has a better flavor.

I'm never going to use another pie crust again. This is amazing! No matter what I make, people always ask me for my crust recipe. Wow. I make it in my KitchenAid, allowing it to combine the flour and butter, and then I add the water afterwards. Make sure everything is COLD COLD COLD. I keep my flour in the freezer, so that's always cold. I chill my butter again after cutting it. I also put the bowl in the freezer for a few minutes before I use it. Make sure that your water is ice cold, by putting a few ice cubes in it while you're using it. After it's all combined, I wrap mine in saran wrap and refrigerate it before rolling it out.

I, too, absolutely use ice water!  Too save some work, place the flour, salt, butter/lard/shortening in food processor and pulse till crumbly.  Add ice water a little at a time, pulsing, till it comes together into a ball.  Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30  minutes.  Proceed with rolling and refrigerate before filling.  Don't overhandle or it will be tough.

Oh my, this is a great pie crust recipe, very flaky and full of flavor With minor adjustments of course. One being I added 2 Tab of sugar As suggested by another reviewer. I WAS CAREFUL in adding the water To be honest I used about 2 table spoons less of the water. I made an apple pie and let me just tell you me and my family of five just wanted to eat the crust!!!!!
Remember to treat doug gently

Great pie crust.  This recipe is a straight forward pie crust recipe and has amazing results.  The crust cooks perfectly for any application and stays very crispy on the top and bottom.  I highly recommend using this recipe for pies of any kind.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening, and a few teaspoons of sugar and let me tell you, this is MUCH better than the last recipe I used.  I followed other suggestions to add ice water a tablespoon at a time and it came together really nice, and rolled well after refrigeration.  It makes *just* enough dough for one double crust pie.  To make it work with two single crust pies I had to roll it really thin.  I will definitely make this again, just maybe quadruple it.  ;)

The only pie crust I can get to turn out great every single time. Only addition was an egg wash prior to baking. Don't pass this one up!

This was the first time I'd ever made a pie crust, and all I've ever heard from people his how difficult it can be. I thought this was simple, yet delicious! My only complaint is that there was no directions for how long to cook it.

I used it to make chicken pot pie, so I left it in for the usual 40 minutes, and the crust was done to perfection. This will be my crust recipe for good!

Thank you for this recipe! The dough was so manageable and I had no problems with cracking or sticking to the table. I had it for a pumpkin pie. However, I think next time I will add some sugar into the mix, especially if I'm making a berry pie. I did love it though for its simplicity and this time I truly had all the ingredients at home!

This is very easy and quick yet turns out flaky and tender.  As I was not using for a savory pie, but for a sweet one, I added a tablespoon of powdered sugar.  Like so many others, I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening in place of using all shortening. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!!  This pie crust is just as good as my sweet dear Grandma's were!  Flaky, easy to work with.  Add ice water by the tablespoon to see how much you need vs adding 1/2 cup all at once.  I used butter instead of vegetable shortening and it was phenomonal!

EXCELLENT!  I used this recipe to make individual chicken pot pies to freeze.  It was easy to do and no changes were necessary.  The dough was so nice to work with.  I used a silicone sheet to make the crust easy to pick up.  The recipe makes 3 individual pies with top and bottom crusts.  I double it and it works nicely.   I will be using this recipe often.  Thank you Jan Bittner for sharing.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving on two different pies - apple and pumpkin.  Then again at Christmas with cherry and pecan.  My family loved them all and raved about the crust.  This is my new go to recipe for pies.  Thanks for sharing!

I was nervous about making my own crust, but this turned out well.  Used half shortening, half butter and pre-baked the bottom crust with a little egg white brushed on. Thanks for the suggestion about using a pastry cloth. I ran out and bought a pastry cloth and a roller-pin cover and I had none of the usual problems with dough sticking to the pin, etc.

This pie crust is very easy to work with and delicious.  The only change I made was to not use my pastry cloth and extra flour.  I used two pieces of parchment and sprayed them with cooking spray.  Rolling the crust between the two pieces of parchment was easy and was even easier transferring the crust to the pie plate.

This crust is for savoury recipes only, not for sweet ones.  I tried to use this as a base for lemon pie and it was a disaster.

This is the best crust I have ever had, and super easy. I tried to make it harder then it was and over mixed it the first time, which made it harder to work with and denser (still tasted good) The second time when i added the water i was more gentle and as soon as it started to stick together it was ready. so DONT OVER MIX. it was so smooth, thick, fluffy, and stretchy, so easy to work with. Looking forward to using it all the time!

PERFECT pie crust. I used it for two pies on Thanksgiving (pecan and apple) and used it again the next day for a Turkey Pot Pie and it's delicious for both savory and sweet. Followed recipe exactly, no need to make any changes. Thank you Jan!!

When my grandmother complimented me on this pie crust (made with Apple Pie by Grandma Ople recipe) during Thanksgiving I knew that following this recipe exactly was key. Her pies in back in the days were too die for. I will use this recipe over and over again. Thank you! *I recommend watching the video tutorial for newbies - helped me a lot.

Perfecting a pie crust has been my downfall for almost 45 years; they end up too tender or too tough, so have resorted to buying a Pillsbury pie crust.  While it's a nice crust, I've always wished I could make a decent crust on my one.  

Today, I was going to make a chess pie for Sunday supper when I realized I was out of my store bought pie crust and thought I would once more attempt to make a crust.  After reading about your Grandmother's cottage industry during the depression, I had to try this recipe.  I can only say the trimmings that I sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar were so good, I can't wait for the reviews on the crust used in the pie.

Thank you SO much for sharing this family heirloom; it now the recipe I will be using!

The proportions of ingredients in making this pie crust recipe are indeed PERFECT....I thought i had a great recipe until I tried this one...it is THE BEST EVER...one I intend to use over and over again...thank you so much for posting...I chilled my dough long enough to make my filling which took about 10 to 15 minutes....then I rolled out the pie dough on parchment paper for easy cleanup....roll out was a breeze....taste was terrific...like I said, BEST PIE DOUGH RECIPE EVER....thanks again, so much, for sharing.

This is a perfect, simple recipe for a pie crust. I'd never made one from scratch before and thank goodness I found this recipe. Had to make one for Christmas dessert because the pie crust I'd bought puffed up during cooking and was unusable. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that I didn't roll the crust quite thin enough, which was my own fault. Other than being a bit thick, it came out perfect. I don't know that I'll ever buy another pie crust again!

I found this recipe a little difficult to make but after making 5 pies for Thanksgiving with this crust I mastered it the third try. You definitely want to add the water by teaspoons as opposed to all at once. I also found it easier to work with the dough when I refrigerated it for 30 minutes or until it was chilled because when I didn't I found the dough to be very very sticky even with floured hands and surfaces. Overall with these few changes to the recipe the dough came out with a crunchy crust and thick dough bottom which was perfect and everyone loved it! I'm rating it 4 stars because it was difficult to work with but it tasted perfect!

I wanted to make a pie crust forever but was too nervous, I actually thought it had to be difficult -- this recipe could not be any easier and I have to say it came out absolutely amazing!! Extremely flaky and so delicious, I was proud of myself! I used Kerry Gold butter instead of shortening, it came out so good. I made a chicken pot pie using this crust but for sure will try it out on desserts... this one is a keeper!

I normally avoid making pie crust, because I hate how complicated it can become with certain recipes.  Some require that you use freezing water (with an actual layer of ice), that you place the crust in the refrigerator for some time, etc.  Plus when it comes to made-from-scratch vs. store-bought, I feel like the crust is the least important part of the pie.  Most people just want the filling.

That said, I ran out of pre-made crusts this Thanksgiving, and had to make a from-scratch crust.  This was the EASIEST recipe I've ever used, plus it was tasty and had a nice texture.  

This is now my default crust recipe!

I usually don't have much luck with pie crusts, but I needed two for Thanksgiving, so I gave this recipe my best shot. I made a double recipe, and before starting I had the shortening in the freezer all day. Without a pastry cutter or food processor, I cut up the shortening in the flour using a pizza cutter. I put ice water in by the tablespoon, adding about 2/3 cup in total, and tossing the mixture with a fork after each addition. I put the dough in the freezer for about 30 minutes before I rolled it out.

I made this in the food processor.  It didn't need much water at all, so I think I ended up adding too much.  I put it in the fridge to firm up a bit before using.  I used it on a chicken pot pie, so those flavors made it difficult to taste the actual crust, but I think it was fine.  I will try it again with a fruit pie.

Close to perfect, and with adjustments I think this will be my go to pie crust.  Ran out of shortening and used 1:4 ratio of shortening to unsalted butter.  Easy to work with, but would reduce water for flakier crust.  Used food processor and might have overmixed before adding water; still had pea-sized lumps of fat, but I always find with food processor pie-crust, it's better to leave larger chunks of fat before adding the water, as the blades reduce the fat lumps during mixing.  I think a 1:1 ratio of shortening to butter would result in best balance of flake and flavor.  Really delicious and pretty flaky regardless.

OMG - I finally found the perfect pie crust recipe!  So simple, so easy to work with.  I did chill the dough after mixing.  I also used a pastry blender.  Fantastically flaky, and nit sticky at all.

Very good and easy to make. I substituted margarine for the shortening and used another user's tip of rolling it between 2 pieces of saran wrap. So much easier to lift it into the pie plate! This one is a keeper!

This didn't turn out well for me.  It might be me.  I weighed the flour rather than measured.  The dough was too much fat to flour ratio.  I tried to fix it by adding more flour but without success.  It fell apart when rolling and transferring to pie pan.  I patched it together but I expect it will break apart when served.  As it is just for us and not guests, I'm not worried about it.  I'm sure it will still taste well.

I used this recipe for an apple pie and it was so flaky and delicious. I feel however, that it's rightful place is with a savoury pie because it's exactly like those delicious flaky pastry on a meat pie at a great bakery. I just did it all in a food processor, let it rest in the fridge wrapped in plastic because I had stuff to do. So, yeah. It was great in a fruit pie, no complaints, but it would blow your mind in a meat pie. In a sweet pie, I would add a little sugar next time, but it was truly fabulous.

I really liked the way this pie curst turned out.  Light, crispy and tasty.  For me, it only made one curst so I had to do it twice to make the top.  I don't usually rate a recipe if I change it, but I decided to this time.  I uses half shortening and half butter.  I used a food processor and it was a very light cur.  I brushed it with milk and sprinkled a little sugar on top for color and I have to admit this was one of my best crust and I have made a "no-fail" crust for years.

This is an amazing crust!!! I used it for 
Grandma Ople's Apple Pie from this site. I used butter instead of shortening, and only needed about 3 T. water. Thank you for this recipe, it is my go-to crust recipe from now on. :)

Warning - when doubling this recipe, fully double all amounts as originally listed and do not used the reduced amount of flour as indicated.  Using the reduced amount of flour results in a tough, dense crust - not nice and flaky - it ruined my Christmas pie!

This was a very easy recipe to make. I put the shortening in the freezer for around 10 minutes as others suggested. I was about 2 tablespoon short of shortening and I added some butter to reach the cup since I was making a double crust. I made the dough a little wet but added some flour while rolling. The taste was really good. Used it to make Pineapple Mango Pie from this site.

I tried using the recipe that was provided for a double crust. By the time I got the shortening required mixed in (1 c), there was no use for the water at all. I'll try this again, but will use 3/4 c shortening instead.

I've made a lot of pies before, but this crust takes the cake!  Flaky and rich like a pastry, but still substantial enough to hold the filling, I can honestly say this is the best crust I've ever made!

Note: I tried making one batch with some finely chopped pecans and a dash of cinnamon incorporated into the crust...worked out great and added a nice nutty flavor to my apple pie!

Wow!  This was my first time making a homemade crust, and my husband said I need to always make homemade.  This was way better than any storebought crust!  So flaky and the perfect texture!  Very easy to handle!  I added a little sugar to the crust since I made it with a berry pie.  Will make over and over again!

Easy to make and use.  I also used butter due to lack of shortening. My mom said the crust was perfect and she is in the food biz.  I used it for pumpkin and chocolate chip pie.

Although this looked nice in the pan, it was very chewy and tough.  Not my favorite recipe.

nice and flaky. very easy to handle and make. remember to add water gradually, because i didnt end up using as much waster as the recipe called for.

This is the easiest pie crust dough I have ever made. It is almost effortless as it turns out perfectly every single time. Very easy to handle as well. Thanks,Jan.

I've tried lots of pie crust recipes. This one is the best! The last crust I made was too crumbly, so I wanted to try a different blend. I measured the flour and shortening by weight, using the equivalents on this site. Perfect. So easy to handle, and transfered from rolling mat to pie plate without a single rip or tear. This one goes to the top of the list!

using a food processor makes this super fast and easy.  I ended up using a little less than 1/2 cup water and it rolled out really well!

I don't know of anything else that tests my patience quite like making pie crust. I decided to try a new recipe, & this was it. I doubled the recipe to make a 2 crust pie & didn't quite double the water. Wow! So easy & it turned out so well! Plus, I had enough leftover dough to make another pie. No more shedding tears over pie crusts, I'm sticking to this! Thank you!

Quick, easy, flaky and delicious.  Will definitely use again!  Ended up using only about 1/4 cup of water and the consistency turned out great.

I am very happy with this crust. I made my brother a pie using this crust recipe, fresh rhubarb recipe from this site & a crumble topping from Martha Stewart. He states "BEST PIE EVER"... which makes it all worth it! I used 1/4 cp butter flavored crisco & 1/4 unsalted butter. The crust was very easy to work with. I didn't taste it myself and that's the only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars.

I hate making pie crust cause they never turn out. After watching on how to make a pie crust video on this site, I sucked it up and went for it. I decided to make a recipe & a 1/2 so I can have some for the top. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening. Mixed the cold cut butter with the flour & salt. Slowly added the ice water with a teaspoon till the dough stuck together by hand. Used about 5-6 teaspoons of water. Divided the dough and wrapped them in plastic and refridgerated them for about 1 hour. Took them out and rolled the bottom pie crust on a silpath so I didn't need to add extra flour. Placed the crust in the pie pan and molded it. Rolled the second dough and used cookie cutters for the top decorations. Refridgerated both crust for 30 minutes then added my fresh blackberry filling. After it was done and cooled, my husband, who loves pie crust more than the pie, gave me a big thumbs up. This will be my staple crust, when I have time to make it. Thanks!

I placed the shortening in the freezer for several hours before making the pie crust, and I chilled the water in the fridge.  I followed the directions exactly and the pie crust was perfect.  It is the best pie crust I've ever eaten.

Best pie crust ever! I used earth balance butter instead of shortening and made the crust in my food processor. It was so easy that I dont even know why I had been so scared of making pie crusts. However, I do think the key is to make sure all the ingredients are as cold as possible! I have used this recipe a couple of times already and the crust comes out perfect and flakey every time! This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this for my first time at pie crust.  It worked!  I mixed half shortening and half butter, creaming it together then freezing it.  Then when I am ready I grate the frozen shortening/butter into the flour mixture, to make sure my dough is not over-worked.

Like some of the users of ths recipe, I was afraid of making homemade pie crust, BUT not anymore! this recipe is easy, flakey, delicious ,friendly and quick to make.  I just made a apple pie with the lattice top and it is delicious! I used butter instead of shortening. My husband said that he loves it.  

Since I am a baker and caterer this will work just fine for me.  Store bought is fine when in a pinch, but when there is a recipe like this, why would you use store brought? Now, I just need to order some 9" pie pans and I will be in business. 

Thanks to the person who posted this recipe.  Your grandmother did you proud by giving you this recipe and I pray that you will be blessed for your generosity. :-)

I'm not into baking much so I generally use store bought pastry crust. Tonight I baked a Turkey pot pie 1 ( allrecipes recipe! ) and needed extra pie crust and found this one. It turned out wonderful! Just as tasty and flaky as the store bought! And much cheaper! I will be using this one when needed and save a few bucks! Thank you so much! God Bless!

Excellent and easy pie crust.  I also tried it with a cube of butter instead of shortening and it was perfect.  This recipe is also plentiful, more than enough for a one crust pie allowing lots of extra overhang to make a very pretty crust edge :)

Wow, this is the first time that I've actually had success at making pie crust and not being totally frustrated.  I'm not sure the ingredients are all that different, but the mixing instructions were very helpful.  Also was the review that said she used 6 Tablespoons.  I suspect I've under added water in the past.

Great, easy pie crust recipe. To easily incorporate butter (which I used instead of shortening), I grate it with my cheese grater, and then use my (not-so-great) pastry knife to mix.

So easy and simple, and tastes great.  How can you go wrong?  The only mistake I made was not to grease the quiche pan--it didn't want to come away from the pan when cutting it.  But that's easily resolved.  I always end up with too much pie crust, but I did something else with the remainder.  I'll use this recipe again.  thanks for the recipe!

I made this with butter instead of shortening and 1 tbsp. sugar. Delicious!

5 stars for being easy to work with, perfect measurements and making exactly 1 9" deep pie crust. I used butter flavored Crisco, did not use ice water or cool the dough, came out just fine, not fragile and not too sticky, I'm a NOVICE pastry maker and this recipe worked well for me. Didn't have a rolling pin so improvised with a floured up water glass :) It was kind of bland and not particularly flaky but I can always add sugar and/or spice to the dough next go around.  Thanks!!

Very easy to make.  Crisp and a little bit flaky.  Not quite as flavorful as I was hoping, but very good.  Certainly would use this recipe again.

Really good flaky & tender pie crust.  I refrigerated the dough for 30 min before rolling it out, then again before baking it.  I had no shrinkage at all.

This is the Crisco pie crust recipe.  It was on the inside label many years ago and I have used it for 40 years.  It just never fails.  If you are using butter it's good but it's not the recipe that is written.  Please review the original first and then comment.

The crust turned out good. The only thing I may add next time is maybe a little sugar. It lacked a bit of sweetness.

This is an easy and excellent pie crust.  Add the water as needed. Do not just dump the entire 1/2 cup in unless you need to.

This crust was the best!!! I am so excited it turned out so well for my double crust potpie. I used a fork this time instead of a pastry blender and it worked a lot better for me. It was SO flaky and perfect - the best I've ever made! YUM! I used ice water and added in a few tablespoons at a time.

Fantastic! I found myself short two-pie crusts on Thanksgiving afternoon when the two refrigerated crusts from the store turned out to be far too small for my apple pie.  - ONE TIP -  Don't be surprised when even a single recipe rolls out FAR bigger and thicker than you expect. Mine went into the pie pan far thicker than most pie crust recipes, but I got rave reviews and had many requests for the recipe. This turns out wonderfully moist and flaky. Perfect for a moist pie like apple or cherry where the extra crust helps hold in the filling.

I felt like a baking pro when I easily rolled this pie crust. I used my food processor to combine all the ingredients. I doubled the recipe with no adverse results. The crust looks good enough to eat!

I used this not for a pie but for making a version of my grandma's "Pasties" (meat pocket) recipe.  I couldn't find her original recipe but I think she'd be so pleased with how my crusts came out from this recipe.  Very easy - this one's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing, Jan ;)

So easy to make and use.  I haven't tried it as a double recipe but using it as a crust for a custard pie it is good.  Last time I used it, it did poof, so I suggest pricking it with a fork if you are doing a pre-baked crust.

i wouldnt say this is a bad recipe because it is very quick and easy but i really think taking the extra time to refrigerate the shortening and the dough after it is made makes a flakier crust and it is easier to roll out.

I made my very first homemade pie crust this Turkey Day thanks to this fantastic and fantastically easy recipe.  I combined this with my first homemade Sweet Potato Pie using this recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sweet-Potato-Pie-I/Detail.aspx  It's all absolutely scrumptious (with a great flaky crust)!!!

This had good flavor and flakiness, but for some reason my crust was really soft in some places, and hard as rock in others. I want to try this again, though, because I think it has potential.

This has become my new basic crust - I do like more of a butter taste, so I use 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening.  This dough is SO easy to work with, I love it.  I did double the recipe to make a two crust pie, I had to add some extra flour.  The key is to keep everything cold and add the water just a tablespoon at a time, as I only used about 3/4 of the water.  While rolling out the first half for the bottom, keep the other 1/2 in the fridge.  Use ice water and put shortening and butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes before using.  For an applie pie, I added 1 teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of cinnamon.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe worked like a charm! The first time I have ever been happy with a homemade rolled pie crust, but to be fair it's my first crust with my Kitchenaid rolling pin (which is nonstick coated). I was able to mix, roll, and transfer this pie crust to the plate without EVER putting down the phone I had cradled against my ear. It doesn't get any easier to use than that! P.S. It doesn't need any sugar unless you grew up eating sweet pie crusts. Pie crusts for sweet pies are traditionally not sweet, and this one is no exception.

Pie crust has always intimidated me.  I've always heard how hard it was to make it right - and if you didn't make it right it was just awful.  Well no more fear for me, this pie crust is easy to make, easy to work with, and is absolutely wonderful!  Thanks so much, I'll never buy refrigerated pie crusts again.

I used this recipe for the second pie I've ever made and it worked out so well! The trick to a good pastry is to make sure all of your ingredients are VERY cold. I even put my flour in a stainless steel bowl and placed it in the fridge for a short while. Plus I placed my water in the freezer to make it nice and cold. The only thing I substituted was unsalted butter in place of shortening.

Delicious! I use this recipe for making pasties. I roll the dough out between two pieces of wax paper and add a dusting of flour to keep it from sticking!

What a great simple recipe.  I actually keep repeating the ingredients in my head for some reason.  I made this for an apple pie my husband had been requesting for months.  No one should be afraid of pie crust with this recipe.  The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 shorting.

I've only made this once.  I had to use margarine instead of shortening, but it was still very good. Next time I will add a bit of vinegar to keep the crust flaky.

This crust worked well for me, both with fruit pies and with pasties (meat/veggie) pies.

I used the shortening for the pasties I made and butter for the fruit pies I made and either way it worked well.

The only thing really to keep in mind is that you need to add the ice water just a little at a time so that you can form the dough ball and it not be sticky.

I'm a good cook - but I lose almost every battle with pie crust until now! After throwing away a batch of pie crust from a previous recipe (what a mess) I tried this one and hoped.  Sure enough it was manageable and didn't fall apart when I tried to make lattice pieces. Beautiful. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used "cold" water, 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.

Okay, I finally made a good one!  I took the advice and "treated the pie crust lightly", which basically means I just stirred the ingredients together just until it stuck, rolled it out, and didn't fool with it.  And what do ya know, it turned out great.

Finally I am confident with my pie crust. This is such a good recipe. I now reign as the pie crust queen in my family :) I use butter flavored crisco and follow the recipe exactly, not handling any more than necessary. It comes out perfectly.

This was the first time I ever attempted to make a pie crust (in India from all places!). I read some of the comments and added just a little bit of sugar to it, and added the iced water one tablespoon at a time. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. The crust (and the whole pie) came out real well, nice and flaky. I never realized how much better a home-made crust is than a store-bought. I don't think I will ever buy a pie in the store again... In addition the nice thing was that I only used half of the recipe to make a single crust, saved the rest in the fridge. I ended up using it 2 days later (the pie I made was gone in no time and everybody wanted more!). The crust came out even better this time, if at all possible. Great recipe, a keeper for sure!

Only one word to describe this crust - PERFECT!!! I used butter flavored Crisco shortening.  I also rolled the pie dough out between two pieces of wax paper.  Then peeled back the top layer, placed it in my pie pan, pulled back the other layer of wax paper, pricked the bottom and sides with a fork, and poured in my pumpkin pie filling. This crust stood the test of baking for 1 hour and 20 minutes without burning the edges! It was very beautiful and flaky. It cut perfectly and just melted in my mouth. I will never use store-bought pie crust ever again. Thanks!

I gave up attempting to make crust after many failed attempts.  However, I needed one yesterday and could not make it to the store to buy one.  So I looked on my favorite web site and am so happy I did!  I followed the recipe exactly and this pie crust is wonderful, very flaky, easy to use, by far and even looked beautiful!  I did brush it with beaten egg prior to baking for a glossy look.  Just beautiful!  Thank you!

This truely is Great Pie Crust.  I made apple pie and beforeadding the water, I added just under a teaspoon of sugar and a couple sprinkles of cinnamon, and a smaller amount of nutmeg and cloves- It was a nice touch.  Next time I think I might added a wee bit more sugar- pie crust turned out wonderfully.  It was easy to work with and very simple to roll out.  I found that I did not even need all of the water to get the right consistency.  Will use again.

Rolling out pie crust has never been this easy. I was inspired and make apple dumplings that were to die for. I also make apple pies, adding cinnamon,sugar and finely chopped nuts to the dough. These are new family favorites. I JUST LOVE THIS SITE.

How easy is this?!? Soooooo easy and a breeze to handle as well! Perfect size for a large single crust pie. I used it this time for a key lime pie, so I pre baked it - placing my pie plate on a preheated cookie sheet at 400 for about 10 minutes ... beautiful!

After following the directions, we ended up with stretchy dough that ended up tasting really bad. We had to just eat the filling out of the crust.

Wonderful flakey crust that you can't mess up if you tried. I've made it as written, used Butter, used up to 1/4 c sugar when filling with bittersweet mousse, and have rolled it as well as pressed it into muffin tins to make mini fruit pies. When baking before adding filling, I bake at 400 degrees for 10+ minutes after pricking fork holes in the bottom. You can't go wrong with this!

I have tried four different pie crust recipes and I always have problems with pie crust tearing but I read the reviews and they were encouraging. I made this pie crust and it worked great. I did not have amy problems rolling it out and it tasted great. I did as suggested in the reviews and added water a little at a time. I ended using 7 tablespoons. It did only make enough for a bottom crust so next time I will double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing

This pie crust is excellent. I have made a few pie crusts and never seem to be able to get that crisp flakiness, I so badly desired. If it is slightly crispy it will seem to not have much flavor. I finally figured out the right balance for my tastes. I used the above recipe and made it exactly as stated, only doing half butter (I used salted butter) and half plain shortening or (4 level tablespoons). Unfortunately, I get pie crust down and heard that trans-fat, which I assume may include vegetable shortening, would be banned soon for use and sale. Until then, this is my planned recipe and method for pie crusts. I used the butter for flavor and some softness. I used the shortening for the crispiness. I used the idea after trying a cookie that I used 1/2 of both, instead of all shortening, and it worked great in those too. When I added the water, I still had close to 1/4 cup left when the dough came together. This rolled very nicely after refrigerating over-night. My plan was to make a quiche, more likely, so I just par-baked the crust at 400 deg to finish baking later. Upon, using it in anther recipe I found that the crust got too browned tasting with a little over cooking. So, next time I will look for recipes that require only 45-50 minutes at most total bake time, or just bake lightly for cold pies, while keeping the edges well covered if possible. I still would like to try to use this crust for Thanksgiving or Christmas pies. ty

Thank you for giving me this recipe! I always have a hard time baking. This crust was not very difficult. I tried to be gentle as you suggest and it looks great. There will be more pies made in my oven.

Perfect! I forgot to take pictures of my pretty lattice crusted pies (apple, peach, and raspberry). I have never been able to make a good pie crust no matter how hard I've tried and I do a lot of cooking. So I decided to try this simple recipe and follow it verbatim. I didn't want to experiment and make any changes before seeing how this recipe turned out. Not only was it the best crust I've ever made, but it was the best I've ever tasted. I saw a review saying that it was too greasy and tender and my crusts (top or bottom) didn't turn out that way at all. All crisp and flaky and so much better than frozen pie crusts. I was very careful to only add just enough water for the dough to hold together and I think that was the biggest key to success. P.S. This recipe is enough to make one bottom or top crust, so you'd have to double it for a double-crusted pie.

This is now my go -to pie crust recipe - flaky and perfect.  I use lard (or occasionally butter) and have used up to half whole wheat flour with no problem.

I substituted butter for the shortening and milk for the water. Turned out great. Nice and flaky. Definitely going to become my go-to crust recipe!

This crust is so easy and it comes out light and flaky… perfect!  I doubled the recipe to use it for the "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople" from this website, and it worked great with that recipe.

Only thing I changed was that I used butter instead of Shortening. I dont like putting this nasty thing called shortening in my stomach. Butter works perfectly

I had not made a pie in a while, partly because I had never been all that great at pie crusts. This....changed it all. It is easy, forgiving, and turned out great. I dislike crust usually, but I ate it on the apple pie I made with this. Now I am no longer afraid of pie crusts...I know I can make a flaky, delicious crust with ease thanks to this recipe.

I had never made pie crust before and probably never will again!!!  It is a lot of work... but I didn't have any premade crust and wanted to make chicken pot pie so I thought I would give it a try.  I think I'll run to the store and spend the money next time.  It was very good though!

A very basic, very easy yet DELICIOUS flaky pie crust! I did not change anything other than I set my water in the freezer for 10 minutes before I used it. I used the crust for Chicken pot pie and it held up well. I pre-baked the bottom crust for 8 minutes, and it was perfect. SO flaky. I am an experienced pie, cake, bread baker, and this is by far my favorite crust recipe.

I love this pie crust! All I did was throw everything into my food processor, whiz it up until it came together, and BAM! instant pie crust. I also used butter flavoured Becel instead of shortening, just my personal preference.

So easy and so good! I did substitute white whole wheat flour and as soon as I run out of shortening, I'll switch to butter. I'm sure it'll be just as good with that. One last thing, I hate working with dough so I do use my food processor to combine the ingredients. I think it works just fine. Both batches I made today turned out just fine.

Perfect pie crust.  Rolls out with no problem and extremely easy to work with.  Double the recipe for a nice thick crust for a large pie.  I used half butter and half shortening with less water than the recipe called for.

I was making apple turnovers, so I added some cinnamon and a teaspoon of sugar to the crust. Came out great.  Would try an egg wash next time for nice browning.

This was a good crust. Nothing spectacular but good. Next time I think that I might sub 1/4 cup of butter forthe same amount of shortening. I wish that it specified that it only made a single crust. All in all a decent crust tho.

This pie crust was so quick and easy to make. Dough was very easy to work with. Followed the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of sugar to the dough, probably about a teaspoon. Used this to make a fresh strawberry pie to use up some strawberries that were in my fridge. I baked it at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes or so. This recipe is a very good one. It produced a nice, flaky, simple crust that I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe, but I think I mixed it too much...it came out a little tough. Unfortunately the dog stole most of the pie off the table, so I'm the only one that got to taste it! We'll see what everyone thinks next time.

This is the best pie crust recipe I have ever used (and I've tried a lot!).  I love it because you can roll it out immediately after mixing the indgredients (no refrigerator time).  It didn't tear on me one time.  5 stars!!

This crust went great with the Chocolate Pecan Pie III recipe on this site. I substituted margarine for the shortening as I ran out of shortening and it came out delicious.

I used butter instead of shortening and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  As other reviewers said, add the water a little bit at a time.  Easy and inexpensive, no need to buy any from the store again!

As a novice cook and baker, pie crust naturally scared me. Tried this recipe and it's so easy to make and turns out great! I've used it in both sweet and savory recipes and has never let me down. I like it so much because if you're out of shortening you can substitute butter or margarine or vice versa.

I am so impressed with my skills ((: It was so easy to make. I used butter since I had no shortening. Very flaky. I will never look for a different recipe for pie crust

This pie crust was exceptionally easy to work with.  The only thing I would change is to just add a little bit more salt for my taste, but that's just me.

This crust is very good for pot pies and pumpkin pie alike. However, I would state that it needs to have butter instead of shortening the taste and texture is much more delightful.

FINALLY! I found the pie crust I will always use. Its perfect texture and ratio of flour to shortening. Its flaky and taste good. Since I was baking a fruit pie, I added 1 tbsp sugar to the crust. Everything else is perfect...no change at all. Really simple and easy. The secret here is just timing in baking according to your oven. DELICIOUSO!!!

this is an excellent recipe! i have always had trouble making pie crust before but this turned out beautifully. i used less flour (i had made double the recipe and instead of using 3 cups, i used 2.5).. it was more "buttery" and flaky, but i think a bit more flour might be better. it made more than 2 pie bottoms (would be perfect if making 2 pies with top and bottom). i also used non-hydrogenated margarine ("earth balance" brand which is all natural and excellent). the rest was the same. i added the water a little at a time as i mixed (less than the amount called for - just mix water in till it is a good consistency.. soft but not too wet). i also used 2 dinner knives to cut the flour and margarine together until very crumbly before i added the water. it came out very flaky and delicious! foolproof!

I LOVE this pie crust and the best thing is that it is so EASY to make. I always hear people saying that they don't make their own pie crust because of how hard it is to roll out. I do not have one single problem when it comes to using this pie crust recipe. This is my go to recipe for pie crust.

Simply perfect, 
a great crust, i was making a pumpkin pie and used this recipe. I slightly pre-baked the crust. When the pie was ready for eating, I found the crust to be a nice compliment. The right amount of flakiness & great balance in taste.
Don't handle your dough to much, and your crust will be flaky and just right.

Cheers!

I had never made a pie crust before and for some reason I was under the impression that it was something that was really difficult to do.  Thanks to this recipe I am now a pro at making pie crusts.  I adjust it to make 12 servings and use the extra to make a the lattice top for my apple pies.  Be careful to just add a tbsp of cold water at a time.  The first time I made it I ended up using the entire 1/2 cup of water so then the second time I just dumped the water in and it ended up being too much.

OMG!!!  Wonderful!!  The last time I tried to make a crust, it was just awful.  Folks had to scrape the pumpkin pie filling out as their forks would not go thru the crust.  Since then I have been buying storebought crusts.  Went apple picking and wanted to make a pie but didn't have store crust... saw this and figured I would try it.  SO easy.  It is very flaky and looks and tastes JUST like my Gram's crust.  I can't believe I made it.  So, this is foolproof and delicious.  Give it a try.

Nice flaky crust.  5 stars for texture and appearance.  It was also easy to work with and didn't stick to my rolling pin.  It didn't have much flavor by itself though (3 stars).  The second time I made this recipe it was for a pecan pie, so I added 1 Tbsp. sugar.  It was wonderful.  I also used the recipe a third time for a chicken pot pie.  I added a dash of garlic poweder and a couple of pinches of thyme.  It made a wonderful savory crust with flavor.  This is a great recipe that is very versitale, but I think it needs some extras to make it a 5 star recipe.

4.5 Stars: This was my first homemade pie crust.  It was quite simple to make, but needed more salt, especially if making a savory dish.  I will use the recipe again, but use 3/4 tsp salt.  I expect it may need closer to 1 tsp.

I use butter flavored Crisco sticks and add a little bit of sugar.  This crust turns out light and flaky, flavorful and perfect every time! As another poster said, fluff with a fork after every tbsp or 2 of water.  Great recipe.

Wow! Two sticks of Blue Bonnet and just a drop of water, and I used my hand to mix it and floured the counter top an used a tall glass jar to roll it!
One pie and some cookies later, I'm flabbergasted at how EASY this thing was to make, not to mention how good it tasted! I did add a spoon full of sugar as well. THANK YOU!

Perfect pie crust every time!  Follow ingredients and directions as stated and you won't be dissappointed!  The only thing I have changed up is to chill the dough before rolling out while I get my pie filling ready.

Tip:  I always add a tablespoon of sesame seed to the crust before I start cutting in the shortening.  It gives your crust a bit more flavor.

So, this was my very first attempt at homemade crust. Overall, it went very well. I used unsalted butter in place of the vegetable shortening. Make sure you chill the water in the freezer and add the flour little by little. I will most definitely use this recipe again.

Ok, I usually do NOT have luck with homemade pie crusts so this must be a really fool-proof recipe! I loved it! It was tender, flaky, easy, no-fuss, and it rolled out beautifully. The proportions were right on. I'm keeping this in my files and it will be my go to anytime I need to bake a pie!

A perfect crust for pumpkin pie.  Nice and tender even when I have rerolled it several times to make decorative tops.  Very easy to work with!  I have also made it using whole wheat flour several times now and it is great!

I never had much luck with pastry before but this one is very easy, follow these directions exactly and you will have a perfect pie crust! I used the excess to make delightful apple turnovers.

I've made this crust a gazillion times and it hasn't failed me yet.  Great taste, texture and presentation; can be mixed the real way or you can melt the butter and fake it, tastes just as good.  This is my standard pie crust for "Grandma Ople's Pie."  I do usually double the recipe and make thicker crusts.

THIS ONE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! It was very easy to make (I used a pastry cutter), very easy to handle for single and for double crust and is absolutely flaky and delicious! And that for the very first time  I made a crust myself! I`m so excited, I`ll never again buy one :)

Great, easy pie crust!!!  I didn't have enough shortening, so I did half shortening and half chilled butter.  I also doubled the recipe for a 2 crust pie.

This is the first homemade pie crust recipe I have ever tried and it was so easy and so good...it is also going to be the last. I added about one tablespoon of powdered sugar to sweeten it up a bit and cooled it in the fridge 30 minutes before baking. I used it for a pecan pie recipe and I will never go back to store bought crusts!

Absolutely the easiest and tastiest pie dough and crust I've ever made.  I am clearing out my recipe file and putting this one as my "GO TO" crust recipe.  I've made it four times (exactly as written) and it's been excellent every time.  Thanks for submitting the ONLY pie crust recipe I'll ever need again!

Great recipe. I also refrigerate the shortening, so it actually looks crumbly and its easier to handle. I also refrigerate for more than an hour, for some reason it makes the pie flakier and yummy. Thanks

Never Failed me! I usually roll the crust and put the pan inside the fridge for 10 minutes before I fill it. For sweeter crust just add some sugar.

This was the first crust I've ever attempted.  I found it to be decent but not especially worth noting.  It didn't taste like anything too special.  I also wasn't too pleased with the texture as well.  When I finished baking it as a strawberry pie, I felt that the bottom of the crust was too dense, and that the top part was too hard.  I do prefer a flakier and softer crust, so I will keep looking.  Thanks anyway!

Excellent recipe! I added a couple tablespoons of confectioners sugar for a tart fruit pie, but would use without any change for a savory one. Delicious, easy, and a definite keeper!

This is my go-to pie crust for EVERYTHING. I have made it now three times in the past week and it keeps getting easier. I've never really been a baker but this recipe makes me pass as someone with years of experience.  I do use 1/4 c shortening and 1/4 c butter to get a tasty, flaky crust but that is the only thing I change.  I did take other reviewer's recommendations and add the water 1 tbs. at a time. I end up not using all the water - just enough to hold it together. (When I make a double crust I double all the ingredients but still put the water in 1 tbs at a time. I end up using about 1/4c LESS than what a double recipe would call for.) I put it in the fridge for an hour before rolling it out. After I put it in the pan I put it back in the fridge while I'm making my filling. Like I said before, my crust comes out better each time I make it.  I 100% recommend to everyone!

This is now my "GO-TO" pie crust recipe!   I started using it between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I have used it to make dessert pies, quiche, and chicken pot pie!  Before now I just bought the frozen pie crusts, but no more.  Easy and inexpensive.  Try it!  If you don't like it you're only out a few cents and a few minutes of your time.  But wait until you hear your friends and family say----"is this home made pie crust too???  Ohhhh wow... it's delicious!"  Then you'll know what a winner it is.

I made this crust with "Grandna Opal's Apple Pie" from this site, and it turned out great! I got many compliments on the crust so I think this will be the crust that I use from here on out. I do want to try it as the crust for a pot pie and see how that works. Thanks for such a good recipe!

I've never made a pie crust from scratch before and I was a little nervous because the dough was quite sticky because of all the shortening called for in this recipe but the end product, man! was fantastic. Flaky, flavorful I'll and virtually effortless. I'll never use a pre-made crust again.

Make sure to keep your shortening cold for a flakier crust. It tastes rather good and is useful for savory or sweet pies. I doubled the recipe and had no problems. I didn't add much of the water (less than half) before it reached the ideal consistency.

Super easy and creates a nice flaky crust!  I've always followed my mom's advice for making a flaky crust.  The less you handle the dough, the better.  Handling it too much will make it tough.  Another secret is using ice water.  I usually fill a large measuring cup with ice and then fill it with water... let it sit for at least 15 min before adding it to the flour mixture.

I made apple pie to bring to a thanksgiving meal with my boyfriend's family, and the compliments I received centered around the crust.  I realized too late that I lacked a roller and pastry cloth, so I had to resort to using a PAM spray bottle to roll out the dough on sheets of paper towel.  Even though I floured immensely, small bits of paper towel got stuck on the dough.  I would stick closely with the recipe and roll it out on a pastry cloth.    Despite doubling the servings for a top and bottom, there was barely enough dough to cover the bottom of a 9-inch pie and to make the lattice top, but this could be related to the roller issue.  I used a stoneware pie dish, which prevented issues with uneven cooking; I would recommend this type of dishware to enhance the recipe.  The actual prep time is about 30 to 45 minutes.

OMG!Victory! Ive tried to make so many pie crusts, that ended up in a trash, and this is the first one that I actually was be able to roll out! without any floured surfaces or wraps or whatever else, it was easy, I doubled the recipe and it was enough for a top and bottom of 9 inch pie. Thank you!

This was, by far, the best pie crust I've tried. Even with my dutch apple pie overflowing, the crust didn't buckle, become soggy, or get chewy. I used a vegan shortening and it worked wonderfully. This will absolutely be my new standard crust.

Worked great for my homemade pumpkin pie! Put it in fridge for about 15 minutes after I had made it into a ball and before I rolled it. I rolled it between two pieces of plastic rap. Will use again.

Excellent, but was not sure what size pie plate to use. I used a nine inch and that looks right.   I was not too sure about the amount of water, being a true pie novice, but I made it once and it was great.  Second time I think I could have used more water, but have not baked it yet. I will definitely keep working on this one!

Fantastic!  Have always used butter but no more for me.  This crust is beautiful, flaky and easy to handle.  I definately did not use 1/2C. of water however so you need to only use what is needed.

The proportions on this recipe are PERFECT! I used whole wheat flour for health reasons and the texture of the crust was still perfect. We put it under a quiche. If you do use whole wheat flour, I would recommend adding a bit of sugar, even for savory pies. Otherwise the wheat flavor can be a bit overpowering.

Yummy! I followed the recipe, but due to heat and humidity, only needed half of the ice water. It was very flaky with a simple, homemade taste, and mixed well in my stand-up mixer with the dough hook.

I love making pie, but I've never been so happy with my crust recipes.  This one was FABULOUS.  I think I told my husband about three times how lovely the dough was while I was rolling it out.  He finally said, "Yeah, I've been hearing a lot about that pie crust!"  haha, it was really that good!  I followed the recipe exactly.

I was never able to consistently make a good pie crust until now. Great recipe. I seem to always use 1/4 cup ice water, if that helps. The only time this recipe didn't work was when I dumped in the entire 1/2 cup.

Incredibly easy recipe, tastes delicious. The only thing I would do is add slightly less water as an entire cup makes it a little runny. Also, chill in the fridge for about a half hour before rolling it out and it's much easier to work with.

I can't believe I'm giving a pie crust a 5 star review. I despise pie crust, but I guess not anymore. This is PERFECT as is with out changing a thing. Those who said it was sticky used to much water. The directions say to add as much as needed to hold together which was just over 1/8 of a cup for me. This will be the last pie crust recipe I ever make.

Alright, I have a few things to say about this recipe. First of all - some of the reviews here can be misleading. The ingredients are very easy and simple to put together, however, a child cannot make this without assistance. A BEGINNER level cook cannot even make this without assistance because the dough was hard to roll out for me. The dough is also very sticky so I had to refrigerate it for 30 mins and add extra flour when I was rolling it out. But other than that, it's a delicious outcome. I suggest brushing the top up with some butter before you bake and not taking this on alone if you don't have experience with pie crust.

Great crust!  I made my granny's buttermilk pie with this crust, and it was perfect.  Followed recipe exactly, no chilling, no embellishments.  Beautiful, easy crust.

I have not had a lot of luck with homemade pie crusts, but this one never fails for me!  Sometimes I make w/ 1/4c. shortening and 1/4c. butter.  Also if am making a potpie or something savory I may add a little poultry magic powder or seasoned salt to taste.  For sweets I subst. a little cold fruit juice for water.  Love it!

I'm very pleased at how easy this was and how nice the dough texture was, even before refridgeration.  It doesn't need much water, as other reviews said.  6 TBSP was enough for the original recipe.  Makes a great crust for quiche or pot pies.  Original recipe yields one and doubling it gets just two.  Don't expect 3.

For a first time crust maker this recipe surprised me greatly in how easily it went together. I followed some hints from other reviewers (adding the ice cold water a tbs at a time BTW I ended up not needing the whole 1/2 cup water so good tip also letting the dough chill for 30 min. before rolling out made it very easy to roll out) along with reading the pie crust making article on this site (tip-let the dough rest in the fridge for 20 min. or so and it will not shrink up while baking) and it was so simple I couldn't believe it turned out so good!

This was my first pie crust and found it challenging to roll out the dough.  I gave up on the rolling pin and eventually just used my hands.  The flavor and texture on the end result was amazing!

Another glowing review for this crust. I too, have attempted pie crust many times, but never got it right. This one came out just right! Light and flakey. I chilled the shortening before making, and that supposedly helps too.

Easy pie crust to make. I made this with a blueberry pie. The crust turned out nice and flaky. The flavor of the crust was just great. I will be using this crust from now on. I am going to trim off more of the edging it was a little thick for my liking. It was wonderful.Thank you for sharing!

It was good and really easy.  It wasn't as flaky as I expected, and the water it calls for is too much; the dough was a bit sticky. I will probably try another recipe, just cause there are lots out there, but this is a good one.

After looking at several pie crusts on this site, I decided to try this one because of all the positive ratings.  I was a little skeptical at first because most of the other recipes had a lot more ingredients and this one was so simple.  I am so glad I chose this recipe.  The dough was so easy to work with.  It rolled out beautfully and it had a great taste and texture once baked.  I used it with Grandma Oples Apple Pie.

I can't believe it!  I am not a baker at all and I actually dread baking, bc I've had a fair bit of mishaps, when it came to baking. However, I wanted to make my own pies, bc they are hard to come by in Japan...and voila, for the first time, I ever made meat pies, the crust was amazing!  It was easy and it came out extremely flaky, while soft and buttery in the inside of the pie. Due to this recipe, I don't dread the idea of making pies or any sort of pastries anymore!

This is great. Very yummy. I used it for a two crust pie. Just be careful about putting the 2-crusts in the pie plate b/c they're thin and can tear easily.

Loved it!! I've been looking for a quick and simple pie crust recipe for ages, until yesterday when I found this marvel. It's versatile, and probably the easiest crust I've ever made. Used margarine instead of shortening, added 1/2 teaspoon sugar and less than 1/2 cup water. Thanx for sharing!

excellent recipe - tender flaky crust.  The only change I made after the first crust was to increase the salt by 1/8 tsp.  It gives the crust way more flavor - otherwise it's just kind of tasteless.

The proportions in this pie crust are right on, but I find it 10x better with butter in place of shortening. The usual tips apply: use cold, cubed butter and cut in until pea-sized. I add a few cubes of ice to the 1/2 cup water to chill it. Add the water 1 TBSP at a time and toss with a fork until the consistency seems right. I turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead it a few times - I find this is imperative to make the dough hold together and not crumble. I roll it out right away rather than chilling it first; I find that chilling it makes the dough too hard to work with and more prone to crumbling and breaking. This recipe makes the flakiest, most buttery and easy-to-manage pie crust ever! Five stars!

Very good pie crust....goes great with pumpkin pie.  The only thing I did differently was I brushed the crust with and egg white was before I filled it.

This was FABULOUS It was so easy to make and came together really well. I used the double recipe for Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and it was plenty. Thank you for such a delicious, beautiful, flaky pastry crust! I love it and will never look for another!

So delicious, i used two of this recipe for the crust and lattice top of "apple pie by grandma ople", and I covered the lattice top with foil for most of the baking time so it didn't burn.

i gave the recipe to some friends cuz they loved it!

Great crust.  I was skeptical b/c it seemed so simple, and when I tasted the dough it seemed a little salty (I did add a tiny bit of confectioner's sugar at that point), but the finished product was great.  It did not get soggy, did not interfere with the taste of the pie, and most certainly did not have the tang of manufactured flavor of the frozen pie crust I've always used!

Thanks for a great and easy recipe! This was my first try at a homemade pie crust and was amazed at how simple it was. Used "apple pie by Grandma Ople" recipe also from Allrecipes and it was so easy that I am making another today.

This turned out awesome. The crust was flaky and perfect. My one complaint is that it calls for too much water.  I added it one tablespoon at a time and barely used half of what was called for.  I also put my shortening in the freezer for a while beforehand and I think that helped.

Thank you so much.  Pie crust my mother-in-law will be jealous of!  This is now a staple of my recipe box, it's simple and delicious.  Following some other tips, I combine all dry ingredients, dump the shortening on top, then put the bowl and pastry blender in the fridge for an hour or so.  This has helped so much to make a flaky, crust, I love it!

Disaster. I have no idea what this person's motivation is other than to vastly increase the world's consumption of shortening. Use about half of what this person says, or better still, use another recipe, there are lots of them on AR.

Best Pie crust recipe ever!!  I have always avoided making Homemade pies because I didn’t want to deal with the crust. However, this recipe is crazy easy and It has come out perfect both times.
I have made apple and pumpkin pies, the crust did not burn at the edges, no need to wash with the egg white or cover the edges with foil.
 Just crazy easy and compliments the pies.
Forever saying  goodbye to using frozen pie crusts.

Great pie crust! Practically fool-proof and so easy to scale. Chill your ingredients, be sure to blend shortening/butter well before adding water. Don’t kneed it to death.

It was a good crust, easy to work with, but i felt it was a little too crunchy.  Would have wanted it a little softer.  But all in all it was a good crust.

Perfect! A note to remember (for me anyway), is to use the lowest oven rack when baking with an unbaked crust

This was a little too crunchy...I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, but I used this crust for the "Apple Pie I" It came out OK. The pie was good, but the crust was not as good as I hoped.

Add salt to water for even distribution and no salty places. I add a small amount of sugar and cinnamon to the crust before mixing.

This was the easiest pie crust. It was easy to roll oout. The texture was great. I have put more work in to other crusts in the past and this simple recipe is by far the best. I often avoid pie because I haven't had the best of luck with the crust. I used this recipe to make lemon meringue pie.

I actually haven't baked it yet, but it was easy to make and held together really well.  I was able to make a lattice design and use cookie cutters on it to make a leaf design around the rim.  Its worked very well so far.  Fingers crossed for the baking end of things.  Thanks for the recipe.

Handles beautifully, I always use 50/50 butter & lard. Try putting a pinch of dill in the flour when using for quiches or savoury.

I followed the directions exactly.  The ball of dough came out of the refrigerator hard as a rock.  It wouldn't roll.  My husband tried to roll it since he's tall and has greater leverage.  He tried and then said, "toss it."  Another recipe I have given up on.

This was so easy to make I will never buy store bought dough in the future. So very easy and tasted great. Thanks for the tip of rolling the dough and then unrolling it. I never would be able to do a casserole without this tip.

Crust was nice and tender. Used a little too much water, so it was a little soft, but it tasted great!

I love this simple recipe for pie crust, always turns out great.  The one change I make is 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 shortening instead of all shortening.  This is a keeper for me!

Very easy to make. I needed 3 crusts for my hubby’s pumpkin pie recipe, so I doubled the recipe. I was able to get 3- 8 3/4” pies from this. I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco to add some flavor. Great recipe!

I usually make a butter/shortening pie crust, but decided to try this recipe because I had leftover shortening and didn't want that to go bad. 

This is for me and okay recipe. It mixes easily, but even though I chilled everything before putting it together, then chilled after mixing, this seems to moist.  It sticks to the board I roll it on and is hard to put into the pie plate.  I think it is a) too much water and b) too much shortening. It's good after baked though and that is what counts in the long run I guess.

This is a nice, basic pie crust that is easy to make and makes a flaky pie crust.  It is very easy to work with.

This was a breeze to make. It came together perfectly. I was worried it would be too greasy, as some reviews said, and to be honest, it ddn’t look great at first. I divided it in half, refrigerated the two discs overnight, and threw a beautiful apple pie together the next day. I did add about a teaspoon of sugar. Next time I’ll add a couple more. I’d like to try this with all butter. Thanks for an ‘easy as pie’ recipe.

This is an easy reliable pie crust that is easy to work with.  The flavour is ok. I found it helpful to have the shortening at room temperature.

Wonderful!!!  I was like so many of you here--almost in tears every time I tried to make pie crust.
This time, it was so easy!  I was dancing around my house & ran outside to announce to my husband that I'm not afraid of making pie crust anymore!
Thanks so much!  Wonderful recipe! I used 8 TBS of ice water (still less than 1/2 cup) & shredded the 1/3 cup of  refrigerated butter that one of the ladies on this ratings area had suggested--saved me from sore back & arms by spending less time using the pastry knife. I also brushed the top of the pie I made with a beaten egg white--looked beautiful!

To start with, I'm a cooking rookie, but wanted to give this a try for a peach pie on my wish list. Since my pie involved a top crust, I added 50% to the ingredients. I should have doubled it. Don’t get me wrong, the crust was great, although I had to roll it pretty thin to have enough. If this was a single crust pie, the instruction are perfect, don’t change a thing. I’ve used all kinds of store-bought pie shells before. Many of them are very good, but the flakiness and flavor of this one was noticeably much better. I did use butter flavored shortening, though. I feel certain that if I can make this, anyone can. Bon Appétit

Quick and easy pie crust!  We are empty nesters, so I cut recipes way back to made mini pies for two.  I didn't need as much water as called for in the scaled back recipe.  Thanks for the recipe, Jan Bittner!

Was so simple and easy to make! We were in a rush and didn't have time to chill the crust and it still turned out great. Baked at 425F for about 15 minutes and was golden brown and flaky!

This is a remarkably good recipe. I made it once for a plum tart, but ti was slightly too dry (I think it was like this because I followed the advice of another review saying it was too greasy), otherwise good. I made it again today for a set of mini peach pies. Those are baking right now, but while we were rolling out the dough and such, it was VERY sticky and hard to work with.

Overall though, good recipe!

It came out wonderful! I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter . My wife made a great chicken pot pie with it. The crust tastes great and I'll be using this recipe for all of my pies from now on! 
Thanks for sharing it with me.

I used 7-up instead of water I think its more flaky I myself thinks it makes a better crust,also added 1 tsp of baking powder.

I have always been intimidated by making my own pie crust. Saw this recipe and got courageous enough to try it. Imade this with Crisco shortening.  Popped it in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Rolled it between pieces of wax paper .  Used a cup to make mini pie crusts and put them in large cupcake tins. Added my filling and cut pie crust cut into strips, placed on top in a lattice pattern.  Turned out very nice. Thanks for the recipe! I will use it again.  And I am no longer scared to make my own pie crusts. Woot woot!

All my life I have only made one pastry recipe: My Dad's. But now I live in China and don't have  convenient access to shortening or lard and made this recipe with butter.

 I actually used a hand mixer to knead it, and it actually made the gluten come out (read: stretchy) and it was the easiest pastry I have ever worked with, even when melding the scraps together for a second round of rolling. Super happy with the result, my butter tarts popped out of the non-stick pan with such ease and no breakage. Super flaky, perfection.  I will only use this recipe from now on.

This is so easy to make. It turns out flaky and yet not greasy. I used butter instead. Take butter straight out from the fridge, cut into tiny (5mm x 5mm) cubes. Blend with flour using a pastry cutter.  Add enough cold water to make it into a ball, roll out immediately. I did add a tiny bit of sugar. This will make a 9 inch pie. Will make this again and again.

This was the best crust I’ve ever had. The ratios of flour, shortening & water make such a big difference in flavor & texture. It also seemed easier to roll out too.

I had not made a pie crust in years and years!!! I was making Chicken Pot Pie and did not want to go to the store. I found this recipe what a great pie crust. I was so flaky and tender we were shocked. I had never made a pie crust like that before. I plan on making the pie crust for my pies Thanksgiving, it was that easy.

Before I comment, please note that I cook in metric and had to convert somethings -- I may have made some errors (not likely, but still a disclaimer).  

Using the portions instructed, my dough was way too sticky and watery ... I had to had a ton more dough to get it to hold to push into a pie tray.  The shortening made it taste too much like shortening ... I would pull back on the shortening a bit and the water next time around ... in the end it came out ok, but I'd made better crusts.  Again, it could just be me as I don't cook often, but I can follow directions.

I fancy myself as an experienced home cook who isn't afraid of a cooking challenge, but pie crust had me running from recipes for 30 years...until now! After many failed attempts and shameful results, I must admit, I was one to buy frozen pie crust (hiding it in the shopping cart until checkout). This recipe was a complete success! Simple, easy to follow, and has proven fool proof. I added iced water, 1 Tb at a time, until dough held together. It rolled out perfectly, baked up to flaky perfection, and tasted great! I will never shy from pie again!

So easy. I doubled the recipe and used my hands to mix like Paul Hollywood on the Great British Baking Show Master Class. I'll never use a tool for cutting in pie crust again. Also used Butter Flavored Crisco. This is the best crust I've made.

I ever tried MANY pie crust recipes. I thought I'd never find one I liked, and thought "Maybe I just don't like pie crust?" Never again! This recipe delivers flaky, soft, delicious crust Every. Single time. I only use butter because I prefer it over shortening. I have used this with pumpkin pie, Apple pie, chicken pot pie and shepherds pie. I don't par bake, because I think the softness is just phenomenal. Thank you for helping me know what I was missing out on!

I doubled this recipe (and instead of using 1 cup of shortening, I used 1/2 C. shortening and 1/2 C. cold butter).  I used about 1/3 C. water, and think I should use more next time; it split a little as I was rolling it out.  Otherwise, a very good recipe; I used a pastry blender and it came together easily, rolled out easily. May try adding 1 TBLS sugar next time.  It made the necessary amount of dough for my amateur rolling skills. :)

I followed the directions except for letting the dough side in the fridge a few minutes before and after rolling it. It turned out great. The crust is flaky and delicious. It was the best pie crust recipe I've come across.

I double the recipe since I was making two deep dish pies. I made sure I used ice water and put the dough in the fridge while I mixed the filling. I rolled out and put in pie plate and put in fridge for about 15 minutes.  Turned out wonderful.

Im giving it a three star rating for the great story behind the recipe and the fact that it's a nice crisp pastry.  I found it bland and too much resembling (in taste) it's stripped down ingredients. 

I used it for a cherry pie and feel if this were used, it would be best for a savoury, very flavourful  meat pie such as tortierre.  

 I'm one who struggles with pastry and will keep looking for a no fail that has a little more richness to it.

the texture of the crust was good, flaky, just the right amount of crisp, but the flavor was all shortening.  won't be using this recipe again.

I made this with lard because that's what I had on hand.  I put it on a chicken pot pie.  I always mix crust with my hands.  It was very flaky and delicious.  It was the best crust I've ever made.

Good start! Light & flakey, more than enough for my 10" deep dish pie pan. I only ended up using about 1/4 cup of the water, but that was probably because my shortening was warm. The dough was a bit bland - needed more salt. This was an easy recipe, so I'll try again & be more careful with my measurements!

It is the best Pie Crust I have ever tried, you can feel the perfection the moment you finish adding the water, it is a hit!!
I only added about two tablespoons of confectioner's sugar to give it a bit of sweetness

Used this crust for chicken potpie. Made a bottom and top crust with this recipe. Changed nothing.  Used iced water, but I used probably about 1/2 cup of water total for both crusts.

This recipe is very good.  The crust was flaky and delicious.  I used half Crisco and half butter, but I think next time I'll try all butter.  And I think it would be better with a little sugar added.  But there were no complaints, and I think it's really very good as is.  And also, it's easy.

I used real butter,  worked very well.  I added a little bit of sugar about 1 1/2 tsp.  and about 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  More of a cookie flavor for the pumpkin pie.

very similar to my Grandmother's recipe...except for single pie crust I use 1C. flour 1/2 C. Crisco, and a scant 1/4 C. of cold water.   Lightly roll out on floured cotton cloth. Gently fold in half and place in pie shell. For fruit pies I sprinkle the dough with a little sugar. I would also recommend poking holes with the tines of a dinner fork all over bottom and on sides of pie plate to reduce shrinkage. Bake at 450 degrees for 10 min.

Excellent pie crust, first time I've ever made a pie crust, my  wife was in awe as it came out perfectly.  I used plenty of flour over wax paper, and rolling pin, which again worked perfectly.  I then rolled it over the wood rolling pin, and applied it to the pie plate.

Nice pie crust...  Not flaky, but not crumbly either.  Very easy to make!  I did use butter flavored shortening, and that gave it a nice buttery flavor.  I will be using this regularly.

I made no changes and this crust was flaky and perfect!  I used it for chicken pot pie and it was  fabulous!! Everyone loved it! I froze some of the pot pies and microwaved them a week or so later.  The crust was beautiful and as flaky as it was whenI used it fresh.  Then, I used it to make fried pie,  expecting it to be oily and gummy.  It was just as wonderful!  And the next day it was not oily or heavy and microwaved perfectly.   The fried pies were a little fragile due to the flakiness, but it still held up and everyone raved about them!

This is the ONLY pie crust I've ever had real success with. The key is to add only just enough water and not to over handle. Comes out perfect just like a crust should. Not too hard, not overly crumbly.

this recipe is a no fail recipe. what ever tools you have, it works perfectly. if u use a pastry blender, fork, food processor, or even your hand, you'll get good results. you can substitute the shortening with butter and it works great. i like the fact that you dont have to freeze it, but if you want to, it tastes just as great!

Always perfect, never fails. I've never made just one pie crust with this, I'm always doubling or quadrupling it at least, and I always seem to have way more dough than I need. Last time I quadrupled it for four pie crusts, and actually got 3 double crust pies out of it.

Yay! My mom said, "You only have 10 minutes to put that pie together." It took me a little longer to do the pumpkin...but not much!!! I don't recommend microwaving the butter but I was in a rush and did and it still worked out wonderful. I didn't use ice. I can see how someone could add sugar for some sweetness or orange juice instead of water..but my family liked it. It was light and fluffy. I barely handled it...barely mixed it all together...it went together quickly...

I use this recipe every time. Don't tell my grandmother, but I it tastes better than even her pie crust. The only change I make is I substitute rendered beef fat for the shortening. Yum!

I use this recipe to make mini apple pies an electric pie maker. It was quick, easy, and came out very flaky and tasty. I especially like that the dough did not have to be refrigerated for any time to rest before rolling and baking. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.  I'm looking forward to trying butter instead of shortening. Thanks so much.

I have tried all versions of the popular pie crust recipes on the site, and I have yet to master crust making.  I know that the fault is with my lack of experience and technique rather than the recipes.   I tried this recipe yesterday, and it was easier to work with than most.  The most difficult part for me is moving the dough to the pan, so thank you to the reviewer who suggested rolling it out in parchment paper.  That made it so much easier!

This worked out gorgeously. It didn't take me that long to whip up,  it tasted awesome and the recipe was very versatile. I can't really see how you can go wrong with this- If it's crumble-ey, add more water. If you add a little too much and it's too moist, rub it with some flour and use it for the top crust. I recommend making two separate batches- first batch for the bottom crust and the second batch for the top crust. 
This is my go-to recipe for crusts! Don't ask me why you'd wanna (impulse, maybe?), but this crust also works/tastes well with flavorings added. I added butter flavoring and it was pretty good!

This crust is so great. It compliments all kinds of pie filling. When I baked my first apple pie, thought the pie filling is a little bit disastrous but the crust make up on my failure.

I tried another pie crust recipe from this site about a month ago, and was not impressed.  But this one right here!!!!  Ooh wee, I enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently was use butter shortening like someone else suggested, which gave it a nice buttery taste.  I didn't end up using all of the cold water, so I'm glad I paid attention and didn't just pour it all in.  I baked up a sweet potato pie using a recipe that i've used here in the past.  Was truly a nice pairing.  I will definitely keep using this pie crust recipe.

I don't have the patience to "toss carefully with a fork", so I just mixed the ingredients in my bosch mixer. I ended up using a few Tbsp more flour, but the dough was easy to handle after that.

Very good pie crust. I used it in Warm Apple Buttermilk Custard pie from this site. The crust was just perfect: not very flaky and not too dry. I will definitely use this crust for some kind of pies.

Loved this recipe! Used golden crisco and followed directions and it was amazing! With any crust recipe though the trick is to handle it as little as possible! Will be using this one from now on! Thank you for a great recipe!

I make this often and it is always wonderful!  I prefer butter over shortening and oftentimes use a mixture of fresh ground pastry flour with some organic white flour, but either way, it's a perfect pie crust...simple, flaky and delicious.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was delicious!  And didn't fall apart when I transferred it into the pie pan.  It will definitely be my 'go-to' pie crust recipe!

First pie crust that I I have made that turned out perfect! Went right from rolling into pie pan! Worked perfectly for quiche on Christmas morning and can't wait to make apple pie with it. Wish I would have taken a photo

Easy. A little tough, but that's probably my fault. Still beats frozen.

I used salted butter because it was all I had. After years of attempting to make a decent pie crust, I have found a perfect one. I agree the less you fuss with it the better it is. It's probably even better with unsalted butter like the recipe calls for. I also used Grandma Olpe's Apple Pie recipe from his site. I added a little cinnamon. Perfection!
They had to know what they were doing during the Depression. Thanks for sharing.

My first time EVER making pie crust, and this came out great! I don't think I rolled it thin enough, I wasn't sure how thin it ought to be, but it was still flaky and delicious, and really quite easy! Thanks!

Love this crust! It was really easy to make and it turned out delicious. Definitely use the solid shortening sticks, and I didn't have time to put it in the fridge so I used it at room temp. I used a fork to push it into the flour mixture and that worked great. Mashed it with the fork until it looked crumbly. I measured out my cold water and put an ice cube in it to keep it cold, and then added the water a tablespoon at a time, mixing with my fork until the mixture was a little crumbly looking still but I could push it easily together with my fingers. I didnt use all of the water, maybe 2/3 to 3/4 of it. Then I formed the dough together with my hands and rolled it out. I couldn't find a rolling pin so I used a pint glass rubbed with a little flour. I buttered my baking dish a just a little before I laid the dough, which I probably didn't need to do with all of the shortening in the dough, so it probably just added a little more flavor. Then I made a second one to use as a top crust (for Grandma Oples apple pie recipe on this site) and I put the top crust in the fridge while I made the rest of the pie. This crust turned out so great I am going to use it for all my pies!

I've always had a hard time making pie crust. I hate it and it hates me.
This pie crust actually likes me. Fast, easy, and it doesn't crumble apart as soon as I try to put it in the plate.
I use homemade oat flour to roll it out. It adds a nice texture and prevents the crust from being to floury (another common mistake of mine). 
I wont be making anymore pies without this recipe at my side.

This is my first time baking a pie and I made an apple pie using this recipe for the crusts and the Grandma Ople recipe for the filling. The crusts was super flaky and tender, just like a pastry crust. My kids think this crust is better than the Marie Callender's pie crust (from the restaurant). Now that's a compliment as we all love MC's pies! I gave a slice to a friend, and she loved it so much that she immediately asked for the recipe.

This crust was so easy to make! The changes I made was I used half all-purpose flour and half cake/pastry flour (low gluten flour). I also put the dough in the fridge for half an hour before rolling it.

I tried this recipe yesterday for a pumpkin pie. I followed the directions exactly and even some of the common suggestions in the reviews and it turned out dense and chewy, definitely not light and flaky.  It was edible but not enjoyable.  Most of us just ate the pie filling out of the shell and left the crust - hey it saved me from consuming several calories and fat grams!  I will try one of the other recipes listed instead next time.

Perfect every time. Makes more than enough for one crust, but not enough for a bottom and a top.

Tip: Use plastic wrap if you don't have a pastry cloth - drip some water on one sheet, sprinkle a tablespoon of flour on it, then place on sheet on top of it, roll into ball and work with it as you normally would. This crust is awesome - I rolled it super thin and it still held its shape.

This is an awesome pie crust recipe.  Not too much trouble as so many other pie crust recipes are.  I had decided making pie crusts from scratch was not worth the effort, but one night I needed a pie crust and didn't have one.  I found this one, and even substituted a stick of margarine for shortening since that is what I had (as another reviewer suggested) and it is GREAT!  I've make this recipe twice now and LOVE it!  Now I don't have to worry about keeping pie crusts on hand!  They are usually expensive and broken anyway!!!!

I usually use a crust recipe using half butter and half shortening.  I couldn't find the recipe so I used this one.  I will use this recipe from now on for everything.  Very light and flaky crust.  Received lots of compliments!

This is my first crust from scratch and my apple pie recipe called for a 9" double pie crust which considering my baking knowledge wasn't very helpful. This recipe had enough dough not only to do the base but also for the lattice top that I needed for the pie. I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes. A reviewer suggested adding some sugar if it was to be used for a fruit pie but I don't think it needed it at all. My crust did start to get dark half way throughout the cooking time so I just lightly draped aluminum foil over the top to prevent it from burning and it came out perfect. This will be my go to crust not only for fruit pies, probably also for chicken pot pies too.

Classic, awesome crust. Easy to work with. I will probably use this for my standard crust from now on. I chilled it in the fridge for a 1/2 hour- makes it flakier I've heard. Thanks for a great, easy, CHEAP recipe!

Excellent, basic, single-pie crust recipe that really should be called never-fail pie crust. I did it in the food processor, and it was done in about 30 seconds. It rolled out beautifully, was stretchy and pliable, and easy to work with. Thanks for this excellent go-to recipe!

The original recipe is only a 4 because I hated the way it tasted/came together with the vegetable shortening. Flaky and all but it was bland and gross. I made it again with butter and it was WAY better! If you're going to use it for a fruit pie, make sure you add 2 Tbls of sugar.

made mt first pie using this crust [grandma ople's apple pie off this site] and it turned out great. Though...since it was my first pie, I didnt understand when to stop adding water. I mushed it together with my hand at one point because I felt like I added enough but the dough wasnt forming a ball or seeming held together. when I mushed it with my hands, it became obvious it was ready. Very good, simple, and flaky.

I used butter instead of shortening and I thought it could have been a little sweeter. I think next time when I roll it out to mix powered sugar with the flour. I wasn't as flaky as I had hoped, but after reading the reviews I think I messed up not using cold butter and using softened butter.

My rating is based on ease to work with and the aesthetic aspect of the finished product as I didnt taste this for dietary reasons. But this was soo easy and beautiful, I was just shocked. Seems well worth just a couple extra minutes in the kitchen compared to a premade crust! Thanks!

This was just ok to me. I used it in a pie but I think it would be better for a pot pie. I doesn't have any flavor. I think next time I will add some vanilla and cinnamon (for a pie).

This was an extremely easy recipe for homemade pie crust! I'm a teenager and wanted to make a homemade crust for my pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. I sure did pick the right recipe. It's in the oven right now and smells oh so good. The only thing I changed about it was using a stick of butter instead of shortening because that's what I had in the fridge. I'm betting it will be a complete success!

I must have done something terribly wrong because I did not care for this crust at all. I believe I followed the recipe exactly, but the pie smelled and tasted like straight shortening (although the consistency of the crust was perfect). We ended up eating the filling out of the pie and not even touching the crust.   I can only imagine that somehow I used too much shortening (although I'm not sure how that's possible); but I've used other crust recipes that were delicious and very forgiving, so I'll stick with those.

My favorite pie crust!!  I add about 2 Tbsps of sugar to it when I make it for desserts and use the salt when I make it for savory dishes like chicken pot pie.  It is light, flakey and delicious!  I make it, wrap it in plastic wrap & chill it in the fridge for about 20 minutes while I prepare my filling.  I've made this with butter instead of shortening and it's fabulous!  Thank you!

I can't believe how beautiful this turned out! My first pie crust was a complete failure and crumbled to pieces.  My 2nd - using this recipe - made it into the pie dish without so much as a crack.  Thanks so much for sharing!

A really flaky, great pie crust !!  If you're doing a two crust pie, you'll need to double the recipe.  I used half butter and half Crisco and it was great.  Also, drop some ice cubes into a one cup measuring cup then top with water.  After it's sat for a few minutes, the water is perfect to use.  This crust is super easy to use if you roll it into a ball and chill it for a few hours first.  Then, take it out of the fridge and let is sit for a few minutes before you roll it out so that it doesn't 'crack'.   I have to say...if you're using this on a savory pie/casserole, it's perfect as written.  For a sweet pie?  I stir about 4 tbs of powdered sugar into the flour before I mix it with the shortening.  It just NEEDS that wee bit of sweetness.

I used half unsalted butter and half shortening for the fat, and a bit less water (as little as I could get away with) and found it came out very good, though next time I'll add a little confectioners sugar.  Had a little trouble making a lattice top, but that was most likely inexperience on my part.

I made this crust recipe today for 2 double crust pies - it was the easiest crust to roll out and it is very flaky.  I add the water in small amounts and mix after each addition because I have found that sometimes you do not need all the water.  Dough needs to be soft by not sticky.

I was making a blueberry pie for my husbands birthday, and after throwing out a crust made from a popular cookbook, I found this one.  I can't believe that a crust can be easy to roll out, handle into the pan and still be flaky and tasty! The only thing to know if you are not familiar with crusts is that you may not need to add all the water.  Thank you, thank you!!!

Very good - not fantastic. I used butter flavored shortening, and that really helped with the flavor. I also sprinkled white sugar onto the top crust before putting into the oven. I found this dough to be VERY sticky. There was absolutely no way I could do anything other than make a normal top crust (like good luck if you want to do a lattice). I did put the dough in the fridge over night, too, so it's not that it wasn't cold. Maybe more flour would have helped? The crust was tasty, but it definitely wasn't flaky. I was find with that, but if you want flaky then don't use this recipe.

Amazing. Better than store bought pie crust. I only had butter on hand and it worked well (I put the butter in the microwave for about 10 seconds because it was pretty solid from coming directly out of the fridge.) The recipe as written barely covered my 9" pie plate top and bottom so I might double it next time.

Great recipe.  I hate making pie crust so much but this wasn't bad at all.  Added ice water one Tbs at a time and tossed lightly with a fork after each Tbs (it will start to bind into a ball) - ended up with 4 Tbs - held together nicely and still tasted delicate:)    I used it to make Pie Crust Cookies, just brushed with butter, sprinkled with 3 Tbs of brown sugar and sprinkle with a mixture of cinnamon, ginger and cloves (you could also use apple /pumpkin pie spice) before popping into the over for around 10 min. a@400 degrees.  MMMMMMM!!  I can't stop eating them!

My first pie crust I ever made.  It was much easier than I expected (still trying to get the hang of rolling it out).  My family was impressed and loved the taste of it with my favorite pumpkin pie recipe.

While I have tasted better pie crusts in my day, this one was extremely easy to work with and very functional. Usually my pie crusts crumble or are too hard to work with, therefore end up too thich....this one looked great and held up great.

The crust looked beautiful but was a bit chewy and didn't seem to brown enough on top and the edges burned. I brushed a little milk on the top crust and the rim. Next time I will add a little bit of sugar. Will use this recipe again.

Very good. I usually use a different recipe, and I usually use lard. While lard makes for a lighter, flakier pastry, the flavour of lard is usually kind of gamy. I might do a half-lard, half-shortening blend next time, but it was a very good crust for our pumpkin pie. Thanks for sharing, Jan!

The crust was very tasty and easy, but there's no way you will ever use a full 1/2 cup of water. I used 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 shortening and only a 1/4 cup of ice cold water (I filled a big bowl with ice cubes and measured out of the bowl), plus maybe another teaspoon water. I was using my food processor - pulse flour/salt and butter/shortening until it forms pea sized pieces, then add the water until it forms a ball. Again, don't over process the dough. As soon as it forms a ball, wrap it up and put it in the fridge.

Made this for an apple pie an worked pretty well. Extremwely inexperienced pie maker This is a lame review as I can't give a detailed description of how it turned out..but there were no complaints =) Soo that's always good. For ease though I think I'll stick with the no roll so I don't have to mess with the constant refridgeration an rolling pin. Thanks though!! Looked nice =)

Great pie crust!  Fast and easy and - most importantly - delicious!  I made mine using butter-flavored Crisco and it was one of the best crusts I've made in a very long time.  This is my new go-to crust recipe.

VICTORY!!!! Finally a crust that was successful, not only in making it but it was very tasty as well. Like another reviewer, I too used half butter and half shortening. This will be my new go to crust recipe.

I rate this recipe a 5 stars. But I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I didn't use the salt. I ues this recipe with the Sweet Potato Pie by Cougaar off this web site.

I never made pie crust from scratch before last night. I used this pie crust recipe and used butter flavored shortening (because it was all I had) It was the best pie crust I've ever had! (I was very impressed with myself!)  I didn't have a pie cloth so I used wax paper (top and bottom) to roll the crust and it worked perfectly. I will never stray from this recipe!

I only ended up using half of the water listed. Adding one tablespoon at a time, it looked like it was wet enough so I stopped adding water before I ruined it. This was SO easy to work with, a no-fail recipe. I can't wait to make another one now!

Followed the instructions to a "T".  It is a VERY BLAND pie crust without much flavor.  The store bought are better.  I will not use this again.

I've made this several times, and for my tastes I like to double the recipe for a double thick crust.  Also, to get the butter flavor but shortening flakiness, try butter flavored crisco.

I've used this pie crust many times for many recipes.  I like it best with butter flavored shortening, and celery salt for a savory pie, or a little nutmeg or cinnamon for a fruit pie.  It is fabulous as is.  You can't go wrong.

This was fantastic! I tripled it for 2 pies I was making (a double crust and a single), and had no problems with it. Very easy to work with, very soft dough. It came out so beautifully, light and flaky and very tasty! I will definitely use this again. I made it for Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and Old Fashioned Coconut Cream Pie. I really like using the butter flavored crisco in this too - gives it an extra rich buttery flavor!

What a great recipe! I had abolsolutely NO problems with rolling it out or anything. It was so smooth!  I didn't have shortening, so I used 1 stick of butter, and I also used 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. I also added 1/3 cup extra wheat to make it a little firmer.   This was great with the broccoili quiche I made! My boyfriend (who never eats the crust of a pie) said that it was great!

This crust was delicious and easy to make. Light and flaky. I didn't have a rolling pin so I used a bottle of wine, which was kind of annoying but it still came out. It isn't a sweet crust, I'd probably add sugar if I was making it for a dessert. I used it for chicken pot pie and it was great. I also didn't need the whole amount of water, I just added a couple tablespoons at a time till it was a good consistency. And I didn't need to use ice water or refrigerate it before using it in my recipe. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's only the first one like this I've made, but it was really really good.

Pie crust was flaky and supportive to a juicy berry pie.  I added the water slowly and found I only needed 1/4 cup so make sure you follow the recipe.

Good recipe! You need to double it for a 26 cm (10 inches and 1/2 approximately) pie. I like a thick crust, personally :)

I have been on the search for a pie crust that works for me for years and this one has finally ended my search.  I have used this pie crust recipe several times now and every time the crust comes out perfect.  It rolls out beautifully and once baked results in a flaky, tender crust.  I have made both single and double crust pies with this recipe and all have turned out perfect.  Thank you for finally putting an end to my pie crust frustration!

Fantastic crust! I used butter flavored crisco--which I didn't like so much, but that wasn't an issue. I didn't have time to refrigerate it fully---but it still came out nicely. The dough seemed a tad sticky at first--but when I added flour to roll it out, it was beautiful. I'd definitely do this recipe again :) Doubling the recipe was perfect for my deep dish pie plate too. Thanks Jan!

Fantastic!  I'm usually horrible with pie crusts but this one was really easy for me!  I ended up only using about a 1/4 of a cup of water though.

This is a great Pie Crust recipe.  It's a very easy dough to use.  I normally have trouble with crusts, but not with this recipe.  The first time I used it, I ended up making 1 large double crust pie, and 6 small double crust pies.

I made this today for a strawberry rhubarb pie. I followed the directions for a doubled recipe (using veg shortening). I used my regular old food processor. I found that I only needed about a half cup of ice water for the recipe to stick properly. This recipe didn't need any sugar added for an already sugary pie, it was flaky and good. I did wet the top a bit with water and sprinkle sugar on it to make it look pretty :).

Mine turned out PERFECT.  I sliced up a stick of butter instead of shortening and since I do not have a pastry blender I used 2 butter knives to cut the butter into the flour, I also used wheat flour *same taste, much healthier*.  I did not use ice water, just cool water and it worked out fine.  After I had most of the water in I used my hands to mix it up and roll it out.  Then after it was rolled out I did not fold it in half to get it in the dish, I carefully rolled it around my rolling pin and unrolled it over the dish, worked out GREAT!!  I used it for a strawberry pie so I definately didn't need to add any sugar to it.

I found the amount of water to be way too much.  The dough was too wet and sticky and was still too soft for my taste at the bottom after cooking.  I'm going back to my original recipe (the one on the Crisco box).

I made this one night for a quiche -- my 1st time making a pie crust. This recipe is great and cooks up light and flaky.  I won't be using ready-made crusts ever again!

This makes a lovely pie crust, its light and flaky, I like to keep the butter and water as cold as possible before making it, I find it makes it flakier.  Also to rest the dough at least 20 minutes before rolling.  This is definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again, the three stars are because I did a few things different than as the recipe was written

I had never made a pie before and I decided to use this recipe as my pie crust. It was extremely easy to make and the crust turned out perfectly. Wouldn't change a thing to the original recipe.

This is a GREAT basic pie crust recipe. My secret is to put all of the ingredients in the freezer a few minutes before making the crust as well as treating it lightly. The real trick to a flaky crust is not letting the fat mix completely into the flour mixture.

I use this recipe for chicken pot pie. This pie crust is delicious with a few alterations. I use butter because I find it gives the crust more flavor otherwise it's pretty bland. I also mix in some Italian seasonings.

I usually buy the refrigerated ready made pie crust, but didn't have any tonight and I wanted to make Chicken Pot Pie IX.  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I think it's better than the store bought and I think it's easier to handle than any I've ever made.  I'll make this recipe instead from now on.

I used this crust to make Irish beef pies (a recipe I got from a magazine) and it was the best part of the meal!  I used it again today to make a pie, but I haven't tried that yet.  It is so easy to make and sooo delicious!

mmmmmmmmmm like Grandma's.   makes a lot for a one pie thing, but I improvised and used the rest for a lattice.  Also, I don't keep shortening (bad me), and I used margarine instead... voila!   A very forgiving basic pie crust recipe.  The girls at work just love it when I come in carrying one :)

Very good.. I used these for Apple Dumplings with Rich Cinnamon Sauce from this sight. I did double the recipe and it was perfect for 8 apple halves.. I didn't have to use the full 1 cup of water when I doubled it. I used maybe 3/4 of a cup.. Thank you for sharing.

I didn't have a rolling pin, and it still came out perfectly flaky, even, and delicious! I used it for grandma ople apple pie, and latticed the crust with an egg wash on top. It came out perfectly.

I have searched everywhere for that perfect pie crust and here it is. The dough is easy to work with, makes enough for 2 pies and comes out flaky and delicious. I used ice cold water and refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes after making it but that is something that should be done anyways when making any kind of pie dough.

very easy to make. i baked at 400degrees for 10min prior to using this for my lemon meringue pie. i had some problems w/ moisture in the pie so the crust at the bottom was all dense and mushy. the fluted parts tasted fairly good.

This was my first attempt at making my own pie crust, and I must say I have been consistently happy with this recipe. I've used it with my apple pies and it's always come out just beautifully. The taste is what I consider a perfect pie crust. I plan on trying it with a pot pie soon and am sure it'll be just as awesome!

Wonderfully tender and flaky crust. Couldn't be happier with the results. I used just a little less then l/2 cup of water. Handling the dough as little as possible is what makes it so tender and flaky, so be sure to not overwork the dough.

This is a supremely tasty, very flaky pie crust!  I've made it twice so far- first I made as directed for a French Silk Pie and it was the perfect foil for all the sweet chocolatey goodness, and the second time today, with a cherry pie.  This time I wanted it a touch sweet, so I added two level T of confectioner's sugar (I doubled the recipe for a top crust), and it was delicious. The advice of others to make sure that your fat is nice and cool, and that you don't overwork the dough is spot on.  Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

Wonderful crust!!  

Next time, I'll triple the recipe as for me when I doubled it, it wasn't enough for a 2-crusted pie.

I love this recipe!!! I'd never had any luck with pie crusts but decided to try it again this year because the store bought crusts I've gotten have been so blah. This recipe was super easy. I've never buying a crust again! I did use ice water and cold butter-flavored shortened, refrigerated the dough before rolling out, and again before placing the filling in it. It turned out great.

I usually don't like to make pie crust, but this one was super easy! I got consistent results each time I made it. I did substitute whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour.

Perfect crust recipe. Add cold water 1 tbsp at a time until it holds together. Don't make to moist. If too moist add flour 1 tbsp at a time. Perfect for one bottom of pie.

This was a great recipe. I wanted something easy that produced a flakier and less "floury" than other homemade crust recipes, and this delivered.

I made sure to get the mix VERY crumbly before adding COLD water one Tbsp. at a time. The result was wonderfully easy to work with--not sticky at all.

The only thing I might try differently next time is to add a tad of sugar with the flour. It did not taste bad as is, but I like sweets!

This crust was very easy to make if you are experienced with making crusts.  I cannot imagine using as much water as it calls for, though.  I used about 6 tbsps of ice water like I usually do for crusts -- that worked perfect.  I just add 1 tbsp at a time until the consistency is right.  You want it to be just moist enough to make one big ball easily with your hands.  I used Butter-Flavored Shortening for more flavor.  I will use this recipe again.  May try with half real butter next time for better flavor.

This was my first time making pie crust so with practice I'm sure it will get better. But it turned out pretty good for the first time. I used margarine instead of shortening and used it to make a chicken pot pie. SO GOOD, can't wait to make it again!

I always use butter instead of shortening which makes for the perfect crust. Except this time when I used butter flavored shortening and it was awesome!

I'm rating this a 4 for now because my crust turned out salty. I did use salted butter instead of shortning though then added the salt that was asked. Other then that it was perfect. Nice and flaky, easy to make. I will definately give this one another try and either not add the salt or use shortning.

Got great flavor & consistency adding a bit of powdered sugar and substituting half the shortening with butter, which was added as frozen by grating to minimize melting while working the crust.

This was the easiest pie crust dough I've ever made and worked with. I scaled it down to 8 servings because I wasn't using it to make a pie. I made what my mom always called "little things". I rolled out the dough and spread margarine all over it and sprinkled sugar, then cinnamon all over it. I then rolled it up and cut into little pinwheels. Baked in the oven at 325 degrees for 8-10 minutes. They were great! This crust made them so perfect! Next time I make a pie this is the crust I'm using for sure!

Here's a secret to help with a flaky crust... let your shortening sit in ice water for a few minutes before you work it into the flour.  After you work the shortening into the flour, stick it in the freezer for 5 minutes or so.  Then add in the ice water a table spoon at a time.  Perfect crust.  Thanks for the recipe.

Nice, quick and easy. Really nice to work with but it did end up having a really floury taste after baking. Used it for rhubarb pie and it held up really nicely. Might experiment with other recipes but this works in a pinch.

Great, Easy recipe.  It is so easy to make especially with my Kitchenaid (using the flat beater).  I used this recipe to make Beef Empanadas and they are great and flaky.  I substituted butter for margarine.  It's oh so buttery.  I will add a little sugar to make the crust a little sweeter next time.

Tried this when I needed a dairy-free crust. I only used about 3 TBS of the water and my pie crust was quite wet so I stopped there. My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't state how much crust it makes or how to cook the crust. It seemed like it would make two very small thin crusts so I used all of it for one thick crust and it took nearly 20 min. to cook at 400 (if you can even imagine). Also added 1 TBS of sugar to the dry ingredients.

Easy to make and roll. The key is using a pastry cloth (I've even used a pillow case before) as it makes it easier to turn the dough into a pie pan and doesn't leave a mess on your countertop.

Very good! The filling I made was really bad but the crust was very good! I might try to tweak it a bit but it's a nice start.

Very easy and ok for an otherwise sweet custard-like pie (I used it for pumpkin and sweet potato pie).
