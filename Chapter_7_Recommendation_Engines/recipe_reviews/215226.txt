I was intimidated @ first with making this dish because my husbands mother is Honduran and makes it...So I felt under pressure to make it taste as good..My husband tasted it and said it was better than his mother's! I loved it. I left out the capers as well and used skirt steak...I also saw to late that the recipe called for minced garlic so i substituted 2 teaspoons garlic powder.

This was time consuming but worth it! It smelled great and the meat was so tender and delicious! The only Goya ingredients I used were Adobo, Sazon, and capers. My can opener broke so I did could not use tomato sauce and subbed with ketchup instead.  Also I used my own home-made sofrito (FIVEBRIGS recipe on this site). I did not have olives so omitted it.  I know this is not traditional but I love potatoes and carrots with this beef so I added some diced pieces to the pot during last 30 min of cooking. Word of caution, braising the beef caused a lot of smoke and oil splatter.  Not sure if this step is necessary.  Also, if your pot gets black at the bottom like mine did after cooking the beef, deglaze with some wine or water and clean with a paper towel and you're in business again. I paired this with Puerto Rican steamed rice by FIVEBRIGS on this site.  Also had the Goya frozen maduros but will make my own next time.

I did not add the capers and I did not use all goya products for this recipe. But this recipe was great. Very flavorful. I love cilantro so I used a LOT of cilantro. It was very easy to make as well.

I made it tonight and it was really good!  I started to worry that the olives and capers were overpowering the flavor but once I added the cilantro it evened out and was so tasteful!

Ropa Vieja Haiku: "Just finished a bowl. Big props to Goya's kitchen. They nailed this meat stew!" I actually had nearly all of the Goya products on hand, except I had several ice-cubes' worth of frozen homemade Sofrito that needed to be used. Left out the capers (can't stand 'em) and after browning the steak and sauteeing the veggies, I tossed everything in the crock-pot on low for 8 hrs. About half-way thru, I removed the steak and shredded it, and added a much heavier handful of cilantro (c'mon Goya - 1 TB??) prior to serving. My husband ate his (scooped w/ a slotted spoon) in a corn tortilla, while I ate mine slurpy-soupy-style. The flavor isn't intense, but it's unusual enough that I would definitely make this again, although I think next time, I would consider adding some sweet potatoes, or some kind of additional veggie for more stew-ey substance, along w/ a diced chipotle or jalapeno for a little blaze.

Goya, you never cease to amaze me! I had no idea what to expect from this recipe since I had never had Ropa Vieja before, but I can see making this over and over again! It is so full of flavor. I wouldn't change a thing. I made the recipe exactly as written and I'd recommend not omitting the olives or capers, unless you're totally opposed to them or deathly afraid. They really make the dish! I didn't have to add any seasonings at the end, the flavor was just perfect.  If you're thinking the consistency looks too thin, wait until you shred the meat...that really thickens it up. The house smelled amazing while this was cooking. A keeper!

I've had ropa viega before and this was way better. I was a little skectical of using 3C water so I added 2 and when I lifted the cover to the pot, there was still a lot of liquid left. So during the last half hour as I was shredding the beef, I let the sauce simmer to thicken up and gain flavor (I didnt want a soupy texture) and it came out great. I also used a large beef broth goya cube. 
AND BTW, this recipe doesnt mention which sofrito to use. Theres a cilantro based and a tomato based. I used a little bit of both but since there was already a tomato flavor from the tomato sauce, the cilantro is fine since you should add some fresh cilantro anyway at the end.

I was being lazy so I finished this in a slow cooker - I used a 2lb chuck roast & left it as is (don't need to) & browned meat in very little oil, approx 1 TBS, until it was nicely seared (if you heat your pan correctly before cooking anything, you don't need much oil and food won't stick to the pan...also, no oil splatter); dumped in my crock pot then saut√©ed veggies in remaining oil & added garlic once it softened a bit and cooked 1 min (or until I smell the garlic) before adding to crock pot; dumped everything else, except olives & capers, and cooked on high 2 hours; added olives, capers & cooked for another 2 hours on high before adding cilantro (I used way more, like a handful, because what's written won't do much flavor-wise... and, I had a bunch chopped already from making cilantro rice already) and let it finish on low until I felt like getting up and serving the family dinner (probably 30-45 min, maybe an hour). Served with cilantro rice, some Puerto Rican-style beans, and a bacalao salad (my pops-in-law is from San Juan, PR so I learned to cook a lot of Puerto Rican food).

Also, I'd like to correct a previous comment: There's only ONE sofrito (it's the red, tomato-based cooking base). The green, culantro-based cooking base is called RECAITO (which is what I used for the rice). Side note, culantro is NOT the same as cilantro, nor is it used to describe cilantro-culantro is an herb I associate with pho because it's part of the veg/herb plate that comes with a bowl of

I could not find sofrito, so I made some using a recipe on this site, otherwise, followed the recipe.  One thing that I did change was the amount of water.  It calls for 3 cups (not in the ingredient listing) which I felt was going to be excessive, so I used 2 cups, which turned out to be just about right.   Wonderful, full-bodied flavors in this stew with fork-tender beef.  Served with Goya's recipe for Black Beans & Rice.

Last week I went over to my local Cuban restaurant and had their Ropa viega sandwich and was kind of craving it. I always look to Goya for their recipes. I used pretty much all the ingredients except for the Goya Sofrito, sorry Goya, but I can't stand their bottled sofrito so I used fresh Sofrito in place I also left out the capers because I didn't have any on hand. I also didn't use the Goya bouillon I used the Knorr one instead. Over all this dish was great. I made black beans and white rice to go along with it.

This was delicious. My husband kept saying over and over again how this was one of the most delicious things he has ever tasted. That's huge coming from that man. 

I omitted the olives, but only because my family wouldn't have ate it if I did add them. However, I would have loved them in this dish. I added a lot more garlic then it called for and some more of the Adobo seasoning on the finished product. It was good before, but just a slight bland without a little more seasoning for my taste. The cooking time is perfect too. I used skirt steak that I sliced into strips. I let it simmer on low heat for 1.5 hours and the meat melted in your mouth. I served this on white rice and with some corn on the side. Don't let the list of ingredients scare you. It's not a hard dish to make at all! Plus I found all my Goya products at my local Krogers in the Hispanic aisle (although if you can find or make similar, you can substitute, but I LOVE Goya, so I don't).

This was ahhhhhmazing! I've never had ropa vieja so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was still delicious!! 

I slightly cooked my meat then tossed it in crock pot, in the same pan I sauteed the onion, green pepper, garlic then added the tomato sauce and sofrito until it boiled then I poured over the meat. I cooked on low for 10 hours. The only differece I made was thatI added 2 sazon packets, a sweet potato and a little extra adobe flavoring. 

I served with cilantro lime rice and black beans. A low maintenance winner in my book! I'd defintely make again.

This was great. I used stew meat and my slow cooker. First I browned the meat and put into cooker, then saut√©ed the onion and green pepper and put that with meat. Then did remaining ingredients, except for cilantro, and brought to boil and poured over meat. Cooked on high for 5 hours. I shredded the meat and added the cilantro and cooked for about 45 minutes on low. I made it with lime-cilantro rice and red beans. My husband was so impressed he did the dishes.

I LOVE this recipe.  Tastes just like Miami.  Serve it with black beans, plantains and hot Cuban bread (french bread if you have limited options).  Leftovers are great the next day too.  My family actually requests this meal when I make out a grocery list.  Good stuff!!!!!!

This was OK. It did lack flavor. Only ingredient I didn't use was the capers. I used a slow cooker. Came out real tender. Just add more seasoning. Otherwise good.

I made this in a slow cooker....YUM!  I seared the meat, put them in the slow cooker, then sauted the onion and pepper till soft, added the garlic for one minute, then the sofrito, tomatoes, water and the packets of sazon and boulion.  Let that mixture come to a boil, remove from heat and pour over meat in the slow cooker.  I put it on high for 6 hours and then my cooker switches it too low.  When I got home from work my family had already started picking at the meat!!!  I put the rice on, shredded the meat with tongs and a fork.  I did not add olives, capers or fresh cilantro at the end, my family is picky.  But they love this dish!  Will definitely make this again and again! Thank-you Goya!

I made this for the first time. I made it with a little over 2lb pot roast. Luke other reviews I didn't use all Goya products since I live down in south Texas and sometimes its hard to find some products. I had to make home made sofrito since I couldn't find it. I added extra garluc and sauted it with the onoins and bell peppers. I also added a whole bunch of cilantro since it does give it more flavor to the meal. My husband said it passed the test since he knows what this meal is suppose to taste like. It was a hit at my house, served it with white rice, black beans, and plantains.

Not bad but next time I'm leaving out the olives. My family aren't olives lovers so that underwhelmed them. Otherwise it's got lots of flavor, definitely making again.

I love this recipe because it gave me the courage to try a dish that I really wanted to make but was unsure of. I hate when people do this, but I did make some additions. I used double the meat because someone said it freezes well- so more pressure to turn out right! My biggest concern was getting enough flavor. I don‚Äôt like putting water on meat so I used beef broth instead of water and omitted the beef bullion. I also added 1 pack Lipton beefy onion mix just to make sure I fully subbed the bullion. I used red and orange peppers- didn‚Äôt have green. Didn‚Äôt use the olives (I‚Äôm sure it would have been better with them but didn‚Äôt have any). I added green chili sauce after all the other ingredients. Probably 2T. Same with apple cider vinegar. Cooked for about 3hours. I was shocked how tender it was! I‚Äôm really happy with the results. Can‚Äôt wait to do yellow plantain rice and beans with it.

Great taste and wonderful for potlucks/parties.  I've received many comments on it, and will have trouble ordering ropa vieja in restaurants as I believe this tastes better :)

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe as written only making two substitutions.  In place of the flank steak, I used skirt steak, and instead of the long grain rice noted in the recipe, I used Jasmine rice.  Oh, one more difference, I made  it in my Ninja Slow Cooker instead of on the stove.  It does require some prep time, but it was well worth it.

Amazing!  I read all the reviews and settled on olives with pimentos and capers already mixed from Goya.  I had to de pit all the olives but was well worth it.  The flavors mixed already.  I added the black beans and the plantains as suggested.  Plantains were nice with the sauce. I am Celiac so I had to make my own Sofrito but all was really good. LOVED that I could eat this stuff. So often, there's always some ingredient I can't eat so very glad to find a recipe I can eat too!

This was really good.  I followed directions to a T.  I think it really needs to olives/capers to better enhance the dishes flavor.  I gave it a 4 out of a 5 only because it was a tab bit to greasy in the pot.

I loved this recipe!!!!  It reminded me of the Cuban restaurant I went to in Miami.  I didn't put the olives or capers in the recipe, but followed everything else in it. I even used the leftovers for tacos a few days later, awesome.

This was amazing. I added a bit more garlic and some more seasoning because that is how we like it. Very good and the house smelled so good!

Made the recipe, expecting it to be full of flavor.  The end result was OK, but seemed lacking- not enough seasoning overall.  I did omit the olives, since I hate them, but I don't think they would have added much to the overall recipe.  Next time, I will try using more Adobo seasoning on the meat as well as adding the Sazon, bullion, and garlic to the meat.  Maybe browning the spices onto the meat will up the flavor intensity.  I would also recommend simmering a bit longer- my meat didn't shred easily even after the maximum time.

It came out great! It was easy to follow the recipe and you can adjust the seasoning to your own personal taste. I will definitely make this again. I served it over white rice and  a side of todtones and avocado.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it was wonderful. My husband and I both loved it. Kids weren‚Äôt home, but I know they will love it too. Hubs said he had never had a flank steak that was so tender. This will definitely be a regular on my table! I had a slightly smaller flank steak (1.5 pounds instead of 2.5) but I kept all of the other ingredient amounts the same except I used two cups of beef broth instead of three cups of water plus beef bouillon. Perfect!

Delicious!  Used all Goya ingredients except for sofrito.  I have my own home made sofrito in the freezer.  Also substituted 1 cup of water with Cabernet Sauvignon red wine.  Truly delicious!

I excluded the capers. I accidentally put in almost 1/4 c. of black pepper instead of 1/4 t. and shockingly it came out good, just a bit spicy. So with extra seasonings, (adobo, sazon, pepper) i would rate this 5 stars.
