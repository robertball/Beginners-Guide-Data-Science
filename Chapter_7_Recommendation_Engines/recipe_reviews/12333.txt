This recipe is delicious, but the raisins coupled with the brown sugar make it too sweet. I might try substituting some of the brown sugar for flour. The time and temperature also work with just one big tart (I think mine is 9 inches). I also didn't have any nutmeg, and cinnamon was an OK substitute.

I doubled the recipe, but added only 3/4 of a cup of raisons total, and also a good cup of chopped pecans, poured it into two 9" pie crusts, and baked for 15 minutes, cooled for one hour and they turned out great.  I didnt bake them as long as recipe called for as they would have come out burnt.  Taste tested on friend, and he survived with a smile!

This was my first attempt at butter tarts, they turned out great.  I cheated and used ready to bake pie crusts to fit in the muffin tins (not a very good crust maker.

These were easy to make, but I found they had too much lemon.  Otherwise, these are good.

I made my own crust and followed someone's suggestion to make one big tart.  It looks  a bit weird but tastes fine and setup well.

I love these as an alternative to pecan pie.  Easy to make and I prefer the bite size.

Well, I tried these tonight for the first time. My husband said no to the nutmeg. Personally, I would have left it in as I love the spice.
I only put one TBSP of lemon for the above recipe. I liked the butter tarts but my husband said they were too sweet.

These butter tarts are easy to make and taste delicious but only if you like the taste of minced meat.  I made some to bring to my grandchildren but didn't.
