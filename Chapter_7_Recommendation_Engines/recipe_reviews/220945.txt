Absolutely delicious! Wish I had doubled the recipe. Son would not eat the cranberries saying raisins would be better. Either way very tasty as the flavor of the custard is what makes the dish.

I made this kugel for Passover.  I made a double batch, and substituted golden raisins for the cranberries.  Everyone at the Seder table loved it.  There were no leftovers.
