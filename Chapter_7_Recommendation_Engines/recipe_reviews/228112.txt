The more natural/organic the ingredients are, the better I like them, and therefore I used fresh eggs to make the omelet.  This was a nourishing omelet that had wonderful flavor, perfect to start the day or for an easy, late night supper.

While this is not a particularly creative recipe, it's tasty and nutritious nonetheless. You leave the breakfast table knowing you did something good for yourself. Submitter directs to use egg substitute, but I couldn't go that far - I used four whole eggs. I was impressed that she called for just a small amount of olive oil, although I needed and used more like a tablespoon. And while the recipe calls for cheese, it's a reasonable amount, not gobs of it - on that I stuck to the recipe. I eliminated the red pepper flakes, giving this a few grinds of fresh ground pepper instead. All and all a great omelet - but one you will more than likely have to plan ahead for, unless you just happen to have all the ingredients at hand.

If you take out the cheeses and add nutritional yeast (tastes like cheese, not the same as bakers yeast), wrap it into a tortilla wrap and its a great breakfast.  I only use 1/4 of a cup of the egg substitute though and not salt since the yeast has a salty flavour.  I used only a 1/4 tsp of bacel instead of oil. Really good and very few calories.  Never tried it with the pepper flakes though.  Thats next.

This is really quite good. It's more of an omelet/fritatta hybrid than a true omelet, though, because the ingredients are incorporated in to the egg mixture. I had an 8 oz container of sliced mushrooms and a bag of wilting baby spinach that needed to be used. I also had all of the other ingredients on hand, so decided to try this for dinner. The thing is, I don't use egg substitute, so I just used real eggs. 4 large eggs can be used for the 8 oz of egg substitute listed in the recipe. Because I had so many mushrooms, though, I just doubled the recipe and cooked this is in an extra large skillet - that means for a standard 8 oz container of mushrooms you'll want to use 6-8 eggs. I used 6 because that's all I had left. Everything else was doubled, as written. It turned out quite nice. The pepper flakes gave it a nice little kick without being too spicy. Be sure you chop up the onions, mushrooms and spinach in to small, even pieces. Don't toss them in whole. This is a good, simple and FAST dish for any meal. I ate my portion with a little sour cream and additional shredded cheese. This would really work well if you've got little bits of other vegetables or even proteins like leftover chicken that need to be used up. If you're having trouble getting the top to finish cooking without burning the bottom, consider placing it in a pre-heated oven

I love spinach, mushrooms and onions in an omelet so I couldn't wait to try this. I, too, substituted farm fresh eggs for the egg substitute and used coconut oil in place of olive oil. I like my omelets to have filling so I added some of the veggie mixture and cheese to the eggs but left most of it out to put in the middle. I thought it could have used more cheese but I'm a cheese lover. The red pepper flakes didn't give it as much heat as I thought they would, which I'm glad of. Good, simple healthy omelet that was my dinner tonight :)

This ended as a very tasty  Omellete.  I only used half the salt and pepper, used extra Parmesan cheese and added a touch of crumbling goat cheese. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I added parsley flakes. Instead of cooking till firm, I pulled edges to the center and then flipped the  Omelette, turned off the heat and added 2 more tbl of Mozarella cheese. This was one of my best Omeletts ever!

Simple and delicious recipe for weekend brunch. My boys and husband loved it. I used organic eggs, Bella mushrooms, doubled the spinach serving and left out onions. I appreciate the fact that the omelette was not drowning in cheese. Will definitely make again.
