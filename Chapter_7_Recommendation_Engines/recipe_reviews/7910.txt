These were really good muffins! By the time they weredone baking though the streusel had melted all over the pan, but it was still good. I think I'll add some flour to it next time so it will keep it's shape. I also folded a mixture of 1/4c. brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon into the batter to add extra flavor which made it really good! thanks for the recipe!

I have made these a few times for church and they always turn out good. Make sure to press down the topping so it doesn't fall all over the pan.  Also, I do fold in 1/4 c. brown sugar and cinnamon into the batter as suggested by another cook.

I thought that this recipe would be great because of the star rating.  I found the muffins to be extrememly bland, the dough had a pizza dough consistency.  The topping burned.  Terrible!!!

I liked this recipe, they were very easy to make,I added some cinnamon and applesauce to the original recipe, and just for fun, swirled some marmelade through the muffin batter with a fork...Definately add some flour to the streusel topping and a bit of orange zest is nice too...!

Made this recipe for my kids and they loved the muffins. I took the suggestions from the other reviewers and added more cinnamon and a little more brown sugar to the batter and I think they came out perfect!

Tasted Pretty good but the topping even after adding flour to the mixture made a HUGE mess..I think i would wait 10 minutes into cooking time to add the topping next time.

I liked these cupcake.  I added some cinnamon, vanilla and sour cream to the batter and a little extra milk.  Muffins were very moist.  I had a problem with them sticking to the cupcake paper when the kids were eating them.  I will make these again.

really great recipe! i used only half of the amount because i only have a pan that holds six muffins. i also added a little vanilla extract. the topping melted into the muffin but it still tasted really great! my family liked it more than the usual crumbly streusel topping.. i added a little glaze on the top of mine by mixing confectioner's sugar + water. turned out really great and now they're almost gone. saving this recipe + will be making again in the future. thanks so much for sharing it with us!

Well, I played with it, adding about 1/3 c. flax seed, and the br. sugar and cinn to the batter as suggested, Im probably heavier on the cinnamon though.  I adjusted the milk and oil a bit to accomodate the extra dry ingredients.  Turned out great!

I agree with Corinna.. these muffins are blunt and have little flavor. They turned out looking delicious and I thought they would be great but the dough is not all that great.

I gave these a 3 because they are just ok. Not amazing, not terrible. I'd make them again but not with the topping. I would try the crumble topping that is used on apple pies instead.

I tried these muffins for unexpected guests and I thought they were excellent.  The only change I made was that I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  The next time I made these I substituted "light" ingredients.  They were still good but a little less rich than the orginial.  I'll make these over and over.

The topping melted all over the bottom of my oven. and the muffin had a hole in the middle, where the remaining topping sunk.  The muffin it self was very bland.

These things are great.  I have made them several times and they always go fast.  I made them without nuts though, because my family doesn't like them.  Very good and easy to make!

Very tasty, moist muffins, if you like more streusel (who doesn't?) then add make a double batch, use both coconut and nuts, and add 2 tsp. of flour. Very yummy.

Good recipe, but I made a few changes and want to offer a heads up.

Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar , 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and two tablespoons of milk to the batter, and added flour and just a little more butter  to the crumb mixture. I also used my hand to crumb up the crumb mixture instead of a fork (sooo much easier!). 
Heads up; it looks like too much crumb mixture, but it’s not. Load it up on all of the muffins, and be sure to lightly press it down onto the batter.

Here are great for days with ingredients you already have in your pantry. They rise up a lot, so full the cups halfway or 2/3.

These were ok, but I have to agree with others who said they were bland and tasted like dough.  The streusel topping made them edible, but otherwise, not very good.  I'm convinced many recipes on All Recipes are typed incorrectly.  This seemed to be missing something.  The topping needed flour to make it more crumbly.  I intended to add vanilla as others have suggested, but forgot.  I think that would have helped.

I had to add more milk to the batter because it was so thick. The streusel topping has too much butter in it and ran off of the muffins when they baked. I also found the muffin unflavorful. Won't make again.

I only used the recipe for the streusel topping from this recipe and put it on blueberry muffins.  It was very good!  It was a tad too sweet for my family.  Next time I will add less sugar.

Batter was way too dry - more like a bread dough consistency. Ended up increasing milk to 1 cup, adding 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter - but still found the batter to be a bit bland.

Baked for 12 minutes on the middle rack of my oven then took them out added the streusel topping and baked for another 5 minutes on the top rack. Still only turned out okay, wouldn't try again.

Yummy taste, but streusel was a MESS!  Tried pushing into batter, not filling cups too high etc, and still melted all over the side of the muffin pan (and not on the muffin!).  Also followed the suggesetion of other reviewers and added cinnamon and brown sugar to batter.  I also added a touch of vanilla.

I thought they were really dry. Not sure what I did wrong. Had them in the oven for about 20 mins.

This recipe is fantastic! Everything worked out very well for me; the muffins were moist and delicious with just enough cinnamon for my liking, and the streusel tasted delicious. I added some orange zest inside the batter and that was perfect for it. Next time I'm going to consider putting more zest or brown sugar inside the batter to give it a bit more flavour.

These were delicious. This recipe is very delicate and so universal. However if sticking with the streusal topping I would add a little more flavor to the batter. Add 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 c. brown sugar, 1 Tbsp pure vanilla. Depending on the thickness of the batter you may have to add more flour by the tsp. But if you are using this recipe to make blueberry or chocolate chip muffins add nothing expect those and omit the streusal topping. So very yummy! With some few alterations to make this my own I may use this recipe to make muffins for some muffin gift baskets. GREAT!

I added brown sugar and cinnamon to the batter and they turned out great.  I'll probably add the topping halfway through the baking time on my next attempt.

I give this 5 stars on ease and taste! A very good muffin with little mess. I also added a slice of apple on top before adding the streusel topping. Tasty! thanks for a great recipe!

Checked the muffins halfway through cooking, and used a table knife to scrape up topping and re-apply to the muffins.  Next time I will put cinnamon in the batter and follow the suggestion to press the topping into the batter more.  Overall, a delicious muffin, I will definitely make them again!

Too dry, not sweet enough.  I'm sure with some of the suggested modifications it'd be better, but as written it's not very good.

I liked them.  The streusel was great.  The muffin part, just okay.  I will add some vanilla next time, maybe some spices, to try to perk them up a bit.

I've added, such as advising other cooks, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a little milk. It was delicious!

Delicious muffins, but yes a bit on the bland side. Will definitely make again, with the additional 1/4 cup brown sugar, and cinnamon in the batter.

My husband loved these muffins, and he really isn't a muffin kind of guy. I made them in the very large muffin tins so I needed to add an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time. I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter.

This was good, but if I were to make it again I would add the extra 1/4 cup brown sugar to the dough like others have mentioned.

I compared the sugar content to other similar muffins, and it seemed short--so I added a full cup and they were quite good.

these muffins are pretty good - i made a few changes. i added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter to make it a little sweeter, which was perfect. the muffin itself is almost bread-like and not moist like most muffins. next time i will probably up the oil a bit to make the batter less of a dough consistency and more like a batter. i didn't have any problems with the topping melting or whatever, but next time i will definitely double it... i don't use nuts or coconut. in general, i'll make these again for sure, just a little tweaking.

I used only the strusel topping part of this recipe for some muffins I made.  I wasn't really in love with it.  When you bit into the muffin it would all fall off.  It got crispy instead of crumbly.  I would probably use another topping if I want a strusel topping on my muffins.
