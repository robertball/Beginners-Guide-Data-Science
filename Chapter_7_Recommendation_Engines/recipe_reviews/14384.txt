Compared to all other blue cheese dressing I've made or tried, I was very disappointed in this dressing.  I was looking for authentic, steak-house-style, thick blue cheese dressing.  The tablespoon of pepper sauce in this watery concoction really drowned out the flavor that you want to taste... the blue cheese.

This is a very tasty dressing.  We tried it on not only a chef salad but Buffalo Wings, as well.  The family loved it!

While better than some homemade dressings, this is really unimpressive. Increasing the blue cheese didn't help either. Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

I absolutely love this recipe! I also doubled the blue cheese, and I used gorgonzola from Italy. I love the spicy taste - never would have thought of adding the hot sauce myself. Thanks a bunch, Linda!

Terrific!  I used light mayo and reduced-fat sour cream and still got great results.  I'm a blue cheese fanatic, so I doubled the amount of blue cheese.

This was a really awesome blue cheese dressing.  I've never made salad dressing before (except for premixed seasoning packets), and the idea of making my own blue cheese dressing instead of buying it at the store kind of amused me.  But it sounded so easy, I went for it, and am so glad that I did!  It is MUCH better than any store bought dressing I've ever tried.  I also spent the money to get a good quality blue cheese, and think that was worth it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I was after a Blue Cheese Sauce for some Buffalo Chicken Wings.  This recipe appealed to me for its combination of mayonnaise, sour cream and buttermilk.  I eased up on the buttermilk only because I wanted a thicker dipping sauce for the wings. What's left I'll thin out with more buttermilk for salad dressing.  I eased up on the Worcestershire, using only half the amount called for, and chose fresh parsley and garlic over the dried parsley and garlic powder, tho' I don't think it's a big deal one way or the other.  Bottom line is, I loved this stuff.  (No comment from Hubs who'd rather have a root canal than eat Blue cheese)

My husband is a blue cheese fanatic, and he loves this recipe.  I doubled the blue cheese and also added more parmesan than what is called for in the recipe- probably 3 times as much.

Ok flavor I doctored it up after following to a tee. Oh what kind of hot sauce would be helpful. I used Franks red hot.
Very runny I would reduce the buttermilk

I have been looking for a blue cheese dressing that tasted like what is served at Champps Restaurant and this is SOOOO close. This is easy to make and is delicious! One warning though ... it's addictive!

I wasn't crazy about this.  It is certainly better than storebought (hooray for no chemicals) but as a blue cheese salad dressing, this wasn't the taste I was looking for.  I think it would probably be a great dip though, with the spicy-ish additions.  Just not what we wanted for topping lettuce.

Good flavor but way too RUNNY! Maybe cut the buttermilk down to 1/2 cup or less?

I used this dressing to make Buffalo Chicken Paninis.  I realized I was out of worcestershire sauce so substituted red wine vinegar and a dash of fish sauce.  It was delicious and thickened up nicely after sitting for a while in the refrigerator.  I cut the recipe down to 1/4 and will keep a batch of this in the refrigerator from now on.

Wonderful! I did sub non fat yogurt for the buttermilk to cut calories and make a little thicker dressing.  Enjoyed this over our BLT wedge salads.  Thanks Linda!

I made as directed and it was good.  Based upon my personal preferences, I will probably reduce the "red pepper sauce" (I used tabasco) as it just didn't seem to fit.  Maybe the poster meant some sort of Louisiana style sauce?  Other thoughts are to reduce mayo and increase sour cream.  But overall, good as written.

This recipe gives the best combination of ingredients. I was attracted to it because it includes buttermilk and sour cream. I made just as the recipe was written. What a hit with our fresh salad last night. Everyone enjoyed it! Next time I may use fresh parsley and garlic (instead of the garlic powder). You can always make it lower calorie by using light sour cream and mayonnaise. But this is now MY Blue Cheese Dressing recipe. No need to look any further!

I had some blue cheese that needed using up so I picked this recipe to try out.  I left out the parm thinking the blue cheese I had was a bit strong and didn't need it.  Also left out the parsley mainly because I've never seen it in any commercial Blue Cheese Dressing I've ever purchased.  I also cut back just a little on the hot pepper sauce as suggested by other reviewers especially since I was having Buffalo Wings.  The finished dressing was creamy and delicious!  It went great with the  Buffalo Wings and was even better the next day on a green dinner salad once the ingredients melded a bit more.  4 stars because of the omissions but definitely 5 star flavor!  Great recipe!

Yummy and so easy! Used low fat sour cream, low fat mayo made with olive oil, and loved the tangyness of the buttermilk. I did half the recipe...makes a lot. I did omit the parm and parsely and added fresh cracked pepper. Served with Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches from this site. Thanks!

Many years ago I had a similar recipe but instead of the hot sauce that recipe called for horseradish.  It was wonderful and I suggest it be substituted for the hot sauce in Linda's recipe.

This is a solid recipe.  I forget to get buttermilk so I just used the nonfat milk that I had and it was still very good.

Good, but did need some doctoring.  I used 1/2 cup buttermilk to make it thicker and more parmesan cheese.  I used fresh Italian parsley instead of dried.  I added salt and pepper.  Now I like it!

I liked this recipe because it wasn;t all mayonnaise.  I love the extra flavor that buttermilk adds to the dressing.   I added some white pepper, lemon juice and mustard because I like a little more spice to my blue cheese.  I was great with chicken wings and is now my favorite blue cheese dressing.

I made this recipe exact as written. Comments said to thin  to much hot sauce. I did not find this with mine the Franks hot sauce I used May have given a pink tinge but if it did it was worth it. It was thick and seems to have enough blue cheese for me,and I love blue cheese. If anything I may add a touch of white pepper   Good job Linda so much better than boughten dressings
