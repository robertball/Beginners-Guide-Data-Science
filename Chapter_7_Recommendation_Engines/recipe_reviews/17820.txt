I altered this recipe by mixing in dried cranberries and nuts in with the batter. Instead of shortening, I used applesauce to make these muffins a little more healthier (i'm all about that). Also, I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of a whole cup of all purpose flour. As suggested by other users, I decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp and added a tsp of vanilla. Also, I sprinkled some oats and cinnamon sugar on the tops of the muffins while they were baking to give them a little extra flavor and look. In the end, these bran muffins came out delicious and full of flavor!

Five star because husband LOVED them. I wasn't too thrilled. It was very salty, next time I might cut the salt in 1/2. For those who don't want whole flakes in their muffins try soaking the flakes in the milk mixture for 10-15 minutes. I did that and there was no sign of the flakes

Not fond of raisins so I used just plain bran flakes.  They turned out great.  The family loved them but my husband requested that I crush the flakes first.  He didn't really like finding whole flakes in his muffins.  This is my new recipe for breakfast muffins.  Thanks.

Nice and moist, but not very sweet.  I think they were a bit too salty, too.

This recipe is super easy, and really good.
I was surprise at how moist my muffins turned out.
I substituted apple sauce for the oil to make them
even healthier.  Still just as great!

Best at 375 for 14 Min. Great light 8 muffins. Used 1/2 AP Four and 1/2 wheat. Will probably add the banana others suggested next time.

I had some ginger cereal flakes with raspberries that I used instead of bran flakes. Very tasty! Quite a hit with our Russian exchange student.

These are very good and easy to make. My BF requests a batch of these almost every week. Have replaced honey for the sugar a few times and use Raisin Bran Crunch instead of regular Raisin Bran. Doubling the recipe makes 12 good size muffins. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe to use up some Raisin Bran Extra (with dried cranberries and yogurt clusters) because none of the kids would eat it ... They ate more than half the muffins fresh out of the oven before dinner.  I did substitute chunky applesauce for the shortening.  These muffins are moist and delicious.

After reading the reviews which were VERY helpful,  I changed this recipe-- COMPLETELY.  I upped the bran cereal and milk, used buttermilk powder, added orange extract,dried cranberries and walnuts for flavor- substituted applesauce and honey to increase the moisture and sprinkled with brown sugar.  I also decreased the salt and baking times.  I think I created my own recipe-- If you would like to try these yummy muffins-  I submitted them under the name--- Coffee House bran muffins.

These muffins are soo yummy! I made them because my daughter has tummy troubles and needed extra fiber in her diet so I thought these would be good for her. They were so delicious I had to make a second batch the day after I made them because the whole family loved them. I altered a few things to better suit my family's needs... First I swapped out the sugar for brown sugar, I added a cap of vanilla but I did double the recipe so half a cap should do if you follow the recipe. I also added about 1/2-3/4 cup of homemade apple sauce. I also made them mini muffins so I only baked for 16-20 min. We loved them like this but the next batch I used half white flour and half whole wheat, I didn't even notice the difference. I would recommend these over and over. They are great as a quick breakfast, snack in a school lunch, or before bed snack. soo yummy! thanks for adding the recipe :)

I made these twice.  The first time I used butter and whole wheat flour.  They were OK but very greasy and salty.  The next day I made a batch with applesauce instead of the shortening, whole wheat flour, half a cup of frozen wild blueberries and half the salt.  (Both times I used skim milk with no problem.)  PERFECTO!  The next time I am going to sprinke some sanding sugar on top for a little sweetness, as they are only mildly sweet.  Oh, I only got ten muffins with both batches.  I also recommend no liners; they will stick.  I love these; a perfect quick breakfast.

I love this recipe just of the simplicity factor.  I have made it only a few times and almost have it memorized.  I also let it sit for just a bit to let the flakes soften up and I use whole wheat flour and substitute apple sauce for the shortening.  I also have cut back on the sugar a little.  I have added fresh blueberries, cranberries and more raisins.  We like ours loaded with yummy stuff.  I have added a bit more apple sauce until the consistency is right otherwise it was a bit dry.  It is a great recipe for people who like to "Tweak" recipes to their likening.  I did try and use paper cups and that was a disaster.  Almost all of the muffin stuff to the cup.  I am going to try and freeze them to see how well they hold up so I can take some camping too.

I've made these several times, and each time they've been excellent! The whole family loves these, and they're healthy to boot. I like to use butter for the shortening, and add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for a little extra flavor.

These muffins were really good. My husband loved them and didn't even know they were "healthy". I made a few changes: I used honey bunches of oats instead of raisin bran and applesauce instead of the shortening. They turned out very moist and sweet. They only took about 15 minutes to bake.

These came out good, but I changed/added several things: 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 all-purpose flour, used oil instead of shortening, added more raisins, added chopped pecans, and added cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Also, it made 9 regular-sized muffins, not 12. Only cooked them for 20 minutes. Would make them again (with the changes...)

If you are looking for a muffin that tastes like a cupcake forget it. If you want a muffin for the times when a bowl of cereal is impractical, this is it.This is a plain, not very sweet muffin. I used honey instead of sugar, applesauce instead of oil. I whipped the egg white seperately & folded that in. I also added cinnamon & left out the salt. I got 12 regular sized muffins, no problem.

Little dry and cook way faster than the recipe says. Also, if I make them again I'll omit the salt or at least cut it in half. They are convenient at I usually have all the ingredients on hand and I can make a small batch. Worth tinkering with a little to see if I can increase their moistness.

These were yummy, moist muffins. I used margarine instead of shortening, whole wheat flour, added no salt at all, and put in walnuts, and they tasted great. In my oven they only took 8 min, so watch them carefully!

I read other reviews first and followed suit, using half the salt and halving the baking time. I used plain bran flakes because I'm not a big fan of raisins. I also crushed the flakes, added 1/2 cup of blueberries, 2 Tbsp. of honey, and about 1/4 cup more milk [I think this was due to letting the cereal sit for so long to soak up the milk], topped them with some oats and they were absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and kids loved them.. very moist. This one's a keeper!

I've made these many times over the years. I use buttermilk, butter, whole wheat flour and one chopped banana. I also add one tsp. of vanilla extract. These keep well.

A nice, quick recipe for Bran Muffins that really don't taste like Bran Muffins! Very pleasant tasting. As I didn't have shortening, I substituted butter. The only change I would make would be to shorten the cooking time -- I was not careful enough, and after 26 minutes, the bottoms of a few of them were a little dark.

I omitted the refined sugar and replaced with same measurement of honey. These came out great - not too sweet and full of fiber!

These turned out great! I didn't change much, I used less salt, turned the temp. down to 375 and cook time to 20 min. They are perfect...topped with butter while they're still hot, mmm. I did crush the cereal and then measured it so they were more dense, but still light and fluffy. A great way to use up that leftover cereal.

YUMMY and very quick.  I used the suggestions below...took out the salt, used applesauce instead of oil, used half organic wheat and half organic white flour.  Added a few spices and a 1/4 of chopped dates.  They came out fabulous.  I will keep this one in my recipe box.  YUMMY THANKS

I think these muffins would be great if they were properly sized.  The recipe says 8 servings.  But, the recipe itself says to grease 12 muffin cups and so I made 12 muffins and there was not enough batter for them.  I baked them 20 minutes instead of 30 because of their size.  Since there were no spices in the recipe, I added 1/2 teaspoon cinamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  I would suggest reducing the salt as well and possibly using oil rather than shortening.  I would add 1/4 cup of raisins since I don't think there were enough in the original recipe.

Not the absolute best muffin I've added, but very tasty and moist as well. My two year old son loved them. I never used the salt and they turned out fine. I also substituted the sugar with half cup of black-strap molasses. Since Raisin Bran doesn't have enough raisins when only using one cup, I recommend adding other chopped fruit.

These were not too bad. Could be a little sweeter though maybe double the sugar or add some cinnamon or something. I thought the 400* was right on but only baked for about 23 minutes. Be sure to beat the shortening well or you will end up with greasy clumps!

Easy & good.  I added one mashed banana and reduced milk to 1/2c, used plain bran flakes, and added a dash vanilla ext.  Also used olive oil instead of shortening.  Kids loved them & will make again.

I followed the instructions exactly. I went in to check on the muffins after about 22 minutes and they were already burnt. I pulled one out to taste, and they were mostly flavorless except for the salt. Waaaaayy to much salt. I will not make again.

My kids really enjoyed these muffins. They aren't very sweet so I didn't mind giving them 2nds and 3rds. The only problem was my first batch almost burned. After only 20 minutes they were darker than I like. But by adjusting the oven to 375 and the timer to 18 min we had perfect muffins.

I did not find this recipe too salty.  It was just too boring.  Way too bland.  Plus the cooking time is way off.  Done in 20 minutes.  I have a brand-new oven which heats perfectly, so I know it isn't my oven.  I'll be searching for another recipe.

i make a few simple changes to really make these a family fav.  as others have mentioned, i double the recipe.  for the shortening, i use one mashed banana plus 1/4 liquid crisco.  for the flour, i use 1c. white flour, plus 1c. whole wheat flour.  i also add 1/4c bran buds and 3tbsp ground flax to the bran flakes mixture.  i use only 1/4 c. sugar for the doubled recipe.  my kids, gobble these up, without knowing how healthy they are!

Thanks you!  I had some special K with strawberries that I was getting a bit tired of.  I used this recipe with some changes others recommended, 1/2 the salt, added cinammon, added raisins.  They are delicious.  If you like a really sweet muffin this is not it.  I do not, and this was perfect for me.  I put cream cheese frosting on for my husband and for someone who doesn't like muffins....he asked for another one!

I love bran muffins, and Raisin Bran cereal so this seemed like a no fail combo. I just tasted one of these hot out of the oven are they were pretty good for how easy they were to make. Though I did doctor them up: I used 3/4 whole wheat flour and 1/4 all purpose flour, 1 prepacked cup of applesauce, and I threw in some flax seed and whole wheat germ for added nutrition. I am sure with jam these will be a great treat.

The taste of the muffin was very good. I gave it 4 stars and not five becuase they came out a little "tough". I am not sure if it was me or the recipe. Also, it made 6 muffins fit for an adult not 12 tiny baby muffins.

Pretty good - nothing real exciting.  But, I was just looking for a bran muffin recipe.  I did shorten the cooking time to 20 minutes.  I used buttermilk instead of milk and oil instead of shortening.  I crushed the flakes, added less salt, and added extra raisins.  And cinnamon.  Next time I would add a little more sugar and a little more cinnamon.

The recipe is wrong!  There's so much baking powder that the baking powder and salty flavor overwhelms the recipe. And what other's have said on the time in the oven is right. I took them out after 17 minutes and they were perfectly baked - just inedible flavor wise!

A simply good muffin. I used butter, which I melted, in place of shortening and  plain store brand flakes (in a muffin you can't tell a difference!). I tossed in a handful of raisins too.  These muffins are on the smallish side and took less then 20min @375.

Whatever I had in the pantry I added and realised too late that I'd no muffin tins, so just dumped batter in a bread pan. It's the softest, moistest, most flavourful banana muffin muffin bread I've ever made. Flew off the counter.

I thought these were terribly dry. They cooked in half the time on the recipe and were still overdone. Also they made only nine SMALL MUFFINS. WOULD NOT make again unless I could adapt the recipe. Husband said he liked but I found inedible.

Made a few changes.  Used half white flour and half white whole wheat.  Always try to do this when I bake.  Used brown sugar.  Used melted salted butter instead of shortening and didn't add extra salt.  Didn't have bran flakes with raisins so I added some but did what I do to all raisins I add to muffins, I put in saucepan covered with whiskey and heated to just a simmer.  Drain and add raisins to batter.  The added moisture in the raisins makes the muffins moister longer and the alcohol bakes away.  Took out after 20 minutes, 30 minutes way too long.

An easy and deliciously simple recipe. I did add additional raisins to be sure there would be a raisin in every bite, and because the batter is so pale, I crushed additional dry cereal flakes and sprinkled the tops before baking. It added a little crunchy texture, as well as, a pretty "bakery" look. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I added more raisins and used brown sugar and cinnamon so they tasted all right.  Still have more cereal to use up, so I'm going to cut the salt in half, and dice up some apple and maybe a few dates.
The baking time is too long; they were burnt - 18-20 minutes at 375 would have worked.  Also, I got only 9 small muffins...

I altered this recipe to my liking by using Kashi brand Sprouted grain cereal and Sweet potato sunshine cereal, crushed in place of Bran flakes, golden raisins , organic (expeller pressed) coconut oil , a little cinnamon, 1/2 cup sugar and about 2 tablespoons of dehydrated buttermilk. I let the batter rest for some time to fluff/ soften the crushed flakes.They came out DELISH! I wish I had some brown sugar in the cabinet, because I would have used that! I HIGHLY recommend trying these cereals for baking !! YUM! I baked them for about 17 minutes in a preheated oven.

Good despite the fact that I used all bran flakes and forgot to add raisins. Husband ate three right away. Would make again also just because of the easiness factor.

Very easy and quick to make.  I omitted the salt, used margarine because had no shortening and made mini muffins.  Baked for 15 mins. and they turned out perfect!

I didn't like the idea of using shortening or oil so I changed this part to include 1/4 cup milled flax seed and 1/4 cup of cranberry juice. Any juice would have been fine, but cranberry pomegranate was all I had on hand. I also changed the flour to 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour to make it all more heart healthy. I put in some nuts and 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. It came out very nicely. Just the size to put in those silicon muffin cups in a countertop convection oven to cook in only one batch. Silicon muffin cups make everything great! Thanks for the base recipe.

Once my kids eat all the raisins out of the Raisin Bran cereal, there is always some bran cereal around. So to get rid of it I tried this recipe and added raisins (1/2 cup) back in. I doubled the recipe to make 18 muffins. Following other suggestions I swapped the oil for shortening and reduced the salt by half. And as also noted, the cooking time should only be about 20 minutes. I added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and also sprinkled the top with some cinnamon sugar. These are not as bran as most bran muffins. A little on the bland side even with cinnamon and definitely not sweet enough.

DELICIOSO! I actually put in an overripe bananna and an apple in it and skipped the salt. Also, I used 50% more of the bran flakes, flour, milk for a standard 12 muffin pan. This was soo easy and I don't bake. Highhly recment the apple and banana.

If ever a recipe needed tweaking it's this one.  I made them because I needed a recipe with milk instead of buttermilk.  My muffins developed a tough crust and were very small.  I got only 9 from a recipe that said it yielded 12.  The flavor was very good and I will make them again, but bake them at a lower temperature.  I will also use whole bran cereal and add more raisins or dried cranberries.

Yum! Very nice for a simple muffin!  I think 30 min. is too long though. I only put the muffins in for 15 minutes and they came out perfectly. I also took Patty's suggestion and added oats and cinnamon on the top before putting them in the oven. Very nice touch!

Mine turned out very short, and still only got 11 out of the mix. I should have just tried for 9 or 10. I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a few dashes of ground cloves and nutmeg, and used only 1/4 tsp of salt based on other reviews. Overall they are good though probably could even still be sweeter.

did this recipe twice.  the first time i followed it almost to a T (changes: halfed the salt & added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon).  had a friend take them to local heroes he decribed them as dry :(  second time i used veg oil instead of shortening and allowed them to rest overnight.  oops, also aded 1/4 c chocolate chips and 1/4 c of rehydrated craisins.  still quite dry.  maybe more milk?

I really like this recipe.  Except for using soy milk, I followed the recipe and although they were a little small, they taste great even tho there is only a scant 1/4 c. of sugar in them .  I was looking for more recipes that use less sugar and this one is that meets that criteria.

Substituted brown sugar for the white and increased it to 1/3 C.  Also baked for about 15 minutes.  30 minutes would have resulted in a pretty dry muffin.

i doubled the recipe and used a can of sweetened (low fat) condensed milk in place of regular milk and added no sugar--used pumpkin puree instead of oil and used all whole wheat flour--had a half can of peaches to use up so chopped those small and added--turned out great!  loved them

Makes for a great base recipe for muffins using cereal. I doubled the recipe. I did use less salt, added cicnnamon and allspice, used cactus honey powder instead of sugar, used mashed overripe banana and a splash of oil instead of shortening, and used half unbleached white and half wheat flour. Oh and I used some raisin bran and some all bran and added chopped dates. I baked at 375 for 18min. lol, like I said great base recipe.

These were very good, not overly sweet, but sweet enough.  Not what I'd call 'healthy' because of the oil/shortning and sugar, but a nice treat.  My toddler is eating it as we speak, which is why I've given it 5 stars!  Like other reviewers, I found the time given WAY to long.  I cooked mine at moderate, for 15 minutes in my fan-forced oven and that was perfect.  Also, I didn't grease my non-stick oven tray, and they came out cleanly.  Will be making this again.

These muffins were ok but not great.  I love using the bran flakes cereal, but I think they need a bit more flavor.  I'm going to try them again with maple syrup instead of sugar.

I haven't tasted these yet, but for ease of prep and the way they smell they get 4 stars.  I did double the recipe thinking I would get 24 muffins to take some to my neighbors, but I only got 12 good sized muffins, so next time I will triple the recipe and fill the muffin cup just a little less.  I also think I might add a pinch of cinnamon and maybe some chopped walnuts.

Good muffins. Instead of Raisin Bran I used a Fruit and Grain cereal which gave it some nice additional fruit and nut flavors. I also used vegetable oil instead of shortening, increased the sugar slightly and added some cinnamon for more flavor. I doubled the recipe and it made 11 large muffins. They freeze real well. I take one out of the freezer for breakfast.

These muffins were light and fluffy, and not too sweet.  I substituted honey for the sugar to make them a bit healthier.  Not your typical heavy bran muffin, though I may try it with part whole wheat flour next time.

Very good! Not as bran-y as your typical raisin bran muffins. (Or as my brother put it, "these don't taste like health food.") Quick and easy to prepare, too. However I only got nine relatively small muffins out of this amount of batter, I would double the ingredients when making it again.
