This was a VERY easy, FAST and delicious recipe! I added 2 tsp vanilla and since I did not have self-rising flour, used 1 cup flour plus 1 tsp baking powder. Also, I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the peaches and their juice. Baked it at 350 for 1 hour uncovered and it browned nicely. If you are looking for a crispy topping, this will not be the recipe for you, rather the cobbler reminded me of a warm and gooey pie inside! It was excellent with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream and/or whipped  cream! So easy to prepare and of course- to eat! Thanks for the recipe - this will be a repeat recipe for our family. Thank you for sharing!

This was pretty good. Let me share with you my favorite peach cobbler recipe so far this summer: melt one stick of butter in an 8 x 8 pan, mix 1 tsp of lemon juice with 1 cup of sugar and about 4 cups of peeled, pitted sliced peaches (5 peaches) together; put this mixture on top of melted butter. Sprinkle cinnamon to suit your taste over top. Then mix together 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of milk. Place this topping all over the top of the peaches. Do not stir. Let bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes. Enjoy!

This is just like my granny's .. I love it. I use the same ingredients just put them together like my grandmother does. She melts the butter into the bottom of her pan, pour peaches over the top and then mixes together the milk, flour & sugar. Then pours the milk mixtures right in the center of the peaches. By then end of baking the milk mixture rises to the top and makes an awesome topping.

I didn't have self rising flour, so I used (according to a "substitutions" website I found) 1 cup of flour (minus 2 tsp), 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder for every cup of self rising flour. I doubled the recipe, and used 2-28 ounce cans of peaches (I like lots) but only the juice/syrup from one and cooked in a 9x13 pan until golden brown on top. LOVED IT!!!!!! Thanks so much! (served with whipped cream while still hot!)

YUMMY!!! So, so easy! The crust came out a beautiful golden brown. I did make slight adjustments, though. I used the 29 ounce can of peaches instead of the smaller can (the 15 ounce can just wouldn't be near enough fruit for me!). I used about half of the juice. I also added 1 tsp vanilla flavoring, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. And, like some of the other users, I had to eventually up the temperature to 400 degrees and cook a few more minutes. Next time, I think I'll try 1/8 tsp nutmeg and use just a little more juice from the can. Serve this up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! A very tasty dessert!

Sorry, I didn't much care for this recipe. I had to bake it much longer to get it to brown - actually, I had to bump the oven to 400. It didn't have a lot of flavor - I would suggest adding vanilla and cinnamon (I should have read the other reviews first).

I've been making this recipe for years; however, my recipe calls for only half the butter and filling ingredients with only one 15 1/4 oz can of peaches in syrup. Perhaps that's why this recipe took so long to cook and it was less flavorful ~ too much dough. Excess dough also caused the recommended pan size to be inadequate.

This was great!! It did take an hour to bake as the other reviews said, I also spooned the peaches on rather than poured, and I sprinkled over a bit of cinnamon.  It was much nicer than I expected, and I will definitely be making this again. Yum!

This recipe reminds me of my Aunts.  It's sooo good, I can't make enough to keep in the house for guests.  I didn't have self-rising flour on hand so I added 1 tsp. baking powder, and like the rest, what is a peach cobbler without cinnamon. It's like apple pie without apples. lol

I decided to make this because of KALDIRRIS' review yesterday. Normally, an awful review will make me bypass a recipe, but in this particular case, the review was so absolutely unecessarily RUDE that honestly I was shocked and refused to believe that a recipe with a 4 star average with >150 reviewerscould be that bad. I'm not a peach fan, but hubby is so I made this for him. His rating is "a solid four stars."  My only alteration was to use frozen peaches that I nuked in the microwave to thaw and get juicy. It also took closer to 35 minutes in my oven.  THANK YOU for sharing your recipe with us, and I'm so sorry that another reviewer was so unnecessarily cruel.

This was a very easy recipe, but I think either you love it or you hate it. I made it for a pot luck and nobody touched it except 3 people. One person only liked the "bread" part and the other 2 thought it was soooo good they ate it all by themself.  I did try a piece and I thought it was good, it just didn't "look" good.

The way we do this recipe down south is to put a stick of butter in a baking dish (corning) melt it in a 350 degree oven.  Mix the s.r. flour and sugar add milk.  Take the dish out of the oven and pour in the mixture and then add the peaches but don't stir it!! Bake until  nice and bubbley and brown.  Enjoy!

This cobbler could not have been easier to make, taking less than 5 minutes to get into the oven. So, the "easy" part is spot on. I prefer more fruit so I opened a 29 oz can of peaches and used all of the fruit and only 1/2 of the juice. This worked out perfect for our taste. We also like cinnamon in peach desserts, so just a small amout was sprinkled on top before baking. I checked the cobbler after 25 minutes and in my oven, it required a litttle more time (approx. 10 additional minutes.) This turned out to be a great recipe. I didn't experience any "doughy" problems. The sweetness level was perfect and the slightly gooey (like pie filling) inside is delicious. I would be happy to make & serve this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was very easy to make and very good! I added 2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of cinnamon and also used 1 tsp of baking powder because I didnt have self rising flour. I also only used half of the juice from the peaches because i dont like it real mushy. It turned out great, my hubby loved it and I will definatly be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Here's the thing - my husband, a good ole' Georgia boy, LOVED this cobbler, BUT if I hadn't made the changes that I did he would have been really unimpressed.   I doubled the quantity of peaches (used a 29 oz. can) and cooked them down with 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon in a saucepan over medium high heat for a few minutes.  This thickens up the sauce and distributes the vanilla/cinnamon nicely.  Then I poured it over the crust mixture in a lightly greased 8x8 pan, sprinkled it with sugar and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes.  It came out beautifully brown and perfectly baked with a lovely proportion of peaches to crust.    So as a basis this recipe was terrific, but since it did need some adjustments I only gave it 3 stars.

Added vanillla and cinnamon to the recipe, otherwise i kept it exactly as it is written. The time was off because i doubled the recipe (cooked 1 hour instead of the 30 minutes stated) I also turned the oven up to 400 for the last 5 minutes of cooking to help brown it. It turned out wonderfully! Thanks for sharing!

I made this as a quick dessert for my three boys with a healthier twist. I used half the amount of sugar called for in the "dough", half whole wheat/half white flour and lowfat buttermilk. I had some frozen freestone peaches I thawed especially for this recipe and I faked the canned "juice" by adding just a touch of cornstarch dissolved about a half cup of water, one tablespoon of lemon juice and a quarter cup of honey. I just cooked it in a small saucepan until it thickened up.  I took a couple other reviewer's advice and added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little vanilla. All three my boys enjoyed this and "yummed" all the way through it. I thought it looked lovely, just like something that my Grandma made for us kids when we were little. Quick dessert and it was completely inhaled. No "icks" at my table!

Last fall, I home-canned some fresh spiced peaches (recipe in the Ball Blue Book), and now nine months later I popped open a jar to make this recipe and WOW! It makes such a wonderful difference!!! Honestly, I was reminded of sitting in my great-grandmother's NC kitchen in the middle of summer, it's that homemade good. 
The only reason I gave this a 4-star rating is because it is more "soupy" than I expected, and next time I will cut the amount of milk in it. But, I can't say I didn't go back for seconds :)

(Word to the wise: Use cooking spray on all sides of the baking dish, & mix the batter in a bowl rather than directly in the dish; pour the batter into the dish then top w/ the peaches - otherwise, you'll never get the caramelized sugar off the sides.)

This is a great recipe!! I tried this last night and it was a hit. My hubby even said it was good and he doesnt like peaches. The only changes I made was I added 1 tsp vanilla to the batter with a couple shakes of cinnamon and a shake of nutmeg. I reduced the sugar for the batter to 3/4 cup. I put the butter in the bottom of the pan instead of in the batter. I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the peaches and juice and let simmer on stovetop for about 15 minutes. I poured the peaches in the pan on top of the butter and then added the batter and baked until it was nice and brown on top. I used two 8 in cake pans to bake in. I had my batter in one measuring bowl and my peach mix in another. I poured half of each in each pan and set them on cookie sheets in the oven. There was very little spill over. We ate a whole one with icecream and i wrapped the other one up with foil after it cooled and froze it. I will make this again since it was good and very easy to make. I will try different fruit or combinations of fruit next time. Thanks for this recipe.

Seriously easy and fantastic tasting!  We let it cook about an extra five minutes to get the "crust" to be golden.  It's like eating a pie filling cobbler with ice cream.  We recently made a far more complicated recipe out of a local cookbook and it was terrible!  This one was MUCH better and so much easier!

Delicious and not too sweet. I used Splenda blend for baking, and served with no-sugar-added vanilla ice cream. Baked it in 2-8x8" pans, took one to work--not a crumb left!

What can I say? We ate the entire batch (just the two of us) and we don't even like canned peaches that much! Easy, quick, cheap and delicious: this is a definite keeper! Next time, I might reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup but it's already awesome as is. Oh and if you're looking for a cake-like cobbler, this one is not for you... This one is gooey and creamy, more flan-like.

It did not turn out very well. It did not have the right texture or flavor. If I may recommend an equally easy but rather tasty recipe, see Peach cobbler VI. You'll see the difference.

I incorporated suggestions from others and melted my butter in 10 x 10" corningware dish.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to 29 oz. can of peaches and simmered it for about 15 minutes.  Added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla to batter.  I sprayed the sides of the dish with butter flavored spray and poured the batter into the melted butter.  Spooned on the peaches and all juice.  After cooking about 10-15 min. I sprinkled the top with sugar and continued baking.  Was done and golden brown in 30-35 min.  I've made it a couple of times now and it is delicious even without ice cream.  Gave it 4 stars but with additions it's definately a 5 star and just as good if not better the next day!

This recipe takes FOREVER to actually bake and become firm.  It had to stay in the oven for well over an hour.  I don't know what the problem was because I followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted fine once I took it out of the oven,  thought it is a bit bland.  I even gave up and just took it out even though it was not totally firm, but everything was done.  I would NOT recommend this recipe because it takes so long and the taste is not worth the effort.

This is not your typical cobbler, but it is the one I grew up on. My family's recipe, and the 1st thing I ever learned to bake. I LOVE this cobbler. So glad I found it here as I had lost my mother's recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised with this cobbler.  I used frozen peaches defrosted and substituted 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt to rise flour. I liked how the peaches dropped to the middle of the cobbler, leaving a nice bottom and top layer of crust.  Very simple but very tasty.  Definately for those who like a little cobbler with their peaches..

This recipe turned out great!  The only adjustment I made was that I added a light sprinkling of sugar on top, which made the topping get nice and crunchy.

I have used this for two years and each time I add something a little different to it.  Actually tastes awesome  with a few tweaks.  I double the butter, I use two cans of peaches, and I add nutmeg and cinnamon to give a more authentic southern flavor.  Do a Mixture of Canned peaches, and use the canned peaches packed in water not syrup. Also, just use a portion of the liquid, I do not feel it needs a full can's worth of syrup.  Serve hot with vanilla ice cream...popular every time!  :)

This is the way my mom made peach cobbler and it is a comfort food to me. She added a tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter and always served it warm with vanilla ice cream. YUM!!! I bought some spiced peached the other day and plan to make this cobbler with them. I'll let you know how it turns out.

As far as I know, I have never eaten cobbler in my life. The texture was incredible, a little crispy/chewy on the surface with a sweet, gooey fruit filling underneath.  The flavor was pretty good, but I did feel it needed a little extra "something".  Like other reviewers, I found that one can of fruit wasn't going to be enough, so I used two cans, but drained the juice out of one of them before adding it to the pan.  I mixed the batter in a bowl and then transferred it to a greased pan, then added the fruit on top.  It took about 45 minutes for mine to bake to perfection.  I'll definitely make this again, but next time I think I'll take the advice of a few reviewers and add vanilla to the batter and cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches.  Thanks for sharing a great, easy dessert recipe!

Made it as per instructions. It took much longer time to set. After 30 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees F (as the recipe indicates), it wasn't brown or set. I raised the temperature to 400 and left it 15 min more and it browned but it was completely runny. I lowered the temperature again and left it for about 30-40 mins more, until my knife came out clean. So in total it was about 1 ½ hours in the oven. It came out alright, but a little bland, I think the other reviewer's advise of adding some vanilla would have made the cobbler better.

This dessert is extremely easy to prepare and my family liked it.  The only change I made is I used a big can of sliced peaches (15.5 oz), diced them and cooked them on stove top will all the juice from the can. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches.  I kept all other ingredients/measurements the same and baked it in a 9x13 pyrex dish.  I baked it for the time stated and thought it looked like it was still runny when done, but I took it out anyway.  The juice that looks runny thickens up after cooling down.  I will be making this dish again, many times. We didn't have ice cream to serve it with, was great on it's own.

Very easy. I love to cook. For an even better cobbler add 1 8 oz cream cheese to the butter and sugur, also add 1tsp cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla flavor. I served with whipped cream. Very delicious. Ohh, use a bigger cooking dish. Loved it!!!

My husband said this recipe is "peaches meet bread pudding ", I found it very salty,  because of the melted butter. I didn't have self rising flour so used 2 tsp of baking powder with the flour. I wouldn't make it again.  It was very bland,  I used splenda instead of sugar and that worked well. My husband is diabetic so I have to watch his sugar intake.

Just ok.  This turned out to be more like a peach cake then peach cobbler.  Mine came out very doughy.  I did add 2 tsp.'s of vanilla to the dough mixture and a tsp of cinnamon to the dough and to the peaches.  I also sprinkeled about a 1/4 of a cup to brown sugar to the cobbler prior to baking at 400 degrees for one hour.

I first tried this recipe in Germany 24 years ago!  It was a quick go to, delicious crowd pleaser.  I also add a bit of real vanilla and a bit of cinnamon.  It is very easy and tasty.  What more could you want in a cobbler.  My recipe is folded, spilled on and well used.  I have copied this for dozens of other home cooks. My hubby loves it warm with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream..  Blessings!

This is so easy and so delicious! I double this and add 2 tsp of vanilla to the sugar/flour mixture and I bake it in a deep casserole dish...it makes such a beautiful dessert and it's perfect with vanilla ice cream

A quick & easy dessert you can whip up at the last minute.  I add about 1/2-3/4 cup brown sugar. A rich cobbler which is more cakey than crusty and is yummy with vanilla ice cream!

Love this recipe BUT the cooking time is too short. Mine took an hour but it was worth it! I used my own canned peaches which were spiced. If I were to use store bought canned peaches I would add cinnamon and nutmeg. I will definitely make this again!

VERY EASY AND DELICIOUS!  I'm quite impressed with this. As per other reviews, I baked for an hour and it came out quite gooey...mmm...and I like how the ingredients are simple.   I made a couple of alterations: mixed in a little honey and cinnamon with the peaches and liquid, and used regular flour instead (with 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp bkg powder).  I also mixed the sugar in with the flour and melted the butter in the bottom first....seems like I changed the recipe entirely but these seem pretty fool-proof.

I'd say make this because my guests and family always love it. It is very sweet, but also delicious. It does take a bit longer to cook than specified. Originally I was hesitant because I'm a believer in the peaches being on the bottom... don't worry, the topping rises up beautifully (just make sure you leave enough room in the pan, it will grow). BTW, I always add more peaches.

Not sure what other people did wrong, but this comes out perfect everytime I make it! I love this cobbler. I do add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the mixture before baking it.

I read the recipie but I thought to myself that the flour would be a little tasteless so I decided to use a white cake mix instead of the flour and it turns out the cobber was delicious. All my family loved it. I might try the flour recipie someday too but to me the sweeter the better a desert is. That's how I see it anyway.

Very good recipe, but I also had to cook it about 45 minutes to get brown. And I sprinkles cinnamon and sugar over the top before baking. I've also made the same cobbler but using canned apples instead of peaches. Delicious!

This is the recipe my mother used for years. So easy! But it's even better if you use fresh peaches -- about 5 or 6, sliced. As another poster mentioned, try melting the butter in the pan in the oven, then adding the fruit and pouring the flour-sugar-milk mixture on top. Don't stir. And mine usually require 55-60 minutes to cook. A wonderfully simple and versatile dessert!

I made this for Easter dessert in a 9 x 13 dish, doubling the recipe and adding vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by other posters.  As they suggested, I cut down on the sugar and only used
1 1/2 cups sugar. Everyone loved the dessert, but I thought it was too sweet.  Next time when doubling, I will use only 1 cup sugar.  I cut the bread in 6 squares to the slice and when making again will just cut each slice in quarters. A quick, easy dessert that I will definitely make again.

I doubled the recipe and had to more than double the time in the oven.  I should've added 3 cans of peaches 2 with their juice and one without.  The flavor was wonderful though.

I tripled this recipe, and had to bake in a large lasagna pan. I baked it for an hour. I also added cinnamon with the sugar. Made the whole house smell great!! My husband enjoyed it. My 3 yr old daughter thought it was the best! My sons, ages 5,7,and 8 thought it was ok.

I added a 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract and a 1/2 tsp grated lemon peel to the batter. I also used 3 average sized fresh peaches. When fresh Colorado peaches are at peak season, why used canned peaches? I baked it a 375°F for 1 hour and the crust was a nice golden brown. I live at 6000 feet so baking is tricky up here, you may need to bake this cobbler for a shorter time, just keep an eye on it. Be sure to allow the cobbler to rest on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving it.

I really enjoyed this recipe... it was simple and amazing.  I did adjust the recipe for 12 servings and instead of two 15 ounces cans of peaches I just used 1 29 ounce can.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon (although afterward I wish I had used a full teaspoon).  It did cook for almost twice as long, that doesnt adjust in the directions.  It came out wonderfully and tasty MAGNIFICENT!!!!!

It says to bake the cobbler for 25 to 30 mins. The cobbler dough was still raw. I had to bake it for about an hour and then the dough was chewy. I did not care for this recipe.

This cobbler was incredibly easy to make.
I let it cook for about an hour. I also added a bit of cinnamon. I made it about 2 hours ago and it's all gone already. I'll be making this again...probably tomorrow. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a winner in my book.

Delicious. My customers loved this recipe.. not too sweet and the "crust" is just right! I added a dash of nutmeg and a tinch of cinnamon. Wondeful.

I had fresh peaches that needed to be used up and followed what another review suggested and the family loved it with vanilla ice cream. It was very similar to a blueberry cobbler recipe I have made. I think you could substitute any fruit.  Melt one stick of butter in an 8 x 8 pan, mix 1 tsp of lemon juice with 1 cup of sugar and about 4 cups of peeled, pitted sliced peaches (5 peaches) together; put this mixture on top of melted butter. Sprinkle cinnamon to suit your taste over top. Then mix together 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of milk. Place this topping all over the top of the peaches. Do not stir. Let bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes.

Not impressed with the results. I used fresh peaches. After 1/2 hour at suggested temp. it was still runny. I bumped up temp to 400 and baked another 30 minutes. It was bubbly and brown, the taste was good.

This turned out pretty good.  I added a little bit of cinnamon and vanilla extract to the dough mixture and needed to cook it for 50 minutes on 350.  I also used a bigger can of peaches, which made it drip in the oven a little bit, but that was my mistake for using a square 8x8 pan.  All in all it tasted pretty good.

I baked a peach cobbler like this from a recipe on canned peaches in 1955.  Everyone loved it and I made it for years.  I never wrote down the recipe, and when I tried to make it again,  years later,  I couldn't remember the recipe exactly.  It was very much like  this recipe,  but this one didn't turn out as well.  One thing I do remember is that it used a 29 oz can of peaches.  I also don't believe it called for self rising flour.  I wonder if anyone has THE ORIGINAL RECIPE,  that I once had.

This cobbler was HORRIBLE!  I made it last night to go with some homemade vanilla ice cream.  Needless to say, the ice cream is gone & only 1 small corner of the cobbler was even touched.  It did not have enough peaches, was not crusty or sweet enough.

I tweaked the recipe and added Vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg as recommended by a friend.  The crust wasnt a crust like cobbler but more like a muffin dough with a slightly odd rubbery texture where the peaches and crust met.  The family ate it but each had a comment on how to make it better.  I wont use this recipe again.

This recipe came out bad, I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using a much larger jar of peaches. The crust was just awful. It was a weird texture and had no flavor whatsoever. I took it to my neighbor's for dinner and was very embarrassed and disappointed. NO ONE liked it in the least.

This cobbler did not come out well at all for me. Maybe it's because I didn't use enough sugar. The topping came out really mushy. As others have said, you really have to cook this for an hour+.
I am still looking for an easy cobbler recipe that will give me a non cakey topping.

Very simple, maybe too simple!  The peaches should really be put in the pan first.  They get tough and shrivel on top otherwise.  I also, like other members, had to bump up the temperature and cook MUCH longer.  It took an hour to be done for me.  I also agree it needs some cinnamon, nutmeg, ect.  Recipe needs many adjustments!

this was the worst peach cobbler. i cooked it way longer than i should have and it was still thin and i even cut back on the juice. and to add to it it really was blan. it had a slight flavor of peaches and that was it. it was horrible. this is the second dessert ive made from here and both recipes sucked. and i followed them to a T!!! dont make this. make something a little more complex. i think thats where i went wrong i was trying to go for easy and spent more time  on something that tastes like !!!

great recipe- served it at a family birthday party & there wasn't a single person who didn't love it (even after i substituted 1/2 of the sugar for splenda & used light margarine instead of butter). i took the advice of some others & added cinnamon & vanilla.  i also used a bigger dish and cooked it longer than the recipe called for (i would recommend cooking for 50 minutes at 360 degrees then turning the oven off and letting it sit for 8-10 more minutes).  will definitely make this again & possibly try different fruit.

This cobbler was SO easy to make!  It was great warm, but I think it tastes even better cold!  I'm throwing out my old peach cobbler recipe!

I had to bake it longer than the time specified - about 55 minutes total - but I realize that oven temperatures do vary.  

I made it for the first time yesterday evening, and today my husband is STILL raving about how great it is!  Thanks for the great recipe!  :)

I LOVED IT!  I did add a little cinnamon to the batter mix and I also topped the peaches with some cinnamon.  I used a 9x13 glass pan and I doubled the peaches using only 1T of the syrup from the 2nd can.  I ended up baking it for a total of 50 min.  It turned out great!  VERY YUMMY!  I can't wait to make more...it was so easy.

I doubled the recipe and replaced about 1/2 cup of milk with buttermilk.....it turned out great. 
This turns out more like real southern cobbler....you know, doughy and sort of half dumpling like-half cake like. It was very good, and I didn't even add any vanilla or cinnamon like others did. It would probably be even better if I did! I give this one a 5! 
YUMMY!

This recipe was delicious, but I'm not sure under what circumstances it could be done in 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven!  I baked mine for about an hour at 350 and then had to boost it up to 400 for the next 20 minutes, and it still never browned.  And, yes, my oven was working, I had just made a lasagna not an hour before.

My husband made this and found it really easy to make. We both found it too sweet though and the next time he made it he omitted the sugar.

This turned out very well.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamon.  I served it warm with a bit of cream.  Delish!

I was looking for a good cobbler recipe and tried this one.  I altered it a little as I was using home canned peaches.  I didn't know how much juice I had compared with store bought canned peaches so I poured most of the juice out and then put a little cornstarch in the peaches before I poured the peaches and their juice over the batter.  

I also made a second batch and cut the milk and sugar way down to make more of a pastry top.  I was such a hit at a potlock dinner, that I never got seconds.

Great recipe! Not quite my granny's but it is still great! I used 2 cans of Peach pie filling instead of just the canned peaches. Add 2 tsp vanilla, 2tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. The filling liquid from the peaches caramelizes the crust and makes it that much better. Cook 350 deg/1hour.

I tried this recipe two times because the first attempt came out very runny and mushy. I thought perhaps it was a mistake on my part. Tried it again and made sure I followed the directions exactly, came out runny and mushy again. Not a good recipe for me.

This cobbler was nice and easy.  I did add cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla to the peaches for flavor.  I did have to bake the cobbler for about 35 minutes.  I liked it and so did my kids, but it wasn't a "wow" recipe.  I will make it again, though.

I made this last night. I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla and used 24 ounces of peaches with 1/2 of the juice. Bake it at 400 degrees for about 40 minutues.  It came out perfectly golden brown.  Enjoy!

This is a great! I love how fast it is to put together the cake itself needed a little more flavor so I added 2 tsp of vanilla. I also didnt have self rising flour so I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. It was a hit

This recipe tasted very similar to the one my mother made when I was growing up, but like everyone else I did have to cook it much longer than the directions called for. Also I had to bump up the oven temp to 400... I never got it to that beautiful golden brown color, but that might have been because I used a bigger can of peaches and more juice than the recipe called for. All in all it is a good recipe, but does need more heat and more time.

I have tried other recipies that are as easy, this one is good but it definatly needs to cook longer.  The first time I  made it, it was not still doughy/runny..very disapointed, but I made it again since it had good flavor and I baked it covered for 30min's then uncovered til browned and knife came out fairly clean

I have been using this recipe for 20+ years.  You can also switch out the fruit.  I often make it when I want to use up some fruit I have.  I just add sugar to the fruit place in a bowl cover with wrap and nuke it until the juices come out. I've used apples, blackberries, strawberries and figs.  I usually cook it for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  This is not a fancy cobbler but a quick and easy.  I always have these ingredients on hand and the recipe can be prepared in 5 minutes.

I have been cooking this recipe for a while now, it is wonderful. I love it, with double peaches or a can of pitted cherries, or with what ever fruit I have, thanks for this recipe, I can always count on it working, but I do have to bake it for  at least an hour.

My dear, sweet Mother shared this recipe with me 22 years ago when I was a young bride...(I was very much non-successful in the kitchen), and I remember her telling me "This recipe is so easy, you cannot go wrong!). My husband was always so impressed when I baked it. Now we have two teenage sons who absolutely love this peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream! My Mom has passed on, but I think about her and what she told me every time I bake it!!

This tasted fantastic! Our peaches were over-ripe and very sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. I also cooked it longer than the recipe called for -- the long side of the cooking range, and then turned the oven off but left the cobbler in the oven while we ran to the store for some ice cream. It was almost more like a bread pudding than a cobbler. I cooked it with two large ripe peaches (1.5 lbs before removing the skin and seeds) and one small cooking banana. I did not add anything in place of the juice that would have come in canned peaches. I think that many of the discrepancies on the reviews for this recipe (regarding how much sugar to add) are because of people using canned peaches "in real fruit juice" or "in syrup".

My mother has been making this dish for over 30 years. The only difference I see is that she uses a whole stick of butter and she doesn't cream them together. She melts the butter in the baking dish, then adds the crust ingredients and spoons in the peaches, not using all of the juice. I also sprinkle the top with a little sugar about 45 minutes in so that the top will get crispy and golden.

I've had better cobbler. This was not sweet enough for me, however, my daughter and husband loved it. 

I think that IF I make it again I'll add a couple tablespoons of sugar to the peaches and use fresh peaches instead of canned.

This was a breeze to make and I think it tastes better than my grandmas...don't tell her.

The only changes I made were minor. I used a HUGE 29oz can of peaches, made a nice design with them. I also drained most of the juice before adding it. 

Oh and it was VERY thick, so I cooked it probably 15-20 minutes longer until it was light brown.

Great recipe, thank you for that!

i love this recipe. I have also used splenda in place of the regular sugar.  Sugar free peaches and the splenda make this also an easily diabetic dish. I have also used moxed berrys in place of the peaches.   So easy, so fast. I do agree I tend to have to bake it for about 45 mins.

I made this for a Christmas dessert and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven, it came out beautifully and had lots of the "goo" in it that tastes so good.

Delicious!!! Is all I have to say and then some. It was a request and I couldn't say "I don't know how" so I did a google and found it on this site. Today was my first time making this. 20-30 minutes is too little time for it to set, so I let it cook for about 45 minutes. I also cooked it in my mini stoneware dish by Pampered Chef. Stoneware bakes from the inside out, so it gives it an excellent crust. I'll be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!!!

This was a great last minute recipe.  I layered it like Squeaky T's grandma, and added the cinnamon and nutmeg suggested by another reviewer.  Yum yum!  I had no problems with beautiful browning, but I did use a convection oven.

Cooked 40 minutes with last few minutes on broil to brown topping well.  Can substitute Pears for peaches.  Using the microwave, serve with Vanilla Ice Cream slighly warmed over a serving. (Using the blender to cream and mix the ingredients results is a fluffier/lighter texture topped with a nice crisp top after a few minutes of broiling.)

I made this dish for a coverd dish cookout that a friend had. It was good - I would had more than just one can as the recipe calls for -- thick juice, the peaches can get lost in the crust. Also serve immediately for a better tasting dish -- the cookout was a few hours later and it dried out slightly, but adding the extra can of peaches could help out in that area.

This recipe is excellent!  I made this recipe on a Saturday morning and it was gone by Saturday night!  I made again  on Sunday morning and it was gone again by Sunday night!  Needless to say, this recipe is definitely a keeper! The only variation I made was I used a can of 29 oz. peaches instead of the 15 oz.

Memo to self:  do not read reviews before trying for the first time.  Reason:  I mixed the advice of 2 reviewers.  First, I tripled the recipe (well I had a huge can of peaches from Costco).  Second, I  melted the butter in the oven, added the peaches and then poured the rest of the ingredients (which were mixed together) on top.  Baked all in a 10x14" Pyrex dish.  The butter bubbled vigourously from under the top mixture, spilled over and started burning after a while.  The kitchen was quickly filled with smoke and burning smell.  Managed to save cobbler and it tasted great.  Sons loved it with ice cream and peach sauce.  Will definitely try again but will stick with the original recipe.  Gotta go!  I have an oven to clean.

Excellent and easy!  I have made this several times the last time I used a bag of frozen mixed fruit and it was great!  I also like to use a larger pan to get more of a crispiness.

This is an easy recipe for peach cobbler. DO however add some cinnamon. It makes it even better. I had to cook this a little longer than the recipe time calls for. I suggest using slightly less ingredients than it you are supposed to use. My baking dish was too full, that is why it took so long to bake. But I still give it a thumbs up!

I made it how the recipe said, except one i used a deep dish and the other i used the 9 inch pan. The deep dish turned out fantastic, nice and creamy and flavorful. The 9 inch was good, but a little dry. Then i made my own glaze out of leftover peaches, lemon juice, butter, then brown and regular  sugar. Tasted great!

Just like my moms!!! Great and easy recipe. Like the others I baked about a hour to get it nice and brown. I also add 2 tsp of vanilla and a little cinnamon.

Too much dough - peaches ratio.  I only used 3/4 cup and reduced sugar.  Also, it didn't say whether to used the syrup with the peaches, so I used 1/2 of it.  I cooked at 360 degrees for 30 min and turned it off and left it in the oven without opening the door for additional cooking time.  The flavor turned out perfect even without enough peaches.

I used margarine instead of butter and I used water instead of milk (had to use what was available at the time). I must say I was surprised at how SWEET the cobbler is. I will absolutely be using less sugar, may take it down to 1/2 a cup next time being that the syrup in the canned peaches bumps up the sweetness factor to a highly inappropriate amount lol. I will also use a little more than a cup of flour, maybe a cup and a half. I hope I remember to come back and share my experience with the revision. Overall, I'm still going to eat every bit :)

This was easy and very good. I substituted Splenda for the sugar. We ate it topped with sugar free Cool Whip. The crust was a bit spongy and we loved it that way. I'll make this again.

It took at least an hour to cook and could have had a lot more flavor (cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla). The recipe isn't good as-is.

It was simple to put together but despite following the recipe exactly, I cooked it way over the time, 25min or so.  Yet it never did get fully cooked, mushy unfortunately.

This is the same recipe that i use to make peach cobbler. Sometimes i like to switch it up by using 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and add cinnamon sugar and a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the peaches.

This recipe was just ok. It needs more sugar. It also needs cinnamon. I had to bake it longer for it to be brown and my boyfriend got tired of waiting so he put the oven up to 400.  Now lets see what he says about the taste. 

My 12 yr old says its ok. he also says that it should be rated 3 stars out of 5.
I think its ok.

I liked this recipe, but I think it needs two cans of peaches, and it took at least an hour to brown.  It would be awesome heated with ice cream.  I will make this again.

Yum Yum.  Tastes like butter cake.  I was skeptical b/c of the simple ingredients and easy prep but this will definitely be served as a dessert at our house for years to come.  Only bad part - i have a true to temp oven and i had to bake it for about an hour to brown the top.  Keep this in mind when you are making this.

I'm only giving this a 3 because even though I thought it tasted good, I don't think it was that great alone.  I tried a piece without ice cream and it was good, but with ice cream it was great.  I made the recipe as is.  I would like for the cobbler to not settle so much once it cools.

A very easy recipe. However I added cinnamon (about a teaspoon) and a dash of nutmeg. It also took about an hour to bake. I also think that it would have been better with more peaches. But overall it turned out pretty well. I topped it with powdered sugar and served with vanilla ice cream.

This is a great recipe and i t was just as easy as the description says it will be. I went out on a limb and tried it with canned dark sweet cherries in heavy syrup and it came out great. The only thing I did differently was I added a little bit of nutmeg and ground cinnamon to the batter. About 1/8 tsp. and 1/4 tsp. respectively. It was a big hit!

This is much better if you use 4 to 6 FRESH peaches! I also added 1/2 c blueberries. For a little more flavor, I added a couple of tablespoons of apricot preserves to peaches. This might make the canned peaches a little more flavorful.

I just got done eating this and thought it was pretty good, but i have never had cobbler before so i have nothing to compare to.  I did add cinnamon and vanilla like someone else said. It probably would have been good with ice cream if i had some.  It was only crusty on the top the inside was gooey, did i make it right??

I made this today for Mothers Day and everyone loved it and it really hit the spot, since, the weather was rainy and cool.  I took the suggestion of a couple of others and used the cinn, nutmeg and vanilla and replaced the sugar with half regular Splenda and half Splenda brown sugar.  I also replaced the butter with I Cant Believe Its Not Butter spray - Original flavor for a very low fat version.  Im not a big baker, but when I do I use this in any recipe that calls for butter.

Both of my grandmother's used to make an awesome cobbler.  We would go picking blackberries on our farm in Kentucky and an hour later, the most delicious blackberry cobbler to be had was served before us!  It always amazed me how they never had recipes...all by memory or a sense of "what looked right."  I now live in Portugal and make this cobbler all the time for my friends here.  THEY LOVE IT.  I actually think that this is the closest to my grandmother's cobbler that I can get.  Simple and easy to prepare.  I cut down on the sugar, though but that is the beauty of the recipe. Thanks for this...

I live in Poland and it is difficult to get fresh fruit, I tried this recipe and it was wonderful, I doubled the filling and it was so moist.  Everyone loved it.  I also added a bit of cinnamon.  Will remain a favorite!

I love this recipe.  I have shared it with alot of my friends and they have all given it very positive reviews.  I love that it is quick and easy.  You can whip it up in 10 or 15 minutes.  I always keep ingredients in the cupboard to make a cobbler!

I made some changes: halved the butter, used 3/4 the sugar, replaced self-rising flour with all purpose flour plus baking soda and salt, used canned pineapple rings instead of peaches, omitted the juice, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla, and sprinkled flour and brown sugar on top.  I baked the cobbler for 30 minutes, then put the lid on the dish, then baked for 10 minutes more.   Some reviewers said it was too gooey, but mine settled nicely after coming out of the oven.  It's absolutely delicious and has a great texture.  I would definately serve this to company.  Any canned fruit would probably work.

I make this Peach Cobbler, as is, at least twice a week,...every week!  I don't add anything else to it.  It's not too sweet, and certainly not too bland.  The only thing I do different is bake it for 50 minutes, instead of 25-30, til it's golden brown.  Then I eat it hot with cream poured over it, or vanilla ice cream, but I prefer the cream.  And you can heat it in the microwave the next day, and it's just as it was when you took it out of the oven.

It's really simple and easy to make. It did taste good as is but I thought it was a really safe recipe to experiment with.
I used a strawberry mixture(14oz slightly mashed strawberries, tbs of lemon juice, tsp of cornstarch) in place of peaches.
I used half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. I threw in a tsp of salt and a tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning in dry ingredients. I didn't have regular milk so I used evaporated milk. 
This cobbler kills at every event I bring it and never last a week at home. My friend who doesn't like cooked fruit even loved it.

I didn't have self rising flour so I used Bisquick mix instead. I also only had a one pound can of sliced peaches so I put the whole can in.  It is taking longer than the 25-30 minutes to cook though but it looks and smells good. I am currently at 45 min. @ 350.  50 min. total but oh it's so good!!

This is a great, easy recipe that's quick to make.  I did make a couple minor changes.  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter.  It is how my Mom and Grandma made peach pies, and I love the taste and smell.  I didn't have a 9" square pan so made it in my small oblong pan which is @ 8 1/2 by 6.  It took longer to bake - 45 minutes rather than 30, to get the cobbler top browned.

I don't understand how this has such rave reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe states and did not like it. I grew up in the south eating peach cobbler and this one is not good. There is too much butter and milk. The crust portion is much too soft and gooey. When you pour the can of peaches including the syrup, there should be a more dry dough mix to bake and absorb the syrup. The dough is very wet. I would not make this again.

I made it exactly like the recipe and it was very good. I believe it would have been better if i had used a  more shallow dish. I believe it would have been a little less doughy.

This was a really good recipe, easy to make. I only added 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder because I didn't have self rising flour it was so good my husband asked me to make it again for his birthday instead of cake.

I copied another reader's suggestion:  melt the butter into the bottom of the pan, pour peaches over the top - sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg on top of the peaches and then mix together the milk, flour & sugar.  Pour the milk mixture right in the center of the peaches. By the end of baking the milk mixture rises to the top and makes an awesome topping. I may try adding vanilla the next time around per another person's comment. I double the recipe as my boys love it!

I used all-purpose flour and 2 tsp baking powder. Cut sugar in half (good move) and used less butter (it was still too much). It was OK. Too runny. Baked about an hour!
No, wouldn’t make again.

Had to cook it for 2 1/2 hours and it still had raw dough.

This recipe has been in my family since before my grandmother and I am 58 yrs. old. All of the ingredients are correct. But you mix together your  milk, flour, and sugar. Melt your butter in your dish in the preheating oven until its good and hot. Pour your batter in the hot butter and pour your peaches on top of the batter, and do not stir. Do not cover and your crust will have deliciously crisp edges, and a nice gooey cake like center.  Very good indeed!!! Enjoy!!

I must be missing something. I followed the recipe exactly. So many of you have given this recipe 4-5 stars. Something must be wrong with my palate because I didn't like this very much at all. At firs sight I noticed after cooking it for 1 hour the dough never formed into a crust. I went ahead a put 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It didn't help this recipe taste any better. I love peach cobbler and thought this would be a winner. I was disappointed.

While very easy to make, it was painfully flavourless.  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg, but it wasn't enough to make it taste like anything. Also, it didn't take anywhere close to 25-30 minutes to bake.  After 55 minutes, I increased the temperature, but it still took another 10 minutes.

Not as good as I had hoped.  It took a long time to cook.  It never did brown on top and it wasn't sweet at all.  If I were to try it again, I would definitely alter the recipe as others have.

While it is simple and easy to make, I found it way too sweet and it did take much longer to brown. I could see myself liking it with much less sugar, and with the variations suggested in other reviews (adding cinnamon or vanilla extract).

I made 3/4 of the recipe and used a can of cherry pie filling (in a large glass pie plate) for cherry cobbler. I thought it was a bit too buttery. My boyfriend loved it! I made the recipe the same way again today for him. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was my first time making peach cobbler. I added some brown sugar on top and had to bake an additional 25 minutes until it was golden brown. The kids and hubby loved it though. Will make it again.

I'm making this tonight just as the recipe calls BUT I can't seem to understand a peach coobler with no cinnamin so I MUST add this into my peach mixture then 2 TBSNs into the batter itself.

Wow! Although this was not a cobbler as I remember - maybe I was thinking more of a peach crisp, but it was amazing! My daughter ate it the next morning for breakfast and an after-school snack.  So easy - I used fresh peaches and blue plums and it was magnificent. Thanks for sharing! This has definitely become a family favorite :)

We love this recipe.  My husband made it for his church and was one of the winners in a cobbler contest.  We will definitely make it again!

This is a good start!  I use one can of "regular" canned peaches and one can of peach pie filling~~~~so it wont be so runny.  I also used frozen pie crust on top.  I'm all about the crust!  It came out GOOD this way.

this is a great recipe I've been using this one for 8 years or more now and I use 2 cans of peaches as well as dicing them instead of leaving them whole... I like peaches and depending on your own taste this recipe is VERY easy to modify... My sisNlaw likes more dough than peach so she uses less peaches....either way it always turns out great... Have tried it with pinapples and blueberries as well... GREAT...

This was a great recipe!  I did the same as the previous reviewer and added the nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon. Also I used fresh peaches instead (about 5 medium sized) peeled placed them in a small pot over the stove, added a little bit of water and 2 tsp vanilla, 2tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a couple teaspoons of sugar.  I let that cook for a few minutes until there was a syrupy consistency. I had people over that night and everyone loved it.  Oh and it tastes so good with vanilla ice cream!  I will be making this again for sure...
