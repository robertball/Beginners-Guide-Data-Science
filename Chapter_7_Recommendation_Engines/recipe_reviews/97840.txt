Wow, was this delicious! I made a few alterations - a friend who lived in Spain said you can substitue turmeric for the saffron without much taste difference and it worked great. I also had a bag of frozen paella seafood mix from Sam's Club - so I just guesstimated the amount needed. Use chicken breast chunks instead of thighs.  I also followed the suggestion to substitue a can of Rotel (used Habenero Rote) for part of the diced tomatoes and that added GREAT flavor. This makes more than enough for 6 people though - we have a ton of leftovers, although that's ok as I don't mind leftovers! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Lots of great ingredients and I was excited to try. A little disappointed. The rice was not quite cooked and I had to overcook the seafood to accomlish this. Maybe it wasn't enough liquid. I would use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 14 oz. The overall flavor was quite bland. Needed more spices....at a bare minimum some black pepper...and some red pepper or hot sauce if you like it spicy. I think I will also use some chicken broth to replace the 6 cups of water. Open to trying it again with these changes.

I made this yesterday with just a couple changes. I omitted the chicken and used fish broth rather than water. I would maybe use a mixture of fish and chicken broth next time for a little more flavor but this was overall a really yummy dish. Such an easy recipe once you have everything assembled. The combination of seafood was absolutely delish!

I served this up for a dinner party and wowed my guests.  I've never made paella before, but this was pretty easy.  I had to make a few alterations to the ingredients including a whole red bell pepper rather than the green, and I used a different selection of seafood.  I omitted the peas and used basmati rice in lieu of instruction and it worked really well.  Thanks for the lovely recipe!  I'll be passing it around the whole family.

We had  a few changes of our own.  We used the rotel as someone else recommended. But, we only used half can of the habinaro Rotel.  Couldnt get clams or mussells, so, we added some halibut and salmon.  Increased the amount of shrimp and calamari.   We didnt have any saffron so we used 2 packages of saffron rice instead.  Overall it was awesome!!

This was very easy to make. My family loved it. As with most recipes, taste is subjective. We like spicy, so I made a few changes. I used a mixture of vegetable broth and fish stock (I made the fish stock with the shrimp and lobster shells). Maybe 1/2 cup white wine? As suggested by another reviewer I used a 14 oz. can of Rotel Tomatoes, I would change that to 28 oz. I added 2 tsp. of HOT paprika, too. Could use more heat, even with that added. I would also suggest not stirring so much, makes the rice mushy. Don't get me wrong, we LOVED this recipe and would recommend this easy recipe to anyone! Plenty of food leftover.

Great recipe! Definately use the chicken broth instead of water. Add a beer with the chicken broth for great flavor. Lobster is fantastic in this dish. If you like to have some heat, throw some red pepper flakes in. We had a great time making and eating it.

I just spent a couple months studying in Spain where paella became my favorite food.  This was good, but not quite what my host mom made for me.  The rice could use a little more flavor.

Have made this twice now with great results. Definately wait until the final step before adding your seafood. The shrimp, clams, scallops, etc only need to simmer for about 10 minutes. I used half chicken broth and half water instead of all water. I also use Mexican Saffron, which is much cheaper, but you need to double or triple the amount to get the right flavor. Finally, I added sausage both times and it really adds another dimension. I used mild Italian sausage the first time and kielbasa the second. Both were really good. I did use chicken thighs both times, but boneless breast would honestly be easier.

Loved it!  The only thing I did different was to use shrimp shell broth instead of water.  A hearty paella, thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

This was delicilous, i cut the recipe down to serve 2 people and there was still enough leftover for the next day. I didn't add the chicken, however I did add calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp, jumbo prawns, scallop, cuttlefish, cod, and salmon chunks. I also added a dash of paprika, parsely(fresh), crushed red chilli and orgeano. and i substitued the water for chicken stock. 
It was a total hit, will definately be making this again!

This recipe is so delicious. I used one can tomato sauce and frozen seafood mix. The amount is a lot (enough for about 5 or 6 people).

Great recipe overall, but our rice required at least 10 more minutes at a simmer to not be crunchy. We also followed advice to use chicken stock for 4 cups of the liquid, some hot sauce and rotelle. Makes enough for family plus company!

Wow!! I used 2 1/2 lb skinless boneless chicken thighs cut into quarters...I used 1 3/4 C. rice, 2 frozen chopped tomatoes and a splash of vegetable juice, 2 tsp. turmeric, 1 T. smoked paprika, 1 onion, 1 red bell pepper and 1 orange bell pepper, 1 lb. bay scallops, 1 lb. jumbo shrimp- I shelled them and made shrimp stock from them for the liquid in this recipe. I used 1 1/2 lbs cooked mussels in the shell, 1 C. peas, salt, pepper, 2 cloves chopped/smashed garlic....I sauteed the chicken in olive oil and fresh cracked black pepper, then removed, put onions and garlic in pan for a minute and sautéed, then added peppers for another 2 minutes. Then added rice, 1 lb. sliced fresh mushrooms, seasonings and shrimp stock, red pepper flakes, and chicken pieces back in. Brought to a simmer on med-high- stirred a LOT...then when 15 minutes was up, dumped in peas, shrimp, calamari, scallops, and mussels. Put lid on, turned to low and simmered for 10 min. This made  a LOT! Too much for my Dutch oven- (I don't have a wok or a paella pan). I scooped out a bowl full. This took me 2 hours from getting ingredients out of the freezer and fridge, chopping, washing up as I went and cooking. The cooking only took about 30-35 minutes. The biggest amount of time was prepping beforehand. I will make this for company when I want to impress someone:) This is DELICIOUS!! The only thing I forgot was to garnish w/ lemon wedges.

This dish is so yummy and easy!  The only thing I changed, is I used chicken broth instead of water.  And it seems like this could serve more than 6, maybe 8.  It made a lot!

I made this recipe this past weekend for my husband's birthday/Valentine dinner. It was wonderful and so easy. Lots of nice color to the dish. I added a dozen mussels as well as littleneck clams. I also added a variation of clamari so there were also the little spider like tentacles for texture. All in all, my dinner was a huge success. Thanks.

I didn't have any saffron on hand, but I had saffron rice (with the seasoning in the packets). I used 3c of that and substituted 3c of seafood broth for 3c of the water, and 1c white wine for 1c of the water.  I added 3 tbs chopped green olives, 1c peas, 1c smoked sausage, 2 tbs smoked paprika, 2 tsp salt, 1 tbs black pepper, and one minced Jalepeno for a little heat. It turned out amazing and I will definitely make it again. It got rave reviews by the dinner guests and there are plenty of leftovers for tomorrow.

Excellent paella!  Just to be sure, I cooked all the meat separately, and added after the rice was cooked (I baked chicken thighs and took the meat off the bone.)  Instead of water, I used 6 cups chicken broth plus 2/3 cup of white wine, and also let it cook an extra 10 minutes.  Like many other reviewers, I added thawed, frozen peas when I added the meat. 
FIRST TIME PAELLA MAKERS, READ AS MANY REVIEWS AS YOU CAN BEFORE MAKING!  All these reviews will greatly help you achieve a perfect entree!  :D  This is a WONDERFUL, fool-proof dish to make for company! Serve with some fresh fruit and maybe some cornbread for a perfect meal!

This is a very good Paella recipe, but I would cut the rice in half and add more shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops,etc.

I was skeptical when I read the recipe because it didn't have any chicken/seafood broth in it.  As expected, it was a pretty dry and not very flavorful paella.  I've had much better.  It didn't have that seafood flavor that defines a paella, instead, it just tasted like rice with some seafood on it.

First time making paella, but made a few changes. I added about a pound of chicken breast tenders instead, hubby didn't want any bones. Instead of using water I used chicken broth and reduced the amount from 6 cups to 4 cups. I saw in a another recipe to add a bay leaf and i did. Definitely brought together the flavors. Last but not least i added large cooked shrimp and fully cooked mussels. AMazing we usually pay $45 at a local restaurant for this and now we can just make it ourselves. Overall great recipe. Hope this helps!!

We recently ate our way through Barcelona, trying different paella dishes. This recipe is one that comes really close to what is served there.  Most other recipes on the web have chorizo in them, which is NEVER used in the better restaurants since it overwhelms the taste of the seafood. You can add whatever veggies or extras you want to this as well. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This was delish!  I did do a couple things different.  I didn't have thighs so I used chicken breasts, I used turmeric since I didn't have saffron and I used zucchini instead of peas because we didn't have any of those either.  Even with all the substitutions it as really yummy!  We will definitely make it again - thanks for the yummy recipe. :)

I WISH I took a picture! But the guest dug in so quickly, and demolished this. A fantastic recipe!

I never thought a first time made paella recipe would turn out so good! My bible study friends loved it and  I was so so happy with it. Just as a comment, I added sausage, diced pork ( little) and scallops. I used parsley flakes and paprika for color added to saffron. Rice came out perfect  a little softer than al dente. I used chicken breasts so I also added chicken bouillion for flavoring. 
Thanks for a great recipe in 4 steps!!!!

I've made this recipe at least ten times it's excellent and rivals any Paella dish I ate in Barcelona when I was there. I highly recommend it!

I will definitely make this dish again. I read the majority of the reviews and decided to make my own adjustments like using less water. I did 4 cups instead of 6 from the comments stating it was too mushy or more like risotto. I also subbed the calamari rings for beef smoked sausage and used Rotel instead of plain tomatoes. If I had chicken broth I would have used that instead of water. Also the next time I make this dish I will be using more meat then the recipe calls for.  Overall we really enjoyed this and I cant wait to try again!!

Get rid of the onions, garlic, and bell pepper in order to make a mild but still delicious version of the paella.  Although the children in our house did not like it, I grew up loving paella, so it's worth a try.

This was a good paella recipe, but it was a bit bland for us and the rice to seafood ratio is way too heavy on the rice. Next time we'll reduce the rice to 2 cups, which will still be plenty. I know paella isn't supposed to be spicy, but we enjoy a bit of fire. We added hot pepper sauce to ours and it was much more to our liking.

Not my favorite, a lot of rice and a bit on the bland side.  Added red pepper flakes at the table to pep it up a bit, think the Rotel idea would be good and adding some paprika as I've seen in other recipes. Added the seafood at the end, still plenty of seafood flavor and it wasn't overdone.

I chose this recipe since it seemed to be one of the most authentic  on the site. I made it for mother's day lunch and the results were absolutely delicious! I was a little worried because my father is a tough critic when it comes to food and a master rice maker but he loved it and even had seconds. The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water. An excellent dish with room for variation. Thanks for this excellent recipe- will be making for company soon!

I made this for a group of our friends, after we returned from Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain). It was a hit! I did adjust it slightly. I used Rotel to replace the crushed tomatoes and chicken broth to replace the water. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe from your family heritage.

Wait to add seafood and peas  until  rice is almost cooked. I use whatever seafood is a bargain, but try to always add lots of mussels and clams for their wonderful flavor. We also like a little heat with a bit of cayenne or hot sauce added. I've made this many times and the chicken often remains as a left over, so now I use smoked sausage to round out the meal. I too use a mix of turmeric and paprika as an inexpensive substitute for saffron.

I made this for New Year's Eve with a friend who has the big paella pan, and it was delicious and looks so impressive. I used large shrimp and scallops, littleneck clams, mussels, freshly made chorizo, and chicken thighs (next time I would not include the mussels or clams but will add salmon). Following some of the other reviews, I used a combination of white wine and chicken broth for the liquid, and 28 oz of crushed tomatoes. I added a sprinkle of hot paprika. I served some hot curry Spanish olives on the side.

So I'm no expert chef but I do have to say this was really good.  My wife and I tried it tonight and we really liked it.  Will plan on making this again in the future.
