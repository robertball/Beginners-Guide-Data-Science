I liked this recipe, so did my boys who are 4 & 2.  I do suggest a couple changes though.

*I added Shredded Cheddar Cheese to the mixture when I mixed all the ingrediants on the stove, as well as some of my own extra spices.  It gives it that extra little hint of flavor and it was really yummy!

*Also, the recipe calls for 10 3/4oz of milk, I added 10 oz (which is a cup) and it was just a little runny.  I think I would only add 3/4 a cup next time.

I will make it again though!  It was fast, easy and a tummy pleaser! :) Thanks Andrew & Amy!

my husband and i along with both my children really liked this! i doubled the recipe and cooked 1 chopped onion with the grnd. beef along with 1 tblsp. montreal steak seasoning and 2 tblsp. worcestershire sauce. i added 1- 4 oz. can sliced mushrooms to the soup mixture and topped that with 1-2 cups shredded cheddar jack cheese before putting the tater tots on top. if you want the tots brown and crispy, turn the broiler on for 2-3 minutes at the end of cooking with oven door cracked. we think this dish has really good flavor for a simple week night meal. p.s. make sure you drain all juice out of bean and mushroom cans before adding to mixture and use half the milk called for.

Very bland until I did a few things. This is what I did and turned out WONDERFUL!!!! I used 2 lbs of beef, 1 can cream of mushroom soup. No milk, 1 can of tomato soup, 1 can grren beans,and a whole bag of tator tots. I put the meat down in the pan mixed all the stuff together all but the tots put that over the hambuger them I put the tots on cooked covered for 50 min at 350 them I put 2 cups cheese on top and cooked until the cheese was melted....Turned out beautiful. My husband will ask for it 3 times a month and he don't like casseroles. My kids are the same way...Try this way and you will like it more. Rememebr to season the meat how you like I use allpine touch and all purpose seasoning salt and garlic.

As simple as this recipe was, it came out wonderful. I followed directions exactly. My husband isn't a "casserole" kind of guy but he LOVED it.  My 19 year old son actually "licked" his plate. LOL I am now sending this recipe home with my son for him and his room mates to try themselves since it's so simple for them to make. Will make again!

I have changed this recipe some, I use 1 lb. hamburger, 1 can of cream of mushroom, or chicken, or celery, or even onion soup, 12 oz. of shredded cheese and top with the tater tots. Some times I  add onions to the meat when I brown it.

I'd been hunting for this recipe, it's one my brother likes. This was pretty good but kind of bland and runny. Add S&P and a little less milk, maybe some french fried onions under the tater tots would give it more flavor and maybe some worchestershire sauce on the burger while it's browning.. just a suggestion.

Didn't have much milk so I went through the reviews and improvised: I seasoned 1 lb. meat with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, and worcesteshire, and sauteed some diced poblano pepper with meat. I put the meat and peppers on the bottom of 9x13. I added a layer of French fried onions on top. Then, in the same skillet I cooked the meat in, I heated the cream of mushroom, 2 cans drained green beans, and 1 small can tomato sauce. I added this on top, then the tots, then some shredded cheese. Very homey and yummy!

I followed most of the recipe as it was and also made some other changes as suggested.  I did the onion with the ground beef and since I couldn't find my garlic powder I used Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning.  Like other people said, season it to taste.  I didn't try it with the cheese but I did put a layer of Frence Fried onions on (yum)before the taters.  Everyone, even hubby, loved it and he and I put a couple of spoons of sour cream on top of ours for the added kick.  Super awesome.

This recipe was really good and the kids loved it.  It was so easy my 4 year old was able to help.  Maybe next time I will add a little pepper before baking for a little more flavor, and maybe a little less milk. But otherwise it was great.

This was definately easy and fast to prepare, but my husband & thought it was only "ok" tasting.  We give it 3-1/2 stars.  I think it is a great recipe if you have kids though!

I just made this again and threw in what I had - it was even better than before. 3/4 lb ground meat, heaping tsp garlic, red bell pepper, celery, onion and a good dash of garlic salt. After cooking that up I added the soup and milk, stirred and put into a casserole dish. Topped it with frozen mixed veggies then cheese. At this point I put it in the fridge for the day - overnight would have been fine. Later I cooked it covered about 30 min then put on as many tater tots as looked right and cooked uncovered another 30 minutes until the potatoes were done. Very good and filling on a cold night and I really like make ahead stuff. Great dish Drew and thanks to "something different again?!" for posting the picture that made me think of mixed veggies and cheese.

Our family thought this was excellent!  The only couple of things I did differently was (1) used ground turkey instead of ground beef, (2) added poultry seasoning to the browned turkey meat, and (3) added cheddar cheese before adding the tater tots.  Very good, very easy, and we all had seconds!

Not a bad casserole as is but I made some changes to mine... first i doubled it for a 9x13 pan... I also cut back the milk to a cup and a half (for the 9x13 pan) added a can of mushrooms and some shredded cheese under the tater tots... these additions seemed to make it a little better... not a bad recipe though... very simple

This was a good, quick and easy casserole to throw to gether on a week night.  The family enjoyed it.  I would probably add some seasonings to this to give a little more kick next time, but I will make again.

Ok, people here make a big deal out of a simple recipe. You don't have to follow the recipe excactly. In fact, I never even use recipes (a tip I picked up in culinary school) because most of the time, they're not right. Back to the point, though. I was pressed for time and decided to make a tater tot casserole. I threw in cream of broccoli, some broccoli spears, extra sharp cheddar, along with my ground round (with garlic salt/pepper)...turned out magical. Didn't measure a thing, just used my common sense. Reading the reviews on this entire website are comical because it's obvious...some cannot cook and actually turn very simple dishes in to a drawn out process and blame the recipe. If you're sitting there with measuring cups and measuring spoons for a simple casserole, something's wrong and it's not the recipe.

The first time I made this dish, according to this recipe, it was bland and soupy (but still edible and good, since I love green beans and beef). Last night I made it a second time, and I still had problems with it being soupy, but I added one of Tastfully Simple's meat spices to the beef while I cooked it to give it flavor. I also topped the dish with cheese before I baked it. Overall, I think I will omit the milk the next time I make this dish, but it's definitely a keeper in my book!

I liked the texture of the Tater Tot Casserole.
I didn't like the taste of it thought because we used Cream of Celery Soup instead of Cream of Mushroom. 
It was not very tasty.

My kids liked this recipe.  I thought it was a little bland and slightly watery and I didnt add the full amout of milk. I did use 1lb of gr. beef instead of 1/2 lb which im glad I did otherwise it would have been even more watery. I will probably make this again with a few changes.

This was a pretty good tater tot casserole, better then the last recipe I tried on here but still wasn't very memorable. I made mine a bit differently, this is what I did. I used 1 lb. of hamburger and while I browned it I used salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and some steak seasoning (Lawrys to be exact) I drained the meat, added the one can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of milk and that seemed to be the perfect consistency for 1 lb. of hamburger. I added one can of corn instead of green beans, and mixed about half a bag of shredded cheddar cheese to it, topped with tater tots, baked for a half hour, took it out and topped it with the rest of the bag of cheddar and then baked for about another 10 mins until the cheese was melted. It wasn't a bad casserole but it just needs a little more 'spunk' than the recipe lists. Over all, I'd say give it a try but add your own seasoning, and plenty of them. (:

At school, we didn't have any cream of mushroom on stock so we used cream of celery soup. I didn't really like it. The tator tots were the best part.

Followed the recipe as indicated. Looked great, smelled good, but I did not care for this. The meat portion was pretty nice, but with the tater tots- no. I might make the meat again and add real potatoes, but it'll be a while before my family forgets how bad this was. I ended up making a frozen pizza instead.

WOW - this is delish!!  A huge hit, not only for me but for my husband and the kids as well!  I doubled the recipe and baked it uncovered in a 13'x9' pan.  Based on prior reviews, I reduced the milk (I used 1-3/4 cup milk total, for the doubled recipe), and I added 8 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese (mixed in with everything before topping it with the tater tots).  Turned out perfect...creamy and moist but not runny.  The tater tots were thoroughly cooked and not too mushy.  Will definitely be making again!

This stuff is so good that even the pickest person would eat it. It sounds weird but oh so good. I use 1 pound ground beef, onion, garlic, half a bag of frozen veggies, green beans, half cup on milk, cream of mushroom soup, montreal steak seasoning, and an entire bag of tater tots. You will not be disappointed.

I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I added a splash of worshetershire sauce, 1/2 package of sharp cheddar cheese, I used roasted garlic mushroom soup.  I then added a thin layer of french fried onions between the meat and tot layer.  I also turned the broiler on during the last 8 min of cooking.  Wonderful dish, but no leftovers :)

This is a great classic.  I used a small bag of  frozen vegetables and a pound of hamburger (half turkey burger).  Some other tater tot casserole recipes call for cheese, but I don't miss it and with the extra veggies this is a healthier version.

To make this lower calorie: I made this with ground turkey. Instead of milk I just mixed half can of water with the soup. I layered meat first, then green beans, then soup on top of that. Then put the tater tots on top and baked at 425 for 45 minutes.

This dish is impossible to have leftovers with.  Even if I increase the size of the casserole, it still disappears and the only request I have had from anyone is to "MAKE MORE next time!"  I do add a couple more things to it and it is fabulous.  I add a dash of white cooking wine, about a 1/4 cup of sour cream, and shredded cheese right under the tots.  Makes an excellent dish.  Simple and quick, this is a great recipe that anyone will love!

Edited to add:  I also add a little Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger meat.  It gives it a wonderful flavor when paired with the wine and sour cream.  LOVE it!!

Took some reviewers suggestions.  Used 1/2 beef and 1/2 ground turkey w/ an onion, garlic, garlic powder and Worcestershire.  Added some frozen corn instead of green beans and cheese on top of the meat mixture.  This was good, but not to die for...I may make it again.

Better than I expected. I used mixed veggies instead of green beans,added chopped onion to the burger and topped with cheddar cheese (still was basically the same flavored dish). It was a good, weeknight "all-in-one" dinner that dh liked. I will (occasionally) make again.

This is a good recipe. We use 1 lb. of ground beef rather than the 1/2. We also use regular green beans rather than the french-style. I only use 1/2 cup of skim milk. This cooks up perfectly.

This is a great, cheap meal. I first saw it on the show about the Duggar family... you know, the Baptist family that has 19 kids, lol.  I'm not a big fan of mushroom soup recipes so I may use cream of chicken or celery instead, but it tastes good. It's a comfort food for sure.

WOW this was soooo yummy!!!  I sauteed lots of chopped onions, then mixed in the ground beef (one pound), and added Worcestershire, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Definitely cut back on the milk - I used about half a can.  Instead of green beans I used mixed veggies and added a layer of shredded mexican blend cheese on top of the meat/soup mixture before putting the tater tots on top.  We ate the whole pan in one sitting - my husband and kids were fighting over the last portion! Super easy, tasty, and filling!

My whole family enjoyed this.  I added extra garlic and put the cheese on top of the meat mixture. This time I added corn along with the green beans.  Next time, I will use mixed vegetables to sneak in even more veggies. :)

I hate when people change the recipe and then rate it poorly.  Well, I did change the recipe, but I think my changes make it great, that's different right?  I used a whole pound of ground beef and added a tablespoon of Montreal steak seasoning.  I also added about a cup of shredded Colby jack, cheddar cheese.  I did not have that high expectations for it, but the kids ate it up and I enjoyed it too.  There seemed to be some confusion about the 10 3/4 ounces milk.  That is a soup can full which is what I added and it came out perfect.

This recipe calls for too much milk.  It made the casserole bland and runny.  I think cutting it down to 1/2 or 3/4 of a cup of milk would make it much better.

This was incredible!!  I used 2 cans mushroom soup, regular grenn beans but I chopped them up, just a few splashes of milk, 1.5 lbs hamburger and mixed in frendch friend onions.  I also added garlic powder and onion powder and pepper.  Mixed that all together and topped with tater tots.  Everyone LOVED this and it was very easy.  Thanks for sharing!!

A good weekday supper.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added a can of tomato sauce.  My husband came home much earlier than expected, so to speed things along.  I mixed everything for the sauce in the pan on the stovetop, got it warm quickly, microwaved the tator tots til warm.  Added the tots on  top and threw in a 450 degree oven until they got a little crunchy.  A good recipe, but a little salty for me, but I like no salt.  Will make again.

I'm writing this as I'm eating this... I just made a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and used a can of cream of chicken with a can of cream of celery instead of the mushrooms. I also added some Lawreys seasoning salt to the meat! I also used freshly canned green beans (yum!) and we added about 3/4 cups of shredded chedder!!! Absolutely delicious!

I used to eat this as a kid all the time.  I leave the vegitables out of it for a personal preferance.  It is like comfort food.

I tried it with both ground beef and ground turkey. With the turkey I used cream of chicken soup and my family preferred it that way.

This is similar to a recipe I have made for years, my husband loves it!  I use 2 cans of soup, one cream of celery and one cream of mushroom with no milk.  I also add cheddar chees to the top to make it really yummy!  A true comfort food!

This recipe is a hit.  I didn't use the entire amoun of sour cream and I added some skim milk.  I added a little thyme to the corn flake crumb topping.

This got the thumbs up at dinner.  The beef (I used ground turkey) and bean mixture beneath the tater tots is not the most appetizing-looking, but everyone seemed to like it, and it is very quick and simple.  The only thing I added was salt and pepper.

This was comfort food.  I did add shredded cheese and subsituted homestyle potatoes with the tater tots.  I also seasoned the ground beef with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Also added a drained can of mushrooms.  Would make this again for a fast, easy meal.  Thanks!

My mom made this when we were kids and we loved it; however, it needs some help for "grown-ups". I added onion and garlic with the meat, and pepper and a little oregano with the soup. I also used sour cream instead of milk. It was a very simple supper!

This was good, didn't have much flavor to it even though I added the Worchestershire, Garlic Salt and other seasonings. It reminded me of Hamburger Helper.

To be honest the tater tots were all mush at the bottom. It was all together a very strange texture. My kids ages 15 & 9 strongly disliked it.

i had looked at this recipe for about a week, wanting to make it, but not to sure.  this was really good and really easy! I made it for just 2 of us, so cut everything in half and since my BF is lactose intolerant, i just put the cheese on my half (pepper jack and cheddar).  the tater tots were nice and crispy like i like them and the BF said it was great.  thanks

It's been said already but I'll say it again - cut back on the milk.  I always like to follow the recipe exactly as written when I make it the first time.  Adding the amount of milk that this recipe calls for made it WAY to soupy.  To get rid of some of the juice, I had to use a slotted spoon to serve this.  It was a good, easy, family friendly recipe.  I'll definitely make it again... I'll just add less milk next time.

MMMmmmmm...Of course you have to tweak it a bit to your taste. I love to season the beef with chopped onion, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes. I used 1lb. of beef, added 1c. cheddar cheese to the meat mixture, and only half a cup milk. Also turned the broiler on for 2 more minutes at the end. Turned out great!

This was soooo good!!!! My boys loved it.  The only change I made was to add a handful of shredded cheese to the mixture before baking and some more to the top after it came out of the oven.  I'm glad I doubled it & made an extra pan or not me and the honey wouldn't have gotten any!!!!

Good recipe.  I also added worchestershire to the hamburger and put about 1/2 the milk in.  Turned out to be a very flavorful thick gravy that was great over the tater tots.

This is a great recipe only if instead of using a measuring cup for the 10.5 fluid oz. of milk, you use the cream of mushroom soup can for a can of milk, then you're set. Otherwise, it turns out really soupy. 

Also, I personally like to add a layer of about a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese before I add my layer of tater tots.

Delicious and easy. My husband loves this one. He says it has everything a man needs -- meat, potatoes, and cheese (I like to sprinkle some shredded cheddar or jack cheese on top). One note- When I first put it together, I thought there was way too much liquid, but during cooking it all came together.

When I said, "Tater Tot Casserole," my family went, "ick."  However, we all liked it.  Made it just like the recipe said except I layered cheese on half to see if I would like it better with or without.  I liked it without, my husband liked it with, and my kids liked it either way.  I'll make it the same way next time.  It was quick and easy!

This was super easy to make. We just added another child to our family and super easy meals are what I've been looking for. I did take an earlier suggestion and added a layer of cheese between the meat mixture and tater tots. I also browned the meat with some onions, some Dales seasoning and tabasco.My 3 year old loved this so it is a real keeper!

This one was pretty good.  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom but otherwise followed the recipe.  Husband wasn't too impressed but the kiddo had seconds which is important because it did contain green beans!

I liked this recipe but found it a little salty.  I have been eating/making tater tot casserole since I was a child and always loved it, but my mom made it with no seasonings and my husband found it bland when I started making it for him.  I like that this recipe uses only 1/2 lb of hamburger.  My mom's old recipe used a full pound and that is too much.  The garlic salt adds great flavor, but next time I will use 1/2 the garlic salt and 1/2 garlic powder to cut the saltiness.  I didn't see a need for the milk, I think it would make it too watery, so I left it out.  I included a good handful of shredded cheddar cheese and about a tablespoon of sour cream for extra flavor.  I also used only 1/2 can beans and I used yellow wax beans (chopped up) so the kids wouldn't notice the vegetables.  The color blends right in and they didn't even know they were eating beans in their casserole.  Thanks for the update to my old family recipe.  Kids really like this and it's great for the meat and potatoes husband.

This is one of those meals I can easily and quickly throw together and my family loves it.  I had a little bit more ground beef, an envelope of onion soup mix and some chopped onion to it and it's a hit at our house!

I made changes after reading other reviewer's suggestions:  I used more beef and less milk.  This was a good, but simple recipe that reminded us of a high school favorite.  Thanks Drew!

It was good and easy to make. We used mixed veggies instead and cooked cheese over top of it.

I'm rating this a 4 because we had to make changes, however we DO love it.  Adding that much milk was just too much for us...made it too soupy.  I added shredded cheese into the mixture until melted (I probably used about 1 cup of cheese).  I also use a pound of ground beef.  I like my tater tots crispier than this recipe makes them, so if I have time, I bake the tater tots by themselves for a bit before putting them on top of the meat mixture.  Otherwise, it is an easy and excellent recipe!

I didn't put as much milk in after I read other reviews and I put WAY more veggies in it.  Basically, whatever I needed to use up before it went bad, I cut up and put in the casserole.  My kids loved it!

I rate this a 5 because both of my girls liked it and finished it without a fuss!  I have a Tater Tot Casserole recipe already but couldn't find it and this seemed close to memory.  I did not add the green beans but made steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrot dish on the side.  I also added a half pound of ground turkey with the ground beef and seasoned it with garlic pepper and onion powder while it browned. In addition, I added about a half cup of shredded ched/jack cheese to the mix and then sprinkled a little more over top before placing the tots. I also prefer using Ore Ida Crispy Crowns as they are flatter and seem to crisp better.

I have been making something like this for years,  but i cook the tator tots while i'm browning the beef. i add garlic powder and seasoning salt to the meat. when tatortots are done i mix add the beef in a casserole dish with garlic alfredo sauce (instead of cream of mushroom), green beans, corn and tons of colby jack shredded cheese and mix it all up. i then put sliced cheese on top and stick it back in the oven until the cheese is melted

I thought this was really satisfying.  I sauteed some shallots in olive oil before adding in the beef.  I seasoned beef with S&P, garlic powder, and then stirred in only 1/2 cup milk, and the soup.  I used Campbells Low-Sodium Cream of Mushroom soup.  I used broccoli instead of green beans, and sprinkled extra sharp cheddar on top of the tots.  Yummy!

As far as the recipe goes, it turned out perfectly. My kids only thought it was ok and my husband and I just didn't really care for it. It was an quick and easy recipe to make. The flavor was alright. I think if I were to make soemthing like this again I would use mashed potatoes instead of tater tots and have a sort of shepards pie.

I put the tater tots on the bottom, cooked at 400 for 20 minutes and take out of oven and mashed down to form a shell.  Add ground beef, layer broccoli or any vegetable add cheese and top with durkey's.  Bake for 30 min at 350.

Instead of green beans I used broccoli/cauliflower mix.  Also replaced ground beef with ground bear.  This is an awesome recipe to use ground wild game.

I love tater tot casserole and my family loved it too. I definetly suggest adding cheddar cheese to this recipe. I used a full pound of ground beef, seasoned with half a packet of dry onion soup mix, seasoning salt and worchestire sauce. Then I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of milk, and a dollap of sour cream.  It was so good I can't wait to make it again.  I may start making it once a week until we get tired of it (or we gain 50 pounds...)

This is so easy and really good. I put the oven on broil at the end because I like the tater tots crispy. I have made this meal for two friends that are sick and have kids. Its a great meal for families with kids.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit!  I omitted the ground beef because i was making this as a side dish for chicken.  I sauteed an onion & some garlic(i like the real thing no powder for me) and added another can of cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic.

This recipe didn't have much flavor.  It called for WAY TOO MUCH milk, and it was just missing something.  And I even added some cheese and that still didn't do it.  Hubby thought it was good with some ketchup.

This was good but i think it was pretty runny, maybe adding some flour would do the trick or maybe not so much milk next time, but even my picky non vegitable eater loved it!!! Thanks!

A great weeknight meal for working moms. My daughter (six years old) loved it. I liked it and will definitely make again.

I was skeptical, but wanted something one-dish and different.  It came out pretty good!  I used the low sodium cream of mushroom soup as the only liquid and thawed frozen green beans and a small can of mushrooms. My husband liked it, and I will make it again one day!

Without the changes I made this would have been extremely bland.  I doubled the recipe to make a 9 x 13 pan sized casserole.  After I browned the ground beef I seasoned it with Montreal steak seasoning and a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I used cream of potato soup instead of mushroom.  I only used approx. 8 fluid ounces of milk for the doubled recipe.  MAKE SURE YOU DRAIN THE GREEN BEANS!!  I omitted the garlic salt.  I layered the meat mixture, then a layer of cheddar cheese, then a layer of french fried onions, and then the tator tots.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream.

It was alright. I made it because I thought my kids would like it. Maybe we dont eat this kind of food often enough though because they did not care for. I will not make it again.

My boyfriend is from the midwest and begged me to make him a hotdish!  I'd never heard of it before, but he loved this recipe.  Apparently, it's very authentic.  Reducing the amount of milk and seasoning the meat like crazy are necessary changes, though.  I added sauteed onion to the meat and lots of pepper and worchester.  It's a crowd pleaser, none-the-less.

Good.  A bit too much sauce.  Definitely cut down on the milk.  I used canned mixed vegetables in place of the green beans.  It's just super cheap comfort food, so if you're looking for something amazing, move on.

Though this is EXACTLY what tater tot hotdish is supposed to be like (I grew up in MN in the 60's,) I had forgotten how dull the flavor is.  This dish is great for picky kids/adults with an "EEEEUW!  Everything is too spicy!"-palate; your strictly meat-n-potatoes fan.  But for those of us that enjoy complex flavors but also love love love the idea of comfort food (it's ease to make, how it fills our tummies, and the memories!) there must be updated comfort dishes that offer the palate a little more excitement.  I used organic tots and beans, but used Healthy Request Campbell's soup for authenticity.

I ended up putting all the frozen tater tots on the bottom and covering with the ground beef mixture.  Totally worked out.  My picky toddler loves it!  I'm a happy mom.  Next time, I'll put in more green beans and jullienned carrots as a way to keep the veggies going into the kids.

Quick and easy to prepare - I would definitely spice it up - I added the worchestershire sauce and the salt (as well as lots of pepper).  I used a "healthy" version of the soup and half the milk - worked just fine!

Ok so now I know to read all reviews before making a recipe.  We had soup, but really good tasting soup!  Next time I'll for sure reduce the milk and try some of the other tips as well.

I added montreal steak seasoning to the hamburger and some worchestire sauce. I added mushrooms and layered velveeta cheese on top of the soup mix before adding the tots. Everyone loved it! including two picky toddlers.

I am pregnant and was craving some version of this casserole.  I took the basic recipe and doubled it.  To give it flavor, I added about 1 cup of onion to the hamburger as I was browning it and used one can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic along with one can of regular cream of mushroom soup.  The only other change I made was that I used 1 can of green beans and one can of carrots.  It turned out pretty well...exactly the homey taste that  I was looking for...reminded me of my childhood...but with a little more flavor.

This recipe was great.  I did take some advice from the reviews and added less milk.  Everybody in my family loved it, and it took minutes to make.  I made a  salad and crusty bread for the sides, I had no leftovers.  Will definetly make again!

Wonderful for picky boys!  I left out the green beans for nothing green goes into his mouth! Instead of the skim milk I used Cream of Chicken Soup and some cheese.  It's easy and fast.

I made this last night and everyone thought it was okay. I seasoned the beef and used 2/3 cup milk. I also used cream of chicken because it was all I had. Maybe that is why it didn't come out so well.

This is a great base recipe!  My changes: cream of chicken (didn't have mushroom), 1 can 8 oz. mushroom  pieces, reg. green beans, garlic and shallots, chopped, and red pepper, chopped, salt (no garlic salt) and pepper, Worcestershire, hot pepper flakes, topped with crushed chips.  I cooked the tater tots in air fryer to crisp before adding to casserole-yum!

Trying to recreate somebody else's childhood memory, I started here, doubled the recipe pretty much, and used others' advise.  I used two pounds of ground beef, 32 ounces frozen green beans, onions, garlic powder and Worcestershire browned in, cheddar jack cheese in the mix, and a large can of cream of mushroom, and milk to texture.  Then I put the goop in a standard sheetcake pan plus our Pyrex 8x8, and layered on more cheese, French's fried onions, and a 32ounce package of tater tots. We have a Mixed generation family of seven;  I will note how it goes!  TK said it was the stuff!  Teenagers were not fans.  I thought it had a nice buttery finish, but you could barely tell that I drained the beef and onions in the colander!

Easy to make and my picky little girl adored it!  We added shredded cheese to it and it was amazing!

Kids placed this second to poppyseed chicken which is a family favorite - I added shredded cheddar cheese, some on top of each layer of tater tots and burger mix.  It was awesome and so easy!

This is my husband's signature dish, although he layers the ingredients like a lasagna and adds stewed tomatoes and not as much milk. I'm sure he mixes the soup, milk and stewed tomato juice before the layering part as I've never actually watched him make this. Tastes good though.

The recipe I use is just about the same It came to me via my youngest son from the college and  his apartment days. It is close other than add the diced onion with ground beef and use the regular cut green beans instead of the french cut, I usually make a fair amount so just eyeball it to add more ground beef and other ingredients to the original recipe. My form of cooking guess at it after you make it a couple of times don't do much measuring except with things like cakes and what your family likes.

Use your imagination on this one. Fresh mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, garlic and cheese is a must. A bit of soy sauce adds lots of yumminess. Maybe some jalapenos.

Everyone liked this. I forgot to add the garlic salt while I was mixing it up, so I ended up sprinkiling it on top after it was in the oven, but it was still so good.

Made exactly as specified, except I substituted ground venison hamburger.  It was delicious and masked the sometimes gamey taste of the deer.  Delicious!  There's a second one in the freezer for future meals!

I have to give this 3 stars because there really is something missing from it. I grew up eating tator tot casserole and this just isn't the same. I'm not sure what is missing but I'm going to find out and find another recipe. This is good but not to my tastes really.

Tater tot casserole in itself is a comical dish. The fact that is appeals to so many toddlers should tell us something. It's kind of like spaghetti-o's - we love them and devour them as a kid and when we grow up they're still fairly tolerable. This was just how I remembered tater tot casserole and we had a good laugh eating it. It was fun.

made per recipe is good but try using chicken breast cut up and browned with some sliced mushrooms.  I put some cheese on top the last few minutes to melt. fresh shredded parmesan is yummy.
try it some time.

Perfect weeknight meal when you want to pop something in the oven and not worry about it for a while. I like to add a little worcestershire sauce when browning the meat.

added 3/4 can of milk, more veggies and loads of 4S (Penzy's season salt) and Worstershire sauce. Definately season to your taste before baking in the oven to avoid being dissapointed in 'blandness'. 
I wouldn't add cheese even though my husband runs a cheese factory!

Bland and an unusual mix, even after adding the suggested spices to the ground beef and reducing the milk.  Would have been better off just having a good ole hamburger, green beans, and tater tots separately rather than all together.  My husband said it was more like a "elementary school cafeteria meal."  I guess it is a way to sneak in veggies for kids.

I nearly died when Husband requested a Tater Tot Casserole! But anyway, I combined this recipe with Tater Tot Casserole II from this site with something Husband's colleague described. Basically, I browned the ground beef in a skillet, added half a chopped onion and sauteed it with the meat, and stirred in the soup and milk. I then folded in a couple of cups of mixed veggies (defrosted from a bag), seasoned it with ground pepper and garlic salt, then threw it in a baking dish, and topped it with tater tots. Twenty mins in the oven at 350, then I topped it with extra-sharp Cheddar, and baked for 5 or so mins. I did not like it at all, but Husband enjoyed it. And I guess that's what counts!

I increased beef to 1 lb, used cream of asparagus instead of mushroom, cut milk to 1/2c.  Sauteed onion and garlic with the beef, didn't use garlic salt, added Lawry's and tons of paprika.  Also followed another recommendation and added shredded cheddar on top of the beef and under the tots.  I guess I didn't really cook this recipe - but it was good!

Way too much milk.  Please note, this recipe uses the same amount of milk as you would to make the cream of mushroom soup.  I would decrease the amount of milk by at least half.  Wondered about it before making it, but went for it.  Ended up with a puddle.  Would have been good otherwise, I believe.
