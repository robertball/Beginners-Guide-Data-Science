Love the flavors, but the chicken needs to cook longer. I cooked the chicken almost two hours before I removed it and cut it up.  I also made a few other changes - grocery store didn't have kohlrabi or parsnips, so I increased the carrots and potatoes and added a cut up turnip. I also didn't add the bouillon granules, but since I cooked the chicken longer, I didn't need the extra chicken flavor boost.  I added a bag of kluski noodles at the same time I added the cut up chicken, and it turned out really well.  With some good crusty bread, this makes a great comfort food meal.  Giving it only three stars because of the problem with the initial cooking time, otherwise would be a solid a high four.

Perfect as-is... I can't imagine cooking the chicken for 2 hours unless you like chicken mush. This was wonderful and needs no tweaking. Thanks for sharing!

I make this recipe every year for a dinner course after the Pesach Seder. My family and community love this recipe. As stated above I add matzo balls at the end to add to the festival meal! Chag Samaech!

I made this in response to a challenge to try vegetables i hadn't tried before. Might have tried kohlrabi in another soup once, but still unfamiliar, and dont think I've ever used parsnips. Was a little surprised the recipe didn't call for garlic, but resisted the urge to add. This recipe is still the best chicken soup I've ever made. Will probably add garlic next time just because I like garlic, but would consider it as optional.

Fantastic! I always try to follow the recipe the first time I make something, especially when it contains ingredients I rarely use. However, I did make the chicken in an instant pot, and used the stock to instant pot the soup. I added in the onions with stock, and the herbs at the very end with the reserved chicken. Very interesting and so good I shared some with my neighbors on a cold windy day.

My family loves this recipe. The first time I made it exactly as instructed and it was great. The second time I left out the parsnips only because my daughter and I don’t like them. This was the first time I’ve had kohlrabi cooked and I really enjoyed it. I now use this as my base for classic chicken noodle soup as well, I just swap the potatoes and kohlrabi for homemade noodles. Thanks for sharing this recipe; it’s fantastic.

Yes I altered the recipe but this was the first time I used dill weed to chicken soup "we loved it" what a difference it made. Thank you for a little change in my tummy!

This is probably one of the best chicken soups I have ever made!  My friends and family all loved it too.  I added onion powder instead of onions. So very good!

Best chicken soup recipe I've found.  

I do cheat by not including potatoes, kohlrabi & parsnips.  And I use Progreso unsalted chicken stock in lieu of water & Hungarian paprika in lieu of pepper.  

Before Jennifer's step  1, I soften 3 or 4 cloves of garlic (sliced thinly) & half a vidalia or other sweet onion (chopped)  in olive oil & white wine .

I make enough to last 2 people for 3 or 4 days & it gets better each day.
