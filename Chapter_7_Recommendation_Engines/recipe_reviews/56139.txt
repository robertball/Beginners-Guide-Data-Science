Although you might like the healthy version, you must try the recipe as it is first!... That is my rule of thumb. All rice is different and is not as starchy or as absorbable as the rest! I can soak up 6 cups of milk with 1 cup of reg med grain rice..Brown rice takes longer to asborb liquid than thw white rices...Cooking is a chemistry, you have to know what your doing before u start changing things, plus have the experience in doin so. From a professinal cook and chef yours truly George

First of all, I'm a big fan of both pumpkin pie and rice pudding.  I don't think this tastes like pumpkin pie and I didn't love the pudding.  I made it exactly as written(4 cups of milk is not too much when using the right rice), but something in the pumpkin layer seemed off. I think it could have used more sugar and spices.  I would taste the pumpkin half before baking it, and add whatever you think it needs.

This is pretty tastey.  I am a huge fan of rice pudding and since I have an abundance of pumpkin in my freezer I was searching for a use for it.  Followed the recipe except used a heaping tsp of pumpkin spice instead of the individual spices.  Also increased the sugar to 1/2c.  After simmering in the milk for 20mins it was still really soupy so I decided to just mix in the puree and not layer.  Cooked for 60 mins, stirring every 20mins and it came out beautiful.

I used soymilk instead of moo milk, and honey instead of sugar. It turned out really well! I did feel like it was missing something so I added more cinnamon and that helped. My 18 mos. old and I enjoyed it very much!

a good way to have nutrition and sweetness in a dessert. I would increase the sugar a bit...good flavor overall.  I used leftover brown rice.

This was very tasty. My family was doing a vegan type diet for a few weeks and this definitely helped with the sweet cravings.

I used brown rice for this recipe and it seemed like the recipe called for way too much water and too much milk because the rice didn't come close to absorbing all the liquid.  I drained out a lot of milk.  However it still came out pretty good.  I wouldn't say it was amazing but it is editable.

I think this recipe could have used a little more sugar. That having been said, I ended up with a lot of it after Thanksgiving and had it for breakfast every day with a little half & half poured over top until I finished it. I love pudding any way I can get it.

We skipped the water and cooked the rice in rice milk, adding rice milk again later. Also substituted agave for the sugar. We all enjoyed this - but by itself made us think of it as more of a breakfast porridge rather than a dessert. Topping of ice cream or whipping cream was a nice add.

I was so excited to try this.  I love rice pudding and I love pumpkin anything, but this was neither pumpkin spiced enough to remind me of pie nor sweet creamy enough to remind me of rice pudding.

It was good, but as others have said, it might be missing something. Dad suggested brown sugar and a little bit of clove spice. I think I'd use 1/2 c brown sugar instead of 1/3c white sugar, if I make it again. I used Kouho Rose rice and whole milk instead of arborio rice and skim milk, just because that's what I had on hand. It was very creamy. I don't quite understand why there are 2 levels of rice pudding. I think the raisins would do fine cooking in the pumpkin. Who knows? It was strange, but my mouth was dry after eating it. It was an unexpected effect...

Delicious twist on plain old rice pudding.  It was a hit with my family.
