Excellent! There isn't any seasoning which allows the flavour of the shrimp to shine. I cut the recipe back to 1 portion, I'm the only one that will eat shrimp that isn't grilled. I used unsalted crackers and shrimp that were 13/20, the cooking time is perfect for this size. The oil was heated until it shimmered but wasn't smoking. I served this over a bed of caesar salad for a complete meal. When I make this again I will leave the tails on for a better presentation. Thanks for sharing your Nan's recipe.

Love this recipe but i added a tsp of tony chacheres to the flour and i used ritz crackers in place of the saltines, oh and i almost forgot i also marinated the shrimp in some Louisiana hot sauce. Poof! They were gone in minutes.

Great simple recipe. I agree that leaving the tails on would be better. Step 1 of the recipe should be clarified to say - butterfly the shrimp - unless for some reason you bought whole shrimp with the heads still attached.
