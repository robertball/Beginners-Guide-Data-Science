I thought this was very tastey, was able to use decaf coffee for the kids, you could add caramel or chocolate syrup to give it a different taste when needed, or leave as is, great treat on a hot summers day!. Thanks Lucy for the recipe. BTW used crushed ice, if you are able to.... will blend nicer.

Tastes amazing, and it was very easy. My only problem was that when i scaled the recepie to 1, it only made about 4 ounces.

Cutting this back to one helping was tricky. I used one heaping scoop homemade frozen vanilla yogurt, 1/4 cup nonfat milk and one Starbucks VIA packet. Honestly, I think I'd like this better without the ice. Not bad. I'd make this again but I think I would play with the recipe a little more.

This recipe tasted great, but I had to change around the amounts of each ingredient a bit. I added less ice and more ice cream, and definitely more coffee granuales, but it was great!

tastes great, but blending ice can sometimes be a pain if you don't have a nice blender.

I made this with a pot of perculator coffee that had been brewed but forgotten about. Husband added a little Splenda, but I thought it was perfect. Thanks, Lucy!

Tastes fantastic!  I added a little bit of chocolate syrup.  You may want to double the ingredients, the original recipe only makes 2 small glasses!

Well, it's winter now, but this was still pretty tasty, and easy to make. I'll probably make it often. Thanks!

I used non-fat frozen yogurt and espresso powder instead of instant coffee, then added just a drizzle of chocolate syrup.  I actually got two "servings" out of this, using tall glasses.  Delicious!

I am not sure why but this drink had a really strong coffee flavor for the little amount of instant coffee in it. I think I would rather have had a measured amount of ice cream, because a scoop of ice cream can mean different things to different people. As a result, I ended up with 2 servings instead of the suggested 4. It may have also been why mine was stronger. I did use 1/2 the fat ice cream, as I usually do, and had no problem with that. Although, I have a good quality blender and had a little difficulty getting it to blend. I had to stop and stir a few times to get the ice to break up. Besides that, it was nice and cooling on a hot day. Overall, though, it just seemed like something was missing. Maybe, a packet of sweetener or a spoon of chocolate syrup, not sure.
