This is delicious and addicting. My son has asked for this "at least once a week".  I reduce the brown sugar & ketchup to 1/3 cup each, otherwise it is a little too sweet.  I also leave out the onion and the vinegar. We love it with Doritos or corn chips. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted shredded cheddar cheese for the slices of American.  I thought this was absolutely delicious.  My husband thought it was very good, but a little too sweet (maybe next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar or not pack it down as much.)  The crunchy tortilla chips on top made a good contrast to the beef and bean mixture--I think I'll add an extra 1/2 c. next time.  Overall, it was a great recipe considering how easy it was to put together.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe - SO many beans! I'm glad I made it though because it is SO good! The mustard/ketchup flavor works so well with the beans, and the crunchy topping is a wonderful contrast. My only changes were to add a little garlic powder, a splash of hot sauce, and I used extra-sharp Cheddar cheese. Thanks so much, Angela! (By the way, I halved the recipe, and there was still probably 4 or 5 servings!)

The recipe was really easy to make and very straight forward. The outcome is very tasty and just-a-little-sweet chilli. Aproved!

Very very good!  Family all agree this one is a keeper.  Made no changes, great as it is.    UPDATE: Made this again using leftover baked ham instead of bacon, a splash of liquid smoke, and a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Good recipe as written, but just as good with my minor changes.  Great recipe on it's own, but easy to make your own.

My three picky kiddos ate this up and loved every bite! I did as some other reviewers suggested and reduced the brown sugar and ketchup to 1/3 cup and it was still a little on the sweet side. Very delicious though and this one is definitely a keeper in our house!

It was an OK dish. I thought my kids would love it, but they didn't touch it! My husband like it. It would be a good potluck recipe. I did have all the ingredients on hand, that was a plus.

We love things with beans and so we reallyloved this recipe. It was very, very easy and a great recipe for a quiet evening watching TV. I used Doritos on top and it was fine. Wouldn't change a thing! Have a nice salad with it and you've got a well rounded meal.

I really liked this.  At first I thought it was oing to have too many beans and not enough beef, but it worked out really well.  If I were to do it again, I would just use chili beans and mayb not quite as much, and would use more cheese (my bf's request).

I left out the green peppers and will cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup next time I make it.  We have four children who are picky eaters and this went over very well.

this was a good recipe. kind of a baked bean,tacoy,chilliy taste, all wrapped up into one. my whole family liked it. one change i would make though, is not to put the crushed chips on top and prob. to grate the cheese. we used it mainly as a dip and scoop with the tortillia chips. my husb. would rather have corn chips so next time i think i'll offer a few of diff. kinds with it. very good, thank u.

This recipe saved my life!! Well, not really but I was surprised when my husn+band called and said that he's bringing along a couple pf his colleagues to lunch and I had no idea what to prepare. It was a wonderful recipe, I substituted the American cheese for red cheddar and the tortilla chips for cheese ond onion crisps, and alotta mozzarella. The guests loved it with a green salad and mashed potatoes.

I am not a bean eater, so I did not try this recipe.     My husband thought it was good.  He also said that the taste was very similar to chili, like another reviewer.  I substituted cheddar for the american cheese, and ommited the green papeer.  My husband said that the only thing he would change was to reduce the amount of the pork 'n beans.  Thanks for the post.

A hit.  My husband really liked it.  I omitted the bell peppers and onions due to personal preference.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the american cheese slices.  Next time I will use more totrtilla chips!

This is an excellent recipe. I wasn't sure I would care for it myself but I knew the others in the house would like it. Turned out I liked it too. It looked dry but was not. Not sure what was ment by Chili Beans, as I have always used Kidney beans in chili so I used a can of black beans.

This was a great croud pleaser.  One person said it was very rick and she couldn't eat a lot of it; I would say she liked it.  I like it for leftovers to take to work for lunch, too.  Very good recipe!
