I made these for my family in hopes they would gobble them up..especially since my little guy is fond of cheese, but these were not well recieved.  I ended up eating most of them because I hated to see them go to waste.  Mine were really crumbly and didn't stay together too well. I did like the taste and texture, but probably won't attempt these again unless I have a specific request. I have found other recipes with similar ingredients that sound promising.  Maybe I'll give them a shot as well.  Thanks anyway.

I added some spices to mine---paprika, and a little parmesan cheese. I also added a few tablespoons of water and a little more flour. We rolled them out like snakes. Also, I think the ratio of flour to cheese is off in this recipe, so I added a little more cheese. I think the secret here is to make a workable dough. If your dough is not workable, add more flour, or if its too dry, add a sprinkling of water. A little baking powder helps them not be so flat.

i just made these, and the dough is hard to work with. i plan to try again, and handle the dough differently. i would suggest really working and mixing the dough by hand, then sticking in the fridge for a few minutes, because i had some straws turn out good, and some just melt on the cookie sheet. then after forming the balls i suggest sticking then in the fridge again for about 15-20 minutes to make it easier to roll the straws. also, i used parchment to line my cookie sheet, and i'm glad i did. i also used a spicey cheddarjack cheese for a little kick. these would be great with some sort of dipping sauce, maybe ranch with when using a spicey cheese, or a marinara when using a parmesan or mozzerela cheese. good recipe, just takes some practice i think.

These are great! I added an extra tablespoon or two of butter to make them stick together better. They look like long strips of melted cheese, which is not what I was thinking they would be (maybe the extra butter affected it??), but they were so delicious that I didn't care. Completely worth the trouble!

Not sure if I did something wrong but these were inedible! No one liked them. They tasted like pie crust - too floury. Sorry but I won't be making these again.

The flavor is really good!! But I also couldn't roll these into snakes or even balls. I put the mix into the bottom of a baking dish about 1/4 inch deep until crisp and cut into squares.

I tried refrigerating the dough, that didn't help. I could not work withthe dough at all.  So I thought, I'll just try rolling into thin snakes, and cooking them that way.  They melted to my baking sheet.  I had like a sheet of cheese covering the pan.  I think maybe more flour.....dunno.  I won't be trying these again, I just don't have the patience.

Quite nice not the kind of thing for people who aren't big on cheese as the taste is very over powering. If your not big on cheese you could of corse use less cheese or use a mild flavord one.

I really wanted to love these but the end product wasn't what I expected.  They didn't hold their shape. The straws were definitely cheesy but the flavor all in all was very bland.  I don't see myself making these again.

Didn't work for me even after adding more flour, butter and a little water. Way too much cheese, too little of other ingredients.

Is there an ingredient missing?  Did not rise, cheese started to burn at 6 min.  Tasted like cheese and flour. I did not care for this recipe.

I made these last night and was very pleased with the simplicity of the ingredients and the taste of the straws.  They didn't look like straws when they baked cause they puffed out but they look fine and taste great!  I am saving most of them in the freezer for a famiy get together I am having at my house on Sunday.  I know my mom and dad will love the cheese straws!  Thanks for the recipe!

The straws were very tasty, but really greasy.  Also, I may have done something wrong, but I just could not get the dough to form into straws.  I had a hard enough time making a ball with it.  Perhaps cut back on the butter and add some water.

Made these last night for my two grandsons, ages 8 & 11.  They could live off cheese if you'd let them. This was a tremendous hit with them. I have a feeling we will be making a lot of these until the new wears off. Great recipe!!

These had great taste and texture but the reason for only four stars is that I could not get the ingredients to come together where I could form a ball, let a lone a "snake".  So I added about 1/3 c of soya margarine to the mix and it came together perfectly.  I also added about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard for some extra flavour.   Everyone enjoyed them very much.   I will make this again but probably use half and half margarine from the start.

These were so easy to make and delicious.  The only substitutions I made was 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour plus a tablespoon of wheatgerm (I try to fit that in wherever I can in recipes).

pretty good flavor, of course if it has cheese I'm happy ;) the dough was hard to roll out and spread during baking...certainly not "straws" I made a double batch and will be pressing the rest of the dough into a baking dish to cut into strips...

The first time I made these, they spread all over the cookie sheet. The next time I had better success because I rolled the cheese mixture into a couple sheets of phyllo dough. I also added oregano for extra flavor. They were very tasty and crispy too. Will try again.

These taste exactly like dry cheese crackers!  My daughter loved them, but the rest of us didn't care for them at all.

These were good.  I will definitely use a dry pastry blender next time to ensure thorough mixing.
