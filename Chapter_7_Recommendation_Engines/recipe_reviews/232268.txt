Very nice recipe.  I cooked a meaty ham bone from the freezer in the crockpot overnight and used the broth from that in place of the water and chicken bouillon. I kind of reserved the method. I cooked the potatoes in the ham broth in a large sauce pan. I cooked the onion, celery, garlic and carrot (not called for in the recipe) in the butter.  Added the flour and made a roux using 2 cups low fat milk.  I added the seasonings to the roux / milk mixture.  Once the potatoes were done I dumped them and the broth into the large pot and added the ham from the ham bone and the corn.   If you like larger pieces of potato in your soup leave it as it.  If you like a smoother more creamy soup, use a potato masher to smash up the potatoes and broth before adding the the creamy vegetable mixture.  The white pepper gives the a very tasty finish.  If you are sensitive to pepper cut the white pepper back to 1/2 tsp.   I garnished the soup with a little grated cheese and diced chives.  Served with a crusty bread it made for a wonderful dinner.  Thanks for a good recipe, Cara.

Great soup for a cold winter supper. Chose this recipe over others on the site because of the cauliflower and when I went to the grocery store they were sold out of cauliflower!  Since the soup was short a vegetable, I added diced carrots.  Omitted the salt, reduced the garlic to one clove, added sliced scallions, and minced fresh parsley.  Think it would be even better with the cauliflower.  Good with or without shredded cheddar cheese on top.

My boyfriend and I really enjoy cooking and this was such a fun, easy meal to prepare together. Since the holiday season was recently upon us, there has been an over abundance of HAM in both our families dinners. I hate to be wasteful, so I started off my day with a traditional English brekkie of Bubble and Squeak (which I highly recommend to anyone that has leftover veggies from a roast) and then this delicious meal for dinner. I actually added a bit more flour to the milk mixture because I enjoy thick, hearty soups. We topped off our bowls with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and green onions. This was a fantastic recipe we will definitely use again. Thank you!

This was great and went over well during a football game party. Minor changes..I doubled the recipe and sauteed all of the vegys (except corn and potatoes) until tender and then used an immersion blender to puree half of the vegys once it cooked in the liquid for a while (potatoes cooked through) and only used half the butter. Super good and easy!

I'm rating this off the original recipe, but including my additions which were minor.  This was really good. I did use chicken broth in place of the water as others have done.  The only other thing I did differently, because the ingredients seemed kind of bland, is I added a 1/2 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of sage and a 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  Don't really think those amounted to much. After the soup was made and I had a small bowl to taste and review, I then added a box of gnocchi. I ate almost 3 bowls in one sitting! I then had a bowl for breakfast the next day! Yummy.

Sautéed veggies (onion, garlic, celery, carrots) in butter, added cauliflower and potatoes with 32 oz of chicken broth and let it cook for about 30-45 minutes.  Used immersion blender.  Added ham and bacon bits with 2 cups of half and half, and let simmer until someone yelled for supper.  No need for flour to thicken.  Forgot the corn.  Added the cheese and more bacon bits to individual servings.  (Immersion blender disguises veggies so my teenaged son will eat it.)   Moving this to favorites.

Delicious--this is very similar to another recipe Delicious Ham and Potato Soup except for the addition of the cauliflower and corn.  I didn't try the cauliflower as I didn't have any. I have used the other recipe on this site and it too is delicious--I loved the corn addition and will use it in the future. Don't know if I'll try the cauliflower as I think it may overpower the taste.

I couldn't believe that a recipe so simple would produce such a great tasting soup! Everyone loves this. I subbed carrots for the corn but otherwise made as directed. This tastes like my grandmas ham soup that she'd spend all day making but this is quick enough to make after work and tastes like a rich, slow cooked soup.

Delicious.  Made a couple of small changes.  I used smoked sausage instead of ham.  If you want a richer broth, use 1/2 c of heavy cream and 1 1/2 c of milk.  Great on a cold winter night!!

We loved it. I made a little extra overall, but failed to cook enough potatoes, It was slightly too soupy. Also, I discovered no froz corn, just creamed corn, or, fresh corn. So I added 2 cobs of corn (with corn sliced off the cob), to the rest of the vege's. Before I added the roux to the vege's, I added both cans I had of creamed corn. When mixed, poured it into the vege pot. Worked well. My partner loved it.

I added less potatoes and more cauliflower. And when I made the roux, I added both shredded cheese and processed cheese to make it into cheese soup. Very good. Reheated very well.

Easy and delicious it is!  Even the little ones have asked that we have it again for supper.  I  doubled the potatoes and ham, and  added 1 cup more broth.  Didn't have cauliflower to add, but we didn't miss it.

I sampled it as written and then added some shredded cheddar cheese.  My son and I both liked it but I reserve 5 stars for "tested best" designations.

My partner liked it a bit more than I did. Both thought too much pepper - I'll cut amount in half if I make again. Substituted broccili for cauliflower, and used a sweet potato as part of potato amount.

Used all chicken broth vs plain water. Left out cauliflower but added carrots as that’s what was on hand. Before adding to the potatoes and broth, I sautéed the onion, carrots, and some celery in butter til the onion was clear as I prefer the taste of the onion when slightly cooked than when added raw - it’s a milder flavor in my opinion (and I like onions!) Put in double (maybe triple?) the called for amounts of both corn and ham as I was wanting a ham and corn chowder — the result is just perfect! Super happy and will make this again for sure....

This is a great recipe! I did increase all of the vegetables and ham a bit. I had to use an extra cup of water as a result. I had no granules so I pulled out a bit if the hot water and put it into a ramekin with 2 bouillon cubes and crushed them before adding it back into the soup. I also had no flour so I used corn starch. Everything turned out great! It was very easy, too!

This was wonderful! I added carrots and cauliflower as well and it was so delicious. Will make this whenever I have leftover ham.

We did this and my family loved it.  I substituted Almond milk for the regular milk, so it was dairy free.  Everyone enjoyed this soup!!!

I followed the recipe other than maybe more ham just because I had it leftover from Christmas dinner.  My husband said this is now his favorite soup ever!  I, too, loved it.  Will be make many times.

The family loved it!  I added more ham than it called for but otherwise I did not change the recipe. This is a keeper. I will make it again!

I admit I did screw this up with too much liquid. I tried doubling the batch because with such a small amount of water (or broth) it didn't seem like it would make much. So I ended up with too much liquid that diluted the flavor.
However, even though I made that mistake I still thought it was too bland and I even added more to it then what was called for. Seasoned salt, thyme, smoked paprika etc. It was still bland.
I won't make it again.

Probably would have liked more if had not taken some shortcuts in preparing. Did not make the roux or use milk so was not as creamy-- next time will take the time to do so. Used chicken broth instead of chicken granules and water. Did not have cauliflower so substituted carrots, thought the white pepper could have been decreased . Liked well enough, but will try to follow recipe next time.

Really delicious.  I had all the ingredients on hand and was so glad to use them up in this recipe.  I was delighted how all the flavors came together in this dish.  The addition of the cauliflower was a highlight.  Loved how easy it was too!

Delicious!!  Subbed carrots for celery and doubled everything except the butter/flour/milk mixture.  A new favorite!  Great use of leftover Christmas ham.  Thanks for sharing!

This is easy and delicious, and the entire family raved about it.  I will definitely be making this again, but will have to increase the portions because we had NO leftovers.
