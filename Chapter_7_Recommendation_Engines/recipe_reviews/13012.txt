too much soy sauce in the recipe - I'd half it!

Mmmmmmm, yummy!  I double the garlic powder and cumin and add a little extra soy sauce to give it more flavor.  And it is also great served over tabouli!

Great tasting soup! Good flavor.  I made it according to directions and wouldn't change any of the spices.  Although, I cooked it one day and ate it the next.  I think this helped the spices become bolder.  Next time, I will reserve some of the soup and not puree it to give it a little chunky texture.  Will make it again!

This soup smells wonderful while cooking, but is lacking in flavor.  With all the spices used, I was expecting this soup to be very flavorful.  It was just too bland for my taste.

I had to go with what was already in my kitchen - I left out the celery, cumin, soy sauce, curry powder and potato flakes, and used yams instead of potoatos.  Added some cilantro, and it turned out great.

I would give this 3.5 stars.  It was good for what it was; a low cal low fat soup made in a relatively short amount of time.  Changes I made:  Cut it in half (this made two servings for my husband and I), used chicken broth instead of water, sauteed the onion along with fresh garlic (omitted the garlic powder) in a bit of olive oil,  used a touch of skim milk instead of whole milk, left out the potato flakes, and increased the potato.
