Loved it! We're cilantro fans as opposed to parsley for most dishes.
Read carefully if you scale down the measurements to 4 servings though: the 3-pound fillet does not scale to the 1 1/2 pound; same with the divided butter and time for baking. I baked the 1 1/2 pound filet for 18 minutes and it was moist and perfect.
The second time I made this for 4 people, I actually kept the 8-serving amounts for the herb topping and used it on an asparagus casserole, treating it just the same way. First I parboiled the veggie, then stuck it in with the fish on the bottom rack. Once I took out the fish, I turned the oven to broil and toasted up the topping on the veggie. Nice accompaniment.

I would give this 6 stars if I could.  I enjoy eating salmon at least once a week.  This is a great way to make it. Very tasty and oh so easy. I used Panko for the bread crumbs, extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and broiled for a few minutes after baking for some crunch.  This is some recipe.  Thank you so much.  I don't think I will make salmon any other way now!

This recipe was great and easy.  One of 
the few fish dishes my entire family loved. I used lemon juice instead of zest
and halfed the breadcrumbs just for personal taste.  Still was delicious

This recipe was phenomenal. I used lemon and lime juice as others suggested. The bread crumb topping was so good I found myself nibbling the remains from the baking dish while I was doing the washing up. Preparation was quick and no-fuss and the results were spectacular, even for a beginning cook like me. I'll be making this again soon.

This recipe was very good. I used lime as well as the lemon...and after the salmon was cooked, I sprayed some lime and lemon juice on it and served immediately.

Excellent dish

Yummy!!  This tastes great.  I used a white fish filet instead of Salmon and it turned our great. I'm not a big fan of the taste of Thyme, so I omitted it.  It was very delicious.  I also broiled it for a few minutes at the end for a crispier texture.

This is absolutely delicious! However, I completely took out the Breadcrumbs and used olive oil instead of butter, but it was still just as good :). Also I added brocolli, zuchinni, and yellow squash around the baking dish.

this was so amazing.  I hardly ever cook fish I'm always so confused as to what to do with it.  But this was so good.  I'm adding this to a regular for meals.  Simple enough to make whenever, but fancy enough to make for dinner parties.  I might even try the topping on chicken as well.

After reading the reviews, I cut all the ingredients for the crumb mixture by half - and even then had loads of crumbs (enough that I froze the leftovers to use for another meal). I used Panko crumbs - worked really well, and doubled the lemon peel. Thanks for the recipe, Perlene.

This is a keeper. Used a mixture of Lemon and Lime inplace of the zest, and a little less bread crumbs. Hope this helps.

I'm not a big fish eater, but this was great. I had to adjust some of the ingredients since I had a smaller fillet and I tweeked some of the seasonings to what we had and liked. My fiance loved it and told me add it to the list!

Both the 16-month-old and the adults loved this. Will make again!

I didn't have all the items on hand, so substituted with what I had, and it still came out great. I used about two tsps. of lemon juice since I didn't have lemon peel. Used parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley. Used Italian instead of plain bread crumbs. I agree with the person who said the fresh thyme really makes this dish, though. I had that, and it made it so flavorful!

We love salmon and like to try it in new ways.  Unfortunately, the bread crumbs totally overwhelmed the salmon flavor.  Cut the bread crumbs way back or don't even use them and this is a nice flavor the salmon.

I used this recipe with white fish. It was healthy, simple, and tasty! I also baked the fish with frozen veggies (carrots, broccoli and cauliflower) and added a few extra cloves of garlic to bake with the veggies. Loved it and will make again with other kinds of fish!

Made it for the first time for a dinner party.  It was a hit! The bread crumbs keep the salmon nice and moist.  We broiled it to brown the top as one of the reviews suggested.  That was a good suggestion but keep an eye on it cause we burnt the top just a little.  5 minutes was a bit too much, try 2-4 minutes.  We will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I reduced the bread crumbs to the same amount as the Parmesan. The topping was still nice and crispy, but more strongly flavored. I thought the lemon zest might be too strong, but all the flavors were perfectly balanced.

This is sooo good! We have fish twice/week. Finally, a wonderfully different way to make Salmon. I followed the recipe except: 
1. olive oil instead of butter 
2. seasoned bread crumbs instead of fresh
3. sprinkle with lemon before serving

I made them with Greek Style Potatoes from this site. Even better the next day. Thank you.

LOVED this recipe.  It is not to strong, but with plenty of flavor.  I have tried many salomon recipes on this site. So far, this is my favorite.

I scaled this recipe to 4 servings and made it for dinner tonight and the end result was really, very good.  I followed the recipe exactly with one minor exception; I used dried thyme as opposed to fresh.  This was a really quick, easy dish to make on a weeknight using ingredients we always have on hand.

WARNING! This dish may result in uncontrolled pigging out! It's that good. I made this and some buttered squash. My wife is still unconscious, but I managed to get the kitchen cleaned up before succumbing to moose tracks overdose.

This is a great dish!

This was delicious, although I will make a few changes next time: I used Italian style breadcrumbs instead of plain, so we found the additional salt to be a little overwhelming - I'll leave that out in the future. I'll also use less breadcrumbs, as we ended up scraping some off the fish. Otherwise, the flavor was very good, the salmon came out light and flaky, and preparation was simple!

My vegetarian friend started eating some fish.  This was the first meat dish that I have ever prepared for her and it was such a hit that she called the next day because her and her boyfriend wanted the recipe! Very tasty flavors keep the "fishy" taste very subdued.

Lemon Herbed Salmon from link posted to Dinner Craft on FB.

This was delicious. Of course I didn't follow their recipe at all so let me get it down for you. 

Preheat oven to 350º. This is going to bake uncovered for about 20 min or until it flakes with a fork so time your side dishes accordingly. 

Get out a small mixing bowl. Crumble up about 2-3 large table spoon sized pinches of Parmesan cheese, add a TB of dried thyme, a small splash or two of lemon juice because who has time to zest one, add 1 TB of minced garlic and about 2 TB of melted butter.

Now your oven should be heated, so toss in a slice of bread in a shallow dish. You want to crumbled this up to near powder. This can bake while you grease a baking sheet and prepare your salmon. Rinse salmon and pat dry. Lay skin side down in greased (I used a glass) baking dish. 

Get that toast out and let it cool. Crumble it up, and mix it into your seasoning bowl. Now here comes the tricky part... what you want to do is like "spackle" this onto the salmon using the back of the fork works best, but however you get it on there in an even coat works. This amount of mixture cover two fillets nicely. 

That's it. Pretty easy for the amount of flavor!

Great recipe! I made this for myself and my boyfriend, who is extremely picky. I did not think he would like all the herbs and lemon flavor but to my surprise he loved it! Only thing I would change is make less of the crumb mixture because I had tons left over.

Wow, this was great! The topping was so flavorful. I would suggest halving the bread crumbs--you'll have a ton left over!

This was wonderful.  We eat salmon often and I am always looking for a different way to cook it.  I may try substituting the butter with olive oil to make it a little more healthy...I'll see how it tastes!

Very tasty! The breading provided a nice addition to my normal boring salmon recipe. I breaded both sides after brushing them with butter. This is a keeper!

This had great flavor, however, I thought it had WAY too much breadcrumbs.   I halved the amount of breadcrumbs for 5 salmon filets.    Since I still had about half of that amount left over, I decided to use it for my asparagus.   I sautéd the asparagus for 2-3 minutes then covered with the rest of the breadcrumb mixture.    Once covered, I broiled it for a couple of minutes with the salmon at the end.   Great flavors, just wrong proportions.

Loved this recipe. My husband even liked it and he is not a big fan of fish. I cut the breadcrumbs by 1/3 and probably did not use as much lemon zest as called for, but I used a lime olive oil instead of butter so that helped. I also used herbed bread crumbs that I happened to have on hand. We will be making this again!

Great recipe. I did almost everything per recipe, except that I used olive oil instead of butter (it's healthier) and I squirted the salmon with lemon before sprinkling the breading on. It was really good and more interesting, yet just as simple as my usual way of baking salmon with butter and lemon.

terrific easy recipe.  i rescaled for 4 servings and like others have commented, i had an excess of the bread crumb mixture.  still, the flavor was great and the crunch was a nice blend with the texture of the salmon. i didn't change too much except use more parm (freshly grated), thyme and lemon zest but only b/c i needed to balance them with the abundance of bread crumbs. my huny liked it so it works for me!  i'll definitely make again.

Great Recipe.  I made a single fillet, so I altered the quantity of the ingredients.  I used left over corn bread for the bread crumbs and mixed about 1 tsp of Italian bread crumbs.  I also used lemon and the juice and I used arctic char instead of salmon.  Awesome recipe - my husband loved it!!!

The salmon was good.  However, there was way too much crumb topping.  I keep going back to read it again.  I halved everything.  I had to throw most of the topping away. 1 1/2 cups was too much bread crumbs.  They family seemed to like it anyway!

Very disappointed, no flavor. We did use dried herbs (changed measurements accordingly from fresh to dry) because that is all we had on hand. The salmon was moist, but that is all I can say good about it.

This was very easy to make, but we found it too bland.  We added a side of tartar sauce, which helped a lot.  The next time we make this, we will use less bread crumbs.

I used only about 3/4 lb. of salmon and halved the recipe for the topping. Accidentally mixed all the butter in with the bread crumbs, etc. but still turned out great. Used dried parsley flakes and thyme instead of fresh. Took about 35 minutes instead of the stated 25 to bake. Tasted delicious! I would serve with lemon slices to squeeze the juice on next time, just to add a little more of that citrus taste.
