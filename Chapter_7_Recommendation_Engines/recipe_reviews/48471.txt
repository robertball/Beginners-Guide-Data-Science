Anyone who wants a great "fried" green tomato recipe that will not cover the flavor and tang of the tomatoes AND will not clog your arteries, this is it!  I used the basic recipe and tweaked it to my taste--no dill, but did use pepper, salt, garlic powder and onion powder in the cornmeal, then shook just a touch of Parmesean on top of each tomato slice after placing them on the pan and giving them a quick spray of canola oil ... I thought they were divine!

I used a half and half mix of Italian bread crumbs and corn meal, and added half a cap full of Mrs Dash seasoning to the coating and baked it on a baking stone coated w/ a little olive oil ,they turned out great.

I am a huge fan of "fried" green tomatoes, but wanted to try a lower fat version.  These tomatoes were very bland.  Was unhappy with the flavor.

A good variation on this recipe is adding dried ranch seasoning to the cornmeal mixture- it adds a bit more flavor. It's good!

These are a great alternative to fried green tomatoes. I followed the recipe exactly but after 45 minutes, the cornmeal on the underside was still raw and "dusty". I flipped them over, sprinkled with additional oil, and put them under the broiler. Some serving suggestions: use them on a sandwich instead of ripe tomatoes or stack them with chevre between slices and top with roasted red pepper aioli. Less messy, awesome.

After reading other reviews, I added quite a bit more spice (cayenne, lots of seasoned salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders)to the cornmeal. I also cut the tomatoes very thin and dipped them in egg before the cornmeal. I sprayed the cookie sheet and the tops of the tomatoes with Pam before baking and flipped them once during cooking. They came out very flavorful and crisp. I actually fried some of the ones I made to compare and the baked ones are better! They are crisper and way less greasy tasting.

I was eager to try this after enjoying fried green tomatoes, but wishing they were less greasy. There is nothing in this recipe to make the coating crispy when baked. It makes a warm tomato with warm cornmeal.

I am always searching for lowfat alternatives to my favorites.  I have lost over 25 lbs by doing this.  These were a little bland compared to the fried in butter kind - but when trying to remain healthy - i've learned to mix and match lower fat options.  These needed a little more spice and that's it.  Thanks for the recipie...

I enjoyed this, though I added a little more spice. It was nice to have a healthy alternative to frying them. They do get crispy and brown, but you have to slice them thinly. Quite tasty!

this is good and even better with a few changes--spray the slices with olive oil spam and then dredge in the cornmeal--i did this by first laying all of the slices in the baking sheet--spraying them all-flipping them all-spaying other side and then dipping and cooking--add what ever spices you want --i added a smokey spice--i like the slices pretty thin

The concept of this recipe is GREAT- Yes, you need to season it more but if you follow the process-slice thin, flour, egg wash, cornmeal/breadcrumbs you get a great alternative to fried green tomatoes.  And they reheat wonderfully!

I would only give this recipe four stars based on the changes I made to it, otherwise, it seems too bland, and I personally don't like a lot of dill. This recipe is definitely health-conscious, and the changes I made are not...but it's still not fried which must count for something!  Instead of cornmeal, I used panko to which I added melted butter, a pinch of ground cayenne pepper and used another reviewer's suggestion of grated parmesan cheese. I dipped the salted/peppered tomato slices in an egg wash before covering with the panko mixture. I baked according to the instructions but placed the tomatoes on top of a wire cooling rack inside of a foil-covered cookie sheet. This allowed the bottoms to become somewhat crisp without having to turn over.  I made these for a party and they were a big hit. Everyone wanted to know how I did it. I served them on a platter with a dipping sauce I made from a Hidden Valley Ranch mix and added a couple drops of Tobasco Chipotle Pepper Sauce for an extra kick.  These are messy which I think is their only downfall, but very good. Serve them right out of the oven if you can!

Much better than fried! Crispy, not greasy. I cut my tomatoes about 1/4 inch but will make them a bit thicker next time. I let the slices rest for awhile, then shook them in a  bag with the corn meal (+ seasoned bread crumbs), and flipped them 1/2 way through baking. They were crisp on the outside and perfectly done on the inside. We'll make these again before all the green tomatoes are gone.

This is a more than acceptable substitute for fried green tomatoes!  I did find the corn meal was a little dry - next time I will try less or moisten it a little.  The dill is a nice touch.  I roasted the tomatoes at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.

No, it's not quite as tasty as the fried variety but the health benefits make up for the difference.  I did substitute garlic salt.  I have made this several times and experimented with different seasonings.  A good alternative fried.

Nothing really beats fried...but these were all right. I did my own spice blend, including pepper, salt and a garlic and herb mixture. Next time, I think I'll try to flip them in the middle and perhaps dip the tomato slices in egg before the cornmeal.

This was good but did lack in seasoning, so I will add a little garlic or onion powder next time, but overall good for a baked tomato, thanks for sharing.

Yum! I didn't slice most of my tomatoes thin enough so the majority didn't get crispy, but thye were still tasty. They need to be pretty thin, like less than 1/4", to get them really nice and crisp. I served them with the dill sauce from Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce from this site. Thanks!! :)

I found these to be too dry.  I saw a previous comment that said hers were too greasy, but I didn't get that since there is no oil or grease in the recipe.  Perhaps it depends on the tmayders (tomatoes).

I had high hopes for this recipe and thought it would be a good alternative to frying the tomatoes.  I added my usual favorite spices to give it a kick, and threw them in the oven. 
There was nothing to make the coating adhere and crispy - it was like dumping cornmeal on a cooked tomato. Perhaps mixing a small amount of oil in the mixture of cornmeal and spices might help with the texture.  I'll give that a try next time.

Thought this would be a great alternative to fried green tomatoes, but didn't care for these and couldn't finish them. I wish it would have worked because I like the idea of lower calories.

I use a cooling rack and turn them halfway through baking.  I also use a little Italian breadcrumbs and some panko and never a problem with them crisping.

The addition of dill was a nice change.  Baking takes longer but it's worth it.  Next time I will turn them same as if they were fried so they'll be crisp on both sides.

Very disappointed in flavor and texture.  Did not seem like fried green tomatoes at all.  Guess cooking in the grease is the only way...

These were excellent! The taste of fried green tomatoes without the grease and the problem of all the breading falling off! I jist added so e garlic powder to the breading to suit our taste but it was excellent!

Nope, not nearly as good as fried.  I guess if you were really craving them and couldn't have the real deal, then that would be okay.  They just don't crisp up like I wanted and they were a bit chewy.

Bland, and for me, using corn mean overpowers the tomato, does not complement it at all.    I will try again, using other reviewers suggestions of mixing in Italian bread crumbs and maybe some ranch dressing powder (don't add salt if you use ranch dressing powder though, as it is very salty already).  Nutritional yeast would also add a nice flavor component to the mix.   I would also recommend dredging the slices in egg to make the coating stick and to add some crunch.   And probably would work better to bake at higher temp for shorter time period.
