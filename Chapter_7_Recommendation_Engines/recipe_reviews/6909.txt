This recipe was difficult to make and made a mess all over my baking sheets.  The end result was basically a biscuit with a glob of jam in the middle.

I just pulled my first batch of these ourt of the oven and my kids simply love them. I used apricot jam instead of raspberry. Definitely a tasty treat. And so simple to make.

This recipe was extremely easy to put together. I did need to add a little more milk to make the dough come together. I used parchment paper instead of greasing the baking sheet. The trick is to make the biscuits thick enough to start, then making the well deep enough to hold the jam. Biscuits, by nature, rise. These are no exception and more than doubled in height. I used homemade cherry-raspberry jam, but I think they would be tasty with any flavor.

This reminds me of a local treat we get at our State fair. They call them "fair scones". The only difference is that instead of a circle, they are cut in a rectangle and the jam is put on half of the piece of dough and the other half is folded over the top and pinched shut. The jam stays nicely inside and doesn't overcook.

Didn't like these buns that much. The dough seemed to need much more flour than the recipe called for, It was extremely soft and sticky.. the resulting buns are not worth the effort. Thanks anyway.

great concept.  
Be very careful, the jelly gets very hot.  I got a couple burns.  My fault.  Just be aware.
