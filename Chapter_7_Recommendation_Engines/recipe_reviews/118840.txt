This was a great recipe.  I did, however, change it up a bit.  I have just found the zipper steamer bags and have been steaming EVERYTHING!!  I trimmed the aspargus and put it in the zipper steamer bag, mixed up the sauce ingredients and microwaved them for 1 min.  I then poured the sauce in the steamer bag with the aspargus, zipped and steamed!  Turned out perfect!

Yummy!  Some of the best asparagus I have ever had.  You can barely taste the asparagus when it is covered in the sweetness.  I don't have any children, but I would have eaten this when I was a kid.  The always-picky Husband gave his approval.

Good, but doesn't go as well with the flavor of asparagus. Since I like asparagus, I'll stick with cooking it more simply.

Very good glaze. The vinegar adds a nice tanginess to the dish. I'm thinking I may use this with steamed carrots next time.

Delicious!  My hubby isn't normally a fan of "fruity" glazes loved this!

This was good in theory, but the vinegar taste was too strong. We're going to try it again modified and see what happens though, since the apricot and asparagus are great together.

I didn't really love this recipe.  It wasn't bad just not that good.  I found the glaze was too thick and it didn't really look that nice.  I also didn't love the flavor.  Sorry but I won't be making this again.
