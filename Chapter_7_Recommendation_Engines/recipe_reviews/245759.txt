Hands down the best potato wedges I've ever had! Everything about these were delicious and I can't  believe I didn't think of this before. If you like potatoes and you like buffalo flavor then you MUST give this one a try. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. Thanks for the great recipe Hannah!

This is easy and was very good.  The only change I made was I tossed the wedges in buffalo sauce before I baked them, then I drizzle them again.  Even my son ate them and he does not like potatoes except fries.

Easy - delicious and not sure why i never thought of it! I can eat Buffalo sauce on anything - I love it! I omitted the ranch dressing because I am not a fan - however I did put fresh blue cheese crumbles on the hot potatoes super yummy! =)

My family devoured these.  We made two types- one mild and one hot. Super simple and you can easily adjust the heat levels to suit everyone.  These will be part of our menu often.

Too much hot sauce..It was waaay too spicy!...The potatoes were soaked in the sauce...Not crispy at all.
