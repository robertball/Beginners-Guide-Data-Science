This recipe was awesome. Instead of just using the cream cheese mixture, I mixed 4 TBSP of heavy cream with some vanilla extract (to taste)and mixed the cream mixture with the cheese mixture. Simply the most delicious desert

I made this for my grandmother, who is diabetic, and everyone at our family gathering couldn't get enough of it!  I was unable to find a sugar-free angel food cake, so I substituted with Sweet'n Low yellow cake, which you can buy a mix for.  It worked just fine, and this stuff is DELICIOUS!!!  Also, it's pretty easy to make and looks very pretty too...always a nice bonus!
