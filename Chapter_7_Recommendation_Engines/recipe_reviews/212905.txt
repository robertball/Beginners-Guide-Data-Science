good, but VERY pepperminty... think I might try 1/2 oz of peppermint schnapps next time.
UPDATE:  I did 1/2 oz schnapps and it was MUCH better!

Prepared as listed. Was a huge success at my party. Several people had seconds, I had thirds. ;-) I actually ran out. One note: if you're going to be using 10oz martini glasses the batch listed really only makes one glass.

This is very minty, next time I'll just add a drop or two of schnapps. This drink is also excellent with Godiva chocolate liquor.  I recommend a two drink limit with this tasty cocktail! It is so delicious and goes down very smoothly. I think it may be the large amount of sugar in the drink because the headache the  next morning is quite awful!

This sounded fantastic.  I drove to five stores to find the white creme de cacao just so I could make it.  I was so excited when I got home I did a test run before my Christmas Eve party and it's a good thing I did.  I did not care for it at all. I thought it just might be me, but my husband thought so too.  I double checked the recipe and did a second test run with less peppermint schnapps as some reviewers suggested and it was a little better, but not much.  If you have the stuff around, give it a try because all of the other reviews were good, you might like it, but I wouldn't go out of your way like I did.

So easy, and so delicious!  You don't need candy canes - cocktail is white and pretty in the martini glass without it.

Served these Sunday for the cocktail hour and everyone liked them.  They were sweet, so youâ€™re really not going to want to have more than two, perhaps three at the most.  But they are good and I sure I will be making them again in the future.

Recipe as written was too minty for us.  After much experimentation(tough job but someone has to do it!) our favorite version now consists of 1 oz cream, 1 oz chocolate flavored vodka and 2 oz cream de cacao.

This was really yummy !  We used it as an end of the night  dessert drink.  I followed what another reviewer said and only used a splash of peppermint schnapps.  I added a splash of Baileys, dipped the rim in crushed candy canes and added crushed candy cane to the top !  Festive and delicious !

My son made this drink for us and it came out great! He also added a bit of red food coloring for fun!  Will make again. Very mild peppermint taste.

Made it and took advice from reviews and reduced by half the Peppermint Schnapps. Drink was minty as expected..proably could reduce Peppermint Schapps a bit more. But it all depends on you preference. Will make again.

Yum!  I cut the schnapps in half right out of the gate because there's always too much for me.  I may inch it up just a little.  I used chocolate vodka instead of plain (I store many flavors of vodka in my freezer) which was a great success.  Tried adding white chocolate liqueur because lots of peppermint martini recipes use it, but I thought it was too sweet.  It's better this way!
