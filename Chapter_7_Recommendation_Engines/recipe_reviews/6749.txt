This was the best bread I've ever made! I prepared the sponge two days in advance and kept it in the fridge. I had no problems with it being too sticky like others mentioned. I cooked it on a pizza stone and basted with water every 5 minutes for a brown, crunchy crust. The parchment did burn a little around the edges while baking, but it was reminiscent of an old Italian bakery. See my picture -this bread is perfect!

The easiest 'real sourdough' recipie; those without 'aging' of dough lack the genuine ciabatta taste, even though they may get the consistancy right.  This one gets even better with more than one days aging of the 'sponge'.

I cannot tell you how AMAZING this bread is. 3 loaves were gone in under a day and a half! It is crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside and filled with all these lovely bubbly craters! I replaced the milk with water and just baked on a greased and floured baking sheet and it was still wonderful. I cannot rate this recipe highly enough. I served with olive tapenade and caprese salad for appetizers and it was wonderful. My fiance and family could not get enough of it! They beg for it EVERYDAY. Will certainly make again and again and again! 

First, the sponge is amazing. Tastes just as good after only sitting for a few hours as it does after 24+. I made it once and left it for 24 hours in a cool place and that made nice fluffy bread without many air pockets. The second time i made the sponge I left it right next to a warm stove top and it rose very quickly and made these HUGE air pockets in my finished product. I only left this for 4 hours but the taste and texture were FANTASTIC and the sponge almost spilled over the rim of the bowl! It was a bit difficult to get out of the bowl because of its stickiness but that was to be expected. For those that thought the sponge needed water, it doesn't. It will look just like a clump of dough in the beginning but if you leave it you'll be pleasantly surprised with a bubbling, frothy, sticky sponge. 

Secondly, I made this recipe cautiously because I expected it to be very difficult to handle, but it was not.

I have fallen in love with making bread these past few months, and this is the best recipe I have have found, by far. I have made at least 12 loaves with this, and every time I make it, my roommates/friends devour it instantly.   I have modified it a little, though. I found the original recipe to be too dry for my tastes when it came out of the over, so I tripled the olive oil, and it came out moist and delicious. Add more oil to the recipe and you're in great shape. I love this bread!

My husband and I celebrated our 11 year wedding anniversary with Friends and an Italian meal.  Since my husband had visited Italy and collected recipes when we were there, the only one missing was a bread recipe.  It was a little involved as far as prep time but it was easy,GOOD, and tasted just like what we had eaten in Florence!!!!!!!  I will make it again.  For 15 people I made 6 loaves with enough left over for dinner the next night.

I'll start with the good: I've been making bread for a couple years and this is easily the best bread I've made to date.  It was soft, chewy, soaked up butter like a sponge when I served it.

The bad: The "sponge" measurements didn't work for me.  The measurements given resulted in a softball sized ball of dough, not a sponge.  A sponge, as I know it, should be extremely wet and gooey.  I ended up going with equal parts flour and water, as well as additional yeast.  And while a baking stone may produce a nice crusty bottom I've always felt that it took some of the air out of the bread since you're transferring the dough after it's been proofed.  I just baked them on the parchment paper that had already been sprinkled with some cornmeal.  Sat for 90 minutes and was ready to go in the oven.

So while the exact recipe would have been a complete flop for me (sponge not spongy) the overall idea and directions are pretty solid.  I'll definitely be making the modified version again.

Awesome recipe!  It makes such a wonderful, crusty bread that it's tempting to eat the whole loaf!  I didn't have parchment, or a baking stone, so I oiled a cookie sheet, and sprinkled cornmeal on it before making the loaves.  They turned out great!

I made this bread today and it turned just like the ones I've paid big bucks at the especialty's stores. Great taste and texture. I sent a piece of this bread w/my husband's lunch and he shared w/his friend... Next I know he is calling asking me to give a copy of the recipe to  his friend. Hubby compared it w/the breads they serve at fancy restaurants.Everyone in my family love it. The kids even ate it without butter or jam!!!! It is a keeper!!!!

I found this recipe about 6 weeks ago and have made it twice a week since then. It produces an excellent loaf, which makes the most phenomenal sandwiches, brilliant toast for french onion soup, ideal for baked goats'cheese salad, croutons, and dozens of other uses. I bake it until only just done, then freeze it and take it out and cook another five minutes in the oven to recrisp. I make loaves and also cut it into smaller chunks and make mini ciabatta. If you save a couple of tablespoons of the "sponge" when mixing the dough, and boost it with some more flour and water you can set it aside overnight again and the next day you are ready to make more bread. Note - this dough needs to be really floppy to work properly - you might need more water than the recipe states. Also, if you add wholemeal flour it gives a slightly different flavour, but it won't rise as much.

This recipe produces two loaves that taste like they just came out of an Italian bakery.  Plus, there appears to be little need to use a baking stone.  I placed my loaves onto an edgeless baking pan for 20 minutes at 425 degrees and was quite pleased with the results.

Although this bread takes lots of time to prepare, it was well worth the wait!  The crust was fabulous and the texture was great.  It is a great bread for sandwiches.

This recipe made made the best ciabatta out of the three recipes I've tried.

The reason it gets 4/5 is because it does not say what the starter is supposed to look like.

The starter will look like a ball of dough. It is supposed to look like this. Wait an hour or two, and it will turn into a sponge. I usually use slightly less than 1 cup of flour, around 9/10ths.

A variation for stronger sourdough flavor is to increase the amount of yeast. One time I made this I used 1T yeast in the starter, and it had a much stronger flavor.

I use the normal amount when making the bread itself.

I made the sponge day before, today the bread, its the worst. I know ciabatta is bland, but was worse than bland, not to mention the recipe a long drawn out process,mixing little dabs of this and that in little bowls here and there.  Just wondering if anyone else put a damp towel on loaves to rise, how ridiculous, was that! Like laying a towel on a pile of thick glue, I had to scrape all the gooey dough off the towel, then of course nothing left to rise again,plus all the hoopla of stones and paper and transfering from this to that.I finally gave up, put it in the oven to come out looking like a flat glob of tasteless nothing. I will not try this recipe again.

My family LOVES this recipe and we make it all the time. I find the quantites specified make two rather small loaves, so I increase the amount by 50% but still make it into two loaves. If we're having it for lunch, you have to be in the house all morning to make the dough, let it rise etc, so I make the dough the previous evening the let it rise in the fridge overnight. Next morning I take it out and shape it into the loaves and let it rise slowly over the morning before cooking at lunch time. I also spread some olive oil over the top before baking which gives a nice finish.

I rate it 5 stars for ease and taste, but you do some work and end up with enough bread for like a day.  It's enough to make 4 decent sized paninis, so next time i make this, I'm going to triple the recipe or something since this bread holds up well to freezing.  I did make it twice so far in 3 days, I LOVE ciabatta and its super expensive where I live, so thank you Benoit Hogue, you have made my life easier and my house smells like good bread!!

Delicious and simple to follow! I followed some of the other poster's recommendations and added 1 1/2 tbsp more oil, and 1/2 tsp. more salt. I also substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the bread flour, halved between the sponge and the bread. I also added a metal pie pan of water to the bottom shelf of the oven so the crust turned very flaky. This has a delicious sour tang, is chewy inside, and took almost no effort to make! For those who have never made it: the dough will be very sticky and gooey. This is alright! It should be that way.

Mmm very good. The sponge gave a nice sour taste to the bread. I didn't have baking stones, so I baked this on the parchment paper on a cookie sheet. It still tasted great. It was very easy with the majority of the time being hurry up and wait for rising. I will be making this again.

Good Bread! I don't have a stone, so I just baked the loaves  on the center rack for 22 minutes at 425 with a pan of water on the bottom rack.  I also sprayed the loaves with water during the last 5 min of cooking. Turned out so crusty and awesome! These would make great pizzas if you split them lengthwise.

I was looking for a bread machine recipe when this came up.  This works great!  Use the french bread setting, but extend the last rise by 30 minutes.  Great flavor, good sandwich bread.  Makes 1 loaf.

Very good ciabatta.  The longer the sponge sits, the better.  I've let mine sit up to 24 hours and it works well and tastes even better.  Also, if you're baking on a stone and the bottom gets a bit too crusty, put your stone on the middle rack.  The parchment can be cut into two long narrower strips (half your stone width each) to make transfer into the oven easier if you don't have a peel/paddle.  I've even used this dough to make fabulous cinnamon rolls.  Just pafter the initial rise of the complete dough, roll it out gently to  about 3/16" thick.  Mix up about 1-1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white sugar and 2T of cinnamon, then spread it over the rolled out dough.  roll it up carefully, cut into rolls with dental floss or pastry blade, spray the top with nonstick spray, bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.  whip up some icing (I like cream cheese) and enjoy!

Benoit Hogue, You are my personal hero! I have tried various recipes for Italian style breads & no matter what I did, they always came out like doorstops. This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for. The bread came out perfect, light but with good texture & full of air pockets. I'll admit, I had my doubts about such a small quanity of yeast used, but this is a wonderful recipe. I'm making another batch tommorrow & shaping it into smaller rounds to use as bread bowls for homemade beef stew.YUMMY! Thanks again!

I haven't tried authentic Italian ciabatta but I can tell you that my husband who loves bread just raves about this recipie!!!  We no longer have to buy bread at the store anymore...it's practically forbidden!  For those that don't have the baking stones, simply splitting the dough into small casserole or baking dishes works well and gives the bread a nice form.  Something else that has worked well is just to add all the yeast into the starter...the bread comes out just as good! Thank you for the recipie!!!

I added fresh chopped rosemary and chopped garlic to the top before baking.  This came out as good as the insanely expensive loaves the organic bakery sells.  My sponge had to wait about 36 hours and it only got better.  Great recipe, thank you.

Amazing!  Just made my first two loaves last night and I can not wait to make this again.  The dough should be very sticky with a mind of it's own, so try not to add extra flour.  Thank you so much!

Great bread with a good, chewy crust.  An excellent idea to use the parchment paper for the last rising, way better than using a banneton.  Thanks.

Even though I ended up compleatly screwing up this recipe....it STILL came out tasty! My biggest mistake was just reading the ingredients list...not the directions, before taking on this bread. I was stuck inside on a snow day and I thought, "hmm...I've got all those ingredients!!". Well, come to find out, bread flour and all-purpose are not interchangeble, my local walmat does not carry baking stones, and cheap mixers are not equiped to handle bread dough! so while I baked it in a bread pan (not a loaf pan), used all purpose flour, and kneeded it out by hand instead of using a bread hook, it came out great! Maybe not just like ciabatta as it's supposed to...but I won't think twice about making it again!!

Made 6 loaves over the course of 2 days, it is that good! Everyone in the neighborhood loved it. The only change I made was using half and half for the milk. Bread is flavorful with a lovely crunchy crust.  Let it rise the full recommended time to get the bubbles formed correctly and handle the dough gently.

Made the sponge with room temp. water, cover with plastic and just let it sit on the kitchen counter for 8 hrs. Added the rest of the flour (only used all-purpose), salt, more yeast, room temp. milk and water. Stirred and mixed in glass bowl (no mixer) with a silicone spatula.  Dough will be on the wet side and gooey like mashed potato from a blender. After the dough rested an hour or so, I only gently turned it onto itself with an oiled silicone spatula for a minute or so for extra lift power. Be generous with the flouring on the counter so it won´t stick to everything the dough comes in contact with. The entire family thought it was yummy.

A fantastic recipe.  I loved the taste and the reality is that it is a very simple recipe as long as you are around the house for the day.  For my schedule, it is perfect to take 10 minutes to mix up the starter on a Friday or Saturday night, and put the rest together the next day.  I prefer to use Instant dry yeast so I don't have to mix with warm water and wait - you can just mix it in with the dry ingredients.  My only disappointment with this is that as much as I loved the taste, I didn't get those big holes in the loaf that I want.  At this point, I don't care.  This bread recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. Prewarm the 'sponge' bowl with the warm water and place it on a towel or similar rather than put bowl directly on a cold counter to rise. If you have a panini press, form dough into 5" round small loaves. After baking and fully cooled, slice 1/4" think for heavenly gilled Italian panini sandwiches.

Really great simple bread recipe. This recipe makes one nice big loaf.  If you want it a little more airy, not so dense, let the loaf sit covered on your stove top while the oven pre-heats.

Made the recipe yesterday,  when I split the dough in two, the first one I made as directed, the second one I stretched into a pizza; Ciabatta Pizza! The bread loaf was very good, but everyone thought the pizza was the best ever. I will definitely make this again, especially making it into a pizza crust

Great recipe although I feel like the recipe needs more salt. I wish the oven spring would've been bigger, the loaves ended up being wider than expected. Otherwise the crust was great and the bread tasty. I added rosemary and thyme to one of the loaves and it was yummy. Had some friends over and devoured both loaves with some olive oil, salt and pepper.

I like to try different bread recipes and decided to try the recipe, despite some of the pictures that made the bread appear 'quite flat.' I thought the dough was quite sticky on the first rise compared to other doughs I have worked with. Both rises took about an hour longer than suggested, but my home was a little cool this morning. However, I did not understand the reason to divide the dough? 3 cups of flour is more common for 1 loaf of loaf of bread, not two, no matter how much it rises. However, I followed the directions and made two. As I expected, the final result was two very tiny not to mention somewhat flat looking loaves like some of the pictures depicted. I also agree with another reviewer that it requires an awful lot of bowls and moving the dough around way too much. I have no where to store a bread stone in my kitchen. It would have been nice if the directions gave instructions for typical baking sheets found in most home kitchen. This bread may have worked had the final rise been on the actual pan, as it is such a soft dough and can't hold up to a lot of movement, or had I just made one loaf which is all the dough is really able to properly make.

I made this today,using all ap flour and gave the starter/sponge about 7-8 hours, used a tad bit more water. It turned out pretty good, my friends, hubby and brothers polished off almost a whole loaf within 10 minutes of being out of the oven. I omited the baking stone/parchment step. after the first rise i transfered the dough to an oiled 10 x 10 pampered chef stone baking pan and let it rise again before baking. Next time i think i will give starter/sponge much more time for more of that tangy flavour. I've already got my second sponge started! Thanks for a great recipe!Can't wait to try it with stews and soups! update: turned out better second time around-gave starter 15 hours. Dough was stickier which attributed to more of that holey ciabatta texture. Also had a more developed tangy hint. Perfect for sandwiches!

This recipe was quite a bit of work for the end result, but following it (almost) exactly, it turned out really well.  The directions for putting the loaves in the oven aren't very clear - is it supposed to cook on the parchment, or are you supposed to slide it off the parchment as it goes in the oven?  I didn't want to mess with getting the rather gooey loaves transferred to a hot stone, so I did what worked for me.  I flipped a cookie sheet (the kind with edges 'cause that's all I have) upside down, laid a piece of parchment big enough for two loaves, then shaped the loaves on the parchment and let rise.  Then when they were ready for the oven, I just slid the whole parchment with both loaves onto the stone and cooked about 10 minutes to firm up, and then pulled the parchment out from underneat to cook to remaining 10 minutes.  This was a great chewy bread.  I sliced it for bruschetta - which was the main reason I made it.  Then having much leftover (my 3-year-old and I were to only ones eating it), I used some leftover for sandwiches, then some for dipping in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  After 5 days, I still had 4 slices left, which I used to make some french toast.  It was delicious.  This bread was well suited for everything I used it for.  I don't know that I would make it again, just because it is a lengthy process and the end result isn't to die for.

Very good.  I let sponge sit for almost 24 hours.  Bread tastes like mild flavoured sourdough.  Next time I will add  more yeast to sponge to see what happens.  Was excellent sliced, toasted, and filled with hamburger.  Will definately make again (and perhaps top with thyme, salt, pepper, rosemary, etc).

Yum!  I used all-purpose flour and it still turned out great.  Dough is EXTREMELY sticky and therefore a bit difficult to work with, but worth the effort!  I attempted to transfer from a cookie sheet to the baking stone without parchment paper (didn't have any) and ended up deflating one of the loaves in the process as it folded over on itself.  It came out a bit dense but still had a crisp crust and a chewy inside.  The other loaf turned out wonderful.

We love this bread--I can't keep the family's hands off of it long enough for the main course.  I made a few changes--I go even water and flour for the sponge, use a heavy hand on the yeast and I double up on the olive oil.  I wash the tops with olive oil before baking, and spritz with water during the process.  Used Mrs. Dash instead of the salt--excellent.  Today mixing in finely chopped greens from my garden, and I plan on using shredded parmesan cheese on top--we shall see....

I have attempted my first try ~ I am waiting for mixture to rise in bowl ~ its taking a long time to rise ~ but thats ok ~ it is rising ~ its a cold day here in Aotearoa ~ [New Zealand] ~ great to be able to read others comments ~ like ~ leaving sponge in fridge ~ take some sponge out for another starter ~ add more oil ~ shall get around to reading more ~ I shall come back another day and let you know how I get on.  
I always use 'latex free' gloves ~ they are great when handling dough.
Thank you all.

There is definitely not enough yeast in this recipe. Neither the sponge I made on the first day nor the bread itself rose very much. It was tasty enough, but the loaves were very flat and dense.

Easy to follow recipe that yields satisfactory results for a first time ciabatta baker like me. However the crust is not "crusty" enough, i think, like the fluffiness of the interior though.

Really good, and I only let the sponge go 5 hours cause I just couldn't wait any longer.  Mine got a little darker than I wanted but the flavor was Amazing!  It is a VERY sticky dough but the oven works the magic!

Turned out beautifully, like the ciabatta I used to buy from the store and eat with olive oil and balsamic. It is hard to keep away from it!

Due to time constraints, I was only able to let the sponge sit for ten hours and the first rising to sit for one hour so this is why my bread did not have the bigger holes you'd expect in a traditional ciabatta. But the split loaves rose for full two hours and after baking, they were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. It was fabulous, and even  my Italian mother-in-law (a very critical cook) complimented me on how delicious it was. I will make it again, and give it more time to rise for better ciabatta consistency.

This is a tasty bread, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I'd highly recommend AT LEAST doubling the recipes if you're making bread for more than four people, though.  I ran out of this quickly.  Will certainly triple it this time.

This came out crusty, light and impressive looking for guests.  I confess that I didn't mess with the parchment paper/rimless pan transfer; I just let it rise on a silpat sheet and then put that on my pizza stone when it was time to bake.  I may have lost a little crustiness, but it was pretty crisp.  I was expecting a little more flavor because of the starter, maybe like sourdough, but I liked it the way it turned out.

I just made this for my two sister for dinner and it was scrumptious. I do not have an electric mixer so I just used my hands and I promise you it was not harder or longer to do. I only let the sponge proof for 5 hours and the bread was still full of amazing flavour. After I cut the dough into two pieces, I decided to cut them again into thirds to make ciabatta sandwiches. For dinner we had these stuffed with feta, roasted peppers, pumpkin and pesto. It was the most amazing sandwich I have ever had!

This was my first endeavor with bread w/out a bread machine.  I have never had 'authentic' ciabatta, so I had no way to compare, but found this bread to be good.  The dough is SUPER sticky.....but from what I read from others, that is the case.  Thanks for the recipe!

After just having my woodfired oven installed, I was eager to start baking this recipe. I was however, worried when the mix didn't seem wet enough for ciabatta.  Traditional ciabatta is full of air bubbles on the inside and my bread was firm.........what did I do wrong?
The crust was incredibly crunchy, as it helps to spray water in the oven to create steam during cooking.
I will try this recipe again until I get the right bubbly texture and success.

This bread is awesome!  My husband is from Italy, and we have been trying to find a good recipe for bread that is similar to the breads you get in Italy.  THIS IS IT!!  When my mother-in-law came to visit us from Italy, she didn't like the breads that we have here in the US.  She thought they were too soft and too sweet. I just called her and told her she could come back - because I found a bread that she'd like!!  I will be making this one every week.  Thanks!

This is a keeper!  What a great way to get a sourdough type bread without the prolonged starter process.  Will definitely be making this over and over.

Wow! Yummy, chewy, crusty, but only slightly tangy....  think I'll leave the sponge starter for 24 hours instead of only 12 hours and see if it adds to the tang! My breads did stick a it in places that I didn't faithfully 'well flour' so don't skimp! Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! Next time, I might add a bit more flour, but other than that , it was excellent! The "loaves" kind of ran into each other and became one big one. I thought I had measured everything fairly accurately. No worry, though. I used it to make sandwiches fresh out of the oven! We were amazed. It was a little more work intensive than most breads I've made, but it was well worth the effort. Next time, I'll try it with my sough dough starter and see what happens. Thanks!

I've made this bread now twice and I have to say that it is really excellent! Be sure to put the yeast with the water in a large enough bowl because it does grow in volume.   The second time I made it I doubled the recipe because it just didn't make enough.  Doubling the recipe I was able to make 14 nice size rolls ( 4") I baked them for 12 minutes.  I didn't use a baking stone but just heated the cookie sheets with the oven and then slid the rolls which were on parchment paper onto the hot pans.  I did add a bowl of water to the oven and sprayed the oven a couple of times during baking.

I made this recipe but I made rolls instead of loaves and froze half. I also added rosemary and garlic to the rolls and made a few with some red pepper added in addition to the other herbs. No complaints and no leftover rolls.

Not sure what went wrong, I made the sponge exactly as stated but it never turned to sponge, 24 hours later I made the bread dough exactly as stated and it was firm like regular bread dough. My yeast is new and I know it's good because I made several loaves of bread yesterday. I used Better For Bread flour and quality olive oil. I'm not new to bread making... Any thoughts on what went wrong are greatly appreciated.

This recipe is delicious!  I had my doubts with the way it went together (I followed the original recipe)but it turned out great.  Yes, the sponge is sticky, and after kneading the dough is very elastic and gloopy.  But given time, it works!  I mixed the sponge in with the other ingredients by hand (don't have a stand mixer) then threw it all into the bread machine on Dough cycle.  When I took it out, I divided it into 16 mini loaf sized pans and baked them for 20 min.  They came out golden and perfect.  They have a lovely taste, good crumb, and a nice crust.  My British husband loves them as they taste like the bread in England and not the horrible, felt-textured bread here in the States.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Bread was pretty flat, but tasted pretty good.  45 minutes was way too long to heat the stone at 425 degrees - 10 would likely have been fine.  Takes a long time to make with the sponge and rising times, so prior planning is necessary.  Perhaps a bit more yeast and flour and a warmer kitchen! would also have helped it.

Wonderful flavor and texture.  I've made this twice this week, trying to duplicate a commercial ciabatta bun but I'm not getting the shape right as this dough is sticky to work with!  I'll be making it one more time as I think I've got it figured out.  Meanwhile we love this easy recipe.

Made it exactly as written (excepted baked on a Silpat slid onto a baking stone). If you're used to handling "normal" yeast dough, this is a little tricky to deal with since it's not kneaded to an elastic state. Use flour generously. Whatever you do, do NOT skimp on the salt. The salt is what makes this dough manageable, such as it is. You'll have a huge gooey mess if you don't add enough salt. You will love the results! Reminds me a bit of those fresh Tuscan loaves from Italy!

Just finished making this, first try. Did it exactly as directed, except hand kneaded dough instead of mixing in blender. Made 6 perfect sized sandwich rolls. 
Word of caution. The dough is sticky, don't put your loaves near anything that isn't stick resistant (including the other loaves).

I was scared to make this bc I had never done a "sponge" before. It sounded like something complex and chemical that I would be sure to mess up. :) I made this and my first try it turned out perfect!! I think this bread would make great rolls for burgers. I might try my hand at making those next time. I followed this recipe exactly as written and it worked great.

I was really pleased with results - I was lucky enough to have a large silicone mold, so I made mine into one (1) large loaf.  Baked at 425 for about 27 minutes and she came out beautifully.  I do agree with others that if I had to make into 2 loaves, they'd be rather small as the one I made was only barely large than a true loaf of Ciabatta.  In any event, I'll definately make again - thank you so much for recipe.

My family loves this bread!! It doesn't get quite the same crust as the ciabatta I'm used to, but it still has a wonderful flavor and texture. I make this often and am always asked when the next batch is coming.

I didn't get quite the texture that is expected of Ciabatta bread, but the flavor was great.  Texture differences could have came from quality of yeast, kneading time and temperature of rising, but I followed the directions exactly, so I'm rating those results.  I'll make it again and probably increase the time of the first rise, and might use just a touch more yeast in the sponge.

Very yummy!  I made it 1/2 whole wheat and it turned out great.  it turned out with smaller bubbles than I'd hoped for but it was still fantastic.  Perfect for toasting with PB & J!

A fair amount of fussing to make this bread but it sure is tasty and the texture is so chewy and soft at the same time.  It makes 2 nice loaves enough for 8 nice panini sandwiches, if you so choose.  I just cut into very thick slices, sliced those in 1/2 and then put Land o Lakes 50% reduced fat butter on the warm bread.  Just perfect!!

I actually did not make or use the sponge, i used a cup of the sourdough starter recipe from this site!! I have to say that this bread was absolutely delish! I will be making it again next week with my sourdough starter that will be two weeks old by then! The only changes was an increase of the yeast to 1 tsp. and an extra tablespoon of very good quality olive oil...thanks Benoit!

Excellent - takes some time to make, but it's not difficult.  We loved it.  Had it for Italian beef sandwiches.

Thank you! I LOVE to cook and LOVE bread, but I haven't tried to make ANY bread for 20 years, because I was intimidated.  I used your recipe and made 16 Roasted Garlic Ciabatta Rolls and they are wonderful.  I had to put the sponge (and later the dough) on the warm stove because my house is quite cold right now, however, the adjustments worked. Thank you for sharing this with me! Sending my cooking love, Mary Ann

This was great! I made the starter about 14 hours before mixing with remaining ingredients. The flavor was outstanding! I did 2 loaves, one with garlic and parmesan on top, the other plain. Both were a hit! This is real ciabatta and it is great! note: I didn't use a stone, but I baked it at 425 for 18 minutes and it was beautifully done.

This recipe made a really delicious bread that I will definitely be making again.  I do not have a baking stone, so I used the method I use for pizza - simply pre-heat a baking sheet and use the parchment paper to move the dough across.  I am used to ciabatta with a more sour flavour, so next time I will let the starter sit longer and maybe in a warmer place.  We had this with homemade pesto spread on it and the traditional olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip.

This was a great recipe! I'm never very exact with the flour measurement for bread recipes, for this recipe simple add flour until the dough is sticky, but pulls from the side of the bowl.  Also, I added an extra tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil - just for flavor, as well as an extra teaspoon of salt. I've tried this recipe with garlic powder, and whenever I do that I press a sprig of rosemary onto the top. That always wows the guests :). Also, I didn't have a baking stone at the time (I usually use a ceramic unglazed tile that costs about 45 cents!) so I simple baked it on a barely-oiled cookie sheet. It worked just fine! I just had to remember to remove it from the pan and place it on a rack once I got it from the oven, otherwise the bottom sogs up.  Great recipe!

This is a wonderful bread recipe.  However, as written, I cannot seem to get the airy/puffy texture associated with this type of bread.  I have tried the recipe twice as it is written.  According to a person familiar with bread-baking, the dough must be kneaded for quite some time to get the airy texture.  So, in my quest to achieve the perfect consistency, I intend to knead/rise/knead/rise/shape/rise/bake. I'll see if the additional "knead/rise" adds some puff to the bread.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Excellent taste, simple to make, and if you bake for five more minutes, the crust is coarser and a little more flavorful.  I know, it is a matter of preference.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

While the bread was cooling, I had to sample the butt. Then I had to cut a slice for my husband. Then I had to have another slice... Long story short, I'm glad this recipe made 2 loaves!!

Easy simple, and tasteful. Thanks Benoit for this recipe. For those that might have had flat hard tasteless bread... the yeast itself could be to blame, it might not be active or might have died in the rising process.

benoit hogue , you are the wizard of ciabatta. never made ciabatta before and everything worked perfecto! i also had no stones or pizza stone, but i did have a round superstone sassafras. for anyone who has one,follow directions. when you get to step 3, turn your dough right in to your stone that has been dusted with flour. put your lid on and let proof for one and a half to two hours.heat oven to 425, remove lid punch finger holes in dough,return lid to bottom of super stone. bake for 25 min. on bottom shelf, then remove lid and bake for 5 more min. oboy will you have perfect ciabatta, i also have a long loaf super stone it should be great for making sandwich bread, thanks again!

This was good but not great. The ciabatta that I am used to is more bubbly, light and moist. The loaf that I made using this recipe was drier but crisp and dense. I would increase the salt, oil, and water content to provide a tastier, more moist dough and bread.

I'm sure I'll make this again. It was pretty close to what I was hoping for; to be just perfect, I would have liked the bread to be a bit moister and chewier. It was just the slightest bit too dry for me. I am very surprised to see how many reviewers have commented on the sticky-ness of the dough. I followed the recipe to the letter (and double-checked over and over again to make sure I had done it right), and I kept thinking that the dough (the sponge especially) was not nearly as wet as I would have expected; I suspect that this is why the final product was a little drier than I would have wished. Who knows? Maybe it was just the weather around here. At any rate, the bread was good enough that I am willing to go through the process again. And let me just say that this bread makes wonderful toast and is absolutlely superb on a panini grill or counter-top grill for *delicious* sandwiches.  Give it a try for sure. Next go-'round, I think I'll add fresh rosemary to the dough and a little coarse salt on top before baking.

Update:
Made again...doubled water for sponge, added additional cup of bread flour at  mixing.  Bread texture is crispy outside, tender and moist inside.  I used corn meal on parchment paper per other reviewer’s comment.  This is a super easy recipe...a nice once a week bread stock up for the next week.


I increased the water on the sponge step to 2/3cup as the sponge mix was too dry...other than that, great recipe, easy to do!
I did bake on a normal sheet pan on a piece of parchment as I do not yet have a baking stone.  It came out just fine.

I have been baking bread for over 20 years. This is the best bread I have ever made. Excellent. Chewy and delicious. And strangely, it does not go stale after a couple of days in a Ziploc bag. Someone gave me a Panini machine, so I had to get some ciabatta for the sandwiches! Thanks so much for the recipe.

This dough is meant to be sticky. I formed the loaves on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet and after rising, baked it for 10 minutes.  I then removed the paper and baked it another 10 minutes.

I made this with freshly ground 100% whole wheat flour and it wasn't heavy at all. I didn't have time to "babysit" it, so it had way more than 2 hours on the last rise. Really good with a nice thick crust!  Will make this a lot!

This bread is wonderful. Wonderful yeast flavor and soft as silk bread. I ended up putting it in my bread machine to do the kneading. Definately a repeat recipe and good enough to make for a gift. Love it. I don't have a stone but just set it to rise on the cookie sheet prepared with corn meal as suggested on another post.

I made this exactly as written.  It was a very flavorful, crusty, dense bread that was devoured quickly.  It does take a little bit of planning to make this, but the hands on time was minimal.  It baked up pretty much the same shape it went into the oven, so if it goes in flat, it will come out flat.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent! My husband loved the flavor.  I followed the recipe alomost exactly except I kneaded the sponge in the bowl for 4 minutes instead of stirring and I used 1 cup of white whole  wheat flour. Came out looking exactly picture and tasting great!

WOW, this is an EXCELLENT recipe. Taste even better than the delicious Ciabatta bread that you'd get from professional bakeries.  It was chewy and delicious and the crust was magnificent. I followed the recipe to a T except i doubled the salt, e.g. 3 tsp. It was way too much and made the bread very salty ( which i don't mind coz i love salt but i do not recommend anyone else doing so).  Also, it IS a very sticky dough. To make ti easier, i used my bread machine, dough selection to do the kneading. 8 minute is no where near enough to create the nooks and cranny in the bread. I let my dough knead for 30 minutes! Also, i didnt have parchment paper, so after the 1st rising, i just split the dough onto 2 pan with aluminum foiled sprayed with cookign spray, did hte 2nd rising then popped it straight into my toaster oven. VOILA, it is so so good and it comes out perfect.  since my bread is over salty already, i will be making avacado/tomato/arugala sandwich with mine and no salt needed!  thanks so much for the recipe!

The taste was fantastic, but the heat was too high! Idk, i smelled it starting to burn halfway through. I moved it up to the middle rack at that point, but I still was way overdone on the bottom. The taste was so delicious tho that I'm starting over today. I'm definitely going to top it with fresh herbs (rosemary & thyme) today after I separate the dough, and let it 'rise into' the herbs before baking. Great recipe, just be careful of the high heat in the bottom of the oven.

Ok this bread is VERY good -in fact I'm still eating on it! Does have a little bit of a sourdough taste , slightly chewy but not dry. However I was taken aback by how runny the dough was. I was expecting a wet dough but it was more like batter! 
- I did add 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, not one.
Had to work some flour into it to even move it on to the baking pan, picked it up with my scraper and kind of plopped it down. No shaping needed! 
Baked at 425 for 20 min. and though it was rather
pale golden - it was done.  I'm going to give it 5 stars because it seemed to be rather forgiving -as I did add more yeast than called for, and it is NO knead which is great, and it does taste great.

I made this recipe on Monday but I had no bread flour on hand so I made it with AP flour. It was sooo good that I made more sponge yesterday and starting more Ciabatta today.

Very good bread, but very tricky- I've made it a few times with a 50/50 chance of it coming out. Have to follow directions to a T.

Fabulous! My sponge sat for 16 hours.  I split the dough in two and baked on a sheet pan sprayed w/ cooking spray and dusted with cornmeal. It is very important to remember the dough is supposed to be wet and sticky, otherwise you wont get the nook and cranny texture.

These were delicious and not difficult to make. Yes, the recipe takes quite a while. I let my sponge sit about 14 hours before beginning the bread. I left one loaf plain and sprinkled one with a mixture of parm and garlic. I finally used my pizza stone for this recipe. It wasn't big enough for both loaves, so I also used a preheated airbake cookie sheet and switched the loaves halfway through. My husband ate most of one loaf with dinner. Thanks for a keeper!

This was my first time attempting to make this delicious bread to accompany a soup. The result was fantastic. A little time consuming, but all the more worthwhile. A perfect recipe to bake and take to a friend's house. It keeps well and was wonderful fresh out of the oven or sliced and toasted a few days later.

what a great recipe!  I have been 'feeding' and caring for the original sponge when I first made this recipe for over a month now.  my BF asks me to make 'that wonderful bread' again and again.  so easy, now that the sponge is in the fridge!  and you only need take it out a day or so ahead.  I just can't rave enough about this.  would give it ten stars if I could!  :)
thanks so much for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Good recipe for a good hearty bread.  My crust didn't turn out as crusty as I would have wanted, and I even misted, but that was no problem, everyone loved it.

Not fun working with wet runny dough. Also what are you supposed to cover it with for the rising period? I tried plastic wrap sprayed with Bakers Joy and it did not work. The finished product was flat and tasteless. I'll be making a trip to Panara Bread tomorrow.

very good bread recipe. I will double next time. I was able to make 9 individual ciabatta loaves with original yield. My son ate 4 in one sitting. didn't have bread flour on hand, so used AP and turned out fine. Also added extra T of olive oil becuase I like olive oil.

I made Ciabatta rolls with this recipe. They had a good airy texture and a crispy crust. The recipe made only 5 of them. This was much too much work for some simple rolls. Next time I will drive to Costco and buy a whole dozen and save my precious time to do something else.

This recipe was wonderful! It was easy to follow and produced two loaves of incredible bread! I added a little garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the original recipe and it was fantastic! The dough was slightly sticky but not so much that it was difficult to handle. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a delicious bread with a minimum amount of work, and the waiting is definately worth it!!!!

I love this recipe definitely a very simple one to follow. Only adjustments I made was as previously commented the water misting of the bread for the first ten minutes and I adjusted my heat to 375.

Works every time, I tend to add a little more yeast and salt. Sometimes also add some rosemary or garlic to make it an appetizer.

I’ve made this twice. The first time I let the sponge rest for 4 hours. The second time I let it rest overnight. It didn’t make a bit of difference in my opinion. I followed directions to a T, except for the sponge prep time.

I will make this recipe again. It did not rise quite as much as I had hoped, but I think that's because we're at 6600 ft elevation. I will add a small amount of baking powder like I've learned to with other recipes. Also, I cut the amount of salt in half on almost all recipes, but I cut too much this time. It impacted the taste. Overall, the fam said it was very good, and would like to see it again.

Ihave had good success with this one and we make it once a week now. I have added grated garlic and make wonderful toast with it. 
Two  vital things are to make sure and develop your yeast at the proper temperature and for the proper time, and don't knead the dough!

Having a hard time offering a fair rating because this is the first time I've ever attempted Ciabatta.  My result was mediocre, but that is most likely due to my inexperience.  I did not achieve the beautiful air pockets that ciabatta is known for.  Never the less, my family gobbled it up.  I will try again in the near future.

Although we didn't use a standing mixer and did everything by hand the bread came out great!  Crust wasn't as chewy as we would have liked but the flavor of ciabatta was there!

Awesome. I followed this recipe and a few tips from Paul Hollywood ;) Prove in a square container (so you can easily shape it later) and gently pour it out onto your baking surface. I cut it into 4 long loaves and slightly stretched them out. After baking, eat with some butter or cheese. ????

I made this. It was a whole lotta hassle for a whole lot of nothing.  Mine came out just straight plain white bread no holes at all. The crust was way too hard and the bread did not rise very well in the oven.  Also the bread on the inside was supposed to be full of holes and such but for some reason mine came out almost with the consistency of cake. really thick and moist. Also it has way too much of a yeast flavor and is otherwise quite flavorless. I Can't make sandwiches out of this.  Which is what I wanted it for.

Would be better off buying wonderbread.

I doubled the recipe and made small loaves. I had to tent them to keep them from browning too much, but the loaves were excellent. I used a very healthy and active 100-year-old starter and had to guesstimate the amount for the recipe. I'll definitely make this again!

This was the first bread that I ever tried to make and it turned out better than I had expected.  The directions were very easy to follow which was a blessing for a first time bread maker.  This bread works so go for dipping in herb infused olive oil.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent! I found it easy to make. You just have to plan ahead. The sponge gives the bread a lovely deliciousness and aroma. The crust was crisp, bread texture fine. I had to wait just over 24 h to make the bread. For the coarser texture, I expect letting the sponge sit 8 to 12 h will make the difference. Next time.

It was really good! If you like a ciabatta without a super crusty top but a dense inside and deep flavor, this is the recipe for you! I added some finely chopped fresh rosemary and honey and it was really delicious.

FANtastic. Not hard if you make breads. I was worried by how much it flattened during the last rise, but it still had enough oomph in the oven and while it turned out to be a flattish loaf, the shape was fine and the bread itself had a marvelous taste and texture.

Very easy to make. 
Next time I will add a bit of rosemary to see how that turns out.

It was my first attempt at making a homemade bread. Instructions should read "heavily flour bread and then cover with wet cloth" instead of "lightly flour". The dough stuck badly to the cloths. Also, this does not taste anything like ciabatta bread. I agree with other bakers that this is more of a sourdough recipe.

One of the best breads I have made!  The biga sponge creates a nice sourdough flavor.   Be careful not to add much flour as it is supposed to be a very wet dough.  And also take care not to deflate it while being worked with.   For a crisp crust, create steam in the oven by spraying water inside right after inserting the loaves or pour ice in a hot pan on the bottom rack.

I followed the recipe except I didn't have a big enough stone for 2 loaves.  I baked one on the stone and the other on a baking sheet.  The baking sheet one cooked faster and the bottom was darker than the stone with the same amount of time.  So, I would cut down a minute or two if using a baking sheet.  Family loved it and it was gone very quickly!

It was easy to follow. The sponge turned out just like it should. The only problem I had was that the loaves seemed to really flatten out during the second rising. I did not use a stone, I used a silicone sheet with cornmeal and flour. I cut it into 8 pieces to make buns .If anyone has an idea on what I can do to get it to stay higher rather than flatten out would greatly appreciate it.
Everyone in the house loved the flavor.

This is so good and so forgiving.  I mixed up the sponge the other evening and when I realized I wouldn't have the time after all to bake it the next day, I placed in fridge for 24 hours or so.  Pulled out and brought to room temp and continued with recipe.  I mixed all ingredients in food processor and pulsed until dough formed a ball which only took about a minute as opposed to eight minutes using a mixer.  Baked at 400 degrees on cookie sheet for 30 minutes.  Only change I will make next time is use a little less salt and add a little sugar.  Will be making this often.  I make delicious garlic toast with it.  Do not let the sponge fool you.  It won't look like a sponge until it sits out for a couple of hours.

I followed the recipe as is, but I did leave the dough out to rise for much longer than the directions called for. I made the sponge one morning and then the next morning I made the bread. I left the dough out to rise at room temperature until about 5:30pm, so it had so many air bubbles in it. I also did not make two loaves, just one big one. I loved the texture of this bread: chewy yet crunchy crust with an extremely soft and tender inside. Slightly sour taste, amazing flavor all around. My family of 4 ate the entire loaf in one night! I will definitely make this again.

I have tried baking bread for years but this one is the best one I have ever made. My husband said we don't have to buy bread from the store just keep making this. He thought it is my own recipe, I said no I got it from all recipe.com. The only changes I made is I added just a 1/4 cup more of warm water to the starter because I wanted it a little more gooey. I saw on other website that there starter is a little kind of runny. But the bread came out spongy and so good. Today I am making another loaf. We devoured almost all of the first loaf. Oh! I did not devide mine in two loaves I just bake the whole thing on a cookie sheet with partchment paper and I sprinkled it with corn meal. I don't have blender I used spatclula in blending the starter and the dough bread, and yep I dash the dough with a little flour and spray it with water. I was so thrilled to see how perfect it came out.

I adapted this recipe to make the dough in my bread maker, and I doubled it. It took a couple of tries to get it right, but here is how I made it work beautifully:
1) Make sponge in bread maker pan, running the dough cycle just to stir the ingredients for a few minutes, then turn off the machine. Briefly remove the sponge from the pan in order to oil the pan. Return sponge to pan and let sit overnight.
2) When ready to make bread, add 1 1/3 c plus 2 T water and 1 tsp yeast around sponge; stir water and yeast gently without disturbing sponge. Add 2 T olive oil. Add 4 cups flour and 2 tsp salt. 
3) Set bread maker for dough cycle and let it run all the way through. 
4) Let dough rise until double in size and filled with bubbles. 
5) Turn dough out onto floured surface and cut in half. Prepare loaves as directed and place on 2 silicone baking mats. Let rise 1-2 hours or until doubled in size. 
6) Preheat oven to 400, then place a pan of boiling water in bottom of oven to create crisp crust.
7) Bake as directed

I added a little more yeast to both steps that called for it and the bread turned out better than the original.  Letting the sponge set longer rather than shorter gave more flavor.  Also made one large loaf instead of two smaller with the recommended ingredients.

This bread is incredible. I took the advice and made the sponge a 1-to-1 ratio flour and water and reduced the water to 1/2 cup when making the bread. Since I live in high elevation (6000 ft.) I increased the flour by 1/4 cup when making the bread. It seemed like the bake time was a little long, only had mine in for 30 minutes and made one large loaf. It is the best bread I have ever made. Thank you for sharing!

I found this recipe rather easy to follow. This is the 2nd bread I've ever baked and I appreciated the taste.

*One thing special I did that I saw mentioned: I misted 3 times during the first ten minutes. I don't know if it helped but it turned out well.

As others mention, at first, the biga was not as liquid as other recipes. when you return to it the next day you'll find that it has settled some into a rather gooey paste.

Nothing to add except in response to ydnandrew's concern about the sponge - had your tried it, you would see that it gets plenty wet and spongy after setting out overnight.

I'm giving this bread 5 stars for taste and easiness.  I made two batches; one I let the starter do its thing for 10 hours and the other I left for over a day.

 The one that I left for 10 hours turned out bland, little crumb factor and too dense. Wasn't good at all. 

The one I left for over a day turned into something yummy. I knew it would be good from the way the starter smelled. I divided this one into ciabatta buns instead of loaves and they came out beautifully. The taste was awesome and the crumb was significantly better than the batch from the previous day. 

So my tips for this recipe:
-the longer the starter rests the more developed the flavour and crumb will be
-I recommend doubling it as it doesn't make much and since it's so good,they go fast
-don't skimp out with the time!

This is a lengthy process but worth the effort. If you have never made ciabata bread this is very moist and sticky all through the process so don't get discouraged.

Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for!  I mixed up the sponge last night. Today I put it and the rest of the ingredients in my bread maker on the dough setting. Took the dough ball out, split it in half, made it into 2 ovals, put a little flour on top, baked 20 minutes and perfection!

I used one cup of my own sourdough started that lives in my fridge. I think it made the dough wetter but I just added more flour. Really nice bread. Wet and wobble-y but easy to work with.

Soooo good! I was surprised how wet and sticky the dough was. I'm not used to that- and I make a lot of bread. I used one regular cookie sheet lined with parchment and sprinkled with cornmeal for both loaves. New family favorite.

It turned out great! I didn't use a baking stone, I oiled a cookie pan. I also let it rise for only 5 minutes (instead of 90minutes) after dividing the dough and still turned out great. I used a whole packet of Fleischmann yeast which is more than the recipe calls for and wasn't too yeasty. Last I sprayed the bread every 5 minutes when baking it and that helped it to form a nice crust. Will do it again

I took the time to prepare as directed.  I let the sponge sit for 24 hours.  It didn't taste too sour.  I doubled the recipe.  It is a good thing I put at least one in the freezer because the other three are gone after only 2 days.

Good bread. I added 1 tsp of sugar to give the yeast something to snack on. I do not have a fancy mixer with the dough hook and could not knead by hand (too sticky), so I stirred it with a regular teaspoon end over end and high as if my spoon was like a ferris wheel. The dough travelled up till my thumb was covered but I did not stop or put the spoon down while I was stirring.  The texture changed to elastic at about 15 minutes and I could draw the dough up about 8 inches without it stretching too far and breaking. No parchment paper either, so the next rising was done in those small foil loaf pans. After it was done I painted the top with real butter and sprinkled with pretzel salt. It was nice and light, but mine was fine textured instead of having the swiss cheese-like holes throughout.
What is called a "sponge" in the recipe is called sour-dough starter by us down here in rural northern florida.

I followed this recipe to the letter. The taste is great and the crust super yummy. The only downside is I didn't get the big bubbles inside like I had hoped. It is humid and raining today maybe that has something to do with it. Not the most simplistic of recipes but hopefully it will seem easier the more I make it. This would have gotten 5 stars had it risen better.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I let the starter sit for 24 hours instead of 12 hoping for a better flavor, but was disappointed.  It's good bread, but no better than a loaf I can make in 3 hours.  I'll be trying a real sourdough next.

This did not work for me at all - the 'sponge' wasn't spongey at all, more like a blob of dough.  I kept at it anyway, and it seemed to be going OK until I baked it and it rose like a normal loaf of bread in the over.  Not sure what went wrong as I followed the recipe to the word.  I won't try this again.

Sponge: The water/flour ratio was a little off; due to high altitude.  Had to adjust to 2/3 c. warm water to 1 c. flour.  Didn't get alot of CO2 action (large bubbles/holes) but got a few; the texture however was awesome.  Crispy, chewy and so yummy.

At first, I thought this was too soft for what I wanted, but perhaps I should have baked it a little longer. Toasted, and topped with fresh tomato, salt and pepper, fresh basil and drizzled with olive oil and it was sensational! I made it into one big loaf and it was the size I wanted. My husband said it was better than anything we could buy here. I made it again using half ww flour, and it still turned out perfectly, a little heavier, which is probably more what I wanted. The dough is very sticky (ciabatta dough is supposed to be), but I added just enough extra flour to make it workable. I find it quite easy to make the starter, put it in the fridge and forget about it for about a day. I am already being asked when I'm making that delicious bread again!

Just cut the ciabatta about hour ago, the texture is really nice, has a good taste but think it needs just a tad more salt to develope a stronger taste.  OVerall like very much and will make again.

Wonderful!  Just let it raise on the baking sheet;  as I don't have a stone; and found the first time I'd tried to make this; sliding it onto a preheated baking tray deflated the loaves a bit.  Spritzed it with water a good few times while baking (about 4-5); tried it in muffin tins as 'rolls', did baguettes; as well as a full sized loaf; hubby's eaten nearly the full sized loaf all by himself - will absolutely make again!

Fabulous recipe!! I have never made this before, and it worked quite well and the bread was amazing.   I made smaller rolls so that I could use them for sandwiches.  For me, I was satisfied with the parchment paper on metal baking sheet, they came out beautiful...I baked them for 12 minutes on the top oven rack.  Can't wait to eat more!!

I really enjoyed this - was my first bread recipe that used a sponge.  I was surprised to read peoples "sticky" comments - I found the sponge to be like playdough and the dough just seemed normal.  I have another sponge going right now, so I'll be more careful with my measurements.  Absolutely delicious.  I made a big fat turkey/swiss/avocado sandwich and loved every bite!!~

Definitely a wet dough, but the loaves came out wonderfully.

I've only tried this once.  I put it in the oven during preheat and the bread came out very flat.  Still yummy bread regardless of appearance.  Want to try again.

Delicious!  Next time we will knead it longer for a airier texture as others have suggested.  

As the loaves were cooling down, I drizzled the tops with butter and added a bit of salt.  We can't wait to make this again.

Absolutely the best bread! When I make this, neither myself nor my husband can control ourselves. We'll 'try it' until a whole loaf is gone!

This was my very first loaf of bread and it was wonderful!  I love that there wasn't a lot of kneading.  I wasn't sure when the dough had completed it final doubling, so I cooked the loaves one at a time.  I put the first in a little too soon, but the second was 'perfect' according to my fiance.

This didn't taste anything like the ciabatta we have here in NZ. I was disappointed after such a time consuming recipe. I think it required more density and more olive oil to give it that real flavour.

I tried this recipe three times.  Although my yeast was fresh(and different each time), I had a major problem with the rise.  The bread was good, but was much flatter than the ciabatta I purchase.  I know ciabatta is a flatter bread, but this was about an inch tall.

We used our own sourdough starter with this recipe that we got from this web site.  Has great taste and turned out wonderful.  Thanks!

This did'nt turn out well for me at all. It did'nt rise well. I did end up baking it, and they were flat disks! I gave this a 3 because I really liked the taste of them. I've never had a problem with bread before, but maybe I did something wrong?

The only complaint I have about this recipe is that my family found it to be too salty.  I cut the salt way down to about 1/2 tsp.  Other than that it was very good.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

I've made this recipe several times and it has consistently been great.  Excellent  texture- I love good bread, and I love bread I don't have to knead alot- this satisfies both categories!

The inside texture of this bread was great, but the flavor was just kind of bland.  Maybe it's that I tend to make and eat a lot of robust, hearty rustic breads and this one was just much lighter in flavor than what I am used to.  I would like to have had a more crispy outer texture though.  It will make a great sandwich bread, but I don't think I will be making this recipe again...I will be going back to a more rustic, heavy ciabatta recipe. Thanks though - I'm sure many other bakers will enjoy it!

This recipe is a great introduction to using a starter that you make the day before baking the bread. I can't believe the difference a 24-hour wait makes in the taste of the bread--the flavor is so much more developed, slightly sour, and totally addicting. That said, I was surprised by how little the oval loaves rose on the second rise, but they did puff up pretty well while baking. I'm thinking that the next time I make this recipe, I won't make two loaves. Instead, I'll use all the dough this recipe makes to produce one, bigger loaf.
