You can put just about anything into a flour tortilla and I swear it will taste good!  This was no exception and was perfect for "breakfast on the go", not to mention a lot healthier and cheaper than fast food. I used one less egg and reduced fat Cheddar cheese and chopped fresh tomatoes vs. salsa  - great breakfast treat!

Always a quick, reliable, easy and very versatile stand-by.  And for some reason I find that when I make these Hubs and I tend to eat less!  I make this with three eggs and two slices of bacon and that's plenty for the two of us.  With a traditional bacon and egg breakfast it would probably be five eggs and five pieces of bacon, and that's not including the toast! (I don't get it...)

I used red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper, four egg whites and two full eggs, 2% sharp cheddar cheese and turkey bacon. The kids thought this was GREAT. I garnished mine with loads of hot sauce and homemade salsa.

Delicious and filling!  I will definitely be making this one again and again.  My only suggestion would be to leave out the salt from the eggs.  I found that the bacon and cheese salted the mixture enough and that the extra salt in the eggs was a little much.   Other than that, quick, simple, tasty and satisfying!

I made these burritos with fresh peppers and tomatoes from the garden and they were so delicous!
