My wife made this for me and I asked her to let me review it since I thought it was one of the best dishes that she has made since coming back to the states.  This was GREAT. I loved the smokey barbacue taste that she got from a slow cooker. I actually did not believe her when she said she put it in the crockpot.  She mixed the liquid smoke with the barbacue sauce and only added the dry rub onto the brisket.  She then after six hours took the brisket and put it on a grill pan to get the grill marks then tossed it back into the crockpot with the sauce.  This was just fork tender fall apart.  Excellent smokey BBQ taste.  I honestly thought that she had grilled this on the grill. When I got home she had this outstanding BBQ meal set on the table with candles and it's the best American BBQ meal I've had since being back home.  Tomorrow I will be sending her flowers.

I'm still trying to figure out the comment made by another reviewer stating that searing the meat would make this recipe even easier. To me that's an added and wasted step so I cooked this exactly as written with wonderful results. The liquid smoke amount was perfect and did not overpower the dish; only added some incredible flavor. Tender and delicious. Thank you so much Miss Shannon!

When I look at recipes I often look for convenience too.  Of course, the ratings help in deciding whether to go for it or not.  Crock pot recipes have become my "Busy day" or "Busy week" saviors.  I work 40+ hours a week, have a big home, have 3 kids, a husband, 2 dogs, 2 cats and a house full of family visiting... The point is, I am so thankful for a recipe that not only is Great (as written) but also brings that convenience and peace of mind of having a meal on the table and not just another snack night.  I live in Texas and know a little about Brisket.  If you like brisket and convenience you will like this as well.  Thank you Shannon!

This turned out so gooooood.  After reading the reviews I made the recipe as written and have to wonder if maybe the reviews stating the liquid smoke was overpowering maybe used a smaller cut than called for.  This turned out great for us and is a great come home to meal after a busy day at work.  Thanks so much for the post.

This was really, really good!  We cooked it for about 8 hours and then cut it up and put it back in with the sauce for a bit before serving.  The rub is very spicy, so it helps to mix it in with the bbq sauce before serving.  I made it just as written and it was great!

I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could.  This brisket is absolutely delicious with the added benefit of being so easy to prepare in the slow cooker.  What a wonderful meal to come home to after a long day.  Thanks Shannon for sharing.  This is one recipe that will be going in my favorites box.  :)

My husband will only eat brisket when it's done in the slow cooker, so this was ideal. I had some trouble finding liquid smoke but it was worth the bother. I've never used it before and it definitely added to the taste. I know I've got a winner when my picky daughter asks for seconds. I'll make this again without a doubt. Thankyou Shannon.

Made this for a football party on Sunday and doubled it.  Every last bit was gone.  I did not add the BBQ sauce to the slow cooker because I had different types of sauce (Memphis, honey, Kansas City etc.) out for everyone to make their own favorite.  I also made it Saturday, shredded the meat and put it in a foil pan.  I put the juices in a separate container to refrigerate overnight. On game day, I took the fat off the juices and added them to the foil pan.  Put the covered pan in a 250 degree oven and slowly warmed it up.  It was  fabulous.  I am making it again next week for a different party and will do it with one sauce and add it to the cooker this time.  I am sure it will be just as good.  Thanks for an unbelievably easy and TASTY recipe!

Sweet Lord, this is hands down the best brisket to ever come from anyplace other than a full up pit.   Where's that sixth star???  I did not deviate from the recipe.  My brisket came from the meat dept at Albertsons, was 3.85 lbs with about 1/4 inch of fat on top, which I left intact, and put that side up in the crock after prepping the meat.  I did high temp on the crock for an hour, and went to low.  I started at 8 am this morning to 3:25 today, and it's ready to go.  Thanks so much, Shannon!

I love the crockpot, but for brisket, it limits the size.  Try the same recipe but put it in a slow (200 degrees) oven.  Cover it tightly with foil.  Should be ready in six hours or more.

I did not like this at all.  The liquid smoke over powered the entire flavor.  I tried to put it on a roll to dilute some of that taste – it didn’t work.   I wouldn't make this again.

The basic idea is sound, but for best flavor the meat should be seared on all sides before slow cooking. Another reviewer said searing makes it easier, yet another said that couldn't be and just added a step. I've made this, and other beef recipes in a slow cooker and searing is needed, otherwise you just have boiled beef with spices. BTW, liquid smoke IS NOT Necessary, and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is investigating the safety of liquid smoke as a food flavoring as being possibly carcinogenic.

This was pretty good.  I have a recipe that I will stick with but this was worth the try.  It made the house smell like a rib crib but the taste was lacking something.  I prob will not try again.  Sorry.

This was sooo good! I made a 4 lb brisket and all I changed was using 1 3/4 cup Famous Dave's Sweet and Sassy BBQ and 1/4 Famous Dave's Devil's Spit BBQ sauce. Fantastic! Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe even without the liquid smoke, which I didn't want to bother trying to find. The meat gets nice and tender, and the spice rub gives the flavor a kick. I need to try it with potatoes so we don't waste so much of the sauce!

Great recipe! Will definitely will make again and again. So easy and so good. Followed the recipe exactly.
Don't understand how people change the recipe and then rate what the new recipe taste like. Not a true rating of the original recipe.

This is the best brisket I've ever made!

Followed the directions exactly, and also poked a few holes in the meat in order to let the sauce soak in. 

Cooked for about 8 hours on low and the meat came out perfect- literally falling apart. Can't wait to make this again.

This was excellent!  The dry rub was very flavorful.  After the meat was cooked and sliced, we dunked the slices into the sauce.  Yummy!  I will add that you are probably better to cook this closer to 8 hours than 10 hours, unless your brisket is a good bit larger than the recipe calls for.  Ours was almost 3 pounds and we cooked it for 9 1/2 hours (since we were at work).  It was a little bit dry, but when dipped into the barbecue sauce it was not even noticeable.  Do not hesitate to try this- it is great.

This is actually a very good recipe for bbq brisket using a slow cooker. I think one of the previous reviewers may have overdone the liquid smoke and used a concentrate without dilution because if you compare to other recipes, it's quite a small amount for such a large cut of meat. I've tried several bbq brisket recipes and having lived in bbq country, find this is the best without the hassle of having to fire up a smoker and soak hickory chips, etc.

I have never had brisket in my life before and this recipe is super easy and comes out EXACTLY as it says it will!  If you don't like spicy, be careful, it's a doozy :)  Seriously though, I was hesitant because I felt brisket was expensive - and I had never made it before, but it turned out great.  This was a perfect starter recipe for a new brisket maker, thanks Shannon I really appreciate you sharing it!  

I should note that I DID rub the liquid smoke and dry spices in the night before - as suggested, it really was good.  Going to eat the left overs tomorrow with a cool cucumber salad, as this was one hot dish!!!

I've made this 3-4 times and it's amazing!  Even my brother who lives in Texas and eats a fair amount of brisket thought it was awesome.  I recommend cooking in a crock pot or roaster slightly larger than you think you need so the sauce only covers the bottom portion of the brisket.  Don't worry, their will be plenty of sauce.  Finally, you don't have to worry about needing more rub, this recipe make more than enough.

The flavor was fantastic and it was easy to prepare. I didn't have liquid smoke but didn't miss it. For those who thought it was to salty you might want to check the sodium content on the bbq sauce. Also, I found that if I let it sit for a bit before serving it helps the flavors come together. I noticed that the recipe didn't say what temp to cook it at; I cooked 3 pounds of meat on high for 5 1/2 hours; I had to add a little water since the sauce boiled down quickly.

Nice rub! Since I using a smaller brisket, I altered the recipe. I baked it instead because it was too late to be using a slow cooker. What I did was rubbed it with everything (except worshitershire/bbq sauce) then wrapped with heavy duty foil. Few minutes before being done, I basted it with Sweet Baby Rays and broiled it to carmelized. I really think it was too peppery so cut that down next time. Though, my daughter didn't seem to mind at all.

I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will make sure not to put the spices on the meat like that..perhaps just mix everything in the crock pot Too much stuff and they cooked as a layer on the meat that didn't taste great. I will also cook for less time. 8 hours on low was overdone for my crockpot.

Hello!!!  This was fabulous!  My family LOVED it!  And it made a ton!  You'd never know it was in the slow cooker.  I agree, however, to reduce the thyme.  It was too much.  Otherwise this recipe is wonderful!  Night 1: I sliced it and served it dinner-style, night 2: I shedded the leftovers and served on buns.  Great both ways.

Okay this is the first recipe I've ever given a poor rating to. I can't believe it considering all the great comments here. I prepared the recipe as written, being careful to use a 3lb brisket and measured out all the ingredients. It turned out WAY too salty, dry and spicy. If you are considering making this my advice would be to add a cup of water to the sauce and leave out the salt and cayenne. There is more than enough salt in the liquid smoke and BBQ sauce. I will not be making this again.

Outstanding!  We cannot barbeque on a grill in our condo, so what to do.  This hits the spot.  We add 1 cup of red wine with Worcestershire and barbeque sauces to crock pot before cooking - makes more sauce.  And we add 1 chopped onion to pot about 2-3 hours before it is done.  And we get requests for recipe.

Super yummy brisket. Really easy to make. Loved it, even though it was not as good as the brisket a friend of my husband used to make. But since i can't get his recipe i will def. stick to this one, because it is delicious.

I followed the recipe and made no changes.  Maybe I'm too much of a purist because this was too spicy for my tastes.  The black pepper was overpowering.  The meat was very dry, but maybe I got a bad cut.  I'll keep looking for the perfect brisket recipe. I won't be making this again.

I decided to follow the recipe exactly b/c of the few negative reviews I read; 3 lb brisket, trimmed of fat (which actually may have helped to tone down the spices had I left it on), carefully measured the spices and liquid smoke (which I use often, btw), cooked for 10 hours on low in a brand new crockpot. 

The meat was indeed very tender, but the spices were completely overwhelming and the liquid smoke left a weirdly bitter aftertaste.
I think the problem with this recipe is that it's an attempt to get a slow-cooked bbq flavor without the bother of tending a bbq for hours. Should have figured that this shortcut would NOT work. HOWEVER, using the spice rub alone, refrigerating the cut overnight and actually putting it on a slow grill and occasionally basting with sauce would probably work great. :/

My husband and I really loved the taste of the brisket! I followed the recipe exactly and found the flavors to be really tasty and not over empowering at all. It was done in 6-7 hours in our new slow cooker, so next time I would take it out sooner.

Quite good, and tasty. However, was never able to "shred" the meat . . . it just never got soft enough to do so, although it was excellent just sliced thinly and served with the sauce. Did as other reviewers suggested and didn't put the sauce on until after 6 hours on low (at that point drained the meat before adding the sauce/worcestershire mixed). Then another 3 hours on LOW.

I was a bit upset after making this recipe. I love to smoke brisket on my smoker, both wood and electric.
 Now I know it's just a big waste of time!
I also chose to pull it apart and put it back in the sauce for a while. Delicious.

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and was so pleased with the outcome.  The meat was so tender and the spice was perfect.  This was my first brisket and I served it at a Super Bowl party to rave reviews.

AWESOME recipe and very easy.  The only change I made is I omitted the salt.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked the brisket for 10 hours on low and it came out fork tender and simply delicious.  We will definitely make this again!

I was looking for a bbq pulled pork recipe when I saw this recipe & decided to try it with pork.  I used a 8.5 Ibs pork butt & tripled the recepe.  It was alot of rub, but I only had to use about half of it. I didn't have any dry thyme so I used 1 tbls of fresh thyme instead.  I only used 2 cups of bbq sauce...regular Kraft works great. I cooked it on low for 16 hours, flipping once.  The pork turned out delicious & super tender!  Awesome recipe...thanks!

What an easy way to do BBQ. The whole family liked this recipe. It was a little bit spicy, will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time for the kids.

Wasn't bad, but we weren't that into it.  That being said, it might have been user error, so I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again.  I left the fat cap on the brisket, so I'm sure that helped with any dryness.  It was still in a neat strip since I cooked it with that side up, so I cut it off before shredding meat back into the sauce before serving.  I had to add the very outer edge of fat back in because that is where the spices were on that 1/2 of the meat.  Used only 2# brisket, but by accident didn't decrease the amount of rub (so that might have been problem #1).  Also accidentally forgot to rub with liquid smoke 1st before dry rub (so that might have been problem #2).  Cooked exactly in time stated.  I only used 1/2 the BBQ sauce & worst mix (which is where I wound up putting the smoke after I realized I goofed).  The flavor was pretty intense... too saucy...too spicy for the kids but they managed to eat.  I really was busy doing other things in the kitchen (canning), so this was a quick enough & simple enough way to get dinner on the table when I knew I wouldn't feel like preparing dinner after a day in the kitchen.  Like I said, it might have been a combination of factors, plus a really spicy/smoky bottled sauce... I would try again, but maybe a sweeter bottled sauce.

I made this once before and received rave reviews from my husband (not my son, but he doesn't care for spicy things) and just made it again this week and it was delicious! My husband said it is the best brisket he's ever had, including what he's had at restaurants. He bragged to the guys at work about it. He told me to "please don't ever lose that recipe"!

Hubs offered suggestions of a magazine to thumb through and friends to contact for brisket recipes while we were eating this. Less than a favourable sign.  I made this according to the recipe, and after 9 hours in the slow cooker the meat was dry, the flavour unremarkable. It was better with additional bbq sauce but not a repeater for us.

Very Tasty!! I had no worsteshire, so I used a little teriyaki..used KC bulls eye BBQ sauce..wonderful!! Wish I had used a bigger piece of meat for leftovers! In regard to the issue some folks had with spices..I marinated my cut overnite in the rub, and cooked it for the full 8 hours..the spices were very aromatic, but were not overpowering when the brisket was served. Maybe it depends on the sauce that was used?***** I made this a second time using a less expensive cut of meat, and different sauce...it was okay, but not mouthwatering like the first time. The sauce definatly makes or breaks this recipe.

This was pretty fantastic.  The only complaint I had was the barbecue sauce/worchestershire sauce mixture burned into the bottom of my crockpot.  However, this was more of a cleaning issue than anything else.  It didn't affect the flavor of the meat at all, and we didn't use it as a sauce.   I fed 12 people (with the recipe adjusted for a 4 lb. cut of meat) and all of them thought it was awesome, as well.  I couldn't ask for a more glowing review than that!

So good! I used the suggestion of another reviewer and put the liquid smoke/dry rub on the night before.  The brisket was so tender.  I will make this again but with one change, I will use about half as much cayenne pepper.  This is just a personal preference.

Tried this recipe just as instructed, spices and sauce are really good. Added extra red pepper for heat. Will go with larger brisket next time, even with lid staying closed and flipping once the 3 lb. dried out with the long cooking time, mine cooked about 6 hours on low. So next time will cut time down to 5 hours on low and 5 lb brisket, thereabouts. Overall really good, time to cook is the problem I had.

Super easy.  Bake in 250 degree oven all day (8-10 hours).  Left off the BBQ sauce and it was wonderful without it.

I made this with a 2 pound brisket, otherwise followed recipe exactly. It was excellent! Shredded beef, then stirred it back into sauce. Served on toasted slider buns.

Good stuff!!! However, I found the rub to make the brisket a little too salty for my taste. It was done in 6 hours, so I sliced it and tossed it back in under WARM. Thanks for a good recipe :)

This was really good. Everyone loved it and had seconds - husband, 11-year-old, and 7-year-old. I added extra bbq sauce because I was afraid it might not get enough moisture, but it probably would have been fine without it.

It might be my slow cooker but the cook time was much to long on this recipe.  I pulled the brisket out and while it did fall off the bone it reeked of burnt sugar.  The BBQ sauce had been cooking so long that I assume the sugar in it began to burn.  The meat tasted the same...I love brisket but will not be making this recipe again.

What did I do wrong? The directions are simple and I followed them to the word. Our brisket was tough and dry and not at all the 5 stars the rest of you achieved. It was like a piece of shoe leather. My husband has been researching crock pot temps to see if maybe our new one is too hot or something? So sad.  This is the second brisket we had turn out this way. I give up on brisket!

The brisket was delicious and had great flavor.  I marinated the beef brisket overnight and it really soaked up the flavor from the spices and liquid smoke.  Unfortunately, I added too much cayenne pepper by accident and it was a little too spicy.  I definitely would stick to the suggested amount unless you like your brisket REALLY spicy.

Followed the recipe to the letter.  First time a well rated recipe disappointed me.  The rub was overpowering for us.  No beef taste at all.  If I make again, I will cut the rub down by half, and the thyme by even more.  But why bother if I'm just stewing the brisket in BBQ sauce.

Oh my!  It smelled both smokey and like vinegar and the taste was terrible. All I can think is that the smoke flavor brand might make a difference since another rater mentioned the strong smoke flavor.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because my 14 yr old son loved it.  My husband and I on the other hand were not happy with it.  I followed the recipe exactly but the meat came out very tough (I slowcooked it on low for 8 hrs, maybe I should have tried 10) and the barbeque sauce came out with a burnt taste (KC Masterpiece Original so it was not a generic brand).  The burnt taste was not the smoke flavor it was the sugar in the sauce over caramalizing.  If we use this one again I will hold the sauce until through cooking and add broth or water in it's place while it cooks.  Luckily I got the brisket on a "use by date" sale so I did not feel I ruined an expensive piece of meat.

Shannon has a great recipe; the only change I might suggest is actually a serving option; the eight hour cooking time is fine for the recipe as written; if you cook for 10 hours, or 200 degrees, you can make some wonderful shredded brisket for buns; just use two forks to separate the meat; if necessary, you can also return it to the slow cooker and add a bit more barbeque sause, if needed.

I just made this recipe for the first time and it came out awesome! The only change I made was that I actually found a spice rub at my local spice store that had all the ingredients in it except for the cumin which I added separately to it It just made it that much easier. I did marinate it over night and cooked it all day in the slow cooker. I did add water to the BBQ sauce and worcestershire at the beginning of cooking. The sauce looked too thick to me and I was afraid of the overpowering flavor BBQ sauce sometimes can have. I think it was about a half cup of water. The result was delicious and enjoyed by my whole family. I served it with fresh made corn bread. Yum.

This is a really smart idea for brisket. Since I was in a rush Friday morning, I just went the lazy route. I used a large crock pot, added the brisket. along with 1 1/2 cups of beef broth, 4 garlic cloves, 1 T. worcestershire, 2 t. kitchen bouquet, salt and pepper. This cooked for 11 hours on low and was super delicious. Again, great idea for a brisket.

Fixed this exactly as written, and it was DELICIOUS!!  My husband and I loved it, but our 11-year old did think it was a little too spicy due to the cayenne pepper - I scraped the sauce off the meat and she gobbled it up (and she usually does not like meat or BBQ sauce). I marinated the brisket in the dry rub overnight.  DO NOT mix it with the sauce as some of the other reviewers did - it's best as a marinade to soak into the meat. I sliced the meat and placed it back into the crock pot for the last hour.  It made the meat very moist, juicy, and full of flavor. The type of BBQ sauce you use will definitely make a difference.  I used Dinosaur Original BBQ sauce (which you probably won't find unless you live in upstate NY) - it's a redder BBQ sauce, unlike Jack Daniels or KC Masterpiece which are smokier.  It was PERFECT. Thanks Shannon!

OMG! This was amazing! I made this for 2 people and we had enough leftovers for 3 days.  The only changes I made was that I used 4lbs of brisket instead of 3lbs, and kept everything else the same as the recipe calls for.  We both loved this and can't wait to make it again!

The flavor was delicious, but the meat was dry.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 9 hours but when it was served it needed a sauce or something to moisten it.

This was my first time cooking a brisket and my husband and I both thought this was an absolute winner!  The flavor of the sauce was to-die-for and the brisket was still sliceable after 8-1/2 hours.  Combined with mashed potatoes and veggie - - YUM!!  Thanks, Shannon, for a wonderful crockpot recipe.  PS:  The house smelled DIVINE while this was cooking!

I *really* enjoyed this recipe.  Basically I followed all of these steps (without doing the dry rub overnight--didn't have time) on a 3ish lbs pork roast as I couldn't find non-corned beef.  There was a little extra dry rub at the end so I just dumped it on top.  Dropped about four cloves of garlic in with the onions 'cause that's just me.  Also mixed 1/2 cup spicy Diana sauce and 1 cup regular BBQ sauce to give it a little extra umph.  Cooked for 1 hr on high, 5 more on low and 1 last hr on high to make sure it was heated through.  Tore up the pork afterward and it was wonderful!  Was eating it for days.

I usually give four stars for "pretty good," but this gets all five. Will definitely make again, maybe even for company. It was spicy, but I used "Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy" (medium-thick sweet/spicy) sauce, so that probably added to the effect. Plus I like spicy. I was just cooking for myself, so I halved the recipe. I'd read that results tend to be erratic if recipes don't fill the crockpot one-half to three-fourths full. And mine was less than one-third full when it settled, so I kept an eye on time. It was medium well after less than five hours on low. I sliced it up and put it back in on "Keep Warm" to soak up sauce for about 30 minutes. Can serve on rolls or without. We have good barbeque in Kansas City (try the original location of Arthur Bryant's (vinegary sauce) if you're in town), but this barbeque brisket definitely rates.

This recipe was okay, but be careful.  It has potential, but a few alterations are KEY.  The liquid smoke is like any other seasoning...you can always add more, but you cannot take it out!!  1/2 tsp is WAY too much.  Put in a few drops, taste it after it's cooked and if you feel it needs more, then by all means... I cut the cumin in half (again, too smokey) and make sure your BBQ sauce isn't "smokey" too (a mistake I made).  1 TBSP of paprika was a bit much...it overpowered much of the brisket.  I would make this again, but definitely make those alterations.  The only way I could eat this brisket was if I drained it as much as possible.  If I would've made those changes (above), then the juice would've been wonderful.  Hope this helps...

Love Love Love this - it was so soft and tender and flavorful... the only change I made was I chopped up two onions and layed them in the bottom of the crock pot as a bed for the meat.  So yummy especially on a cold snowy day.

This is a great recipe that's also good for company and Sunday Dinners.   The cayenne pepper does add a kick to it, which our 4 year old doesn't quite like yet, so be aware of the tastes of the diners - it's still great without the cayenne.   Be sure that you pick a barbeque sauce that you like. The brisket does take on the flavor of the sauce. If you like tang, get a tangy sauce. If you like sweet, use a sweet sauce. Either way you'll be sure to enjoy the recipe.

This was ok.  I didn't leave enough time for this one to be on low, but had to put it on high.  It was still ok, but I think it would be better if it had sat on low for 8 hours.  Everyone loved it and thought it was great.  I made two briskets today.  The other one done in the oven looked better but it might have been the cut.  Still, this was very good.

I put all ingredients except for bbq and worchestershire sauces in a giant baggie, sealed and left in the refrig overnight.  The next morning I put it all in the crock pot with about 1/4 cup water. Put the bbq sauce on the table for us to put on the meat as we ate.  This is so delicious~unreal! 

I used the leftovers, shreaded in beef enchiladas...OMG this is such an easy & delicious way to make meat!

This was the best brisket I have ever made. We were running late this morning and it took me 2 minutes to put the prepared brisket (rubbed in the liquid smoke and dry rub, placed in a ziplock) into the cooker with the worcestershire and BBQ sauce, and press the cook 10 hours button! We came back weary from an all-day swim meet to a wonderfully tender and flavorful brisket! My husband and kids loved it and I have plenty of leftovers for the week ahead. Thanks for the recipe so much. Will make again and again.

I am from Texas and have long dreamt of finding good bar-b-q in Miami, Fl (which is difficult to come by!)... well, I have to look no more for mighty good brisket!! I can make it at home now!  This was phenomenal!  I doctored it up (made it a tad bit sweeter w/ some brown sugar at the end), but made it exactly as written otherwise.  My husband was in shock at how good this was!  We served on buns w/ chopped onions and pickles and some corn-on-the-cob on the side.  Absolutely wonderful meal to come home to! Thanks so much!

I too felt the liquid smoke was too much.  I have since found a different method to get great flavor.  Simply season your meat, sear on all sides and place in slow cooker.  Add barbeque sauce, catsup and some worcheshire sauce (about 1/2 cup each).  Cook on high for one hour and reduce to low for approx. 6 or 8 hrs.  Remove meat from pot and pull apart with two forks.  After shredding, add sauce until desired consistency is achieved.  Even better the next day.

Great flavor and super moist.  I don't like cooking with liquid smoke for health reasons so for added smokey flavor I used smoked paprika in the rub.  Other than that, followed recipe as stated.  It's a keeper!

For brisket cooked inside, this was good.  I don't have a slow cooker; so I cooked covered in the oven at 275 degrees for several hours.  To me thyme is a strong spice; so I used about half of what was called for.

I love crock pot recipes and this did have the smoky flavor of brisket.  It was very tender and the whole family liked it.  It was easy and I would make it again.

We've made this at least a dozen times now - I don't use quite as much rub as suggested because otherwise it's just too spicy for me, but it still turns out amazing!

I had a nice, expensive grassfed beef brisket I didn’t know how to make. I wanted a recipe that would enhance the flavor of the meat while also delivering some barbecue-y goodness. When I opened the crock and had a taste of this, I was so disappointed. The spiciness totally overwhelmed the meat. My mouth was burning and all I could taste was spiciness. I am so irritated that I wasted a good brisket. Grassfed meat tastes delicious all by itself. I can see where if you get crappy cornfed feedlot beef from Sam's Club you might want to cover up the taste. Or maybe you love your mouth being on fire for 5 minutes and not being able to taste anything. I halved the cayenne and it still made it unbearable. I will admit that the BBQ sauce I used might have also contributed to the problem (it’s a sauce I've never had from Trader Joe's that's like KC Masterpiece, I think). The resulting brisket was salty as all getout, further obscuring the taste.  It was very tender and relatively moist, however. I think maybe this recipe might be better if the salt and cayenne was totally left out and a mild and/or honey BBQ sauce was used (esp. if the cayenne is left in). I’d have made my own sauce if I had time. I know Southerners have specific preferences in their BBQ based on their geographics, but us Midwesterners have a taste for the subdued. If I made this again, I would leave most of the BBQ sauce out and put it on the meat as desired while eating. I’d find a sub for moisture while cooking.

According to the husband, this is the best brisket I ever made.  I added seasoned salt to the rub and did not strictly measure the rest of the spices then rubbed it into both sides of the brisket after trimming all the fat off.  I also made my own BBQ sauce (ketchup, chili sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, oregano, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, red pepper flake, cayenne and the liquid smoke).  I poured the sauce over the brisket and put it in the crock pot for about 6.5 hours on low.  I make this on Sundays for the husband to take to work for lunches for the week.  He raved about this the second he came home and days after so this is a keeper for sure.  The only thing he did was add a pickle to the meal!

This was AWESOME! I put the rub on the brisket last night and put in fridge. Didn't use liquid smoke flavoring because I'm not a fan of it, but I did use Fresh & Easy Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce. My whole family loved this! Served it over mashed potatoes with some veggies on the side. Will DEFINITELY make again, probably using a larger cut of meat because we didn't have any leftovers.

this was not to our taste at all.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and followed the recipe to the letter but the entire thing is in the trash can, minus a few bites.  It had a very bitter taste and the smokiness was overwhelming.  A complete waste of a lot of food and a lot of money.  Sorry.

Obviously you can make this as spicy as you want depending on the type of BBQ sauce.  If you are counting your pennies you can buy discounted pot roast instead of brisket.  It costs half as much.   We seasoned it, put it in the crocket and then the fridge to save time in the morning.  I will definitely make it again.

The brisket was very tender. My only complaint about this recipe is that the seasoning is too much. Next time, I will reduce the seasoning, especially the thyme.

This is a great recipe. I didn't change a thing and will make it again. It was tender and flavorful. I had done briskett in the crockpot before but without using the liquid smoke. I think that is what made this recipe so much better.

The brisket was very tender but I thought there were way too many spices and it was overpowering. If I made it again I would use much less of the spices.

I followed the recipe to a T.  Cook time on low: 9.5 hours.  Recipe has potential.  Next time, I'm going to cut down on the salt and reduce cook time to maybe 7 hrs.  At 9.5, it was way too well done and dry.  I was disappointed, but partly because the 3# of brisket cost $14.  Also will add either 1/4 or 1/2 c. brown sugar to complement the savory.

This was surprisingly simple and a great brisket recipe.  My only change would be to switch cayenne to maybe chili powder or omit all toghether if your sensitive to spicy.  The fact that the meat sat on top of the sauce (and not in it) and it still came out great was a surprise.

I am so glad that someone has furnished a rub or seasoning that is not a purchased already prepared dry soup mix or a can of soup.  There are way too much preseratives, sodium, msg, etc in those for it to be healty so when I see those recipes, I have to either pass on them or make adjustments.  Thanks again for this recipe.

This was very good and very easy.  The only thing I could add was serve some extra bbq sauce with it.  The juice it cooked in was good but pretty drippy. We wanted something a little thicker.  Will make this again.

I just made this recipe. I didn't add the liquid smoke. Just not a fan of the flavor and didn't want to ruin the meat if it was overpowering. I also kept the fat on instead of trimming it. I actually love slow cooked meat w/ the fat b/c it just melts in your mouth. No not good for you, but still tasty if you don't mind the consistancy. I don't understand the reviews that said this came out burned and dry. Mine was tender and there was a ton of juice. I'll make this again. I think next time I'm going to leave out the cumin or add a little less of it.

I made this recipe as is and it was delicious.  I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce.  I shredded the beef and made sandwiches with Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes from this site as a side. I will be making this again.

I made this brisket with 3 others for a big hanukkah party. This was the first to go, my daughter and husband said it was their favorite! Pretty spicy- so good to have another type if you have some not-so-spicy eaters - like me.

The recipe as written proved too salty for us although it was tender. The second effort, in lieu of the spices, I used a BBQ rub purchased at a spice shop and did not add salt or pepper. Smoke, Worstershire and BBQ sauce remained the same. Mm-mm, FANTASTIC! A far more palatable variation for our family! 3 stars originally; 5 stars now.

Being a Texan with a husband who has been on award winning cook teams, I was VERY skeptical of a brisket cooked in a slow cooker.  Wow...amazed.  The brisket even had the "ring" around the outside.  Even my husband was impressed and everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing!  This is a keeper!

This was terrific! We don't like spicy so I Didn't use the cayenne pepper & cut the pepper in half. Since my barbecue sauce had smoke in it, I skipped the liquid smoke. I used KC Masterpiece honey smoke sauce. It took about 5 1/2 hours in my crock pot & I turned it over after about 3 hours. Easy, tender (it fell apart!) & totally delicious!!

I don't know if my slow cooker runs a little hot but I used a larger cut than called for and it was burnt on the edges after 5 1/2hours. Aside from it burning it was also dry and the flavor wasn't very good (even the parts that weren't burnt). I don't know what I did wrong but I won't be trying this recipe again. Sorry!

Here in Texas, putting a brisket in a crock pot is unheard of....but this is amazing.  I've made this a few times and the first time I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good but honestly it was a little too "hot" for the kids. So now I omit the hot pepper, add more garlic and onion, and use a honey barbecue sauce.  No matter how big the brisket is, there never seems to be left overs. Thank you

This was a very good recipe.  I changed a few things.  I was a little more liberal with the garlic and onion powder and added some rosemary.  For the barbeque sauce I used an average hickory flavored store-bought brand and added a teriyaki glaze sauce and some ground cloves.

This was wonderful!  With our son's busy baseball schedule, I'm always looking for great slow cooker meals and this one was a hit.  Thawed and rubbed down the brisket on Sunday, placed it in the slow cooker on Monday and after a long day, we came home to a great meal.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a really good recipe and soooo easy! I couldn't even slice the meat because it was falling apart. So good! the only thing I would change is to cut the thyme in half and add more liquid smoke. I will definetly keep this recipe and make it again.

This was really good! When I asked the family how many stars they'd give it, they all said "5" in unison. Can't remember the last time that happened:-) This is very easy also. I cooked a 6 pound brisket and it was done in a little over 8 hours. I'm glad I did a large brisket because the family gobbled it up. Thanks for the recipe Shannon:)

As a veteran of the Barbeque competition circuit, and winner of the 2001 Jack Daniels World Brisket Championship, I know and love good brisket. This recipe delivered the best results I've ever gotten short of an outdoor wood fired cooker.

This recipe for indoor brisket rocked using my Breville Fast Slow Pro on the slow cooker setting. Anyone having trouble getting a good result is choosing the wrong meat or slow cooker, not the wrong recipe. Ask your grocer or butcher for a brisket point. It's a 3-4# cut from the top of the brisket. You'll also hear it called the hump or the tip. Make sure your slow cooker is set on low, and isn't so oversized the sauce runs all over the bottom instead of coating the meat.

You can make and serve this in a day with very little work and it's very good. Or you want to pull out all the stops for guests or a holiday, start two days out, rubbing down the brisket with liquid smoke and spices. Leave out the cayenne if you want to make the brisket more mild. Unless the fat cap is enormous, DON'T TRIM THE FAT OFF! (It's easier and delivers better results if you trim after cooking). After rubbing, store it in a zipper bag in the fridge until the next day. On cooking day, put in the slow cooker with the sauce (use a good sauce or you're wasting your time). Cooking time depends a great deal on what kind of slow cooker you have. I'm crazy about my Breville so that's what I use, cooking on low for 6-7 hours.

Then I removed the brisket, scraped off the fa

The first time I made this I followed the recipe as written. Excellent. The second time I made this I couldn't find Beef Brisket so I used Tri Tip instead. It too was very good but the Beef Brisket is better.

Delicious, however watch out for the heat.  We love spicy foods but this was way too spicy. Next time I will reduce the black and cayenne peppers by half. Other than that it was wonderful and even my pickiest child ate it all up. I slow cooked it for about 7 1/2 hours  then shred it and cooked it for about another 45 minutes. It turned out very tender.

I used Kosher Salt . . . was just fine. I used a "smokey" bbq sauce. Brisket is very costly for what it is . . .an inferior cut of beef. Used a blade/ mock roast. Otherwise all ingredients as called for, but mixed them in the BBQ sauce. Pre-heated the crock pot while prepping. 1 hr on low, 2 hrs on high, then 3 more hrs on low. Sliced thin, ladled sauce over meat. Meal was "to die for" tender.  Not dry at all

I had a 2.25 lb Beef Brisket so I didn't need to use all the Rub.  However, I found that 1/2 TSP of Liquid Smoke only covered 1/2 the Meat, so I used another 1/2 TSP on the other side.  Also, the only BBQ Sauce I had is a North Carolina Sauce which is thinner and has more Spice and Vinegar than most common varieties. I only had about 3/4 cup so I used that.  The Roast sat on top of the sauce in the Slow Cooker (I used my Ninja) and it worked out fine, there was plenty of sauce and moisture when it was done.  The Brisket easily shredded apart with 2 forks and I shredded it into the sauce to serve.  The flavor is wonderful and it carries quite a kick... That could be due to the BBQ Sauce I used.  Check out my pics!  I have dinner rolls to serve it on, but was craving it on a soft Flour Tortilla with some chopped lettuce to cool it down a bit.  It is divine!

Hey, this was great!  Yes, I had to tweak it some, but still....awesome!  Our butcher's smallest brisket was 6 pounds, far too much for my husband and I.  So, she recommended a flank steak instead.  Used that, and at two pounds, it was plenty.  For the tweaking, kept all the seasoning amounts the same, mixed them all up together, but only used two-thirds the amount (since I was using two-thirds the amount of meat the recipe called for).  Then, I put just under 1/4 tsp of the liquid smoke, as I listened to the other reviewer who said the smokiness overpowered the dish.  I then rubbed the smoke and spices all over the meat and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  Whacked it in the crock pot the next morning for BBQ sandwiches for dinner.  We just finished it and it was fantastic!  Will be keeping this one in the recipe box, for sure! :-)

Simple preparation and flavorful! The brisket surprisingly held its shape (unlike most Crockpot meats that fall apart); I was expecting it to be a bit more tender.

I thought this was wonderful! It had a nice tang to it; I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce which I've always loved, and I think the liquid smoke, worchestershire, and rub melded nicely and gave the meat an excellent flavor that made wonderful sandwiches (I put sharp cheddar cheese on top of the meat and seared the buns on the griddle). I will definitely make this recipe again. Thank you for sharing!

Not impressed. Maybe its because we have excellent brisket everywhere here in Texas. I'm wondering whatever possessed me to cook a brisket in a crock pot. We have other favorite crock pot recipes that we will be sticking with.

This a fabulous and easy brisket!  I've made it several times now, and it's always been a success.  I love how simple it is to just dump everything in the slow cooker and forget about it.  It is a bit spicy, so if you're sensitive to spiciness, you might want to cut the cayenne in half.  Other than that, it's great as is.

Really delicious!  I followed another reviewer's advice and let the meat marinate in the liquid smoke & dry rub overnight.  (The rub makes enough to do the recipe twice.)  Just popped it in the crock pot and yum!

I need a 4 1/2 stars.  So, so easy.  Recipe is perfect exactly as is (or half the cayenne if you don't like spicey).  You just don't need to mess with it.  It took every fiber of my being not to flip it at some point, but I left it alone.  Glad I did.  For a 3.5 lb brisket, 8 hours exactly was perfect.  Some of us chopped it up for sandwiches, the rest of us ate it sliced.  Whatever you like.  The sauce was perfect for cooking and giving it flavor, but the fat from the brisket made it a bit thin for serving.  If I was a better cook, I would know how to fix that.  HIGHLY recommend preparing the meat with the liquid smoke and spices the night before, and wrapping in plastic wrap.  Not only does it give the spices time to flavor the meat better, it makes for an easy morning.  Just throw in the sauce, throw in the meat, and you're on with your day.

I used Jack Daniels No 7 BBQ Sauce for this, and a dry smoke rub for this.  This is the easiest, best brisket I have ever made.

I did try it.  I don't like liquid smoke, so didn't use that.  I couldn't find as big a brisket as the recipe needed, so that may have been part of the problem (mine was 2.33 pounds), but I don't think I like the flavor of thyme.  It was also a little spicier than I wanted, again maybe due to the size of the meat.  Wouldn't do it again.

This was just ok for us.  I cooked it for 10 hours and was shocked it did not shred easily.  With briskets, I usually slice and maybe that is what I should have done here.  I usually use a a chuck roast for this type of thing.  I think the bbq sauce I used must have been vinegar based too.  I like it on its own but not cooked down.  I also thought I would get a much more smoky flavoring from the liquid smoke and didn't.  I thought I would regret putting the 1/4 teaspoon on both sides but it was totally lost on the dish.  I might possibly up that from the 1/2 t called for on the recipe. I wonder what if I would have liked this better just cooking it with the rub and adding the sauce towards the end or upon serving.

Just made this tonight, it really was delicious. My only problem was that it came out a bit dry. My brisket was first cut (already lean to begin with), just under 3lbs, and I cooked it on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours exactly. Next time I will use second cut for a juicer result. The flavour was fantastic (I used Diana Sauce, honey garlic) and I can't wait to have it in a challah roll for lunch tomorrow! I also seared the sides in a bit of oil prior to putting it in the slow cooker, made for some really nice edges!

This came out awesome! I followed the recipe exactly as is, although my cut of brisket was closer to two pounds (I made the full amount of rub, but didn't quite use all of it - I did still use the full amount of sauce). Boyfriend LOVED it, we were both pretty impressed with my first attempt. I'd never had brisket before and wasn't sure what to expect, but this was delish!

Edit: This also made awesome sandwiches the next day - I just shredded the meat, warmed it up and had it on bulkie rolls.

Mine was fairly dry.  The sauce was tangy and formed a nice coating on the outside.  The meat certainly fell apart easily.

We are retired and live in Costa Rica where the beef is grass fed, almost no fat. This recipe is awesome for us. No trimming and done just as Shannon suggests. Marinating over night really adds to the flavor and ease of preparing, pop it in the cooker at 4AM and it is ready for a truly awesome lunch. Thanks Shannon for a really great BBQ.

This was excellent!  We put more liquid smoke in than called for, and it did not overpower the meat. In fact, i would have preferred it slightly smokier.   Next time, I will put less cayenne in, as it was too spicy for my 7 year old.

This was very good.  I left out the worcestershire sauce.  I cooked the brisket with barbeque sauce.  Then when it was done, I shredded the meat and added more barbeque sauce till it looked the way I wanted.  I served this on outdoor rolls.  Was very good!

This was delicious, the meat was so moist & tender! We found it a little spicy so next time I'll leave out the cumin. I didn't put the liquid smoke directly on the meat but rather mixed it in with the sauce. Served with Roasted Green Beans With Peppers & Onion from Kraft recipes. Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good recipe.  Sauce was very flavorful and meat was tender.  Next time I will try to braise in the oven to get rid of that "crock pot taste".   Will make again

Oh man, this super easy recipe nailed the BBQ flavor! It was also awesome to leave the house at 8:00 a.m. for a busy day knowing that I'd already prepared the birthday dinner I was serving in the evening. Once I got home, I only had about 10 minutes of work left shredding the meat and toasting the buns. It was a big hit.

Followed recipe exactly.  Took one bite and could  eat no more.  It had a strange bitter taste.  I admit to being picky about food, but I would nevrer serve this to a guest.  Or, maybe I am just used to eating the excellent smoked brisket that is readily available here in Texas.

We all love this.  I cook it all day in the slow cooker (Usually about 10-12 hours on low then 1 on high, but I buy a HUGE brisket).  After it is tender, I take it out, shred it, drain off whats in the bottom of the crockpot (I cook it with the fat on), then put the beef back in and add my own bbq sauce then just warm it back up.   It's fabulous.

First time to make brisket and I'm so glad to have chosen this recipe.  It was great!  I made it as written spice-wise but the brisket was just over 2.5 lbs.  I think to use that size I will cut the thyme to 1 teaspoon as it was a little strong for the smaller cut.  Took half the brisket from crockpot at 7 hrs to serve sliced and let the other half cook another hour or so and 'pulled' it for sandwiches the next day.  Just delicious.  served with Texas Slaw, recipe from this site.  Yum, yum!

Followed this recipe exactly - I was hesitant about the amount of cayenne pepper but decided to try it as written. VERY spicy, even for my husband who has a much higher tolerance level than I do. I could adjust it but I'm not sure the ratio of the remaining spices worked either. I think I'd put in more cumin and less thyme, to start. Regardless, great starter idea for me as far as the liquid smoke and BBQ sauce. Will use as an idea but create my own spice rub.

This turned out so good! I was a little concerned as it cooked throughout the day because it smelled so spicy! But by the end of the 8 hours, the smell was not so strong, and it tasted amazing! Even my picky daughter ate it, and that's saying something! My DH and I ate these on a sub bun, and he threw a little of mozzarella cheese on his. The only change I made was replacing the onion powder with a quartered small onion because I didn't have any. I put some on the below the brisket and some on top. Thanks for submitting this!

I personally think that anyway you make brisket is good. This was my first brisket and I was BLOWN AWAY! It was EASY, and DELICIOUS. The only think I changed was I omitted the liquid smoke because I didn't have any. Perfect as is. Thank you for a delicious easy recipe. I will make this again for sure!

This was my first attempt at making a brisket.  Overall we liked it.  The meat was very tender and the preparation was very simple.  We thought the flavor was a bit strong though and some of our kids would not eat it because it was too spicy.  If you like tender brisket with a bite, then this is the receipe for you.

This is my first recipe in my brand new slow cooker. I was so surprised how soft and tender the meat was at the end, I liked the flavor but I found it a little bit strong for the kids and my self. So what I did was cook white rice adding to the water one tbsp of lemon juice and serve the beef over leaves of lettuce. YUM!

This is a really good recipe.  I've made it a couple of times and the meat just falls apart.  I really like that it has a bit of a kick to it, makes it different than most roast recipes.  The only thing I do different is I pour the bbq sauce and Worchshire on top of the roast instead of putting it in on the bottom of the crock pot.  I added potatoes and carrots last time and they turned out really good as well.

My husband loved this. It is all dependent on the BBQ Sauce you use. I chose to use Spicy BBQ sauce and that plus the combination of all the seasonings made it too spicy for me to even eat more than a bite. Will try again with different sauce.

Pretty good and pretty easy and pretty hot.  I couldn't believe how hot it turned out!  I followed the recipe, exactly.  I also thought it was overcooked.  I probably should have watched it; my crockpot cooks hot.  Anyway, probably not something I would make again but not too bad for a "busy day".

We liked this brisket, although it was a little too salty. Next time we make cut the seasons in half to take away so much of the salty taste. I loved though that my whole family ate it, and I picked the recipe in the morning and didn't need any extra trips to the store to get all the ingreadients-- it was all very common and simple spices needed. We will make this again.

Wow what a great find! This was the first time I have ever made brisket. I have been looking for good crock pot recipes and hadn't found anything really outstanding until now. I would give this a 10 if I could. Can't wait to make this again. I had a 4 pound brisket and had plenty of rub and sauce. Served with buttery potatoe rounds and steamed vegetables YUM!!

UPDATE: SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH GIVING A RECIPE A SECOND TRY. :) I USED JACK DANIEL'S ORIGINAL BBQ SAUCE THIS TIME AND ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW! I ALSO SLICED MY BRISKET (OPPOSED TO SHREDDING IT) AND I LIKED IT MUCH BETTER THIS WAY. PAIRED WITH CHEESY RANCH POTATOES, THIS WAS A SERIOUSLY GOOD (AND EASY!) MEAL - WITH NO LEFTOVERS!!! This was an "OK" brisket. I prefer my BBQ sirloin recipe just a tad better tho... My bf really liked this, but for me, this was just so-so (I think I disliked the sauce I used, which can be easily altered by choosing a different one). Because I couldn't find a single 3 lb. brisket, I purchased 2 (1.5 lb.) ones and placed them side by side in my slow cooker. I used Famous Dave's original recipe sauce which ended up being too sweet for me (and the reason I didn't care for this). :( I pretty much followed Shannon's recipe to a T except for forgetting to trim the fat from my brisket (only one of them had any fat layer anyways), but this wasn't problematic in the least. When everything was done, I easily removed all of the fat (and my sauce was fine - not greasy at all). Served on onion rolls with bread & butter pickles / onion and a side of baked beans (by MEANJEANNE - also on this site). Thanks for sharing!

I'm from Texas and now live in AZ.  I was looking for a brisket recipe to cook for the Fall football season.  This recipe is wonderful.  My husband is a big "meat" guy and found this recipe perfect.  I did add a little more cayenne pepper and use "Woody's" bbq sauce.  I also use Emeri's original seasoning instead of paprika.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours and then added about 1/4 cup water... let it sit on warm for about 3 more hours.  Fantastic.  Great recipe.

BBQ Brisket is an excellent recipe.  I had to use flank instead of brisket, but it worked out beautifully.  I am definitely going to make this again.  We had company over and it all disappeared with rave reviews.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was awesome!  Very flavorful and tender, served it with homemade cole slaw, baked beans, honey cornbread, and sliced cantaloupe - Put it together really fast in the a.m., and it was ready to go after 8 hours on low.  Wouldn't change a thing, and will definitely be making this again - everyone in my family loved it!

Excellent!  The only change I made was to add about 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce when cooking.  I cut the brisket in 4 pieces. When cooked, I removed the chunks of meat and cooled slightly before shredding with 2 forks and discarding the fat. I added the shredded meat back into the sauce after I'd skimmed the fat off and cooked for another 1/2 hour.  I served on English muffins, but sourdough hogie rolls would have been great too.

This was OUTSTANDING. My lowly bottled BBQ sauce ended up tasting like something from a BBQ joint when mixed with the meant juices and seasonings. My entire family loved it, and it was so easy. Thanks for a fantastic crock pot recipe!

All the spices overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.  I think it might have been better to use just a bottle of really good bbq sauce, some garlic & onion powder and paprika and a touch of cayenne.  Forget all the other ingredients, especially the liquid smoke.

This is such a yummy and easy rub! I used it on a boston butt and the only thing I would change is to add a little more liquid smoke but other than that it is great! I also used the homeade sauce from the recipe Barbequed Beef Brisket instead of this one for a little more depth :-) It was great too!

Served at 4th of July cookout; was well received. Followed Nanna Pat's recommended method of searing first, which always makes meat more flavorful and appealing. Was nice & tender. Will leave out the cumin next time.

This was very tasty. My parents came in from out of town and my mom asked me for the recipe afterwards, so it has to be good! Before serving, I did cut it up into chunks and mixed it around some, then left it in the crockpot for another 1/2 hour.

Did not make any changes and should have put rub on and left it in the fridge overnight. However, cooked a 4 lb roast for 10 hours on low and came out oh, so tender. Delicious!! Will make again!!

I have made this brisket many times, following the recipe exactly. I have marinated on occasions and gone without on others. It’s great either way but if you have the time, I would recommend marinating before. I have trimmed the fat before but most recently, just leave it on and cook fat side up. It has never been dry or tough as some have stated, however I always buy a nice cut of meat, usually from Whole Foods. I suppose people who really dislike spice might not like this recipe as it can have a bit of a kick. Obviously, the bbq sauce you choose will have an affect on that as well. I like to mix it up and try a different one each time. I have received nothing but rave reviews from my picky husband as well as all of our family and friends who have tried it (at least 10) and have had multiple people ask for the recipe.

The only change that I made was to use Chipotle powder, instead of the Cayenne Pepper. The Chipoltle adds a nice bit of heat and a touch more smokiness. I don't like thee bite/taste of Cayenne. The recipe is simple and easy to make. Makes great sandwiches?!

First of all thank you for this recipe. It was extremely easy and very tasty indeed.

The only change I made was I had about a 4lb. brisket but still followed the recipe as is. 

I made up the dry rub the night prior to cooking and applied it and wrapped it tightly in saran wrap for the night. The next morning I mixed the liquid seasonings and poured it into my crock pot. While I was doing this I had pulled the wrapped up, dry rubbed brisket out and let it breath a little and let it warm a little.

After 20 minites I tossed the meat in fat side up on top of this "bbq sauce" mixture. I set the cooker to warm for another 20 minutes, then went in and bumped it up to low and left it there for 7.5 hours without touching it.

At that point I pulled the brisket out onto a baking sheet and let it rest about 15-20 minutes then sliced the entire thing up and stuck it back into the pot for another hour on warm while we made our sides.

We absolutely loved this. It was a little much black pepper for me, but when paired with a nice sweet cream corn dish I got from here it blended perfectly.

Did not care for this. I followed the recipe exactly. I felt like the sauce was too overpowering, and even with trimming the brisket, it was too greasy.

One of our favorites - even better than the brisket my mother used to make! Tip for some reviewers: the success of this recipe is the method. The proper ratio of liquid to meat is the key to success of slow cooker cooking. But spices are just a guideline! Don't condemn the entire recipe because you don't like the smoky flavor: adjust it or eliminate it. There are no recipe police!

I really liked the flavor of this. After it cooked for about an hour I couldn't resist it any longer and chopped an onion to spread over it for the rest of the cooking time. As much as I liked I still have to admit I prefer the brisket I smoke on my charcoal grill. What I really want to do with this recipe is try it on a pork shoulder and I'm sure I will.  Soon.

I made this with an 8lb brisket and cooked it in the oven at 325 for 5 hours.  I seasoned the meat and let it sit in the frig for 1 hour.  We also had an injection kit for garlic and herbs that we put into the meat.  I put a little water in a roasting pan and then placed the meat on top and covered it for 4 hours.  The last hour I put bbq on top and uncovered.  It was soooo tender. Would make again.

Great easy recipe, loved it served over grits.  After reading some of the reviews, I cut the spices by 1/2 and it was plenty spicy for us.

Very yummy. I would personally use a little less of the bottled barbecue sauce because that flavor slightly overpowered the spices in the rub.

Meh, mine turned out to be spicy boiled beef as written.  The “rub” might as well be mixed in with the bbq sauce, as it doesn’t form a crust.  I knew it wouldn’t because of the liquid, but applying a rub on bbq meat makes one think of a nice crust/bark.  There was also too much tang (used kraft smokey bbq sauce) & not enough sweetness for my taste.  If I did try it again, I’d definitely sear the meat first & add some brown sugar to sweeten the sauce some.  For now, I’ll probably just  stick to my slow bake oven recipe & method.

Let me start off by saying I cook a lot and I ONLY use Allrecipes for my recipes. They're consistently good and I feel the reviews are always spot on, especially when it comes to tweaks. With that said, this...was horrible. I bought a ~3.75lb piece of brisket and trimmed it way down. Did everything else exactly as written. The meat came out so overdone and tough I ended up throwing half of the $18 brisket in the trash. The other half was barely edible after drowning it in sauce.

Very good... although it was more like a pot roast flavor than a brisket.

As a side note, we had a little left over and mixed it (shredded) with refried beans and salsa. Heated it... then topped with shredded cheddar cheese and served with tortilla chips. 

Maybe enjoyed it more this way than as a main dish.

This brisket was delicious! I cut down the recipe because I only wanted to make a pound of brisket (for 2 people). I didn’t have onion powder so omitted that, but everything else was the same. I cooked on low for 10 hours. I was worried it looked a little dry because brisket wasn’t covered in sauce, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we ate it - it was perfect and the sauce and spices were delicious. 1 pound was good for us because I don’t have a huge appetite, but might not be enough food for 2 people with bigger appetites.

Very tender after cooking in the crockpot on low for 10 hours for a 4 lb. brisket. But, next time I will definitely go lighter on the spices as the taste way way too hot for my family’s preference. Other than that, I would recommend it.

I was pretty skeptical about this because I've never heard of brisket being made in a crock-pot and my husband said it was going to ruin it.  I loved the smoked flavor and it was moist and delicious! Made him a believer. Thank you for sharing!

I was very disappointed in this recipe (I don't think I've found ANY recipes on this web site that I would rank 4 or 5 stars).  I gave it an "OK" (3 stars) because it was edible, but it was extremely dry.  It didn't come out anything like the BBQ'd beef brisket that I've had out at restaurants (i.e. BBQ joints), or at the baseball game.  What a shame/waste for such an expensive cut of meat!  Also, I put the spice rub on it and let it set overnight, like they recommended...

I mixed all the spices into a basic, store bought BBQ sauce, added a bit of brown sugar, sliced some onions, threw it all in the crock pot for 10 hours and let the magic happen. This was delicious and an easy way to have BBQ brisket without sweating.

For the small amount of effort it takes, you cannot beat this brisket. I followed the suggestion in the magazine and only 
used 2 tsp of dried thyme and thought it was perfect.

The only thing I did differently was to sear it after putting the rub on.  I've found that searing beef before cooking in a crockpot is a must.  It seals in the juices and the meat does not dry out and is always more flavorful.  Most definitely worth the extra step.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is great. Of course I have my own advice. First I cut most of the fat of my 12 lb brisket then in half. Half now half frozen. I cooked one just as the recipe said with a homemade bbq sauce. 
Weeks later I cooked the frozen one... I put it in the crockpot frozen on high for an hour then flipped and cooked one more hour.  Then I sprinkled dry rub on both sides(added seasoned meat tenderizer)  minced garlic,  liquid smoke and one can of  French Onion Campbell's soup(no water) and cooked for another hour on each side. Then I put the pot on low and cooked for another hour on each side until tender. It was moist not dry. I think starting from frozen kept it hearty and not dry.

I followed the recipe with accurate measurements.  My brisket was 2.75 lbs before trimming the fat. I used Stubb's Original BBQ sauce.  It cooked for about 8.5 hours on low.  I didn't enjoy how it turned out. It was very spicy.  The taste was not appetizing, the black pepper and vinegar of the sauce was too overpowering.  If you make this, I recommend leaving out the black pepper and cayenne.  Also use a sweet bbq sauce and add it at the end.

Yum! I took a few reviewers advice and cooked this for roughly 5 hours on low, and the meat was delicious, tender and moist. Most of my slow cooker beef starts to dry out but not this one. Will use again.

Excellent recipe; didn't change a thing, other than adding a lil extra liquid smoke. A great recipe for a smaller cut of brisket, that won't work on the grill anyhow, but you still "want a taste" (mine was approx. 2lbs). It's a new "family favorite."

The day I made this recipe was so busy that  when I realized my local grocery store had no briskets available, I had to use a different cut of meat and it still turned out awesome.  I used a standard chuck roast (probably a lot cheaper than the brisket) it was extremely tender, very flavorful, and a new staple in our household.  Other than the cut of meat, I pretty much followed the recipe to a T.  I'm assuming that no matter how closely you follow the recipe, the type of BBQ sauce you use will end up having a lot to do with it.  So I decided to use a triple pronged approach:  Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, and Stubbs sauces all went into it.  Everyone that ate it was happy.  And I was happy for those that didn't eat it so I could eat more :)

I didn't have any liquid smoke, but it tasted great without it. Dry rub was fun to make with kids. Prep was so easy. We made it in the AM and then just let it cook all day while I went to work. Came home to a great meal. This was so easy!

i didn't have all those individual spices so i used tony chachere's and cumin instead, and it was perfect. my husband went so far as to say it was the best meat he's ever had. not just the best brisket or best thing i've cooked but the best *meat* ever!

I made slight alterations to the recipe when I made it; leaving out the thyme, cayenne, and cumin because I didn't have any handy. I'm sure it would have enhanced the flavor even more, but even without those ingredients, it was delicious! It was an instant favorite for my family.

Spices are way too over powering & not enough meat.  My 1st time to cook brisket. Next time I'll buy double the brisket  size in order to yield more meat.

Would be better with a roast, as opposed to beef brisket.  With thyme tossed into the seasoning, it's a little overpowering of the cumin.  Reminded me of a pot roast flavor.

I did not use liquid smoke (personal preference).  Despite cooking it for the lower time listed, this still was dry and over cooked. The spice rub was quite good but the barbecue sauce took on an almost burnt quality after all the cooking.  Probably will not make again.

Turned out pretty good!  Used  BBQ sauce from Allrecipes 'Brisket with barbeque sauce' which was amazing as I didn't want to use bottled BBQ sauce.  Followed 'Cookingforfun' #1 review for this recipe where I marinated it in the dry rub overnight, cooked in the crockpot for 10 hours.  Neither recipe addressed whether to cook fat side up or down which I researched (my first time cooking brisket), so cooked fat side down for about seven hours and fat side up for about two hours. Added the fantastic BBQ sauce the last hour or so.  The result was good but my brisket was not so much fork tender which I had hoped for but still good.   Might cook fat side up for longer next time.  Made exactly as directed for the dry rub and did not find the thyme over powering or the cayenne hot in the least. Still trying to decide if I liked the dry rub but can't think of anything I didn't like so probably good there!  Really enjoyed making this recipe and thank you!

I wanted to try something different and ran across this recipe. This recipe was not good at all. I followed the recipe exactly and after 8 hours of slow cooking, the brisket tasted burned and it was extremely hot.  I never tasted a brisket like this before. I had to rise the brisket off with hot water to remove the taste and brushed it with a store bought BBQ sauce in order for me and my family to eat it.

I followed the recipe on everything except adding the bbq sauce, I kept it out on the side for people to add on top if wanted. I have had trouble in the past with bbq sauce burning or becoming sludge like when cooked too long. I added the worcesteshire to the bottom of the pot and put the rubbed meat on top. I doubled the recipe for Hanukkah and everyone loved it.

I made this tonight, entire family (all picky eaters) loved it! I omitted the BBQ because we wanted to try something different and it turned out great!  I put the dry rub on the meat (1.5 lbs brisket, changed recipe accordingly) then added liquid smoke and worcestershire sauce to the crock pot,  and cooked it on low for 6 hours. 

To finish off, I toasted slider buns under the broiler and added cole slaw on top of the shredded meat for moisture.  

Perfect sandwich even sans BBQ!

Hands down the best brisket ever. I found that Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 BBQ sauce is the best one to use (after trying several), and not too much liquid smoke as it can overpower the flavor.

I did not use the smoke flavoring (since I've never used it and don't have any).  I liked the tenderness of this meat.  I also liked the fact that I could add all the ingredients in the morning, leave it all day, and come home to dinner!  It was good.  Next time I will add the smoke flavoring.

What a disappointment. This was awful. It was way too spicy, and I like spice! The liquid smoke made it even worse. The meat was dry and unappealing. What a waste of a nice piece of meat.

Wow, this was a really big hit with my family!  I did not have liquid smoke so I used Hickery Smoked salt in place of the liquid smoke and regular salt.  I also let the rub marinate on the meat overnight.

As with other reviewers, I strongly recommend following the recipe exactly.  So when it says to put the slow cooker on "low" it means "low".  Mine was on high, I forgot about it, and was only able to salvage 3 servings of meat from the center (on a positive note, the outer edges made good, jaw-working jerky).  But wow, was that a tantalizing little bit in the center... Definitely a do-over.

Wow! When this came in I knew I had to try it and I was NOT disappointed! The smell of it cooking drove me crazy all day...mouthwatering! I would absolutely make this again. Next time I may use a little less pepper but otherwise it was AWESOME! I'm thinking or premixing the rub and keeping it on hand for next time to make it even quicker!

I have never given a recipe on this site 1 star, because I usually don't even try something if it doesn't get at least 4 stars from other reviewers.  However, this recipe was a huge disappointment.  I have gone over everything several times to see if I made a mistake somewhere, but cannot find anything I did differently than the recipe indicates.  Not a single person in my family liked this and we did something we almost never do, we actually just threw it away.  Perhaps just personal preference, but I cannot recommend this recipe.

Well I followed the recipe exactly.  I found and find Brisket very stringy and tough.  The flavor is great but the cut of meat is not my choice.  I will choose a different cut  of meat when making this again. Three stars for flavor of the sauce.

OMG! Tender and juicy. My husband was in the bed and i dropped the crock pot insert and he came to check on me. Saw the meat and tasted a small piece he stated it was good. He left the kitchen and came right back for another small piece. Thanks Shannon

Very flavorful, I thought there spices were very over powering. With that said it was a 50/50 split in my house, my hubby and my daughter loved it, while my son and I didn't care for it. I might make it again but would cut all of the seasonings in half.
the meat was extremely tender and very jucy!

I made this for my family and they loved it. I didn't change anything I made just as it's written. I however wasn't that fond of it but since it was great for them I'll make it again

we had this for dinner tonight and gave it 4 thumbs up! Will definitely be making this again. I made my own bbq sauce without sugar and served it with roasted vegetables. Very yummy!!

After reading all the great reviews I chose this brisket recipe to try. Followed the recipe and did not change a thing. The house just smelled like BBQ sauce, that's it. Cooked it for 8hrs, and the brisket was dry as a bone, no juices at all.  Had to smother it in sauce to make it edible.  Will not trust the ratings on this site again.  Total disappointment.

Wow. This was so flavorful and easy! I prepped the meat at 10am and dinner was ready by 6pm. The spice rub has an exotic flavor - not your traditional-tasting brisket, but a much-welcomed alternative! Delicious.

This had good flavor, but could be enhanced by the choice in barbeque sauce. Substituted chicken breasts for the brisket and served as sandwiches.

We were very pleased with this brisket recipe! Be sure to cut off as much fat as possible. We thought we had it cut down pretty good, but in the end the meat was just sitting in fat and we couldn't use it as a sauce.

i took this to a family picnic, and it was a great success. Since i have never worked with brisket i wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely being added to my list of standby's. I cooked it the night before, and left it in the fridge until and hour before eating it, with it being cold, it was very easy to slice into thin pieces which i put back into the warmed sauce, and we served it on buns.... lovely!

WOW...delicious!  Incredibly fork-tender, spiced wonderfully! I left out the cayenne for our family - otherwise made the recipe as written. Served with sweet potato fries and salad - delightful! Will most definitely be a regular this summer!

This was really good. My little tester (5yr old daughter) gave this an immediate thumbs up when she tasted it for me. The only changes i made were to use fresh thyme and i used 2 different kinds of bbq sauce since i didnt have enough for 1 1/2 cups of one kind.

I am from Texas and we know a good brisket and I thought this was pretty good.  My husband thought it was great though, the best he's ever had.  So we will definatly have this again.

I have never had BBQ brisket before but my boyfriend made a special request for it, so I decided to try this recipe. It was absolutely delicious! He is from the south, and apparently his family used to make this every Sunday. He said it was even better than theirs. He has since asked me to make it several times. It's so easy because you throw everything in the slow cooker in the morning, and leave it all day. You come home to the most wonderful aroma! Thank you!

This was ok, but definately not what I'd call barbeque.  The flavor was too much "cuminy". I dont imagine making it again.

Perfect recipe, made just as it's written. No adjustments are needed. I bought at 3.47lb brisket which was probably right at 3lbs after I trimmed the excess fat. Right about hour #6 in the slow cooker on low it started to fall apart and was perfect by the 8th hour. This is definitely a family favorite!

What did I do wrong?  I thought that this was too spicy, and over seasoned.  Maybe next time I will cut the cayenne in half,along with the pepper.  I guess I am used to a sweeter BBQ.  I can't say that it was not tender.

This was really good but maybe a little too spicy for my taste. I will use less cayenne powder next time. But the meat was very tender and had great flavor!
This one is a keeper.

Our family found this recipe mouthwatering.  I did however cook in the oven rather than the slow cooker.  My brisket was 5 lbs. I first cooked it at 350 for one hour then reduced it to 300 for 2 hours.  Fell apart and oh so good.

I had a little trouble finding a brisket that wasn't already prepared for corned beef, they are not the same.  I made this recipe for a crowd of people last weekend and received rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  I will definitely make this one again.

As easy as this is to make, it's amazing how good it tastes.  I've tried it with two different cuts of meat (a brisket and a silverside) and it was great with both.  I will probably cut the cayenne in half next time, but that's because my wife is not a spicy food lover.

I made this recipe last weekend on a Sunday.  This was the best brisket I have ever tasted.  The spice rub was just spicy enough to add a nice zing to the flavor of the meat.  I did leave the spices on overnight.  The meat was so tender and delicious.  This has definitely become a new family favorite.

This recipe gave the meat great flavor and was super easy to make.  I just threw it in the crock pot on high for about 5 hours.  It was used the next day on sandwiches and also in my salad.

This was a GREAT way to fix brisket, and it smelled absolutely yummy all day long!  But it's just a tad bit spicy for our taste buds (as written), so next time I'll probably follow some other readers suggestion and cut the cayene and cumin in half.  But it is MUCHO easy!

The brisket came out nice.  Personally, I liked the spices, but the kiddos thought the sauce was a bit spicy.

I would give this recipe 3 stars and my husband would give it 5 stars.  So we rated it 4 stars.  I thought there were too many spices going on and it tasted a bit smokey for me, but my husband (and my one year old) loved it.

The best I have tasted of home made.  A little spicy but flavors mellow with age.

Excellent flavor and easy to throw together. I added 1 sliced onion, but the aroma of all the rub spices was amazing.
