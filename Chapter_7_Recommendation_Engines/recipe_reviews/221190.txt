This recipe was a total surprise for me.  I have made chocolate covered matzoh for years, but not with this type of recipe.  Mine was plain old matzoh, coated with chocolate.  This is more of a toffee/chocolate covered matzoh and it was well worth it to give it a try.  It is delicious and easy to make.

Identical to the recipe I made years ago but this is enough for an entire box of matzoh, not just 4 boards. 
Also, try sprinkling vietnamese cinnamon on the buttered boards before adding the chocolate chips. I also recommend checking the matzoh at 7 - 10 minutes, don't wait for 15.

**** Do NOT use egg matzoh! I just tried it and very disappointed. Stick to plain, white flour matzoh for best results.

So easy! Took less than 20 minutes.  Love this recipe! Had tons of matzoh I got free from market - what do you do with Matzoh (not being Jewish?).  Popped back in oven to melt chocolate quicker. 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar covers 5 sheets matzoh.

This recipe is great and everyone LOVES it when I make it!!! I must not spread the butter and sugar as thick as other people do because I can spread it on 8 sheets of matzo rather than just 4.  Just after spreading the melted chocolate chips, we add toppings like crushed peanuts, sprinkles, and other nuts.
