HELPFUL HINTS NOT MENTIONED: I'm really giving this 5*'s because of the dressing.  It's been something I've made for almost a year now & I always have a batch ready to use.  I use soy milk or lactaid because the expiration date for the milk tend to be a month away from the day I bought it which means the dressing lasts longer!  I take a lock-n-lock & double the ingredients for the dressing.  Mix everything but the poppy seeds (or sesame seeds) b/c they tend to just stick to the lid or bottom, so you never get the portion you want.  Instead I just sprinkle it over the actual salad (any works) when I'm ready to serve, and give my lock n lock a shake before pouring over the salad!  I prefer using Almond Accents found in salad section because they're already toasted, sliced, and have different flavors. Also sprinkle cranraisins or dried blueberries along with fresh strawberries.  Delish!

I was hugely disappointed after reading all the great reviews.  I find the dressing extremly sweet, and I normally like things slightly sweet.  Will not make again.

This is a very yummy salad! Two hearts of romaine and about half a 9oz. bag of spinach was just right for me. I think most of the yumminess is in the dressing - the salad itself is very simple (even simpler when I picked all the onions off my serving!). I followed reviewer suggestions to reduce the mayo to 1/3 c. and the poppy seeds to just 1 Tbsp, then used a full 3 Tbsp. of red wine vinegar. Really tasty like that, but I was serving this at a baby shower for twin girls, so I wanted a pinker hue than the vinegar alone could give. I tossed in 3-4 frozen raspberries that I happened to have on hand and shook the you-know-what out of it until they just completely dissolved! Much pinker, and even tastier. ** Added later: I just tried a little of the dressing drizzled over a bowl of leftovers from the fruit tray (cantaloupe, honeydew, red grapes & strawberries). An unusual but very yummy way to enjoy both! ** Even later: I made a quick version with just leftover spinach, sliced strawberries and the dressing. I did not miss the romaine, but even though I didn't actually eat the onions last time, I missed the hint of flavor that they added. Don't skip them!

Very good--even without all the required ingredients (I didn't have spinach or onion).  The dressing was so much better than any store-bought one!!  I used red wine vinegar instead of white, which gave the dressing a slight pinkish color, and it still tasted fine.  Next time I think I will reduce the mayo (maybe 1/3 cup?) and the poppy seeds (2 T. is WAY too much--maybe 1 T.?), and increase the vinegar (3 T.).  Also, I think this would taste great with toasted, candied almond slivers.  Thank you Mary for a delicious new way to use strawberries!  I will definitely make this again--in fact, I have some dressing left over! :-)

Wow, this was really good.  I was a little suspect as to how strawberries would taste with romaine lettuce, but the dressing was the kicker.  The flavors meshed together to well. This is a great "desert salad"!

I thought this was a great recipe, even with the changes I made so it would fit my diet. I replaced the sugar with Splenda and used fat free mayo. I also added a small amount of sliced toasted almonds. Everyone loved it. It was beautiful and colorful too. I will definitely make it again.

Fabulous recipe.  I used the Brianna's Rich Poppy Seed Dressing as per one of the reviews and it was "GREAT".  I also added chopped walnuts and let me tell you even my finicky salad eating husband loved this.  Try this recipe and you'll be hooked.

I just had to make this salad again, had a craving for it.  I only used romaine lettuce and red onions instead of the bermuda onions minus the poppy seeds and it is still really good.  The dressing is awesome.  Thanks for the recipe.

This has to be the best salad dressing I've ever made.  I've made it twice for guest, and both times were big hits.  Try making this dressing with lite dressing and Splenda for less calories.  I also made the recipe with regular sugar, and I couldn't tell a difference in the taste.

I love this recipe and have used it many times when we have dinner guests; they always love it too.  I couldn't find white wine vinegar so I used 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 balsamic and only did one Tbsp poppyseeds and it's still delish!

Excellent presentation and taste!  Can easily serve 10-12 when combining with a meal.  Made the dressing in the morning and tossed it in right before the meal.  So easy and so good!!

I've served this salad twice in the past 3 weeks and both times the recipe was requested by more than one person. It is perfect for summer. I took some others' advice and used a little less milk, chopped the onion (no Bermuda so I used Vidalia) very fine and added it to the dressing mix, and I offered Almond Accents as a sweet, crunchy topper.

I had to use just a regular onion cause that's all I had and I had no poppy seeds.  The dressing was delicious!  Very creamy and it makes a lot!

I have made this a couple of times now and it is wonderful. I made it for a bday party and i was asked a lot for the recipe. They loved the dressing. I also made it for dinner one nite when we had guests. The guests loved it and also wanted the recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and so refreshing!  And I'm not normally a fan of really sweet salads, but this was so light!  It was perfect.  I just left out the onions (don't like 'em).  I just made it for a family dinner - it was a perfect accompaniment to a heavier, cheesy pasta - and exceedingly easy to throw together.

I love this salad.The flavors are so good and it's so refreshing on a hot day. Don't add the dressing until right before you eat it. It gets a little soggy fast. But, make sure you try this. it's great. By the way, I used regular white vinegar and it was fine.

This is a great recipe, AND it is even better if you lighten it up a bit.  I use skim milk, reduced fat mayonnaise, and Splenda every time I make it, and it is awesome.  I also garnish it with ¼ - ½  bag of Almond Accents Honey Roasted Sliced Almonds AND ¼ - ½ bag of Almond Accents Italian Parmesan Slides Almonds (Usually found near the bagged lettuce or in the salad dressing aisle).
Thanks for the great, refreshing salad recipe!  It's always a hit!

THE BEST! I'd never had raw spinach and frankly the thought was unappealing, but I like romaine and love strawberries so I thought I'd give this a try. WOW! This was so delicious, and I LOVED this salad. Hubby didn't like it at all, too sweet he said, plus he doesn't like fruit in his salad. That's okay I ate my portion and hubby's too! I used a 50/50 blend of romaine/baby spinach that I found at the market. I don't like onion, but added it anyway, and even though I picked the onion rings out in my bowl, they added the best flavor to this and defintely shouldn't be omitted. I used light mayo and 2% milk and this came out fine, a creamy delicious dressing. I could have cut way back on the poppy seeds though, maybe even half, but even as written it's a winner! Thanks Mary, this is a wonderful addition to my recipe file!

This is an excellent salad that every one loved it. I made it yesterday and I will make it again and again. The strawberries and the dressing make all the difference.
I used spring onions together with sweet onions. There was some left over from yesterday and I found that the strawberries that remained in the dressing were even better the next day. So next time I will marinate the strawberries in the dressing for few hours. Thanks for a great recipe.

The poppyseed dressing made this salad.  I even added more strawberries than called for. I was asked to provide a mixed salad for a very large gathering and remembering that most times salad is the one dish that has alot leftover, was pleasantly surprised to note that everyone devoured it and asked for more.  Absolutely delicious.

This salad is delicious!  I made it for a baby shower and got at least ten requests for the recipe.  I use light mayo and also add a bit more vinegar to the dressing.  I've used both chopped walnuts and sliced almonds- I happen to prefer the almonds.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was delicious.  I didn't have poppy seeds so I omitted them and used a spring salad blend with romaine lettuce, spinach.  

Dressing a little sweet so you can back off on the sugar a bit but overall it was very delicious and refreshing and the strawberries gave it a wonderful refreshing blend of tang and sweet.  Delicious!

This is such a sweet refreshing salad. Everyone I make it for raves about it. I did make a few changes. I omitted the onions and added craisins. I also only used half the poppy seeds and that was plenty. It made a huge bowl.

This recipe is GREAT. I grilled some salmon and placed over salad, it was the best. I didn't use the romaine lettuce or poppy seeds. I made this in no time. Thanks for the recipe, I have all ready gave a copy to my co-worker. The dressing is awesome, a taste of sweetness, goes great with the other flavors.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe very much. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut down on the sugar, it was a bit sweet for my taste. I added pecans and fresh sliced mushrooms to the salad. Great way to use up my fresh strawberries!

This salad is amazing!  I tried it last summer and have made it several times since.  Everyone loves it and is surprised at the combination of strawberries and onions but finds it so delicious.  A definite keeper for me.

We loved this salad!  The dressing is delicious and the strawberries add such a good flavor.  We added some chopped walnuts and crumbled Gorgonzola to it and used red onion instead of Bermuda, but still delicious.  I'd make this again in a second!

This salad was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating it! I didn't have any poppy seeds but the dressing turned out yummy anyway.  Next time I'm going to try adding some mango slices.

Really liked this; added toasted pecans for some crunchiness. I also made one batch as written but adding pink grapefruit sections and leaving out the red onion. Absolutely great -- gives guests that "wow" factor.

I've been making this salad for years and it is wonderful.  Although I have purchased Poppyseed Dressing before, I really like to make my own!!  The only thing I do differently is add some mandarin oranges and some sliced almonds. Anyone reading this in need of a dish for a picnic or potluck....try this recipe!  I don't think you will be disappointed.

I have been making this salad for years and it's an all-time favorite & sure to please anywhere you take it...just be sure to toss right before serving. In my version of the dressing I use less poppy seeds (a little go a long way!) and I also add 1 tsp. of pure almond extract...it adds a fabulous twist to the flavor of the dressing and goes great with the strawberries.  I also add candied almonds and use only romaine...no spinach...but I think a little spinach would be ok.  A mayo-type dressing seems to me like it would be too "heavy" for those tender spinach leaves.  This is such an excellent summertime (or anytime!) salad!  :-)

Awesome!  It got rave reviews.  Per other reviews, I cut the amount of poppy seeds in half and it was plenty.  I put the lettuce, spinach, and strawberries in a large bowl, then on the side I had grilled chicken, chopped onions, dried cranberries, feta, and honey roasted almonds for people to add.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise because it's all I had, but it came out fine.  Very pretty presentation.

We love this salad!.  I do substitute yogurt for a little of the mayo to make the dressing lighter.   I use scallions as well as I find them to be more digestible then onion.

This salad is wonderful! Simple, beautiful and tasty. The only changes were suggestions from other reviewers and they really add to the salad. I added sliced almonds and cranberries. If you don't know what a Bermuda onion is it's just a regular sweet onion. I used red and chopped it up pretty small. My husband (not a big salad eater) loved it!

I made a small batch of this for the two of us.  I did bump up the white vinegar just a bit and didn’t use all the sugar or all the poppy seeds.  I used hearts of romaine mixed with red leaf lettuce and green onion, because I didn’t have red.  I just drizzled my dressing over the salads, instead of tossing – I didn’t want it to weight down my greens.  And I added the feta as others.  Very good!

This recipe was SPECTACULAR! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the mayo down to 1/3 cup. Instead of white wine vinegar I used red wine vinegar(3 tablespoons). I also cut the sugar and as another reviewer suggested I shook frozen rasberries in it. And lastly I just shook the poppyseed over the salad and poured the dressing when it was time to serve. I made it for a bridal shower and it was an absolute hit!! Everyone had a comment on it and I was quite proud! Thanks for the recipe, I will most definitely make this again

A wonderful, beautiful salad!  I did add gorgonzola cheese, chopped walnuts, red onion instead of bermuda (because that is what I had), and sliced fresh mushrooms to this salad. I also think that sliced hard boiled egg would be good too!  For the dressing, I used light mayo, skim milk and splenda.  WOW!  What a wonderful dressing!  This is a new favorite.  Thanks!

This is a very good salad.  I made it tonight with one head of romaine and just one bunch of spinach (it was a large bunch) and it made a ton.  If Strawberries arent in season, diced tart apple makes a really good substitute.  We like this, and its very pretty.  The dressing does go a long way, so be light with it and only dress as much salad as you think you will eat right then, because it wont keep after you put it on.

This is one of the best salads that I have ever had! The dressing is perfect and the poppy seeds add a nice little crunch.  Perfect with steak!

MAKE THIS SALAD!! It's absolutely wonderful!! I entertained seven guests, and even my salad-haters raved. The secret ingredients are the dressing and the strawberries.

Made this tonight, but didn't have any spinach.  It was still excellent (and I'm not much of a salad eater)!  I also added slivered almonds.  Yum!

Loved this! I didn't have any Bermuda Onion so I used half of a red onion instead. This was a big hit with my family of 5!  We are cutting gluten from our diet and this was a pleasant start.

This was a great salad!  Everyone one loved it, even my husband who doesn't really like salads. He had 2 bowls!  I made some substitutions because my daughter is allergic to diary and it was still great.  I used Soy Vanilla milk and a dairy free mayonnaise from Trader Joes... Everything else was the same and I didn't use any spinach because I didn't have any in the house.  Great salad!

The salad was okay and the dressing was fine.  I thought it had too much onion in the mix.  I used a small red onion and sliced it very thin but it was still overwhelming for my taste.
I would reduce it by 50% at least, especially when serving to a mixed age group.
I used non fat milk in the mix and I don't think it changed the flavor.
The spinach was a nice addition for me personally since I just don't like the texture of Romaine.

Loved the dressing! I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have any white wine vinegar. I also used black seasame seeds instead of poppy seeds and just sprinkled them on the salad itself. I will definitly be making this again. Thanks for sharing!!

I absolutly love this salad and I have been given great compliments.  
I do not use the romaine, only Spinach. I add Walnut Halfs.
The dressing is so good and easy to make.  I use Black Sesame Seeds instead of poppy seeds and I add them to the salad last, instead of mixing in with dressing.
You do not have to use Strawberries...You can use Green or Purple Grapes. 
You can also add feta cheese to the salad as well.  I have used each modification and the salad is amazing.  
Play with the recipe and have fun...
Shoot maybe try mandrine oranges.  =)

Very yummy & very sweet! I added mandarins, honey'd almonds & other field berries. ALL the kids loved this one. Def'ly a keeper. We skipped the spinach & just used a variety of lettuce. Served as lunch on its own on a hot day.

this is now my favorite salad. i made it and my son said it was more like a desert then a salad. it was sweet but i like sweet so it was perfect for me. i made some small changes to it, i used a red onion, splenda blend sugar, lite mayo and 1% milk. but i kept the same measurements and it turned out great. i made it again the next day and gave it to my family and the whole family loved it. so i guess i have a new recipe to bring to a gathering or when i have some friends over for dinner.

This was absolutely delicious. Have made it for three different occasions, and got rave reviews every time.   I was having a hard time finding bermuda onion so i used 1/4 of a red onion instead (thinly sliced), and added candied walnut. to the mix.   I made twice as much dressing, and keep the remainder in a jar ready for the next time my mood strikes for some yummy strawberry romaine salad!!

I made this salad for a bunch of friends the other night and everyone LOVED it.  I use a similar dressings on most of my salads.  I would recommend cutting back on the sugar and poppy seeds just a little.  Will definitely make again, great flavors!

Made this salad for a potluck fishing derby in Canada and it was the first bowl that was empty.  I did leave out the onion and spinach and used a large bag of iceberg lettuce instead as there were many children there.  Threw in a cup of fresh picked blueberries along with the strawberries and added 1/2 cup of cashews for crunch.  Got lots of compliments.  Would definately make it again.  Thanks for sharing thing wonderful recipe.

I used all Romaine (knowing that some of the people I'd be serving it to would automatically pass if it contained spinach) and left out the onion for the same reason.  Also, I threw in a small handful of crumbled feta to dress it up a bit. I went home with an empty bowl and several requests that I email the recipe.  The dressing is perfect with this combination.

I enjoyed this very much.  I've made it with craisins when strawberries are out of season.  Almonds or pecans are good too.  The dressing is great on other salads too.

I made this to accompany a cook out meal I prepared for guests (kind of something else to just add to the table) but everyone loved it more than the meal and they wanted more and more!  Even the kids liked it.  Perfect for those summer nights when you don't want to heat up the kitchen!  Can't wait to make more.

I've always seen this made with just spinach, but it always wilts right away - the romaine was a great substitute and really holds up. I suggest leaving the spinach out all together, unless you're not going to have ANY leftovers.  Great dressing too!  I always add a little less sugar to the dressing, but that's just personal taste.

Excellent salad.  I made this for my bunko group and everyone loved it.  I left out the onions and poppy seeds because I don't like them and it was still wonderful.  Not good as leftovers, the lettuce gets soggy.  Now I make just the dressing to put over my salad whenever I want.

Yum! I didn't use the bermunda onion, but it turned out beautifully. Just make sure to add the dressing to the greens just before serving so your lettuce doesn't go soggy.

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes, like using raspberry vinegar, and adding candied pecans and mandarin oranges.  Yum yum!

I put a piece of broiled salmon on top of a serving of this salad (along with some chopped walnuts) and it made a delicious cool summer dinner.

This recipe is awesome.  The sugary dressing and the strawberries make it the best.  And this version is so much simpler to make then similar recipes.  It also has the fewest ingredients.

I had this at a potluck at work & loved it,
then found the recipe here and tried it
for a family reunion and it was a BIG hit, 
I doubled the recipe and before the line was
halfway through, the salad was already 
gone. Some people don't like it because 
it is sweet but overall it's a big hit.

This salad was hit with my Bunco group. I added blueberries.  Also, I used a 4 quart measing cup for the dressing since I doubled it to have left-overs.  I used a wisk to combine the ingredients. That worked like a charm and the measing cup made pouring easy.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added the poppy  seeds directly to the salad instead of in the dressing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is AWESOME!  I used Red Wine vinegar instead simply because I like it better.  This can easily be adapted to make it your own.  Next time I make this I think I'm going to add some oranges, feta, & nuts!  Maybe add some grilled chicken or steak to it also!!

Although I try not to alter recipes and then rate them, I just couldn't help myself this time.  I left out the onion since my family really doesn't like raw onion very much.  I reduced the poppy seeds to 1T and added a little feta cheese and toasted pecans.  I could probably eat this daily and not get sick of it...YUM!

Tastes great! I modified the dressing to make it lower calorie by using plain yogurt instead of mayo & stevia instead of sugar. Will make again:)

This recipe was pretty good, but I would suggest only making what you think your crowd will actually eat - or keep the dressing on the side.  I dressed the salad and that made the leftovers very soggy and gross.   I used toasted slivered almonds instead of poppy seeds.

This was awsome!! Made this and brought it to my parents on Easter was a big hit there was none leftover. Everyone was a little unsure of trying this but once they did they had seconds lol. Only thing i would do next time is make more of the dressing that seemed to be what makes this salad soo good!

I added a lot of stuff to this recipe - sliced grilled chicken, candied walnuts and feta cheese.  However the spirit of the recipe remains and the dressing is just fabulous - super light and zesty (although 1 tbsp of poppy seeds is sufficient).  Absolutely mouth watering!

It was an OK salad. I was expecting much more flavor - The dressing was super sweet and I had decreased the sugar. I am glad I didn't toss the whole salad with the dressing - I had everyone drizzle their portions (had to instruct everyone to go light on the drizzle)

This one was a huge hit with my husband. I was looking for something outside of the normal everyday salad, and this proved to be the recipe I was looking for. The kids really enjoyed it, too. I love the appearance of this salad as well. It's great for eating at home, or taking to a dinner function.

Awesome salad.  I had to use iceberg because it was all I had and it was still really good. The combo of the strawberries and onions was a surprisingly good combination.

Served this at my son's graduation party in May. This salad is really remarkable. Guests comments ranged from "refreshing," "light," and "yummy!" It was the sleeper hit of the lunch spread.

Delicious! My boyfriend asks me to make this over and over again. To save money I just used baby greens instead of the spinach and romaine. Also, I didn't have the vinegar so I used Marsala cooking wine. Slice the onions paper thin. Next time I hope to use light mayo. Didn't change ingredient quantities - everything was perfect. Look for store brand poppy seeds compared to the fancy ones to save money.

Very good salad! I used white onion instead of red because it was all I had, and it turned out fine.  I cut the poppy seeds by 1/2 and it was much better.  Dressing was fantastic!

I followed this recipe exactly. It was DELICIOUS. My husband, who later admitted that he was very skeptical of the strawberries in a salad idea, ate half of it himself.

Absolutely delicious! This is the first berry salad I've ever eaten, and now I won't be able to stop! I added some cabbage and left out the poppy seeds since I didn't have any.

Love this recipe.  We tend to leave the onion out (only because the kids won't eat onion).  With the dressing I tend to only put in half of the poppy seeds, but that is just personal preference.  And we sometimes add crumbled up goat cheese to the salad.  Always a big hit for us at potluck functions.  Thanks for the recipe.

I took this salad to a lunchen and everyone wanted the recipe. I used light mayo, 2% milk and substituted half the sugar with stevia.  I added sliced almonds and craisens.  I also make the dressing and leave it in a jar.

I took this salad to work for one of our birthday carry-ins. It was gone within the hour and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe called except for the poppy seeds - I didn't have any. It was just wonderful. I made a smaller one for at home and it disappeared just as quickly. Easy and quick. Wonderful.

Made this salad for 4th July get together and it got rave reviews. I added blueberries and crumbled feta as suggested by another reviewer. The dressing was a little too sweet for me personally but judging by the empty plates, I was in the minority. Definitely   one to keep and make again in the future.

Loved the salad, even my husband who supposedly HATES all salads loved it. Used light mayo along with spenda to keep it lighter in calories. It is now one of my top favourite salads. I even threw some prawns in one night.  Thanks for submitting

Wonderful salad!  We make it for 4th of July and add blueberries, sliced almonds and some feta cheese crumbles along with the strawberries.  It makes a red, white and blue salad!

This is a great salad! We actually serve this at the restaurant that I work at, except we add pecans which makes it even more delicious. Also, if you chop the onions fine enough, you can add them to the dressing (it gives them a ton more flavor).

This is a great recipe. My variation that I have made for years adds chopped walnuts and instead of making the dressing yourself, try Briannas' Rich Poppy Seed Dressing...it is tremendously flavorful!

This is a fabulous recipe.  One of the best salads I've ever had. The combination of the sweet dressing, strawberries and the onion is very different and great.  It's also a very pretty presentation.  No one likes onions other than me, so I left those out and just added them to my serving separately.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make.  I brought it to a picnic and it was a hit.  I left out the onions, however, because I wanted the kids to eat it.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This salad is so good.  I'm glad I finally tried it.  I did not use spinach or poppy seeds.  All other ingredients were so delicious together.  I did cut the recipe down to two servings.  We enjoyed it very much. I will certainly make this again.  Thank you Mary J for sharing your recipe.

Excellent! Easy! Refreshing! Made this salad yesterday for a family BBQ. Everyone was raving about it. I even had someone ask to take the little bit of left over salad home. I will make this again and again this summer!

I've made this a few times and find it to be a refreshing change from my usual more salty/zesty salads. I often use just spinach as I always have some in my fridge. I find this goes great with most dishes too.

I use light mayo and add extra poppy seeds onto the salad in addition to those mixed into the dressing plus I use rice vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar as that's what I have on hand, I think it cuts some of the sweetness out.

Update 3-6-2017 I made the dressing tonight using an erythritol/stevia blend and almond milk. Still delicious! 6-6-2013 I love this salad! I used green leaf lettuce in place of the romaine. Love, love, love the dressing. So easy to throw together, and it looks so elegant.

UPDATE: I SENT MY NEIGHBOR HOME WITH LEFTOVERS (I SERVED THIS SALAD ALONGSIDE THE CHICKEN TORTILLA CASSEROLE WE HAD FOR DINNER) AND SHE LOVED IT. HER HUSBAND LOVED THE DRESSING AND DRIZZLED IT OVER CUT UP CELERY. IT'S A MATTER OF PREFERENCE, I GUESS. I STILL STAND TRUE TO MY INITIAL RATING BUT WANTED TO LET THE AR COMMUNITY KNOW THAT MY NEIGHBORS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS. :) I hate to be the downer here, but this was not nearly as good as I hoped it would be. Having said this, I think the addition of toasted or candied nuts, cubed chicken or even mandarin oranges would take this over the top! As is, this was a tad too bland for my liking. The dressing was good (not WOW!), but I felt the salad itself was lacking "oomph." I also didn't care for the Romaine in this (I guess I prefer strawberries paired with spinach). Maybe this will float your boat, but I'm going to keep searching for the perfect summer salad. Thanks anyways, Mary! :-)

I took this to our family Easter celebration.  It was very good!  I put a little more lettuce in which seemed to tone down the sweetness of the dressing and used red onions instead of Bermuda onions.  It was a refreshing change to our usual holiday food!

I absolutely love this salad!  My kids love it, too - and I have 4, so that is something.

The dressing is easy peasy to put together and shake in the mason jar.  I omit poppyseeds because one of my kids is allergic to them, but other than that, I stick to the recipe.  I also use a fat-free mayo to make it healthier.

This was REALLY good.  I did not have spinach but it turned out great. I added just a touch less than the sugar that was called for, but not by much.  Loved it.  I am having it for lunch the second day in a row.

very good!  I made a few minor changes.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and black raspberry infused white wine vinegar.  I used part Splenda and part sugar, too.  I added feta cheese and bacon bits to the salad.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a very easy great salad! I have found that when it comes to the lettuce it's pretty flexible. You can adjust it pretty much how ever you want. So far every where I have brought it people have liked it!

I used less sugar,  1 Tbsp poppy seeds, craisins, a combo of lettuce and spinach on hand, and sliced almonds.  Next time, I will use walnut halves and all spinach.  It was supposed to serve 6, but 3 people finished it off . . . a good sign.  Pretty and elegant salad for entertaining!

I love this salad not only because it's easy to prepare, but I like the contrasting colors of red and green.  My husband, who is from Puerto Rico and did not grow up eating "greens" loved it, especially the dressing.  I used sunflower seeds instead of the poppy seeds in the dressing.  Excellent and cool for a hot Florida day.

I made this for Mother's Day, and let's just say I could've simply made this for my mom and not even gotten her a gift.  She LOVED it, and it was perfect for a crowd.  The dressing got rave reviews, however it was a bit sweet for my taste, and I may add just a touch less sugar next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Easter lunch and it was fabulous! I Added mandarine oranges for more color. The dressing was great, although I only added 1/2 the amount of poppy seeds it listed. Will make this again!

This is delicious and very pretty! I omitted the onions and added chopped candied pecans, although next time I'll add them right before serving.  They got a little soggy. I did not have any white wine vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar and it was great! I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe is delicious. It is a hit EVERY time. I now have to make it for every function.... people request it in advance! The dressing is sweet but very tasty and mixes wonderfully with the flavours of the strawberries and spinach. The only thing I do differently is leave out the onions. This recipe lacks nothing even when omitting them. I think the onions may be to strong of a taste for these mild sweet flavours. Thanks for the post Mary J.

This was a really great salad, although I used the recipe more for the dressing than the actual salad.  I used low fat mayo, and halved the amount of poppy seeds.

I was suprized that the simple dressing came out so sweetly fantastic.  I would, like others, reduce the amount of poppy seed as I felt there was quite a bit more than needed.

This is the best because it is simple and flexible - I made a fraction of the recipe without spinach or poppy seeds and with: + apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar + almond milk instead of regular milk + small section of yellow onion instead of Bermuda onion.  It still turned out great!

Decided to give this a try even though my husband is not a big salad lover. Was is he pleasantly suprised? I would say so. My compliments to the submitter. I cut back on the sugar and did not have poppy seeds but did not deter from the taste. Definitely give this a try.

So, I saw this recipe and decided I had to try it. My husband said "EW STRAWBERRY SALAD GROSS!", but begrudgingly agreed to at least try it if I was going to go through the effort to make it. guess who decided strawberries in salads aren't a bad thing? Now, he asks for it all the time. It's surprisingly delicious, and very different from the usual garden salad. Definitely give it a shot if you're on the fence about whether or not to make it.

This is simple and delicious.  I love mayo so I used the whole amount also used the whole amount of poppy seeds.  I think I may add another TB of vinegar next time.  Also added slivered almonds to the salad as a toppping.

Yummy! This was a lovely salad. I think I'm going to serve my version of this at a tea/luncheon I'm hosting soon.  The only changes I made were using low-fat mayo and cutting back on the sugar, plus only adding about 1/2, maybe 3/4, of the dressing.  I don't like salads that are swimming in dressing.  I also don't care for poppy seeds, but wanted some crunch, so I toasted a few pecans (olive oil, pinch of brown sugar and cinnamon), gave them a rough chop and topped the salad with them.  I may have this again tomorrow!

I loved this. I followed the directions, but used half light mayo and half regular,[I don't think it made any difference] but I think next time I'll try all light mayo. I loved this as is, but I could see if someone wanted to cut down on the sugar and poppy seeds:)

Absolutely wonderful!!!!  I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the amount of poppy seeds in half and I added some sliced almonds.  I made it on Thursday night for a dinner party I was attending and it got rave reviews.  The following night I was hosting a dinner party and made it again (because I was craving it!).  Once again, everyone couldn't stop talking about how good it was and all wanted the recipe.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

The salad was a very elegant and refreshing summer salad. I omitted the spinach and poppy seeds, added toasted sesame seeds, and less milk to make it creamier.  The flavor is a bit sweet, so I balanced it out with a little more white wine vinegar and some dry mustard.    I minced finely 2 T of red onions and let in soak in the dressing for an hour or two and the dressing was awesome!  Yummy!

Amazing salad! I used one 9 oz. bag of spinach a head of romaine, 1 red onion and 2 lbs. of strawberries. No adjustments at all to the dressing! It was very delicious, not overly sweet and just the right amount of tang to compliment all the flavors! Even the picky eaters at my party loved this! I will certainly be making it again!

Gorgeous salad! I served this with our Easter dinner and it was FABULOUS! Even the red onion haters were nuts for it. The dressing makes it and ties it all together. I used 1 T poppyseeds instead of 2 and a 1/4 C suger as one reviewer suggested and it was the perfect sweetness. This will surely be part of my spring summer salad rotation!

This makes a nice light, tasty salad.  Very quick to pull together.  Based on other reviews I did reduce the poppy seeds to 1 T. and the sugar to 1/4 C.  I also sprinkled in some dried minced onion (maybe a half T.) into the dressing rather than the fresh onions (make sure you allow time for the onions to soften though if you do this)and added blue cheese crumbles and slivered almonds.  Went over well at the party. Will for sure make again.

This salad is SO yummy!  I made it a couple of weeks ago for a get together, and I've been craving it ever since!  It's pretty sweet, and it is very refreshing!  I am planning to make it today for a Labor Day party I'm going to!   I put the dressing on as needed so mine never got soggy.  I didn't use poppy seeds because I didn't know where to find them and I used sweet Maui Onions.  It was still GOOD!

I, too, recommend adding toasted walnuts.  I also omitted the Bermuda onion as I didnt have one on hand and it was fine w/o it.  Wonderful - I love new salad recipes.  The dressing was great; I used light mayo.  Will absolutely make again.

Great salad.  Family went back for seconds.  The only thing I would use a little less poppy seeds next time I make it but it was definitely a winner.

This is my favorite salad and dressing now. I make this at least once a month (if not more). I use red onion and have made using sugar and have used truvia sweetner to replace the sugar. I like the mixture of romaine and spinach but have used with other mixtures as well. I will continue making this. The strawberries, onion and dressing are such a complement to each other. It is amazing.

This was excellent! I scaled it down half-way and made it as a one dish salad for myself for dinner. The dressing was great; I cut back on the sugar, and it was still very good. I also added and assortment of olives, because I love 'em in salads. To a small portion of it, I added some crumbled blue cheese, and that worked really well in this salad. A keeper - thanks!

The salad was great! I halved fresh grapes and added them too. I also carmelized the onion prior to putting in in the salad. Really yummy and easy to put together! Goes great with BBQ chicken too.

Love this salad!!  Very easy, but  makes an impressive "company" dish.  I've made it several times, and will continue to do so!!   Hulling and slicing the strawberries is the the most time consuming step.

I made the recipe as written and I loved it! Don't skip the onion - it offsets the sweetness of the dressing and berries for a perfect balance. This is super quick and easy. It will be one of my favorite summer recipes for the future

This salad is delicious,  I did change a few things, I use Stevia instead of sugar and strawberry kefir instead of milk, I used rice vinegar because I prefer it in the dressing and it was fantastic,  I added tomatoes and used shallots instead of onion because I had them.  I made it 2 times this week and am making it again today for a potluck. 
Everyone loved it.
Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This is a very pretty and sweet-tasting summer salad.  At first I thought the dressing was too sweet but once it was mixed with the actual salad it was delicious!  Try low fat mayo and 2% milk and even Splenda for the sugar for a healthier choice.  Don't forget the onions and try adding some toasted pecans for a little extra crunch and flavor.

I didn't have romaine on hand so I used iceberg lettuce instead and I substituted Bermuda onions for red onions. This would be a 5-star rating but I find the dressing to be a bit on the watery side. Next time I will add a little more mayo to make it creamier. My daughter's friend who only eats Italian dressing asked for a second serving of this salad. I will definitely make again.

I didn't change a thing here. The dressing is quite sweet but the strawberries and onion compliment it so amazing well!  I saved this recipe years ago and have made it so many times. My husband loves it. I haven't added anything to it but I'm starting to think some nuts would be a nice addition

I've made a strawberry salad a few times, everyone likes it.  It's a wonderful healthy Salad  for the summer.

The dressing, I typically buy the Briannah's Homestyle Blush Wine Vinaigrette, which is perfect for this salad, but I wanted a creamy dressing to offer, for  those who like the creamy taste.

As is, I found it too sweet.  I didn't want to throw it out, so I tweeked it.  I added some red wine vinegar, about a teaspoon, made a big difference in taking out some of the sweet.

I also added a teaspoon of ranch dressing, because I had some.  Added some depth, and took more of the sweetest out.

I also think, going forward, I will use half sour cream, half mayonnaise.  The mayo taste was too obvious, and I didn't care for it.  I may also use some honey in this recipe, to taste.

I did add seseme seeds, as I didn't have poppy.

substituted 2% plain Greek yoghurt for the mayo and black sesame seeds for poppy seeds as well as unsweetened vanilla almond milk for milk.  Great tasting salad and easy to make.  Yes, I would definitely make it again.  Probably this week!

I opted to use mixed greens instead of romaine and spinach.
