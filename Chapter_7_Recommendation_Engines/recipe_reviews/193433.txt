This is a good, very basic recipe. I would definitely make it again, but I would add some spices to it he next time. I also used real ground meat instead of the veggie ground.

When my husband and I told our 15 year old son that we expected him to make dinner I told him to go to allrecipes.com.He chose this recipe and he and our 9 yr old son made this by themselves(having never cooked before).They were great. They used italian cheese(because it was in a bag already shredded)instead of cheddar but it worked out fine.Can't wait to make it myself with a few extra ingredients.
