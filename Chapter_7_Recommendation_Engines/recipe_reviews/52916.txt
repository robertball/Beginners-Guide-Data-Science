This recipe is really great!  I couldn't find smoked pork shoulder, so I settled for the un-smoked variety, although a local butcher offered to make some for me.  After 2.5 hours of boiling the pork was so tender it was falling apart with my fork.  The maple taste is subtle.  I'm kind of unsure what to do with the broth since it tastes fantastic as well - maybe I can turn it into some kind of soup.  ** UPDATE: My wife found the broth WAY too sweet for her liking.**

I liked how easy it was, but it was unexciting.
