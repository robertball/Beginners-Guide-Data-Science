Kickin' martini, not too tart, not too sweet.  I muddled a lemon wedge with the simple syrup and ice before adding the vodka and juice.  Gives an essential lemon flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!!  These could be dangerous, I'm on my second one!!

A good martini. I skinny it up by using Diet Cranberry/Pomegranate juice. I make my own simple "syrup" out of 2 cups of water + 2 Cups of powdered Splenda -- bring to a boil, boil for a minute and set aside to cool. Refrigerate "syrup" when cool.

This is yummy.  There is a nice balance between the sweetness and tang.  I can do without the sugar on the rim.
