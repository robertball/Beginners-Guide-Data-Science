If you enjoy clam chowder then you should like this recipe. My roommates really enjoyed this and they are picky eaters. I made a much smaller quantity (about 8 servings worth) so cooking times were greatly reduced (except for the cook times in step 3). Add some dried parsley in the final step for a little extra flavor.

We live near a river and my husband caught a soft shell turtle.  I tried this recipe and it was wonderful.  I did use light margarine instead of butter and 2% milk instead of whole milk.  It was still very rich and I believe we cut some of the fat out.  I'm making this one again thanks Mike.
