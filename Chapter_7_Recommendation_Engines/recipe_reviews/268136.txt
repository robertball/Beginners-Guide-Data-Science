I have to say....this was a little more steps than normal, but soooo worth the effort!!!  Word of caution though:  be careful with the cayenne pepper if you do not like it too spicy.  Otherwise go for it!!!  Instead of oregano which I did not have on hand, I threw in some sage, rosemary and thyme (all fresh) and  WOW! it was what took this recipe to the next level!  The herbs were crunchy and I put them on top of the potatoes.  Not only was it delicious but added to the presentation.  Thanks Chef John for this wonderful recipe which I will be fixing a lot!

I enjoyed it but the family did not. To be fair they have a valid point, the pepper  overpowered the lemon and other seasonings.  Too spice for them, should be called peppery lemon potatoes. Also took longer than an hour to soak up all of the liquid.

I love how the lemon flavor actually infuses itself inside the potatoes, like the lemon potatoes I once had at a Greek restaurant. 

It does take longer than stated for the broth to be absorbed.   I had about two cups of broth to use, so I poured it all on for part of the cooking time.  Then I drained off the extra lemon/broth so that the rest could be absorbed. When serving, I drizzled it back on the potatoes instead of the oil suggested. Delicious.

Excellent basic recipe.  I made it once as written and have since  varied the spices to adapt it to my tastes.  As noted the left overs make great pan fries.

I love Chef John's recipes and usually they are rock solid tasty dishes, but this one just didn't deliver for me.  Perhaps I did something wrong.  There was some initial hesitation because the video does not instruct on how long to roast the potatoes for the final homestretch.  My potatoes were much smaller than his and they were in for at least 30 minutes and still weren't crispy like his (still quite a bit of olive oil pooled on the bottom).  So after thirty minutes, I turned on the broiler for 7-8 minutes and got a little crisp, but basically wrecked my pan by burning on the remnants at the bottom.  So I finally got a little crisp, but upon eating them, they just didn't have that much flavor.  I used plenty of lemon zest and juice and a lot of pepper, but the dish was just bland.  This recipe, especially given the amount of work involved, just isn't one I'd use again.  I'd prefer a normal baked potato.

Great dish! Made no changes except used only 2 very large potatoes as there were four of us for dinner.  The liquid wasn't quite all used up at the end, so would either reduce the amount slightly or do all the potatoes, but they were still fabulous.  Worth the extra work.

I substituted chicken base (I highly recommend Better than Bouillon brand) about 1 1/2 tsp mixed into 3/4 cup water with 1/4 cup lemon juice in place of the lemon zest. I also used "Slap your mama" cajun seasoning salt in place of the salt and peppers. This will become part of my regular rotation - excellent and not labor intensive, just remember to ask Alexa to remind you to flip them at the appropriate times.

It turned out pretty well. I did roast the potatoes quite a bit longer than recommended because they hadn't absorbed all the liquid at the end of the recommended time. Also they were way too hot for my taste so if I make them again, I won't use cayenne pepper.

I've made these a couple of times now and they are incredible! I use dry oregano instead of fresh and it comes out just fine. The only thing that is off is the cooking time. For me they usually need an extra 10 or 15 mins to absorb all the liquid.

I loved them. MY girlfriend not so much. 

I found them to be just what the recipe said it would be. Crunchy outside and hot soft potato inside. 

I will make again.

I followed the recipe as written, except one of my four potatoes was rotten, so I had less potato. Even so, it took well over an hour for the potatoes to soak up the juice. They ended up pretty bland. If I try again, I will reduce the broth, keep the lemon amount intact.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (vegans, here).  While mine tasted delicious, they didn't brown and crisp like Chef John's. I will definitely try them again. Great flavor.

Outstanding!   Family loved it.  I used one lemon. But would use 2 next time.   Caution on the cayenne pepper.   If you don’t like spicy need to forgo.  
Chopped up the leftovers the next day and sautéed in some olive oil for a nice breakfast potato.

Turned out really well.  Sprinkled with lemon pepper.  Was afraid to use too much cayenne but will use more next time. Didn’t have a lemon so added a bit of lemon juice to broth but will use an actual lemon next time.  Didn’t need whole amount of broth either.

I was not a fan of this one. I think it's the only Chef John recipe I haven't liked. First, the potatoes took an hour and forty to cook until they were done (we do live at 6,300 feet elevation, so I'm sure that had something to do with it). Then after all that waiting, the flavor was just okay. I'm thinking if I decide to try it again, I'll cube the potatoes to cut baking time.

Liquid did not all evaporate, I did not get the crispy outside.  Sure it is my oven. Beside that, the flavor of the tators was fabulous. I will definitely try this recipe again.

Made according to recipe except that I used dried oregano instead of the fresh oregano sprigs. I thought they were okay but nothing special and won't make again. I like Chef John's recipes not this one especially.
