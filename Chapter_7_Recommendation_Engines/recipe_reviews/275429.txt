I really need to use my air fryer more! These were so easy and delicious, and I didn't have to heat up the kitchen by cranking the oven up to 400 degrees! I made these as directed, using multi-colored potatoes. They were all very odd sized, so I had to cut the larger ones in quarters in order to get even sized with the smaller ones. Because of this, I should have adjusted the time slightly, as they were just a little bit over-done. The purple ones LOOK extremely over-done, but they weren't, it was just because of their dark color. I was surprised at how crispy these were on the outside, and nice and creamy on the inside. Will definitely make these again.

Loved how simple and flavorful this was and I loved how I was able to incorporate my fresh rosemary that I don't use often. On that note, my rosemary did burn a bit so I will reduce the temp next time. Excellent recipe!

I added baby carrots to the mix, used granulated garlic, and skipped the lemon, but they came out great!

Delicious and so easy to put together.  The center is creamy and the seasoning is perfect.
