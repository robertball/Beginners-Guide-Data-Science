Fantastic and easy recipe. We've been looking for a simple quinoa recipe and this is it!
We don't keep shallots and cremini mushrooms in stock so I substituted white onions and white mushrooms and itt turned out to be quite tasty.
As the other review stated, it could have used about half the salt.
Thanks for this recipe!

great stuff, fabulous taste, but I used commercial vegetable broth, and even omitting the added salt this was waaaay salty!!!! Next time I'll try reduced sodium chicken broth instead, because it was simple enough and tasty enough to merit extra chances and experimentation.

Very tasty!  I'm so glad hubby liked this!  Miracle!  If you are sensitive to salt, I'd start out with a little less salt because you can always add more.  I thought it bordered on being just a little salty---which could be because even though I did use a good organic version of vegetable stock, it may have contained more salt than I figured on (I really need to make my own---note to self).  I may have added a touch more mushrooms and shallot than it called for, but that's normal for me.  Very good!  Thanks!

geez-owie is this good.  was looking for a vegetarian potluck recipe and this fit the bill.  only changes I made are to omit the added salt (not needed if your stock is flavorful), used shitake instead of cremini (it's what my shroom vendor had), and I added toasted slivered almonds at the end.  Next time I will use less liquid, as it was too moist (my normal quinoa recipe calls for less than 2:1 water to grain, so I should have held back).  Other than that, great!  and it dried out overnight to a better consistency.  I can see this being a go-to recipe because of all its healthy ingreds (3 of the GBOMBS!).  No reason not to increase the mushroom and shallot amounts.  Also, I think any sliced shrooms will do fine.

I didn't even add the onions, and it turned out to be very tasty.  I didn't have rice, so I chose this recipe.  It beats rice by far.

This recipe is amazing - one of my absolute favorites. That being said, definitely cut the salt in half or even just don't add any at all if your stock is already salty. Other than that, I like a few more mushrooms and shallots.

I cut the quinoa to 1/2 cup because this recipe was only for one person. I used a styo-box of mushrooms and about 1-1/2 cups of home-made veg broth. I also added 2T of sesame seeds and toasted with the mushrooms. I used this as a side dish with leftovers, but will also use it as a main course in the future because it has good protein as is. I

This was pretty much flavor-free. After my first taste, I doubled the mushrooms and threw in a handful of sliced scallions, but it didn't help.

My daughter hasn't warmed up to quinoa until this dish. The thing that made this a winner is sauteing the quinoa in olive oil to brown. It really brings out flavor! I didn't have a shallot or mushrooms, so I used 1/4 of a white onion, and a 1/2 cup of broccoli, chopped. I think it would be wonderful with the shallots and mushrooms, but I didn't have time to go to the store. I also used chicken broth (all I had on hand) with great results. I didn't find it too salty, but used good, low salt broth. The only thing I added was some shredded parmesan cheese to the hot quinoa once I dished it onto plates. Just a sprinkle. The family really liked this dish. It will make it into our regular rotation for sure!

I have never had quinoa before so I wasn't sure what to expect. Much better then I thought it would be and very easy. I used Chicken stock because that's what I had and it was still good. I think it's a fun thing to experiment with and add your favorite things. I will do feta and nuts next time.

Yummy! Hubby and I are trying to eat healthy and this is a great alternative to pasta or white rice. Followed the recipe, except used only 1 teaspoon salt. Can't wait to add some extra veggies to the leftovers and have a totally different dish tomorrow. It made enough for both of us to eat again tomorrow.

followed pretty close to the recipe.  I did use chicken stock instead of veggie and used the whole carton.  Also cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon.  Really like this side dish.

I've made this dozens of times and it's always a hit. Because I love shallots and mushrooms, I use way more than the recipe calls for, and it still works.

I liked this one. I added more mushrooms and also garbanzo beans. Next time however I would omit the garbanzo beans and maybe I'll add feta as one of the other reviewers suggested.

I did not care for this recipe. We used hen of the woods mushrooms from our yard that are always delicious, and we ended up picking them out of the pilaf and leaving the rest. I've tried to find ways to use quinoa that we like; this just isn't to our taste.

The proportions seemed to be way off, but are something that can be corrected the next time I make it.  There was way too much quinoa for the amount of mushrooms and onions in the recipe.  But I could see that with some adjustments, it will be better and more flavorful next time.

it's a fabulous dish that i've altered for my vegan niece by using veggie stock and the water that i've soaked my dried mushroom with. Followed pretty much the whole recipe as is with the following addition: 1 c dried wild mushrooms soaked in 4 c of boiling water for min of 45 mins - chop them and add with fresh mushrooms (1 cup chopped) and also add fresh chopped kale as well - approx 4 c

Thank you so much for this recipe, it is so tasty and healthy, I can't get enough of it!  I added a little curry in the end and it gave it a delicious twist. Loved it!
