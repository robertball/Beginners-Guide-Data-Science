I slow cooked on low for 6 hours and the liquid burned. The meat was tender with just a touch of bite, so I quickly put together a Korean bbq sauce (recipe on Allrecipes) and used it instead of the cooking liquid. Some sour cream and sriracha finished off the tacos nicely.

I used a mixture of grape seed oil, tamari, and Montreal steak seasoning. Other than this minor change I followed the recipe. I like the crunch the carrot slaw provided. I may make it again sometime
