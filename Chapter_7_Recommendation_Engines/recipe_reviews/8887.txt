This recipe was really good. I modified it a bit. I did not use cooking cherry, I used 3/4 of a cup of marsala wine instead. I used twice the mushrooms and after I browned the chicken I removed it from the pan and cooked the mushrooms and some shrimp and them added a little heavy whipping cream and reduced it to make a marsala cream sauce and then I added the chicken back and served it over garlic and basil fettuccine. It turned out awesome. I have work in a few 5 star restaurants and had chicken and veal marsala in a lot of restaurants and this is the closest I have gotten the dish to taste myself!!

oh my gosh this dinner was amazing!  Not only that, but incredibly easy. I made a few changes, as usual, and everyone -loved- the results.
1- To make it easier to clean up, i put the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a resealable plastic bag, then added the pounded chicken and shook it up (one breast at a time) to coat. It's just easier and cleaner that way.
2- When browning the chicken breasts, i added a few sliced cloves of garlic. mmm
3- I doubled the sauce, probably trippled the mushrooms (the more the merrier, right?) and then thickened it with a slurry (water-cornstarch mixture) at the end so we could enjoy it over the angelhair pasta i served it on. So good.
4- i added a splash of heavy cream and a splash of chicken broth to the sauce, to make it richer and creamier, like i'm used to Chicken Marsala being.

as other users suggested, buy good Marsala wine. It's really not all that expensive, especially if you compare it to how much it costs to eat out at a nice italian restaurant. ;)

I've been using this recipe for about 5 years now and from the first time I made this, it's been nothing short of excellent.  I made it this past weekend at a dinner party for somewhere between 25-30 people and everyone loved it as does everyone I've ever made this for.  

I tend to spend a little more time on prep work because I'm very picky about my chicken, and I take time to trim off as many of those little fatty pieces as possible prior to pounding it out flat.  Sometimes that one chewy bite of fat ruins a good piece of chicken for me!

Here's a few things I do in addition to what the recipe says.  I mentioned I cut out any fatty pieces.  I chop up some onion and add it when I throw the mushrooms in the pan.  It doesn't 'make or break' this, but adds a nice little 'extra' when it's sauteed.  If you buy whole mushrooms and find it too tedious/time consuming to slice them with a knife ...either buy them already sliced (usually a $1.00-$2.00 more), or buy them whole and use one of those hard boiled egg slicers ...And it keeps the slicing thickness consistent.

Definitely try this recipe, you'll love it.  If it doesn't come out perfect the first time (and it will, but if you feel it didn't), don't be discouraged to try it again.

All these suggestions are very nice-if you want to splurge (on calories) and have a decadent meal. But don't miss out on the chance to try it without all the added fat. I have made this recipe many times and with a non-stick pan you can omit the butter and halve (or omit) the oil and it's still quite good. I've also made it with and without flour, and it works either way.  Also, with a thinner sauce, you can slice up some warm French bread and use that to soak up the extra sauce on your plate-yummy and you don't even need butter!

Chicken Marsala is a family favorite. This Marsala recipe is easy and delicious. The flour gives the chicken a silky coating and thickens the sauce nicely. I made only one change- I reduced the amount of oregano, a half tsp is too much in my opinion. Well done and Thank you for sharing.
 PS: Good quality wines (Marsala and Sherry) are vital. The previous reviewer was correct, avoid "cooking wines"; if they are not good enough to drink, they are not good enough to cook with.

This is a wonderful classic recipe! After reading some of the reviews I followed their advice and put the seasonings and flour in a bag to coat the chicken.  I used all marsala wine for the sauce and doubled the amount of mushrooms.  I removed the chicken from the pan while making the sauce and added a little half and half to it to make it creamy - it turned out great.  I have made this three times now and have finally got around to reviewing it. This is a definite keeper!

This is, by far, the best chicken marsala recipe I have ever encountered.  My husband found it here two years ago, and we have made it and enjoyed it often ever since.  We usually double the wines, using fine (sweet) Marsala wine and a dry white Sherry, which leaves us extra sauce for the angel hair pasta we serve with it.  We also use mushrooms of the Portabella variety.  Thank you Lisa!

I thought this was good, but I could tell just by the ingredients that it was going to need some doctoring up.  I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and lots of salt and pepper to the flour mixture. I cut back on the oil and butter- about 2 heaping tablespoons each.  Plus, I sauteed crushed garlic in the oil and butter before adding the chicken. It turned out great.  My stepdaughter loved it.  I served it with angel hair pasta and broccoli.  But I think I may add cream to it at the end, like one reviewer suggested, to make more 'gravy'. It needed more sauce for the pasta. All in all, this is great! (Edited 5/22/2010)

My boyfriend and I LOVED this.  I made it with lots of baby portabello mushrooms, and I also threw onions and garlic in with the butter and oil before I placed the chicken in.  I also doubled the sauce like others.  I took the chicken out when it was done cooking, added corn starch and a little heavy cream to the sauce and it was just how we liked it.  I served with mashed garlic red potatoes, I think its our new favorite dinner! :)

What a wonderful recipe. I made this for a large group of family and friends who returned to my house after my daughters' dance recital. Because of the amount I needed, after sauteing the chicken, everything was then cooked in the oven. I did add some chicken broth to the sauce and thickened with cornstarch once it was done.

I was looking for a "formal" recipe to serve visiting family and gave this a first-run serving with DH and DS prior to the visit.  I followed many of the suggestions given:  added 1 tsp dry Italian salad dressing packet to flour, using only Marsala wine and doubling the amount of wine & shrooms, cornstarch slurry, remove the chicken after browning and transferring to a casserole dish while making the sauce, add cream at the end of the reduction and LOTS of salt, pepper and a bit of chicken stock then poured the whole bit over the chicken and baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  We'll see how it goes.  It was good, but definitely needed tweaking.  Goes well with a White Merlot.

To Jillia and anyone else wondering "why brown it if you're going to drown it", the answer is simple, and to an experienced cook, should be obvious; for the flavor! Especially if you're adding garlic & onion.  The flour & butter will also combine and help give your sauce some body.  I suggest after browning the chicken, remove it from the pan, saute your onion and/or garlic and any herbs till they begin to brown, then deglaze the pan with the marsala, scraping up any brown bits in the bottom of the pan. This is where all the flavor is! THEN you want to add the chicken, mushroons etc.  Just for the record, I am not the same Lisa as the author of this recipe. Seems a little bland as written, I'll be adding garlic onion and thyme to my version ;)  Enjoy

Totally stellar.  This is a classic, trattoria quality, chicken Marsala recipe -- the way I expect a Marsala sauce to taste (forget all those chain Italian restaurant Marsala sauces - this is the real thing). I made no changes to the recipe -- except for the fact that I didn't have cooking sherry (yuck anyway) and substituted Marsala instead.  I don't really understand why anyone would want to thicken the sauce with cream or a cornstarch slurry -- it's a wine reduction, after all.  Also, I like the fact that every strand of linguine mingles with the sauce.  My experience of a great Marsala is that it is subtle in its richness and really lets the flavor of fresh pasta shine, without overpowering or sitting like a congealed glob on top of everything.  This recipe, for me and my family, really measured up to our expectations.

Last night I made this for the 4th time. And now it's a 5+ star for our family!  Here's what I do. I cook the chicken (clean) in 1 T each of butter and olive oil first. (I did the whole flour thing but decided it doesn't add to it at all). Cook until the chicken is still pink in the middle. (That's important!) Then take out and set aside. Then I cook 1 to 2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms (2 cups if you love mushrooms like we do) in 2 T butter and 2 to 3 cloves fresh minced garlic. (not more or you'll smell like garlic all night). Then add in 1 cup wine, no sherry. Add 1 can cream of chicken soup. (I tried cream of mushroom but don't like the fake mushrooms in the soup mixed with the fresh ones! ugh). Then I add 2 to 3 T heavy whipping cream. Then add a mixture of 1 T melted butter with 1 T flour, mixed smooth. This really adds thickness to the sauce. Stir well under medium heat until hot. Add the chicken back to this and simmer covered for 10 to 15 minutes. This makes the chicken ultra moist and not overcooked and dry. So take it out while it's still pink in the middle.  It's tough to do but necessary. I serve with either rice or fettuccine and petite peas with pearl onions.  As an afterthought, next time I'm going to add in a few fresh basil leaves, slivered, to the mushroom sauce. Yum! Thanks for the great starter recipe Lisa.

YUMMY! I put the flour, salt, pepper and oregano in a bag, and then put the chicken in to coat. I cut the amount of butter and oil in half. After chicken was browned, I took out and put in casserole dish, put the mushrooms, wines(doubled the amount of wines), some garlic, chicken broth, and cornstarch (to thicken the sauce a little)simmered in the pan for about 5 minutes, the poured on top of chicken. Covered it then put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Served on top of angel hair spagetti....soooooooo good!

After reading reviews, I added ingredients, which made this AMAZING!   Put 1 chicken breast at a time in a large plastic bag & pound with the back of a saucepan, for evenness. In another large plastic bag, put flour mixture, adding 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon dried basil & 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley (reserve 3 tablespoons, to thicken sauce). Can prepare up to this stage, the day before. Brown chicken in only 2 tablespoons butter & 2 tablespoons oil then remove from pan. In same pan, saute 1 diced onion & 2 cups of sliced mushrooms. Add 1 tablespoon chopped garlic the last 3 minutes, so the garlic doesn't burn. Use triple the amount of good quality Marsala & sherry. Add 3/4 cup cream (I use 1/2 and 1/2).  Shake together 4½ oz. of chicken broth ( can freeze leftover carton) & 3 tablespoons of the seasoned, reserved flour. Add roux to pan & simmer 20 minutes, to reduce & thicken. Put chicken back in pan & simmer, covered, 10 minutes. Serve over broad noodles.

Truly a FABULOUS dish. Very simple and elegant meal. My personal modifications: Lightly browned 6 chicken breasts as per recipe (pounding out the meat, dredging in flour and seasonings and adding to butter and olive oil). After about 1 1/2 to 2 min per side, removed to a dish and poured over remaining pan juices. Clean out the skillet. Added another 4 T butter and 4 T olive oil and sauteed 2 8-oz boxes sliced baby bella mushrooms (rinsed of course), 4 finely chopped shallots and about a teaspoon (or 2?) of minced garlic. After about 4 min. I added 1 cup marsala, 1/2 cup sherry (not cooking variety) and 1/2 can chicken broth (I added the other 1/2 can into the pot of water in which the egg noodles later cooked). I returned the chicken to the skillet and let simmer in the sauce (without covering with a lid). All throughout - from browning the chicken to simmering the chicken in the sauce, I layered the seasoning - adding a bit more salt and seasoned pepper and continued to grind italian seasonings throughout the cooking. Served with buttered egg noodles. Absolutely heavenly. Thank you, Lisa, for submitting and sharing with us. You've made thousands of people very, very happy!

This was good but not great.  I'm terrible at flattening meat and poultry so I didn't bother.  I didn't add mushrooms either as my fiance hates them.  The chicken was tender and flavor pretty good but I like the marsala dishes more from my favorite Italian restaurant.  My fiance was neutral on this.  I doubt I'll make it again.

simple. easy. but a bit bland. The 2nd time I added garlic, onion, and italian spice. Put the chicken in eggs before the flour mixture. Used a 3rd of the oil and butter. Tripled the marsala and sherry. Doubled the mushrooms. After removing the chicken I added a little of the flour mixture to thicken.

My hubby is European and VERY picky about his food. But after this dish I got a backrub AND he drew me a bath! If only you knew him... this recipe is nothing short of a miracle! Thanks Lisa!

This is fantastic. I have been searching for a great recipe...this is it.  I did follow advise from others:  half of the butter and oil, added more mushrooms, used onions, sauted mushrooms and onions prior to adding, added a clove of garlic when wine went in.  I used marsala wine but did not use the sherry. I also used Wondra in place of all purpose flour. I used a pinor noir we had opened for dinner. My husband went gaga for this dish...definitely will make again.

This was easy and delicious.  I took the advice of several others and used 1/2 the oil and butter; added lots more mushrooms, using portabello and white mushrooms; added 1/2 cup of chicken broth thickened with cornstarch to thicken the sauce some.  I planned to add a few cloves of garlic as some others suggested, but forgot until everything was simmering, so I added a few pinches of garlic powder instead.  I served it with Bella Rosemary Red Potatoes (a recipe from this site) and broccoli.  Everyone loved it!

Great dish! Not quite as good as the restaurant but it will certainly be made again and again at my house.  I followed the directions exactly and I found I didn't need to add anything to get a rich brown sauce with it.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough sauce!  To make more I doubled the marsala and sherry, threw in the rest of the container of mushrooms and added in about 2 tbsp of milk and cornstarch.  Also, when it started simmering I added in 1/2 small sliced onion and 1 clove minced garlic. Perfection!  Served with a side of angel hair pasta.

I only rate recipes that I follow EXACTLY because once you make changes, you are no longer rating this recipe!! This was one of the best recipes I have made from this site. It was easy (1 skillet) and fast. It's a keeper!

My husband and I found this dish to be simply delicious.  I have found, however, that cooking chicken quickly on the stove results in rather tough meat.  So, I followed the recipe with the exception that after all the ingredients were added to the pan and heated through, I transfered everything to a baking dish, cooked it in the oven at 300 degrees for 1 hr.  As a result, the chicken was very tender and the sauce was very nice also.  I do agree that some additional spices should/could be added to the flour mixture.  All and all, this is a great dish!

Are you kidding me?!?!  I am still amazed at how easy this recipe was to make and how tasty it was.  I've made this twice now.  I made a just a few modifications.  I bought thinly sliced chicken breasts, which saved me even more time. I dipped the chicken in egg and then dredged it in flour.  I cooked them in the oil and when I was ready to turn them over I added minced garlic and capers to the oil butter mixture as well as almost double the mushrooms the recipe calls for (I love mushrooms).  To compensate for the extra ingredients I did add 2 tablespoons more butter.  I serve it over angel hair pasta. The second time around I doubled the sauce recipe so there would be enough to go along with the pasta.  This version is better than any restaurant.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was GREAT! I made a couple of changes that worked perfect. I added some garlic powder and salt and pepper to the flour and added about a half of a can of chicken broth to the marsala and sherry, then I removed the chicken and added about a tablespoon of wondra flour mix, and whisked it for a few minutes, then added the chicken back to the pan. It thickened the wine sauce, and made a little more. I also think the kind of marsala and sherry you use is VERY  important. I used "Florio" sweet marsala wine, and I used "Cribari" california sherry. I went to a liquor store where I know the manager who is VERY knowledgeable about what kinds of wines and liquors to cook with. He sells to many fancy restaurants in the area. He highly recomended both. He was right, because it came out AWSOME! My children ages 10 and 14 don't usually like chicken marsala, but they loved this! I served it with buttered noodles and summer squash. This was a perfect weeknight meal, I will definately be making it again!

Bland. Needs less butter/oil, more mushrooms. I'd also recommend adding corn starch and cream as several others have suggested.

I rated this recipe in April of 2006.  A friend of mine wanted this recipe, I told her how to sign up and go under my reviews.  After reading the recipe she called me up about the review from Luv2CookDinner about the wine to use. Luv2CookDinner is right, do not use a cooking sherry or cooking wine ever.  This will distract from the taste.  Use a wine or sherry depending on the recipe that you would serve to a guest whether it be dry or sweet.  (Original Review)  I've been meaning to rate this for a long time.  Just now getting to my ratings.  This was excellent.  I didn't change a thing.  If I did it would be to reduce the sodium level as my husband now has to watch his salt intake.  But as it is it's not to bad.  Thanks for the great post.

I wanted to make chicken marsala tonight for dinner, and came across this recipe.  Since there were so many mixed reviews I was a little leary.  I decided to go onto Olive Garden's website and find the recipe they use.  I did and this is it, minus the sherry.  I was planning on omitting the sherry anyway, and followed the recipe otherwise to a T.  Absolutely delicious, just like Olive Garden (minus the price.)

This is a great recipe. I have used it for at least 10 years as a company menu. Makes an elegant, quick dinner.  I usually saute green peppers and onions along with the mushrooms. Also good made ahead and reheated. The marsala wine marinates into the chicken for a delicious taste. I have not tried it with the sherry but I am sure it is great.

OK, this is the best Marsala recipe we've ever tried. The second time we tried this recipe, I made a huge sandwhich with it. After slightly hollowing out a large loag of Italian bread, I first drizzled olive oil, placed a layer of provalone chesse, then the chicken, a layer of mozarella cheese folowed by the mushrooms, a few slices of red and green pepper, more provalone.  Now squish everything down so the bread will close. Wrap the sandwhich in aluminum foil, and heat in a 350 degree oven till the cheese melts. Yummmmmmm!

This is really good. The first time we made this it was sooooo greasy!! DEFINITELY cut the butter and oil in half. The second time we made it we added more mushrooms, onion, minced garlic, half the oil and butter, and cream at the end. 

Fantastic!

Lisa, this was delicious.  I've never made Chicken Marsala before and was surpised by how quick and easy this was.  Next time, I'd let my chicken get a tiny bit more crispy before adding the wines.  I agree with other reviewers about using good marsala and sherry.  I used fit and trim chicken breasts already cut thin and trimmed well and they turned out perfect--saved me the step of pounding out the breasts.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe-one word of caution...if you should use cooking marsala instead of straight marsala, make sure you cut the salt out of the ingredients, as cooking marsala contains salt.
I didn't have Sherry so I used a little chicken broth, and it was very good!

I love chicken Marsala and oddly enough, so does my picky husband, although he will pick out the mushrooms.  Just more for me.  I added extra mushrooms like everyone suggested and really think they are the best part of the meal.  I didn't add any corn starch to thicken, just boiled it down.  I also didn't have any sherry and only used Marsala.  It tasted great.  I will make again for sure.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I didn't have cooking sherry so i just added more marsala wine. Next time though, i think i will cut the oil and butter in half. there was a lot of grease left in the pan after cooking that i didnt want in the sauce.

Great recipe. The oregano is essential to the overall flavour. I use only Marsala wine (no sherry) and add cream to taste to the sauce at the end to give it that great creamy flavour. If cooking in quantity is best to divide the butter and oil so as not to have the first pieces of chicken soaked with oil while the last pieces are basically dry frying. Also if cooking in quantity have a warmed oven dish in the oven and add the chicken pieces to keep warm. Return the chicken to the pan or if too much chicken, cook the mushrooms and sauce and then add that to the oven dish and bake for around half an hour depending on quantity. A favourite.

I made some changes as did other reviewers:  I used all marsala (no sherry), added chopped onion and garlic, extra mushrooms (4 c.) and doubled the sauce. I will definitely try it again with a few more changes: I will cut butter/oil down to 2 T. each (a little too oily) and double the flour coating because I thought it needed more seasoning... I had to salt and pepper mine.

Fast and very easy...good for a new cook! I added more mushrooms since we are big mushroom fans in the house and it was great. The sauce was very tasty too. The only thing I forgot to do was to pound the chicken breasts...which was probably why it wasn't as tender as I thought it'd be. Next time I will definately flatten them out and I'm sure that they'll be tender. The baby even enjoyed the sauce over fettecine and DH really liked it...he said it was resturant quality! This will be a keeper in our household. Thanks for posting the recipe Lisa!

this was very good, I did make some changes which made it even better. I only used 2 chicken breast halves, cut in half and pounded thin. Used 2 tablespoons Olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter to cook the chicken, and added 1 tablespoon butter to the sauce for richness. I used 3 cups mushrooms (will probably use  4 next time) and 3 cloves garlic. I also increased the marsala to 1 cup and no sherry, and 1 cup chicken broth, which made just enough sauce, I also thicked the sauce with some of the leftover seasoned flour. After I cooked the alcohol out and reduced the sauce to consistency I was looking for I added the chicken back in covered and simmered while I was cooked the pasta. delish!

This recipe will make your whole house smell like a great restaurant. Very good and super easy. I did make a small change after reading other reviews. I added approximately 3 tbsp of heavy cream, about 1 tsp of minced garlic (jar) and a bit of cornstarch just to thicken the sauce a little. I also removed my chicken and cooked the mushrooms then added the chicken back in. It was just easier for me. Thanks for posting!

I've made this numerous times and it always tastes great! I add a little flour in the later stages of cooking for a thicker gravy. My wife's fellow workers beg for me to make some for them!

Great recipe, definitely give this one a try. Slight as they may be, I did make a few changes I’d recommend to others. MY CHANGES: I added ½ tsp. basil to the flour mixture and placed it in a Ziploc bag to coat each chicken piece individually – far less clean up. I also increased the pepper to ½ tsp.  I browned the chicken for about 4 minutes on each side and then placed in the oven at 400 on a greased cookie sheet for 20 minutes. I doubled the sliced mushrooms and added 6 cloves of finely chopped fresh garlic, and one medium white onion, diced. I added the garlic and onion to the butter/oil first and once the aroma was to die for I added the mushrooms. I cooked until tender then added ¾ cup marsala and omitted the sherry (didn’t have any on hand). After the 20 min in the oven I put the chicken back into the skillet with the sauce and added just a dash of heavy cream. Covered, reduced heat and simmered. I served it over linguine and it was to die for and the chicken was VERY tender. Only other thing I would change is next time I will definitely at least double the sauce. It’s so good I caught my husband mopping up what was left in the pan with a chunk of bread!

Wow. 4tbsp of butter AND 4 tbsp of olive oil? I used 1 tbsp of olive oil, no butter. Also used low sodium chicken broth rather than sherry, and used 4 tbsp of marsala. Tastes WONDERFUL and only 5 WW points per 4oz breast as opposed to 11.

UNREAL.  We eat this all the time with a cheap bottle of marsala from a local Italian bakery.  I always double the sauce and the mushrooms and add scallions and a touch of heavy cream.  It is SO much better than restaurant recipes.  Make sure to pound the chicken well (I use one of my five pound hand weights, lol!)

I made this dish last night and it was excellent, however, I made a few already alterations culled from other reviews:

1. I added one clove of garlic to the butter/oil mix in which I sauteed the chicken to add a little more flavor.

2. I sauteed the chicken to completion, removed it, and then prepared the mushrooms and sauce before adding back the chicken for more simmering.

3. If you like things at all saucy, you must AT LEAST double the sherry and marsala wine.

4. I doubled the number of mushrooms and should have tripled them.

5. I doubled the amount of flour, oregano, and ground pepper, and I added some basil into the mix but I should have increased the salt a bit (although this will be a personal preference).


Bottom line: I think the recipe as it is written is good, but might be a bit on the dry and bland side.  We like sauce and spice so doubling selected ingredients (as above) really tilted the recipe in our direction.

Did not care for this at all - cooking the browned chicken in the wine sauce just made it taste boiled - yuk.

Delicious. I do make a few changes, however. I caramelize a red onion in a small amount of oil. I use small crimini mushrooms and leave them whole or simply halve them to give them a more meaty texture. I double the amount of mushrooms called for. Also, use fresh Oregano in the flour mixture and dip the chicken in plain flour, egg and then the seasoned flour before frying to give it more of a crispy texture. Pounding the chicken flat piard style also helps it cook evenly. Use 1 cup of marsala or more. Cook the mushrooms, onions and chicken in the same pan at different times and use the marsala to deglaze while the mushrooms are cooking. Add the onions back to the pan and reduce the whine down by at least half. Add the chicken in, turn to coat and finish cooking it through. Serve over angel hair with a cream sauce. Parm on the side.

I followed several of the other recommendations by tripling the sauce, adding more mushrooms, cream and a little corn starch to thicken.  AND I bought really good sweet marsala wine (not marsala cooking wine...it does make a huge difference.  My husband loved this recipe.  Thanks Lisa and fellow reviewers...this one is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe. My family loved it!  Instead of simmering, I browned the chicken in a skillet then placed the browned pieces in a preheated slow cooker. Covered and alllowed to steam while I sauteed the mushrooms in the skillet. I added the wine and sherry to mushrooms and allowed sauce to reduce. Then added to the chicken in the slow cooker. Chicken was fork tender and the sauce thickened a bit.  Received great compliments. Will make again.

Sacred cows, this is fantastic!  I, like others before me, have doubled, nay, tripled the mushroom count in this recipe, and also have added cream to make the sauce thicker.  Other than that - just grabbed a decent California Marsala wine for about $6.00 or so, and I didn't use the cooking sherry, it turned out GREAT.  Served it over a nice pile of angel hair pasta.

I DEFINITELY suggest making extra sauce, as the chicken comes out nice and moist, but the noodles are, well...... noodles and they need some sauce.

Very good dinner recipe and it took me about 1 hour total, from start to finish, to prepare and cook and serve!

Loved it as did everyone else.  I doubled the chicken, pounded and cut each breast once pounded into 3 nice pieces.  I tripled the sauce and used chicken broth in place of sherry. While browning chicken, I added equal parts butter/oil as needed until all chicken was done browning.  Added two 8oz cartons of sliced mushrooms to pan, marsala and chicken broth.  Thickened mixture a bit w/chicken broth and reserved flour used for dredging chicken. Swirled an extra TBLS or two of butter into the sauce at the very end.  Also added some salt and fresh ground pepper and a bit of fresh parsley.   Put all in an aluminum pan and finished later in the oven so I could serve it hot when needed for my guests.  It was great.  Recipe is a great start (or just as is) with room to add your own touch to it.  Thank you for sharing!  This website has made me a pretty darn good cook! Enjoy!

Excellent dish.  I read what other reviewers wrote and took their suggestions when making this dish. I used a paperbag and used it to coat the seasoning mix. I also placed the butter into 1/3 c olive oil and melted it before adding the chicken. I then took the chicken out and place it on the side while I continued making the sauce. I decided to use 1 cup of marsala wine. I found a sweet marsala wine for $12. I added a clove of garlic, minced, along with the mushrooms which were cut in half into the skillet. I let it cook a few minutes before adding a little heavy cream. I then thickened it up a by adding some cornstarch with water. I then added the chicken back into the sauce and I let it simmer before adding it to the pasta. It is a wonderful dish I plan on making again.

A simple classic dish that will have you wanting more. I omitted the cooking sherry and added 3/4 cup of the marsala wine as suggested by a reviewer. Perfecto!

This recipe is pretty good as is, but I prefer to knock back the butter considerably and halve the oil.  Some chopped up garlic is a welcome addition, which I generally will add after turning the chicken the first time to prevent burning of the garlic.  Amount to suit your tastes that day (plenty if you don't have important people to meet in the next day or two)  :-)

I don't bother with the sherry, and sometimes instead of using marsala, I will substitute some good quality beer.  There are many different varieties of beer that work well with it, depending on what you have on hand.  I'm not talking about your average fizzy yellow lager here.  Porter, saison/biere de garde or a Flanders red ale are most suitable to my tastes.

This goes well with fried (or over roasted) quartered tiny little potatos, or grilled asparagus.

WOW!  This was a fantastic recipe... both relatively inexpensive and quick to put together, this is a keeper for sure.  The flavor was so incredible - as others have said, at least as good as most restaurant versions.  
I followed others' advice and changed a few things:  I halved the butter/oil combinatino; sauteed sliced red onions before adding the chicken to brown; doubled the wine and ended up adding a bit of sherry as well; mixed 1 T cornstarch and 1 T cold water and then added along with a dash of milk to the sauce to thicken; and added minced garlic and extra mushrooms with the chicken - just incredible!  I made this with steamed red potatoes and veggies, a quick caesar salad and voila - dinner for two!

I wasn't preparing chicken, but pork chops on the grill and wanted the mushrooms marsala sauce to pour over the chops. I used 3 Tbs. butter, 3 Tbs. olive oil and melted them together. Then I added the mushrooms and some sliced onions to the pan. In a bowl I mixed the recommended marsala wine, sherry, and about a Tbs. of cornstarch and whisked it all together. Then I poured it over the mushrooms and onions, covered it, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. OH MY GOD, YUM! It thickened up perfectly and I poured this over the pork chops hot off the grill. My husband was without words. We both agreed this was better than any marsala sauce we've had in any restaurant! There were NO leftovers!

The recipe is great! Reference comments by other viewers, I used less butter and olive oil; lots of three kinds of fresh mushrooms; used good quality Marsala and sherry; cut pounded chicken pieces into medallions and dipped them in Eggbeaters before dredging in flour mixture; threw in some capers; added chicken broth for more sauce; and stirred in whipping cream before serving on top of angel hair pasta sprinkled with fresh parsley. Entire dinner included cold heart of palm soup, spinach salad with apricots, blueberries, green onion, toasted almonds and burgundy poppy seed dressing. Dessert was Kentucky butter cake. Guests were duly impressed with this special dinner.

I love chicken marsala and have been searching for one similar to the one I had in a little pizza shop on Long Island,N.Y.There's is the best I ever had. This comes close.I added 1/2 tsp.garlic and omitted sherry. Added 12 oz. mushrooms.Tasted wonderful,but as mushrooms cooked it weakened sauce. I added 1/2 chicken broth mixed with 1 T flour to thicken.I think next time I will double or tripple sauce so there is enough to pour over rice.This is really tasty but I will experiment with this to try to make it like the one I had in N.Y. Thanks Lisa for sharing.

Just like a restaurant's and gobbled down by the whole family.  Kids love to pound the chicken.  Agree with other reviewers - definitely double the sauce and the mushrooms.

This gets five stars because it was SO easy to prepare and tasted wonderful. I appreciated the comments of another reviewer who suggested using an egg slicer for the mushrooms-- that worked well and saved some time. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added some minced garlic to the mushrooms and about a 1/4 tsp crushed rosemary to the seasoned flour. I also doubled the wine so there would be extra sauce, and thickened it at the end with a flour/ water slurry. My husband felt that the sherry was a little overpowering, so next time I will make it with all Marsala. Overall, great, easy recipe. I will make this again.

I agree with many other reviewers. This is an excellent recipe.  Next time I make this I will cut back on the butter and olive oil.  I think 2 T of each is enough to brown the chicken. I used a lot of mushrooms. They seem to release water when cooking and dilute the flavor of the sauce a bit. I think this dish has a delicate flavor. I didn't think it was bland.  I served mine over a bed of well salted thin spaghetti and enjoyed it very much. Next time I think I will make it much healthier by serving the chicken with a plate of steamed vegetables like carrots, peas, broccoli, and green onion. I should also add that the chicken breast was very tender as well.  Thank you for an excellent recipe. And many thanks to the other reviewers for their suggestions as well.

This is the most delicious and easy recipe I have made with chicken. I always order chicken marsala in restaurants so I decided to give it a try at home. My husband and I loved it. It was a great hit and so easy to make. I followed some of the other advice and added twice the amount of wine. sherry and mushrooms. The mushrooms were from a box and a bit hard so I will stick to the recommended amount next time. I also took the chicken out after it was cooked and continued to cook the sauce. I also added some chicken stock and corn starch to make a thicker gravy. Thank you for all the suggestions. This recipe is well on its way to becoming a family favorite in my house.

Yum, Yum, Yummy! the only thing I added was fresh minced garlic to the mushrooms and added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth mixed with a TBS of flour to make a thin gravy/ thick sauce. I served this over garlic butter egg noodles. The chicken was SO moist!

I made this recipe today.  It was really good.  I cooked the mushrooms, onions and garlic in butter first.  Took them out of the pan then fried the chicken until brown. Took the chicken out and then cooked the marsala and chicken broth with corn starch to thicken.  Added the mushroom mix and chicken  back in pan.  Turned out great with plenty of gravy.

I made this with the few changes I read in the reviews. I took the chicken out after browning and then did the mushrooms and onions.  Stirred in the Marsala Wine only did not use the other.  Also added a few cloves of Garlic.  After the mushrooms and onions were cooked a little while put the chicken back in for about min's.  Then I removed the chicken and thickened the sauce with cornstarch and water mix. It was very Yummy!  Will make again and my husband does not like boneless chicken breasts thinks they are dry and have tried many recipes and this one he loved!

Very tasty.  I cut the recipe down to a serving for one with the exception that I used 1 1/2 cups of mushrooms, 1/4 cup marsala wine, and a splash of sherry, because I wanted lots of sauce and mushrooms.  It was very good.  I did saute a small about of onion & 2 cloves of garlic in the butter/oil mix before adding the chicken.  I would make this again.

This turned out delicious, though I agree with other reviewers it would have been bland without some additions.  

I cut down on the butter but kept the oil the same.  I also added 2 garlic cloves to the oil/butter to give it some extra flavor.  I also added basil to the flour mixure to give is some extra flavor. 

I also need more sauce so ended up doubling the sauce after the chicken was already cooked.  I used the marsala, sherry, butter, oil, oregano, basil, garlic and more mushrooms for the suace.  I also added some milk to it to make it creamier.  It turned out great for what I needed.

Love, love, love this recipe! It's the closest thing I've found to the version I love in a local restaurant. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used a good quality sweet Marsala, doubled the sauce & mushrooms and added a bit of half & half and cornstarch/water mixture to thicken. Next time I think I made the mistake of doubling the olive oil & butter when I doubled the sauce, but I definitely did not need to do so as it was quite oily. Will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites!

This was fantastic.  Like other reviewers, I added a bit of minced garlic (1 clove) when adding the mushrooms.  I omitted the sherry (didn't have any) and increased the marsala to 3/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup chicken broth. I also thickened the sauce using about 1/4 cup cream with about a tbstp of cornstarch.  Excellent!

Fabulous recipe! Some changes I made: marinated the chicken in Marsala & garlic, added fresh garlic & onions, used two cups of Marsala and 1 cup of heavy cream. Served over mashed potatoes made with parmesan, oregano, garlic powder and fresh parsley.

loved the trick about pounding the chicken in a ziploc bag, no mess. doubled the sherry and marsala wine, & also added a few garlic cloves(sliced thin) and a couple sprigs of rosemary. tried a mushroom bonanza with morels, shitake, and garden variety...turned out AMAZING! great recipe and low maintenance with high taste!

Much better than I expected, especially after tasting the marsala straight. (I am SO not a wine drinker. Ick.) But after fully cooked, this was pretty delish. I did remove the chicken from the skillet after browning, placing it in a warm oven to rest. I added diced shallots with my mushrooms, and finished the sauce with a very healthy dash of heavy cream. Served with whole wheat fettuccini, with sides of red grapes and soft cheese on crackers. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

i made this for my boyfriend and myself the other night and it was absolutely delicious! for some reason my supermarket had neither the cooking sherry nor the marsala wine, so instead i took a guess and grabbed a bottle of red cooking wine - thankfully it turned out to be a good guess: the dish was fabulous! to make up for the missing wine, i added a bit of rosemary and garlic, and it was so yummy! the aroma was amazing and the flavours were simply bursting out of it! thankyou for a lovely recipe, will definitely be making this again!

This was very good.  I was not going to deviate from the recipe except for the addition of garlic but at the last minute I just had to thicken the sauce. I removed the chicken and kept it warm and then added about 1 tbsp of flour mixed with approx 1/4 cup of marsala wine and a couple tbsp of heavy cream up to a boil then down to a simmer and put the chicken back in the sauce and served immeadiately over angel hair pasta.  I did not regret this change.   Thank you Lisa for this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! If you’re planning to serve it over pasta (which works really well), I recommend doubling the sauce but easing up on the oil.  (The oil can mute the flavors and texture of the dish.) Otherwise, stick to the recipe and it’s easy and delicious.

I took ORCHIDS13's advice and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the sauce after cooking the chicken, used extra marsala rather than sherry, and doubled the mushrooms... and Oh My Goodness, was this delicious!  I also used six tenderloins without adjusting any other measurements, but we had plenty of sauce.  I served it with garlic 'smashed' potatoes and broccoli.  It came very close to rivalling my favorite restaurant's chicken marsala and will definately be one of my favorite dishes to make.

This recipe was excellent.  I made a few changes:
- Reduced butter and olive oil by half
- Added garlic to the hot oil and garlic before adding the chicken
- Skipped the Sherry and used 1 cup of Marsala
- Used 2 cups of Mushrooms

This was delicious. I used chicken tenders instead of breast, and I didn't flatten them. I also added 1 tsp of cornstarch at the end to thicken up the glaze. My very finicky kids, who don't even like mushrooms, ate this with no complaints. Plus, it was super fast, a bonus for us busy moms.

The Chicken Marsala part of this recipe was absolutely delicious.  I doubled the mushrooms, Marsala wine, and sherry to make extra sauce.  However, I served it over angel hair pasta and even with some of the marsala sauce poured over it, the pasta seemed blah.  I might follow some other reviewers' advice and add heavy cream to the sauce at the end of the cooking time. **UPDATED 11/27/07 Served this with brown rice and it was much better.  The rice seemed to soak up the marsala sauce.  I still forgot to add the splash of heavy cream at the end, and I still think it needs it, to be honest.  The sauce needs to be a bit richer.

A great chicken marsala recipe, super easy too!  I made this dish over pasta in less than 30 minutes.  I cut the chicken breasts into medallions to speed up cooking, and doubled the mushrooms, marsala and sherry - since we like a saucy pasta.  I think it added more marsala flavor too.  When the chicken was completely cooked through, I added a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream to make the sauce creamy.  It turned out perfect, just like we've had at restaurants!  A definite keeper!

Let me start off by saying that this is my favorite dish to eat.  I've tried many chicken marsala recipes but none compares to this. It's so easy and delicious!! I make it often and have never had to put away leftovers--It's a HUGE hit.  Thanks lisa.

I hate to say it, but this was horrible.  I love Chicken Marsala, but had I been served this in a restaurant I would have sent it back.  The wine taste was overwhelmingly strong.  I even let it simmer for a while longer hoping it would burn off, but it didn't.  This was a real disappointment.  I've even made chicken marsala with Holland House marsala and canned mushrooms and it tasted better than this.

My husband (who is not a big fan of mushrooms or Italian food, in general) absolutely LOVED this dish. I took several notes from previous reviewers and made a few changes. I completely omitted the Sherry (didn't see a need for it alongside the Marsala). Added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and lessened the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Increased the Marsala wine to 1 cup and mixed it with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken the sauce (to go over my pasta). After browning the chicken, I removed it from the skillet and sauteed the mushrooms and a couple of gloves of minced garlic, and then returned the chicken to the skillet to simmer. If you want a milder alcohol taste, try adding 1-2 tablespoons of chicken broth. It helped. And, it turned out delicious!!!

Love this recipe.  I have to admit that I didn't use the sherry at all but used the Marsala wine.  I cut the chicken breasts in half after pounding them so that they cook a bit faster and are easier to turn over without disturbing the breading.  I also made double the sauce, just because it's so wonderful!  I've served this a couple of times for dinner parties and have gotten rave reviews.  Better than ANY restaurant!

I have been making Chicken Marsala for years and served it as a special dish to my family. This is a very good recipe but due to the fact that I have to watch my sodium I use Marsala (3/4) cup and don't use any of the cooking sherry as cooking sherry has lot's of sodium in it. But this is just me, others may not have a sodium problem. Still a great recipe!

We skipped the sherry on this and added extra Marsala--it was absolutely amazing! The recipe is super easy to follow, but you don't even have to measure it out. After making this one time, you can just eyeball the ingredients and adjust to your own taste. Since we love mushrooms, we about tripled the mushrooms in the recipe, as well. This is going into our collection of staples--I could probably eat it every night of the week!

While I would follow the advice of other reviewers who removed the chicken before adding the mushrooms, I would NOT add cream or any other thickening agent as some other reviewers have suggested. If you are patient and just let the wine reduce, it creates a thick, luscious sauce that doesn't need to be thickened at all. You just add the chicken pieces back for a few minutes to warm them up before serving.

I've been looking for a great recipe to try to make this at home since we love chicken (and veal) marsala. This was so easy and was the best I've ever had - the better half told me that same..the only change I made was used all Marsala (and a good quality one), added extra plus doubled the mushrooms and added a little garlic when I sauteed the mushrooms. Per other reviews, i removed the chicken before doing the mushrooms, then put it back in. Served it over fettucini with a side of asparagus. YUM! Will make this over and over..

Delicious. You can't really mess up chicken marsala. The only change I made was to use less oil/butter. Way too much in the recipe. And I used chicken tenders instead of pounded breasts. Served with fettuccine and broccoli.

Delicious!  My husband was actually chair dancing while eating this dish.  I took the advice from other reviewers and modified just a bit.  First, I sauteed the chicken in the butter and olive oil and removed from pan.  Then, I sauteed the mushrooms  (doubled .. could have tripled) with a clove of minced garlic and a little more oregano.  I used one cup of marsala wine and thickened with cornstarch and added a little half and half.  I put the chicken back in the sauce to heat through  and served over linguini.  Fantastic, Lisa!!  Thanks!!

Very good! Very quick! I shall be making this again & again. I omited the sherry because I don't care for sherry. I used marsala cooking wine. Gordon Ramsay says it's OK to cook with cheap wine, yes? Glad I did, because it knocked off about $8 extra dollars (and we're all looking for inexpensive meals to put on the table) I would have spent on the wine. Instead of keeping it all in the skillet, I removed the chicken and placed it in a 350 oven to finish cooking. I then put the marsala, mushrooms in the skillet with the remaining oils and such, then eyeballed chicken stock and heavy cream. I added a roux of cornstarch & water and it thickened it up soooo nicely! Poured those succulent mushrooms on top of the chicken. Delish!

WOW!~!! Thanks for helping me impress myself;;) lol This was such an easy and aromatic recipe, it will defiantely be a keeper for when company arrives. I did use a tad less Sherry and more marsala as I prefer those balances. I also added a quick slurry of the remaining flour (less than 1/4cup) and skim milk(1/4cup) to my doubled recipe for a bit creamier texture that I am more accustomed to. Thank you again for sharing such a great recipe!

Quick and easy and even better with a few modifications. After I browned the chicken with some garlic cloves, I took it out and proceeded to cook the mushroom wine sauce. Somebody already said it but I'll say it again, why brown it if you're just going to drown it? Anyway, I left out the sherry and added a chicken bouillon cube or two and some heavy cream at the end (I rarely measure anything). Served it with homemade garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Can't wait to make it again!

A little sweet. Next time I will buy dry Marsala wine to see how that turns out.

Absolutely wonderful!! I had to modify this for health reasons, but it still turned out great. I used chicken tenderloins. For the sauce, I used olive oil and fat free butter spray. I didn't have any Marsala wine or cooking sherry on hand, so I just used some sweet table wine. The combination of the mushrooms, wine, olive oil and butter spray was such a delicious combination. When my husband tasted it, his eyes opened wide and said how good it was. I made enough for left overs for tomorrow night, but my husband said I could make for he next three nights. He really liked it. It took very little time to make, so I'll be making this often.

This is a very good recipe, but with some of the changes suggested here, it is GREAT! I sauteed the chicken and removed it from the pan. Added mushrooms, sauteed until slightly soft. Added 3/4 c. marsala (no sherry). Then 1 c. chicken broth with 2 tsp. cornstarch, then 2 tbsp. half-n-half (I used fat free). Added the chicken back and let everything cook together and the sauce thicken. AMAZING! Only change I would make next time is to use 1 c. marsala and 3/4 c. broth, to get an even stronger marsala taste.

I used a little bit less wine and about one cup of chicken broth, as well as a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the mixture more quickly.  I also used Portobello mushrooms for a richer flavour.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T, and it was delicious.  Have made this before, and will likely make it again.  Goes well with Farfalle pasta (I find) and a side of veggies.  See picture. :)

This was the BEST! I made it for a small dinner party,  and was so nervous since I was trying a new recipe, but they RAVED about it! My husband said it was the best chicken he had ever had... I did double the sauce, and since I made a large batch, I put the chicken in a casserole in the oven on 250° and poured the sauce and mushrooms over it rather than completing it in the skillet. I will be making this again!

Easy and delicious.  I have made it twice and the second time i added the remaining flour mixture to the pan and therefore had more of a sauce.  I also cooked chicken on high heat at first to brown it more- much better.  We like it served with mashed potatoes w/ a little oregano in them.  Definitely a keeper!!

I thought this was mediocre. Flavors didnt get any better as they gelled overnight. I've had much better marsala.

This dish was excellent! I did make some changes, though. I used thinly sliced chicken breasts & removed them from the pan after browning in order to make the sauce. I used Holland House marsala & sherry from the supermarket, which worked out perfect because I don't like a super-sweet marsala(just remember that these contain salt, so don't add alot of extra salt if you use these). I also added 1TBSP cornstarch mixed w/1TBSP water to thicken. I added chicken back in at end and simmered for several minutes. Also, I doubled the recipe & still could have used more sauce for the two of us(over pasta). Delicious!!

This was easy, delicious, and perfect for a romantic dinner.  I used butter flavored cooking spray in place of the butter, and added more mushrooms and some finely chopped garlic.  It turned out great!  thank you!  I'll make this again and again and next time I think I'll add even more garlic.

YUM. I've recently started cooking, but I've been eating my entire life. This was great. Very easy to make and so good to eat, even when reheated. I used to work at the Olive Garden restaurant (as a server) and this is the closest to that flavor that I've found. I only used 1/4 the butter and oil. I added more mushrooms, too.

Cut the chicken in pieces, use half the oil and butter, brown the chicken pieces first, then the mushrooms, double the mushrooms, thicken the sauce before serving and it's great.

Wow! This was superb! I made this in less than 30 minutes after work and it tasted like it took hours. I read many of the reviews and took some hints from each. I did not have Sherry so I substituted Pinot Grigio. I used about 3 cups of mushrooms that I had on hand before they went bad and it was perfect.  Added a Tablespoon of minced garlic and about 3 Tablespoons of Corn Starch and some said to add cream but I didn't have any so .... I used a couple of splashes of Sugar Free Italian Sweet Cream Cofeemate and that made it awesome! Not too sweet, not too bold. This is a keeper! Thanks!

I'm giving it a 3 just because my husband liked it, however I did not.  It could be several things: I bought Marsala wine as suggested by others, but my store only had one brand. Maybe it wasn't a great one.  I didn't care for the "slime" coating the flour gives.  It was essentially tasteless to me.  I think overall it was lacking something.  Honestly I have never had Marsala chicken, so maybe it's just me and I don't care for it.

Yum! This recipe is easy and quick!  I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe, ingredient-wise. My husband loved it too-- I made it with chicken tenderloins from Costco, so the pieces were a bit smaller and I didn't pound them. I liked that the thickening comes from the flour on the chicken vs. making a roux and then adding the sherry/marsala then adding the chicken. Definitely a keeper!

9/2016 - as tastes have changed a bit, I remade this and found that I didn't like as much with so much Marsala. I tweaked the amount of marsala to 1/4c. and subbed 1 C. Chicken Broth. No sherry.  Also added some garlic salt to the sauce.

I followed this recipe except I doubled the mushrooms, marsala and sherry.  It was awesome!!!  I also followed the suggestion of using a plastic bag to coat the chicken; it made this step simple with no mess to clean up!  Not only is this delicious, but it was also simple with very little mess...very easy to pull off on a weeknight.

So good, but too sweet. 
1. Flour, salt, pepper (both cayenne and black), oregano, and salt. Coat the chicken and then cook in butter and oil.
2. Remove chicken and put aside. Cook the mushrooms in the same pan until soft and brown. (next time I'm going to remove after this step, the mushrooms soaked up all of the wine and they tasted like alcohol)
3. Make the sauce. I doubled the sauce and I also added whipping cream, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder.
4. Add chicken and mushrooms back into the sauce and cook for 10 minutes covered or until your sauce thickens to your liking. 

I served over angel hair pasta and topped with parmesan cheese.  

I've been told adding a capful of vinegar will cut down on the sweetness. Any other suggestions would be great.

Very tasty. Chicken needed more salt and a tad bit of garlic powder. I will make this again but will cook the mushrooms longer and double the sauce. For as easy as it is to make it is really a nice dish>

My friend and I actually stumbled on the recipe by accident. We thought we were making chicken MASALA (the indian dish), not marsala, the italian dish. I must say, it was the best mistake we ever made. This dish turned out AMAZING. We followed the instructions exactly, except for 2 things: First, instead of pounding down the chicken breasts, we cut the chicken into about 1 inch cubes so they're bite-sized and easier to cook. Must double the amount of flour coating to accommodate for higher surface area of chicken pieces. Second, we poured this over pasta shells in the pan and mixed it all together. The pasta soaks up all the wonderful sauce in this recipe and it's AMAZING. I'd recommend serving this dish immediately before the oil and the rest of the sauce separates, so it doesn't feel too greasy when you eat it. This is just my absolute favourite recipe!

Well, I started out following this recipe but ended up back at Emeril Lagasse's recipe. Emeril's recipe is 3/4 cup Marsala and 1 cup chicken broth, no sherry.  3 cups mushrooms mixed like cremini, oyster, shiitake

Bam! which it always is. 1 cup mushrooms?  I think not and not just one kind of mushroom. I also like my chicken stock and cream in mine.  I tried to follow this, but no.  But  I did give it a 4 for easy to follow.

I just made this for boyfriend and his family and they said it was fantastic. the only change I made was I added more seasoning and added parsley. 

I served it with broccoli and mashed potatoes, used the same herbs in the taters as i did on the chicken. and used a little chicken stock in the potatoes to lighten and moisten them. they had very good complimentary flavors for eachother.

the chicken was moist and tender and everyone raved about them.

I didn't have a lid big enough so i covered the pan loosely in heavy duty foil and it did the trick.

oh yeah and a trick for the mushrooms, you know that egg slicer that only has 1 use in your kitchen, it slices mushrooms fabulously!!!

This was fabulous, better than any I've tasted in restaurants.  I was cooking for 3 adults who love Marsala and lots of mushrooms, so I used an entire 16 oz carton of mushrooms. I used 3/4 cup of wine and 1/3 cup chicken broth instead of sherry. I did not pound the chicken, I used very thin skinless boneless chicken tenderloins and cut into bite size pieces. I put flour and seasonings in a 2 quart zip-lock and just rinsed the chicken and threw it in the bag wet, at least 4 pieces at a time and shook, they coated well, (I don't have the patience to stand there and do 1 piece at a time lol), I used tongs to pull them out, now this I did one at a time, and laid them in the hot oil and butter, turning once and removing to a plate once they were golden brown. In the same pan I added more butter and sauteed the mushrooms, added a 1 cup diced onion and 1 tsp jarred minced garlic. Once the onion was soft and mushrooms were well done I added the chicken broth, wine and a splash of lemon juice, (maybe a 1/4c). Then I placed the browned chicken pieces back in the pan and simmered stirring occasionally. I cooked angel hair pasta and tossed it with butter basil and oregano and sea salt to serve the Marsala over. I also added a mixture of 3 tbs of cornstarch and water to thicken it a little more at the end. My daughter in law raved and said it was my best meal ever, I am not sure I agree with that but she is a picky eater and so coming from her....well WOW, is all I ca say! Try this one!!!

I've never had chicken marsala before but heard from a few people that it is a great tasting dish. So I decided to try it. Had most of the ingredients on hand, and it was quick and easy. I followed some of the suggestions that were made; such as adding garlic and onions to the dish and I thought that it made a great addition. Great tasty dish.

Oh my goodness, this was INCREDIBLE!  If you're looking for a super impressive yet super fast and easy chicken recipe, you just found it.  The whole time we were eating it my husband and I kept looking at each other saying "Wow, this is REALLY good!".  The original recipe is an excellent base, but it's definitely worth it to read through the other reviews to see what people have done to doctor it up.  We sauteed minced garlic and sliced onions in the oil before browning the chicken and it was really fabulous just with that.  Other people suggest adding cream, though we found the sauce was plenty rich without it.  The recipe makes enough sauce for the chicken, but if you're planning on serving this over pasta you might want to double it (the sauce is so good, you won't complain!).  This is definitely a recipe you'll want to come back to-stick in in your recipe box!

Easy adjustment to feed one or two - I rinse one chicken breast, then cut it into cubes/chunks (removing any fat,) then dip it in the flour mixed with just a touch of oregano, salt and pepper, and a touch of dried basil.  I saute the chicken in the pan all by itself in a tsp of oil, then remove to a paper towel when done.  I then melt a tablespoon of butter and another of oil and put the mushrooms as well as sliced onions in the pan.  When those are cooked down, I add the chicken back in along with the marsala and sherry (in a 2 to 1 ratio) - regular wines, not cooking wines.  Let simmer for a few minutes for all the flavors to meld, then serve with angelhair or your favorite pasta plus a nice green salad on the side.  Excellent meal for one or two using only one chicken breast.

I thought this was a great recipe.  Easy to do and delicious.  The only thing I would recommend is adding more mushrooms and I also added chopped onion.  I also used 3/4C of marsala wine instead of cooking sherry.

Absolutely the best marsala chicken I have ever eaten. I did modify the recipe a little. After browning the chicken, I sauted portabella mushrooms with a little fresh garlic. Then added the wine, some half and half and let that reduce. I then added the chicken and a little chicken stock. Let that simmer about 10 minutes. Then added some corn starch dissolved in a little cold water. I let that thicken and served it over linguine. JACKPOT.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!! I LOVE Chicken Marsala and order it ever chance I get when I dine out and for whatever reason I thought it was something I couldn't make at home. One day I was browsing on here for chicken recipes and saw this one and was surprised at how simple the recipe was! I made it twice so far and both times were a hit! I made it just like the recipe except I used garlic powder in the flour and on the chicken and I put minced garlic in the pan with the butter and olive oil. I made it with mashed potatos both times. Try this recipe you will love it!

This was a great recipe after reading the advice of reviewers and doing some tweaking of my own.  First of all, I used half the amount of butter and oil to make it healthier.  I browned both sides of the chicken in a regular (not non-stick) pan, then removed the chicken from the pan.  Then I deglazed the pan with TWICE the amount of sherry and marsala called for, scraping the browned bits off the pan into the wine.  I added two cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. salt and a mixture of 2 Tbsp. corn starch with 2 Tbsp. water to the wine.  Then I added THREE CUPS mushrooms and the chicken back into the pan, covered and cooked for 10 minutes.  It turned out restaurant-quality.  My husband asked where the smoked cheese was, like they do at Olive Garden!  I served it over angel hair pasta and a salad on the side.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is a winner! I've tried to make chicken marsala before to no avail, and this was easy. I followed some advice and didn't add sherry, but I didn't add flour to the wine and it was rather thin. I just used plain old white mushrooms, grocery store-purchased Marsala and threw in a pinch of sugar with the wine because I like my marsala sweet. This is a new favorite!

Excellent!  I made this ahead for a party. I didn't change the ingredients but sliced chicken breasts is smaller sized strips, cooked as directed, removed from pan, skipped mushrooms & made marsala sauce.  I then froze the chicken & marsala sauce separately.  Day before party, defrost. Day of party, saute mushrooms, add marsala sauce & pour over chicken in a crockpot to heat.  Friends thought I had slave all day & it was great as a buffet item.

Just as a rule of  thumb...use a good variety of "drinking" sherry instead of "cooking" sherry, whenever sherry is called for....the difference is remarkable.you'll never view recipes calling for sherry the same way!

I wanted to MAKE AHEAD so that I could enjoy my dinner party. I browned chicken in butter and olive oil (I halved it to save on fat). Then I removed the chicken and made the sauce (I doubled the sauce and could have tripled it!) w/mushrooms, garlic, and vadalia (sp?) onion. In a casserole dish, I topped chicken with sauce and then refrigerated overnight.  I warmed it, covered, at 350 for about 45 min. Tasted delicious and no need to thicken b/c sauce seemed to thicken overnight. Tasted like I had just made it that night but I was able to enjoy my party! One other change I made: Instead of pounding chicken, I sliced them in half horizontally to yield to thin pieces.

Love this recipe! I only make a couple of modifications; I add a lot more mushrooms, cut back a little on the butter/olive oil (8 tblspns isn't necessary if you're using a good non-stick pan), and I season my flour a little more heavily than the recipe calls for (more salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika). To help the breading stay on the chicken, be sure to let the chicken breasts sit in the flour mixture for about 30 minutes in the fridge, then shake off the excess and fry them initially at a higher temp to brown before turning the heat down to simmer. We love the sauce light and clear just as written (although doubled for us!) - adding cream just wouldn't be the same marsala we love. :-) I serve this over whole grain angel hair and finely sliced green onions on top. Thanks so much for this SUPER easy and much-loved recipe that's definitely on our rotation!

I'm loving this recipe. I agree with the others that the sauce needs to be doubled. More sauce is needed. I did add the heavy cream - and used dry marsala wine. I did add 1/4 tsp Emeril's Essence in place of the 1/4 oregeno that I would have added to double the recipe. I doubled everthing but the number of chicken breasts and it worked perfectly.I have picky eaters and neither of the two added any spice to theirs. They liked the dish, but didn't want it to be a weekly rotation. Hope that helps.

This is my new favorite recipe, I make it EVERY week!!! The only changes I make are adding a couple cloves of garlic and using all marsala and no sherry. I too double the sauce because I can't get enough. I'll add in a little flour and spices to the sauce after I take the chicken out and let it simmer for a bit and then poor on top of the chicken and mushrooms. I have searched for a good chicken marsala reicpe, thanks!!!

I've been making this for 4 years now and I'm finally reviewing it.  Great recipe.  I make double the amount of sauce and serve it over pasta, use all marsala (no sherry) and add a couple crushed/minced gloves of garlic before adding the wine.

This recipe was GREAT! Tasted just like an Italian restaurant entree! I had to double the recipe for a family party, so after browning the chicken, I transferred them to a large baking dish. Then I cooked the mushrooms and added the rest of the "sauce mixture" to the frying pan and let simmer for a little while. I also added some chicken broth and heavy cream as I read others did. I poured this over the chicken breasts and baked in a 350 degree oven for approx. 40 minutes. Raves from everyone~even the children! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is so easy. Every time I would make it for a gathering it was a huge success. I would add extra baby Portabella mushrooms and about an extra 1/4 cup of butter. This recipe is one of the best ones I have ever made from this website. You will love it!

Another winner!  Added an additional cup of fresh sliced mushrooms, substituted 1 cup Marsala for Marsala + Sherry and added 2 small cloves crushed garlic to butter/oil mix to brown chicken in. I used fresh oregano instead of dried. Fantastic!!!  Served it with a side of Angel Hair tossed with EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) more fresh chopped oregano and chopped fresh parsley. This was awsome with a Chilean Carmenere.  The earthiness of the chicken and wine went very well together.  I will use this for a fast company dinner.

This recipe is awesome! I add chopped bacon & shallots and also use all marsala wine so it's a bit sweeter but "as is" this the best recipe of it's kind.

Didn't like this at all. Followed the recipe exactly. I can't figure out why it is rated so high by other reviewers. Too much butter and olive oil. Flavor was lost in it. Maybe a reduction of the sauce would have concentrated the flavors so the wines would have come through. Chicken was very tender but that's all it had going for it. Will never make this one again.

Excellent recipe - at first I was worried the sauce would be too thin but I left cover off the pan and it reduced quite nicely. I did add salt to the sauce but beware - flavor becomes much more concentrated as it reduces. I coated the chicken quite well with flour so that a lot of it went into the pan as well. I did remove the breasts after browning, then added mushrooms (doubled the mushrooms) and 1 clove crushed garlic to the pan. Sauteed briefly then added the wine (I used Marsala only) and then returned the chicken to the pan and reduced the sauce. Served it with angel hair that had basil, garlic olive oil in it and spinach that I wilted in garlic lemon and olive oil. Was a great and easy meal!

This was definitely a great recipe, but I did make a few changes. For the flour mixture, I doubled the oregano and also added about 1/2 tsp dried basil. I reduced the olive oil and butter to 3 tbsp each. Before I added the chicken to the skillet, I added about 1 tsp minced garlic to sautee it with. I also added extra mushrooms. I didn't have the sherry, so I added a little extra marsala and just about 1/3 cup chicken broth. Chicken turned out really tender and delicious!

This is so delicious and EASY. Everyone I serve it to loves it with angel hair pasta.  My suggestion is to make the chicken and sauce ahead and then reheat before serving. It makes it so much more flavorful!

I made this for a pre-christmas dinner and it was fantastic. Of course I tweeked it a bit, adding a few more ingredients as recommended in many of the other reviews.  I served it with bow-tie pasta seasoned with fresh basil, parsley, garlic and olive oil and a stir-fried vegetable medley of yellow squash, zuccini, julian carrots and baby green beans, lightly seasoned with garlic and basil. My hat's off to Lisa for a real winner!

This is just *excellent*!! My Boyfriend who did not like wine got addicted to this! I double the liquids (marsala and sherry) for more sauce, the original quantity will leave any "sauce type" guest on their appetite. I also sprinkle oregano in the pan since it doesn't stick to the chicken very well. Délicieux!

This tastes just like the entree ordered at a local restaurant.  I don't have to order it anymore at $13.  Easy, inexpensive and definitely a keeper.  My husband is not fond of mushrooms, but ate every bit.  I altered the recipe as a result of reading the reviews.  Half the oil and butter, more mushrooms.  Took less than 1/2 hour from start to finish.  Thanks Lisa, the best wishes for a happy holiday to you and your family.

YUK..VERY BLAH.  My fiance LOVES Chicken Marsala and always orders this out and he too said this lacked flavor.  I even used an expensive wine and 2 types of mushrooms.  Keep the wine (in a glass) and toss this recipe.

Loved it.  Quick, easy, and delicious - what else can you say?  A keeper.  The ONLY thing I would change is adding a bit more of the liquids to yield more for pasta.

I added a bit of flour to the the juices at the end to make a thicker sauce for the chicken.  Also, I would use less oil or butter next time.

Very easy and fast, but it was tasteless. The chicken was tender and melted in your mouth. The sauce left much to be desired.

Sounded good to start, but not a soul in the household cared for it. The best chicken was what i had left and didnt put in the pan with the marsala and wine. We ate those instead.

Excellent! We dumped in the leftover breading flour before adding the wine to make it thicker.  Cooking wines worked fine for us.  Great dinner.

Pretty good marsala recipe. As everyone else suggested, I browned the chicken and removed it and then sautéed 2 cups of mushrooms with one medium shallot chopped. Added 1 cup marsala (no sherry) and deglazed the pan for 3 minutes and then added a splash of heavy cream and chicken broth and simmered for a few minutes before adding the chicken back in, simmered for 7 min, plated the chicken and allowed sauce to thicken for another minute.  I served the extra sauce with angel hair pasta. The dish definitely needed more salt but luckily I had truffle salt to add to the top of the chicken and pasta which made it delish! 
Edit: made this again exactly the same way as I reviewed prior, only I added salt and pepper to the sauce before returning the chicken to the pan. DELISH!

Unfortunately, mine came out  horrible, I assume it is because I used dry Marsala wine, instead of sweet Marsala wine, since I followed the receipe exactly.

This Chicken Marsala recipe is definately a 5 star!  This dish is simple to make and really tasty.  I used 3/4 cup of marsala wine in place of the cooking sherry.  When completely cooked, I thickened the sause with a small amount of flour, and topped the dish with steamed asparagus....yum!

This was a great recipe! I like a cream sauce so I took the advice of a previous review and added some half and half, also used fresh oregano in sauce instead of dried and omitted the cooking sherry. This was AMAZING!

This recipe is a 5-star as is, but being the adventurer that I am, I made adjustments that suited my family's tastes.  I use chicken tenders--no pounding, but I remove the ligament.  Flour and Italian Seasoning, salt & pepper in a plastic bag to make both prep and cleanup easier.  When the chicken was lightly browned, I removed it to a dish and added 1 heaping Tbl minced garlic to the pan, gave it a quick 30-sec saute, then added 1 cup of chicken broth, then the sherry and Marsala wine.  I've made it both with and without mushrooms.  Either way, it has a restaurant-quality flavor and it's a hit with family and friends. Thanks for sharing this one!

I went about this a little differently.  I began by sautéing my mushrooms and removing them from the pan.  I then cooked the chicken in the same pan and removed it to a warm oven and proceeded with the sauce.  I added a little corn starch/water slurry to thicken the sauce and added a pat of butter.  I added the chicken and mushrooms back to the pan, coating them with sauce and served.  Very good!

Can't believe I've been making this since 2003 and I've never reviewed it! Not that another review is needed, but my family really likes this recipe. I add more mushrooms and HEAVILY season the flour mix and the chicken(we prefer more seasoned foods, what can I say?) Like other reviewers, I finish mine off with a bit of heavy cream and a cornstarch/cold water slurry to thicken up the sauce a bit. Served on a bed of fettucine and any veggie you choose, this recipe is a definite keeper!

One of my favorites!  I use chicken tenderloins to cut down on time (and I think they are easier to handle when flouring and getting them to fit in the pan).  I always add extra mushrooms because I love them.  The recipe is quick and easy.  I pair this chicken with roasted potatoes and spinach for a delicious weeknight meal.

I used canned mushrooms, drained them and also put in some chopped onion done in a food processor.  Also, DO NOT use, as others have pointed out, "cooking wine" as it is way too salty.  I used more Marsala wine as told in Culinary school, and it made a big difference.  I also used boneless chicken breasts and cut them in half myself, then pounded them with a meat mallet.  Season the chicken breasts too, gave a nice flavor, with salt, pepper, garlic salt and onion salt combined.  A very easy and good recipie.

This was a good recipe. Because of all the different reviews I was a little nervous. I did follow some advice and added garlic, onions, and heavy cream. I'm glad I did because the sauce was a little thin so the cream helped at least make it creamy. I did cook the chicken first, took it out, made the sauce, then put it back in the sauce. My husband loved it, my 18 month old daughter even loved it. We enjoyed it with Parmesan rice and broccoli. I would definitely make it again! My very first time making chicken marsala!

Quick and Delicious
Poured dry ingredients in a gallon Ziploc, added chicken tenders (instead of full breasts), tossed bag to coat chicken and pounded the tenders to even thickness.  Cooking was simple, deglazed pan for sauce and served with a side of angel hair.  Will definitely make this again.

This was amazing.  I don't really consider myself a "cook" but I was able to produce a restaurant quality meal.  I took others advise - substituted the sherry with more Marsala, doubled the sauce and added some chicken broth and heavy cream to make the sauce even richer.  Served over fettuccine, it was delicious!  Highly recommend!

Saute the mushrooms first until the water comes off and then set aside.  Then brown the chicken, poured on the wine and add the mushrooms back in. Cook down the wine. Serve with egg noodles and green veggie.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this.  Thanks!

I was out of cream for my standard recipe (Easy Chicken Marsala by sal on this site) and decided this might do okay.  More than okay, this was wonderful and I'll make it again.  I used chicken tenderloins/cutlets that I had on hand.

Made this tonight and it is delicious!  I love this flavor and can't believe I've waited so long to try this recipe. Very easy.  I did modify and use 3/4 marsala wine, no sherry, and did as the top reviewer suggested to remove chicken then make the sauce with cream. Excellent. Thanks Lisa!

This isnt marsala.  Whether this is even food is debatable.  One cup of mushrooms?  This pathetic amount of sauce?  Its awful.

This is scrumptious!!  I have made this several times now and finally feel like I've mastered it!!  First of all, I double the mushrooms and use the baby bellas.  I cook the mushrooms on the side in 1tsp. of garlic. Then in a separate pan I add 2tsp. of minced garlic and a handful of white onion to the oil/butter while cooking the chicken. (I also pound the chicken to 1/4 inch thick before hand.)  I cook the chicken on med. for about 4 minutes per side and then set the chicken aside.  Finally, I add the wines while wisking the sauce.  I like it thick so I add 2TBSP. of the flour mixture and whisk.... sometimes I even add 1TBSP. of cornstartch/water.  Once I whisk to desired consistency I add the mushrooms and chicken, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes.  DELISH.  This is so yummy served with the day before mashed potatoes from this site (made a couple of hours before and kept warm in the crock pot) and whatever veggie you have on hand.  My husband, 12 yr. old and 1 yr. old LOVE this dish!!!   You won't be sorry you tried this one:)

I have used this recipe for a number of years now.I use only 4 tablespoons of fat, either all olive oil or 2 of olive oil and 2 of butter and  I use only Marsala wine, 1 cup and add  8 oz sliced mushrooms. Will try with a little haf and half added, have not tried that before. I usually add a little chicken stock till it is the consistancy that I like to add over pasta.

Served this to my family and they really enjoyed it - my mom said "Good enough to serve to company."  My changes were 1) brown the mushrooms in butter separately, to get better color and flavor, 2) Cook the chicken and remove prior to adding the wine and sherry, and 3) Add the mushrooms back into the reduced wine/sherry.  All ingredients/amounts the same.  Thanks for sharing!

Tweaked this a little because it's 1st time I made chicken marsala.  Used basil from my garden (no oregano), no flour, no oil -only butter & fresh garlic and onions, small amount of chicken stock, Marsala wine, dry sherry & mushrooms. Tried to make a little more calorie conscious due to diet.  It was very tasty & will definitely make again but probably with a pasta rather than a vegetable for a side dish.

I usually use a recipe from America's Test Kitchen for Chicken Marsala, but it is complicated and time consuming so I thought I'd give this a try.  While it was good, it didn't have the depth of flavor of my usual recipe.  This is good for the family, but for guests I'll stick with ATK.  Thanks for the recipe!

Taste was excellent, but next time, I would also double the sauce ingredients and cook the mushrooms longer, I also added yellow onions in to this and sauteed them with the musrooms.

Chicken Marsala is one of those dishes where you can really mix it up and do different things, add different ingredients, and it can still come out great.
This was my first time making it, so I experimented.
I added garlic powder to the flour mixture, and diced onions in with the mushrooms. I wanted the sauce to get creamy and thick, so I substituted the sherry with about a cup of chicken stock, and I also added some heavy cream to give it an added creamy look and taste. Also, I forgot to add the olive oil in with the butter, and it didn't seem to make a difference. I put it over the linguini, and it was really good. Word of advice, be generous with the spices, you can even add extra at the end.
Good luck!

Amazing, made this for an anniversary dinner and it turned out fab. Pounding out the chicken was the key, when it was cooked it was super tender and sucked up all the juices. Better than any I've had at restaurants.

INCREDIBLE!!!  I signed up for this site just to rate this recipe, it was truly that good.  As others have mentioned, fry the chicken, remove it, then add the mushrooms, wine, and a dash or two of flour for thickening.  MAKE SURE you use GOOD (cooking) wine, I used the Holland brand bought from Kroger and it was incredible.  This recipe was truly a 5-star experience.

Wow - it really did come out like fine-dining chicken marsala's I've had in restaurants before - everyone totally RAVED. I used TONS of portabello mushrooms sliced and doubled the sauce recipe like others - also added heavy whipping cream and a a bit of cornstarch at the very end to thicken and then reduced. YUM-EEEEE.

So good and super easy to make. I thought I had purchased a bag of frozen chicken breasts and it turned out they were thighs - I used this recipe and it worked just fine. I used a nonstick skillet and cut down on the fats by half.

I made this for 28 people and it was a great success.  I browned 14 breast and put in a chafing pan covered with foil.  Then I made the sauce and mushrooms in the pans(4x the recipe).  Added to the chicken and kept on low in oven until bringing it out to the chafing dish.  Delicious and easy!!!

I combined this with Tyler Florence's version, so I fried the chicken in the butter first and then removed it to warm in the oven while I cooked the mushrooms in the mixture provided here.  I then added the chicken to the mixture and finished cooking.  I was cooking for 12 so I moved them all into a large pyrex and poured the marsala mixture over them!  It was perfect!  The separation of the chicken cooking and the mushrooms made it easier to make it for a large dinner party.

This is totally amazing. I fried the chicken in Parkay Fat Free Butter spray. I used cooking wine. I doubled the sauce,added a pinch of ginger,a little thyme,salt,3/4 tsp.of onion powder and 3/4 tsp. of garlic powder. This made a fat free main course and the wild rice and asparagus I made with it was also fat free. We had an amazing fat free dinner loaded with exquisite taste. thanks for sharing. This is a keeper. Making it again tonight.

I made this recipe as is and although the flavor was good - I think I will need to tweak it a little to our taste.  It didn't make much sauce at all - barely enough for a drizzle over the chicken.  I will try it again, but, double the sauce and probably dilute with a little chicken broth.  The marsala was just a little sweet for our taste.

Ok, perhaps I am not a huge fan of Chicken Marsala, I felt it was kind of blah, and very greasy.

Yummy. I made a few modifications. I added 1/4 cup more marsala, 1/3 cup chicken broth, 2 cups of mushrooms. 2 T butter and 2 T olive oil. Sauteed the chicken, took it out of the pan and sauteed shrooms with garlic. Added onion powder and parsely. Took the chicken out after the last step and reduced the gravy with a little Wondra flour stirred in.

Great recipe. I didn't use any sherry, just added more marsala. I thickened it slightly with cornstarch and water, and I added a few drops of gravy master because the sauce was so light. It tasted great and my whole family loved it.

Made this dish slicing two very large chicken breasts in half long ways to make four good size pieces of chicken.  I added the garlic slices as mentioned in another review and doubled the wine, butter and mushrooms.  I also thickened with some corn starch.  This was easily one of best chicken dishes I have made or had.  This one is a keeper!!

thought it was wonderful as is.  just be wary of letting your sauce cook too long as it will begin to caramelize.

This recipe is easy and taste absolutely amazing. I was nervious to cook this dinner because I have had good and bad experiences trying this dish when dining out and it was my boyfriend's first time trying chicken marsala. This was by far the best meal we have ever had at home! I followed the recipe pretty dead on except I added extra mushrooms and shallots, red onion, and chopped garlic to the olive oil. My boyfriend preparred brussel sprouts and shredded carrots; cooked in a chicken stock and added extra flavor with bacon. It was a perfect match to the sweet marsala. Also I made one of my favorite salads that go great with this dish. Arugula lettuce, beets, and feta cheese with basalmic vinigar dressing.  Perfect sweet and salty pairing! :) I definelty recommend this recipe if I can cook it you can too!

This was incrediably delicious.  I made this for dinner last night and just had the leftovers for lunch and words can't express how much I like this dish.  I had unexected guests last night and only had thawed 3 breasts so I cut them into 1 inch cubes and tossed them in a zip lock with the flour and seasonings.  I added extra mushrooms because I love them.   Served with angel hair pasta, crusty bread and a salad I easily fed 5 adults.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Lisa.  It is definately a 5 star in my book!

Very good, still needed some more punch to the sauce to get a 5 star rating.  I would definitely adjust the seasoning and look for other ideas if you want more flavor.  Hubby and kids loved it.  I am admittedly very picky about my Chicken Marsala.

Yummy! Thank you Lisa. I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and doubled the sauce. The next time I make this, I will remove the chicken from the pan and allow the sauce to thicken into a syrupy sauce. I cheated and added some corn starch to thicken the sauce, which it did, but it would have been better to allow the sauce to thicken on it's own.

This was pretty good.  Definitely easy to make, and fairly quick.  I only used 2 chicken breasts, but made the full amount of sauce - which worked out well.

This was amazing!  I only used the marsala wine, didn't have sherry and instead of pounding the chicken I just sliced it in half to make it thinner.  I also placed dry ingred. in a large ziplock bag and shook.  Fast and tasty!

This dish is sensational!  It's easy enough for a beginner yet at the same time a classic and easily customizable dish for the more experienced cook.  Chicken Marsala is definitely a dish one will want to keep in their repertoire and this recipe makes it quick and simple.    I doubled the marsala wine in lieu of using the sherry.  After the chicken was fully cooked (10 minutes), I removed it from the pan and set it aside in a covered dish.  I added more marsala wine, heavy cream, a little chicken stock and a sprinkle of flour to the pan and simmered it for another five minutes.  The end result was a lovely marsala sauce to toss my pasta with.  I filled each dish with the pasta then topped it with the chicken.  It came out better than The Olive Garden's!

Me & my husband LOVE italian food! It makes us remember our time we spent in Italy.  This dish was amazing!  I, like everyone else, made a few adjustments myself.  If you want enough sauce to pour over your pasta, you really need to do the following:  1. Add a slurry mix. I mixed about 3-4 Tbsp of cornstarch with about 3/4 cup of cream or thick milk.  This adds a creaminess to the sauce as well as thickens it.  Otherwise the sauce is more soupy.  2. Add chicken broth.  This adds flavor as well as makes a larger amount of sauce.  Add both the slurry and broth little by little until you reach the thickness you prefer.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce and cut the chicken breasts into chunks. I put the flour and seasoning in a ziplock back to coat the chicken chunks.  Since the sauce was thinner than I prefer, I sprinkled by hand a little bit of flour on top to thicken.  This recipe is definitely worth preparing again, but I would make the following changes:  reduce the amount of butter and olive oil, use all Marsala wine - no sherry.  I would also add fresh garlic and some sour cream for extra creaminess.

I love chicken marsala, but I was sad when I lost the recipe that I loved. I searched this website & found this well-rated recipe. I made it for my boyfriend and I for dinner, and it was NOT GOOD. He commented on how it had no flavor & was watery. Thank god I found my original favorite chicken marsala recipe days later. I made that version & my loved it. I will have to post it on here because I DO NOT recommend this one.

This really is a wonderful, restaurant quality dish! Like others, I doubled both the mushrooms and the sauce. When browning the chicken, I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic. Once browned, I removed the chicken from the pan and sauteed the mushrooms, along with about 1/2 cup chopped onion, for about 5 minutes. I then returned the chicken to the pan and added the remaining ingredients. After simmering for 10 min, I added a splash of half and half and about 2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up.  Of the many recipes I have tried from this site, this is definitely my new favorite!  *UPDATE- I made this once again but only had cooking marsala. It was terrible! Make sure you make the extra trip to the liquor store if you don't have the real stuff!

This recipe is delicious! I have to only give it 4 stars though, because I also made a few slight modifications-I had printed this one out, as well as Tyler Florence's version of chicken marsala, and kind of mixed and matched to fit what I had at home.  Instead of the Sherry wine, I used just Marsala and Chicken Stock.  I wasn't sure whether sweet or dry marsala wine was best, so I asked the guy at the wine store, and he handed me a bottle of Opici Marsala wine (I live in NJ) and said that that would be fine.  It's about $6.00. 
I melted the butter in the olive oil and dredged the cutlets in flour/salt/pepper and a little garlic powder.  I cooked the chicken until browned and removed them from the pan.  I was a little nervous because it had looked as though the butter had turned brown in the pan and I was afraid it was burnt.  I had no choice but to add the mushrooms into the browned butter and cook them down a bit.  I then added back the chicken breasts.  I doubled the wine and chicken broth, to 1 cup each, and allowed it to boil for a little bit, about 2-3 minutes, and then placed the lid on to simmer the breasts in the sauce.  

I served it over linguine, and the 5 of us devoured the entire thing! My grandparents licked their plates clean, and demanded to keep the wine there so I would have to come back and make it again soon. I took it that this recipe is a keeper.  It is delicious! And surprisingly very easy for something so elegant!  The changes I made are not really de

This recipe is incredible!  I have been making it for the past few years now, and my friends all know it as "Amanda's Chicken Marsala" (Sorry Lisa) ;) 

I add quite a bit more marsala wine than the recipe calls for, and I also add garlic to the butter/oil when browning the chicken pieces.  

To thicken the sauce, I mix some of the remaining flour mixture.

Amazing flavor!

I made this tonight. I used a plain red cooking wine instead of marsala. But it was still delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful!  We just finished eating some leftovers for lunch and it was so good again.  I made the following changes and/or additions:  I added some more seasoning to the flour mix, some italian seasoning mix and some seasoned salt.  I browned the chicken on both sides until it was done and then removed the chicken from the pan.  I added some garlic (2 cloves) and onions (1/2 large diced) with the mushrooms (I increased to three cups since we love mushrooms).  Sauteed all of that until the mushrooms and onions were soft.  Then I added my wine, I omitted the sherry since I didn't have any.  I then added 1 c. of chicken broth and 1 c. of half and half.  Brought it all to a boil and added some cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  Then I poured it all over my chicken in a serving dish and served it with angel hair pasta and some asparagus.  We also passed around a bowl of freshly grated parmesean and added generous amounts to our plates.  Absolutely delicious!!!  This recipe will become a staple in our household for sure!

Very easy to make, and tasted great! We're not even huge mushroom fans. Definitely think this would be a nice meal to make for company because it tastes like you spent awhile cooking it!

This is excellent, and very easy.  Elegant enough to make when you have company over.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect.  I will definately be making this one again.

Like this recipe needed anymore reviews!  Made this today and the family loved it.  Doubled the sauce and mushrooms but next time I will add more mushrooms.  Served it over a box of whole wheat penne and it was just perfect.  I added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit for the pasta as some reviews suggested.  Loved the recipe but would like to make it a little healthier for the kids and cut down the butter/oil.

Absolutely wonderful. I did as others suggested, removed the chicken after cooking and added ff half & half w/ chicken broth to make the sauce creamier, had to add a little flour to thicken. Served over angel hair. The whole family loved it, will definitely be making on a regular basis. PS..The Marsala wine that you find w/ the other cooking wines was just fine in this, it was less than $2.

My husband and two of my children loved this recipe and the chicken was extremely tender.  My other son and I thought it lacked flavor.  I may try to add more spice to the flour coating next time.

Marsala is one of my boyfriend's favorites and the reviews of this recipe persueded me to try it ... Like others have suggested, I nearly tripled the amount of sauce (it was still barely enough for 2 of us) ...added about a 1/4 cup of fat free half/half at the end to give it a creamy texture and also added a little cornstarch/water slurry to thicken it slightly ... this recipe was fantastic and easy ... I WILL be making it again very soon ... it's now a staple around here ... thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

Usually I don't like writing review, but I just have to say I found this website by mistake while searching for chicken marsala recipes. I was so surprised I was actually able to make chicken marsala like an italian restaurant, being that I am not italian and not much of a cook therefore my expectations were not too high but now with the help of this website and the rating of the members I feel I can now cook anything.  Thank you!!

This is an excellent recipe which has an end product that is top notch. Made a few monir changes to add a little flavor... sauteed chicken breasts with a little minced shallot and used sweet marsala and cream sherry instead of ordinary cooking wines. Came out absolutely fabulous!!!! Will definitely be added to the family faves. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I WISH I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGESTIONS.  It needed more breading, a little more seasoning, some cream and cornstarch to thicken it. Doubling the sauce probably would have been a good idea too. Doing all that would make this a 5 star recipe.

This turned out very nicely but I did modify it taking on suggestions from other cooks.  Because I was only cooking for two I halved the chicken content but left the sauce quantities as is.  I added a short cut bacon rasher and a medium onion, both finely diced and instead of the sherry, I replaced it with more Marsala Wine. After simmering for ten minutes, my sauce was quite thick.   My wife tempted me into stirring a little cream into the sauce at the end and it was beautiful.

This recipe is AWESOME and SO easy. I followed some of the other reviews and used 3/4 cup Marsala wine. I did remove the chicken from the pan (kept the mushrooms in the pan) and then made the sauce. I added the left over flour mixture to the sauce to thicken. I love mushrooms, so I added more.  You will love this dish! Definitely something to cook for family and friends! They will think you spent hours in the kitchen!

I make this for my husband all the time.  Like others, I increase the marsala and decrease the sherry. I also like to add garlic since we love it, and I usually thicken the sauce with a little flour before I serve it.  This is a great recipe.

Delicious and simple to make!  I didn't have any sherry so I just added a bit more of the marsala wine.  I used more mushrooms than the recipe called for and wished I had added even more since my family loves mushrooms.  My boyfriend said it tasted just like you would get in the restaurant but less rich so he can't wait for me to make it again.

This is everything that everyone says it is. My  wife is not one to rave about a meal, but when I made this she said that she thinks it might well be the best meal I have ever made. I have done all of the cooking for the last 5 years, so that is saying something. It is not a difficult recipe, but results in a  meall that one would likely get at a better resturant. Try it. I followed the recipe this time  and will add onion with the mushrooms next time.

I made a lot of mistakes with this recipe and it was still delicious. I forgot to pound the chicken, I forgot to turn the chicken over while simmering, I used a good tasting "cooking marsala", and I didn't use cooking sherry at all (because I hate it). 

When it was done, a pool of oil, butter, and mushrooms was left in the pan. Is it supposed to thicken into sauce? I'm not sure--but I added some cornstarch and water and it thickened up nicely. It tasted very fine indeed! Even the kids liked the chicken, and they hate everything that doesn't come in a happy meal.

This recipe is FOOLPROOF and even a careless cook like me can make a good meal with it.

This is very good, but I'll continue to look for a better sauce... needs to be thicker/syrup-y. Omitted cooking wine b/c Rachel Ray says you should only cook w/ wine you'd drink! (and I concur)

This was so good! I pounded the chicken, then cut them into strips. I also added about 20 medium sized shrimp that we cut in half.  I added some garlic, and used 1 1/2 cup of marsala wine, and no sherry.  I didn't know what to make it with, and used mashed potatoes.  Don't make with mashed potatoes. Rice or noodles would be so much better. Excellent recipe, and will make again.

I couldn't bring myself to prepare this recipe exactly as shown!  So much fat!  I decreased the butter to 1 TBSP, used olive oil spray, and used Perdue 'thin & fit' breasts.  I increased the shrooms to 3 cups.  This dish was fast and tasty.  Not as tasty as I've had before, but again, I decreased the richness in the recipe!  This is a great recipe when you are in a hurry.  Next time, will try a variety of mushrooms~ that would be yummy, too.

Deserves it's 5 star average.  One of the easiest chicken recipes to make and it was really good.  The simmering in the liquid makes the chicken very tender. My husband asked me to make it twice in a row!  However, the first time I used white wine since I didnt have sherry and it was better than the second time when I actually used sherry so I will use white wine from now on.

This was wonderful.  My boyfriend loves Chicken Marsala and this recipe is a keeper - he loved it which says a lot because he's very critical when it comes to Chicken Marsala.  I altered it just a bit because we like a thicker, somwhat sweeter sauce so I made a rue, deglazed the pan with some extra Marsala wine and added it to the mixture at the very end, along with a pinch of sugar to taste and a pinch of nutmeg.  I can't wait to make it again.  This recipe ends my search for that perfect Chicken Marsala - Thanks again!!

The first time I made this I was sure to marinate my pounded chicken for a couple hours.  I then probably doubled the sauce.  It was pretty yummy.  I had a lot of trouble fitting the chicken in my pan...use the biggest you have!  The second time I made it I cut up the pieces of chicken and didn't marinate because of a time shortage, it did not turn out as flavorful.  If you make this be sure to marinate, it makes a huge difference.  I would also advise cutting up the chicken a bit.

Very good dish, quick and easy for a weeknight dinner.  As others suggested, I omitted the sherry and doubled the Marsala. (On subsequent occasions I put the sherry back in but preferred this dish with only Marsala.)  I also added one thinly sliced, previously sauteed red onion to the recipe, at the same time as the mushrooms.  The first time I made this, I thought the amount of oil and butter made the sauce a bit heavy and greasy, so the second time I halved those ingredients.  That was a mistake which ruined the full flavor of this dish.  The third time I used 2/3 of the butter and oil and it was still not as good as the original recipe's ratios, which I still feel is too oily.  Since I have been unable to get the sauce to my exact liking, I might take the suggestion of another reviewer and halve the butter and oil but add some cream at the end.

Very good...However, I read other reviews and added the suggestions of 1 cup Marsala, 1/2 cup Sherry, extra oregano, basil, 2 cups mushrooms and two cloves crushed garlic added when cooking chicken. I also thickened the sauce just a bit with corn starch before serving. Served over Linguini. Delicious!!!

I love this recipe!  As some others have suggested, I doubled up on the marsala wine and sherry.  I also add a bit of heavy cream to thicken the sauce just a little so it's a little more creamy to serve over the angel hair pasta.  Throw in some fresh mushrooms and this is an amazing dish!  I don't like a lot of oil and butter in my dishes, so I halfed the amount and didn't notice a difference at all.  Overall, this is incredible!  Thanks so much!!!

My family and I are not big chicken eaters...but I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I am so happy that I did.  I followed the recipe to a "T" (which is unusual for me) and that is the way it should be, no changes needed on this recipe.  It was fantastic and so simple and quick to make.  I will definately be making this dish again.  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe.

This is such a wonderful recipe. It is simply DELICIOUS!! It was so easy to make. I did add some garlic and some heavy cream to thicken the sauce just a little. The chicken came out tender and juicy.
I cooked my chicken all the way and after it browned I took it out of the pan, sauteed the mushrooms, added the wines, and after about a minute, I put in some heavy cream and then put the chicken back into the sauce for about five minutes, turning it over once.
This recipe is definitely a keeper. I look foward to making this many times over! Thanks for sharing this Lisa.

This recipe was excellent... My father in law makes a great chicken marsala and this one blows his away.. I don't usually like mushrooms but I used baby bella mushrooms and they came out so tasty!! the chicken was moist, I used the thin chicken cutlets instead of pounding out the breast.. and my hubby loved it and he is such a picky eater... I will make this again for sure.

This recipe is awesome and simple, I recommend like some other reviewers that you sautee the mushrooms with some garlic before puttig them in with the chicken. I also thickened up the sauce with cornstarch and I thought that turned out great as well.

I have never made chicken marsala before and this was easy and so delicious.  Next time I will add more mushrooms and use a little less oil/butter.  The chicken browned nicely and cooked evenly.  I let mine sit for about an hour or so before I served it (in my oven warmer drawer) and the sauce thickened nicely.  This was so good.  I made it for 9 people and they are still raving about it months later.  I am making it for mother's day dinner.  This was like eating in a fine restaurant!

not recommended. this recipe is bland, oily, and tasteless. using less oil and more seasonings might help, but it's got a long way to go before it should be served.

My husband would only come within 10 feet of wine if it was kosher, and since there were no kosher Marsala happening to lay around I opted for the Concord Red Wine. I made 6 breasts intstead of 4 and used more ingredients to accomodate the additional chicken. I also added a little bit of dried basil, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning to the mix. I also mixed a little flour and water to the sauce to try and thicken it up. Accidentally, I put in twice as much sherry than I really needed. (The alchohol was pretty strong in both flavor and smell). And even though the dish was still superb, it would have been perfect if I didn't screw up the measurements.

After making this for the umpteeth time, I finally decided to add my rating.  This recipe is my husband's birthday dinner request every year and my kids' frequent request.  Although when I follow the recipe to the letter it is best, I make this so often I wing it now.  I omit mushrooms if I don't have any on hand, I don't measure anything, and I use all types of wine and sherry.  It always comes out tender and tasty.

Absolutely delicious!  I omitted the butter for less fat (44 less grams of fat) and I just used olive oil, which is much healthier.  I only used two chicken breasts and I added more wine and sherry to make more sauce...and of course I added more mushrooms.  The mushrooms really cook down, so use many!  Fast, easy, delicious and healthy!

So easy and so delicious.  Next time I would definitely add more mushrooms to the sauce.  I doubled them the first time I made it and it still wasn't enough for my taste.  Very good!

This recipe was fast, easy and delicious.  My husband raved it about it for days.
That's when I know I have a true winner.  I happened to be out of cooking sherry
and had to substitute a generic red cooking wine, but it still worked out great.

Very easy to make.  It smelled and tasted heavenly!  When I took the lid off the skillet at the end, my immediate reaction was "restaurant quality."  I served it over plain pasta, but rice would be good, too.  The only change my husband (the garlic fanatic) suggested was to add some fresh garlic to the liquid.  I made 8 boneless breasts (using 1/2 cup flour) and saved two for my kids before adding the mushrooms and wine.  My daughter thought the chicken tasted like "Popeye's."  This one is staying in my recipe box.  Thanx, Lisa!

I was disappointed with this but it could be that I used the wrong wine. (I used regular cooking wine) But I did follow the rest of the recipe to a "t".  My kids wouldn't touch it.

This recipe is to die for!! It's absolutely delicious and as good (if not better) than restaurant quality. Do not skimp on the butter, it makes the sauce thicker and richer. I also added 1 Tbs flour to thicken sauce. I've made it with all Marsala and no Sherry and it's just as good. Definately a keeper! I get RAVE reviews everytime I make it. The chicken is so tender and moist.

I thought this recipe was great. Chicken Marsala is one of my favorite dishes and I think when some complain of the blandness or lack of flavor in this recipe they are used to more heavily spiced meals. Chicken Marsala has always had a more subtle flavor to me and this recipe was very easy, very pleasing and a keeper. I didn' use any butter but I added 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I did add a little more Marsala wine and a little more Sherry. I also added a whole pound of sliced mushrooms and used turkey instead of chicken because it was what I had available. I forgot the oregano but added a teaspoon of minced garlic. Not quite the same recipe but I'll keep and play with the original recipe again. It is a great base and easier than the Marsala recipe I had.

This is excellent.  Use good Marsala wine, and good sherry.  I've made it several times, it's always delicious.  I also thicken the sauce.

So easy and delicious!  I made a lot of extra sauce using another 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  To thicken the sauce at the end, I made a quick paste of flour and water and it came out perfect!  We will make this meal again and again!  Thanks!!

This is a simple recipe.  I served it in a cooking class over rice & it was well received.  If you want a thicker sauce add a little corn starch & water.  Also DO NOT USE a COOKING SHERRY but rather a regualr sherry.  Cooking Sherry is too salty & usually of poor quality.

This is a TERRIFIC chicken marsala recipe.  I have tried others in the past, but this one is easy and consistent.  I prepared this for guests recently and received rave reviews.

i used marjoram and not oregano.  i bought a rubber hammer from a discount store and wrap it in plastic wrap or a baggie to keep it clean, it nicer than any meat tenderizer i have ever owned, and i know where it's been - only in the kitchen, and you can use it for other things that need tenderizing and crushing.  a wonderful easy recipe my family prefers homemade meals to anything we can buy out, and are thoroughly spoiled

Needs added seasonings like garlic and onion. Leave out the cooking sherry and use chicken broth instead.

This was a good recipe. I want to make this clear. The recipe itself was good; but it was not something that my husband and I liked. We have particular tastes, and this didn't meet them. It could also have been the fact that we're both celiacs, so making a small change or two to keep this gluten-free may have altered the recipe. It was good, and I ate it. It's just not something we'll do again. Once more, I want to make this clear - this recipe is a good recipe.

I wanted to try chef john's version of this but discovered I was out of chicken stock, so I tried this. I didn't have marsala wine ...heck, I don't even know how to pronounce it. I didn't use sherry and subbed more of the wine and added more mushrooms. this stuff STUNK while it cooked. anyways, after it simmered and reduced I tried it. WOW! I even bought a cheap bottle of the wine ( paul masson ). what a treat!

I made this last week for my husband and I and we couldn't eat it fast enough. The only change I had to make was I had no sherry, so I used 1 full cup Marsala. This was absolutely delicious, easy to make and will definitely be on our menu at least a couple of times a month. I served it over egg noodles but think next time perhaps with rice.

Excellent recipe. The key is to smash the chicken vigorously before flouring and transferring into pan, so the meat absorbs the flavors and practically melts in your mouth.  Excess marsala sauce can be saved and mixed in with other side dishes!

This was my first time making Chicken Marsala and it was fantastic!  I doubled the sauce and added some half and half and flour at the end to thicken the sauce.  I was making it for a large crowd so I cooked the chicken first and stuck it in the oven to finish cooking while I made the sauce.  Time consuming but easy.  Will definitely make again!

Yummy!  I don't normally like chicken marsala but my husband loves it so I went ahead and made it for him.  This was delicious!  We've made it a few times and it has always turned out good.  I used regular sherry instead of cooking sherry, cooking grade alcohol is a lower grade, if it's not worthy of being drank then it's not worthy of marinating my food!

Ooh this was so good!  I didn't realize how easy it was going to be.  I followed the advice of putting the dry ingredients in a baggie to coat the chicken.  This was the least mess I've ever made in the kitchen!  I didn't have sherry so I used 3/4 c. marsala and I also added beef broth, garlic, and some heavy cream towards the end like others recommended.  Next time, I'll add two cartons of mushrooms because one carton was less than I expected.  The sauce was amazing!  I had my misconceptions about how the seasoning was going to be.  At first, I thought the chicken was going to be bland.  The seasoning is just right, so don't worry because it will be tasty!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!  :)

This recipe was very good, but worked better with a few adjustments.  If you want bland, cook as-is.  If you want tastier, add a few more ingredients, like a few cloves of garlic and sliced onions when you cook the mushrooms.  I also had to add more salt and used some fresh chopped parsley.  I had three chicken breasts that were really thick, so I sliced them down the middle and had six breasts.  I had fettucine on hand, but it would work just as well with angel hair or rice.  I will place this in rotation with my changes.  Thanks!

This couldn't be any easier, but it needs a little more flavor for our taste. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will triple the wine and mushrooms. Definitely needs a few cloves of freshly minced garlic, a pinch of salt and maybe some parsley to give it some oomph. Great and simple base though. Thanks for sharing!

I'm a pretty decent cook but even my regular audience was blown away by this offering. I changed it slightly, adding garlic and onions to the oil and butter. After they'd given everything I removed them with a slotted spoon and added fresh garlic slices when the chicken when back in to pan. I also tightened the sauce up a bit with a little cornstarch slurry. Cannot recommend this highly enough. I've used AllRecipes for years but this recipe is the one that made me create an account so I'd never lose dish.

This was so incredibly good I can hardly express how much I loved this! A local Italian restaurant makes this and this recipe was just as good if not better! The only thing I added to this was a little trick I know to make the chicken more tender: just rub baking powder all over the raw chicken and let it sit for 15 minutes or so, then rinse off completely before cooking.

It was very easy to make.  The chicken was tender and the mushrooms tasted great.  Everything else, yuck!  It was bland and the sauce was thin...  I didn't substitute anything and I followed all the directions..  I have no idea why this recipe is rated so high.

Taste in this recipe was great; however, there are a couple of things I would change. Just to add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit and also to cook the meat separate from the sauce. Cooking it all together seemed to poach the meat and the nice brown coating it did have on it disappeared. Overall good recipe though!

I make this recipe all the time but I have some changes that I like. You might or might not, but I receive lots of positives for the altered recipe:
I use panko rather than flour--it's crisper
I use thyme rather than oregano because that is traditional in marsala dishes for a reason--fresh is best or 1 teaspon of dried
I add one small shallot minced at the same time as the mushrooms--really increases flavor
I add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to the wines because panko does not thicken as much as flour.
Otherwise, the order of the steps is the same.

I think most people would like the above changes except for the shallots. If you don't like shallots, leave them out.

Very disappointing. The only thing I changed was using chanterelles instead of regular mushrooms. I can't put my finger on what I didn't like but it was just really bland. Maybe if you added more wine at the end to give it some kick? We won't be making this again, sorry!

Great recipe.  Followed it for the most part in it's entirety, except for some of the tweaks of other reviewers: flour & spices in ziploc (i always do this--so much easier & cleaner), doubled the mushrooms, used 1 1/2 the amount of marsala & sherry, but will double next time, and added garlic to the mushrooms. Agree that using better quality wine is important (decent marsala & sherry are not expensive).  I didn't find any need to add creams or thickeners.  This is an easy dinner with  restaurant quality presentation and taste.  Great job!

Excellent, I followed some of the others advise and added more mushrooms and made more sauce for the pasta. I also added some thinly sliced shallots and some minced garlic before the mushrooms.

Such a delicious recipe, keep in mind it's important to use a real authentic Marsala wine from Sicily if you can get hold of one instead of those Marsala cooking wine found in the grocery stores to experience the real good taste of this recipe.

I doubled the sauce, added a teaspoon of corn starch and some minced garlic.... It was great!!! As good or better than the restaurant. I used sweet Marsala, not dry.

Better than in most restaurants, in my opinion. I used half marsala and half chicken broth - no sherry, as I didn't have any and never use it. Borrowing a hint from another reviewer, I added a little cornstarch/water mixure to thicken the sauce. Super delicious chicken marsala!!

Pretty tasty but definitely needed more salt. Instead of the heavy whipped cream I added a dash of milk. I also added some onions like others suggested. Served it with Mashed Potatoes and Carrots.

Great looking meal, great tasting! Added garlic and onion while heating up the butter with oil. Used canned mushrooms but will use fresh next time since there will be a next time!

As written it's good.  However... I always use JUST a good marsala wine.  Also, the flour mixture needs extra seasoning.  A little onion powder, and paprika for color.  I also add smashed garlic to the oil before adding mushrooms.  And definitely double the mushrooms, you won't be disappointed.

I wish I had NOT added the sherry. I'd made this once before with just Marsala and it was delicious. This time I followed the recipe as written and the sauce was so sour and bitter I had to "doctor" it to salvage the dish.

Added cornstarch and water mixture to sauce to thicken and some milk.  Make sure you slice the mushrooms.  Leaving them whole does not taste as good.

It was awesome. We had it with spagetti squash instead of pasta. I followed some of the advice given and added 2 cloves of garlic to the butter and oil. I used cooking wine & broth. It was still awesome. Hubby LOVED it. Needed more sauce so next time I'll double the wine & broth. Thanks!

It was ok... I don't know if I was missing something, but it was Carrabas... My husband liked it.. I mean I did too, but something wasn't right. I didn't use Sherry. I did what others said and used 3/4 cups of Marsala. 

I'd definitely try it again. Oh, I also didn't use breast. I'd started thawing out drumsticks, and used them. **shrugs** Either way, It was a nice take on chicken, since I don't eat it that often

Soooo good with my own changes.  Like a previous post, I added sliced garlic while cooking the chicken (omitted oregano from flour mixture) and cream, chicken broth, and a slurry to thicken at the end.  I also added a few splashes of red wine, garlic powder, onion powder (about 1/2 - 1 tsp each), crushed rosemary (rosemary's my girl - she makes everything work) and basil (about a tsp each)....sooooo good....exactly what I was craving

This is an OUTSTANDING recipe!  I've made this several times, both by following it with the precision of a chemical engineer, as well as modifying to suit whatever is in my cupboards.
As is, it's virtually perfect because it's easy, cheap and fast.  The only very minor recommendation I could make is to extend the cooking time a tiny bit.  I simmer at a lower temp for 15 or so minutes, then I set the pan aside to rest while I remove some of the juices, cool them in the freezer, and afterwards mix in a little cornstarch.  Then I pour that back into the pan and bring the temp back up for another couple of minutes to thicken the sauce and cook the cornstarch. (I'm too lazy to do a true reduction I guess)
:-)

My husband loves chicken marsala, but I've always thought it was too complicated to make.  This recipe was easy, fast, and delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I cut back on the butter and oil a little and cook the mushrooms and sauce separate from the chicken.  But that's the only change.  I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to make this dish.

Delicious!

Modifications - used only Marsala wine, no sherry.  Didn't have sherry and didn't want to buy it for 1 recipe.  I just used Marsala in it's place.  Also, I doubled the recipe except for the butter and olive oil amounts.  I kept those the same.  Might have been oily if I had doubled.  I can't imagine needing to add cream or milk for richness...the sauce thickened up well w/ the mushrooms and was SO flavorful.  Will make again and again!

This is one of the BEST dishes I've ever made!  Better than restaurant marsala, in my opinion.  We ate it over pasta but it would be great with mashed potatoes, too.

This tasted like a 5 star recipe, but I gave it 4 stars because it was very oily. Next time I will only use the olive oil instead of both butter and oil. Other than it being oily, it tasted amazing. I never knew chicken marsala would be so easy to make!

Connie’s Tips for this Dish
•	You don’t need to use the Sherry in the recipe..i left it out and it tasted delicious anyways. 
•	Also- when I did the first step, I used a big clear ziplock bag to mix the flour etc to the chicken. Less of a mess. 
•	I cooked it with baby bella mushrooms and added some scallop to dress it up. 
•	But if you don’t want to complicate, just the chicken, mushroom over pasta was sooooooo delicious. 
•	Also to make it more gourmet, I added a couple dashes of half/half or heavy cream (whatever you have in the fridge) to give it a creamy gourmet taste.
•	Hey, Italian seasoning is awesome. Sprinkle some!

Although I selected this recipe because of it's high rating, I can only rate it two stars.  No one in my family of four enjoyed this dish.

YUM! I've made this dish multiple times now. The first time I tried to cut back on the butter for a healthier eat... don't do it. You need the butter!! :) This is a tasty easy gourmet meal.

This was so easy to make (trust me when I say that I'm a beginner) and it was quite good. The mushrooms had an amazing flavor and the chicken was juicy and delicious. I think it took me about 45 minutes from start to finish! I would definitely recommend this dish for a weeknight, it's fast, easy and yummy.

I modified the recipe a bit.  I sauteed garlic and thinly sliced onions in a little olive oil.  I added a bit of chicken stock and some sliced mushrooms and let them cook down a  bit.  Then I added the breaded chicken and 3/4 cup of Marsala.  I let the chicken breasts cook for about 20 minutes, flipping them a few times.  I pulled the chicken out, and added about 1/2 cup of low fat Greek yogurt, and mixed the sauce well.  I then put the chicken back in the sauce, and returned the pan to the stove to cook for about five more minutes.  The chicken was perfectly moist. I served over linguini with asparagus on the side.  It was really good.

This recipe was very good but I agree that a heavy cream should also be added to the sauce to make it thicker instead of a sort of broth.

Excellent ! The only thing I did differently, was use a home-made Shiraz instead of a Marsala. I guess that would make this Chicken Shiraz.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I followed reviews that stated to use all Marsala wine.  I thought it was very sweet that way, using the 1/4 cup of cooking sherry with its added salt might be better.  Seemed like a lot of butter, I would cut to 2 tbsp. mixed with the olive oil.

I love chicken marsala, but I did not care for this recipe.  I made it as written.  I chose this recipe for its simplicity, but I think I'll stick to my mom's more involved (but tastier) recipe from now on.

This is an amazing recipe that is relatively fast to prepare and cook. I used marsala cooking wine and it turned out delicious. Make sure to really pound the chicken breast down or slice it thin all around; there were a few parts of the chicken in which I didn't, and they didn't taste as tender as the rest of the chicken. I served over a cheesy parmesan cavatappi and it all went together superbly. Will be using again!

Not a fan of this recipe. Could have been the brand of Marsala, but had a strange aftertaste - a little sweet, and as written, the sauce is quite thin and bland. If I were to try it again I would try using a drier white wine, a little garlic and would add some half and half for a little body in the sauce ........ but that probably isn't THIS recipe.

With a few minor changes, this recipe is delicious. Not to mention, a thirty minute meal! I followed the instructions as is for cooking the chicken; however I'd strongly suggest seasoning the chicken with additional salt & pepper before coating it in flour. As another reviewer suggested, I added both onions & mushrooms to the browned chicken. I doubled the wine & sherry, and added one chicken bouillon and 6-8 sliced sun-dried tomatoes to the mixture. At the very end, I added a splash of 2% milk to make it creamier. I served this over angel hair pasta. My husband suggested I make more sauce next time, as it really is quite delicious with the pasta. And please, please consider adding sun-dried tomatoes, it sounds strange, but tastes delicious! Note, I used tomatoes that were dried without a liquid; however next time I will be sure to buy the ones that are soaked in olive oil.

This was really good...and I don't even really like chicken marsala. I made it for my husband and decided to eat it as well and was pleasantly surprised. He said it was better than some Italian restaurants! The first time I made it I followed the ingredients exact and it was good and the second time I made it I only used 2 tbsp. oil & 2 tbsp. butter. I added some minced garlic, used 3/4 c. marsala wine & 1/4 c. chicken broth. And both times I made it I browned the chicken in just the oil, added the mushrooms, wine and let it simmer per the directions, but then after about 10 minutes I removed the chicken, increased the heat and reduced the sauce a bit. I then removed it from the heat and whisked in the butter. Delicious!

Loved this! However, I doubled the Marsala and Sherry Wine and did add 1/2 cup of heavy cream. I didnt care for the bitter taste of the mushrooms because they were cooked in the wine so next time we are sauting up seperate then adding at the end.

When I need a recipe, I always turn to this site.  I look at the number of reviews and the one with the most is the one I choose.  This marsala is a total winner and unlike these other cooks, the recipe is written as the author created it, so why would you "tweek" it??
Perfect as written!

Great recipe, I filleted the chicken instead of pounding flat.  I added the remainder of the flower and spices to the oil after I browned the chicken to make a rue and then added the liquids.  I also substituted Marsala Wine for the sherry since we did not have any sherry.  Still turned out so good that my daughter ate 2 helpings worth.

Smelled so good while it was cooking.  Used the boneless/skinless chicken tenders, so they was no pounding involved. Used fresh sliced mushrooms. Made it with risotto, but next time I might try thickening up the sauce for pasta.
Could not have been any easier to make.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it about 3 times now and my family loves it.  I have tweeked it just a bit.  1. I buy the boneless skinless thin sliced chicken breasts. 2. I don't use the Sherry called for (not sure if this would taste right). 3. I use 3/4 cup chicken broth and 3/4 cup of Marsala. 4. I add garlic powder to the flour mixture to coat the chicken.  It turns out great everytime and is super quick and easy for a weeknight dinner.

Great dish. the tastes blended harmoniously when made properly. my family loved it and most likely will become something we eat often. if the taste is too strong use less sherry and a little more butter(variations depending on preferences).

Didn't use cooking sherry and doubled the amount of mushrooms.  I also used 1/2 cup of marsala wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I will double the amount of wine and broth next time though because there was not enough sauce.  I served it over mashed potatoes so more sauce is needed.

This was delicious! I also placed the flour and seasonings in a bag and coated the chicken by shaking it in the bag.  I added chicken broth and did a mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.  Very easy. Thank you for a great recipe.

the chicken was very moist, but if not for the additional sliced onion and 2 cloves of garlic, I think this would have been a waste of time and money (boring).  Maybe I should have served over some pasta.  It was just ok and will probably not make again

I've made this a few times already, and every time the flavor is just fabulous! The only things I would change would be to add cornstarch + water for some extra sauce (or heavy cream if you like) and plenty more mushrooms.

A good base recipe! I like a very flavorful chicken coating, so I added quite a few extra spices (just to taste- paprika, more salt, more pepper, a healthy portion of crushed cayenne). I didn't have any marsala wine, so I used chicken stock instead and it was great! I also added one clove of minced garlic with the mushrooms, which was a great pop of flavor. Once the chicken cooked, I took it out of the pan and tossed my cooked spaghetti in with the mushrooms and garlic, adding a splash of chicken stock and some garlic salt to the pasta to flavor it and pull up the pan dripping. With the additions, the flavor was very bold and tasted restaurant-quality.

This recipe is the bomb!!  My family of 6 can't seem to get enough of this wonderful dish.  That includes our pickey eaters.  I always double this recipe in hopes of having leftovers but my husband and kids clean up every bit the first night.  The only change I've made is to omit the sherry only because I never have any on hand and don't ever remember to buy it.  Thanks so much Lisa for sharing a great recipe.

I love chicken marsala when cooked correctly.  I made a few changes.  I seasoned the chicken and let it sit in some buttermilk for a few minutes.  I then in a zip lock bag, added some onion powder, a little salt, plenty of pepper and the flour.  I dredged the chicken in the flour mixture and let it sit while I heated up the oil and butter.  As the chicken was browning, I sliced up some fresh mushrooms and threw everything in the skillet.  Once the chicken was done browning on both sides, I removed the chicken and thickened up the sauce by adding in some heavy cream and a some chicken broth - I also added in another 1/4 cup of the marsala wine.  As the sauce thickened, I placed the chicken back in the pan and turned the heat to low and I let the chicken simmer in the sauce for about 10-15 minutes as I cooked my rice.  

The key thing to great marsala is the marsala wine.  Use liberally and taste the sauce and continue to add as you continue to cook!

I love this recipe! I have done it two different ways now. First I did exactly as the recipe stated and it was great. The second time I took some other views advise and made a cream sauce by adding half and half and using a slurry to thicken it. I also removed the chicken after browning it (which I had cut in half after pounding) and made the sauce then added the chicken back in. I didn't have cooking sherry so I did double the amount of Marsala wine instead, turned out great. Plan on making it tonight for my family and this time using some garlic, and Italian spice in the flour mixture. Served with homestyle noodles. Splendid Recipe Lisa, thanks so much for sharing.

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy, quick and almost like Olive Garden!!!  I couldn't figure out what missing... it was a little blond in color, and bland,  so I ended up adding 2 tablespoons chicken bouquet (per 4 servings).  WOW, what a difference!  Now, whenever I want chicken marsala I can have it in my own kitchen!  I give it 5 stars after the kitchen bouquet.

I wanted to do something a little different with my chicken and ran across this recipe. This is one of the best chicken dishes I've ever made. I made this dish per the recipe with the exception of doubling the amount of mushrooms. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the marsala was incredible. As with several other reviewers, I highly recommend using good quality Marsala and Sherry when cooking. If you wouldn't drink it, you should't be cooking with it. Also, I recommend using baby portebello mushrooms. Absolutely wonderful!

This recipe was great! However, I would double the sauce if you plant to serve with pasta. I would also add onion and garlic with the chicken for more flavor.

The only changes I made were to add a few chopped garlic cloves and I didn't have any sherry so I used all Marsala.  The family really liked it so I will make it again but I thought it was really bland.  It needs herbs and spices to liven it up for my taste.  I also used regular mushrooms so next time I'll try some portabellas and shiitakes.

I made this for 20 people for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I wish there had been more leftovers, b/c I think it was even better reheated. My only change was to cook some onions with the mushrooms, and a little butter to finish the sauce at the end.

DEFINITELY 5 STARS!!!!  I've made MANY chicken marsala recipes and this was the only one my husband and I both loved!!  I doubled the shrooms and doubled the marsala.  Added 6 cloves of minced garlic while sauteing the mushrooms and served over angel hair pasta with a side of roasted zucchini. Fabulous!

I am going to give this receipe 3 stars b/c it is the basics of what you need to make really great chicken marsala. I have only made it once and am still experimenting. I took other's advice and removed the browned chicken from the pan and then added mushrooms, about a tbsp. more of butter and a drizzle of olive oil. I also added onions, garlic and shallots (shallots are definitely a traditional ingredient to this dish and I'm surprised more people don't mention using them). Then I added chicken broth and after it cooked a while, I added the marsala and the cream. I actually ended up adding quite a bit of butter, broth & oil to the recipe and the sauce was rich and good but I still need to work on it.  Then I added the chicken. Be sure to keep stirring though or the sauce does separate a little.  I am making it this week for dinner and am going to add asparagus tips to the mushrooms, onions & shallots. Thanks-my son, my mom and I all loved this!

Mmmmmm.....along with the other almost-2000-people, this was super yummy. I made this for 20 people in my grad class ane everyone loved it. The breading is wonderful. I used fresh oregano and added some chicken broth to the wine and a little corn starch to thicken. I will be making this again! Thanks!

This was a great recipe for a basic marsala.  I've always been a fan of marsala cream sauce so I added a little sour cream to the sauce half way through simmering

Excellent as written but of course had to tweak due to what I had on hand.  Used shallot salt, chicken tenders and doubled the heavenly sauce to saturate pasta.  I've made Macaroni Grill's recipe but this is a tad bit better with the addition of Sherry.  Thanks so MUCH!!

This Sounds Heavenly, and just the dish I intend to make myself for my upcoming birthday!!  I will take a few hints from previous reviewers (I love the idea of onions with the mushrooms) and since mushrooms are a particular favorite of mine, I may "splurge", I just can't wait to have this dish!!  Thanks for sharing!

i doubled this, which was great, added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, garlic, onion and took out the cooking sherry.  It was such a large amount that i had to do the browning in batches and place in a baking dish, make the sauce in the pan and pour it over the chicken (reserving some since i had so much) then i baked it in the oven for 30 min , until the chicken was no longer pink....we loved it !!!

Great, and actually as quick and easy at it says! I added Italian bread crumbs to the flour mixture. Also, I thickened the sauce with milk and the leftover flour-oregano mixture, which worked great. Leaving it simmering as instructed works perfectly well.

Look no further for a Chicken Marsala recipe!  I made it for the first time this evening, was so delicious.  I used "Cream Sherry" from the liquor store ~ not sure if that made the recipe any better than a "cooking sherry" you could get in the grocery store but I was incredibly happy with how it turned out.  Served with mashed red skinned potatoes which is a wonderful combination.  I could see that a little splash of heavy cream might be good as recommended in previous reviews so I will try that next time.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe no matter what you do.  It's great as written.  I did make minor changes, as others have, to suit our taste.  After doing the plastic bag trick with the flour and spices, I brown the chicken with fresh minced garlic and then  remove it to brown the mushrooms (doubled the amount) and some red onion.  There's not enough room in the pan to brown the mushrooms really well if the chicken is in there.  We like a lot of gravy, so I added some chicken broth to the Marsala (as others have mentioned, use the real thing  - and lots of it).  I didn't use Sherry, but a little white wine, as that's all I had.  I do thicken it at the end with a touch more broth and corn starch, and we like it on whole grain pasta.  I garnish with a little fresh parsley for added color.  This is definitely a dish that your family and company will rave about.  And it's so simple to make!

I made this using chicken tenderloins and  wild oyster mushrooms (I cooked the mushrooms separately) I kept the mushrooms and chicken warm in the oven while I thickened the reduced wine mixture with arrowroot (cornstarch would work also).  Then I poured the sauce over all.  Next time I make this I will mix chicken broth 50/50 with the wine as we all agreed the 'gravy' was too wine-y.  The chicken and mushrooms were perfectly delicious!

I've made this many times using this recipe as my base recipe and always do something different each time, either make more sauce, add more mushrooms, extra seasoning. It's wonderful as is or very easy to build on.Tonight I removed the chicken and cooked 2 pieces of bacon in the pan then removed them and set aside before making the sauce. Added 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the pan then before it got too dark put in my wine, sherry, and mushrooms. put the chicken back in, then crumbled the bacon and a bit of crushed red pepper over the top before covering and simmering.

This is an excellent recipe. My husband even loved it and he is sometimes hard to please. I think that this is the same as or even better than my favorite chicken marsala that I get from a famous restaurant. The only changes I made is I only used 1 Tbsp of olive oil and only 1 Tbsp of butter. I did add a little garlic powder. Also, I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce.  It turned out perfect! I will definitely be making this again.

I was recently looking for a new (to me) chicken recipe and stumbled across this last week.  I'd heard of it but never had chicken this way.  I was impressed and so was my partner.  Neither of us are fans of sherry but I decided to follow the recipe to the letter.  I'm glad I did; the flavour was awesome (as was the aroma in the kitchen!)  I served it with rice and green beans.

Excellent! Mine tasted just like the chicken marsala at the fine dining Italian restaraunts.  However, the only wine I really have in the house is Riesling.  So, instead of 1/2 cup of Marsala and 1/4 cup of cooking sherry, I just used 3/4 cup of Riesling. But, still great! A little work, but super yummy!

This was a great and simple dish.  I subsituted a few ingredients and added a few ingredients other reviewers suggested.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt, added a little more oregeno than called for.  I also put in dried parsley flakes to the flour.  I used Pinot Grigio wine since I didn't have Marala wine; worked out great!  Towords the end as the sauce was simmering; I added some half and half to make it creamier.  My family loved this recipe; it has become a family favorite!  Thanks.

AWESOME!!! I did not use sherry made a little more sauce..perfect. I used 4 T butter + 1/3 c EVOO. Used 1 & 1/2 c marsala sweet wine. When I flipped chicken to cook on other side, I added 3 cloves chopped garlic with the mushrooms. Then removed chicken and added 1/2 c heavy cream and 1/3 c chicken broth mixed wth 2 T corn starch...cooked until slight thickened and then added chicken back. Also put flour in paper bag for easier clean up.

This was an excellent dish - simple & quick to  make and my family loved it.  I served it over orecchiette pasta that I sauced with some of the marsala gravy first.  It was a real hit and will make again. Thank you for sharing.

My suggestion: Cook chicken first add crushed garlic then remove to dish. Make the wine/mushroom sauce in same pan. Add salt to sweeten also heavy cream and some chicken broth and flour to thicken.

Awesome dish. I've made this at least a half dozen times for my family, and they all love it. I prefer to make this with rice on the side, since the marsala sauce goes so well on it, but linguine is a favorite. I eventually changed the recipe as follows (based on suggestions): omit sherry and use 3/4C marsala, then double the sauce; triple the mushrooms; add Italian seasoning to dry ingredients; add a splash of heavy cream; use a little bit of cornstarch to thicken sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe, but added some garlic and onion.  Would not have given it 5 stars because the flavor did not have the depth I expected and was missing something.

Has turned into one of my favorite dishes! Have tried it with a little added garlic & onion - even better! Just added to the oil/butter when browning the chicken.   Also, have never used the cooking sherry - not something I had on hand when I first made the dish.

This was fabulous! I made this for two so I of course had left overs and can't wait to eat them! I read some alterations comments and took the advice to not use the sherry wine and substituted the sherry wine for more marsala wine. I also used about 1/4 cup of a corn starch and water mixture. I probably could have added another 1/4 cup of the corstarch mixture though. Also I added fresh garlic (about 4 cloves chopped) when cooking the chicken. I did not take the chicken out after browning, I just made sure to stir the mushrooms on med-high heat for a couple mins before letting it simmer. I also added a little garlic powder to the flour mixture to coat the chicken before browning. I served with garlic and butter angel hair pasta and a side of broccoli. It was amazing and can't wait to eat it again!

Easy and delicious meal. Served it with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. I also doubled the sauce and made 5 pieces of chicken instead of 4 to accomodate company. I was concerned at first with cooking the chicken in the sauce (some recipes have you remove it first then add it back to the pan later) as I thought it would have made the flour coating come off easily (it did on one when I moved it). Luckily the remainder stayed on nicely and I was careful to remove them from the pan gently. We spooned the sauce onto the mashed potatoes it was so good. I would make this again. . Everyone liked it.

I know there are a ton of reviews on this but just had to add my own twist to the recipe. First off I try to do as much the day before in prep as I can, it makes things much easier when I go to cook the dish. I doubled the mushrooms and sauteed them in butter/oil/salt n pepper, just till they released their juices. I also carmelized an onion. I put this away in a tupperware in the fridge. I then took my chicken breasts and thinned them so I had half chicken breasts. I then put those away. The day of, I floured the chicken breast halves as the recipe called for using more oregeno and sauteed them on one side. (I had to do it in batches) I then put the chicken back in the pot raw flour side down, and added the mushrooms and onion with their juice. I added a little more marsala, and a little more sherry to make plenty of sauce. I use a good drinking sherry, not cooking sherry. I braised for 20 minutes stirring twice. I was outstanding. I served this over fettuccine dressed with olive oil/butter/salt n pepper/parsley.

This turned out perfect.  I omitted the breading on the chicken and just browned it in a little Olive Oil.  Even my 8yr old loved it.

took out the chicken after frying using mostly olive oil, kept them in oven at 250 (next time should try 200).  Used marsala wine only, and added some half and half for the sauce to make it a little creamy.  sauteed the onion and mushroom, then add the wine. very tasty.  served with pasta, garlic and basil.  bread is a must to soak up the sauce.

Exquisite and ridiculously easy! I would recommend pounding the chicken, cutting down on the butter and oil (I used three Tspn oil and actually one scoop of margarine), threw some garlic into the oil/butter mix and doubled the marsala/sherry sauce. My boyfriend said it's better than any restaurant chicken he's ever had.

Fabulous dish! This is the best homemade chicken marsala recipe! I only made one change - once the chicken was cooked through, I removed it from the skillet. Next, I added about 2 Tablespoons of flour to the mushrooms and sauce. I cooked the sauce on med-high heat for 7-8 minutes, stirring constantly. Finally, I poured the thickened sauce over the chicken. For side dishes, I served Pasta e Olio (allrecipes.com recipe) and green beans...EXCELLENT MEAL!

This is a reaaly great recipe. It was my 2nd time around of making it. I took the advice of some viewers, I coated the chicken in the bag instead of a bowl. I tripled the mushrooms. (welike them). I used real Marsala wine this time around, it was better. I also doubled the wine and sherry for extra sauce. I thicken the sauce at the end as well to my likeing. I didn't use cornstarch, just flour since thats all I had around. I put the flour in a bowl and dripped water in as I stirred it. Then I added the chicken back in to simmer a couple of minutes. I made thin spaghetti noddles on the side like in picture with E.V.O.O, butter and spices. And I made sweet peas, salad and my own garlice parmesan bread as well with it. Very, Very good. This is the best Chicken Marsala recipe I have found and tasted. Thanks for the ideas....

AWESOME!! I added a 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup milk, and the sauce was perfect. My father-in-law, who puts hot sauce on everything, told me he didn't want to ruin the flavor with it! Very easy to make, and restaurant quality. THANKS!!

The best Chicken Marsala ever!  I've made a few minor changes:  I saute mushrooms in butter & oil first.  Remove from pan, cook chicken 5-7 min both sides.  Then add marsala wine, 1/2 c chicken broth (instead of sherry) and add the mushrooms back.  Bring to boil, simmer for 20 min.  In sm. bowl, mix 1 tbsp of cornstarch to 1/4 c cold water.  Remove chicken and keep warm.  Add cornstarch/watter mixture to pan to thicken sauce. Cook for 2-5 min. until thickened to your taste.  My daughter loves linquini with this so we need extra sauce and this works the best.  Enjoy!

This Chicken Marsala is FANTASTIC! So delicious. Take the time to pound the chicken so that it will be tender and cook quicker. Be sure to add both the wine AND sherry. I've made it with both and with just the wine and it's better with both! VERY GOOD!

My boyfriend made this for me for my birthday...it was spectacular! Chicken marsala is one of my favorite meals, and this dish was better than many I have had at restaurants! We used a garlic/Italian herb-marinated chicken breast from a local market, which added great additional flavor, and he also added a little bit of heavy cream to thicken the sauce. We used half of the amount of chicken required, and I think the chicken to sauce ratio was perfect (but I am also huge fan of the sauce, and couldn't have had enough). We served it over angel hair pasta,  but I think it would be great with some kind of rustic mashed potatoes.

I followed the directions and it turned out a tad bit bland. I added extra wine and cooked it a little longer to try and help it out, it didn't work. I'm going to stick with my old stand by.

Family and guest loved this recipe.  I added minced garlic, 2 tsp. parsley and increaded the Marsala wine instead of using the Sherry. The sauce was very tasty, I also simmered for a  least an hour and the sauce thickened to perfection.  I made Garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish, excellent combination.   Enjoy we sure did.!!! Very easy recipe.

The Sherry made this so strong that we could not eat it! And I cook with wine all the time. I had to dump everything back into the pot and add a cup of chicken broth just so we could eat it!

This dish is definitely restaurant quality chicken marsala!  I have made this several times, and its very quick and easy, even on weeknights.  If you like more of the sauce, I recommend doubling the sherry, marsala wine and mushrooms. I serve this with roasted potatoes, and a seasoned vegetable medley.  I used Florio brand marsala wine.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was really good!  I did make a number of changes though, hence the 4-star rating.  The changes I made: 
(1)I used an entire package of mushrooms. (2)I only used 3T of both the oil and the butter. (3)I used 3/4c. Marsala cooking wine instead of both Marsala and Sherry.  Next time I will still use all Marsala, but I will use a good wine instead of cooking wine. (4)I added a splash of both half-and-half and chicken broth to the sauce. (5)Just before serving I removed the chicken from the pan and in a small bowl I made a mixture of a little bit of water and a little bit of cornstarch, stirred it well and added it to the sauce to help thicken it a bit.  Then poured the sauce over the plated chicken.  Next time I will definitely do all of this again and will probably add a clove of garlic while browning the chicken, and serve it over angelhair pasta.  Yum!!

I can't believe how good this turned out. I did what a few others mentioned and took the ck out of the pan while making the sauce. I added a cornstarch mixture and a dash of heavy cream. I sldo tripled the sauce so that there would be enough to put over angel hair pasta I served it with. My boyfriend and his mom said that it was the best they ever had!

Delicious! I made two modifications: I didn't use sherry and I added extra marsala wine and then a "slurry" of cornstarch/water mixture suggested by other poster. Absolutely delicious. Next time there will only be one change....I will use more salt on the chicken breasts. Thanks for the recipe!

This was divine and I followed several users suggestions so thanks!!!  I used a ziplock bag for the coating which worked like a charm.  For the mushrooms I used a whole pack of sliced mushrooms and a some sliced portabello.  Next time I plan to try some porcini mushrooms.  When cooking chicken, I added some minced garlic.  I trippled the sauce.  I love sauce!!!  I purchased Florio Sweet Marsala from Liquer store, I heard this one rocks!!!  I added a little water/cornstarch to make a bit thicker and a dash of heavy cream.  I brought a plate to my mom's and when she tried she called and raved about the sauce!!!  It was finger licking good.  Served with buttered Pennsylvania Dutch Homestyle Egg Noodles, crescent rolls and brocolli.  All was YUMMY!!!!

We loved this! My husband who has said in the past that he doesn't like chicken Marsala...had two BIG helpings and finished every bit of sauce. I served this on a light egg fettucine.  Also made the following changes: Used the same amount of oil and butter but doubled the Marsala and wine (used white wine) sauted the chicken and then took it out and kept it warm, then sauted the mushrooms and added shallots and garlic powder (didn't have any fresh garlic). Added flour mixture at the end to thicken.  This is really a keeper...can't wait to make this again!

Pretty good.  Followed recipe exactly.  Needed to thicken sauce at end with cornstarch slurry.  Good recipe as is, but will make a few changes next time (garlic, maybe onion, mascarpone cheese, et al).

this recipe is restaurant quality! i followed the instructions to a tee and it came out perfect. The only thing i will do differently next time I make is add the leftover flour mix to the wine/sherry sauce  prior to mixing it in. I know some people have recommended whipping cream and the like but what makes this recipe one of my favorites is that it's a wine sauce, not a cream sauce!

This is one of my favorites when I order out so I finally decided to find a recipe and cook it at home.  My boyfriend and I loved it!  I didn't have sherry on hand so I just used 3/4 cup of Marsala wine and served chicken over brown rice-wonderful!

I made this for guests and they were very impressed. Delicious recipe!!! I would add more mushrooms, and make sure you cover them completely with the sauce while cooking.

Now I know why this is one of the most popular recipes in this site! This truly is worthy of 5 stars. I used tenderloins instead of the whole chicken breast (cooked faster and didn't dry out). I browned them in olive oil and butter then took them out. I then sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic, added 1/2 cup of sweet marsala (I used Nando), deglazed the pan and let it reduce a little bit (didn't use sherry). I added 1 cup chicken broth with 1 T cornstarch, and lastly 2 T of fat free half/half. I put the chicken back in and let everything cook for about 2 minutes. I served it over fettuccini. My family and I LOVED this dish. My son said it was like eating in a restaurant! I will be making this dish often for sure. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was excellent, I didn't change anything other than to double the marsala sauce and allow to thicken. Served with a simple pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, and basil. Great recipe!!!

This is one of my personal favorite recipes.  Of course I throw in a couple things that depict my style but all in all I stay pretty close to the recipe.  Everyone I've made it for so far has enjoyed it as well.

This did not taste like some of the chicken marsalas I like in the restaraunts, however, this does taste very good.  The second time I made it I doubled the sauce to make more gravy.  I also tried these ingredients in a crock pot with a roast, also very good.

This is a very good recipe. My family doesn't like mushrooms so I only add a small amount. Will definitely make again!

After reading most of the reviews I thought this would be an awsome chicken, I got so dissapointed with the results, first, it was way too much oil and butter, second, you could taste the flour, the sauce didn't taste like much it needed a lot of seasoning. I served it with spaghetti and my family after tasting the chicken just ate the pasta, sorry!

Can I give it 10 stars??!!! Darn, this is so good and so easy! I made it to the letter first time around, it was awesome. Tonight I am putting spinach in, since I don't have any shrooms. I am sure it will be awesome as well. Rarely do I get excited about left overs, but this chicken is just as good second day in! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipes! I used chicken breast cutlets, doubled the amount of mushrooms (used baby portabellos, normal button, and shitake) and then added heavy cream to the liquid, cooked a bit then added rock shrimp and poured over the top of the chicken. Served this at a catered buffet- everyone enjoyed it! Oh- also cut back the marsala wine just a bit. Overall, a great recipe, with or without the adjustments!

I followed this exact recipe.  It is almost the exact same recipe as the Olive Garden hideout recipe and to me it was very bland and not like the Olive Garden's chicken marsala at all.

This dish was pretty good. The sauce was a little runny, and I prefer to have a thicker sauce. I did make it a little healthier by using Promise spread instead of butter and instead of flour, I coated the chicken in crushed pine nuts.

Simple, quick and delicious. I doubled the chicken in this recipe but not the Marsala. Instead, I added about a cup of chicken broth (with a tablespoon of cornstarch)and the Marsala wine to taste. Approx. 1/2 cup. I also undercooked the mushrooms in wine mixture before I cooked the chicken. Then heated it all up together right before serving.

This was good but maybe I didn't do something right. Isn't chicken marsala a brown sauce? Mine wasn't brown at all. It was still good and I will make it again.

This recipe doesn't need another fab review but I'll add one anyway... It was really easy and tasted great.  I did add garlic while cooking the chicken for added flavor.  I also followed other suggestions and removed the chicken while cooking the mushrooms.  When the mushrroms were almost done I also added a whole bag of spinach I needed to use up.  Really great recipe Lisa:-)

Excellent recipe! I was late making dinner, but wanted an easy and fairly quick recipe. This was served with pasta tossed in olive oil with a side of Pillsbury crescents.  DH raved about it; said it was as good as the ones from a restaurant. I used seasoned salt for the breading.  For next time: I will double the sauce, add garlic and onions, pound the chicken even more, and thicken the sauce a bit. A definite keeper; thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce thickened as it was supposed to. I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and roasted zucchini. There wasn't a bite left.

this was really good for me, but i did change a few things...i dipped the chicken in a milk and egg mixture before dredging it in flour, i also used more seasonings than the recipe called for; more salt, some fresh thyme, garlic salt, and more pepper.  i used 5 tbsp of olive oil instead of adding the butter.  yummy!

This was delicious! I however added more marsala and a little bit of cream(about 1 tbs). I used veal as well as chicken since my boyfriend loves veal and it was just as good. I will definitley keep this recipe.

Made this for hubby and I on our Friday "date night" (does it count if the kids are 20 feet away watching The Aristocats? LOL!).  We both thought it was very good, and DH is even pickier than I am.  The chicken was very moist and tender, and the sauce was nearly perfect - not too thick, not too runny - but we both found it to be a tad too sweet.  Next time I think I will bump up the garlic (I used roasted garlic in a jar), and perhaps a bit more freshly ground sea salt.  Overall, though, very yummy and a definite keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is good, but I have another recipe that I like better that omits the cooking sherry wine and increases the marsala wine; then when the chicken is done cooking, it is removed to a plate, and the remaining liquid is reduced down; makes the flavor more intense.  I also cut the olive oil & butter in half on this; just seemed like too much grease, and I'm glad I did.  On the suggestion of another reviewer, I sauteed some onion with this too before I put the chicken in the oil/butter and it was a nice touch.

Very quick & simple recipe with great flavor.  No need to pound chicken. Just simply butterfly the chicken breast and then cut into serving sizes. I found this was really easy to do with thick, partially defrosted breasts.  I added a sweet onion that I sauteed first & took out while I browned the chicken pieces, keeping them warm on a heated plate as I had doubled the recipe.  Then I added onion, mushrooms from a jar (this made it really simple & they tasted surprisingly good -- handy to have in the cabinet!) and Marsala (which I doubled as well.  I will try Sherry next time to see if it enhances the flavor even more.  Oregano added a nice flavor as well & chopped fresh Italian Parsley perked up the color.  I served it over whole wheat pasta with baby frozen peas. Great meal!

This was excellent! The only thing I did differently was use all butter and no oil. It did wonders for the flavor. And it was easy enough to make on one of my busiest nights. My brother wasn't such a big fan, but that's his problem because I'll be making this often. Thanks so much for the recipe.

We enjoyed this.  It needed salt when I served it.  I did double the sauce as others suggested, added garlic, more mushrooms and onion.  Bacon would be great, just didnt have it on hand.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I did not have cooking sherry on hand so just did what other reviewers said and used all marsala.  It turned out great, but next time will try it will the sherry.

Excellent.  I used Sherry (not cooking Sherry) instead.  The only other change I made was to use a whole 8 ounce package of sliced mushrooms and I added a little bit of the left over flour to thicken the sauce and then seasoned with a little extra salt and pepper.  I loved it and will definitely make this again.

Wonderful recipe!  I made this last night for dinner and both my fiance and I loved it.  I followed suggestions made by others to cut the butter and oil slightly, added garlic powder to the flour mixture, and used chicken broth instead of the sherry.   This recipe is a keeper.

I wasn't too crazy about this one. It was very easy to make, but I could hardly taste the seasonings. I'll try this again with some help from the other users.

Excellent!  This was wonderfull!  The only thing I would do different next time is add a lot more mushroom.  Maybe about 3 cups.  Soooo yummy!  I had this for a dinner party, and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks

Best Marsala recipe I have ever made. I have made this many times. I double the sauce, but only use about 1/2 the oil and butter. I double the mushrooms. Sometimes I don't bread the chicken I just use it plane to cut down on time, it is awesome even without the breading. Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!

This was a very easy recipe.  I made a rue also after I cooked the chicken to make the sauce a little thicker.  Also added some shallots when I added the mushrooms in.  I pre-cooked the mushrooms too just because they were sooo big and I didnt think they would have cooked properly.  This is something that I will definately make again.  Even my kids liked it!  A keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was wonderful.  They only thing I did differently was add a little flour/water as it was simmering to thicken the sauce a little and make it go further.  Also, I doubled the amount of mushrooms and wine because you never seem to have enough sauce.

I liked this recipe but I like a different version I make better.  Mine calls for the addition of 2/3 cup of beef stock or broth.  This is in addition to the marsala wine (I don't use sherry in mine).  I know this sounds odd, but I think it makes the sauce alot more flavorful.  I also remove the browned chicken, then add the liquid, mushrooms and whisk in softened butter, adjust the taste, then add the chicken back as I reduce the liquid, and cover for a few minutes.

To give the sauce a little more flavor and thickness, try this.  When the chicken is browned and cooked through remove from the pan.  Do not add the mushrooms.  Turn the heat to high and add the marsala (I use all Marsala instead of sherry) and deglaze the pan, scraping up all the bits on the bottom.  Those bits are flour from the chicken and will help thicken the sauce.  Turn down the heat to medium, add the mushrooms and continue cooking until the sauce is thickened to your liking.  Add the chicken back to the pan and turn to coat.  You're done!

I tried this recipe when I was having 8 people over for dinner so I doubled it. There were no leftovers! Everyone loved it! It was very quick and easy. I accidently used self rising flour instead of all purpose and it still turned out great. Next time I will use the right flour and I know it will be even better! I also cut the chicken in small pieces. This is now a favorite in my household! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe goes off the charts in ratings.  If I could have given it a ten I would have.  My husband said this was even better than any of the restaurants that he has eaten it in and that the writer of this recipe is awesome!  It's a really quick and low cost meal.  Thanks so much. I will definately be making this again.

The flavor was good, but you could see the fat floating in the serving dish. Next time I will cut the oil and butter in half.

I thought it was just okay...The coating was tasty, but the chicken would have been better if it would have been sauteed until it was cooked rather than simmered. The simmering made the coating doughy, in a way I didn't like.

This was really good and SO easy to make.  I agree with others that it could use just a little more in the seasoning dept.  Some Italian seasoning or garlic powder would work nicely.  Next time, I will add a little cream at the end to make a creamier sauce and to cut down on the "tartness" of the wine and sherry.  My kids were not crazy about it.  I used 1-1/2 cups baby portobello mushrooms.  Delicious!

FINALLY!  Moist chicken breast with a ton of flavor to boot.  This recipie was sensational.  I used a few more mushrooms, but that is just because we love them so much.  It is so easy to make and takes no time at all.  Thank you!

This chicken marsala is quick and easy. I found that the sauce wasn't very thick so after taking the chicken out (when done) I had to boil it down a little with a 1/2 tsp. of corn starch. It was delicious!

Wow!  This was really easy and very delicious.I omitted the olive oil because I thought putting both olive oil and butter would be too much.  I also seasoned the chicken a little so that it would not be bland (garlic and onion powder, salt, and pepper).  I also threw in some minced garlic in the butter as the chicken cooked.  If you like mushrooms, I would put 2 cups intead of one.  I served this dish with mashed potatoes and leeks.  Overall, I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was almost to simple to make. The result was a resturaunt quailty chicken marsala that even my eight year old ate. It says it servers 4, but two aduts and an eight year old ate it all with no left-overs.

WOW! I can not believe that such a simple recipe can be SO good. I changed a few things:  I only used 2 chicken breasts and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Upon recommendations from others I added some crushed garlic and fresh parsley, it was delish!! I also used cooking spray instead of the oil and butter. This was my first time cooking marsala and I impressed myself with this recipe, thank you Lisa!

Fast, delicious, elegant and easy. I also doubled all the sauce ingredients including more mushrooms. I also added a few slices of fresh lemon in with the wine and allowed the flavors to blend. Fresh parsley garnish added a splash of last minute color. Great with linguine. Thanks, Lisa for a perfect recipe!AAAAA+++++

I have been searching for a chicken marsala recipe that would satisfy my husband and this may be it.  I think next time I will try this with baby portabellas and add some roasted garlic.  Terrific as is though.

This dish was tasty but pretty greasy.  I might suggest using less butter and maybe some chicken broth for added liquid.

I love this site sooooo much! It is definately recipes like this one that make a good cook. This recipe is definatly a keeper. I took suggestions of others halfing the butter and olive oil and adding alittle cornstarch and water to the mix to thicken up the sauce and served it over wide noodles.

Wow! I forgot to pound the chicken and it still turned out great, it just took longer to cook.  I will remember to do it next time, and there will definitly be a next time.

This is a quick recipe for a delicious weeknight dinner.  I don't like to pound chicken so I cut the boneless breasts in slices across the width into medallions.  For ease I put the flour mixtue into a plastic bag to coat the chicken pieces.  The chicken was moist and fork tender.  I added the entire 8oz package of sliced mushrooms.  We will be enjoying this again soon.  Thanks Lisa!

Yummy!  My husband actually said, "Umm" while eating it.  I used less butter & olive oil & 1/4 tsp oregano as my husband isn't a big oregano fan.  I didn't pound it to a 1/4 inch thickness but did pound it a bit.  I would double the sauce next time & use more mushrooms as everyone else recommended.

Very good and easy to make. Didn't have the cooking sherry so used just Marsala wine and it tasted great.

Oh my gosh!!!  This was SO easy and SO good, especially the mushrooms.  If you're a mushroom lover, add them in BIG chunks instead of slices and add MORE!  This is a restaurant quality recipe and I'll make it again when I want to impress someone!  It would be great served with egg noodles so you can use the sauce.

When I made this recipe the first time it turned out AWESOME. Just as good, if not better, than in a restaurant. When I made it again, I added more mushrooms and volume to have more marsala sauce. LOVE IT!!

Took a bold step and made this for the 1st time for a surprise birthday party. Despite making 20 servings, the preparation went quickly. I braised the chicken and mushrooms(yes...I added a lot more mushrooms) the night before. An hour before dinner, I added the dry Marsala and sherry, covered it tightly with foil and popped it into the oven. It was a HUGE success...everyone was so impressed! I found the reviews very, very helpful. I thought it was the BEST chicken marsala I've ever had...so did my guests.

I've made this dish about 4-5 times now and every time, it just gets better!  As with all the other reviews I use more marsala wine (we love sauce, so added 1.5 cups) and I also add 1 cup white wine.  The most important thing is to boil out the alcohol, leaving just the flavor of the wine.   This usually takes about 5-8 minutes.  I also add a dash of cream to thicken up the sauce and give it the taste you would get at a restaurant.  The chicken marsala tastes amazing with angel hair pasta. :)  Enjoy!

I've done this several times and have always enjoyed it BUT - two things need to be clarified.  Marsala comes in both a sweet and a dry.  Which to use?  Normally I use a combination of both. But the second is more important.  DO NOT USE COOKING SHERRY.   This is a cheap American "sherry" with a large dose of salt so that it is very unpleasant to drink.  Just use the Marsala, 3/4 cup.  I also normally reduce both the olive oil and the butter to cook the chicken.  In addition, if not using pre-sliced mushrooms, slice the mushrooms while the breasts get their first cooking.,

Ok I admit...I cheated...I made this even though I didnt have Marsala wine, against the advice of many reviewers...it just sounded too good not to try, and I was tired of finding great recipes only to realize I had about half the ingredients needed :)  The good news is that it was still delicious!  

I used a good Pinot Noir instead (yes I know its nothing like Marsala, but hey its what I was drinking at the time :p) and added a teaspoon of brown sugar after the sauce had reduced as the sauce needed it.  I did use the sherry and cooked most everything else as in the recipe, but with 50% less oil and butter, and adding a smidge of cornstarch/water to thicken the sauce at the end.  Served it with steamed potatoes and garlic asparagus.  Delicious!

It was a hit with the hungry peeps in the family (I've found that if don't feed them very often they just LOVE what I make!) and is going into rotation, I may even be really crazy and buy some Marsala wine next time...but then again maybe the Pinot made it even better!? ;o)

Totally agree with previous poster about adding a touch of cream, bringing it to a brief boil, and reducing it to make a cream sauce.  This transitioned the recipe from great to wow.  Otherwise it had a straight marsala wine taste.

I doubled the marsala and sherry being that I had 8 thinly sliced chicken breasts. After I simmered everything I took out the chicken and set aside the sauce and mushrooms and made a roux with 2 tablespoons of the leftover dredging mix and 4 tbs of butter.  Added the sauce back to the pan with the roux and whisked it all together adding some chicken broth. Added the chicken back to the pan to let it all come together. Made buttered noodles for a side and spooned the sauce over them....OMG DELISH!

Not bad at all! I followed the instructions as is. It was a tad bit bland to me so I added some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika then it tasted so much better. Don't be get scared by how liquidy it looks when you add the wine. I thought it was gonna come out bad but once it simmers for about 10 minutes or so you'll see how it thickens into gravy.

I made this recipe twice and it was very good.  The 2nd time I made it i used white wine.  I used the whole pkg of mushrooms, 8 or 10 oz.  After making it because we were not eating our dinner then I put them in a corning ware large dish.  Both recipes were delicious.  I didnt use the flour in the bag, I put it in a bowl and put the chicken in piece by piece to coat it with the oregano.  thanks

This recipe was SO flavorful and rich.  Not something I'd make every week since the fat/calories are pretty high but on special occasions, for sure!  I prepared the dish as directed with a few extra shrooms and a dash of cream to bulk up the sauce.  Hint: If you're using Sherry as directed, go with the "dry" Marsala.  The "sweet" Marsala will result in a very sweet end product.

This is one of our favorites. My husband loves it and can't wait to get home when he knows we're having it. Since I'm a sauce-aholic I always double the sauce. We are big mushroom fans so I always add a lot more mushrooms and slice up 1/4 of an onion. When I'm trying to be health conscious I use light butter and cut down on the olive oil a bit. However, when i'm doing it for company I use the full-fledged goodness of all the oil and butter.  It's become a standard in our kitchen.

Very tasty.  I just used 3/4 of a cup of marsala wine, I didn't have any cooking sherry, and it was just the cheap stuff from the grocery store since I don't drink wine.  I used about 2 pounds of chicken, which was 3 very large breasts and I cut them in half and pounded them down to get 6 good sized pieces. I'm not sure if the original recipe was for about a pound of chicken but I thought it didn't make very much sauce.  I added 1/2 a large onion, and sauteed the onion and mushrooms for a bit in the butter and I used garlic flavored olive oil.  Then added the chicken back in and poured the wine on top.  I think I could have easily doubled the sauce recipe, so if you are looking for a lot of sauce, I recommend doing that.  Thickening it with cornstarch or adding a little cream might have been good too.

Very good and simple.  I served with fettuccine, salad and roll.  For my taste, it needed more salt.  I took suggestions of others and increased mushrooms, thickened the sauce and added a touch of cream.  Definitely a keeper.

Super good and really easy recipe, looks so fancy and tastes so rich, but really it's a snap and goes together so easy. I will add more mushrooms next time. For the sake of cleanup I put the flour mixture in a plastic bag and shook the breasts to coat, so I could just throw the leavings away. I finished the sauce by adding a couple tablespoons of butter and it was decadent and delicious. Looks like you've cooked all day, but really it took no time at all.

This is my all time favorite chicken dish. I have made it several times and love it every time. I do double up on the mushrooms, Marsala wine and cooing sherry just to add a little more sauce. I also add garlic powder and simmer a little more than 10 minutes. Server over bow tie pasta tossed in olive oil, Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese. Absolutely love it!!

It was easy, quick & very tasty. I added chicken stock along with marsala wine. Added Italian seasoning, garlic, instead of oregano & no salt.  Left on stove for a couple of turns of the chicken then placed in the oven to bake on low heat. Made white jasmine rice to go with the chicken. Will make it again.

I love this recipe! I always double the sauce and add one cup of chicken broth. After it's done simmering I remove the chicken and most of the mushrooms and then thicken up the sauce with a cornstarch and water mix. The amount of cornstarch depends on your preference of consistency. I also double the seasoning in the flour coating for extra flavor on the chicken!

This was an amazing dish!  Simple yet delicious! I added one shallot and some garlic. I also added some corn starch at the end just to thicken the sauce slightly. I will be making this one again for sure!!!

After reading some of the reviews I followed their advice and put the seasonings and flour in a bag to coat the chicken.

Super delicious, quick & easy! I tweaked the recipe a bit. Shook pounded chicken breasts in a ziplock freezer bag with the flour, salt, pepper.. Added some paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning. After browning chicken in the butter/ oil, removed them & set aside. I then sautéed diced onion, red bell pepper& minced garlic with the mushrooms (used double the shrooms) Added 1.5 x the amounts of sherry & Marsala. Then replaced chicken to mix. Simmered low 10 minutes, turning chicken once more. Lastly, thickened the sauce with corn starch/ water combo. Served over rice. Wonderful flavor!

This was amazing!  I seasoned the chicken to my taste first then added flour.  When I sautéed the mushrooms added sweet onion and garlic. The sauce with mushrooms on the pasta and chicken was amazing!  Thanks for the recipe

My family did not like it at all. I used good real Marsala wine and Sherry. Very bland. The seasoning should be put in the sauce, not in the coating of the chicken (where almost none of it sticks). If you try this, definitely add more seasoning to the dish while cooking.

Oh, my Lord.  This was absolutely tremendous.  I've done about a dozen recipes on Allrecipes, and honestly I didn't have high hopes for this, but this was perhaps the best of them all.  I could eat this all the time.  Thank you so much for a terrific recipe.

This is my go-to recipe for chicken marsala.  Here are my adds:

1.  When I'm in a hurry (always!) I just slice the chicken horizontally across the breast for 1/4 - 3/8ths slices.  You get a lot of uniform slices out of a big breast.
2.  No sherry, increase the marsala.
3.  After removing the chicken from the pan, sautee mushrooms, add a couple tbs of butter and about a tbs of flour for a roux
3.  (For more sauce) I add about 1 - 1 1/2 cups chicken broth (increase the marsala to taste).
4.  Put chicken back in pan, sprinkle with about 1/3 cup chopped parsley.  
5.  Give it a squeeze of 1/4 - 1/2 a lemon.

We like it over spaghetti, sprinkled w/parmesan.  yum.

I had never made chicken marsala before.  It was so easy, and my Italian companion declared it "restaurant quality."  I made one small change:  I omitted the sherry and increased the marsala.

Excellent recipe for chicken in marsala wine sauce.  I did ammend the recipe slightly, according to the recommendations of other reviewers. I pounded and coated the chicken in a Ziploc bag.  I then lightly pan fried the chicken until cooked (omitting the butter and using less EVOO than called for, to cut fat), then removed from pan.  I proceed to brown some sliced onion via the water-method.  Once browned and evaporated, I added the wine and sherry, as well as 1 fresh garlic clove (crushed by a garlic press). I simmered until it started to cook down a bit.  I added (and tripled) the mushrooms and simmered until soft.  I continued to simmer with the objective of reaching a reduction,  but I grew impatient and just added a little slurry (cornstarch and water). Once the sauce thickened, I split the sauce into 2 portions and added a splash of heavy whipping cream to one portion (I recommend using VERY little,  or it will be too rich) and simmered a bit longer. While both delicious, of the two versions I yielded,  I preferred the marsala cream sauce.  Excellent recipe; I will use again and again!

This dish had good flavor. I added Vidalia onion. I use a 1 gallon bag for seasoned flour. I find that is easier for clean up, as well as shaking the coating on. Next time I will be adding some chicken stock for to stretch the sauce. paired it with angle hair pasta and yellow squash. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I love chicken marsala.  This sauce was so runny. I tried to thicken it which helped a little. I don't know why it has gotten so many positive reviews. Didn't care for it.

This was great!  I made as-is but eliminated the mushrooms because I wasn't sure my family would eat them.  I also put the flour mixture in a baggie and didn't have enough to coat all of the chicken so I ended up doubling that part of the recipe.  I added the chicken to the oil/butter too soon and my chicken ended up not brown enough and a bit soggy.  Make sure to wait until the oil/butter is hot enough.  I also pounded my chicken too thin and it just crumbled into pieces.  But with all of my personal short-comings, it was fantastic and tasted great!  I did add a bit of flour after I removed the chicken to thicken the sauce.  Next time I will not omit the mushrooms (my family said they missed them!) I will not pound so thin and I will make sure I add the chicken at the right time to the pan.  Even with how it turned out tonight I would put it up against any restaurant version.  Awesome recipe!!!

This was delicious. Lick your plate kind of good. I followed the loquid measurements for only 2 pieces of chicken and it was barely enough. I recommend doubling for 4 breasts. I also added onion amd garlic.  A must for this recipe and the main reason it didnt get 5/5. I used 1/2 onion cubed in chunks and about a tablespoon of minced garlic.Delicious.

I have made this twice now to RAVE "reviews" - It's easy, relatively inexpensive and REALLY GOOD! I sprinkled the chicken with some oregano BEFORE I coated it with the flour mixture and added a bit of chicken broth to the wine and it did make a difference! I will be making this AGAIN!

I tried this last week and I loved the fact that this was a stove top supper I followed the advice on buying a good marsala, and I served it over a chicken broccoli pre-made pasta dish, no one was the wiser.  Kichen stayed cool and clean up was a snap!

AWESOME!!! Hubby's top 5 favorite! I did follow some of the suggestions such as adding sliced garlic, chopped onion, and I used all Marsala wine. I also cut the butter and oil in half and it worked just fine! Only other tweak I need to make is increasing that amazing sauce! I served this over mashed potatoes.
Just a note for those looking for Marsala wine (not the cooking kind). I think most grocery stores carry the cooking wine in the oil/vinegar section of the store but this is simply not the same as the drinking Marsala wine. Let me tell you I was about to give up the search for the real stuff but I'm so glad I didn't! As is the case in my state (SC), if you are having a hard time  finding the 'real' Marsala wine then look at places where hard liquor is sold. I was told that this wine has more alcohol than typical wine and the store needs to have a liquor licence. I'm guessing this is accurate based on my search results!!

Oh hot dayyyyyyum we have a new favorite in the house! I followed the recommendations and floured and browned my chicken breast and then kept them warm in the oven at 250 degrees, I just didn't have enough room in my pan. THEN I made the sauce... I doubled/tripled the sauce ingredients for the sauce and added in cornstarch with chicken broth to thicken it. Using REAL Marsala wine is the trick and not the cooking Marsala stuff. Lastly, instead of submerging the chicken back in the sauce I just poured the sauce over it. Served it with the Pasta e Olio (also on this site) with broccoli and it was outstanding!!!! One last note I have on it...depending on the size of your pan and your approach (such as mine) it did NOT take 30 mins to make, more like 60 since we had large chicken breasts that were pounded out and I could only do one breast at a time....just a heads up. May even try this with chicken tenders next time for quick mixing.

I love this recipe. It's an easy, elegant way to do chicken. I precisely had been  following this recipe. However, I now have made the following tweaks.

1. Brown both sides of the chicken, then remove from pan. (My experience with this recipe indicates that the leaner chicken breasts dry out.)
2. Substitute dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrated according to package directions. Add the mushrooms to the pan & stir occasionally until browner.
3. Combine the marsala & the sherry. To that mixture, add about 1 teaspoon fresh oregano or 1/2 teaspoon dried. Pour over the mushrooms.
4. Return the chicken to the pan. Simmer for 3 minutes then turn over & simmer for an additional 3 minutes or until juices run clear.
5. Whisk in remaining butter, allowing sauce to thicken. Then season to taste with salt and pepper. 
6. Serve with preferred side dish. (It goes very well with Easy Rice Pilaf.)

My family loved the shiitake mushrooms over the button I had been using because of the stronger flavor imparted to the sauce.

Rather than pound the chicken to a uniform thickness, I slice the chicken through the center of the breast to produce cutlets. I suppose this step is similar to butterflying the breast.

A home run on the 1st try!  Chicken Marsala is one of my wife's favorite dinner out dishes.  No more!  This was new king on the first try.  I did only do two breasts and added garlic and green onion per other suggestions and made full sauce/mushroom load.  Served with pasta for me and rice for her...

Absolutely loved this recipe. I did cut the butter and oil in half and added about 1/3 cup diced onion and 3 minced garlic cloves with the mushrooms. After the sauce thickened a bit I added some heavy cream which made the sauce delightful and went well on the angel hair pasta. I removed the meat after browning and did not put it back in until the sauce was done

Once again allrecipes  comes though with a great dish.  1st time followed it exactly.  Second time I Used all Marsala wine and added a little chopped onion and minced garlic when sautéing the mushrooms. Love adding a little cream at the end.   Absolutely delicious and easy.  As good or better than I've had in a restuarant.

I tried this recipe almost exactly as described, with the addition of some minced garlic and chopped green onion for color.  The chicken was gorgeous - golden brown and very tasty.  I agree with some of the others, that it needed additional seasoning.  I added a bit of salt and some lemon pepper.  I will definitely double or triple the sauce and mushrooms next time - both were highlights in this lovely dish and you need them to flavor the pasta.  We really enjoyed it!

Very good! Never had chicken Marsala let alone made it, but it turned out wonderful. Didn't cook it all the way over the stove I had very thick chicken breasts so i finished in the oven at 375 for 20 mins. Still wasn't quite done baked for another 10 and it was perfect! I also should mention I cooked it in an iron skillet!

So Yummy!!!!!  I followed other peoples recommendations and added double the mushrooms (I'd triple the amount of mushrooms next time).  Added a full 3/4 cup of Marsala, about 1/4 of sherry and added some half/half and corn starch to thicken it up and make it more creamy.  A family fav from now on!!

I have made this dish several times and have gotten rave reviews each time. It's definitely a keeper. I believe the recipe is perfect as is. Only thing I did different was add more of the wines for more sauce. Delicious! If you're thinking about using this recipe, definitely do! :)

I followed the recipe exactly like it stated and it was very bland. The chicken was moist but not enough flavor. The only thing I can think that was slightly different was the Marsala wine. I bought the Marsala cooking wine and not regular wine? Not sure if that alters the flavor. I used the leftovers for chicken tacos the next day and the chicken was still very moist.

love this dish, made to a tee except my rule of thumb (the cookherrie) never use anything that you would not drink out of a glass, cooking sherry, it is horrible as a drink, so use real sherry, or marsala, and your dish will taste much better, ask any chef, they will tell yu the same, wih they would take cooking sherry off the shelves, it's awful, well to me it is, all you cooking sherry lovers to each his own, love ya all!

The entire family enjoyed this recipe. We put it over angel hair pasta. Next time I will double the ingredients so I can have some extra sauce to put over everything. Great recipe.

I too used only marsala no sherry. Try using parm cheese in the flour mix. I also pan fried the chicken served on top of the mashed red potatoes and served the sauce around the chicken and potatoes. Beautiful presentation. Add sun dried tomotoes and your mouth just says WOW!

Awesome!!!! Didn't change anything, I really wish people would post new recipes when they want to "change just a few things". My picky husband said it tasted just like olive garden.

This was very quick, easy, and very tasty!  I would absolutely make it again.  Followed the suggestions of others to double the liquids -- and I might seriously consider tripling them next time I make it.  I cut the olive oil and butter by about a third and didn't miss it.  Added a finely diced half a red onion, a tablespoon of minced garlic (possibly a little too much -- might reduce that in the future), a little bit of thyme and tarragon, and used dry sherry instead of cooking sherry.  Sauce was thicker than traditional marsala but was tremendously flavorful and luscious.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was awesome. I served with whole grain linguine noodles, garlic breadsticks and a caesar salad, and red wine. Soooo good!!! I probably would omit breading the chicken next time though. Being that it's a flour coating, it got soggy after pouring the marsala & sherry in. Not to where it was gross or anything but I think the breading was sort of unnecessary.

yes, I've made it several times; however, 1 time I didn't have chicken but pork tenderloin; made it exactly the same, and my husband hasn't stopped talking about it. The pork made the dish a little richer and more flavorful.  I added onions as I simply cannot cook without them, but do not recommend using garlic as I found in one recipe.  And didn't add sherry; didn't have it; used marsala completely.  I will always use chicken, but will continue to use pork.   MMMMMMM!

I really liked this recipe and it was easy to prepare in advance.  I used cooking Sherry and Marsala Wine which I had in my cupboard.  I doubled the sauce and mushrooms, adding 1/4 cup of stock, 1/4 Half & Half and some cornstarch to thicken.  I used less salt, used Italian Seasoning instead of Oregano (didn't have any).  
I browned the chicken lightly, placed in casserole dish with the sauce and refrigerated for several hours. Cooked in covered dish in oven at 350F for 40 minutes. Then switched oven off until ready to serve - with rice and green beans.

Always looking for something different we tried this. Not very knowledgeable about wines we used "Sweet Red Bella Bolle'" which we had on hand, also didn't have cooking sherry just upped the amount of Bella. Don't know how much this differs from a marsala, but it doesn't matter, this dish was wonderful. I feel certain that the substitution changed the flavor but really appreciate this posting. Would never have attempted making this without the guide of this recipe. Will certainly make this again. Thank you so much!

great recipe! easy and great way to reinvent chiken. 
I left it an extra 10 minutes on the skillet with the cover on and fire off. It helps infuse the chiken with taste.
I added more mushrooms and dind't use sherry. I was asked to make this at home at least twice a month!

5 stars with my changes. I made as written first and the sauce was too thin without enough flavor for us. Next time I used ALL marsala wine (no sherry) and added balsamic vinegar to the sauce and thickened the sauce with a cornstarch and milk mixture. I will add more spices to the flour mixture next time as well for more flavor.

I made this for supper tonight and I thought is was ok. The rest of my family liked it just fine.  I added extra spices to the flour and half and half to the wine sauce. The best part I want to talk about is  pounding the chicken to 1/4".  I had read/heard a hint somewhere to save the waxed paper bag from the empty cereal box to use for cooking.  I thought that was a good way to get bugs in the cabinets here at home.  We emptied a box of cereal this morning so I used it as the pounding container for 6 chicken breast halves.  It worked amazingly well.  I pounded 2 at a time and it held through all 6. The best part was the clean-up.  So easy and not messy at all.  Give it a try - you'll be glad you did.

This was really easy and came out very tasty. As with any dish that has a gravy or sauce, I doubled so we would have enough to cover the pasta. One kid thought it was too sweet, another thought it had too many mushrooms. Keep in mind they have never had chicken marsala before though. Could it be fancier, take more time and come out more restaurant quality? Sure, but who has time for that on a weekday?

This was very tasty but definitely needed to cut down on the fat content. Used 2 tbsp coconut oil to saute the chicken then when all was done and simmering, added in a 1/2 tbsp butter to cream it up a bit. The coconut oil added great flavor.

This and a garlic bread recipe are the only recipes I considered reviewing because I love them so much. I enjoy many wine-based dishes, however, so that could contribute to my affinity to this chicken marsala. I always try to follow recipes to the T the first time because I only think it's fair to do so, and the chicken marsala came out splendid! The only thing I changed was the fat content: 3 tbs butter +1 tbs oil. I am very glad I did because it tasted fantastic while being lower in fat, despite the sauce content being less then it otherwise wouldn't have been. So yea, I don't know how anyone could dislike this recipe, and it definitely deserves all the high reviews it has garnered. Will cook again and again!

We really liked this recipe.  I tweaked it by using less than half the butter and removing the chicken from the pan after browning and adding some minced garlic to sautee with the mushrooms for a bit before deglazing the pan with the sherry and marsala, then adding the chicken back in and covering.  I also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I also didn't use "good" marsala or sherry (couldn't find it in my grocery store and didn't have a lot of time to hunt) just the cooking stuff from the grocery store and it still turned out delicious for how simple it was to make.  Husband requested this be added into the regular dinner rotation.

This was delicious!! I realized when I went to make it that I didn't have any sherry on hand, so I substituted apple cider for the sherry. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I used baby bella mushrooms and put everything over a bed of spaghetti, Mmmmm!!

Delicious.  I did add just a touch of heavy cream to the sauce to make it a little richer, but aside from that, stayed true to the recipe as written.  Will be making it again.

I order chicken marsala when we eat out. I've always wanted to try this at home. Recipe was easy too follow and turned out better than I expected. (Didn't make any changes to the recipe.) My 85 year old mother-in-law had two servings. Definitely recommended.

Didn't even use the marsala wine, subbed in mirin (sweetend saki cooking wine), and I threw in some squash and zucchini with big portobellos cut into strips, served it over rice.  Might be the first time I didn't have to tack another 20 minutes to prep time.  Served it over rice.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because it definitely requires a few changes to make it really good. More mushrooms are a must! I followed the suggestion to brown the chicken breasts, them remove them and sauté some garlic and onions, then deglaze the pan with the wine before putting the chicken and mushrooms in it. It works out really well that way. At the end, I add some milk (instead of cream) to the pan to make the sauce creamy, and to make more sauce. I find there isn't much left at the end. Adding milk makes it a nice sauce to put over pasta, and keeps it fairly low fat. We love it!

I am 14 years old and this was sooo easy to make! My mom said what we were having and she gave me the recipe and I just went to work.  It was really easy to make and everyone had seconds! I was very, very good!

I'm giving this five stars because it is such a classic, no-fail recipe. Don't bother making this in advance if you are serving company -- the mushrooms are best if just cooked right before serving so that they have the right firmness. Very yummy! Best served with white wine -- because of the cooking sherry and marsala wine as ingredients I find you need something a little lighter than red wine to pair it with.

This was very easy to cook! Everyone in my family loved it! I took a few suggestion from the other reviews by omitting the cooking sherry. Adding heavy cream, butter and minced garlic instead. This was so delicious!

OMG I can't believe how good this was. My family devoured it. I did add 1/2 c of sour cream and 1 cup of water plus 1 tsp of chicken better than bouillon. I served it with angel hair pasta that had olive oil and fresh basil in it.

I said to my husband "o.k. I'm going to cook now" he said "no that is going to take too long lets have sandwiches" I said " no its not going to take long" 30 min. later he was eating a hot delicious meal. He could not believe how fast I cooked this chicken and he went on and on about how much he loved it and to add it to my recipes. I add a little garlic and salt. MUST COOK its yummy

Such an easy recipe to follow and made quite the impression on a first date! Used Perdue chicken cutlets (8 small cutlets). Pouring over egg noodles with a dash of grated romano cheese is the perfect combination.

This recipe has become a staple in my household. Super easy and tastes great! I typically brown the chicken in a skillet and then transfer to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes at 375 degrees while I make the marsala sauce. I like to add onions and garlic to this recipe and serve it with mashed potatoes.

I always sautee crushed or minced garlic in olive oil before adding the chicken, because it seems to give it more flavor.  I double the sauce and pair it with homemade mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. I like what someone said about avoiding cooking wines - it's true.  If they are not good enough to drink, they are not good enough to cook with.  Haven't found a need to add heavy cream and chicken broth to make it creamier, but it sounds good.  Excellent recipe that is both easy to make and fairly tasty.  Thanks!

Pounded chicken in a large gallon sized ziplock bag, placed the flour, spices and mixed those together in a small sandwich bag. Dipped the chicken in milk and placed back into gallon sized bag then poured the flour and seasoning mixture. After coating all the piece I then added them to he olive oil and butter in th pan. In addition to the sherry and sweet Marsala (I find the dry makes it too bitter), I also added 1/2 can chicken stock. This was soupy but delicious over noodles. Next time I may try cornstarch to thicken it.

This is the most simple and delicious chicken Marsala recipe! I didn't have cooking sherry so I used white wine, besides that I followed the recipe to a t and its my favorite one that I have made now. (Of course the olive gardens is the best) but for a quick meal I have no complaints! Thank you for this recipe!

I've never done a rating for anything, but i had to for this.  All i can say is:  "Delicious.....deliciously delicious!!!"
I received an Oscar last night for this meal.  I substituted 3/4 sweet Marsala instead of using the sherry.
The chicken was soooo tender, they used butter knives.  I served this with potatoe au gratin.  Thank you to all my little people (my kids).

Excellent recipe. 
I made it exactly as written and we were not disappointed. Next time I might try adding onions and/or garlic as other reviewers suggested. I have tried several times to make chicken marsala and none have turned out tasting like what you have in a better restaurant as this did.
Thanks for the post.

I’m puzzled by what must be very small chicken breasts used here. I have a huge wide pan and even then I couldn’t get 4 breasts side by side in it. We’re having it for dinner tonight. I’m sure it will taste fine, but the breasts I used (from free-range chickens) will feed three of us twice I expect.

Great recipe for chicken marsala. We both hate mushrooms, so I prepared the recipe without them. I used thin-sliced chicken breasts, as well as a combination of 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth. I removed the chicken from the pan after browning, then added 2-3 T of leftover dredging flour to the butter-oil in the pan, cooked for a minute or 2, then added the marsala and boiled to thicken slightly before returning the chicken to the pan. Gave a nice body to the finished sauce! Garnished with freshly chopped Italian parsley before serving.

This recipe is very simple to follow and turns out being delicious. I made a couple modifications- Instead of pounding out the chicken cutlets, I cut them up into 1" cubes and only used 3 tablespoons of a vegetable oil/butter blend. I do not use any form of "cooking" wine anymore because it is salty garbage and you can get a decent-sized bottle of regular dry sherry for around 5 or 6 dollars. Since I only very lightly coated the chicken pieces with the flour mixture, I added a bit more oregano, salt and pepper to the sauce when it was almost done.

I made this for the first time tonight. It was very good, I added onions with the mushrooms, and garlic powder to my flour mixture. I've had chicken marsala before and the chicken was so tender. I do question if my chicken needed to be pounded a bit more.

This is just a personal opinion, but I thought that the marsala was overpowering. It is probably supposed to be prominent, but I didn't really enjoy it. There were only two marsala bottles at the store and they were both the same price so I'm not sure if I just got an unpleasant bottle?! I don't think I'll be trying this again. :(

The best chicken marsala I've made so far.  I have made it with the sherry and w/o.  Either way it's delish!  I also add a little extra butter to the sauce while it's cooking to help it thicken up and add some creaminess.

I cut the butter (used I can't believe it's not butter light) and Olive oil to 3 tablespoons each since I was making only 2 large chicken breasts but kept the liquid the same and used a bit more mushrooms,.  I did not have sherry so I made up the difference with low sodium chicken broth and marsala wine.  I did use the seasoned flour on the chicken before cooking unlike some reviewers.  The sauce thickened wonderfully and the mushrooms were excellent - wish I had added more of them.  Something was missing though and will definitely have the sherry when we have this again.  Gave this 5 stars instead of 4 because I feel the missing ingredient might have been the sherry and it was super easy to prepare.  Next time I will cut the fat even more and try increasing the liquid becuase the sauce was so tasty on garlic and basil noodles.

I made this for my family last night.  I'm not a big cook, but this was quick and easy, and everyone loved it!  I forgot to pound the chicken before cooking, but they turned out fine anyway.  Just had to cook them a little longer.  Will definitely cook this again!

This was a delicious and easy to make recipe. It tasted just as good, if not better, than the chicken marsala that I remembered from a restaraunt that I used to always order from. I didn't have cooking sherry so I used all Marsala wine as someone suggested in an earlier review; didn't miss it because it was still awesome. I also fried a few slices of bacon I had left in the fridge in the pan with the butter and olive oil for an extra flavor kick. The chicken had a wonderful coating from the flour and the sauce was delicious. Thanks Lisa for the great recipe!

I make Prime Rib for our annual Christmas Eve dinner but I have 3 in the family that don't eat beef so I was looking for an easy Chicken dish. I am so glad I found this one. It was the hit of the party even some of the biggest meat eaters ate just as much of this as the beef. I did use canned muchrooms because it was what I had  Two of the guests have already asked for the recipe. Thank you for such a fabulous easy dish.

One thing about this site that I dislike is when reviewers give 4 or 5 stars based on the way they doctor up the original recipe. Its very misleading. But anyway, good base, but this came out super bland. I even added a little cream, but it was lacking flavor! Maybe next time I'll add some chicken broth as another reviewer suggested.

This was some seriously good chicken!  It took about 30 minutes from start to table -- including making a salad and some pasta to serve it over making this a real god-send for weeknight weary chefs.  Not crazy expensive to make and the flavors not outrageous enough to freak out anybody.  I did add garlic just cause and one shallot to the mushrooms and it did bump it up a little.  Good comfort food that's easy enough for the most basic cook, too.

This is so simple and delicious. The sauce needs to be thickened with a couple of teaspoons of flour. I served over spaghetti and used cremni mushrooms.

This was really good except a little too greasy and I only used 3 tablespoons of butter and oil. Next time I will definitely cut back even more. I also added more mushrooms, and will add even more next time. The mushrooms really add to the dish!

Made for dinner after long day at work last night. Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was missing something. I did what other reviewers suggested and added some cream and chicken broth. But it was bland. I think it needs more salt and maybe garlic powder. I also chopped up about 5 garlic cloves and added that right at the end of cooking time because we are huge garlic fanatics. That boosted the flavor. But it was still bland. The dish itself smelled amazing though and we did use dry marsala wine as opposed to sweet since this recipe didn't specify. It was quick and easy. Will add more salt next time and maybe even some green beans and potatoes!!! YUM!

Great Marsala recipe. I like to make dishes as healthy as possible so I made a few adjustments: 1. I grilled the chicken instead of pan frying and then added into mixture as it simmered to absorb some of the flavor. 2. I didn't add any butter, just extra virgin olive oil. 3. I also added some garlic to the mushroom mix for extra flavor. Served with whole wheat bow-tie pasta and asparagus. Chicken Marsala is my boyfriend's favorite and he loved this!

Really good recipe!  I followed directions exactly, except doubled the mushrooms.  Paired it with a side of rice pilaf & fresh asparagus and it was a huge hit.  Simple enough for a weeknight, and still delicious.

I thought this was good. I would use good Marsala- if you don't I would agree with other viewers it would not be as good. I added some garlic cloves to the sauce and simmered along with the mushrooms. I removed the chicken while doing this. It was wasy to make and will make it again. Thanks for sharing.

We loved this recipe! I added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the flour mixture and cooked it in olive oil then removed it from the pan. Added chopped onion with the mushrooms and doubled the liquid, cooked it down a little then put the chicken back in and let it cook another few minutes. I didn't have marsala so I used Zinfandel and it was a great substitute! Also used Thyme instead of oregano (not a big fan) and thought it added a great flavor. I thickened it with a water/cornstarch mixture. In the "keep" pile!

Be sure to pound the chicken out. Making double the sauce is a great idea. The more mushrooms, the merrier! Add minced garlic. And add a cup of chicken broth and thicken sauce with half a tsp of flour. Serve with garlic mashed potatos. Honestly, a TOTALLY AWESOME DINNER!!!
**Easily reheats

Better than the chicken marsala I've had at most Italian restaurants. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Girlfriend is out of town, so I am cooking for one and this was a great meal. Easy to do. Instead of 1 tbsp of sherry and 2 tbsp of marsala, I used 3 tablespoons of sherry and the flavor was still great. Just a money saving suggestion.

This was so easy and excellent....I changed it a little added more mushrooms and doubled the Sherry and wine.  I also added crushed garlic to the melted butter before i started cooking the chicken. To make the sauce a little thicker I added corn starch/water about 3 tables spoon of the mixture.  It was by far the best I have ever tasted....Thank you Lisa

Great made for company last week! Bit hit. I dissolved approx 2 T. corn starch in 1/2 half and half and added it toward the end to thicken sauce and make creamier. Simmered dish for approx 1 hour.

I made this last night as is with some Wild rice as a side dish and it got rave reviews by the family!  I think next time I'll double or triple the sauce and amount of mushrooms so there's more so I can use it as a gravy and every gets more mushrooms, but this is really great as is!

I made this for guests and they thought it tasted like restaurant quality. I took suggestions from some of the reviews and doubled the wines and mushrooms. I added a little cream at the end to thicken the sauce and simply added some dry basil to the flour to give it some color and flavor. It really WAS like restaurant quality!

If I could have made it 6 stars I would.  I changed nothing!  Made it just the way it's shown and it was a big winner in my house.  I could have easily eaten way too much.  The gravy is outstanding with the Marsala and Sherry.  Congrats to you Lisa!!

This was really delicious!  It was full of flavor and my 5 year old devoured it!  At the end of cooking, it had a lot more juice than I had expected, but that was probably due to me using more mushrooms than it called for.  The extra juice went really well with the "Quinoa Side Dish" we found off of this site.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have cooking sherry the 1st time so increased
marsala. Great!  Next time tried it with the sherry. 
Preferred it with the marsala only.

didn't have any mushrooms and used a red wine that i already had instead of marsala.  added chicken stock instead of sherry and added cream for a creamy and savory sauce.  ate with a side of noodles.  will definitely make again.

ABSOLUTELY a favorite in this house! The chicken comes out sooooo moist & tender! The first night I made it everyone wanted it the next night too. Ofcourse we didn't have it the next night, but I do try to 1x a week, I did incorporate some of the suggestions by other reviews to improve flavor.

This dish was absolutely fantastic. The only things I 'modified' was I left out the mushrooms (for my hubby) and dumped the rest of the flour from covering the chicken breasts into the skillet to thicken the sauce. I can't believe it was so easy and simple yet tasted so good. I used $1.50 cooking wines and it was still wonderful. This will become a staple for week night meals.

Hubby had suggested Chicken Marlsala for dinner so I knew I could count on allrecipes to give me a good one. This recipe was was easy and quick to prepare .. I had to make a couple of small changes only because I didn't have 2 ingredients on hand. One I used all purpose whole wheat flour instead of white flour and basil instead of oregano. Sense I had only two chicken breast, I split them in half length wise and pounded them thin  .. As with several other reviews I doubled the recipe for the sauce. I also removed chicken from sauce and added whole wheat pasta to the mix tossing lightly with tongs .. Served with tossed green salad and small glass of the marsala wine to go with :)

I made this last night & it tastes great!, I made few changes because I'm a muslim and can't have wine so I used chicken broth also I did what one of the reviewer suggested of removing the chicken after browning and add mashroom and milk- didn't have cream - to make the sauce and put the chicken back & served it over garlic & baisl fettucine the result was YmmOhhh!

WOW!!   that about sums this one up. 
the only changes I made were I exchanged sherry for chardonnay because I  didn't have any sherry in the house . My husbands eyebrows rose high on the first bite and I had to fight him off from taking seconds so that we could have enough for a second meal. This one instantly goes onto my personal top ten!

I browned the chicken for 4 minutes each side and transfered to another dish. Carmelize the mushrooms in the same pan and add a chopped shallot and olive oil if needed. Then add the sherry and marsala and reduce, then return the chicken to the pan and simmer for 5 minutes coating the juices on both sides of chicken. Let sit 5 min. before serving.

DeeeLish!!! I did make a few changes after reading the reviews.  I left out the cooking sherry- just used some chicken stock and extra marsala. Also, after cooking the chicken I sauteed an onion and some minced garlic. Then added a pinch of oregano, double the mushrooms (Baby Bellas), S&P. Made the sauce - added the chicken back in for just a few minutes - served over pasta. Really great! I was proud to serve this to my family!

I made egg and milk mixture to dip chicken into first.  I cooked all chicken and removed, added a 1/2 c of wine, and chopped up mushrooms, then added a touch of wondra flour to thicken for gravy.  Served on top of mashed potatoe with asparagus.

Excellent!!  We modified just a bit by sauteing a few diced shallots in the butter before adding the chicken.  We also wanted to have more than enough sauce for our pasta too, so we doubled the wet ingredients (3/4 cup Marsala, 1/4 red cooking wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth) then we thickened it in the end with a little bit of corn starch.  Super tasty!!

Very good recipe that can be easily converted to make a non-dairy meal. Definitely double the sauce if you plan to serve it over pasta.  The sauce is great "runny" or thick.

This was a great recipe! I followed the whole recipe to the tee, and it turned out perfect! I'm not a big fan of chicken breasts because they always turn out dry and flavorless, but this chicken was flavored perfectly, and came out very tender. The inlaws LOVED it and we did not have any leftovers! I will definitely make this again!

Over all I feel that the taste of the sauce was exactly what I was looking for. I used to work at an italian restaurant who served the best marsala ever, so i have that to gauge it up to. The only downfall is the thickness of the sauce. I wanted to serve it over noodles but the sauce seemed so thin and brothy that I really wanted it to be thicker. I am not sure what I can use as a thickening agent to not loose the flavor of the sauce. Any ideas.


FYI-I learned from the restaurant that you have to use DRY marsala wine (good quality) and good Sherry. that is what makes the sauce after all. A good quality marsala and sherry wont run you up more than $15 bucks at the liquor store.

Very flavorful, but like others, after reading the reviews I made minor adjustments.  In the sauce I also used scallions, cream of chicken soup, and a splash of chicken broth.  Instead of serving over angel hair, I served it with garlic smashed potatoes.

This was awesome!  I more than doubled the sauce and it was just enough, in my opinion.  I also added a tad of chicken broth a little light whipping cream and some extra flour to thicken it a bit.  I used only dry Marsala wine and it tasted a touch too boozy.  Next time I'll use sherry too.  Everyone said they loved it and 2 of my girlfriends are Marsala experts, so that says something!

My family loved this recipe!  I used my crockpot to finish cooking the chicken after I breaded and browned it.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours with a 1/2 c of marsala wine. Two hours before I wanted to serve it, I made the mushroom sauce using whipping cream instead of the sherry and pouring it over the chicken in the crockpot.  It was AMAZING!  The chicken was so moist and the sauce was rich and flavorful.  I will definitely make it again!  Even my picky eaters ate this well.

I only gave this three stars because it basically required a total overhaul to get it to taste like the stuff you get in the restaurant. I tripled the recipe for the sauce (1 and 1/2 cups marsala plus 1/4 cup sherry) so it could be served over pasta by itself, without a side of pasta marinara. However, this came out with a very strong alcohol taste when I just followed the recipe. That's not the way this dish should taste. So I had to add quite a bit of chicken stock plus better than bouillon refrigerated chicken stock paste to give it more chicken flavor, swapped basil for the oregano, added approx two tablespoons of brown sugar and an extra tablespoon of butter plus about 1/4 cup heavy cream and a slurry made from mixing 2TBS corn starch to approx 4TBS chicken stock to thicken it. Oh -- and I sauteed a shallot and added that. I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand so I used three cans of organic sliced mushrooms. After ALL that, I had a smooth, creamy, only slightly sweet & buttery sauce like the stuff you get in restaurants. So basically this was my own recipe just inspired by Lisa's. The sauce was good enough and thick enough to spoon over linguine.

Good recipe but I would add 2 cups of Fresh Mushrooms.  I also bought a Mushroom Gravy and added it at the end it covered the noodles better that way.

Fantastic!  Quick and Easy.  I added minced garlic when browning the chicken, doubled the wine and sherry and added cornstarch/water mixture to thicken the sauce a little just before serving.  My picky boys ate every bite!  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at Chicken Marsala. I found this recipe to be very quick and easy.  I made two slight changes, I cut the amount of butter and olive oil in half and used 3/4 cup of Marsala wine.  The absence of the butter and oil did not seem to adversely affect the flavor. I paired with whole wheat linguine and garlic bread.  Will definitely make this again!

Very easy to make.  Seemed a bit bland, so next time, I will double the mushrooms, add garlic, and perhaps increase the wine as other reviewers have suggested.

I followed the recipe exactly as it's written.  The chicken was very tender, but the sauce had an unusual taste.  That could be because I'm not used to cooking with wine.  Not sure, but it turned out just okay.  I did like how quick and easy it was, but  I wouldn't make it again.

Very tasty. I did not use sherry and used a cup of marsala wine. I think I needed to cut back to 3/4 Cup. I doubled the mushrooms too! Yummy over linguini.

My husband and I are on a special diet where we eat lots of vegetables and a little meat--very few carbs.  This recipe fit the diet, tasted very good and was a nice change from plain chicken. I put the chicken pieces in a Ziploc bag with flour and salt to coat.  Worked well.  It was fast to make, didn't take long at all.  Would certainly make again.

I make a very similar version of this recipe. I flour the chicken without the oregano. Then I lightly brown the chicken, set it aside, sauté garlic cloves, then add the mushrooms and sauté the mushrooms. To the mushrooms I add about a cup of Marsala. I reduce the wine by half add about a cup of cream, return the chicken back to the pan and warm. Serve with rice.

This is very good AS IS! Because I am lazy, I use the chicken tenderloin pieces. They cook in less time and are tender.  I add fresh minced garlic in with the butter and oil. Other than that, I don't alter this recipe at all...

DH does not usually care for Italian and he always has the Chicken Marsala at our favorite restaurant and he said this is even better! I did sub chicken stock for the sherry since the marsala really brings out the flavor anyway and double the mushrooms & sauce (the best part).  It's a great "non-tomato based" italian dish and serve over angel-hair pasta with garlic bread & salad...Wonderful!

I put twenty whole peeled cloves of garlic in a large pan with 1/4 cup EVOO on medium heat. I browned the cloves but before they carmelized I moved them to one side of the pan and added the pounded chicken breasts. When the breasts were added I piled the garlic all over & around the meat.  When the breasts were done I placed them in a pan aside and made the sauce which I also doubled. Adding a little half and half and chicken stock then reducing down until it was the consistancy of cake batter then I added the meat back into the sauce. Quick easy, and wonderful! Chicken Marsala Masoero  mangiare!

I made a few changes, and everyone LOVED it.  Before browning the chicken, I saute'd 1 cup sliced carrots til slightly crisp, along with a few minced cloves of garlic in a little olive oil.  Then I add the sliced mushrooms to cook a moment. Proceed with the recipe as specified, adding some heavy cream and chicken broth to the sauce.  Mix in a little flour to cold chicken broth for thickening the sauce more.  Also, adding 1/2# of cleaned shrimp to the chicken after it is almost cooked thru is a delicious complement to the taste.  Cook til shrimp is just pink and done.  Garnish with fresh lemon slices and fresh parsley sprigs.  Definitely great for serving to company!

This was fabulous! I followed the recipe pretty much as is, but took the advice of one reviewer and used cornstarch and heavy cream to thicken the sauce. Despite having to scramble at the last minute to unthaw frozen breasts in order to double the recipe for last minute dinner guests it was  a big hit. I served it with angle hair pasta, salad and french bread.

This was fantastic.  There weren't any leftovers after I made this.  I think the biggest changes I made were to add some garlic powder to the flour dip and I didn't use any butter and only 3T of olive oil.  4T of each is WAY to much I think.  Ii also doubled the sauce like some other reviewers recommended.  I also used a little extra marsala wine just to taste.  Overall it is a definite keeper.

Loved this - after I browned the chicken, I put in a 350-degree oven with some of the marsala and covered with foil while I made the sauce.  I doubled the sauce and used all marsala (no sherry).  Also added flour to the sauce at the end to thicken.  Served w/ angel hair.

Thank you, this is a favorite to serve for guests, they always ask for the recipie.  And I love the fact that it is so quick to make!

I give this recipe (my altered version) a full out 5 stars simply because I can't give it more!  I've made this so many times now that I don't even look anymore at the recipe. I use sweet cream sherry instead of cooking sherry.. I saute some red onions and garlic in butter, finely chop a couple of the total mushrooms and add those while the sauce is thickening (added flavor) add in a dash of lime juice and some heavy whipping cream to make it heavenly.  I also use chicken breast tenderloins and cut them into strips, rather than full breasts and do not use the flour.  When the pasta is done, I add in a dash of olive oil and a touch of lemon juice straight to the pasta.   This version makes a thicker creamier sauce and has enough zing to balance out the sweetness without overpowering the natural chicken and mushroom flavorings.  The wine is easy to balance out, no matter how much sauce you need. Use twice as much marsala as you do sherry. So if you need to use 2 cups of marsala, use 1 cup sherry, etc.   AWESOME AWESOME recipe!!  THANK YOU!!

This is the first time that i have been so compelled by a recipe that I have taken the time to write a review!   This was SO GOOD and SO EASY.  As a working woman, I am always looking for fast and easy ways to get a delicious dinner on the table.   Following the recommendation of a couple other reviewers, I used ALOT more mushrooms than the recipe called for - i used two pre-packaged containers.  I used 3 T of butter and just once around the pan of olive oil - i did use cooking spray to coat my pan at the get go.   I served with microwave steam and mash garlic potaoes and microwave steamed green beans.   So good and on the table in less than 30 minutes, and most importantly, my husband loved it too!  Will definitley put into the line up - thanks Lisa!

Excellent recipe! I could not find Marsala wine so I used another dry red wine. I did not use sherry. I used 1 cup of red wine with a cup of chicken broth as another reviewer suggested. It was DELICIOUS, simple and fast. Our family loved it and I will definitely make it again! We served it with steamed broccoli.

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I loved it!  I am looking forward to making it for my parents and close friends. They always love when I try something new, especially when it is so delicious.  This will become a dish I make on a regular basis.  It is also unbelieveable how easy it is to make.  I used crimi mushrooms which gave it an extra deep flavor.

Excellent. I didn't change anything; I did not need to thicken the sauce, as the flour on the chicken did it for me! A cream sauce would change it up too much, I think. 
Edit: after making this a few times I realized I alway shave a lot to throw away on the plates; it seems I am the only one who likes it. so it is deleted from my recipe box.

Excellent. I add basil to the flour mixture and 1/2 c. chicken broth to the sauce. Since it's hard to find kosher Marsala wine, I mimic it with a combination of 2 parts wine, 2 parts brandy, and 1 part amaretto liqueur. The result is beautiful and delicious.

This Chicken Marsala is very good as well as simple.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed.  The Marsala flavor is delicate and I cannot imagine covering it up with garlic and onions as described in some of the other reviews.  Thanks!

Really really yummy! Made this for the roommate and I and some friends and it was a huge hit! I made garlic mashed cauliflower with it and it was super yummy and great for leftovers.

This was amazing and super easy. My husband raved and asked for it to be added to the weekly rotation - I can't wait to make it again. Didn't need to change a thing!! Served over brown rice and grilled asparagus - YUM.

This was Fantastic!! I did add heavy cream to make the sauce creamier and added 1/8c extra of each wine and it turned out creamy and wonderful! My mother in law LOVED it! (Thank goodness-whew!)

way too much oil and butter-and no garlic? I was excited to try this, but it was very bland.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The marsala flavor came through wonderfully.  I made no changes to the recipe and it was phenomenal.  I served it with some grilled asparagus and there were no leftovers.

We loved this. Next time I will cut back on either the oil or butter though because as you can see from the picture, the finished chicken was just sitting in it. I didn't notice anyone else complaining of this so it must have been something I did wrong or either my chicken breast were really small. Regardless, it tasted wonderful and was restaurant quality.

Love it! We serve it over spaghetti and with garlic bread and salad. It's a great meal. The only difference is that we used a whole package of sliced mushrooms not just a cup. Oh and chopped onions and minced garlic. Yum!

This was fantastic- the whole family loved it!  The only change I made was I added about a tablespoon of flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.  I will be making this again!

So good and so fast. The only thing I do different is I take out the chicken to saute the mushrooms. If you dont the pant gets way too crowed to let the mushrooms get any color

This was very good.  One thing I want to point out--DO NOT USE SWEET MARSALA WINE.  It was way too sweet.  I made that mistake, and fortunately had time for a do-over.

This is a great simple recipe with a few changes to suit my taste.  The chicken got coated with a flour, egg, and seasoned bread crumbs. I doubled the marsala and sherry wine so that I may toss more sauce with the angel hair pasta that I had paired it with.  Also, 1/4 cup of chicken broth and added a bit more salt in the end with a corn starch slurry to thicken. Great recipe!

I definitely was not wowed by this as I was expecting to be... I think it had something to do with the flour coating?  I'm going to follow some other reviewer's advice and coat in bread crumbs also.  I am excited to make this again.

This was very good.  I added sour cream and a little corn starch to thicken up the sauce.  I also added some garlic salt because the end product was a little bland. Overall, good, I'll make it again.

This was pretty tasty. I made very few changes to the recipe (I tried to stay as close as possible). I followed the advice of another rater and used a Ziploc bag to coat the chicken for easier clean up. I added some extra spices to the flour mixture-- basil, garlic, parsley, and marjoram. I also added fresh garlic to the butter and oil (we like garlic). The only change I really made was I didn't use sherry, but only because I didn't have any. I just supplemented with extra Marsala. I served it over penne pasta. It was pretty good, and I will make it again, but I'm going to play with the recipe. Perhaps next time I'll add some whipping cream to the remaining sauce! Thanks for a nice recipe.

This was pretty good, but not nice Italian restaurant good. Will make again. My chicken came out a little bit slimy, perhaps because my oil and butter was not hot enough for fear of burning the butter. I think I'll brown them in just olive oil next time and add the butter to the sauce after truly browning the chicken.

My Husband and I ate out in Olive Garden and we ordered Chicken Marsala there, we liked it so much that I decided to cook it at home. I did some research and came across this recipe. I decided to give it a try and defiantly don't regret it! It tastes better than Olive Gardens recipe!!! I substituted mash potatoes instead of pasta as a side dish. Great Recipe!!! Highly recommend to anybody!

This was an easy and amazing recipe!  I didn't make many modifications.  I added fresh garlic for more flavor and seasoned the flour with garlic and onion powder.  I also cut the chicken into smaller pieces since I always have a hard time cooking big pieces.  The next time I think I will add cream as many suggested to thicken up the sauce.

AMAZING!!!  A few things:  add garlic and onions to the olive oil/butter in the beginning, brown the chicken and then REMOVE it.  Then brown the mushrooms and add the wine and a few splashes of heaving whipping cream.  Add the chicken back in and turn the heat to low to help thicken the sauce.  This was GREAT!!!!  Super easy but a little time consuming.  WELL WORTH IT!  I also served the cheese onion garlic bread that's on this site too.  YUM

Great!! I cut the sherry and replaced it with Marsala cooking wine. Also, I sautéed 4 cloves minced garlic in the butter before adding the chicken, added ¼ cup diced white onion to the mushrooms, and added a splash of heavy whipping cream and corn starch + water mix to the Marsala wine to thicken the sauce and make it more creamy. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms and sauce. Very good with mashed potatoes!

Great recipe!  I took others advice and doubled the mushrooms.  Next time I'll double or triple the sauce.  It was easy to make and my husband loved it.  Thanks.

This recipe will definately impress anyone you serve it too!  My guest only complaint was that there wasn't enough 'sauce'.  I added just a little flour water to make it a little more gravy like - even the kids loved it!

Really easy meal.  Can make in 20 minutes and everyone loves it.  Even prepared it ahead for a crowd and warmed it up in the oven and it was still sooo good.

I would rate this a 3.5 as written (I wanted to try it first with the original recipe to be fair), but once I tweaked it by adding garlic, chicken broth and some milk, it became a 4.  The sauce was really great, but I felt my chicken needed more flour on it.  I would definitely make this one again with my changes.

I could not stop eating this! I did add 2 garlic cloves (minced) with the chicken, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe but my sauce ended up tasting kind of bland.  I added salt at the end, but that only did so much.  The potential is definitely there and I will try again.

Absolutely simple and delicious.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.  I did omit the olive oil to cut down some of the fat and calories and it was still perfect. I didn't measure the mushrooms, but just sliced up a small container and added them all.  I served it over linguini with garlic bread.  Next time I think I will try to add a splash of cream per the other recommendations.  This is a definite keeper!

Really yummy and so easy to make! I did make some small changes.  I added another teaspoon of sea salt and freshly ground pepper. The oregano was unchanged. I cut the butter by half and added an extra tablespoon of EVOO.  Also sauteed 1/2 of a finely chopped shallot onion. Thickened up the sauce a bit with an extra slurry of flour and water.  Served it with a side of long grain wild rice and green beans (sauteed with EVOO, tad of salt, pepper, and crushed honeyed almonds).  My husband and I loved it!

I modified this recipe a bit by caramelizing a large, thinly sliced onion in the evoo and butter first, then adding the mushrooms, omitting the sherry and increasing the marsala to one cup. when served, grate fresh Parmesan cheese over it. It brings it to a much richer recipe. Hubby's favorite.

I had left over marsala from another recipe so I made this. It was pretty bland despite adding a mixture of many italian spices to the flour (I thought just oregano seemed pretty bland) and also garlic as at least one other reviewer suggested. It wasn't inedible, but I wouldn't make it again. Just very plain and lacking something. hardly any flavor at all. I even added extra mushrooms and made only 3 chicken breasts instead of 4. I don't know what would make it better, though. I've never had chicken marsala before so I don't have anything to compare it to. This was just pretty "blah." sorry. I wanted to like this. Although, I'm discovering that every recipe I make with marsala isn't very good. I'm using the good stuff, so maybe I just don't like marsala? who knows.

Made the recipe just as directed, it turned out very good!  i used canned mushrooms and could tell no difference.  only problem, it didnt reheat really well.  the marsla/sherry/oil separated to a not-so-appetizing looking sauce. make it, just eat it all first go round!

WOW! This is a fantastic recipe. I wanted to make a nice dinner for my boyfriend.  This is very easy to prepare and the flavor is totally scrumptious. I followed recipe as is, just added more shrooms. It turned out perfect. My boyfriend was very happy, so I will make it again for sure.

FANTASIC! This was so good and sooo easy to make! I had no Idea chicken marsala was so easy to make. This is like what was served at my wedding and all the guests said it was the best food they had ever had at a wedding. I did make just a few changes... I added onion power, garlic salt and wine/garlic seasoning to the flour mix. I made 3x the sauce and I added heavy cream to make it creamy and then thickened the sauce. Served over browned butter and garlic pasta. Was Great and a new favorite meal! Will make this one lots!

Delicious.  I changed the recipe by browning the chicken first.  When browned I removed it to a plate and added the mushrooms to the pan.  I browned the mushrooms a bit and then added the wines to deglaze the pan.  I returned the chicken to the pan and simmered, covered for 10 minutes.  I removed the finished chicken to a serving platter and finished the sauce with a tablespoon of butter to thicken and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for added flavor. I then poured the mushrooms and sauce over the chicken breast.  Served with wild rice and a vegetable.

This is a very easy and quick recipe, making it a great choice for a weeknight dinner. I've made this dish multiple times and each time it gets rave reviews. As a side dish, I've tried garlic buttered noodles as well as brown rice. Both are an excellent side dish and a great way to enjoy the delicious sauce.

I had some dehydrated porcini mushrooms which I soaked in red wine and used in the sauce. The mushrooms made the sauce a beautiful brown colour. It was really good. Also, I added some garlic prior to browning the chicken.

This is a very basic and quick chicken marsala. Could use a little more depth in the flavor. But it's good for a quick weeknight dinner.

GREAT!  Abe loved it (I did too) and it was sooooo easy!  I bought the pre-sliced and cleaned mushrooms.  Pounding the chicken took a little time but it was good stress relief ;-).  I used 3/4C. Merlot wine (couldn't find kosher marsala wine or sherry).  I skipped the salt in the beginning and lightly salted once they were almost done (after the fire was off and they were covered, waiting to be served) since kosher chicken is usually pretty salty already.  Served with linguine, salad, eggplant dip, and hummus.  Dessert was blondies and grapes.  YUM!!!

Fantastic!!!  The mushrooms were tasted just like butter!  I used the Tyson trimmed and ready chicken breasts...they didn't need to be pounded because they were already the correct thickness.

Oh my goodness! This was amazing! I've only been cooking for about a year, but this recipe made me look like a master chef in the eyes of my husband. I did make a few modifications though due to some suggestions of other reviewers. To keep it low fat, I only used about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil and no butter. Before browning the chicken I briefly sauteed the mushrooms with 2 large minced garlic cloves in a 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Then I removed the mushrooms and set them aside until the recipe instructed to add them. I used 3/4 cup of Marsala and no sherry. When the chicken was fully cooked, I removed it, leaving the mushroom Marsala sauce still in the skillet. I then used some corn starch in a small amount of chicken broth to thicken the mushroom Marsala sauce. Lisa, thank you so much for such an amazing recipe!!! Not only did my husband love it, but I am still licking my chops!

I doubled the recipe. It was wonderful, everyone, even my picky brother thought it was good (he avoided the mushrooms though). I seasoned the chicken w/ some garlic ahead of time, but that was the only change I made. I served it w/ rice pilaf.

Good recipe my husband loved it.  I would add more mushrooms and let the sauce reduce a little longer.  I also added some parma ham and mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken.  I'm always looking for quick recipes for the great classics and this one worked great.

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out great.  I did add a little heavy cream at the end and also added garlic and italian seasoning to the sauce. I did cut down on the oil and the butter since I was going to use the cream. Everyone wanted the recipe!

DELICIOUS, and pretty quick and easy.  I made this over and over when I was expecting, and we still aren't sick of it!  I make it with dairy-free margarine and use less butter (in my case, margarine) and oil than called for and it's still delicious. We serve it over sticky rice and we don't thicken the sauce.  Very, very good.

Great, easy recipes...I had to add a few things so didn't give it a 5. As other's I omitted the Sherry doubled on the Marsala. I included garlic powder and basil in my flour mixture. Also, caralized a sweet onion in a separate pan to add. Cooked the chicken, set a side. Added Marsala, doubled the mushrooms, added light creamy (not much maybe 1/4 c at most) then reduced about 6-7 mins then added the chicken back. Served over cheese ravioli...so good!

This was my first attempt at making marsala, and it came out perfect.  It tasted better than any marsala I've had at a restaurant.  I changed only a few things.  First, I added garlic to the butter and olive oil.  Once I browned the chicken, I removed it and set it aside.  I then added probably 4 cups of freshly sliced mushrooms to the butter/oil.  As the mushrooms were simmering I added a little over a cup of marsala wine.  I didn't use any sherry.  I then added a full can of chicken broth and about a cup of heavy cream.  I seasoned the sauce with garlic salt and pepper.  Then I added the chicken back to the pan and let everything simmer for about 10 minutes.  The sauce was the perfect consistency - not too thick and not too thin.  I then served the whole dish over angel hair.  There was plenty of sauce to go around - plus enough leftover to serve with the leftover chicken the next day.  This will definitely be a staple dinner in my house!

Delicious and easy--I bake it for about 15 mins on 350 to thicken it up a bit-I make it all of the time and love it each time!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. It was incredibly easy yet really elegant. I, like many others, added a splash of heavy cream, and I also used portabella mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good.  Followed the recipe pretty close.  I made the mistake of only using butter to cook the chicken in.  The problem with that, is that the butter all cooked down and I had to keep adding more.  Really nasty looking pan.  I think I will do 3T of oil, and 3T of butter next time.  I also cooked the chicken, and removed, then deglazed the pan with 1 cup of sweet marsala, then added the chicken back to the pan, covered and cooked for 10 min.  I was prepared to add some cornstarch to thicken, but it wasn't necessary.  The wine glazed up and stuck to the chicken and noodles I served it over just perfect.

This was SOOOOOOO good! I followed the recipe except that I used chicken thighs that I pounded thin, and added a whole 8 oz. box of mushrooms (which was probably more like 2 cups). To finish the sauce at the end, I added in a splash (1/4 C.?) of non-fat "half-and-half". We had plain gnocchi on the side, but next time I'll try egg noodles. This is a keeper!

This was terrific and very easy to make. I doubled the mushrooms, but could have used even more. As per another review, I doubled the marsala wine and skipped the sherry.

excellent-iwork@a 4 decade-old italian restaurant and would put this up against ours. 2 changes-sub marsala 4 sherry and remove chicken & mushrooms to plate, then use blender to 'cream' the sauce. Thickened,w/o extra ingredients,the sauce all sticks to your chicken,instead of your plate! Also, try the marinade listed on this site to intensify flavors.

I loved the flavor of the sauce and didn't alter it but I think the cooking time of the chicken was too long as it was a bit tough.  May try thicker pieces next time.

I always get compliments on this.  I tweaked it just a little.  I removed the chicken after browning, added a little more oil and sauteed a clove of crushed garlic with the mushrooms.  I then deglazed the pan with a little of the marsala before adding the rest of the liquid.  I doubled the liquid too, so there would be plenty for the mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

LOVE this recipe. Will make it again and again. I use whole-wheat flour, and remove the chicken after browning. Then i add the mushrooms, onions, and some garlic. After cooking those a little, I remove most of it before adding the marsala wine. I don't use cooking sherry and it still tastes great. I just use LOTS of marsala wine.  YUM. After bringing that back to a simmer I add the chicken to cook. When finished, I remove the chicken again, put the mushroom/onion/garlic mixture back in, and add 1/4 cup milk. While heating this I sprinkle in a lot of the leftover flour mixture to thicken the sauce up. Delicious!

I liked this recipe, . . . didn't love it.  It seemed as though there was something missing.  I did add garlic as some other reviewers had said, and I used only Marsala wine as some other reviewers had said (only because I don't really care for the flavor of Sherry).  It was ok, but I think I am still on the hunt for a Chicken Marsala Recipe.

As is this recipe is mediocre.  I've made better from other recipes.  This doesn't have enough flavor, mushrooms, wine, etc.  Good starting point if you've never made this before.

Yum! My fiance and I love this recipe. He said it was the best chicken recipe I have cooked for him so far. I did some modifications...added more oregano and about 3-4 cups of mushrooms. And I omitted the butter and used only olive oil. And I thickened the sauce with flour a little so that we could eat the chicken and the sauce over pasta. It was absolutely delicious and the presentation and aroma was fantastic!

The BEST chicken recipe that I've ever found. This is better than any Chicken Marsala that I've ever had in any restaraunt! Normally I don't care for Chicken Marsala but this recipe changed my taste buds. You HAVE to try this recipe- it's absolutely incredible! I serve it with the garlic mashed red potatoes recipe that I got off of allrecipes.com also. I also have served it once over long grain wild rice- and that is also super yummy as well! I always add a bit of the leftover flour mixture from coating the chicken to the wine sauce before serving so that it thickens the marsala sauce and it's a yummy gravy for the mashed potatoes or a great sauce to serve over the rice. ENJOY! :o)

This really is an easy weeknight meal.  It comes together fast and I really like that it stays warm enough that you can eat in shifts if you have too. 
The only change that I made was adding some sweet onions.  I had seen that in another recipe.  
The one thing I like the most is it makes me feel like a really good cook, but I will never tell my guests how easy it really is.

One of my favorite chicken recipes!!!  I do add chopped onion, diced garlic and extra marsala.  (Tip-- also works with thighs instead of breasts, which don't get as dry when cooking.)  Thank you so much for sharing this one.  It is simple, amazing tasting and can have a fabulous presentation for dinner parties.

This was very easy and tasty. I tripled the sauce so we had extras for over mashed potatoes (wuold usually only double because we like a lot of sauce!).

Otherwise, the only other thing I changed was to skip the oil--it just didnt seem necessary with all that butter. The sauce reduced nicely on its own. Next time I will add onions.

Holy cow! A-maz-ing!

I followed this recipe exactly.I ended
up letting the sauce reduce a bit and darken and adding a little cornstarch/water mixture. I served it over mashed potatoes. Both my husband and I fell in love.

I made this awhile ago and just forgot to rate and review.
But it's very good. I didn't change a thing and it was delicious. Even better the next day, reheated.

This recipe has had lots of reviews so I won't say anything except it's really, really good. Do add a little cream and omit the sherry. Everything else is perfect!

Truly a great dish! I "improved" on it a little myself tho, before dusting your chicken w/ flour, use spices! I added sage, rosemary, garlic and basil. I didn't use the sherry, but insted used a teaspoon of sherry vinegar, and I used a full cup of marsala wine. Also, when I added the wine and vinegar I put in about 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic - amazing!!!

This is delicious. I was frightened of all the butter and oil (got a sensitive stomach when it comes to that stuff), so I only used 2 T of oil and 1 T of butter. Turned out just fine.

oh my! this was such a simple recipe for a quick dinner and it was very very tasty. it's a friday evening, it's been a long day and i just had some mushrooms and chicken..... and voila... the recipe did it all!!! dinner was absolutely amazing. chicken was so succulent, tender and tasty. i didn't really follow the measurement for 2 people - i basically put in a lot more mushrooms, and a lot more wine and sherry (well... i did have a glass (or two...) red wine whilst cooking.... result was just impressive.... and that's coming from me who doesn't really cook much!!! such a cheap recipe.... but incredibly tasty and easy... considering my mom always told me that i'll never be able to cook in the kitchen... this result is just superb and she won't believe i cooked it!!!!

really 4.5 I added garlic to brown the chicken with, and added heavy cream, and a bit of sour cream to the wine sauce because I'm really not a wine fan. The chicken was great, I still wasn't too sold on the sauce. I did use the cooking wine, I may need to try it again with the good stuff. I'll probably make it again.

This dish came out really great, just like restaurant quality. One thing I did that made the chicken turn out AWESOME was use a package of "Perdue Perfect Portions - Italian style." You get 6 filets, each one is about 1/4" thick, and they are PRE seasoned with italian herbs, so all you have to do really is coat each one with flour, you dont need to add additional oregano or other herbs. I took suggestions from other reviewers and added a tsp of minced garlic to the butter/oil (really added to the flavor), used sliced baby portabella mushrooms, added some onion slices, used double the amount of marsala wine (NOT marsala cooking wine, sweet marsala wine), added a splash of cream to the sauce, and added about 2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken it up a little. Served it all over garlic mashed potatoes, and it was really good! Everyone was impressed.

This recipe is very good. I have made it a couple of times. The first time I made the huge mistake of making the sauce too thick and it was not good.  I recommend sticking to the recipe and adding more mushrooms and doubling the sauce, but be very careful about adding flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce. If you need to thicken the sauce use wondra and do it very sparingly. I served this dish with the Aparagus with Cashews recipe from this site and everyone loved the presentation and the taste of everything - better than their favorite restaurant I was told. Thank you for such an easy and tasty recipe.

This was good.  Easy too.  I didnt use the oregano and should have used more mushrooms(and I dont like mushrooms!!!)  The mushrooms took on the marsala flavor excellently!  Served over egg noodles.  Very tender chicken. Maybe next time some onion and garlic added with the mushrooms.  Might try thickening the sauce too. A keeper.

This was very good and everyone liked it for Easter dinner. I would not flour it next time, however. That is not necessary at all. Also, I thickened it with corn starch as some other reviewers suggested so I could serve it over pasta, but I would not do that again either since I thought it detracted from the taste. I used lots of mushrooms and some onions and they were really great.

Delicious!  I added 1/4 t of garlic powder to the breading & sauteed with fresh minced garlic.  Before adding the marsala & sherry, I removed about 1/2 of the oil left in the pan to make it less greasy.  After letting the sauce simmer for a few minutes, I added 1/4 C of 1/2 & 1/2 to give it a creamy texture.  This was wonderful!

I like this recipe a lot and usually serve it with roasted potatos. I also like to add a clove or two of garlic to the pan while I'm browning the chicken and prefer to cut the butter down by at least half. Instead of using cooking sherry, I just pop open a bottle of red wine and donate one glass to the dish. The rest goes to the chef and guests.

WOW! Very good. I doubled the sauce as others suggested and added a splash of whipping cream and chicken broth to turn it into a creamier sauce(after cooking the chicken). Served it with pasta. Delcious! Definitely one of our family favs!

Excellent!  Chicken Marsala is one of my favorite dishes, but it can get very bland and boring if not done properly.  This recipe is perfect!  Easy and quick to prepare, perfect flavors (I added a little more salt and pepper than the recipe called for), and impressive enough to serve company.  My entire family gobbled it up, and there were no leftovers.  This proves sometimes the simplest dishes are the best!

Mmmmmmmm.... This was so incredibly easy! I added garlic, onions, almost doubled the mushrooms, and a little cream at the end.  I am going to keep this recipe for when I have my parents over for dinner.  Dad is not a meat eater, although likes certain chicken dishes.  This will be a perfect dinner to serve!

This was dish delish! I am not the best cook by any means, but you'd never know eating this dish I made with this great recipe. My Italian husband said he would put it right up there with a great Italian restaurant marsala. The only things I did differently was I put some parsley in the flour mixture rather than oregano bc I don't care for oregano, and after I initially cooked the chicken, I took it out of the pan so I could fry the mushrooms a bit alone and then I added the chicken back in. I also did not have sherry so I upped the marsala to 3/4 of a cup. I served it over angel hair. 
THE BEST!

I made this recipe even easier and more South Beach friendly. I just defrosted frozen boneless chicken breasts, cut them into 1-1/2 inch slices and threw them in the pan with the oil and margarine. I sprinkled 1/4 C. of wheat flour mixed with salt, pepper and oregano over the top of the chicken in the pan and then stirred it around a bit. After the chicken had cooked awhile, I added in the mushrooms and onions and stir-fried until they were done. Then I added 1/2 C. of red wine, since that's what I had and let it cook on high heat until the sauce thickened some. It was a little purple due to the red wine, but everyone raved about how delicious it was and it was very quick and easy done this way.

This chicken marsala recipe was the best I've tried. It was very delicious and very easy. I took a few suggestions from others and added just a little heavy whipping cream to the sauce towards the end to make it richer. I used 3/4 cup marsala wine since I was out of sherry. Also, in a separate pan, I very lightly sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic before adding them to the chicken as the recipe called. I think the garlic added some extra flavor. Great recipe and will be used again.

I am really a lousy cook, but this was really good and very easy to make.  The only change I would make next time is to double the amount of mushrooms.

I have made this recipe a good five times in the past year. It is the best chicken marsala recipe I've ever tried.  I did add some more mushrooms, otherwise I prepared everything as it says.

I didn't have any Marsala wine, so I used Moscato (Sutter Home), which is one of our favorites. This is a great recipe!!

I liked this recipe - very easy to make and very tasty. I added fresh garlic to the mix as I believe the recipe calls for it normally. Also, doubling the sauce is a good idea. You can do that by adding a little extra wine or some chicken broth. Definitely a keeper!

this was great....I have made chicken marsala many times, but I never made it with sherry, my husband doesn't like mushrooms, so I used onions instead. This was great, will make again.

Very good recipe and very easy to prepare.  The only variation was that I used a gravy and browning sauce to make the marsala a but thicker and browner.

YUM, YUM, YUM!! My husband always orders this at restaurants so I was very reluctant to make it at home for him. He absolutely LOVED it and said I "outdid myself once again". I made a few changes by adding garlic and chicken broth as other reviewers recommended. I also doubled the sauce and served it with angel hair. I plan on making this regularly. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this all throughout the summer (twice in one week, once), and it's still one of my favorites. I used red wine a few times (still turned out amazing) and I used an Italian spice blend instead of oregano. I definitely agree with adding more mushrooms. If you plan to refrigerate it (and eat it cold), though, use less oil/butter (down to 1 Tbs. each) so it won't solidify in the fridge...doesn't sound so appetizing in writing, but I'm sticking with what I said before: it's one of the best recipes I've ever used for chicken.

This is a great recipe, although the sauce was a little to runny. I will definately prepare this one again, maybe adding a small amount of flour to thicken it up. I would also add some onions and garlic for a richer flavor.

This was delicious and very easy! I used 2 chicken breasts, an 8 oz. package of sliced mushrooms and served it over angel hair pasta. DH loved it and he's not normally a big fan of chicken! I usually cook with dry marsala, but since this also included dry sherry, I used sweet marsala and it turned out just right. Don't even think about using cooking sherry - it's just plain nasty! The only thing that I will do differently next time is to increase the spices a little in the flour mixture, due to personal preference. Thanks, Lisa! This one is definitely a keeper!

Really great but I added twice the amount of cooking sherry and Marsala wine so I would have more sauce.  I love to serve this over a bead of linguine.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic! I made a few of my own adjustments. First, I  took the advice of a previous reviewer and put the flour mixture in a large ziplock bag to cut down on mess. I also added some garlic to the oil/butter mix after cooking the chicken for a few minutes. I used 1 cup of wine and no sherry. And I also added a little bit of flour to the sauce to thicken it up. Yummy!

This was so easy and yummy! However, I didn't use the Sherry, just more Marsala and simmered a bit longer then 10 min, also added a bit of flour to the sauce to make a bit thicker. Served with garlic mashed potatoes!  I will be serving this again!

Oops! I used sweet marsala by accident! Still came out delicious! The sweetness actually reminded me of The C********e Factory's Chicken Madeira! I made some minor adjustments, I added 2T minced garlic and 1T kosher salt. Yummy!

Delicious...But needs more cooking time for alcohol to burn off. After chicken is browned I remove it so alcohol can burn out w/out overcooking the chicken, Then I put chicken in to finish cooking

Very good!!!  I changed a few things - I don't like breading so I skipped that all together and just lightly browned the chicken in 2 TBS of oil and buttter (each) and a clove of garlic.  I removeded the chicken and put it in a baking dish with some marsala wine and baked until finished.  I added the marsala wine (I used dry wine), another TBS of butter and mushrooms to the pan.  I cooked it for about 1/2 an hour and it was good but I like my marsala a bit sweeter - so I added about 2 TBS of brown sugar - AWESOME!  Definitely makes it so much better - my husband raved!  I used a lot of wine - I say just eyeball it and plan on using most of the bottle.

I used veal instead of chicken.  I also used a white port instead of traditional sherry.  I added about 1/2 onion and used a ton of mushrooms because I love mushrooms and onions.  The recipe didn't make much if you're having it over noodles, so the next night I made a 2nd batch of onions and mushrooms only because I still had some leftover veal.  This is so simple and easy, and can make even the beginner look good.  I also would use real butter instead of any fake butter stuff...I think the creamy flavor of REAL butter is key.  My girlfriend totally loved this.

The next time I will reduce the amount of Marsala and add chicken broth as the flavor was too strong.

This recipe is one of the easiest to make but yet it looks and taste like it was made with alot of effort. I added heavy cream like others have suggested to make the sauce creamy and next time I will add double the mushrooms and sauce so that I can serve angel hair pasta. This was a hit with my family, it will be added to our meal rotation.

I love this recipe! This is the third time I've made it and it is always a hit! I love the oregano in it so add a little extra. I usually do 3/4 marsala and 1/4 sherry and watch the salt I add in the flour mixture. I take the chicken out of the pan and sautee the mushrooms in the brown bits from the chicken because I like my mushrooms more "done". I served it with baked potatoes and it was mighty tasty.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  It had a really good flavor. The only thing I did diffently was to reduce the amount of salt by half.  Next time, though, I think I might add more mushrooms to it.

I make this recipe every so often, and it always turns out great.  (Yes, it is oily/greasy, but tastes good!)  I try to pair it with a more light dish...

Great recipe, with a few additions. I agree - the liquid/sauce isn't thick enough for my liking. Also, the butter used makes it a bit too salty, and the marsala sauce I prefer should have a bit of a sweet taste, and this lacks that touch. In order to thicken the sauce and bring the taste to my liking, I made the following additions: After the wine and mushrooms have been added in the skillet, mix 1/4 Cup low-fat buttermilk, 3/4 Cup water, 1 TBSP sugar, 1 TBSP cornstarch and 3 TBSP of marsala wine together. Pour into skillet and bring to a boil with lid off. Once rapidly boiling, add 1/8 TSP pepper and 1/8 salt to skillet. At this time cover, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes. This is great served over spaghetti or alongside buttered spaghetti noodles, topped with romano cheese.

I would have rated it 5 but I had to make adjustments. I added 1 can of chicken stock and some cornstarch to get the sauce just right. It was excellent!

Wow, this recipe is fantastic!  I can honestly say I have never had chicken marsala that was this good.  I used the baby bellas, and did it over Pasta Roni Butter & garlic pasta.  Perfect, quick, easy, and better than the restaurants.

This was so delicous!!  At the end of simmering the sauce and chicken I did remove the lid and brought it to a boil so that some of the sauce could cook down and thicken up.

I thought this was a very good recipe!  Mine wasn't that sweet, but maybe I didn't use enough marsala wine because I cooked only 2 chicken breasts.  I think next time I will use fresh mushrooms instead of canned (that's all I had at the time), but besides that it was delicious and very tasty!  I will make it very often for myself!  Great leftover as well and great with rice!  Thanks to the submitter!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I made it exactly as directed. The second time, I used all marsala and more mushrooms. It was better the second time. However, the sauce is missing flavor. I want to make this again and sautee some garlic before adding the chicken, maybe even minced onions. A sprinkle of salt and pepper at the end will help a lot too. The sauce is too thin for my liking. Adding heavy cream would help or some diluted cornstarch. It has a lot of potential but it is not perfect.

I made this recipe tonight, and it turned out great.  I ended up using at least twice as many mushrooms (cremini) and a little more sherry/marsala.  I also forgot to pound the chicken breasts.  But it still turned out fantastic and extremely tender.  My boyfriend said we have to make this again!  I agree.

I made the chicken marsala last night for dinner, and it totally disappointed my husband and myself. I went all over creation trying to find marsala wine, and the recipe did not live up to my expectations. The sauce was bland and not very tasty, definetly not worthy of five stars!

This is a wonderful marsala recipe but I gave it 4 stars because it needs more sauce and mushrooms for my taste. I doubled the wines and used an 8oz. package of mushrooms. Tastes like a restaurant recipe!!

One of my favorite Chicken dishes to make. For more flavor I added thinly sliced onions to the butter and olive oil and then cooked the chicken. Gives it something extra. I also just cut the mushrooms in half so they could soak up the wine more. So good!

This was very easy! I used 1.65lbs of boneless chicken breasts and cut them into smaller portions. I was able to cook all the meat at once. I served it with a salad and angel hair pasta. This is a definite repeat.

I LOVE Italian food, and this was the best recipe ever.  I served it over Garlic Linguine and Olive Oil bread, two other All Recipes recipes that I found... it was like having dinner at an Italian Restaurant.  I've made this multiple times for others as well and everyone LOVES it.  Thank you so much for sharing this... and really not that hard to make might I add.

I made this twice in one week. I doubled the sauce and it still wasn't enough. Excellent recipe!

Not sure why it is rated so high, it was just ok. Chicken was very tender but the flavor was off. It was fun trying it at home but I guess we'll stick to eating it out. thanks anyway

I agree - this recipe is simple and delicious!  I like the flavor mushrooms impart, but I don't like the texture of them.  So, I simmered big chunks with the sauce so they were easy to pick out when I was ready to eat.

Great and oh so simple! I added corn starch and chicken broth ,as others suggested, to make more of a cream sauce and I used more marsala wine and omitted the sherry. You can't go wrong with this one.

VERY good, I added a splash of milk, didn't use sherry, and about 1 tsp. of flour to the sauce to thicken and used canned mushrooms, it turned out just like our favorite restaurant's version. Eat it over linguine with asparagus on the side.

Just got done cooking and eating this dish.  I am new in the kitchen and it was very simple and tasted great.  I served it with instant mashed potatoes and green beans sauted in oil, butter, and garlic.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This was better than any restaurants Chicken Marsala.  I served it for a dinner party and it was quick, easy and delicious.  I changed the recipe a little.  when the chicken was done I pulled it out and mixed in some flour and water to thicken the sauce.  I think it made it A LOT better.  I am already planning this for another of my dinner parties.

This recipe was AMAZING! I am not a chef, although I like to cook and can follow a recipe. I made this recipe for 66 people at my son's Christening and EVERYONE RAVED about this chicken. EVERYONE!!! The only difference is that I did not pound chicken breast halves as my recipe called for 40 pounds of chicken and my arms could not handle pounding 40 pounds of chicken. I would not have been able to hold my son the next day!!! As an alternative I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces which actually worked out a lot better for buffet style serving. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and loved every bite... we ate it for the Christening, for lunch the next day and dinner the following night. Absolutely DELICIOUS! Thanks for making the food portion of my son's Christening a screaming success!

Very tasty and quick to make too!  I used a thincker breast, which didn't absorb the flavor as much as I would have liked. Next time I may just use cutlets, or veal.

This is superb!  It literally melts in your mouth, especially if you let it simmer longer than 10 minutes.  I simmer it for at least 45 minutes.  I add more wine and sherry to make more sauce too.  I absolutely love it and can't get enough of it!

A little bland and oily the 1st time I made this (according to instructions). If you cut down on the either the oil or butter, use more marsala and skip the sherry, it's a 5 star. add a little brown sugar (if you like it sweeter)

Chicken was delicious but the sauce didn't thicken and there was too much butter & oil.  Next time I would cut the butter and oil in half, and after the chicken is cooked, set it aside and reduce the sauce, add a touch of cream to finish it.

This was a good recipe.  i did follow the advice to double the wine to create more sauce but then i felt that the wine taste overwhelmed the dish.  i then repeated with the normal amt of wine and it was better.  definitely use 1/2 or less of the oil and butter.  i did add some italian seasoning to the flour coating and i tried it with one can of cream of chicken soup to the sauce and that was good as well and makes the sauce thicker.

I love chicken marsala in general and this was excellent!  The only change made was omitting the oregano, just because I did not have any on hand.  Definitely will be making this again and again.  My family ate it all up...there was nothing left in the skillet.  

I chose to served it with foccacia bread & mashed potatoes.  It probably go well with noodles or rice as well.  If you are a vegetarian the mushroom and the sauce would be tasty. 

Thanks for sharing this recipe Lisa!

This recipe was simply delicious. For me and my fiancee's taste, I cut the amount of butter in half, doubled the olive oil, and the amount of marsala wine. I also added a dash of heavy cream to thicken the sauce, 3 cloves of minced garlic and simmered for 20 minutes. Finally, sauteed asparagus was served as a perfectly nutritious side.

My husband and I thought this was an excellent meal!  I am a bit challenged in the kitchen, but I was able to pull this off!  After reading the reviews, I did make a few changes such as instead of using sherry I used chicken broth.  I also omitted the oregano completely (We went to Greece a few years ago for our honeymoon where oregano is used too much in my opinion and now I stay away from it) instead I used garlic powder.  I also read were some people said this was too bland so I added a little extra salt and pepper.  I also doubled the sauce and the coating which was a good thing because I would have run out otherwise, but my chicken breasts were pretty big so I am sure that played a part.  I had also read where some people took the chicken out to bake to keep it form getting soggy so I decided to place two cooked breasts in the oven for a few minutes and cooked the other two as the directions said.  We ended up with two different meals, one with the chicken that was a little crispy that I put over angel hair pasta with spaghetti sauce and the other meal was with the Marsala sauce over the chicken and angel hair pasta.  Both of these versions turned out really well for us, but the chicken that I used the Marsala sauce on was so tender it was just falling apart, it practically melted in your mouth!  My husband rated this a 9 out of 10!  We will make again!  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

Yes, this recipe has a subtle flavor but you can spice it up with garlic and herbs.  I loved the flavor.  I took some hints from other reviews and cooked mine with onions, and I used basil, oregano, and garlic along with the garlic salt.  I found I had to cook mine a little longer, but was really pleased at how the sauce thickened with the extra cooking time.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

After reading several reviews of this dish, I decided to prepare according to recipe first and see how it tasted, except I halved the butter and olive oil, and in lieu of cooking sherry, just used Marsala wine for a total of 3/4 cups.  I agreed with several other reviews that the taste was rather bland, so I tried again, first marinating the chicken in a little marsala wine with salt, pepper, garlic powder, for an hour or so, increased the salt for the flour to 1 teaspoon and added some garlic powder and more black pepper to the flour. The sauce needed to be thickened so after completely cooking the chicken with the mushrooms, I took the chicken out and placed on plates, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken and increase the sauce as I was planning on serving the chicken over a bed of angel hair pasta and sauteed zuchinni (oil, a little salt, pepper, and a sprinkling of sugar). This turned out FABULOUS and delicious. Make sure to use good Marsala Wine--not cooking wine, but the one you buy in the wine section!

Yummy... My husband loves it.  We used to go to that really good Italian restaurant for Chicken Marsala.  Now I make it home and it is just as good, if not better.  The only thing I do differently is, I don't cover the skillet.  It takes a little longer but the chicken is juicier.

I took the advice of others and bought some sweet marsala wine from the wine shop. What a difference! Things I changed: I cut the butter and oil in half and it was still more than really needed . . . I skimmed some off. I threw in half of a minced shallot in the skillet before I added the chicken. After cooking for the 10 minutes, I took the chicken out of the pan, added some Wondra sauce and gravy flour (just a bit), and a tablespoon or two of half and half, and then let the sauce bubble just a bit. Then I served over the chicken. PERFECT!!!!!

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce and coating for 6 decent sized chicken breasts.  I also added garlic powder to the coating mixture.  Per another review, I decided to bake the chicken (covered) at 300 for about 40 minutes with the mushroom sauce mixture on top.  Therefore, I only browned the chicken for about 3 minutes on each side so it would remain juicy.  Thanks Lisa -- it's a keeper!

It is simple and delcious. Doubled the marsala and the sherry. Very important to use good quality Marsala, don't use the $4 supermarket Marsala, go to a wine store. Definitely add a clove of garlic or 2 when browning the chicken. We used 3 cups of mushrooms and that may still have not been enough. Yum yum. Can serve it with pasta, rice or what another reviewer said, mashed potatoes.

What a wonderful recipe for my favorite chicken dish!  One thing is missing, however: garlic.  The first time I made it I did not use any, and the dish was a bit timid.  Nex time, I added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic about halfway through cooking the chicken; it made a huge difference in the flavor.  One other addition: try topping the chicken with some deli hot ham chopped up a bit. (And don't cheap out on the brand of wine--kitchen brands don't do it justice!) A real restaurant quality dish!  Thanks for the recipe.

Not only have I made this recipe with MUCH praise from my family, but a good friend has also made it a regular menu selection!There was one change I would like to note. Adding 1/2 to 1 cup of heavy cream at the end made the dish much richer:)

Delicious, moist & so easy!!  I doubled the flour mixture - the amount called for seemed a bit skimpy.  I also doubled the sauce based on others' recommendations.  Letting the dish stand for a while before reheating slowly seemed to make it even better.  Great served over wild rice!!

I've had this in my recipe box for a while and finally made it tonight.  Basically, I followed the directions, but used a whole 10 oz. pkg. of fresh mushrooms and 1 cup marsala & 1 cup chicken broth for the sauce.  This is a tasty meal that really isn't difficult to make!

I made this last night for dinner and it was amazing! Probaly the best chicken marsala I've made! The only thing I would change is to add a little bit of garlic to the sauce while it's cooking. I like an extra kick in my food!

I 1/2 the oil/butter, doubled the marsala( no sherry), more mushrooms,2 cloves garlic, and Italian seasoning instead of oregano. added some chicken broth too, best dinner I have made in quite a while. Kids DID NOT like the sauce, so next time I'll take theirs out.  I will definatly use the rest of the bottle of wine!!

Excellent dish!!!  I added garlic powder (didn't have any fresh garlic) and fresh rosemary to the flour mixture.  Dipped the breast in egg before coating with flour.  Added a little cornstarch and water to thicken but the next time I'll use cream as suggested by some reviewers.  I will definitely be cutting down on the butter and olive oil the next time.  Can't wait to fix it again!!!  Thank you Lisa!!

Excellent recipe. Enjoyed by all family members, even those hesitant to try it. Per suggestions of others, I made the following adjustments: I used 6 chicken breasts, doubled the flour, pepper, oregano, wine and sherry. I added a teaspoon of basil to the flour mixture.  I cut the butter and oil in half and sauteed some garlic in the butter and oil. I used two cups of mushrooms. I did add about 2 Tablespoons of half and half just before serving. I served it over angel hair pasta. This is a wonderful dish and would be great to serve to company. Thanks Lisa!!!

This was pretty good.  I halved the butter and oil and added some minced garlic per other reviewers suggestions.  My hubby even went back for seconds!  Will definately make again.

Great recipe, better than what you order in resturants!! But could be a little dry, I recommand adding some starch, milk or cream at the end and turn the heat up to reduce!

Wonderful recipe!  I always double my wine/sherry to double the sauce for the pasta and broccoli I serve with it (thickening with a little cornstarch/chicken stock mixture).  I also add a heavy dash of garlic and onion powders to the flour.

have made this several times (and loved it every time!) and realized that sauteeing the mushrooms in a little butter first makes it all the better - otherwise they're not soft enough (for my liking, anyway!).  it really is a fantastic recipe!  & easy!  THANK YOU, LISA!!!  YUM!

Wow!  My search for the perfect marsala recipe ended once I tried this recipe.  I've made several marsala dishes and this was hands-down the BEST.  Preparation was simple, making it a perfect weeknight meal.  It took me 30-minutes, including clean-up, to make.  I followed the steps outlined in the recipe and it came out great...restaurant quality.  Thanks for sharing this one Lisa!

Very good!  Even my boyfriend's teenage kids like it.  Now there's a test!  I made it on a non-stick pan, however, and didn't get the brownness I would have liked.  An All-Clad or other non-stick would be better.  Otherwise, the recipe was ver good, quick and easy to make, and impressive. The only change I made was I added at least twice as many mushrooms, as a matter of taste.  Otherwise, it's keeper the way it is.

The last thing this recipe needs is another rating, but I just had to!  5 stars is just not enough.  I cut back on the oil and butter when browning the chicken, doubled the amount of mushrooms, and at the end added two Tablespoons of softened butter to bind the sauce.  I think that the sherry cuts the sweetness of the marsala and that is what makes this so special .

I have made this recipe twice and love it each time.  I do make a couple of additions/changes.  I add minced garlic into the chicken while it is cooking.  I also use 2 cups of portebello mushrooms.  To thicken the sauce, I use a little bit of the flour mixture that was used to coat the chicken.  Then I serve it over angel hair pasta.  Next time I will serve it with bow tie pasta.  All in all...great recipe!

This is a very easy recipe and wonderful.  I highly recommend it for people new at cooking that either want to impress a date or your folks.  I sometimes use more exotic mushrooms to add a more gourmet flair to it and typically serve it over "No Yolk" egg noodles for a lower cholesterol meal.

This recipe is good, but I added more mushrooms.  The sauce is light and flavorful, but if you are expecting something very robust, this isn't the chicken recipe for you.

This is a great easy recipe!  I have learned making a marsala is the best when you use the "real marsala wine" from a liquor store and not the grocery non-alcoholic marsala cooking wine.  I added chopped garlic and parsley too.  I have also used this recipe make "scallop marsala" - omit chicken and use sea scallops instead for the "non-meat" eaters who like seafood!

Thank you Lisa for an awesome recipe. I followed it exactly and just added 1 clove of chopped garlic when I added sliced portabello mushrooms. There was no need to thicken the sauce as it thickened nicely while it cooked. This is a perfect recipe to serve 2-3 so I would definitely double the sauce and mushrooms for more servings. This should be in the top ten! I have added it to my recipe box.

Outstanding!  At first, I read all of the reviews here, I decided to add chicken broth (half cup) with cornstarch (on your own measure) and it turned out great!!!  At first, 4 tablespoon of olive oil and butter didn't seem enough, so I added bit more.  I cooked chicken first then took them out when they turned brown.  I added Dry Sherry (House table, not the cooking one) and Marsala wine (Cooking wine) and sautee the mushrooms.  I added a lot for this (two boxes of sliced portabella and one box of whole mushrooms!)  When sauteed, I put the chicken back in the pan.  After looking at it, it didn't seem much sherry and marsala left in it, so I decided to add more.  I must have put in an extra cup of Marsala wine and half cup of Dry Sherry.  Let it simmer for awhile before putting in cornstarch.  Make sure you put cornstarch last in because it will turn thick immediately.   It tasted wonderfully!  It may seem like a lot of alcohol to you but everyone's taste is different.  Amazing dish!  (I probably put in too much alcohol due to a large cooking pan?)

Yummy! Other than cutting back on the butter by half, I followed this recipe to the letter. PERFECT! I'm not a mushroom fan, and I didn't need extra sauce to pour over anything. There was plenty of sauce for this non-mushroom, no extra sauce fan. Thanks for a great recipe Lisa!

Really excellent! I used shitake mushrooms too and it enhances the sauce too! I made a bit more sauce and glad I did. I also uncovered and let it reduce for 5-10 minutes too. 
Served in on a platter of fine noodles with butter and a touch of parmesan cheese! Even a non mushroom eater really loved it.

Delicious and simple!  However, it was tweaked: doubled flour and seasonings, used butter-flavored cooking spray instead of butter, and used tenderloins like another reviewer suggested.  The next time I will use 2 cups of mushrooms (I forgot about how much they shrink during cooking).

Very easy and tasty, but I think there was too much oil & butter called for. I would use less, or substitute butter flavored PAM for the butter. I used double the amout of mushrooms, added minced garlic, and topped with chopped fresh parsley. I also added just a touch of cream...just enough to make the sauce opaque. I used thin turkey cutlets since that what I had on hand. I can't wait to try it with chicken.

This is one of the easiest, most satisfying meal I have made in years.  My boyfriend liked it so much we had it for two consecutive Sunday dinners.  I recommend more mushrooms and serving with roasted potatoes on the side.

This recipe was very easy, but I followed a few of the other suggested modifications:  doubled the liquids and mushrooms.  Also, I only had chicken tenderloins so I used those instead of normal chicken breasts and they turned out very tender without the pounding. Overall, it turned out to have too much alcohol flavor even after simmering for 15 minutes.  I will make this recipe again, but I will keep the same amount of sherry and marsala (& do buy a good wine) and just add in a cup of chicken broth.

This recipe was delicious and so easy to prepare. I just love to make it whenever I've got some left over fresh mushrooms. It tastes like a special occasion dish, yet doesn't feel like one to make!

I am puzzled how this recipe got so many great ratings!  I am comparing it to the chicken marsala served at Buca di Beppo restaurant--the taste is totally different.  I expected this recipe to have a sweet, tangy taste and it didn't at all.  The mushrooms tasted just plain awful.  And I used the dry, good marsala wine and used a good red wine in place of the sherry to add a little more sweetness.  Maybe the chicken marsala I love is not representative of how this dish usually tastes?  I don't know.

Incredible!  To die for!  I made this for my husband on our anniversary.. VERY BIG HIT!!  I took others advice and doubled the mushrooms, added a bit more Marsala, and eliminated the cooking sherry (didn't have any on hand).  Served it over linguine noodles.  Very easy and quick, yet extremely elegant.  My kids even liked the left-overs!

My 4 year old ate this and loved it . . . as did the rest of my family!  The only thing is I doubled the wine the second time around because there wasn't nearly enough "sauce".  I'll be serving this at dinner parties for years to come!

Great little recipe, even with my substitutions.  I used white wine in place of marsala.  For the sherry, I used same amount of chicken broth and added about 1/4 cup of sour cream and it turned out wonderful.  I served it over buttered noodles with green peas on the side.  My husband went back for seconds!!

Magical recipe! I added a little heavy cream at the end to make the sauce a little thicker and creamier also made thin spaghetti to put the chicken on top with the sauce. Beautiful texture and taste.  Thank you!

Like others, I added my own take on this recipe by using garlic, Marsala and Sherry wines, and doubling the mushrooms.  I also added a little heavy cream to the sauce.  I served it with cheese ravioli, Caesar salad, and crusty bread. My family loved this dinner!

I made this tonight for dinner and kept hearing my husband's delighted sounds.  I substituted Bob's 1 to 1 gluten free flour for the all-purpose flour.  I also tenderized the chicken so the pieces were thin enough to cook quickly.  It worked perfectly  well as a gluten-free entree.

ALWAYS SKIP the salty sherry! If you want the sherry then use real sherry.  make this at least 3-4 hours BEFORE serving. then a SLOW reheat. it will just better........

Plated over spagetti.  Served with roasted asparagus.  It does need the bread to soak up the sauce.

I’ve made this a few times and every time it has been delicious, and so easy to make! I serve it with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans! No reason to fix what’s broke, this recipe is perfect just the way it is!

Quick,easy and , oh so  delicious!   I will definitely make it again.    Next time I may add some basil or Italian seasoning to the flour.  I used Wondra instead of all purpose flour.

Love this recipe. I never made this dish before. This is the first time i tried it. It turns out really really fabulous dish for dinner. I added whipping cream in it to make it creamy.

I've never made this before and was looking for something different for my husband's Valentine's Dinner. LOVED IT!!  I did read some of the other reviews and made a few adjustments as well such as using the 3/4 cup Marsala instead of using the Sherry. I also added a ton more mushrooms, simply because I love my mushrooms! Hee Hee!!  Also since I added so many extra mushrooms I added about 1/2 cup of Chicken Broth and a splash of heavy whipping cream.  I also took the advice of cooking noodles and adding basil, garlic and olive oil to them, then I served the Chicken over the noodles with the sauce.
Will definitely make this again for sure!!

This recipe is so easy and turned out amazingly! Because all the reviews said it took a long time to reduce, I added some flour to the mushrooms and stirred it to cook a few minutes longer before adding the wine and chicken stock, it worked great and it didn’t long to reduce and thicken up! DEFINITELY keeping this one

This recipe is fabulous!  I did add garlic and doubled the amount of mushrooms.  We found that it was very high on the alcohol side, so I added 1/3 cup of chicken stock to the sauce and it was perfect!  Thank you for sharing!

I used Cremini mushrooms so they were very flavourful. I did not pound the chicken. Both pieces were about 1" thick so I just left them simmering for an extra 5 minutes and used the meat thermometer to hit 75C Used Mrs. Dash in stead of salt but found that a little when eating really brought out the flavour. I also substituted Thyme

Alright! I paid attention to the most recent reviews, and put 3/4 cup o Marsala, also added 1/4 chip of Sherry, Heavy whipping cream, and finally cornstarch and water mixture to thicken. I am not a cook, by any means at all...but, this makes it taste like I am!!! It turned out amazing!!!

This recipe is really simple and adaptable to vegetarian chicken cutlets.. I used the new mycoprotein cutlets made by Quorn, warmed them for about 75 seconds, then floured and browned them in the butter/oil mixture. I did need to add an additional 2 ounces of water at the very end because the veggie cutlet absorbs some of the liquid while cooking. But all in all it came out very flavorful and moist. It is a welcome addition to my non-meat collection of recipes. Oh and I noticed in your video that you used white muchrooms. I used Baby Bella muchrooms to give the recipe a little more earthy flavor.

I haven't cooked often but with food prices so high I've had to start.  This is the first time I made this and I thought I screwed up because the sauce didn't look brown enough but I took a taste and WOW is it good.  One thing though , the directions on the page don't match the video so I was a bit confused but it still came out great.

I've made other Marsala recipes and this is the best so far.  I used chicken tenders instead so that saves having to pound out the chicken breast.  The cook time should be reduced too if you do that.  I browned and then simmered for  only 5 more minutes- leaving it to sit a couple of minutes more off the heat.

I also added green onions at the very end to add a bit of color, texture and I just plain like them.  

I added way more mushrooms as we really like mushrooms and it is really half the dish.  

I served over pasta.  Yum!

Gets 5 stars for being easy and very tasty!  The only additions I made was adding 1/4 cup of capers and thickened the sauce with a bit of the leftover flour mixture. Served over mashed potatoes.

I followed Ashley's suggestion about adding a little broth and some heavy cream.  Cooked the mushrooms separately and thickened the sauce slightly with a slurry of cornstarch and water.

This recipe is amazing, as is, but I did use extra mushrooms since we love them so much!  I did put the flour and seasonings in a plastic ziploc bag with the chicken and gave it a good shake to coat. I love the flavors of this dish, restaurant quality, and super easy. I served with pasta on the side and green beans. Will be making again and again!

This was a hit with my husband! I had difficulty finding a dish he would like as much as my lasagna and this dish made it lol 
I tweeked the recipe a tad: added 1 shallot to the melting oil and butter, removed the chicken after cooked with the sherry, masala, and mushrooms, then added a teaspoon of flour to the sauce and simmered till it was at a loose gravy consistencey to go with mashed potatoes. Turned out wonderful!

This recipe turned out delicious! We added more mushrooms. We also like more sauce, so we added more marsala wine & cooking wine & thickened it alittle.

I am not a great cook, but this recipe always comes out consistently good.

I typically use about 1/3-1/2 less oil and butter, and I'll drop the sherry and use more marsala instead (though tonight I'm going to try using both).

Serve with pasta, green beans and a nice white wine, and you have an easy date meal that only takes about half an hour to cook and tastes great.

This recipe received rave reviews from the family. I made only three chicken breasts and cut the oil and butter in half (2 TBLS) each). Also, as I was doing this at the last minute, I didn't have sherry so I used Marsala for the whole amount (3/4 cup).
It was easy, fast, and most importantly delicious! Company worthy. Close to tasting like a restaurant.

So amazing and easy!  I made it once as written, and it was good, but needed more sauce.  The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce and it was perfect.

The only change I made was to use chicken tenders rather than whole chicken breasts. I figured two per person. I had 8 people for dinner and 12 were eaten. I also served pasta so one chicken tender was enough for some. The breasts these days are so large. These were a good size and very tender.

We loved this dish. The only substitute I made was using Pino Gregio in place of the Marsala wine because I wasn't able to find it. I increased the amount of wine and sherry & added extra mushrooms also. I didn't pound my chicken, but just cut the breasts cross ways about 1 centimeter thick. I served it over fettuccini. WONDERFUL. Will definelty make this again.

I have been making this recipe at least twice a month.  My only change is I tripled the mushrooms since we can't get enough of them.  Wonderful recipe exactly as written.  Even the kids gobble it up.  I can't say enough about this recipe.

Notes to self: Make it with sherry and marsala wine. You like  it better that way. When you didn't coat the chicken in the flour it was easier and less messy, but the sauce was thin. You can thicken the sauce with cornstarch and water or flour and water mixture. Make extra sauce. You can add some chicken broth to stretch the sauce.  You added a little cream to the sauce and liked it. Add extra mushrooms. Add some spaghetti water back into the bowl of spaghetti to keep it from sticking and to keep it hot.  Also add some sauce directly to the bowl of pasta and mix it in.

I am not very gifted in the kitchen but this recipe was so easy to follow.  The dish came out beautifully.  I only used the marsala wine because I didn't have sherri but it was perfect.  This will now be a regular dinner time dish in my house. I added a little extra butter while simmering to make it extra creamy.

I made this and I liked it but only because I did not use the  "cooking sherry" from the grocery shelf!! uck!!! Never use "cooking sherry or cooking wine" from the grocery!!  Its nothing but sodium and stuff that shall stay un-named!!  If you want to really favor this recipe and others that call for wines or sherries  you can purchase small bottles of sherries and red and white wines at the liquor store to cook with and the alcohol burns /bakes off so your not "boozing" up the dish! The sherries  and wines will store fine on your shelves - the reds don't last as long as the whites and sherries but  taste 10+ times better than that "cooking" stuff!!  And if you drink wine -- never cook with something you wouldn't drink! But you already know that don't you. LOL

I will definitely make this again. The chicken was moist and the dish had a smooth and sophisticated flavor. This recipe is very easy to make and doesnt require a lot of ingredients. I made the following changes: The night before I cleaned, pounded, needled and marinated the chicken in inexpensive Italian dressing in a ziploc bag. (I do this with all chicken breasts that I buy.) In the oil/butter mixture I lightly sautéed slices of garlic to flavor the oil. Removed and discarded the garlic before adding the chicken. (I learned this from Joy of Cooking's Becker's Brussels sprouts recipe.) Followed the remaining recipe as written except added half of a small onion choppped along with the mushrooms as suggested by another reviewer. I need to find more recipes that use Marsala wine and sherry. Really nice flavor.

Easy to make and fantastic flavor! Added one tsp. of better than boullion and a tsp. garlic powder. Did not have sherry, so substituted 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1-1/2 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar and added water to make 4 tbsp. total liquid. This will be a definite favorite! Served with egg noodles and garden salad.

I have made this several times now. I always throw in more Marsala wine and extra mushrooms. Have not used the Sherry in it yet. I always do the flour and spices in a plastic bag. From other reviews I learned to add chicken stock and a bit of half and half/cream. I always take the chicken out after browning and then create the sauce in the pan and put the chicken back in to simmer. ALWAYS delicious!

I have a go-to recipe for chicken marsala, which I love. This recipe was far simpler so I was excited to find it, especially with all of the positive reviews. I followed this recipe to the letter and the flavor was really not good. There are a lot of good chicken marsala recipes out there but this, unfortunately, is not one of them.

A new recipe for us to try and so good I had to go back for thirds! I did a few modifications too after reading others' reviews. I increased the mushrooms, wine, Sherry and seasonings in turn with olive oil and dairy-free margarine (milk allergy) and added minced fresh garlic and chopped green onions. I used a resealable bag for coating the chicken and removed it after browning before sautéing the mushroom mixture and added the chicken back in. To make a thicker sauce, I mixed together a couple tablespoons of corn starch with cold water and added a little at a time at the end of the simmer until desired consistency was reached and served it up on a bed of spaghetti squash. Excellent and a keeper for sure! Thanks y'all!

Great basic chicken marsala. I read the other reviews and browned the chicken first, then thoroughly cooked the onions and mushrooms before putting it all back in the skillet to simmer with 3/4 C. marsala (no sherry). I like to make it with onions, garlic, and cream!

I wish I had not waited so long in life to start making these type of dishes. Made it for wife and I, we loved it. I cut way back on the butter, maybe 1/4 of what was called for, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and I took about 3 cloves of garlic and sliced it up thin to warm up in the butter n oil, huge positive. Cut the flour way back, used just enough for a thin layer but it thickened the wine gravy perfect.  Use a real Marsala Wine for $5.99 from Trader Joe's WOW!  Made mashed to serve with, used about 10 oz of baby bellas for 1 lb of chix breasts. Next time, double batch. Great staple dish to have in the rotation. Wife absolutely loved it, very satisfying meal. Will be making a lot.

This recipe was very easy and good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the Marsala wine and Sherry (not cooking wines).  I also dipped the chicken in eggs before coating in the flour and spices.  I removed the chicken while sauteing the onions and mushrooms in the wines and added a 1/4 cup of flour and spices to the sauce to thicken before adding the chicken back in.   I will continue to play with the sauce to perfect overall this was an excellent recipe and much easier than I thought.

2.5 * is a realistic rating, don't believe the hype in the number of "5-star" reviews.  This was just OK for a weeknight dinner.  Definitely NOT company worthy.  A genuine review, I made it as directed. While I liked the simplicity, I'll search for another recipe with a bit more flavour, I found this a bit disappointing apart from its ease.

Delish.  Doubled sauce and used loads of mush.  Browned chicken, removed it, sauteed mush then addeded some cream, reduced liquid, added chicken back and heated everything for a bit.  Yummy.  Served over angel hair with broccoli.

Delicious but I made some changes as others had indicated:
I used half the amount of oil/butter.  Added 2 minced shallots to pan when I added the mushrooms (I doubled the amount of mushrooms added).  Used all marsala wine, no sherry (added the two volumes together) and bought good quality marsala.  And to make it easier, I put all spices/flour into large freezer bag and added each flattened chicken breast to coat (like shake and bake).  Only added salt at the end, to taste.  Cooked the chicken a little longer than specified as I added 2-3 tbsp fresh chopped sage and 1/3 cup 18% cream.  Made it to serve 8 and was loved by all!

Oh. My. Gosh!!! My husband and I love Chicken Marsala, but I've always been too afraid to attempt it for the fear of messing it up. I decided to brave this simple recipe last night for the first time and it was unbelievable!!! I'm actually a really good cook but no matter what I make my husband always has a suggestion for the next time. This time his only suggestion was to make more! I listened to the reviews and instead of adding the cooking Sherry I increased the Marsala wine to 3/4 cup and added about a 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream to make it creamier. I also doubled the mushrooms. My only suggestion is to double the Marsala sauce. This will definitely become a staple in my household and the meal for having friends or family over!

I leave out the cooking sherry and use Oloroso from Jerez Spain,which is similar to Cream sherry and makes it a touch on the sweet side , but nevertheless delicious !

Did the cooking a bit differently.  Pounded the chicken so it was thin, then cooked as directed on one side.  When I flipped it, I put it towards one side of my (large) skillet, and added the mushrooms to the main part.  Salted those a bit and cooked them down for 8-10min on a lower temperature.  Then I added the wine and covered for another 8min or so.  I never get a good gravy from this, so I used 1T cornstarch mixed w/ about 1.5T water and poured in slowly until it started to thicken.  I didn't use the whole slurry - maybe 1/2 of it.  That gave me a great gravy.  Served w/ mashed red potatoes and roasted veggies (broccoli, onion, bell pepper).  Yum!

This was so quick and so easy and SO GOOD! I don't have the patience for pounding chicken so I simply sliced the breasts into medallions and threw everything into a large zip lock bag then just dumped it all into the butter and oil mix (also used coconut oil which worked fine).

Very very good, husband loved it.  I bought good marsala wine, doubled the sauce, served it over egg noodles, yum.  I added a little flour and salt pepper to the mushrooms before I added the liquids.  I also added some pasta water to the mixture as it was a little strong at first. Next time I will triple the sauce.

This recipe was awesome.  I did double the Butter, Marsala & Cooking Sherry to have extra sauce to drizzle over potatoes or pasta. I also added a little more salt.  It was a hit for my husband who orders this @ Olive Garden.

Really good. Made it as the recipe stated,  except like other reviewers, I doubled mushrooms and added some garlic, shallots and some cream while cooking. (Also ended up using a little corn starch slurry to thicken sauce up a bit)

My husband and I really liked this.  Since I was only  cooking for two people, I used only one fairly large chicken breast.  Once it was pounded thin it yielded four "cutlets".  I kept the sauce ratio the same because I intended to serve the dish with angel hair pasta.  Overall, t his was a very good dish and I will definitely be making it again.

Next time I make this I'm adding more pepper, oregano, and olives to the mix. Made as listed it was a little subtle for my palate.

This was so delicious. I used beef broth instead of marsala wine, then at the end I removed the chicken poured in a little more stock and some milk to make a cream sauce. I then used cornstarch and a bit of water to thicken it. Soooo good!

Delicious!! YES!! I tweaked the recipe a bit. I quadrupled everything in the recipe, except for the butter & olive oil. I omitted the cooking sherry, altogether. I substituted the sherry for white wine vinegar. I could not fine Marsala wine, so I used red cooking wine. I added 2 large onions & 3 cloves of garlic!! I also added cream of chicken soup. 

This is the order in which I cooked everything:
1). I browned the chicken. I set it aside.
2). Using the oil that was left in the pan, I sauteed the onions & the garlic. I added a LITTLE bit of red cooking wine to break up the stuff on the bottom of the pan. I let that cook until the onions were soft.
3). I added the rest of the red cooking wine & the white wine vinegar.
4). I added epic amounts of mushrooms (we are a mushroom-loving family). I allowed that to cook until the mushrooms were cooked.
5). I added some cream of chicken soup to thicken the sauce.
6). I added the chicken back into the pan & allowed everything to cook together for about ten minutes. 

THE WHOLE THING TURNED OUT PERFECTLY!!! :-)

Great - with no variation on the 1st attempt definitely a "make again" and again and again dish. When I feel like being adventurous with this... I'm going to try throwing in some garlic and onions.

This is the first chicken marsala I've ever made - I bought the right wine and sherry, doubled the amounts of those, and cooked it separately from the chicken.  Also added some cream, salt and pepper and cornstarch and doubled the mushrooms.  My husband raved and said we should open the expensive wine to have with this because it's gourmet and needs to be "added to the rotation."

This is a great easy recipe.  Very easy to make on a weeknight...I do all the prep and make side dishes and salads first, then as soon as this is done I am ready to serve.  I make this recipe ALMOST as is, with very minor changes, such as reducing the amount of oil and butter by half, using whole wheat flour, and more mushrooms if I have them.  It never disappoints and tastes like it was much harder to make than it was.

I actually made this exactly as the recipe calls for...amazing but true:-) I did remove the lid on the skillet and simmered for a bit to allow the sauce to reduce some. An excellent recipe...quick, easy and good. What's not to like?

So I tried this recipe and realized I really don't like mushrooms but my husband does. For some reason I couldn't get past the smell of this recipe to accept the taste. The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars is that my husband loved this recipe so much, he said it was perfect! If you are a little iffy about mushrooms then recipe isn't for you, it reeks of the smell.

I really don't get all these people that change the recipe/don't follow it, then say they don't like it?!? You ruined it then! I'm all for adapting the recipe for your own taste, but jeeeze. This recipe as is was very good.  Add more mushrooms, it's still good! I like this recipe was easy too...I would definitely make this again!

I followed a couple reviewers' suggestions and made a couple other changes, and this came out very yummy.  I reduced the oregano to 1/4 tsp., used 1/2 cup of sunflower oil (instead of 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil), and I didn't have Marsala (and didn't want to use cooking sherry), so I substituted 1/4 cup sweet red wine and 1/2 cup semi-sweet white wine.  I definitely recommend making this!

This was SO GOOD. Followed the recipe exactly with one exception: I had no marsala so I substituted white wine along with a couple teaspoons of brandy. The mushrooms soak up the yummy flavors. I served it over spaghetti and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Easy, fast, and really delicious.

Delish! Best chicken marsala I've had!  Wonderful recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I flatten the breast with a meat tenderizer before coating in the flour mixture.  I added 1/4 cup of heavy cream (half and half would work too) along with the wine and sherry.  I also used fresh oregano finely minced.  Yummy!  I served with linguine.

Excellent recipe! I added about 3 cloves of garlic while browning the chicken, DOUBLED the amount of sherry and Marsala wine, and added a dash (probably 1/4 cup) of chicken stock with the sherry and wine. Served over garlic mashed potatoes. Perfect. Will definitely be making again!

The taste is excellent, but I found it was lacking some bite.  A little bit bland as others pointed out.  It really needs a few more additions to be perfect.

Definitely double the mushrooms and the marsala wine. Since I did not have the room in my pan for both the mushrooms and chicken at the same time. I cooked the chicken first then place the pieces on a cookie sheet and kept them warm on a low temperature in the oven. Then cooked the mushrooms in the sauce until done. Plated the chicken. Ladled the sauce/mushrooms over the chicken.

I made this for the first time last night. My husband and I love it. The smell of the sherry with the Marsala wine was delishhhhh.. I did feel it was missing something. Next time I might add a splash of red or white wine. Salt and pepper to taste. I also added 2 garlic gloves and 1/2 onion. Wouldn't  mind more of the two either.... Next time I might  leave the flower out. As I read on a review it cooked just fine with out. No need to add cornstarch to mine. It was just perfect.

This recipe was really great! I made it as instructed and it was very simple. The hubby also loved it and I've made two other versions before that he did not. Highly recommended! I made mine with green beans and roasted red potatoes. I will definitely make again!

My entire family loved it! It was so easy for something so delicious! When I don't have sherry I just add extra marsala and it's still amazing! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone!---you don't have to be an expert in the kitchen to make this one.

Winner winner chicken dinner! Finally something different to do with chicken breast that didn't require a long grocery list. It turned out restaurant-worthy delicious. Served the chicken and sauce on top of a bed of mashed potatoes. Family loved it.

The whole family loved it. The only adjustment that I made on the second time I made it was I added more mushrooms. The only complaint I got after this from my daughter was that I still needed more mushrooms.

Delicious! My few changes: I used almost 2cups of baby Bella mushrooms. I was making an asparagus dish on the side that called for bacon sprinkled on it, so - not wanting to be wasteful- I used the same pan, with the leftover bacon fat instead of butter. I cooked the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side until just done & then set it aside. I cooked the mushrooms in the remaining bit of bacon fat & added the Marsala wine. I skipped the sherry. I wish I had more sauce & next time I will certainly double it somehow. After it cooked down just a little, I spooned it over the chicken. Every one loved it, including a 12 yr old & 92 yr old. Mmmmmm.

Wow! I tried this recipe about a month ago and it turned out so amazing! My boyfriend went on and on about this dish. He didn't stop. He said it was one of his favorites. I changed it up a little bit. I used extra Marsala and Sherry wine and added cornstarch and water to make the sauce thick so I could pour it over angel hair pasta. I also used a whole container of mushrooms around 2 1/2 cups maybe. It turned out amazing! We both loved it! I also simmered the sauce and the chicken and mushrooms for about 25 minutes. It made the chicken melt in your mouth plus it absorbs some of the strong wine taste to which leaves you with a rich, tangy sauce. Awesome recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out perfectly tender.  Sauce and mushrooms were delicious.  I used fresh mushrooms and chilled the floured chicken for an hour or so before frying.  I would double the Marsala and sherry next time to make more sauce for pasta.

This is a delicious, very quick to prepare entrée that has become a family favorite.  The recipe is great the as is but I did add a couple of personal twists.  I often use boneless thighs instead of breast meat and they work well in this recipe.  I also generally substitute regular sherry for the cooking sherry.  Neither of these changes fundamentally change the original recipe they're just personal preferences.

I made this recipe for my fathers birthday. Except I tripled the recipe! I was cooking for 7 people and I tweaked the recipe a bit. I didn't have time to run to the store so I couldn't make the recipe with cooking sherry. I just used more Marsala wine, but about half the amount. I also added extra green herbs to the flour seasonings. That's about all I did. I didn't know before I made it that my dad didn't even like chicken marsala. he was surprised when he found that he actually liked this recipe for it. He said he was truly impressed with how good they turned out.

I followed most of the recipe, but I seasoned the chicken first with granulated garlic, kosher salt, garlic salt , and pepper. I also added roasted garlic and a bit of sugar to the sauce. Delish!

I LOVE this. It's quick, easy and tasty. I halve the butter and oil and double the mushrooms and sauce. I freeze the chicken till it's semi-firm and slice fairly thinly. I also use a large Ziploc to cover with flour. Makes cleanup easy.

The family loved this! Said it was better than going out to eat! Doubled the mushrooms and chopped up a small yellow onion to go in! Perfection! Like some of the other reviewers have said, don't use wine you wouldn't drink. Found a huge bottle at my local liquor store for 8.99 and got 2 dinners out of it!

OMG, This recipe is AWESOME!! I have frequently enjoyed Chicken Marsala in Italian restaurants, but I just assumed it would be an ordeal to make it myself. I swear, this recipe is so quick & easy, you will be totally amazed. My husband and I have each made it several times, for ourselves and for guests as well. The mouth watering aroma as it cooks will have everyone thinking you're a total gourmet!  A few minor things we've tweaked to make it even better; we add a little crushed garlic to the oil & butter mixture just before placing the chicken in to brown. Next, we use extra Marsala & Sherry, (always with the 2:1 ratio), because we like extra sauce. We wait to add the mushrooms until the last time we turn the chicken so that they don't become overcooked. Finally, we whisk in a little flour during the last few minutes of cooking to thicken up the sauce and then serve this delicious dish over angel hair pasta. Add a salad & a bottle of wine, and you're all set. Be prepared for the compliments. Totally yummy.

Delicious!!!!  And super easy to make.  I kept recipe exactly as is and it was wonderful.  I may decrease the amount of oil/butter next time, but I think it was just b/c I had smaller pieces of chicken that just seemed a bit much oil/butter for them.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for my husband who is not a fan of chicken Marsala.  All I could hear was, "yum, mmmm, mmmm.  He had a second helping  and ended up just loving it.  I definitely will be making this one again.  The only suggestion I have would be to double the amount of sauce and mushrooms.

I really loved this recipe, but I added way more mushrooms than the recipe called for.  I cooked my chicken first and set it aside.  I doubled the butter and oil and then added a ton of mushrooms without measuring.  I used baby bellas and white mushrooms.  I kept the wine as is and it turned out wonderful

I love chicken marsala and can't believe how quick and easy it was to make. Only thing I did different was add a few tablespoons of cream at the end and used a splash of slurry (cornstarch and water)to tighten it up to top my pasta. Deliciousness!

I made this for my family and it was just okay.  I should have bought the sweet fine marsala.  I had bought the dry version.  I enjoy colorful dishes and this was too monochromal.  Ill try the Florentine version next time with sweet marsala.

We really like Chicken Marsala but had never cooked it at home.  This recipe turned out really good!  It was like eating at a restaurant.  We served it with Olive oil and herb pasta along with Asparagus.  The only thing I noticed was that there was only -just- enough sauce.  Maybe next time I'll increase it a bit.  It could just be that we smothered our chicken, ha-ha.  Give it a shot, you shouldn't be disappointed.

Made this last night and it was one of the best dishes I have ever made. The only thing I did was add a little heavy whipping cream and a dash of flour to thicken the sauce before adding the chicken back in as other reviewers had suggested. I served the sauce and chicken over capellini pasta. Definitely a dish I will make again and again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Definitely a keeper recipe!  My husband really liked it and I was worried about what he'd think.  I followed the advice from the helpful reviewers: saute with 2-3 fresh, minced garlic cloves, double the sauce, add onion, use good Marsala wine and add a little heavy whipping cream and chicken broth to make the sauce richer.  I served it with instant garlic and parmesan mashed potatoes and steamed veggies--made for a quick, easy and delicious weeknight dinner!

OMG!!!  This was great.  My husband went back for more!  I did follow some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I doubled the sauce..  actually using 2 whole cups of Marsala and no sherry.  I added a bunch of mushrooms and used some minced garlic out of a jar because that is what I had on hand.  

The marsala was from a wine and spirits store, not what you buy in the grocery store.  I used the real thing.  I also removed the chicken from the pan, sautéed the garlic and mushrooms, returned the chicken to the pan.  I used some cornstarch to thicken it a little and heavy cream.

I served the chicken with angel hair pasta and finished off the meal with a pan-fried asparagus recipe from this site.  No left overs with the exception of the little bit I put away in a container to take to work tomorrow before I served dinner.

Ok so this is definitely a very easy recipe, followed it exactly besides doubing the sauce/mushrooms. Also added some heavy cream and chicken broth. For some reason I didn't find the dish very tasteful. I did skip out on the sherry entirely because I didn't have any, which might have been the difference. I will try again!

This recipe is easy and tastes great. All I did differently was to cut the chicken into bite size chunks2 before cooking it. Each morsel was coated and covered with sauce. Mmm good!

This was superb! Absolutely fine dining quality!  I doubled the recipe and it came out perfect. In fact I may actually triple the sauce next time to have more for the noodles and bread to soak up.   I read the directions and watched the video.  I followed the advise of the video and removed the chicken to saute the mushrooms first, then added the Marsala and sherry, etc.  I served this over angel hair pasta with a side of ratatouille.  We will definitely be making this again!

My BF and I made this last night.  He has zero cooking experience.  I thought this recipe would show him good basic techniques:  preparing the chicken, dredging, pan sauté, deglazing, etc.  And then, we shared this wonderful meal!  We did add onions in with the mushrooms, extra marsala, removed the breasts while we prepared the sauce.  Tiny splash of cream at the end, and dab of butter.  Served it with smashed yellow potatoes.  My only regret is that it is all gone.  We could eat it every day.  Absolutely restaurant quality.  Oh, no cooking sherry in this house, only real sherry.  It is inexpensive, it keeps, is great to have on hand, useful in all sorts of recipes.

I have made this many times. Excellent, better than most restaurants. I can no longer order this dish out, it's so much better made at home. I double the recipe to make twice as much Marsala sauce as it's so delicious and we like extra sauce.

I made this recipe for a casual game night with friends. Everyone loved it.  My only recommendation is to possibly add more mushrooms to it as it seemed a little thin on those.  Other than that, it was quick and easy to make, and very, very tasty!

I used the Kroger brand cooking sherry and krogers cooking Marsala wine. The taste is salty/winer. Next time I'm going for the true Marsala drinking wine

This is the easiest and most flavorful recipe! A favorite in my family we double the mushrooms, sherry and Marsala wine because we like to add the gravy to our mashed potatoes! Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing!

Ok... I followed it to the T except I had to use all marsala instead of sherry, because I thought I could find sherry at the grocery store and didn't want to go back to the package store where I got the marsala when I couldn't find the sherry... Sheer laziness, I know. Still delicious. The sauce was kind of blah after the chicken was cooked. Good, but... it could be better, so I chopped up a bell pepper and a small onion and threw it in along with some heavy whipping cream and OMG... It was so amazing. I am eating leftovers for breakfast... That good. I have absolutely no italian in me, so... sorry if this addendum to the recipe offends the sensibilities of true italian cookers, but it was so yummy. :)

Awesome!  I didn't add the sherry and I used Marsala wine that you get in the vinegar and ketchup section in the grocery store. I also added half a bunch of chopped green onions to the mushrooms......Everyone loved this including my picky eater son.  Hubby said it was Gourmet and restaurant quality! Will add to my rotation for sure!!!

Loved this recipe.  I did 3/4 cup of Marsala and omitted the sherry.  I made this in a cast iron skillet, adding twice the mushrooms and a bit of heavy cream at the end.  I served this over pasta... My very picky child loved it.  My husband loved it.  And I loved it.  This tastes so good, it's perfect for special occasions, and so easy you can make it on the fly, and make a boring day special!

This is delicious!  So simple yet elegant.  I used brown rice flour to dredge the chicken - it's gluten free but the added benefit is that it makes the chicken almost silky.  Baby Bellas hold up nicely and adding a few sprigs of fresh thyme as the sauce simmers really adds dimension.  I'm 100% German but my Italian husband said, are you sure you're not Italian?  Definitely a keeper -- thank you, Lisa!!!

Wonderful! I use this recipe for my catering and het rave reviews. Only thing I do differently is add a little cream for more body in the broth and I don't use the sherry just the marsala and cook it long enough for the alcohol to burn off.

This was outstanding.  I followed recipe exact.  I would suggest that you get the chicken a crispier when browning.... I did not do that and the chicken was a little soggy, but the overall flavor made up for it in the end.  Keeper!

This is wonderful! I had to use all sherry instead of sherry and wine, but the substitution was fine. It turned out GREAT! This is a new family recipe that everybody-including my picky teenage daughters- LOVED! Thanks!

If I could change this recipe, I'd double the sauce!  It was fantastic!  I didn't have sherry, so I used all Marsala, used about 1 1/2 cups to get more sauce.  I wondered what this would be like without cream, it was great.  We are gluten free.  Used gluten free flour.  Served with mashed potatoes.   My family loved it.  Thanks for posting!

I made this last night for my wife's birthday and it was a huge hit!!!  I did make a couple tweaks to the recipe though.  I added Heavy Whipping Cream to the sauce to make it a cream sauce.  I also trippled the mushrooms I used portabellas and added shallots as well.  Something else I tried was I just took out the sherry and used all marsala wine.  We also paired the meal with oven roasted asparagus.  But like I said this meal was a huge success!!!

Made this last night and the family loved it.  I followed some reviewers' suggestions and added garlic to the pan and omitted the sherry.  I just increased the Marsala to 3/4 c.  I also sprinkled garlic salt on the chicken breasts before flouring and the flavor was great - not bland at all.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the changes.

I followed the recipe exactly. Amazing! the only changes i'll make next time is brown it more on the first side. Then i'll uncover it a bit sooner to help thicken the sauce more or i'll pull the chicken out and continue to thicken sauce.

I tried this recipe and it would have been wonderful, EXCEPT put the cooking sherry back in the cabinet. It is WAY too overpowering when used with the Marsala wine. Use a little more Marsala if you want to, but LEAVE THE COOKING SHERRY OUT! It pretty much ruined an otherwise wonderful-tasting chicken dish.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I changed was how I cooked the chicken. I dipped into flour, then egg, and then I put them into italian breadcrumb. This was sooo yummy!! My husband says its his favorite meal now!

This was a great recipe! I just added chicken stock instead of the sherry and used moscato (whatever wine I had in the house). It was a super easy and super quick meal. I served with mashed potatoes. 1 thing I would do is get thin pieces of chicken or cut them in half so they cook all the way through. YUM!

Loved it! I tripled wine and sherry, used 1 lb of mushrooms and added the remaining flour mixture to sauce to thicken it. Ended up being delicious.

I've got VERY picky eaters, and am kind of a wine snob, so I didn't think it would work (I could only fine Marsala at the grocery store - ack! - but it was DELICIOUS!  They were licking the bottom of the pan :)  I had to adjust a little based on what I had on hand, and even imperfectly it was good - next time I'm going to stick to the recipe and I'm sure it will be even better!  I didn't have mushrooms, and as another reviewer mentioned, I browned the chicken in the pan (I only had thighs not breasts), then transferred to a baking dish to finish at 375 for 15 min.  I had to use merlot instead of sherry, would have been better with sherry!  I tripled the sauce...for a family pack of boneless thighs, fed my 5 big eaters just fine.

I made this recipe and it came out delicious.  I added a little more marsala and I sautéed onions and mushrooms separate from the chicken, then later added the chicken so the onions would be soft.  It was delicious and my boyfriend loved it as well.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.

Sometimes I make this dish with chicken tenders pounded thin. I saute my mushrooms first--sometimes days in advance. I buy those 1.5 pound boxes of 'shrooms at Costco, saute them, and they keep for weeks in the fridge. Then they're ready to add to sauces, omelettes, or any recipe that calls for mushrooms. I like to serve my Chicken Marsala with pasta, so I need lots of sauce. I add a can of chicken stock to the pan at the end, and lightly thicken it with just a little bit of flour.

Any recipe that incorporates not one, but two wines, is a sure-fire winner in my book!  This was a super-fast & easy version of a classic, fit the bill perfectly last night.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

Cooking with Marsala wine makes an any night meal special. I already have one out of this world Chicken Marsala recipe, but came across this one the other day. Wanted to try it since it's easy. Sooo very disappointed!!  Easy does not make up for a VERY BLAND taste.

I thought this recipe was great and SUPER quick and easy!  What a perfect weekday dinner!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and removed the chicken while cooking the sauce, doubled the sauce, and added a splash of whole milk.  I served it over cavatappi noodles - it was perfect!  The hubby liked it as well - and I know I've done an exceptionally good job when he doesn't need the Sriracha! Thanks for a keeper!

I made Chicken Marsala a couple months ago for my BF and his mom, and lets just say she continues to say how delicious it was, she went to a restaurant and ordered chicken marsala and said the one I made came out so much better than the restaurant, its easy to make, and comes out soo delicious, we paired it up with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

5 stars for sure!

This was very good. After I read some of the reviews, it seemed a lot of people liked more sauce. I took 1 chicken breast, trimmed off all fat and cut it in half. I pounded it out to about ¼ of an inch. Mixed Flour salt pepper and oregano in a bowl and coated the chicken. I melted 1 table spoon of butter and added 1 tablespoon of Olive oil in a pan over medium heat, browned the chicken on both sides. Took the chicken out of the pan and added Marsala, Sherry and mushrooms. The sauce turned brown and I put the chicken back in the pan to warm up. This was a very simple recipe to follow. 
Tips 
Cover the pan when sautéing the mushrooms with the chicken in the final steps.
To thicken the sauce I used a whipping cream.

Great Chicken Marsala recipe.  I Didn't change any ingredients, just tripled the marsala wine, sherry and mushrooms because I love the sauce.  I also thickened the sauce by mixing 1 tbsp of cornstarch to 1 tbsp of marsala wine and mixing that in at the very end after the chicken breasts have been removed.  I butterfly the chicken breasts instead of pounding them out.  Just easier and faster that way.

I made a couple of changes,  I added twice as many mushrooms, and after I cooked the chicken and mushrooms,I removed some of the oil (about 2 tablespoons) before adding the wines.  It was ready in less than 30 minutes, and it tastes like an elegant expensive dish!!!  I will be making it often!!

This is the very best chicken marsala I have ever had.  I made for an in-law event and everyone loved it!

No changes at all.  I've made it ahead of time  ( the day before even ) and warmed it in the oven before serving.  Excellent!!!

This recipe is very good and made a tasty dinner.  I read through some of the reviews before I made it, and I agree that it needed more sauce.  I browned the chicken on both sides, removed it from the pan, then added a sliced onion, sliced mushrooms, and a little garlic along with the wines.  To make a little more sauce, I added a cup of chicken broth with a little flour added to thicken just a bit.  Then I added the chicken back into the pan and put it in the oven for about 20 minutes to finish cooking while I prepared some rice and vegetables.  My husband loved it and took leftovers to work today.

First time making this tonight.  After reading the reviews, I incorporated ome of the suggestions, ie. more mushrooms, heavy whipping cream, taking the chicken out, etc.  This was absolutely the bomb!! My wife and mom said this was a keeper and to add into the rotation.  Thanks Lisa!!

I have made this 3 or 4 times now and my husband and I love it.  I surprised him tonight by making it and he was very happy!  I try many new recipes and very few I make twice. It is definitely a lighter version of Marsala but it is a splurge for my weight watcher diet. I used Baby Bella mushrooms this time around and it was even better than before.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas.

Very tasty!  The spouse loved it too, and he's not a big chicken fan.  I've always wanted to try and make this, finally did, and was not disappointed!  I didn't flatten the chicken, so it took a little longer to cook, but it was still delicious.

I love this recipe.  Usually with dinner I like to have fruits and veggies as well, so when I make this dish I throw green beans into the skillet with the chicken and mushrooms for the last 10 minutes.  It works well with peas too, but I only put them in for 5 minutes.

I loved this! It was very easy. I didn't have mushrooms and it was still fabulous. My 11-year old daughter even liked it and she is an extremely picky eater. Hooray!!

Excellent idea to tenderize the chicken. Use less oil next time.  The gravy will be less oily.

If I make this recipe again I'll probably use half the butter and oil. This was just too much. I'll also nix the mushrooms. Normally I like mushrooms in dishes but they didn't take the marsala flavor too well.

Excellent recipe, and easily adapted to the ingredients in your cupboard. I was out of white wine and sherry. I subbed red for white wine, and burgundy wine for sherry. I added a Italian seasoning, a little minced garlic, and onion powder to taste. The end result was super delicious. I'll make extra sauce next time. The mushrooms could have been a meal in themselves. The hubby took the leftovers for lunch. He left for work this morning saying-"I can't wait for lunch."

I've made this twice now.  I followed directions exactly the first time and we really enjoyed it.  The second time I followed other reviewers advice and added more mushrooms, light cream,garlic and a thickening agent.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the classy, quick recipe!

My husband and I really loved this recipe. It's quick and easy... perfect for a quick weekday meal. It's also yummy enough to serve to guests.

I did doctor it a little. I added extra salt and pepper to the flour mixture and I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the oil/butter before I cooked the chicken. 

I served it over pasta. Next time I'm going to make extra sauce so there is extra for the pasta. YUM!

This was excellent.  The chicken was very moist and tasty.  I started with thin sliced chicken breast fillets and pounded them thin.  Instead of the oregano, I used 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and I used 3/4 cup sweet Marsala and eliminated the cooking sherry.  I also added chopped green onions during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I made 6 chicken breasts, and browned them two at a time, because my pan wasn't large enough for all of them.  I put them aside on a plate, and cooked the mushrooms down a bit before adding the wine and placing the chicken breasts on top.  Then, I covered the pan and cooked them for 5 minutes.  I turned the chicken breasts over, and added the chopped green onions, and cooked for another 5 minutes.  My family loved it!

I love this recipe!  It's so fast and easy and delicious.  My chicken breasts were quite thick so I slice them in half before pounding them to 1/4 inch thickness.  I put just a little extra oregano in the flour mix, maybe 3/4 tsp.  I used a mixture of mushrooms, shitake, crimini and buttons.  I served it with garlic smashed potatoes and tender crisp broccoli.  Yummy, yummy!  But alas and alack, there were no leftovers :(.

I triple the sauce, double the mushroom, add sauteed garlic and onion to it. At the end, I add some cornstarch with water, thicken up the sauce and serve with pasta. Great flavor.

I've tried this recipe a few times, and because we don't have expensive marsala wine, I've modified it.  I marinated the chicken breasts in marsala cooking wine and white cooking wine for about 2 hours, seasoned the breasts with some salt and pepper.  This helped the flour mixture stick and give the coating a nice consistency when it browned.  This also helps the sauce thicken.  I used entirely marsala cooking wine (instead of the sherry), and added 1 tbs of sugar to the sauce.  Next time, I will make even more sauce (maybe 1.5 the suggested amount).  Marinating the meat helped bring out the flavor since the marsala at the store isn't very rich.  Top with some parsley and shredded parmesan reggiano.

I made this one evening for my boyfriend and he was incredibly impressed!  We both work full-time, so I really liked how quick, easy, and delicious this recipe is!  The chicken was so tender and the sauce was amazing!  I doubled the marsala and sherry and I doubled the mushrooms.  I also added some half and half to make the sauce thicker and creamier.  I was so impressed with how sophisticated this recipe tastes!  I will definitely cook this for company one day.

Delicious! Served over brown rice. Used chicken broth instead of cooking sherry. SO tender! Made with a side of lemon herb asparagus/mushroom/broccoli stir-fry.

I've made this before using a different recipe, but the basic flavor of this was great. It had too much butter for my taste and I would use only the 4 tbls of olive oil and maybe put one pat of butter in to finish the sauce. I used baby bellos and made it with Broccoil with Garlic Butter Nuts from this site. Great dinner. Thanks for posting it.

Delicious, easy and quick.  Not a lot of ingredients required (though the Marsala wine is a touch pricey).  I let the sauce reduce to be a bit thicker, and may try adding cornstarch to thicken it next time.  Thicker chicken breasts will require more cooking time.

This was so easy to make and delicious. I doubled the wine and sherry and reduced it first to get a milder wine flavor, then I added the remainder ingredients.  I also added more mushrooms because my family loves them.

Very simple with great flavor!  I did double the "sauce" to put over pasta, althought next time I would at least triple it.  Also tripled the mushrooms.  Will definatly make again.

My only change is to prepare and drain fresh linguini, place the cooked linguini into the pan with chicken, mushrooms, Marsala n sheree, letting the noodles absorb all the flavors and add 2 big handfulls of baby spinach. Cover 2 minutes until wilted (bring heat down to med/low), then stir and serve. 
This is how they do it in The South.

Easy, fast, delicious.  I added a bit more liquid than the recipe stated, and used rice flour--doubled the recipe in two pans and had raves from all 8 who ate it.  Thx.

This came out generally well, but a few notes:  I tried adding garlic while I was cooking the chicken (per another review), but it ended up burning and kind of making a mess.  If you want to put the sauce over pasta, you're going to have to cook it down A LOT, and you're going to want to make WAY more sauce than the recipe calls for.  I ended up using practically the whole bottle of marsala wine, and I used a lot more mushrooms.  The sauce came out well.  I think next time I will use oil instead of butter to cook the chicken for health reasons.

I have a couple who comes to dinner once a week, and each week I am going to make a new recipe to share with thelm.  This week it was Chicken Marsala and That Amazing Salad!!!  
This Chicken Marsala was delightful...  delicious... and no work at all to create.  Everyone raved about it as we chatted about my new allrecipes membership.  They know they will have something new each week that I have not made before... What an exciting way to treat them and myself with new and womderful food choices.  Thanks, allrecipes!!!

An easy chicken marsala recipe. All the ingredients I could purchase at my local grocery store. Cooks up exactly as recipe calls for; chicken is very tender. My husband loved it with rice and veggies on the side. If you like chicken marsala, then you should try this recipe.

I added an onion and used 2 large portabella caps with 2 blsl breasts.  Served with wilted spinach and a little pasta with red sauce on the side. Skipped the dredging and used Wondra at the end on the reduced sauce, which was perfect since I just wanted sauce on chicken and mushrooms.

My husband, son and I thought this recipe was very good.  I used crimini mushrooms and added an extra cup.  I also used 6 breast halves instead of 4 (we like to EAT!).  I also used fresh ground white pepper instead of black.

Nice dish.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms, and bf isn't a fan of wine, but he was the one who insisted on buying Marsala wine . . .oh, 5 years ago.  I just remembered this was in the cabinet!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so used a small can of them . . . I don't think I used enouhg; should have used two.  I made a slurry to thicken this up; I really wish I hadn't, bc I wasn't really thrilled with it that way. I did double the wine and am glad I did, though. I served it over spaghetti and gnocchi pasta; very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for the first time and it was fantastic.  I have since read the reviews and realized I never pounded the chicken breasts.  Not sure what that does because it tasted delicious.  I don't eat mushrooms but my husband does and it didn't seem to make that many.  I would double or triple the mushrooms next time.  Cooking sherry wasn't at hand so I skipped it.  One reviewer said the butter wasn't really necessary, I would tend to agree but it did seem to make a nice thin sauce.  Thickening with heavy cream and cornstarch sound good too but that would just add calories.  Any marsala I've ever eaten in a restaurant came with a thin sauce not a heavy cream like sauce.  Basic is better!!

The way this is cooked leaves the breading on the chicken soggy and completely unappetizing. My kids took one bite and both said "eeewww!" I usually love chicken marsala, its one of my favorite dishes in fact, but this was just gross. Soggy breading, and I had to simmer covered for almost 2-3x as long to soften the mushrooms. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 only because my husband said it "wasn't too bad." However, I think he was only trying to be nice.

Really good with pheasant as well.  Have made several times....marsala flavor is a great compliment to the game bird.  I like to add a bit more butter and oil initially for this recipe regardless of the meat used.

This was delicious.  I added to the recipe proportions and used a whole chicken I had and cut up (deboned the breast and cut into smaller parts, but used the legs and wings). It was so good over rice and with salad.

This recipe was super delicious!!! I made this for the first time with people over and the only adjustment I made was that I doubled the mushrooms, Marsala wine, and cooking sherry. It turned out great, served with mashed potatoes. Will definitely make it again! :)

So easy and sooooo good!  After the first try, I cut down on the marsala to 1/4 c and add some white wine to make up the volume.  Served with egg noodles or with Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice, it's a winner, for family or for company.  Made it last time with Crimini mushrooms (always use extra mushrooms) and some leftover Portabella stems.  Yummmm.

Delicious!  I made it lighter by cutting the amount of olive oil and butter in half and I didn't notice the difference.  I used twice as much wine and sherry and a whole container of portobello mushrooms to make a  lot of sauce to cover the mashed potatoes I served with it.  I also finished the sauce by whisking together a little water and flour adding it to the sauce at the end to make it more gravy-like.  I had lots of compliments on dinner from my friends!

recipe makes a great base!  I added some garlic, chicken broth, a little cornstarch mixture and a splash of heavy cream at the end.  Fabulous!!  I really liked the mixture of the marsala and sherry in this recipe. I only had sweet Marsala and the sherry toned it down a bit.  Made this again...  I did not put the cornstarch mixture just cooked juices down a little more and was as good as the first time I made it!

A very good chicken marsala. The only change that I had to make was substitute white pepper for black which I am allergic to. I also add fresh garlic most of the time. I found that using a sharp knife to cut horizontal slices made the chicken cook quickly and allowed the flavors to get aquainted in no time. Add lots of mushrooms and wine since it is so delish that you will want a lot. I have made this recipe many times and everyone raves about the flavor.

This recipe was a revelation to me...where have I been?? Loved it! I plan to use this very simple recipe the next time I have guests over (they have to like mushrooms). I made mashed potatoes and green beans as side dishes, and it was delicious and a wonderful comfort meal. Thank you!

Delicious recipe. I ended up adding 1/2 c extra mushrooms, doubled the oregano and black pepper and adding a little flour to the sherry/marsala mixture to thicken it a little bit. It was a hit with all the kids, and that's rare!

One Skillet Masterpiece!  We modified slightly to our taste.  Doubled the Mushrooms at the beginning and added 1 Cup of Heavy Whipping Cream at the end.
Finally, we tossed the Angel Hair Pasta with Infused Basil Olive Oil.  I actually think Egg Noodles would work just as good..but didn't make it with Egg Noodles, but will next time.
Followed up with the Steamed Broccoli as the original recipe states and WOW...we even have some leftovers.

This was quick and easy and I had all ingredients on hand. Taste was good, not great for us. Had to thicken the sauce with flour, way too runny otherwise.

Loved it and so did everyone else.  I will be married 20 years next week and my husband never really liked my chicken Marsala. Today when I told him I made it for supper he made a face. I then told him I had a new recipe. He said he didn't like it but that he Loved it! and so did the kids. I did add some half and half to the wine and mushrooms , I all so put two cloves of garlic in with the butter and oil. After the chicken was done cooking I removed the chicken from the pan and then added mushrooms and wine. Cooked the mushrooms a bit added half and half then return the chicken to the pan. Thank you so much for sharing this it is worth its wait in gold

This is an excellent recipe and I use it all the time.  I like my sauce a little thicker so I sometimes add a cornstarch slurry to the sauce because the flour on chicken is not enough to thicken.  Also if you can get a hold of real marsala wine and not the store bought one the dish will be SUPERB!  Only issue I have is the butter separating from the wines. and Im constantly having to try to mix the sauce.

I made this and must have used the wrong Marsala wine, it wasn't cheap it was expensive but was "sweet Marsala". Floiro (sp) brand so I am asking what BRAND to use. It was very bitter and very hard to eat. Please if reviewers could include what brand of Marsala they used since that seems to be key!!!! I am not going to buy 10 different kinds.

Pretty good, didn't have much sauce after cooking the chicken, so I will have to make some adjustments next time. I didn't feel the need to pound out the chicken either

Who knew my favorite Italian recipe was so easy to make at home?!  This is delicious!  I more than double the mushrooms & in turn increase the butter, oil, marsala & sherry just a bit.  SO. GOOD.

Great, easy recipe.  I doubled the the wine, sherry and mushrooms just to have more sauce and we love the mushrooms.  I made mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus with the chicken for a wonderful dinner.

It was ok... Kind of bland, I think onion may add a bit of savor. The left overs were not eaten. That never happens in my house.

I love this recipe - super easy and has great flavor. My only change is to use 3/4 cup of Marsala instead of 1/2 cup Marsala and 1/4 cup sherry. Delicious!

I found this recipe bland and the sauce watery. I even added garlic as suggested and even tried some cornstarch at the end to no avail. Not like I have in the restaurant at all.

Made trying to follow recipe, used 3/4 c Marsala cooking wine and no sherry and no oregano (didn't have any italian spice..I know, shame on me!)  It was good and chicken was tender.  Wasn't restaurant quality but look forward to trying again.

This was very good. I couldn't get the bread crumbs to stick to the chicken as well as the photos but it's more likely due to my lack of experience. Still tasted great and I would make them again.

Great easy quick recipe! My husband said it tasted exactly like restaurant CM! I doubled the sauce by doubling the butter/oil/mushrooms/marasala/sherry, but the sauce was so good I wished there was more. Next time I will triple.   Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a great recipe...To get more sauce I up it to 1 cup Marsala Wine and 1/2 cup Sherry.  You can also add capers and broccoli and then put it over couscous or pasta...

I wasn't crazy about this, I never had chicken marsala before. I don't think I liked the marsala flavor. Also the coating on the chicken became soggy after cooking it in the wine.

AWESOME!  I finished it and thought to myself "WOW!  I didn't know I was this good of a cook!  :)"  Super easy recipe too.  I took the advice of others and added heavy whipping cream to the marsala wine to make a creamy sauce and served it over noodles.  Awesome!  My 3 year old said "mmmmmm thanks for making such a licious (delicious) supper for us mom" and had 3 servings of it!

So good, thanks for the recipe.  This is now a new family favorite.  I doubled the sauce and I think next time I will quadruple the sauce there wasn't any left.  I added about a 1/4 c cream it was good without it but I like creamy marsala.  Will make again very soon.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I do differently is making it gluten free with Pamela's Gluten free Pancake and baking mix in place of the flour.  I also tried it with both the wine and sherry called for but I now like it better substituting a sweet white wine in place of the wine and sherry.   The original marsala wine and sherry were a little strong for me.

Fabulous dish! It is very important to make sure you DOUBLE THE SAUCE. It is so delicious and the recipe makes an amount that just teases everyone. I used 1 cup of Marsala, 1 cup sherry, 2 cups of mushrooms (with the additional butter and olive oil for sauteing) plus gave it half a cup of heavy cream for a Marsala cream sauce. A real people-pleaser, this one!

This is my go-to recipe for chicken marsala. I've made it for several friends and family members and they always ask for the recipe. It's time consuming, but easy to make. There's nothing I change about this recipe other than maybe add more or less mushrooms based on preference of my guests.

one of my favorite dinners and a great chicken recipe!  sauce is a little thin, but i like that...wish it made a little more, though.  i double the mushrooms and add crushed garlic to the butter before cooking the chicken.  it is SO good and perfect over pasta!  thanks for sharing lisa ;)

This has been my family's go-to Marsala recipe for years. My mom made this for our pre-prom dinner party when I was in high school, and I make it for my husband now. I've always made it as-is and think it's perfect. Don't forget to season the chicken with salt and pepper before dredging. It really makes a difference.

Delicious! I have tried several other recipes and like this one the best so far. I only had cooking wine, but it was still fantastic. I cooked the chicken, then put it in the oven to stay warm while i sauteed the crimini shrooms with some minced garlic. I doubled the sauce.  and added a little chicken broth and a cornstarch slurry to thicken.

Wondefful recipe! I did change just a few things according to other's reviews. I did sauté garlic first before adding chicken. I also doubled the sauce but next time I will quadruple it so there will be enough to put over pasta. My husband and I love sauce. Otherwise, I cooked it exactly as written, leaving the chicken in while mushrooms cooked. I think this added more flavor to the chicken. I also don't think it needs any extra flour to the sauce. The sauce was thick enough without it.

The wine was overpowering. I felt like it didn't really cook out. I made this for a family dinner and I just didn't feel right about giving it to my kids because the alcohol flavor was so strong. My husband and I did enjoy it but too strong for kids in my opinion.

I did everything as directed but it came out somewhat greasy. It wasn't as good as I was expecting. I've been working in an Italian restaurant a few years ago and this didn't taste anything like their marsala. I'm somewhat disappointed :(

The sauce is a little thin for my taste, so I would add a little flour or cornstarch next time.  Also, I didn't use drinking wines/sherry because we don't typically drink them so I bought small bottles of the cooking variety.  It was a little off-tasting, but still yummy.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good!  Very easy!  I made this while home alone with an infant and a toddler (never easy to cook in this scenario).  If I can do it, anyone can.  Served it over egg noodles and it was delish.

I left out the mushrooms and the sherry, added a 1/2 cup of heavy cream at the same time as the marsala wine. By far one of my favorite chicken dishes of all time!

Made it 2X.  Easy and came out great.  My family of picky eaters enjoyed it.  I used Gluten Free bread crumbs w/ italian spice mix as the coating.  Worked well.

Had a really good flavor, but more time consuming than I'm used to.  This would be a good weekend dinner, but not during the week (like I tried)...

This is the recipe I always have used.  The ONLY thing I do different because I am not a mushroom fan is I use sauteed onions instead which adds a great new flavor dimension to the already wonderful marsala sauce

I have made this 2x in the past month.  Yesterday I made it for someone who is always saying they do not like chicken breast.  All I can say is she will not be saying that again.  This is delicious.  I served it over pasta. It was a big hit.  Will be making it again & again.  The only change I made was I made a marinade for the chicken breasts.

This is a yummy recipe.  My husband loved it and thought it was better than restaurant versions because it didn't have sooo many seasonings going on but I thought it could use a little more.  The chicken was very moist cooking it this way.  The only reason for 4 stars is because I did make a few of the suggestions made previously like garlic in the butter and oil, cornstarch and whipping cream because it should have more of a gravy to it and of coarse more liquers.  Definately on the to make again list.

Perfect. This recipe was really easy for someone with little cooking experience. The chicken was really tender and mushrooms were really tasty. There wasn't any sauce left to put on the chicken, but there was no need for it. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!!  my husband and my daughter loved it. I used more mushrooms and only marsala wine. Also use heavy cream and chicken stock for more sauce if you like. Great with spaghetti. :)

This dish is amazing.  I cooked this as the main dish for a dinner party I hosted a couple days ago and everybody loved it.  I did make slight adjustments, though: I used more oregano because 1/2 teaspoon was definitely not enough.  I also cooked the mushrooms and chicken separately so the mushrooms wouldn't absorb all the flavor of the wine, leaving the chicken bland.  Baby Bella mushrooms, in my opinion, work the best for this recipe.

absolutely fabulous!  i am not that creative in the kitchen, so followed the recipe exactly, except doubled the mushrooms and no sherry (since i don't have any).  my 9 year old said it was "the best meal mommy has ever cooked", and my hubby said no need to order chicken marsala at any restaurant anymore, since this one is the BEST one he has had!

this is by far, my favorite recipe on this site so far, and my favorite marsala recipe ever. i absolutely love the sherry/marsala combo and actually prefer the sauce less thick than the 'norm' i serve it over angelhair with garlic bread, its the perfect romantic meal. ive been using this recipe for a year and a half and its not going anywhere!

This recipe is excellent. I used some of the tips other reviewers had suggested, more mushrooms, 3/4 cups marsala instead of sherry, used cream but next time I will double the sauce. It just wasn't enough.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  Chicken Marsala is one of my favorite dishes when at an Italian restaurant and now with this recipe I can make it just as good.  My kids and boyfriend thought it was very good.  I will add this to my special dish nights.

I did not change anything, well maybe added more mushrooms.  It was a good Marsala recipe and my boyfriend said it is definitely "company material".  We made it with surprise mashed potatos - no potatoes use cauliflower.  It was a good match.

Yummy. I don't even like mushrooms and I loved this. And my husband who is extremely picky.. with one of his favorite dishes being chicken marsala, I was a little nervous because he's hard to impress.. he told me "The chicken is good!" So I know I did a good job.. lol. Definitely be making this again.

Excellent Dish!  I omitted the sherry (we do not like it) and added 3/4 cup marsala.  I would double the sauce recipe next time, it is so good.
Leftovers reheated very well.  Served with egg noodles.

Delicoous receipe, which is quick and easy to prepare, even for the occassional cook.  Salad and wild rice are great sides. Note, you will need a  tenderizing hammer, if you do not have one the bottom of a small pot works great.

Per the advice of other reviewers, I made a few minor changes and thought this dish was amazing!!  I LOVED it!  Before adding the chicken, I threw in a few pressed garlic cloves and half of a vidalia onion...then I doubled the mushrooms and the "sauce" - using 1 1/2 cups of marsala wine instead of the sherry - and at the end I added about a 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream to make a cream sauce....served over angel hair - YUM... healthy? NO...though I would say it's worth the splurge every now and then!!

I've been making this recipe for years. It's so easy are great every time.  But I do change it up. I put the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a resealable plastic bag, then added the pounded chicken and shook it up (one breast at a time) to coat. It's just easier and cleaner that way.  When browning the chicken breasts, I added a few sliced cloves of garlic.  I doubled the sauce and mushrooms. Then thickened it with a slurry (water-cornstarch mixture) at the end so we could enjoy it over the pasta i served it on.  This recipe rocks!

I omitted the cooking sherry and bumped up the Marsala wine to 3/4 cup and this was incredibly delicious!

Idk...I was so excited about this dish, followed it to a T, and was left disappointed. The flavor lacked for me, and I added quite a bit of extra seasoning!

This dish was outstanding!!!! I followed the suggestions from the previous reviewer and mixed the flour,salt,pepper and oregano in a zip bag. I also double the sauce recipe and added a splash of heavy cream and chicken broth. My husband is a chef and he LOVED IT!

This was good, but not WOW good. There was something that I couldn't quite point out that I didn't like. Maybe the sherry wine...not sure. I will make this again and tweak it around.

I agree with one of the comments to add 3/4 cup of marsala instead of cooking cherry. Prepaired this dish tonight and it was excellent. Be sure and cook mushrooms with wine and add heavy cream and then add browned chicken. Good stuff......

Really good - will definitely make again. Added garlic to butter and oil - will try adding onions as well next time. Also, I am going to triple the mushrooms as other reviewers did. Thank you for the recipe!

Did not use the right wine and the flaover was a little weak.  Make sure you have the correct wine and I think it will make a big difference.

My boyfriend raved about this recipe but I wasn't sold.. I'm giving it 5 stars in his honor. I added a small amount of cornstarch and water mixture to thicken it a little, which was a good choice. Next time I'll cut down on the sherry, add a little more marsala wine, and perhaps some onions, a little more garlic, some extra herbs, make the breading on the chicken a little thicker, and add a little cream for some richness

Simple and delicious! The flavors will please everyone and it's so easy to cook. I skipped the oregano because I'm not a fan, used Earth Balance instead of butter and cut the olive oil in half to trim off some fat. It came out very well and was a big hit.

I tried this exactly as was written but with a bit more sherry and marsala wine.  It was very good, but reading some of the other reviews make me want to change a few things.  Otherwise, a great starting recipe!

Tried this recipe for a dinner party I had and it was a hit. Everyone loved it. I tweeked it a little and added more butter then the recipe calls for. I also skipped the sherry and added more wine, and a little flour to make it thicker.

Added a little garlic to the saute and doubled up on the sauce fixin's so there would be plenty of leftover sauce for pasta. As suggested by other reviewers, I also added some cream. I don't know if it was my Marsala but it didn't taste as "wine-y" as I was hoping. Still, an excellent, relatively quick dinner that hubby truly appreciated.

Yumm, yumm, yumm!  I did it just slightly different:  I left out the Sherry and used only Marsala; I used 2 whole packages of mushrooms to cram extra veggies in there; I skipped dredging the chicken in flour and instead just sprinkled with salt, pepper and oregano on the chicken itself before adding to the pan; I also removed some of the wine sauce while it was cooking, mixed in a little bit of flour to thicken it and mixed it back in the rest...thickened up perfectly and was delish served over spaghetti.  I'll definitely make again!

This took a bit longer than stated but I was very pleased at how it came out!  My son didn't love it (but he is very fussy).  I even ate leftovers of this and I never warm up chicken because it comes out rubbery.  I will definately make this again for my boyfriend!

Not enough flavor and the chicken should really be cut up into small pieces to keep meat from becoming too dry. I will make this again but with a lot of tweaks.

This was fantastic.  Took the suggestions of others and cut back on the butter (2 TBS) and Olive Oil (3 TBS).  Also removed the chicken from the pan after cooking and deglazed the pan with liquids to make the sauce.  Added lost of extra mushrooms. Needed more sauce so added some chicken stock  and garlic and thickened with some of the leftover seasoned flour.  At the very end added a small amount of heavy cream.  Served over wheat linguine. My soon to be 3 year old kept saying "This is good, this is good!".  Very tasty.

Not the best marsala I've ever tasted, but the best I've ever made.  My 4 kids (ages 5-11) and husband all liked it very much.

This was UNBELIEVABLY good!  I used baby portobella mushrooms.  The whole family enjoyed it.  Like others, I used a ziploc bag to coat the chicken.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to T.  Definitely would make  again and perfect for company.

Very flavorful! I adjusted the amount of Marsala and Sherry to accomodate more chicken. I also added minced garlic ans onions as the chicken was simmering. After smmering on the stove I added a little cornstarch flurry (cornstarch and water) to thicken the sauce and let it simmer in the oven for 10 minutes. Served over red garlic mashed potatoes and the family loved it. Next time I will not dredge the chicken in flour, this made for soggy chicken.

I followed the recipe on my first try and it was terrific, thanks to Lisa.  The second time I was cooking for a group and modified the recipe by increasing the number of breasts, forgoing the pounding, and marinating in a mixture of olive oil, soy, garlic, and wine.  I then floured and baked the breasts in the oven, adding the mushrooms and wines as recommended, and serving with angel hair spaghetti.  It was slightly different from the original, but worked very well for a crowd.  Everyone wanted the recipe and I referred them to Allrecipes.

Excellent recipe.  Used Holland House sherry cooking wine and their Marsala cooking wine as well.  I also added some sour cream to the sauce which made it even more unbelievable!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  Deffinitely a keeper by my husbands review!

The chicken was delicious but the sauce was very bland - I would recommend using something like a mushroom risotto to serve it with.

This was amazing!! I was cooking for a group (of 15) so I did alter it. I browned the chicken with garlic and onion, and placed it in a baking dish with a splash of stock. Then poured the cooked mushroom/wine mixture over the chicken, and baked at 350 for 15 minutes. I also halved the sherry, doubled the marsala and mushrooms.  I will def. make this again. ;)

Outstanding....we all loved it....I added a tad more marsala, some garlic to the olive oil and butter and a splash or two of chicken stock.  Topped it off with some heavy cream and had some wonderful sauce to go along with the fresh fettichini.

AWESOME! I followed this recipe to the T, and it came out just like a Chicken Marsala that I order at a 5 star restaurant. Next time I'm going to double the recipe, so I can have some for the rest of the week!

Didn't have much flavor as it was cooking... Added italian dressing, a spoonful of yogurt/cornstarch slurry to thicken, and at the last minute a dash of Worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavor and it turned out great. I would definitely double the amount of sauce in order to serve with pasta.

This is the first recipe that came up on a Google search. Nearly 1900 reviews and almost all 5 stars - figured I couldn't go wrong. Coated the chicken in a Zip-Lok bag, used more oregano, some minced onion and garlic, doubled the mushrooms and more marsala and sherry. Removed the chicken to sautee the mushrooms in butter with the onion and garlic then braised the chicken with the sauce and mushrooms at the end. Delicious!

Served it to company and everyone enjoyed it. I did the first step of pan frying the chicken before everyone came over and kept it warm in the oven. That way all I had to do when my company was here was to throw the chicken, wine, and mushrooms in the pan and cook it for ten minutes and serve.  I used dry marsala and dry sherry. It was very tasty but I did season it once it was on my plate. I thought it needed a little salt. I may season the chicken with salt and pepper before flouring it next time. Definitely try this recipe.

Sauce was great, chicken ended up fantastic, but what's up with "1 cup sliced mushrooms"?  Chicken marsala demands lots of mushroom in my eyes and most the mushrooms were shrunken by the time the chicken was done so I added about 1 1/2 cups more and it ended up perfect!

This recipes is fantastic! I made it for our wedding anniversary dinner, and it made for such a special meal. I used Merlot in place of both the Marsala and sherry. The only thing I might do differently next time is to use less oil and butter and substitute some boxed stock instead to give it fewer calories without using the delicious flavor.

I couldn't believe that such a simple recipe could taste so good. I didn't change much...just used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, added some minced garlic,an entire can of sliced mushrooms and I eyeballed the Marsala. I didn't use the cooking sherry either. It smelled heavenly while cooking and was so moist and tender.The next day it was even more tasty!

I had a horrible experience at a new restaurant when I ordered this dish, so I decided to make it at home for the first time and it is now a favorite for me and my boyfriend!  It was so simple to make and I'm not a cook....he is!  I doubled pretty much everything and added fresh garlic and onions which are staples in a lot of what we eat and I also removed the chicken after browning in order to cook the onions and mushrooms a bit more before putting the chicken back in.  I popped a lid on everything and let it simmer for at least ten minutes if not more to blend all the flavor and to make sure the chicken absorbed some of the wonderful marsala sauce before serving over some angel hair pasta.  I forgot to thicken the sauce which I'll make sure to do next time in order to cover the pasta better, but all in all a wonderful and easy dish to make!!!

This was great!!! Too much butter though... Especially when advertised as a weeknight meal. We'd all have heart attacks! I used 1/3 cup olive oil and a tablespoon of butter.  Also, intead of beating the heck out of the chicken, I sliced each half breast so they were very thin.  I used WAY more oregano, most of which was fresh from my garden.  IMPORTANT: I used a 1/3rd cup more of each wine, and an onion that I added w the mushrooms to increase the sauce, to compensate for my lack of oil..    It was great!

I've tried other chicken marsala recipes but this one is my favorite.  The flavor is very good, and while I don't like mushrooms, I'll eat these!  I have a hard time flattening chicken, so instead I sliced the breasts in half while they were still slightly frozen. And as other reviewers suggested, I used a good marsala wine, which did make a big difference in flavor.

This was just OK for me.  I have been looking for the perfect chicken marsala recipe forever.  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated.  Next time I would only use Marsala, leaving out the sherry.  I would also double the sauce and use a little cream and possibly thicken it a little.  Thanks

Very good easy recipe.   I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and 1 chopped shallot with the mushrooms. You may also want to add a 1-2 teaspoon corn starch to thicken the sauce, especially if serving with pasta. Otherwise, the sauce, while mostly butter and oil, will sink to the bottom of the plate.

Thanks for this recipe. After reading several other reviewers, I made just a couple of adjustments. Added some additional "spice-age" to the flour mix (rosemary and garlic, primarily), browned the chicken breast, then removed it from the pan. I then sauted the mushrooms in the hot pan, (went easy on the mushrooms, though, as "The Hubbs" really doesn't care for them...) then deglazed with a full cup of the Marsala, reduced, then added a bit of heavy cream, then returned the chicken and simmered as directed. Flavors really married up nicely. Served with some garlic green beans and summer squash, plus a spinach salad.  Very nice.  Again, thanks for a good recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I did not use sherry, just increased the wine.  I had 2 breasts which I flattened then cut each one in half, if I was doing 4 breasts I would have doubled the sauce, it was all gone for just the 2!  I will be making this again, my husband loved it.

Fantastic!  I followed this recipe very closely, other than doubling the sauce because I wanted to serve it with mashed potatoes (will probably triple next time).  The only real change I made was that I got a little worried about the sauce being too thin so I decided to whisk in some heavy cream.  But the longer I let it simmer, the more I realized it would have thickened on its own anyway because of the wines reducing and the flour from the chicken pieces.  I used both the Marsala and Sherry and the flavor was amazing, just perfect.  Can't wait to make again, will make more next time so I can have leftovers.  Thanks so much for sharing this one, love it!!   [Update:  I made just the sauce tonight to try over steaks, I loved that too!  Yum!]

Everybody loved this!! I did make some changes. 1) I  put the flour and spices in a bag and shook the chicken, one piece at a time. 2) I added onion and garlic powders, Italian spices and used garlic salt instead of regular salt to the flour mix. 3) I put chopped onion and minced garlic in with the olive oil as I melted the butter. 4) I doubled the wine and sherry. 5) I added corn starch to thicken the sauce. Even those who didn't use extra sauce loved the flavor of the chicken.

I did as others suggested and added more Marsala Wine and Sherry. Also you cannot use too many mushrooms, my son grabbed most of them. It was a big hit and they can't wait to have it again.

This was alright. I thought that there was just too much Marsala and sherry. It made the sauce very runny. Maybe the next time I cook this for dinner I will cut the wine and sherry down to half what it calls for.

this recipe sounded and looked so good! i was disappointed. you should cut the chicken in strips or chunks as it would be easier to work with. we wanted to serve this over noodles like we've had in restaurants, but the sauce was so runny, it was impossible. i will make it again, as i do with every recipe just in case i screwed something up the first time. i think i'll add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. i may also add some garlic and some onion as well.

This is a great Chicken Marsala recipe. I had never made it before, but this recipe was simple and had a lot of good flavor. Of course, I think the quality of the wine makes a difference, but overall a great recipe.

Made this for my mom's birthday dinner.  Followed some other reviews and used all marsala, no sherry.  Added a little cream at the end to thicken up the sauce.  Needed extra seasonings, especially salt.

Great recipe.  Like other reviewers, I thought it needed some heavy cream to tame the wine taste as well as a little extra flour.

This is a tasty recipe!  The last time I made it I added shrimp (also lightly breaded) and it was D-Lish.  I also cook the mushrooms separately and use Holland House marsala cooking wine.  I saute the mushrooms then add the cooking wine, reduce, then pour over the chicken... cook another minute and ready to serve.

Very good recipe.  My oldest son loves chicken marsala, and now I make it at home for him.

THis recipe has a strong wine flavouring I do not like. I added 1 cup water and omitted the sherry. Also I skipped the flour coating and instead breaded the chicken with beaten egg and seasoned italian breadcrumbs. First partially frying the cutlets till browned. Adds anice flavour and helps to thicken the sauce a bit. Family loves it this way. Mild flavouring for picky eaters.

Excellent!!  This dish was a winner for my family.  Instead of pounding 4 chicken breast halves, I took 2 chicken breasts and slice them lengthwise through the center to make 4 pieces.  No pounding required and was enough for our family of 4.  I then mixed flour, salt, black pepper, & dried oregano in a ziplock  bag.  Shook each piece of chicken, next placing them in the buttered pan.  I didn't use oil and butter but rather substituted them with refrig. fat free/ calorie free Parkay spray.  Much healthier and tastes great!  After cooking each side of chicken, I placed them in a 250 degree oven to keep warm.  Using the same pan I cooked the chicken in, I added 1, 8 oz. package of mushrooms (I had to slice), some minced garlic, and dried onion.  After cooking this for a couple of minutes, I added a dry marsala wine (Colombo) but didn't used the cooking sherry and doubled it.  This measured out to be 1 1/2 cups of marsala wine, then I added 3/4 cup of Swanson's chicken broth.  Covered and let boil for about 15 min. then I added in a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken the sauce.  Lastly removed the chicken from the oven and into the pan to coat with sauce.  I made mashed potatoes and broccoli and there was plenty of sauce to add atop.  Definitely recommend to all, and again thank you Lisa!

Good recipe with good flavor.  Next time I too will add some cream to the sauce to thicken it.  I will also add more mushrooms, probably double.  With those changes, I will make this again.

Chicken Marsala is ALWAYS good!  There's something about cooking the chicken in the Marsala that makes it so tender!  I always add cream to cut the bitterness (or sharpness) of the Marsala and or wine.  It comes out GREAT.  Oh, and I love mushrooms so I usually add a LOT!

I love this recipe!  Quick and easy!  I have made it 3 times, each time I cut olive oil and butter in half, replaced the sherry with more marsala and added a full 8 oz container of mushrooms.  Delicious!  I'd like to make it with the sherry, just haven't had it on hand.  Served with pasta and both the kids and hubby loved it!

This recipe was so delicious! My family raved about it. I only used marsala and wine and omited the sherry as I didn't have any on hand. I used 3/4 c. of marsala wine and next time will add more. I will also try a splash of heavy cram next time and more mushrooms.

I was desperate for a simple tasty meal to tempt the appetite of my ailing hubby, and found this almost by accident. I don't use cooking wine but had both Marsala and sherry on hand. I was out of oregano, but used a bit of marjoram in its place.  I used a mix of white and baby Bella mushrooms, and served it with lightly buttered and parsleyed noodles. Lovely! He ate significantly more than usual, thoroughly enjoyed it and so did I! this is now on my Wall of Fame with other favorite recipes ;-)

My daughter made this recipe for me and her father over the Christmas holiday.  I was delicious !  I was so taken by the taste and tenderness of the chicken that I made it for our New Year's Day guests.  They raved about it.  A great recipe.  Try it, you'll love it.

I am always looking for a new and great chicken recipe. I have a stomache condition and chicken and pork are about the only meat that I am able to handle without the infamous acid reflux. I have tried several versions of this recipe and this is the one that looks exactly like it tastes. TRY IT! Its scrumdidilyumptious!

Excellent, with a few modifications as mentioned by other reviewers (since they spoke to my personal taste buds). I used heavy cream mixed with flour and chicken broth to both thicken the sauce and increase the volume of sauce. Double the quantity of mushrooms, as well. Definitely use BOTH the marsala and sherry -- this is what gives it the gourmet edge that your guests will rave about and wonder how you did it. I served with wide noodles and broccoli. Boyfriend wondered how I hadn't been "snatched up yet" with my cooking skills  (little does he know how easy some recipes can be ).

Excellent...with some changes.  Agree with many of the other reviewers that you need to double sauce and mushrooms!  Also, sauted mushrooms and about 4 cloves of garlic in butter with some garlic salt before adding it to chicken/wine mixture. Delicious, this recipe is a keeper.

Great dish that's relatively quick, especially if you pre-pound the chicken. Put on the rice, I also over tripled the sauce, (took the ckicken out on  a platter to keep warm i the oven, & added diced roasted jarred garlic) adding 1 1/2C Marsal, 1/4C Good sherry, 3/4 mushroom broth, 1 C chicken broth & the corn startch slurry was made with the water from jarred mushrooms I used (no fresh on hand that day. I added the extra liquids as I thought the sauce as is was too WINE/ALCHOHOL tasting for my girls to go for it. It made a great dish

This was a great recipe.  I did take some advice from others and used only Marsala cooking wine and also added some whipping cream to the sauce.  I made double the sauce as well so that I could cover the pasta with the sauce also.  This is a keeper.

I served this dish to company last night.  Got rave reviews.  I did make some changes:  I added garlic to the mushrooms and added cream at the very end of cooking which helped it to thicken.

Delicious, quick and easy.  We used 3 chicken breasts.  Doubled the sauce without doubling the oil.  Added a splash of heavy cream to the sauce.  After the chicken was cooked, we removed it from the sauce and thickened the sauce with a few TB of cornstarch slurry.  Served with pasta and green beans.  Yum.

This is such a great recipe.. I added a whole container (probably 2 cups) of sliced baby bella mushrooms.  It soaked up all the sauce, and still tasted great.  I put the chicken & mushrooms on top of pasta with alfredo sauce..  Added a side of roasted asparagus.. What a great quick & easy meal!

I have not had Marsala in a while and forgot how good it is.  This sauce is so good that it would be a shame not to make double.  I beleive that it is important to use a good sweet Marsala since it is the main ingredient!  I also like my sauce thick and creamy so I added both a corn starch and water slurry to thicken plus some half and half for creamy decadence.  I sauteed portabellas with minced garlic and served it all over angel hair pasta.  Deelish!

Sooooo easy and soooo delicious.  I agree with doubling the sauce, adding a couple garlic cloves and replacing the sherry with extra marsala (Sheffield, $8/bottle).  No need for Macaroni Grill now!  Thanks for sharing!

I really try to follow the recipe the first time I try something so I can give an accurate rating. this was pretty good, but not the best. first thing I would change is half the oil and butter, so it doesn't "deep Fry" the chicken. just enough to seer the outside. then I would tripple the mushrooms and double the sauce and only use good wine.

This turned out very good! A few changes- I used half as much butter and olive oil (2 Tbsp each)-we really didn't miss it. Browned 2 cloves of pressed garlic before adding the chicken, halved the oregano and added a shake of basil instead, ended up cooking the chicken in 2 batches, put first batch in the oven on warm then when the second batch was ready added it back to the pan and added the wines, plus about half cup of chicken broth, simmered 10 mins flipping chicken half way through, removed chicken from sauce, turned up the heat to high for about 4 mins to reduce the sauce until slightly thickened (no cornstrach needed, add chicken back to pan for a min. Served over angel hair pasta, yum!

This is great, but as with most, I made a few changes: I added about a half teaspoon of garlic powder (I had no 'real' garlic), I use cut-up chicken rather than individual breasts.  Also, it's pretty easy to cut down on the fat in this recipe (4T oil and 4T butter is a little excessive for four servings) by using a bit more Marsala (and I've never used the cooking sherry).  Also, last time I added a half diced red onion (I know this heresy, but it needed 'something') and it was delish.  A little worsteshire and/or a squeeze of lemon are both good, too.

SO good and SO easy.  Stick with the butter and the oil -- it makes such a difference.  I added 1/4 fresh lemon (squeezed & tossed in) and 1 tbls capers to mix.  Gives a bit of a tart/zing that we like.

This is one of my husband's favorite meals! It's so easy and for the most part, I always have the ingredients on hand. I never add the sherry - just use a bit more marsala and it turns out perfect!

This dish was fantastic!  I honestly think it is my new favorite dish to make.  I am a big fan of chicken marsala in restaurants, so I was a bit hesitant to try it at home.  I did not add the sherry (only because I forgot to buy it) and took the advice to add cream to the broth at the end to make a "gravy".  I made roasted red potatoes on the side, put the gravy over them.....YUM!  My husband says he wouldn't change a thing!

This was soooo good and easy too. I bought the pre-cut and washed criminis and used chicken tenders (no pounding). I also took the advice of a few others and sauteed thinly sliced onion and garlic before adding the chicken to cook. Once the chicken was browned on both sides, I added additional butter and oil to double the sauce (What the heck. We don't eat like this very often.)After simmering for 10 min, I added a little FF half and half to finish the sauce. Served over linguini - YUM!

This was very tasty, I only had Melot on hand, this could have used more mushrooms and some more seasoning.  I added some season salt and more pepper.  The chicken was very moist and full of flavor.

Excellent dish!  I followed the recipe, but I did add minced garlic and 1 chopped onion.  I also thickened sauce to gravy at the end with a bit of cornstarch/water mixture.  Served this dish over angel hair pasta.  Yummy!!  May try to make this in the crock pot next time.  enjoy.

This was a really good recipe - I put in double the wine by mistake - but that worked out okay. I also took other reviewers suggestion and added garlic in the butter and oil, that made a difference for me.  Thanks

I just read a 2 star rating of this recipe and I simply don't understand. It excelled in the two most important catagories. Simplicity and taste. Didn't need to change the recipe in any way. I'm not a big fan of mushrooms( I like the flavor just not the texture) but my wife is so I put them in. They were simple to pull to the side so everyone was happy. Will make this again often. Two thumbs up !!!!

I'm a total cooking novice, and this was incredibly easy to make.  This dish has a light flavor.  It is delicious, but quite different than the standard restaurant version.  Next time, I will double the mushrooms.

This was a great chicken Marsala recipe! Thanks for sharing. It was very simple and quick to put together. I didn't use sherry wine, just replaced that with extra Marsala. I also added a bit of cream to the sauce, then thickened it with about a tablespoon or two of cornstarch.

Wonderful flavor! One of the best chicken dinners I've ever made and I've made many through the years. My husband asks for this almost every week. He says this tops the best Chicken Marsala he's ever had in any 5 star restaurant. I did add much more Marsala wine then called for since I didn't have cooking sherry but it still came out great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Lisa!

What a great and super easy recipe! I omitted mushrooms due to family needs, doubled the marsala and sherry becuase we like "sauce" and the taste was amazing.  My husband said it was the best chicken dish I have ever made, replacing his favorite of 6 years.  He also said it's the best Marsala he's ever had - and he's an Italian who grew up looking at the Manhattan skyline!

This is my "go to" recipe for making chicken marsala. My whole family loves it. The only changes I made was adding flour to my mushrooms while sauteing them to thicken the sauce as well as adding a bulb of garlic roasted in olive oil.   I use the infused oil for browning the chicken. I do not use cooking sherry, only stock and marsala wine. Those added with the roasted garlic and fresh oregano make a really big difference.

Simply amazing!! Definitely double or triple the sauce and mushrooms to put over angel hair pasta. If using cooking wines cut the salt in half as the cooking wines have more salt than standard wines.

I have tried to make a recipe different than this before which turned out worse, this was much better. The outside of the chicken was a bit slimy so I asked my friend who cooks at an Italian restaurant for tips. The way she made it was pretty similar to this recipe and she thought my problem was needing to brown the chicken a bit longer. She also said to cook it at a very high temp after adding the wine to burn the alcohol off. I will try it again and see what happens at a high temp, uncovered.

Tastewise there is no need to change anything. I use less oil and butter for health reasons (we have copper-bottom pans that can cook efficiently without the extra fat). Don't skip pounding out the chicken. It makes such a difference, not to mention the chicken cooks faster. My son actually doesn't like this--he says it smells like beer. :) But he loves when I make it because it means he gets to hit raw chicken with a mallet and shout all the dead-chicken insults his 11-year-old mind can muster.

This recipe is so easy. I was always intimidated to make a Marsala dish, but thanks to this posting, I tried it and it was a big success. This will be my next dish I make when we have a dinner party.

I made this last weekend for a crowd of about 25.  I prepared it all on Saturday and then baked it in the oven on Sunday.  I was a bit nervous about preparing it inadvanced but it turned out fabulous!  I made a few changes.  I did not use sherry instead I used chicken broth.  I also added a packet of beef boullion to enhance the flavor and also some pressed garlic and parsley.  It actually tasted even better the next day.  The chicken was so tender it melted in your mouth.  This is a definite make a head receipe for a crowd.

It was very good and believe it or not I didn't have any Marsala so I used Port instead.  It was much better than the chicken Marsala I had the other night at an expensive restaurant.  If you don't have Marsala try it with Port.  I think it is just as good but different.  I plan to get some Marsala and try it again to see which one I like better.  Other than using Port I followed the recipe.  The sauce in a true Chicken Marsala isn't thick and absorbs into the noodles.  I used good whole wheat noodles.  I like whole wheat pasta.

This was good and will make again. The sauce was a little sweet for me, so I think a pinch of cayenne may be good to balance it out. I browned the chicken well, then set it aside and started the sauce. I let the mushrooms cook in just a splash of chicken broth and the fond from the chicken. After about 8 min, I added the wine/sherry and let that cook for a few more min. Then I added about a half cup of chicken stock with a few tablespoons of non-dairy sourcream (toffuti is the best brand on earth, my husband can not have regular). When the sauce was nearly reduced to the preferred consistency, I added the chicken for a few more min to warm up. I served with fettucine tossed with a butter/lemon/garlic/sherry sauce (basically what you would use for shrimp scampi).

I added heavy cream and it turned out great. I like the coating for the chicken but i think next time i will use less oil and butter. Half would have been enough.

My husband made this recipe tonight and it was good.  We would have left out the Sherry all together and replaced it with more Marsala.  Also the sauce was a bit thin, so we added some corn starch to thicken it up.

This is so tasty!  I have made this for several dinner parties and everyone raved about how moist and wonderful it was.  Make sure to pound the chicken out evenly and to at least 1/2 inch so it cooks quickly and doesn't burn on the outside.  I would recommend doubling the sauce so you have a little extra to serve over garlic mashed potatoes.  I used a thermometer to cook the chicken to keep it from being over done and dry and then transferred it to a big electric roaster while I finished preparing the rest of the chicken (I did a party for 24).  Every single piece was eaten and people were asking for more.  Thanks to whoever submitted this recipe!  It has become a favorite of mine.

Fantastic recipe- definately a keeper! I read some of the other suggestions and kind of put my own spin on the recipe. Heres what I did. Followed a previous posters idea to "shake" the chicken in a ziplock with the flour mixture. I used the very thinly sliced chicken breasts so I would not have to pound them out.  Then I followed the directions and added (when I added the mushrooms and liquids) a clove of freshly grated garlic, (no sherry- I just added some of my resiling wine in the fridge instead). I also added freshly chopped parsley and a few squeezes of lemon to the sauce, oh and about 1/8 cup of fat free half and half to thicken it some. I served it over whole wheat pasta, with risotto and grean beans. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great recipe & really easy and fast to make. I followed the suggestions...such as..used a ziploc bag to coat chicken, tripled mushrooms, double sauce, added chicken broth and garlic. I served this over long grain rice. Big hit with the boyfriend!

I have made other variations of this recipe. This one made it easy and tasty, however,  thickening the sauce, with heavy whipping cream really adds to the richness and using lots of mushrooms.  Better Marsala wine makes the taste.  This is my favorite recipe and serve it for guest often!

Thought this was pretty good though not "great."  (Hence 4 instead of 5.)  I did use marsala since I have it.  I've made it twice and don't recall, but I likely either only used the butter or maybe cut both butter and oil in half, as I would not want that much fat.  The only thing I dislike is pounding out chicken...

I stuck to the exact recipe. It was good - but if I were to make Chicken Marsala again, I would prefer a richer recipe with onions, chicken stock, etc. This was a simple recipe and therefore a little lacking.

Truth be told, I don't usually enjoy chicken marsala, but I thought I'd endure it b/c my hubby LOVES it. The flavors have always been a bit too subtle for me, but this dish is the exception. I really liked this dish. It was rich and flavorful; however if you are the type to enjoy a subtle dish of marsala this recipe may not be for you.

Lovely recipe.  I gave this a 5, because I am sure the recipe would be good on it's own - I made the changes to suit our taste/lifestyle.  I made it exactly as written, except only used the olive oil, added a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce,(the heavy cream that others suggested looked wonderful, but oh the cholesterol, and hubby had a heart attack last summer!), and made double the sauce to serve over pasta (linguine tonight, who knows next time?).  I also eliminated the salt, per my usual the first time I make a recipe, but will add it to the flour mixture next time, since there isn't the salt from the butter.  Served with steamed sugar snap peas and a simple spinach salad.  Thanks for such a tasty , quick and easy recipe!

I was looking for an easy quick recipe, so I decided to try this.  We really enjoyed our dinner.  The next time, I would definately add more marsala and mushrooms.  I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

I would definitely reccomend trying this dish if you are a fan of sweet chicken marsala. My husband made this recipe for me for a date night he planned. I picked it off the website, he made it. He is a good cook and has the mind of an engineer-so I trust he followed EXACTLY what the recipe says.  We both enjoyed the meal but our expectations were very high after reading the reviews and we felt slightly let down. Both of us ended up adding a bit of salt, and both agreed it tasted like SOMETHING was missing but couldn't figure out what. I also found myself longing for more mushrooms. That is why I gave this dish 4 instead of 5. I would reccomend any marsala fan give it a try though.

So good just like one of my favorite restaurants! Followed recipe as is w/ some additions. Boiled pasta while cooking chicken. Grilled chicken with addition of 1 tbspn of minced garlic. Once cooked through, removed chicken and     mushrooms (1 pack of sliced Portabella). Mixed 1 tspn of corn starch in water and slowly added to sauce to thicken. Tossed in whole wheat pasta and 1/2 cup of chopped parsley (or to your liking). Wow! Highly recommended!

My family & I thought this was wonderful.  I didn't follow the recipe measurements exactly and it still came out fantastic.  I think that's what I really like about it - You can look at it once, get the idea, and make it your own.  5 Stars because it made me feel like a great cook.

awesome and easy!  few changes...1) sliced up garlic and added to the sauce.  2) doubled the marsala and wine sauce and thickened with flour to have extra sauce for the angel hair pasta I served the chicken on!

This recipe was fantastic! The only changes I made were I used dried parsley instead of oregano, 3 lbs. of chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts, 1 stick of butter and 2 tab. of olive oil, and baby portebella mushrooms. I also coated the chicken pieces using a plastic bag instead of a shallow dish. Everyone raved and it was so easy to make. Definitely a keeper.

Pretty good!  My only criticism is that I got to the simmer part of the recipe and wondered where the EVOO came in.  I missed the part about melting the butter IN the oil.  Still turned out OK.

Wonderful meal. I have a two picky eaters in my home, hubby and a 4(soon to be 5) year old.  She loves this dish, and so does my honey. The only thing I have to do is not make it as often, so they won't grow tired of it.  I added heavy cream, garlic (I'm a garlic lover) and a little more butter along with the mushrooms. after I removed the chicken after it browned.  I thickend the sauce with cornstarch.  I also served this with squash and sugar peas as sides, mmm,mmm,mmm, DELISH! This one's a keeper!

Delicious and so quick and easy to make!  I haven't had sherry on hand, so instead use 3/4 cup Marsala.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious.  I also add sliced onions and garlic with the mushrooms.  I've made this several times and didn't always have sherry and marsala wine so I've gotten creative with my substitutions.  I've used double the wine instead of sherry/wine.  Some times I didn't have sherry or marsala so I used chardonnay and even white zinfandel in a pinch.  Each time it comes out very flavorful.  I highly recommend serving with mashed potatoes.

Wow, this has like nine million ratings and I can see why.  It is *SO GOOD*.  Tastes just like the chicken marsala I had in a little Italian restaurant a few years back.  I made it just as is, only subbed pinot grigio for marsala wine (since it's what I had) and chicken broth for the sherry (since I hate sherry).  It was DELISH, as I'm sure the original recipe is as well.  Squeezed a wedge of lemon over the finished plate and it was HEAVEN ON EARTH.  Loved it, make it TONIGHT!!!!

I made this last night for dinner and I really felt like something special! This was my first time making Chicken marsala and in my opinion it came out better than what I get at the restaurant.

I made this yesterday for Christmas.  I had a group of people over - one didn't like turkey, one didn't eat ham, another didn't eat beef etc.  This made a good Christmas dinner - elegant, easy and everyone liked it.  I breaded and cooked the chicken (8 servings) the night before.  Christmas day, I made the sauce and then put the chicken back in to simmer in the sauce.  It was ready sooner than I expected, so I put the whole thing in the oven to keep warm. I also made several changes to the sauce. I cooked four green onions and a half teaspoon of minced garlic with the the mushrooms (more garlic would be good but I wasn't sure my guests liked garlic).  Like others here, I substituted Marsala wine for the sherry.  Because I didn't make the sauce in the same pan I'd cooked the chicken in, I boiled a bullion cube in a half cup of water and added that too. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a little cornstarch and a few tablespoons of cream at the end.  Great!! Everyone loved it. I will make this again!!

I followed the suggestions made by other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  I also added some garlic/onion powder to the flour.  This turned out great.  I added cornstartch and cream to the sauce afterwards to thicken up the sauce -- but I added too much.  Still tasted good! Served it to family that was in town with angel hair pasta.  It was a huge hit!

I made this for my then-boyfriend-now-husband about 3 years ago for our first date and he said it was the best he'd ever had, including from a restaurant. I tweak it slightly: once the chicken is browned and the mushrooms added, I take the chicken out, add about 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of chicken broth. Let it reduce for a creamy sauce. I serve it over angel hair with Classico Traditional Basil Pesto (in the pasta sauce aisle, very small jar, top shelf of Food Lion if you shop there!). Great recipe!
***EDIT: I forgot to mention that I cut the chicken into thick pieces/slices and coat them individually - it makes this dish much more "user friendly" and also adds flavor as each piece is seasoned. Enjoy!

Great recipe. I've made it at least a dozen times, and it always turns out wonderfully and is a great company pleaser. I find it tastier with a little white-wine Worcestershire sauce.

As the other reviewers have noted, this is an awesome dish loved by all, and a real standby for company. I think it is the best with the suggestions recommended by reviewers, like skip the sherry, use all Marsala, remove the chicken after browning and return the chicken after cooking the mushrooms( add lots more than suggested).  I improvised and made this recipe with cheap cubed pork steaks- tastes like veal!!!

Wonderful! use veal! I have tried it with veal and chicken. The veal is simply perfect. I put it in at the same time it says to put in the chicken, but i only cooked it for a minute or so and then removed it until the end just to re heat it. I also used angel hair noodles with the remaining sauce after it was done cooking.

Huh...absolutely perfect.  Only change was to take the chicken out after browning it and then putting it back in after the sauce was made.  First time making this and it was awesome.  The family LOVED it.  This one is going in my book.  BTW:  For those of you who had trouble finding Marsala wine like I did (went to 3 different places that didn't carry it) Trader Joe's had it.  If you have one in your area, give them a call first.

My husband loves this and says it should be our "company" dinner for when we have friends over. I often slice the chicken breasts into tenders so the chicken cooks more evenly. Delicious!

Awsome recipe.  I always make extra sauce and I add heavy cream at the end, let it thicken a bit and it turns into a creamy marsala sauce.  Serve with angel hair pasta and you'll never eat chicken marsala out at a restaurant again.

Looked just like the pic, the breading stayed on perfectly.  I like that you can work on your side while the chicken is simmering stovetop.  Above-average weeknight meal.  Thanks for recipe!

Very good, but I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit "greasy".  I'll cut the butter and oil in 1/2 next time.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.

This is one of my favorite dishes to make for company. It tastes like something you'd get in a restaurant. I serve it with mashed garlic red potatoes. Yum!

This is a very tasty recipe. I made it for my mom's birthday. Everyone who ate it, liked it. I don't like mushrooms, so I picked them out, but the sauce was yummy (I don't care for wine either, so that says a lot!). The breading definitely adds flavor. I served the chicken with mostaccioli (noodles and sauce, no cheese or meat), a tossed salad and garlic bread. Overall, a good and very easy dish to prepare. Thanks for sharing!

I AM A CHICKEN MARSALA FAN, AND HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE THREE TIMES. THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE TONIGHT WAS TO FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY AND ADD THE SHERRY(I NEVER HAD ANY ON HAND BEFORE)AND BOY DOES IT EVER MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CHICKEN MARSALA I HAVE EVER HAD. I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS IF I COULD. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

Wonderful!  I added onion, garlic and extra mushrooms as others suggested.  It smelled so good, I could hardly keep my hubby out of the kitchen while it simmered.

This was simple to make. I doubled the sauce to serve over pasta. I also doubled the mushrooms. I took the advice of others and added chicken broth, heavy cream, and a  little corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also marinated the thin slice chicken breast with worchester sauce, garlic, and onion for 10 minutes before dipping into the flour batter. If you leave the floured chicken in the fridge for a few minutes it will help the flour stick better when frying. The dish came out wonderful.

I was suprised how easy this was to make, even on a weeknight. Very nice flavor, I use a no trans fat margarine because we are on a low fat diet, and you would never know.

This recipe is very tasty.  I doubled the mushrooms (which I think I may triple the next time - I love mushrooms!) and I used 1 cup of marsala wine sauce instead.  Other than that, I used the recipe as is, and it was delicious.  I will definitely be making again.

This was delicious. I didn't change anything besides adding 1/4-1/2 c chicken stock just to stretch the sauce to serve over pasta. I used crimini mushrooms. SOOOOO simple and good.. just the kind of food I like! I'll be making this a lot! Thanks :)

This was great, but of course I tweaked to my version as a lot of people do. I added onion powder to the flour mixture.  I used a touch of garlic oil with the olive oil and butter in the pan. Used half the butter as well. After browning chicken, I took them out and threw in a shallot and some garlic..Sauted quickly and then added mushrooms. You may need a little more olive oil..I season with the spices at each step. I used baby bellas and a variety package..Different types of shrooms will change the dish.  I then threw in the Marsala and Sherry which I tripled..Let this cook off for a few minutes, add the chicken and simmer until chicken is cooked.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes..Drizzling the sauce over them was heaven!!

Yummy.  I used a little over 1/3 cup of flour to bread the chicken, and what I did was I placed the 4 chicken breasts in the flour/seasoning mixture, saw that I had a lot left over to use, and I sprayed the coated breasts with Parkay spray butter, then recoated them to use up any excess flour.  I used garlic pepper instead of regular, and I used about 1/4 tsp. of Nature's Seasonings.  Also, I added about 3tbsp. of half-n-half to wine sauce, and about 2 tbsp. of flour to thicken the sauce up.  I added the flour before the mixture became to hot, as the flour will clump up if you stir it in while the sauce is boiling.  Based on these modifications, the entree was delicious.

Simple, quick and delicious.  I use this recipe a lot.  One thing to note is that the recipe does vary due to what kind of marsala and sherry you use.  The first time I made it I used cooking sherry.  Strangely enough, I think that was the best and produced the most flavorful meal.  But for the most part, I use what I have on hand and it really does make a difference.  I've used both dry and sweet marsala.  Amontillado, cream sherry, etc.  Adjust to your liking..

This was great!! My fiance and I loved it. Per recommendations, I added a little heavy cream and cornstarch. Next time I will double the sauce, because it didn't seem to be enough. I served it over spaghetti, no angel hair, but it was still great.

This recipe is so exceptional!! 

I made it for four people and the only part I modified was adding 1 cup of chicken stock. 

I definitely recommend this recipe, it takes like it came from a 3 star restaurant!!

Tried this last night on pork and it turned out great! I doubled the sauce and added tons more mushrooms. I thickened the sauce after it was cooked. It seems to have WAY more butter/oil than it needed so I will reduce that by at least 1/2 next time to reduce the fat and calorie load. Other than that, it was really tasty.

I modified this recipe by adding more mushrooms,sweet onions, marjoram and heavy whipping cream,and chicken stock also I used the seasoned flour(with marjoram added) with melted butter to make a rue to thicken the sauce. It was awesome over angel hair pasta. We loved it!

Very good!  I eliminated the butter and the olive oil and used Pam spray for less fat (worked really well :)). I didn't use the sherry, either, though and I cut my chicken up into bite sized bits AFTER it had cooked in the mix so that it would be more tender and easier for my kids.  Wonderful!  Will make again!  Thanks!

I made this for my family of 5 and everyone, even the baby, loved it. It reminded me of a dish from the Cheesecake Factory that I loved so I will definitely make this again. I followed the suggestions from other users and doubled the sauce and mushrooms and didn't use the cooking sherry. I also added a little Parmesan cheese to the flour mixture and ended up melting mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken. It was yummy!

Very good! Not resturant quality but had great flavor. I added garlic powder to the flour mixture and also a little garlic to the pan while browning the chicken.

Everyone loved it. Didn't really change anything. I had to cook the chicken in batches and keep warm in the oven due to our large family. Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Excellent recipe

One of our all time favorites. I serve this with Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I add more wine than the recipe calls for to create a sauce for the potatoes.  Simply Wonderful!

Recipe was very good, but was missing something...but I'm not sure what. It could possibly have had too much sherry. I'd definitely make again.

This was a great recipe, the only change I made was to double the breading mix & doubled the Sherry & Marsala and added 1/2 cup of yellow onion. The sauce turned out to be just the right amount for 4 large breasts.

Excellent.  I ended up using 3 T of butter, a 12 oz. package of sliced mushrooms and 1 cup Marsala (no Sherry).  I only used 2 chicken breasts for a total of 2 servings, but we like a good portion of sauce.   Will definitely make again.

Very good and easy to make. I didn't have sherry so I used water instead. I doubled the sauce but next time will make even more so I have enough of a gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  When making this meal, I did make some modifications. I added more spices to the flour mixture to give the chicken more flavor.  I increased the amount of seasoning that the recipe called for and added some garlic powder and basil.  I also browned some garlic in the oil and butter before adding the chicken.  I added some fat free half and half and chicken broth to the sauce to make it creamier and richer, and I also thickened up the sauce with a slurry (cornstarch and water mixture) so that it could be served over low carb linguine.

followed the recipe to the tee and found it a little bland.  I guess using real marsala wine may have made a difference.

Served this at a family dinner for 10 last night. = It was surprisingly simple to make and did not require a huge amount of ingredients (most of it I already had on hand). It got rave reviews from everyone - even my 7 year old nephew and my 2 1/2 year old son. I didn't have a chance to test it out before serving it to family (which I normally try to do) so was delighted that everyone loved it. I give it only 4 stars though because although a wonderful dish, I've had better Chicken Marsala (at a fine Italian restaurant of course).

Not that this recipe needs any more reviews...it's more for my recipe box than anything. We thought that it was good. I like that it was easy to prepare and the chicken was tender and moist. But my husband and I thought that it was missing something. Next time I will follow others' advice and use fresh garlic and extra spices. I did use a couple tbls. of cream and cornstarch to thicken the sauce so we could serve it over linguine.

Very easy recipe and really good! Definitely use "real" sherry and not cooking sherry. I added crushed red pepper flakes as recommended by another viewer but we felt like it would be equally wonderful without that addition. Did add a splash of cream at the end and it really melded the flavors of the sauce.

Pretty good. I made double the sauce, added 1/2n1/2, & mixed in rice. Will make again, but will serve chicken & mushrooms as is, & have rice on the side or will serve over noodles as others have recommended. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight for dinner with steamed zuchini, yellow squash and red bell pepper. The veggies got the most compliments along with the mushrooms and sauce. However the universal vote on the chicken was that it needs something more. Perhaps some more oregeno or garlic maybe it could be a hint of hot pepper? I don't know yet but next time I make this I will be experimenting. Otherwise it was great.

I thought this recipe was awesome. I haven't had Marsala in a restaurant so I had nothing to compare it to. I made a few changes, I didn't have any sherry, so I used 3/4 cup of marsala wine. I also added a flour/water mixture to thicken the sauce. Next time, I'll try whipping cream as others have suggested. Next time, I will add many more mushrooms, a hint of garlic and more sauce. Overall, I found the dish very flavorful and easy! I will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and it comes out great every time!  I used two cups of mushrooms (personal preference) and even though the sauce is very thin I doubled the wines and let the excess mix in with some pasta and green beans. Very good!

Excellent dish, my chicken breast fillets were a little large so I cooked an additional 10 minutes. Tranfered chicken to plate and covered while I reduced the sauce and thickened slightly. Added pinch of Black Truffle salt to sauce for that speacial flavour.

I made this tonight, and it was quite good. I will make it again, but will definitely use less butter & oil. I bought Tyson thin cut chicken breasts so I did not have to pound them. The chicken was very tender. I served this with noodles and steamed cauliflower.

I followed the recipe with the following exception:  I added 1/4 tea. celery salt to the flour mixture.  This seemed to add the needed "umph" to the flavor.  Otherwise, a great dish!

Update: I tried this dish again. With more olive oil and no starch or broth, the sauce came out perfect. The only negative now is that it needs much more sauce than the recipe calls for. Pretty good... I upped the spices, used a lot more portabello mushrooms, and added a little corn starch and chicken broth. Subtracted the sherry and added a little more marsala. Tasty... not perfect, but that's probably more because of my lack of skill. Relatively bachelor-friendly meal.

This was suprisingly fast to make, and so delicious! This is a favorite restaurant choice and this recipe tastes just as good if not better then any restaurant. I took some tips from other reviews and whisked in a tbs of flour to the sauce to thicken.

This is a great, simple recipe for chicken marsala.  I doubled the amount of mushrooms & next time I may even triple it.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It is so easy and I think I will take some of the suggestions and add heavy cream to make it creamier for pasta. I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and either green beans or peas.

I did my own thing with this recipe and made it so easy. I slice my chicken breast and seasoned flour it then combined butter and olive oil to cook up the chicken. Once it all is browned nicely, I add the marsala (lots more than called for) and baby bella and white mushrooms sliced really thin. The flour on the chicken thickens the sauce nicely. I then serve it over rice.

This recipe is delicious!  I did it just as the recipe read and it came out perfect.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was supeer flavorful with the perfect consistency.  As my 18 year old son came down stairs for dinner he mentioned how awesome the whole house smelled and his friend, who doesn't like mushrooms, ate every last one!  Needless to say, my husband and I cleaned our plates!!

This recipe is fantastic!  My husband and I altered it a bit here and there:
*3/4 cup of Marsala wine
*~1/2 cup (or more) Sherry
*I added Cardamom to the flour mixture
We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and glazed carrots.
**Dinner was magnificent!  =)

This was excellent!  I followed other reviewer's advice, doubled the sauce and added some half and half and a bit of cornstarch at the end.  It only gets a 4 because I think you really need to double the sauce to have enough and the cream in the sauce really makes it.

Good recipe-- and easy.  I tried a variation with pork instead of chicken; it turned out great.  The key is using a high quality Marsala-- when I used the cheap stuff it was not memorable.

alright the recipe as stated is very good. I have made this many times and think it is best with more mushrooms and a little thickening to the sauce with either cornstarch or flour. I always cook chicken before preparing the sauce. If making on the fly you can try using some chicken broth and beer to substitute the wine and sherry.

This was the tenderest Marsala I've ever eaten. I used portabella mushrooms to add a nutty flavor to the Marsala sauce, and reduced the butter used by half. I recommend mashed yukon gold potatos as these allow you to savor the sauce.Every one that has had this gives me excellent marks.

Wonderful taste and easy to fix.  I followed another rater's suggestion and went with 3/4 cup of Marsala wine and added another 1/4 cup after I added the mushrooms.  That one cup didn't make enough sauce, so I will use two cups next time.  And yes, you do need corn starch to thicken.  I also added 5 cloves of garlic, crushed, to the oil before adding the chicken.  But then my theory on garlic is too much is just about right.

This is a wonderful recipe, although the sauce was a little to runny.  I will definately prepare this one again, maybe adding a small amount of flour or cornstarch to thicken it up.

I used to order chicken marsala out all the time.  Now that I know it's so easy to make at home I just don't think I can anymore!  This was wonderful and simple.  As others suggested I added more mushrooms and some heavy whipping cream to the sauce.    Thanks for your recipe, Lisa!

I left this on the stove after making it and when I came back home, the whole pan was licked clean - my husband loved it. I used chicken thigh instead and doubled the sherry and marsala portion to make it more saucy.

This actually tasted like the bourban pecan chicken from this site, which is excellent.  I think next time I won't coat the chicken, I'll grill it first.  Overall taste was really good though.

My husband called this a "weekly winner" and said he can't wait until I make it again.  I won't mind either, considering how easy it was to make. I dislike pounding chicken, so I used chicken tenderloin instead and skipped that step.  I threw in some Italian seasoning with the flour mixture, some garlic when I threw the chicken in the pan, and I doubled the sauce.  Next time I will at double the mushrooms as well.  My husband went back for more and there are no leftovers.  This was great, especially the sauce. Mmmmm.

I followed some of the other reviews to use 1/2 the butter.  I also removed the chicken & mushrooms after letting simmer and thickened the gravy with a bit of flour & water.  I served this with the garlic mashed potatoes from this site and it was a HIT!!  Thank you!

This Chicken is out of this world.  So simple to make, but such an elegant dish.  The sauce thickens without you having to do anything.  My whole family enjoyed this. This goes great with Basil Orzo!

My family loved this receipe.  It didn't produce as much gravy as I thought, but being that most in my household do not like mushrooms and I omitted them, it came out to be just a great chicken dish.

I used parsley instead of oregeno and didn't use marsala wine.  I used Pastene Cream Sherry only.  You can find this particular sherry at some liquor stores.  The marsala was fabulous!  Thank you.

Very good recipe.  Very tasty and easy to make.  I fried the chicken in the oil and butter - and put them aside and made the sauce - let it simmer for 5 minutes and then added the chicken back into the pan and simmered another 5 mintues.......that was the only thing I did differently than what the original recipe called for.  I will make this again.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe! I followed it exactly, except I removed the chicken from the pan at the end and let the sauce cook down for another 10 minutes, which made it a little thicker. It was delicious and even rivalled the Chicken Marsala at our favorite Italian restaurant! I'll definitely be making this again!

This was delicious.  I did use a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but that was personal preference.  Also, right before serving, I threw in some capers and diced roma tomatoes and heated through.  I think the capers helped liven up the sauce a bit.  Served this over capellini.

Thought this was great. My hubby made sure I put this one in my recipe box!! A definite keeper. I added a bit of chicken broth to increase the sauce along with a bit more marsala wine. As good as you can get in a restaurant, thanks so very much Lisa!

This was a great recipe that everyone loved.  I try to save my five-star ratings for dishes that knock my socks off (this one hit slightly under that), but this gets a five because of it's simplicity to prepare.  Very easy (pretty quick, too) and very good.

I thought this was very good. I used a bit less olive oil and butter, and added extra mushrooms. I would prefer a thicker sauce however. i made raoasted garlic mashed potatoes with this, and the sauce poured on top was delicious. I would make again.

I really would like to give this recipe a 5, but I had to tweak it a little. I  sprinkled some sugar  with the flour to add sweetness. I found there wasn't enough sauce or mushrooms. Other than that, it had a great flavor, even w/o the sherry (I didn't have it). Will make again. Yum!

Very good.  Didn't have sherry.  I will make it again - with the sherry next time.  My 2yo and 4yo loved it.

I've never made Chicken Marsala before and my boyfriend is not only a picky eater but used to be a cook as well.  Both him and my 10 year old daughter LOVED this dish.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions, doubled the sheri and marsala, and then added cornstarch at the end.  It came out GREAT.  We will defintely make this one again.

I made this recipe for a work potluck and had to adjust the recipe for 30 people.  It turned out great!  Everyone complimented the food and wanted the recipe. I'll definitely make it again.

Followed recipe except for adding more mushrooms & used chicken tenderloins, chicken was delicious, but sauce was thin, added a tsp of cornstarch to thicken and left the lid off after turning the chicken in the sauce. Easy and tasty.

This is the best chicken marsala I have ever had.  I will only eat the marsala I make.  I added a lot to the recipe though.  I doubled the sauce so I could put it over penne and added tomatoes and some lightly wilted spinach.

This recipe was delicious and very easy.  I added a little bit of heavy cream at the end to make the sauce creamier, but I kept everything else the same.

I fixed this for friends and they loved it! The only thing was the breading on the chicken was too soggy. But I will definately make this again.

The flavor of the sauce was great but I had problems with the breading falling off during cooking and all I was left with was bland chicken.  Probably just an error on my part but worth another try...

Great flavor but use a little less oil/butter for a less greasy sauce. Otherwise, it's great!

I liked this; my husband didn't seem to (although he would not tell me so).  It was a bit sweeter than I like Chicken Marsala to be, and the sauce was much too thin.  I didn't alter the recipe at all, and would try other Chicken Marsala recipes before even considering making this one again.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe...I omitted the butter completely and I did not use Sherry, I just added a little more Marsala.  I took other reviewers advice and doubled up on the mushrooms, added some fresh garlic, and served it over garlic and basil angel hair pasta!  I served it with fresh grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese to top…it was delicious and very elegant!

My husbands favorite meal is Chicken Marsala.  So much so that we had it at our wedding.  This recipe is quick and EASY!  We both loved it. 

I did make a few changes :)  I doubles the sauce and made a rue, then served it over angel hair pasta instead of rice.

You must try this recipe.  Its devine!

This was a great recipe - even my picky  kids loved it.  The only thing I would mention is if you don't like the texture of mushrooms you might want to saute them in the beginning with the chicken instead of waiting to the end to add them.

Fabulous. I  just about triple the ingredients for sauce and use two pounds mushrooms. I add about a heaping tablespoon to thicken the juice into sauce. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Didn't have real Marsala so used Marsala cooking wine instead.  It didn't seem to make a difference though, the house smelled amazing and the taste was out of this world!

This was great because it was so easy to make, and the chicken was perfectly moist and tender. The only changes I made were that I added a little garlic powder and onion powder to the flour coating and I used baby bella mushrooms instead of white ones. However, I wouldn't receommend making those changes because there's no need to add spice, and bellas have a robust flavor that doesn't need to be added to this already flavorful sauce. I too added some flour to thicken the sauce, and it was delicious! I'll definitely make this again soon.

This was pretty good.  I thought it needed a little bit of salt, but it was still good overall.  I have few recipes I make "by the book", so of course I added my touch to it and added 2 garlic cloves, 1/4 cup chopped onion and 1 tablespoon fresh thyme & parsley to the butter/oil before I added the chicken.  It turned out yummy!

This is a 5-star recipe!!  I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved at how good it was.  One guest even said it was the bext Marsala he's ever had!  I didn't change the recipe at all except for omitting the salt (personal preference).  Thank you so much for making me look good!

I have tried Chicken Marsala at 2 different restaurants.. One I LOVE (at Carrabbas) and One I don't (Olive Garden).  THIS recipe reminded me more of Olive Garden's style.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would NOT coat my chicken breasts in flour nor would I cook it in so much olive oil or butter.  I didn't find this to have the taste I would be looking for.   Not enough there for me!  
I really was expecting more with so many wonderful ratings!

This is the best chicken marsala recipe I've ever tasted. It's simplicity of preparation is definitely a plus. Chicken marsala is one of my husband's favorite dishes, and i've made this one so manty times that I have memorized the recipe.

Wow, this was really great, you can't go wrong.  This is definetely a superb recipe because it is fancy enough for company, yet easy enough for a quick, thrown together dinner.  I too added one spring onion, as well as some milk (instead of cream) mixed with flour to thicken the sauce which helped a lot, I would highly recommend this simple solution to adding more sauce.  Mine also turned out a bit salty so I just added water until the sauce acheived perfection.  Yum!  Can't wait to make again, maybe tomorrow night...

This is probably the best chicken recipe I have ever tasted!  Even my 16 year old son who is not a huge fan of chicken loved it.  The secret is definitely in pounding the chicken--it will not be nearly as tender if you skip this step.  A great recipe to make for guests.

Excellent!!  I didn't have any sherry so I used chicken broth -- very good!!  Next time I will somehow make more sauce...we served this with pasta and there wasn't quite enough sauce to go around.

This was one of the first recipes I made from this website and I still make it all the time!  I was surprised to find how easy and quick this recipe is.  It doesn't come out looking too pretty but it sure is satisfying served along with some garlic mashed potatoes.  I use real marsala wine and sherry from the bottle shop, fresh mushrooms and I add fresh garlic and minced spanish onion for an extra kick.

three words...won der ful!!!! the mushrooms were delicious and the sauce was out of this world. i think next time i'll have to add a little more of the wines so that i'll have a little more of the sauce to spoon over the chicken when it's done, because there wasn't alot left when it was done. but my family loved it. we will definintely be making this again. thanks a bunch for this one!

I hate to eat chicken, but this recipe changed that.  This was amazing.  I doubled the sauce and did not use mushrooms.  The chicken was so tender!Amazing recipe!  There were only two of us eating this and there were no leftovers!

It was okay.  Not amazing, but not terrible.  I'm giving it a second chance though, since the Marsala wine I used was crappy.  My boyfriend loved it, but I thought it could have had a bit more flavor.  Make sure you use a quality Marsala!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I took the advice from other reviews - Florio brand sweet marsala wine, less butter and olive oil and LOTS of spices - minced garlic, more oregano, little bit of basil and thyme, plus I used heavy cream to make the sauce thicker and simmered a bit longer.  Excellent taste...and not too time consuming.  This is definitely my favorite recipe from the website!!  Thanks Lisa!!

This recipe was great.  I added in a 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and it was amazing! I also used a little extra salt, oregano and added in some garlic powder to the flour mixture.  So good! Next time, I may add in some sauteed onion rings and use less butter.

Wow!  This dish is amazing.  Perfect for special occasions, and so easy to make.  I cut the butter and oil in half, doubled the mushrooms, doubled the wine and sherry, and added cornstarch mixed with cold water at the very end to thicken the sauce.  Instead of using chicken breasts, I used chicken tenderloins which are flatter and cook faster and more evenly.  Thanks for this recipe!

Very easy!  My wife loved it so much she had me make it again 2 days later for her sister.  Used 3/4c Marsala wine without the Sherry.  Added crushed garlic and other seasoning.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Incredible!

Quick and easy to make!  More importantly tasted fabulous!!  I used one carton of pre-sliced mushrooms and used the recommended amount of Marsala and sherry and added an additional 1/2 of each(i.e. 3/4 C. Marsala vs. 1/2 C.).  Husband and kids loved it too!!

Excellent recipe.  My family loves this dish.  I like it because of how quick and easy it is!  I use wheat flour  and non cholestrol margerine to make it a little healthier.  It doesn't change the flavor of this great recipe.

Took the advise of other reviewers and substituted the cooking sherry for the chicken stock.  I also added some shallots.  Very easy recipe!!

This recipe is excellent. I've had my fair share of bad recipes from websites, but this is by far the best.  I also had to add a little bit of a thickening agent to mine also, I like a creamier sauce.  I ate this at a restaurant in Atlanta and had to replicate it when I returned home to Chicago.  I served mine with Parmesan Risotto just like the restaurant. Excellent!!!

this recipe is very good, but lacks flavor as is. Added 1 teaspoon 0f oregano plus 1 each of basil and thmye and tablespoon of italian seasoning used seasoming salt for salt and 1teaspoon of white pepper instead of the black also doubled the flour and the wines to make more sauce. Browned chicken and put in oven to finsh cooking while finishing sauce. This way the coating stayed on chicken. Put chicken back in sauce and served over fettuicine.

This was a big hit! I did not think my husband would like it as he does not like to try new foods. But he loved it. I did take the suggestions from others and added more spices and added half and half to the sauce to thicken. I served it over Angel Hair pasta.

Quick and satisfying.  To spice things up, try rolling the chix in herbs first before coating in flour, I added dried basil and pepper.  Also sautéed about 4 cloves of crushed garlic and half an onion before adding the mushrooms, then some four to thicken the sauced at the end.  Turned out very tasty, thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I have mixed feelings with this recipe.  It was easy to prepare and not to time consuming and the chicken was juicy and tender.  I thought there was definitely something missing regarding the taste though.  It wasn't as flavorful as other chicken marsalas I've had.  I do have to say I heated it up the next day for lunch with a lot of parmasean cheese and it was much better.

This was really easy and tasted like it was from a restaurant.  My six year old didn't care for the wine flavor, but my 9 year old told him "That's because it's gourmet little man!"  I'll make this one again... and give the 6 year old a PBJ! :)

We loved this recipe!  I added garlic salt to the flour mixture, and doubled the sauce. I served the chicken and sauce on top of angelhair pasta, and the sauce went great with the pasta. Next time, I may add white wine in addition to the other 2 wines, and add oregano to the chicken.  This was our first time trying Chicken Marsala, and we will definitely use this recipe again.

This sounds weird but I have made this recipe many times and each time I made some strange but good substitutions. Instead of sherry I have used white wine and 1tsp sugar and the second time no wine so I used a 1/4 c of cola I had plently of marsala wine just not the second liquor It adds to the depth of the marsala taste.

This is a good standard recipe, although a little bland (as Chicken Marsala so often tend to be).  It could be my fault, being as I only buy the cheap grocery store marsala wine...probably the better variety of wine you use the more flavor you will get.  I also recommend adding at least twice the garlic and a few Tbsp of cream moments before serving to thicken the sauce.

We had no sherry so I used only Marsala.  My daughter said that this was better than the Chicken Marsala servet at her favorite Italian restaurant!  We served it over garlic mashed potatoes.  What a hit.

Great recipe...b/c I'm watching my food intake, I subsutited melba toast for flour, and oven baked the chicken instead of frying (eliminates the butter and oil).  It still tasted really great.

This is a good way to stretch chicken if you're on a budget.  I used four breasts, but after pounding they were huge so I cut into 4 pieces each.  It could easily serve 6 if you had good side dishes.  I had to do the chicken in two batches, but used the same butter and oil both times (and I halved that).  I took the chicken out to a platter after simmering for 10 min and then the sauce simmered alone for a bit and didn't look thick enough so I added a little cornstarch-- but I wish I hadn't.  Next time I'm going to leave it thin and put it over the chicken and also ladle a little on each serving.  I served with vegetable cous cous and steamed broccoli.  Definitely a keeper!  Tasted restaurant quality!

This was a great, quick, easy meal that had a lot of oomph.  I liked that it can be served as a weekday meal or used for company dinners.  The recipe was great and I changed very little about it.  The coating for the chicken was good, but I tend to like Nature's Seasoning instead of plain salt and pepper.  It adds a kick of garlic and onion.  I increased the oregano to taste -- probably doubling the stated portion.  I let the butter froth before adding the meat to clarify it and used quality olive oil to achieve that rich flavor. I didn't have sherry in the house (how did THAT happen??), so I simply left it out.  Used a GOOD marsala wine recommended by the local liquor store owner.  I did add a bit more of this than the recipe called for to increase the sauce, as well as some low sodium chicken broth.  After removing the chicken, thickened the sauce with a touch of corn starch for that extra body gravy.  Wow.  Quick!  Yummy!  Husband loved it!

This is so easy.  I used chicken cutlets because that's all I had in the house.  I also put a little parmesan cheese in the flour mixture.  Also, used a little more marsala and sherry because of prior reviews, but I don't think I needed to!!

great, one of the best chicken recipes on this site. 
i also pound out the chicken breast to make it flatter, i double both the wines so there's more sauce and at the end i add a cornstarch slurry to thicken up the sauce.  fabulous!  easy, not alcohol-y tasting and super easy.  serve over pasta.

I made this for my boyfriend who loves Chicken Marsala, and he loved it. He said it tasted just like a restaurant. I did add italian seasoning, garlic salt and a bit of minced garlic. Next time, I will triple the mushrooms, and the sauce because I served it over fettuccine.
I loved how easy this way, and fast!

Pretty good.  Next I'll double up on the mushrooms and add some garlic to the sauce and maybe more salt.  It was alittle bland, but over all good.

As for rating a recipe, I think about several aspects.  It has to be easy to understand when reading or implementing it, the items have to be reasonably obtainable, and overall taste must be fanstastic.  This recipe exceeds all my specifics, and for that matter, my expectations.  Well done and great tasting.

Yum.  Added a bit of chicken stock because I like saucey sauces.  Used sliced portabellas for something different.  On permanent rotation.  Very kid-friendly as long as they like mushrooms.  Served over pasta.  Thank you.

I served this for company the other night and it was a big hit.  I don't usually finish an entire chicken breast but at some point I looked down and realized my plate was clean! Even my picky 20-month-old liked it.  Based on previous recommendations, I halved the butter and doubled the wine.  I also added a little bit of cream (maybe 1/4 cup?) and flour at the end to thicken the sauce up a little bit so it would cling to pasta.  This was excellent and so easy to make.  I'll definitely make this one again.

This is AWESOME!  I have ade it two times and even my finicky kids LOVE it! I did add some garlic powder and fresh or chopped cilantro or parsley with the mushrooms add a little extra flavor and color.  This is a keeper for sure...

I've tried several recipes from this website and this one is by far one of my all-time favorites! The sherry and marsala together are what sets this recipe apart from other Chicken Marsala recipes. No substitutions are needed. I serve mine with home-made red-skinned mashed potatoes and peas. Thanks for the recipe Lisa!

This was an excellent meal. My only suggestion would be to simmer not quite as long. But either way that taste is wonderful.

This was delicious (and ridiculously easy)! Everyone loved it. One notoriously finicky eater praised it repeatedly. One guest likened it to the Chicken Marsala at his favorite New Orleans restaurant. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.

The best chicken marsala that I have had, and I made it. I added some flour and a bit of heavy whipping cream to the sauce when it was done.  I cooking just the sauce for a minute or two and it thickened up great.

Thanks for the recipe!

I don't usually like chicken marsala in the restaurant, but I decided to give this a try.  Boy, was I glad that I did!  This was really good.  The chicken was so tender and juicy!  I only added a little MSG to give a little twist to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely Delicious!!  My husband and 4 kids just loved this!  I didn't make enough for them!  I did add one garlic clove to the oil and butter, but that's all I changed.  My hubby even mopped up the gravy in the pan with bread.  Thanks for a terrific and easy recipe!

OK in all fairness I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I used a very good quality Merlot for the sauce instead of the Marsala and Sherry.  I also added 2 cloves minced garlic and a 1/2 cup heavy cream at the end as one reviewer suggested.  The sauce was a pink/fushia color!  Looked a little odd on the plate.  My husband and son thought it was alright but not a recipe to add to the Family Favorites.  Sorry Lisa, but this one just wasn't a keeper for us.

This is a very impressive and tasty dish that is simple to make; it takes little time to prepare and is well worth it.  I made it for my family but I could easily have prepared it for a dinner party, and I likely will.

This recipe is a keeper...So easy & tasty, and has a nice presentation that makes it company-fare.  Flavors are subtle..so next time I may add additional seasonings.

This was pretty good!In addition to the oregano already called for, I used a tablespoon of fresh, chopped oregano. I needed more fluid in the chicken as well as some depth so I added chicken bouillon (1 cup) with a teaspoon of cornstarch.

I was less than thrilled.  I am surprised this recipe received 5 stars... needs more flavor.  Next time I might add some garlic, more wine, simmer longer, and add more herbs.  Very different from the chicken marsala I have had in restaurants.

I made this with my stepdaughter. We both love mushrooms so we ended up using four 8oz containers of mushrooms. My husband hates vegetables so I made his own with no mushrooms. This recipe was a hit with everyone!

Not my family's taste at all. I am really sorry I doubled the Marsala and Sherry as some posters suggested. Maybe if I hadn't it would have been edible. Lisa, please don't be angry with me. I am sure that this is a great recipe, just not our taste.

Nice simple recipe, although proportions seemed a little off to me. The chicken should really simmer in a GOOD amount of wine to soak up the flavor. I suggest serving it with some extra sauce with a tad of cornstarch added to thicken up the sauce. Otherwise, delicious meal, beautiful colors!!

I thought this was ok.  My husband didn't like it (but he's picky).  I should have listened to other reviewers and used less oil.  I would have liked more of a less oily sauce.  I might expirment with this again.

I had been craving Chicken Marsala for a LONG time and inhaled this.  It tasted exactly as I had hoped/remembered.  Definitely double the sauce, and thicken if necessary.  Also, I pounded the chicken so it was tender, and I think that made a huge difference.  Served it with spaghetti.  THANKS.

I took the recommendation of others and used portabella mushrooms, 15 cloves of roasted garlic, cut the oil to 1 1/2 tbsp, (no butter) BUT forgot to add extra salt - it really needs 1/2 tsp in the sauce.  This recipe is restaurant quality.  AMAZING

This is a pretty good version.  I think it might be a little better if the mushrooms were sauteed a little first.  It seems like a lot of alcohol when you add the wine & the sherry, but it tastes fine.  I did add flour to the sauce at the end to thicken which helps alot.

I am not a new cook but a very boring one. I am just starting to try the recipes on this website to lend some variety.  I thought this one was very good.  The family loved it.  Some changes for next time: more mushrooms, less butter and oil, more salt and pepper and maybe some fresh garlic.  I served it with fresh asparagus and rice pilaf.  A lovely, easy meal!  The good wine and sherry is the key as well as really tenderized chicken.

This was the most delicious Chicken Marsala recipe I've used.  I've made this on a few occassions when people have come over for dinner and it's never failed to get rave reviews.  I must have given this recipe out to about 5 other people already.  Also, I was making a huge batch of it for a large dinner party and I accidentally left some chicken simmering longer than the recipe stated -- and this this was the serving that seemed to have the best flavor, without becoming dry at all!

Okay... so I have to tell you that I have just recently started cooking.  My husband told me last night after dinner that this was far better than restuarant quality!  And that my cooking has really improved over the last few months (thanks to finding allrecipies.com!!!).  So this is a must.  It was so easy to make, and was wonderful.  I didn't have the Sherry, but I used an 1/8th of a cup of red wine vinigar.  Turned out beautiful!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was really good !!!! Next time I would not put as much sherry and maybe a little more chicken boullion instead but it was great.  I made enough for left overs and it was so easy to reheat as well.  Will definitely make it again.

A most excellent and simple recipe!  Didn't have the sherry on hand, but added extra marsala.  Also added a little flour/water mixture to the sauce for a little thickening.  If you're wanting leftovers, make alot or forget it!!!!  Will make again, and with the sherry...can't wait!

Excellent marsala recipe. I'd definitely cut back on the butter next time as it was a bit greasy, especially as leftovers.

My husband loves marsala -- I had never made it before, and used this recipe for a first try.  He loved it.  I doubled mushrooms -- and he still asked "do we have more mushrooms???"  Only think -- was heavy on oil/butter -- was happy to see from other reviewers, you can cut this and increase liquids and it's still great...will try that next time.  Thumbs up!

This recipe turned out great!  Very tasty and very easy to prepare.  I cut the amount of butter and oil in half and I tripled the mushrooms and doubled the marsala wine and sherry.  I didn't pound down the chicken enough but it still turned out great.  My dinner guests ate up every last bite. I made it with rice and steamed broccoli and carrots. Definitely a keeper.

Outstanding taste and ease of preparation.  I read somewhere to avoid "cooking wines" and use the table variety instead, I made this recipe twice, once with a table marsala and once with a cooking marsala.  The table marsala was by far the better of the two dishes.

This recipe is FAST and FAB. I doubled the recipe for the marsala sauce and served it over the chicken and some angel hair pasta.  Toss together a salad, warm some garlic bread and then sit back and wait for the compliments.  Thanks, Lisa, for
a SUPERIOR recipe.

Will definitely make it again. Easy to make.

While I liked the mix of wines (the sherry was a nice touch), overall the recipe was too greasy for my family's taste.

Once I found the wines (I live in a small town) the recipe was easy to follow, took little time, and tasted scrumptuous!  Even my meat and potatoe husband loved it.

The best.  Easy to fix and classy to serve.  Present with fettucine for an eye-appealing and palate satisfying main dish.  This recipe works well for warm-ups later, but good luck on having any leftovers.  The Marsala wine adds a very special flavor for casual and dressy dinners.

Cook some white rice while chicken is cooking.  When rice is done, stir in one can cream of mushroom soup, remove from heat and leave covered. Let stand until chicken is done. Real good addition to this really good recipe.

This was great! My husband & 4 year old loved it too.  I added another cup of mushrooms and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.  Serve over fettuccine...YUMM!

Very easy recipe. Nice taste one of the better Chicken Marsala recipes I've tried. I added a bit more of the olive oil, butter and doubled the wine and sherry to make extra sauce to pour over homemade pasta.

Made this on New Years Eve for my husband and he loved it.  Substituted portabello mushrooms for regular one and that added some flavor to it.  This will definitely be made again in our house!!!

Made this last night,  used brown rice for the base,  made in instant pot 1-1 ratio 15 manual 5 min natural release, then quick release, no heat after the 15, was perfect for two cups.  Anyway, added shallots to the sherry and marsala, mushroom step, just that bit more flavor.  Don’t be scared to add more marsala and sherry if needed.  All in all good dinner.  Of course I had to have spinach.

The recipe should specify to use sweet or dry Marsala wine. I used dry, which must be the wrong option. Also the wine sauce never thickened like the sauce I’ve had in restaurants.  I added a bit of flour to thicken it & used twice the mushrooms since they  cooked down so much.  This recipe needs to be tweaked for improvement.

I followed some other recommendations (using 3/4 Marsala wine, no sherry, and dusting the chicken breasts with the flour/salt/rosemary in a Ziplock bag) and it came out very light and flavorful! I had my doubts about sautéing the one side of chicken until light brown and then cooking the other raw side with all the Marsala wine present, but it worked out great! I let the raw side simmer on medium heat for 8min and then flipped. I let it simmer on that side for another 3-4 minutes and the chicken came out soft and juicy.

One of the tastiest dishes I’ve made in a while.. easy too!  I made it with a side of high fiber pasta with garlic, oil and parm cheese.  Better than going out for Italian!

This is a very easy and tasty chicken marsala recipe!! I made it for my husband and I and it was wonderful!! I used the thin breasts because I don't like pounding the chicken,  and I didn't have any sherry,  so I just used extra marsala wine and it was fantastic ! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis! Thank you for the recipe!!

It isn't the absolute best chicken marsala ever, but it's close! However, given the simpleness of the recipe, the ease, and the quick prep time, it's huge on bang for the buck. I will make it again!

I modified this recipe a little bit. I just put a half a cup of the cooking marsala wine and left out the Sherry. After the chicken and mushrooms were done, I took them out of the liquid and put it in a measuring cup and beat in 1 tablespoon of flour until it was smooth then I poured it back in the pan and let it thicken. When I served it, I topped it with the cream sauce and mushrooms. It was very delicious and Looked great.

I managed to please a picky eater with this recipe, and believe me, I'm NO cook! So easy to make & highly tweakable. I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano (it was all I had in the house) and it turned out great. As I said, I'm no cook, so I'm really glad I took the time to watch the video; otherwise I wouldn't have known to tenderize the chicken! Novices, take note. Minimal seasoning, lots of flavor and easy to make; you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Super easy recipe with very good results.  I served it with mashed potatoes. I also added some cream to pan juices after removing chicken from pan. This made a more substantial mushroom gravy but the pan juices with the mushrooms would be yummy also.

Made it according to the recipe, but eliminated the port (as suggested by other reviewers). Used frozen sliced mushrooms. Quick, easy, tender and tasty.

Very easy and tasty.  I highly recommend using Taylor Marsala wine (found in supermarkets ...Publix in Florida... Instead of the Holland House Marsala cooking wine).  I substitute Sherry with Chicken Stock sometimes depending on what I have in my pantry and it's still a hit with others. 

Fyi...the flour mix amount listed is just enough for 4 chicken pieces.

I have made this recipe as is and rated it 5 Stars.
 Now due to a Chronic illness, I am on an Anti-Inflammatory diet. I need to eat Gluten free, Organic and Low Glycemic. 
I used Organic almond flour to coat organic chicken. Used organic mushrooms & butter.
It came out delicious! 
I cooked GF/Organic pasta and covered it with finished Chicken Marsala!
It's still 5 Stars in my Book!

I just made this. It was easy to make. I used ingredients I had on hand, when meant chicken thighs instead of breasts, and some Riesling and a tiny bit of sake I had  instead of the Marsala I didn't have. It was delicious.

A decent marsala recipe. 
a couple things I did - I used a gallon sized ziploc bag to coat the chicken in the flour seasoning. I also bought good marsala and sherry wine (not the ones specific for cooking). I removed the chicken from the pan after browning before adding the mushrooms and wine, then gently rested the chicken on top, covered, and finish cooking. 
I served it with egg noodles and mashed potatoes - the marsala sauce was a delicious gravy for the potatoes.

This recipe is aahhhhmazing! I always try any new recipe as given and this dish has made it into our dinner rotation because it is literally that good! It’s been delicious since the first time I made it! Now I double the sauce to serve it over pasta and add a bit of diced onion when I throw the mushrooms in but that is it! This is a fantastic recipe! I highly suggest you try it!

I have made this recipe for years! I have made a few changes in those years...I remove the chicken after browning and saute the mushrooms with half of a thinly sliced sweet onion and two garlic cloves. I also double the liquid and add salt to taste. Served over thin spaghetti with the Marsala sauce :) Yummy!   My picky eater, who is now 20 and still picky asks, for this all the time.

First time ever making this. Recipe was so easy to follow and was delicious. The only thing I did differently was double the Wine and sherry to make extra sauce. I also made garlic mashed potatoes from a recipe I found here too.

This is a 4-star recipe as written but a 5-star recipe if you include the modifications in the comments. Definitely double the wine volumes.

As others have suggested, removing the chicken to saute the mushrooms in the pan; adding some garlic after the mushrooms have sauteed a bit; and using some of the leftover breading flour to thicken the sauce are great suggestions. (I also added some half-and-half at the end, but I'm not sure it made much of a difference.) I also simply sliced my chicken breasts thinner instead of pounding them.  I love recipes that are a great base for building on, and this is one of them. The fact that you can go from start to finish in about half an hour means this recipe will enter my family's dinner rotation.

This is the second time I try this. My husband loved it and told me this recipe was a keeper. The first time I followed the recipe faithfully. This time I added a bit more salt, pepper and oregano to the flour to give the chicken more flavor. I was able to make 6 thinly sliced chicken breast fillets with the same amount of sauce. Because I had extra minced garlic from a pasta I made to accompany this and I read a review that mentioned they had added minced garlic when browning the chicken, I decided to throw it in. This was at the end, however, when all the ingredients were simmering. I’m so glad I did! It enhanced the flavor nicely. Next time I’ll add the garlic at the beginning. Overall this is a delicious recipe that I’ll be doing over and over again.

I used two thighs. The result was a bit oilier than the chicken breast. I'm chalking that up to the skin being on it. I did remove the bone. I used crimini mushrooms wish were awesome. Planning on using this as filling for pot pie this winter! Happy cooking all!

I made the recipe as is. I loved how quick and easy it was to prepare. The taste was not as savory as I would have liked. Next time, I will try making it with a stronger tasting mushroom. White mushrooms didn’t quite do the job.

Ohhh, so good! And east to make. I halved the recipe the first time & the amount of sauce was perfect. The next time I made full recipe but could’ve used more sauce. Plus I made garlic angel hair pasta by cooking pasta with fresh garlic in water. Yummy meal!

Wonderful recipe- quick and easy as well as tasty. Made it for a family get together- everyone raved about it.  Only changes I made was to double the mushrooms and put fresh spinach on the top at the end.  Next time I will put the whole bag instead of half- 
We will definitely make this again.

This was a fast and easy dish.  I am making it again tonight, but using my cast iron pan rather than my non stick.  I want the chicken to brown up and release more flavor.

New family favorite! Easy to make and delicious. All the ingredients are staples  you can find in the cupboard (except the Marsala). I omitted the sherry and doubled the Marsala. After the chicken was cooked, I removed them from the pan and added 1/2 C. heavy whip cream  to thicken the sauce. Served them with mashed potatoes, yummy!

I followed the recipe as written. I found it to be a little bland and thought the sauce was a little too thin. On the plus side it was quick and easy and works well as a weeknight meal.

I changed it up. Removed meat after browning, Deglazed with 1/4 cup dry sherry, 3/4 cup Marsala,  added mushroom, lowered heat,  added 1/4 cup heavy cream, salt, pepper brought to a boil, then replaced meat, lowered heat, covered and simmered. To finish, rolled a knob of butter in the flour and added to sauce stirring until blended. Fantastic!

I made this dish with prepared chicken cutlets. It was a little dry for my taste. I will either add broth or more Marsala and sherry so I can have more sauce. Most of the alcohol evaporated!

I agree that this is the best Marsala recipe. I've been using it for several months and can't wait to eat it again. I fixed it for Sunday family dinner and several asked for the recipe.

This is a great recipe with a lot of great taste. I cooked it for my daughter and all she had was cornstarch instead of flour but it still turned out great. I let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Yummy. Thank you

I had everything but the cooking sherry, so I substituted chicken broth.  I made 8 cutlets and tripled the sauce.  Served with a side of pasta.  It was great.  Family loved it.

Chicken was so tender and juicy, sauce had a delicious flavor. Husband said he wants to have this for dinner A LOT and even the picky kids were easily appeased with some of the chicken with some cheese melted on top instead of the mushrooms. Finally, it was fast and dirtied only one pan. YUM!

It was surprisingly good given how simple it is to make. We removed the chicken when it was done and cooked the mushrooms a bit longer and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The dish needed more salt for our taste, but this is a great go-to recipe. Once the Marsala is in the pantry, it is an easy, elegant dish to make in short notice.

Great recipe! My first time making chicken marsala, it's one of my favorite meals. The only changes I made was adding fresh parsley and chopped garlic (my family loves it) to the mushrooms, and 1/4 chicken broth to the wine. I did thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstarch. This was really good with bow tie pasta and tossed salad. Recipe will be a keeper.

This was excellent and everyone loved it.  Next time I will double the sauce.  We like more sauce.  I did add a little 1/2&1/2 to the sauce to make it a little creamier.  It's great with or without the 1/2 &1/2.  Definitely will make again!

I'm not a fan of modifying recipes and then rating them, but I hate, hate, hate mushrooms.  Fantastic recipe, with minor changes.  I used thin garlic slices instead of mushrooms.  I also skipped the Sherry, replaced with extra Marsala, and, like other comments, I added a little heavy cream and flour to make a roux, for a creamer sauce.  I will be making this again! Thank you.

This recipe is perfect! The only thing I did differently was marinate the chicken breast for one hour prior to cooking.

This was an easy and delicious dish to make.  I removed the chicken after browning it, added a couple of splashes of heavy cream in with the mushrooms, stirred it up and returned the chicken a couple of minutes later to simmer covered.  Due to cooking for 12, made it in 4 batches and kept portions in a foil pan in a 180 degree oven until ready to serve.  Served over angel hair-reserved a cup of the water the pasta boiled in and added that back to the pasta before spooning over some of the marsala sauce.  Served a party of 12 with rave reviews.

I love it and have made it several times.  I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth last time to give us more gravy.  Wonderful!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  No modifications needed.  After all how can we give a true review unless we fallow the recipe 100%.   I served it with Sarah's Rice Pilaf (Yummy) and peas.  It was a great dinner.  Try it, You'll like it!

This recipe was pretty easy, and turned out great (even with the lower quality Marsala). I caught some thin cutlets on sale to save time. I used more mushrooms, seasoned my chicken before flouring, and let the mushrooms sautee a bit before adding the wine.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and everyone loved the dish.

I loved this recipe! I did make a few changes as was suggested. I didn't ise any sherry. I increased the amount of mushrooms to 3x. I also 3x the sauce. I added in some half and half to make the sauce a bit more creamy. I thickened using some cornstarch. It turned out wonderful.

I followed the recipe pretty close just doubled the mushrooms. We loved It! Next time I will double or triple the sauce too. I might add some garlic and pearl onions or serve it with roasted potatoes and onions.

Tasty! There was not much gravy. We did about 2 cups of loosely packed sliced mushrooms. I love mushrooms and could have used more, but was probably good for the average person.

Added more mushrooms, spliced the chicken breast flatwise, 
Covered the pan and simmered for 10 minutes. It’s good with a fried egg up the next morning!

Yes, it was perfect for a mid week hearty and tasty meal. I used more mushrooms than in the recipe and the chicken was juicy and delicious.

Used 3/4 cup Marsala wine instead of sherry and it was yummy. Sliced up the chicken after browning it to add more flavor and cook faster.

I liked the flavor of this a lot but the texture of the chicken breasts always takes away from it being a great meal.  Now instead of breading the chicken I just season it and grill it and then put it in the sauce.  It makes a much nicer looking dish.

I blended this recipe with Chicken Marsala II and other people's comments by adding 1 can chicken broth and 1 c. cream to extend the sauce. I also sauteed pancetta, 2 cloves garlic, and 1/4 c. chopped onion for flavoring in the base of the sauce. A pinch of Italian Seasoning and Parsley helped give it a boost and added a bit of green to the sauce.  After frying the coated chicken in olive oil, I kept it warming in the oven while I made the sauce, then brought it all together with angel hair pasta. Delish.

Made 2 simple changes; added 1/4 cup half n half, didn't use any Sherry.  I didn't measure the mushrooms but used a bunch. I would recommend using a lot of mushrooms! All that much better! This recipe turns out very high end like and yet is so quick and easy. Definitely will make again and again! A suggestion for those that don't want to pound the chicken, when partially defrosted, slice very thin slices. Works like a charm.

I made this recipe I did not add the sherry most recipes for Chicken Marsala do not call for it. I pretty much did everything else but I also followed another recipe which added chicken stock and whipping cream. I did everything including browning chicken in pan but once i made my mushrooms and Marsala sauce I put in baking dish and baked remainder of the time and let me tell you I made this for 10 people first time ever and everyone kept raving about how delicious it was even my husband said he was very impressed how good it was for my first time makin it. I used a good Marsala sweet wine.

Super delicious and easy to make.  Didn't have Sherry so used 1/2  cup of  marsala cooking wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and then about 1/4 cup of half and half.  I don't drink wine and so only had marsala cooking wine.  Many people have  said to go the extra mile and buy some Marsala and not to use the cooking wine...I'm here to tell you that marsala cooking wine is just fine and it was phenomenal!!!

This was really good and quite easy.  I buy the thin sliced chicken breast which makes it easy.  Only thing I would change is the olive oil quantity was way too much in my opinion because the sauce was then very oily when done.

To me this tasted very plain.  Not sure if my masala and sherry were good brand or what.  I added a bit of salt at the end to try and bring out some flavor but it didn't help much.  What brands do you use?

Super tender & flavorful.   I will double mushrooms, marsala & sherry next time, & may use some of the leftover flour mixture to thicken the sauce.

This was easier than Chef John’s recipe and just as good. I followed one of the suggestions of increasing marsala to 3/4 cup and omitting the sherry as I didn’t have any on hand. The chicken was tender, flavorful and was great served on egg noodles. It was ready in a half hour.

We LOVED this recipe. Great flavor and easy to make. We made it for a “fancy” (my kids term) family dinner and everyone gobbled it up and used bread to mop up the sauce. Definitely will make again.

I add  fresh garlic cloves diced when adding the Marsala cooking wine.  Also, double the Marsala and do not use the sherry to save on buying multiple products and comes out great either way.

Very good recipe. I had to make it with gluten-free flour and that worked out just fine. I did add some minced shallots and chopped sparsely and basil to the recipe, about a third of a cup of each,  and used all marsala wine instead of using the sherry.  I also doubled the mushrooms as others had suggested, more making me merrier. Also added a little garlic salt, and finished with about 1/3 cup heavy cream.

We loved it.   I used white zin and vermouth instead of marsala and sherry and it tuned out great.   You have to love 30 minute dishes that taste this good.   Paired it with rice pilaf.

Delicious!  I loved the addition of oregano to my regular marsala recipe.  I looked this up because I'd forgotten the proportions to use and this was very good.  I only used marsala, no sherry, and I should have cooked it down more at the end but that was my fault.

Well....I must say, this recipe was very easy. The reason I gave 4 stars is I should of known better, but 4 T of olive oil along with 4 T butter was wayyyy to much for us. I had grease floating in my sauce, which that has never happen to me before on other Chicken Marsalas.  If I ever make this recipe again, I would cut back on the oil and butter. And, yes, I did use the seasoning and flour for the chicken. Anyway, otherwise, for me, I would go back to my other recipes on Chucken Marsala. I had to try this one because of the high reviews. I love Allrecipes and make many of their recipes, esp Chef John.

This was delicious but runny, I think I'll add some cornstarch next time to add a little thickness to the sauce. Also, I didn't have any cooking sherry but it was fine without. (Maybe even better with?)

I made this as written.  I thought I was going to love it, but that wasn’t the case at all.  It was too sweet.  Neither my daughter or I liked it at all.  I removed the remaining chicken and mushrooms  from the pan (with almost no sauce), put it back in a frying pan and added chicken broth to dilute the sweetness.  It became much better, but as written, we did not like it.

One thing extra I did was take the chicken out of the pan after it was done and with reserved liquids, I added flour and equal parts of cream, wine and chicken stock until a thinner gravy consistency was left, Boiled up some angle hair past and poured sauce all over. Big hit with the family!!

Delicious. A lot of nice flavor. My husband loved it too.  The only thing I did different was at the end I took the juice in the pan and made a gravy out of it.  Yummy on top of the chicken!

Need to cook chicken the chicken longer.  When I browned it and cooked for another 10 minutes,  the sauce almost totally evaporated and the chicken was undercooked.  I did cook on medium heat.

We enjoyed the chicken marsala.  Thank You!  first time trying any chicken marsala recipe...
I followed the recipe but felt like there was too much butter and olive oil, and not enough marsala and cooking sherry.
After covering the pan, it didn't seem to cook down enough in 10 minutes so I cooked it down to where it seemed to be a nice thicker sauce.  When we tasted it, it seemed like something was missing...I remember some sweetness in the chicken marsala that I "craved", so I took out some natural maple syrup and poured about a tablespoon on the plate next to the chicken.  After taking a piece of chicken/sauce/mushroom and dipping it in the maple syrup, all the flavors came together (at least for us) in the way we were looking for them to come together.

Everybody in my family enjoyed this recipe, only thing I did differently was I added a tad more Sherry and Marsala just to have a bit more sauce to drizzle over the chicken and rice I made with it!

This recipe is super easy. I made it exactly as the recipe called for, except more mushrooms.  There was a ton of gravy. (perfect for the white rice side dish) I doubled the recipe and was concerned it might not come out as good being double the oil for the chicken. The chicken was so moist. Amazing!! I will make this again for sure.

I don't know enough about wine. I had Pinot Noir on hand, not Marsala. I don't know if they are at all similar, but that was my substitute. I probably won't try making this again.

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe as is, and I wasn't impressed. So, this time I tweaked it... 

changed/added the following:
didn't season flour - just seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and lightly floured
1cup Marsala
1/4 cup cooking sherry
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan  

-- after sautéing the vegetables, I added those ingredients together to make the sauce. 

added prosciutto 
1 small vidalia onion
1tsp freshly chopped garlic
2 packages of mushrooms

side of asparagus

Best Chicken Marsala I've ever had! I can't even order the dish at restaurants anymore because I know it won't even compare to this recipe. Pounding the chicken with the meat tenderizer is the most important part.

Like suggested by others I used all Marsala rather than the Sherry.  I also removed the chicken when it was done and cooked the mushrooms (more mushrooms) and sauce separately.

This is an excellent recipe and is easy to make.  I diced up some sweet onions and added them at the same time as the mushrooms.  I also blended 1/4 cup of half and half to the sauce to make it a little creamier.

I added a little flour to sauce after everything was cooked to get a thicker gravy and I used 1 cup of marsala wine.

Definitely making this again. I split the recipe 50% (because it was just for me) but i am making this again this weekend for four people. I love chicken marsalad, specially with pasta. Although, I hate the whole house smells like vinegar after the cooking ugh... :)

Delicious! Followed this recipe to a T.  Including  others suggestions to coat the chicken in a plastic bag.  Turned out amazing.  Even my picky teenage boys loved it.  One said it's like the chicken melts in your mouth, and it really does.  They picked around the mushrooms but that just meant more for  me and my husband!  Will definitely make again.

This was my first time having / making Chicken Marsala and I absolutely loved it! The only change I made was I added heavy whipping cream to the sauce as others have suggested. This was super easy and very delicious!

Surprisingly easy & very good. Would have gave it 5 stars except I'm no a chicken marsala expert. Also I didn't have cooking sherry so used just marsala wine only. Very good.

Made this tonight and it was delicious !!! I did add garlic and Purely Cajun Seasoning to the chicken before dipping it into the flour. I also  doubled the sauce and added a tsp of chicken Better than bouillon and I thickened it up with a little cornstarch. It was restaurant quality. I will be making this again.

Simple and easy to make, tastes really good. Easy enough for week night, but really can work for a nice dinner too; just up your game with side dishes.

I added only a bit of poultry seasoning to the flour mix, and decreased the pepper.

My son is doing the cooking these days, so I am always on the lookout for simplified versions of my favorites. This is a great example. He flubbed a bit on flouring the chicken, but even so, it was quite good. If you like lots of sauce, you might want to double or triple the wine, broth and amplify the seasoning a bit. This has a nice glaze, but not copious amounts. Even our recent mushroom convert was impressed!

Amazingly delicious!! Very easy to make!! Only thing I would add to the directions is letting the sauce simmer and reduce after chicken is cooked for a thicker sauce. Or add in a little bit of heavy whipping cream, more flour or milk to help thicken.  The sauce will be very thin/watery if you don’t do one of those added steps.

Everything tasted really well until I added the Marsala wine. It didn’t specify in the recipe whether to use dry or sweet Marsala. I didn’t even know there  were 2 kinds. I used the dry one. I wish I’d tried the sweet one. I think it’d tasted better.

Made this last night and it came out great. As per the other reviewers suggestions, I used 3/4c of Marsala, and added 1/3c chicken stock, and 1/4c heavy cream. I think I would have liked the sauce to be a teeny tiny bit thicker. Overall it was great and I’ll be adding this to my regular meal roster.

Between the butter and the olive oil, there was a huge separation in the sauce.  The flavor was great, though, so the next time I make it, I'm trying it without the olive oil.

This was a great recipe and family dinner. I was concerned that maybe an extra spice was needed, but following the recipe the flavor was spot on. Definitely a keeper for future dinners or company.

I enjoyed this meal. The only negativity is it doesn’t look great when you reheat. It tastes fine and I don’t mind the left overs. But the ingredients of the sauce separate. Luckily I’m not super picky when it comes to leftovers

Pretty easy recipe, liked it alot, roomates loved it. Added chopped garlic to it. Next time, I think I'll use less oil. Overall, a very tasty dish. I'll definitely make it again.

I made this as is. So good! The Marsala wine/sherry combination adds a depth to the flavor. Stir frying the chicken in equal parts butter and oil provided perfect texture.

It was delicious!  I doubled the recipe.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour.  I removed the chicken and sautéed the mushrooms, a small onion and a teaspoon of chopped garlic then added the wine.  I only used Marsala because I didn’t have sherry.  Finally I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and thickened with cornstarch paste before returning the chicken to the skillet.  I will be making this again!

Easy to make, moist and delicious. I used vinho verde wine, more mushrooms and capers. I also used frozen minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Finished it off in the oven.

My husband and I really liked this and will make again.  I did use both cooking marsala  and sherry wines because I had them on hand.  It tasted great.  I did make sure to cook down the wines so as not to get that strong taste.  Added a small amount of half and half.  Love how easy and quick this is to make.

Delicious  kept it simple followed the recipe  didn’t Brown it and take it out I browned it and  I left it just like the directions say and it was perfect.  Only used 1 tablespoon of  flour and used olive oil instead of butter trying to cook healthier so I don’t use butter and try and stay away from flour.  I also added a creole seasoning . Will make this way from now on! the mixture of the 2 wines worked great I never used sherry before making Marsala.

Great recipe- I just found that the 4 tbsp of olive oil left it with an oily mouth feel.  Fixed that by doing 2 TBSP of olive oil and 6 TBSP of butter and it was perfect!

It was good, but not amazing or something that I'd crave. The sauce was the best part, but I think it will depend on the quality of sherry and marsala you use. I used more mushrooms, I don't think one cup was enough. The chicken was very moist!

This was a delicious, easy recipe! I Will make it again. I usually feed 8 for dinner, so I added more chicken. When the chicken is cooked, I move it to a pan with a rack in a 275* oven. It will hold for more than an hour. When I cooked garlic, added beef broth and marsala wine, I let it simmer , covered for 30 min. To thicken the gravy I used “ tapioca flour” mixed with water. Instead of a thick ( flour) gravy, the “ tapioca flour/ water mixture into bubbly liquid mixture. It thicken like a glaze. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly as written because it was my first time trying it.  It’s a great recipe for my first time making Chicken Marsala.  I’m sure if I make it again it will be modified.  My husband liked it a lot.  I’m glad because it’s one of his favorite dishes.

I've made this twice now, the first time was a roaring success. So delicious. The second time I had some timing issues and the breading on the chicken got a little too moist with the marsala. The flavors were still there and any issue with that meal was my fault alone.  We will be making this one again.

The only thing I changed was, I left out the garlic and added fresh thyme with the Marsala wine and used Dry Sherry instead of cooking Sherry.  It was great!

I made it twice, the first time I had no marsala wine or cooking sherry so I used Kendall Jackson Chardonnay in stead (and it was GREAT); second time I thought I'd not waste my yummy wine and, well, the recipe is not as good as the KJ plan... jus sayin

Excellent recipe.  I added more marsala and a few tablespoons of mascarpone cheese to thicken and add that velvety touch to send it over the moon.  Served with fettuccine  and green beans!  A feast for the family on a Tuesday night!

My new favorite! Changes: ***DAIRY FREE RECIPE***I used all butter (earths balance) instead of oil. I didn't like how it came out with oil the first time.  I Cooked the chicken with half the butter (4tbs) and set to the side. Added the other half of the butter (4tbs) and sauteed mushrooms. Then I added the wine. I used all marsala wine and doubled it. Added chicken back in, covered and simmered for 10 min. I removed chicken again, added 3/4 cup of coconut milk and added the  left over flour mixture from the chicken. Simmered until thick and served over angel hair with chicken. Full filled my craving and got me hooked!

Sauteed the chicken, removed from pan and set aside.  Added a little minced garlic, mushrooms, marsala wine and sherry and let it simmer- I did double the amount of ingredients for the sauce.  Added a little chicken broth and heavy cream, as well as a little cornstarch to thicken.  The sauce had a very strong wine taste, so I added a little more extra cream to it.  Added the chicken breasts back to the pan and let it all simmer for a few min.  Served on top of fresh linguine pasta, with a salad and some fresh crusty bread.  Delicious!

First time making it, but took a little longer than stated. Substituted dry vermouth for sherry. Very tasty, and the kids liked it too!

Omg this has to be the best recipe on this site.  I’ve been cooking for my husband for 12 years and when I made this, he said it was the best meal I’ve ever made.  I didn’t have sherry so I used 3/4 c Marsala.  And I thickened the sauce with corn starch.  Omg!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the sauce which still wasn't enough. Next time I'm tripling it. The flavor was so good and the chicken was very tender. Looking forward to making it again

This was very easy and delicious, however, I thought the sauce or chicken could have used a bit more flavor. I will add a few other herbs or maybe garlic next time.

With having nothing to compare it to I thought it was pretty good. I gave the mushrooms to my husband on his plate before I served it. The sauce was good. I followed the recipe except I used only 2 chicken breast and kept the liquid the same amount so we would have extra sauce. Will make again

Great. I cooked chicken first and set aside then sautéd mushrooms and added 2T flour to thicken before adding liquids.  I also added 1/2c chicken stock to sauce since the flavor was a little strong fir my family.

I liked it, pretty simple but tasty. Fast to prep which is a big plus.

I didn't bother to flatten the meat, and I used some chicken thighs instead of breasts. Worked out fine.

Quite good, but I prefer using my recipe that deviates slightly.  I don't coat the chicken with flour, but use an egg wash and Italian Panko crumbs.  Also use 1 cup of chicken broth, and use ½ c of that to thicken (with 2.5 T flour.)  DO NOT eliminate the sherry!  That ingredient boosts the flavor to real restaurant quality.

This was extremely quick and easy to make. I added garlic powder to the flour. I was going to put shallots in with the mushrooms but didn't have any. I might add a little more salt to the flour & the mushrooms next time but it still had a wonderful flavor.

I made this receipt as suggested and LIGHTLY COOKED  the chicken BEFORE  placing the mushrooms and other ingredients in the chicken pan to start making the sauce ASSUMING that the chicken would cook all the way. It did not turn out as planned and while the sauce cooked the chicken never cooked all the way and ruined the whole dish.  PLEASE COOK THE CHICKEN ALL THE WAY SEPARATELY BEFORE YOU BEGIN THE SAUCE PART.

I also added garlic and heavy cream to make the sauce creamy and that made a big difference.

I will definitely make this recipe again.  The only change I made was that I used white cooking wine instead of the marsala or the sherry (only because that's what I had on hand).  My husband and I both really liked it.  The directions are easy to follow and it turned out great.

Absolutely delicious! I would have given it five stars but I had to make some minor changes.  I dredged the chicken in the seasoned flour mixture and browned in olive oil and margarine.  Then I removed the chicken.  I then scraped all the brown bits from the pan and added lots of fresh garlic.  Sauteed for about a minute.  I then added the mushrooms and sauteed  a bit.  Added a full cup of marsala wine and a half cup of the sherry.  I let it reduce a bit then I took a little out and mixed some flour to make a paste.  Added that back to the mushroom sauce.  Added the chicken to the pan, and let it cook about 10 min till the sauce was thickened and chicken was cooked through.  Spooned sauce over the top of the chicken. Serving with some basmati rice.

Followed the recipe very closely.  I did add some garlic (about 1 tbsp minced) to the butter and oil.  I also used 3/4 cup of marsala and no sherry (since i didn't have any).  i also used almond flour for coating the chicken.  Instead of pounding the chicken, I cut boneless skinless breasts in half horizontally to create two thin pieces.  In preparing, I took the chicken out of the pan while cooking the mushrooms in the wine.  Then I poured the wine/mushrooms over the chicken and served over rice.

The sauce didn't turn out too well.  Not sure if I didn't simmer it enough but it tasted kind of sour.  We were able to taste the wine. I may try to make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time today. I did modify a little by adding garlic and onions. My family was totally satisfied and impressed with the results. Thank you allrecipes for his new addition to my menu choices.

After reading a few reviews, I doubled the mushrooms, used 3/4 cup of Marsala (omitted the sherry), and added 4 cloves of  fresh, minced garlic to the olive oil & butter in the beginning.  Perfect!

Like any chef I made some changes but overall a great recipe. I added a little more Marsala wine and dropped the Sherry. Give it the time to reduce good. Make sure to use fresh pasta, it makes a big difference if you don't. Also I like to put one artichoke heart half on each chicken breast. Chef Shep.

Most recipes on this site are creations of the cooks & chefs who enter them, most ... but not this recipe.  Chicken Marsala is a classic french recipe and if you are going to put things like eggs or capers, then you should give it another name and make it a new recipe!    Also, never use cooking wine to cook with ... if a wine isn't fit to drink then it isn't fit to cook with either, use a good broth instead.

Made per recipe except I followed the instructions on the video, so I removed the chicken from the pan, sautéed the mushrooms, then returned chicken to cook with the wine sauce. We found this very tasty and simple to prepare. I will definitely make this again and will use for guests as well.

This recipe was easy to do.  I did not have chicken breast so I used chicken thighs and did not flatten, will do next time with chicken breast and add more mushrooms next time since we love mushrooms.  All in all a good flavorful recipe and will do again.

Love it and have made it twice in a week because everyone loved it so much. 1 mod the second time was to add garlic. That's it! Super easy.

This was so good - so easy - so fast.  I used chicken tenderloins which are thinner and smaller to start with and then pounded them out.  Great meal.  Faszt and easy and tasty. Hard to beat.

Good recipe. Had to add more sauces and seasoning towards the end to stretch the sauce.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written with the exception of adding some garlic and onions and thickening the sauce with a little corn starch at the end. It was easy but it just didn't do it for us. Too sweet maybe; not sure.  Probably won't make it again.

I followed this recipe to a T and it was delicious! I doubled everything in the recipe, except the chicken, so I would have enough sauce for a box of linguine. I used a huge frying pan I keep in the garage so the ingredients would have room to cook in the pan and the pounded chicken wouldn't be needed to cook in several batches causing some of bits in the bottom to burn. I even doubled the coating on the chicken because I wanted to make sure with doubling the liquid it would thicken up enough. This was so easy and so good! I have tried several Marsala recipes that called for broth and I thought it was a key ingredient, however those recipes seem to lack a depth of flavor. I was concerned that the sherry would give it too much of a bite and it wouldn't be good, but it absolutely made the dish! I also bought Holland House Marsala and Sherryl because that's all the store had and I was worried that I didn't have better quality wine, but it was perfect! Try this recipe as is and you won't be disappointed. It is the only Marsala recipe I will ever use from here on out! Thanks for sharing. Enjoy!

This really was quite good!  Just be careful that you don't cook the chix for too long so it will stay moist.   I nearly didn't use both marsala and sherry...but since I had them both...I did!  Very nice gravy.  And a  nice drink to have as you are making it!

Family loved it! Did modify a little, sherry was expired (oops) so I added a couple tablespoons of chicken stock, and used 2/3c of Marsala.  Took chicken out, slightly sauted mushrooms with garlic before added the chicken and liquids. Husband said it was "restaurant quality."

This was so unbelievably good. My entire family gobbled it right up. I only wish I had doubled the sauce. Other than that I made it just as the recipe states and it was soooo good. My family said I could make it every week and they would never get tired of it. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe, I added some fresh garlic to the butter/oil, and put extra oregano and a bit of rosemary and added a touch of cayenne pepper. Really good instructions, chicken came out perfectly cooked and juicy. Served with pasta.

Made it for my family and everyone enjoyed it! Of course, I modified it s little bit. For instance, I added a little bit of Parmesan cheese to too my chicken. Delicious! Made it with a side of roasted red potatoes and broccoli.

Loved!! So simple. Made as directed, but I did thicken the sauce at the end with a few teaspoons of flour & omitted the oil (just forgot to add). Flattening your chicken is a must.

This was much easier than I expected and the flavor was amazing!  The only change I would make would be to use even more mushrooms next time.  I made mushroom risotto to go with this and would definitely recommend that, or something similar like farro which I think I will try next time!

This was delicious! As good as any I've had in a restaurant. I browned the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side and kept it warm in the oven while I made the sauce. Added a touch more butter to the pan then added garlic and mushrooms while scraping up the brown bits. I used 3/4 cup of marsala and a splash of whipping cream, and poured it over the chicken when done.  SO good!

I would not have loved this recipe so much if I had not followed some suggestions from previous reviews on here: I doubled the sauce, threw in crushed and sliced garlic with triple the mushrooms, and added some chicken broth and half and half in there. Served it over fettuccini with some reggiano. Delicious!

I added flour to the marsala sauce to thicken it up and added more wine to make a larger quantity because I served the chicken over egg noodles for a marsala pasta. I also didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used a red wine vinegar instead. It tasted great!

I browned the chicken in butter with garlic and onion, then removed the garlic and proceeded with recipe as described except that I did not have sherry cooking wine so I used chicken broth. I placed in the slow cook for 4 h on low. Perfect!

Yucko. In defense of the recipe I overcooked the chicken and used cheap marsala wine. I also thickened this with cornstarch/water slurry. This dish looked nothing like the picture and the flavor was subpar. I would not make this dish again.

I have made this a number of times and it is delicious. I generally reduce the sherry to a dash and substitute chicken broth because otherwise we find the alcohol taste too strong. I also add a little more liquid (3/4 cup Marsala and 1 full cup chicken broth) so we have extra to pour over spaghetti. I also add some garlic and onion powder to give it a little extra flavor. It is a crowd pleaser!

If you make this recipe as is, its delicious.  I have a slight gluten issue so I made it with Gluten free flour.   I used Shitake mushrooms, a little oil, butter and mixed the oregano with a little pepper and himalayan sea salt. 

Husband loved it and so did I.  I used some chicken cutlets  antibiotic free,  no need to pound them they were very soft. 

I would definitely make them again.

I made this for dinner. I am not good at mesuring things I just eye them. I did not have sherry or Marsela sauce. I cooked the chicken as instructed, I bought canned mushrooms. I drained the water in a container. . I cooked the mushrooms till brown. I added the water the mushrooms came in.  Added red wine, cornstarch and half and half to thicken then sauce. My hubby loves every bit of it.

I've made this a few times, but the last time I added 1/2 of a shallot, finely chopped, which I think brought it to the next level. I always use a gourmet mushroom trio of portobellos, cremini and oyster mushrooms. Make sure to let the sauce thicken slightly. I serve with garlic mashed potatoes, which I make by adding up to 4 garlic cloves with the boiling potatoes, milk, butter, salt and pepper to taste.

Amazing! I did follow some others advice and added cream and doubled the mushrooms.  By far my favorite to date! So easy!

My wife and I really liked this recipe. I changed it a little and took out the chicken after cooking and set aside. I ended up adding 5 cups of mushrooms instead of 1  cup to the Marsala  and used white cooking wine instead of the sherry. Thickened up the sauce with a little flour for consistency. Put the chicken back in to meld together for a couple minutes

I made it in the morning and then baked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 300 degrees and it turned out great!  All 4 loved it, served with egg noodles.  Should have made more sauce, as the flavour soaked in while waiting to go in the oven.

This will definitely be made again. I think it's the best recipe on here I've tried yet....and that's saying something! The only change I would make would be to add more mushrooms, but that's just out of personal preference (we LOVE mushrooms!).

I made this last night and it was fantastic. I used 3/4 cup of marsala instead of adding the sherry. Served it over a bed of linguine.  It was very easy to make and was absolutely delicious.

I used dry sherry instead of cooking sherry (cooking sherry and wine is full of sodium and other additives) and added a bit of garlic (shallot would taste good, too.)  I kept some chicken broth with a bit of marsala and sherry mixed in so that in case the cooking liquid boiled off too much, I could replace it. This came in handy the second time I made it. Keeping a bit of the seasoned flour is a good idea in case you want to make a thicker sauce at the end of the cooking time.

I love chicken Marsala and love the addition of sherry in the recipe. The only thing I change is not coating the chicken with flour. I always end up with a lumpy sauce. I cook my chicken seasoned w the salt pepper and herbs and use the pan dripping with a small Amount of extra butter or olive oil to make a roux. This just works better for me.  Silly smooth sauce.

I really enjoyed making this recipe.   I doubled the recipe because I had extra chicken breasts, and drained the sauce off after cooking the wine and mushrooms with the chicken.  Then in a small pot, I cooked the sauce with a can of chicken stock, some garlic, onion salt, a bit of sugar and some cornstarch to make a decent amount of gravy.  This way, the chicken was saturated with the Marsala flavor, and I had lots of extra sauce/gravy to put over the pasta I serve the chicken with.  It was really good and my family raved.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I like a stronger sweet Marsala flavor than this created.  Still really good though!

This is a really great base recipe.  I, as others have done, opted to add some things (more seasonings in the flour, and thinly sliced onion in the pan), and shook the chicken in a bag to avoid the mess.  I also used Pinot Noir instead of Marsala wine.  I like the flavor, and it seems to pop more.  Don't be afraid to let this simmer longer than 10 minutes.  Wait for the right consistency of the mushrooms and sauce; then, it's ready.

I make this atleast once a month.  The only change I have is that I double the butter, olive oil, sherry and wine.  It makes more gravy to top mashed potatoes :)

This was totally the bomb!!!  I followed the example of some other reviewers and added onions with the mushrooms after taking the chicken out and setting it aside, then a couple of sliced garlic cloves before deglazing the pan with all Marsala wine.  I let it reduce and then added some chicken stock and the chicken back in.  I simmered it for 10 minutes and served with spinach spaghetti.  So delicious the sauce was silky and so smooth. My husband loved it, as did I!  Will definitely be making this again for sure!

Not as overpowering in flavor as other marsala chicken I've had. Recipe asked for way too much butter & oil so I cut those in half. And I love mushrooms so I tripled those. Great tasting dish and I love that it wasn't overpowering.

So what is the big deal between the "cooking" marsala and real marsala wine?  The rule is "if you won't drink it, don't cook with it".  So I bought both.  And man, I can tell you, buy the real wine!  The cooking marsala was salty and had no body.  Like others suggested, I used only marsala, no sherry.  I added onions and garlic.   Triple the sauce!  I served with broccoli and fettuccini noodles.  Next time I will make with French green beans as I feel the broccoli was too over powering.  The focus of this plate should be the marsala!

Honestly not that good of a recipe. My mom makes a wonderful chicken marsala but I didn't know how and instead of asking her beforehand I thought to try an online recipe... Mistake One. The chicken turned out with a soggy breading because of the wine and didn't actually absorb any flavor. Apparently breading or four-ing the chicken isn't a popular opinion, so Mistake Two. It ended up tasting like a normal chicken with soggy wine flour pieces. Afterwards, I asked my mother how she usually makes it and apparently it's almost backwards from this recipe.
First, she pours the wine into the skillet and heats it up a bit, then adds the mushrooms to it. Once that's cooked a bit she adds the chicken pieces, which she has not breaded or floured (with good reason), and lets that cook until ready.
By the end, the chicken has actually absorbed a lot of the wine and is perfect to serve over a nice pile of rice or pasta.
So Third and Final Mistake was not actually asking how she made it before trying it myself and expecting similar results.
Rating: Would not follow THIS recipe again but chicken marsala is just too good to not try and make again, properly this time.

My family LOVED this recipe. The only change I made was: I added a half cup of chicken stock (in addition to the rest of the ingredients). I also generously covered the chicken with flour to help thicken the sauce.

I give this 5 stars for the method this is prepared and cooked, at the last minute i realized i did not  have Marsala wine but really wanted to try this recipe. I did everything exact until it came time to add the Marsala and mushrooms, instead i added "Mushrooms in White Wine Sauce" by LINDALL on this site, it was close and a great substitute when you are in a bind like i was. The meat was so tender do not skip the pounding it is worth it, i dont have a meat mallet so i laid wax paper over the chicken and used the long side of a can of soup to pound. The combo of the oil and butter made a great base for the sauce and made it restaurant quality. I pulled half the butter out of the pan before it melted realizing that it would be way to much, i also used unsalted butter. Thank you for the great recipe, cant wait to try it with the correct wine! Try this with the slow cooker mashed potatoes from this site.

This recipe is super easy to follow. I had most ingredients except the Sherry in my cupboard. I googled a substitute for Sherry  and used that instead.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this with just two large chicken breast. They just fit in a very large skillet after pounding them flat. Also I wanted to have extra sauce to use over small spinach and cheese raviolis. I doubled the mushroom, used all marsala (3/4 cup) no sherry and added just a little heavy cream to the sauce (good suggestion). I cooked the chicken and removed while I cooked down the mushrooms and made the sauce. I then added the chicken back in for a few minutes. The only thing I would change next time is to season the sauce with salt and pepper. It really needed it.

A  very good dish, quick and easy recipe. I also used all Marsala because I had no sherry but it was still excellent. I'll make this one again.

I made this for the first time last night and my husband and I both gave it a two thumbs up.  I followed the directions exactly, except I did thicken the sauce at the advice of other reviewers.  I did cheat and used thinly sliced chicken breasts because I hate pounding chicken.  This was absolutely delicious and I plan to make it when I have company next week.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The flavor was nice but when all was said and done this dish didn't yield any extra sauce–at all.  I followed the recipe as written and ended up with some decent tasting chicken on a bed of very bland egg noodles.  I just don't think this is the marsala recipe for me.

This truly is easy and delicious. I served it over noodles. I followed this recipe, something I rarely do; but that was a good idea in this case. It was a good enough substitute for veal, the classic.

I followed the recipe exact and I found the sauce too salty like, so I added some cream to tame it and thickin the sauce and it was much better in my opinion.   I'll make it again.

Very flavorful chicken in this easy to make Marsala dish. I used fresh chicken tenders instead of the breasts, so the meat was nice and tender. I recommend making on a night where you might not have a ton of time to spend in the kitchen but want a tasty and healthy meal. 

The only step I would omit the next time I make this dish, and I will, is flouring the chicken. Once I added the wet ingredients and let the entire dish simmer, the flour coating turned a bit soggy - not a fun texture for the palate. 

P.S. I added a small, sliced white onion and served with a side of creamed spinach.

Awesome! Followed instructions almost exactly but used chicken tenders as thats what I had. Also used one big pkg of Bella mushrooms and since I didnt have any sherry on hand I subbed out Chardonnay for it. That admittedly made it a bit sweet so I cut the sweetness back by adding about a 1/4C 2% milk. I also added about 2 tsp chopped garlic. Served over white rice and the kids gobbled it up. They actually enjoyed eating chicken! Amazing :)

Once of the best chicken marsala recipes that I've found.  The only thing I added was a splash of heavy cream.  This over a bed of pasta makes a great meal.

This turned out great! I was really worried about it about halfway through because I realized I forgot to pound the chicken. I thought the chicken might be dry since I didn't do that, but that was not the case. It was super moist and really really good. The only change I made was the simmer time. I thought it needed a little more than ten minutes. I have a knack for screwing up recipes, but not this one. It was really easy and there were no leftovers!

This recipe is very good although the first time I made it the sauce was too thin and there wasn't enough. I followed some tips from previous comments. I threw 3-4 cloves of garlic halved in the butter and oil and removed once brown. Then browned the chicken. After browning the chicken I removed the chicken from the pan set aside.  I then doubled the sauce(Marsala wine and sherry) and added a little more butter(2Tbsp). Then added the mushrooms, some heavy cream and some cornstarch to the sauce. Cooked for about 10 mins and added the chicken back in about 5 mins through to reheat. My family is absolutely loved this dish.

We are a Native American/Hungarian family I used the listed ingredients but added 2 tablespoons of  minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of Emeril Essence  and 1/2 tsp Marjoram I omitted cooking Sherry and used 1/2 cup Marsala wine. I flattened the chicken breast. It was very tender.  I poured it over cooked Amish wide noodles with alfredo sauce. My guys loved it

This was my first time making  Chicken Marsala ever and so for that reason I followed the recipe to a "T". 

First of all, I  found the photo misleading, and could have been because of the brand of sherry or Marsala cooking wines. 

I was disappointed that the sauce was thin and not thickened up at all. I was told that it was because of the flour not being made separately, using the cooking wines, as many Marsala recipes do.

My guests and I really liked the flavor. In the future  I'll be trying another recipe or modifying this to make the sauce thicker.

I made the recipe as written, and I thought it had great flavor.  I have never had chicken marsala before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  My kids all ate it too.  I served it over linguini.  In retrospect, I should have made more sauce because it almost completely evaporated on me because I had my stove a little too hot.  Next time, I will triple the sauce if I am serving with pasta.  Double it if serving on its own.

Very good recipe. I did add a little garlic and herbs de Provence   Omitted the sherry, I've tried it both ways and don't feel like it makes a huge difference. Also added a small amount of half and half at the end. Doubled the sauce and mushrooms.

Added onion. Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. The chicken breast was extremely juicy and flavorful. The best chicken breast recipe I've ever tried (a lot better than the baked chicken teriyaki and chicken tikka masala in this site). Will make it again and again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!!

want to make this super easy? use your slow cooker! I tripled the recipe, browned chicken in a pan then put it in the slow cooker on high for 2 hours low for one with the wine and sherry. Had plenty for a large family and leftovers. We are also a gluten free home so I used gluten free flour and put it over gluten free pasta. It was a hit!

This recipe was OK, but I also modified it.  After I cooked the chicken I removed it from the pan and added the mushrooms and onions the the pan.  When the onions started to look transluscent, I put the chicken back in the pot and increased the marsala wine ro 3/4 cups and added a 1/4 cup of cooking wine.  I added twice the mushrooms and served with a spinach salad.

This is a wonderful recipe. I half the butter, and add 4xs the mushrooms. My family never thinks there are enough mushrooms. I didn't have sherry, this time, so I replaced it with brandied Apple cider. I prefer it to the sherry. Delicious!!

Good recipe that was easy and quick to make, and that's a 5-star in my book. Husband kept remarking how delicious it was. I followed it to a "t" except for taking the advice of the reviewer who added a bit of heavy cream after browning the chicken. I had half-n-half on hand so I used that instead, and used maybe 2T or so. I couldn't find marsala so I subbed with a pinot noir.  Served with al dente fettuccine and steamed vegetables. Will make this again.

This is an excellent recipe. No one in my family except for myself likes mushrooms so I excluded the mushrooms and added some tarragon to offset the balance of earthy to aromatic flavors the mushrooms provide. It may no longer be chicken marsala but it's a great way to prepare chicken! ;)

This is a fast easy recipe with great flavor and wonderful taste.  I added pasta and cooked broccoli to the pan covered  them with the sauce and served in a big bowl.  It was well received and  finished in no time.

Great foundation recipe.  I like the addition of sherry.  But I doubled the sherry & marsala, added garlic, and paste chicken bullion.  Reduced it by half or so.  Then browned the sesoned chicken, removed it and added more butter to brown the mushrooms.  Added everything back to the skillet and thinned the sauce with more marsala. Added a little more salt & pepper.  It was amazing over mashed potatoes!

So this was my first try making this.  I took into consideration what others said.  I pretty much cooked it like the recipe. What I changed was; more seasoning in the flour mixture and I added more seasonings to the sauce. I.e. garlic,  pepper,  onion powder, fresh garlic and Italian seasoning.  Not bad for my first try.  Since I was not using the sauce as a gravy, I simmered the sauce longer to allow it to reduce.

Added more mushrooms and wine...we like it smothered :)   Careful not to overcook and to save time, buy your chicken breast trimmed and thin.   I serve this with broccoli and Italian dressing and baked potatoes     This meal truly is a 30 minute meal!

I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was fantastic! I've never been one to order this at a restaurant, but I've had friends who were obsessed with this dish. Now that I have this recipe I will never order this out, it's so easy and tasty! My whole family, including my picky toddler ate this up. I served it alongside angel hair pasta and zucchini.
I think it really helped to use both the masala wine and sherry. I also use real butter and extra virgin olive oil. Fake butter /margarine has an odd taste to me.
One shortcut I used was to out the flour mixture in a zip lock bag and put the chicken in the bag, shake it up, and voila, totally dredged with easy cleanup. I always do my dredging this way.

Made this last night and family loved it!  I used a couple different mushrooms.  I left out the sherry and instead added a cup of chicken broth and cooked it on low for an hour. I am glad I doubled the recipe so we can have it again.

This was SO amazing! I had never had Chicken Marsala before making this, but WOW! It's easy to make too, which made this recipe all the better. Definitely a keeper! I have some leftovers in the fridge and yet, I still can't wait to make it again! Changes I made: Omit sherry and increase marsala to 3/4 cup.

I halved the butter and olive oil. I also added a cup of chicken broth in with the wine. I used a slurry of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I made it with 1 & 1/3rd's pound of chicken tenders because that was what I had, and they worked fine. I hit it with a 1/2 tablespoon of butter and an extra splash of sweet sherry almost at the end.  This is my go to recipe now.

This recipe is great as is. Very quick and super easy. I will use a dash more salt next time but that's just my taste. Served over linguini with green beans. Great meal.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe. I did make some modifications. Yes, I have unusual tastes, but adding figs really made this recipe pop for me!  I added about 10 chopped up dried figs. Will use fresh figs next time but I happened to have a can on hand.  I used cornstarch with just a little flour for the breading to make it nice and light and crispy. Also added a whole quart of fresh sliced portobello mushrooms, doubled the Marsala wine and sherry and added about a tablespoon of minced jarred garlic.  Enjoy!

I've made this recipe several times and it's one of my favorites. I do however, add about twice the mushrooms  (prefer the portabello) I also add garlic powder to the flour mixture. It's such a fast and easy dinner to make that it's a regular in our home.

I gave it 5 stars because it's a good base recipe. I Does need some garlic and onion added and after reading the reviews, that's just what I did.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and finely diced 1/2 of a small/ medium onion. After pounding them flat, I covered my chicken breasts well in the flour mixture (I used my Gluten Free baking mix) before putting them in a hot pan with a couple tbsp. Grapeseed oil (grapeseed oil is better at high heat than EVOO, I typically use my cold pressed EVOO for salad dressings and some baking).  A few minutes after turning my chicken over I added 1 & 1/4 cups of  what I had which was Dry Marsala Wine. Sweet Marsala Wine was recomended to me by a chef so I improvised with 1 tsp. organic sugar (since this dish at the local itallian chain is Slightly sweet). I added the mushrooms, garlic and onions on top and put the lid on for everything to finish cooking.  The chicken breasts were done in 5 minutes with the lid on so, I plated them up and put my mashed potatoes beside them. I let the sauce cook another 5-10 minutes. I Did ad a couple more tbsp butter, since I added more Marsala to the recipe, and a splash of the whipping cream. It looked thick enough but, I made a cornstarch slurry w/1 tbsp cornstarch and 1/4 c water, stirred it well and added it which, instantly thickened it some more. I spooned the sauce over my chicken (which was nicely browned) and mashed potatoes!  I would try it wo/ the cornstarch next time as, I don't think it needed it. This

I removed the chicken and whisked in a little extra flour at the end/let it cook a few minutes to thicken the sauce. Next time, I'll halve the oil & butter and double the mushrooms. I may add some garlic as well.

GOURMET RESTAURANT GOOD.   This is a stellar recipe.  I wouldn't even try to improve it.  My one strong recommendation:   Continue cooking the sauce after removing the chicken until it reduces and thickens. You will have perfection.  The family's verdict:  Must return to table soon.

I made this recipe and it was quite good. If you're making a lot (16 servings for the family) be sure and use 2 pans and put only half a cup of butter in each pan. You also don't need much olive oil. I added some curry, parsley, more pepper and a bit of cayenne pepper to the mix and just put the chicken in a zip lock bag and shook the bag to coat it. Muuuuch easier. I also added a whole onion as well as strips of a yellow and red pepper. This not only improved he color but the taste too. It was absolutely delicious. Add the onion and bell pepper when you add the mushrooms and let it simmer. Remember I used one white onion, as well as one yellow and one red pepper to make 16 servings so plan accordingly with that. Enjoy! (I served this with curry rice and it went with it spectacularly)

It was okay following the recipe, kind of bland. I put more oregano in, added sea salt, pepper, garlic, and a kick of Abodo for flavor. Also added heavy whipping cream. I used portobello mushrooms. It tastes like how Chicken Marsala is suppose to taste.

I wasn't expecting much but this was amazing! I changed/added two minor things. I added a few random spices, shook the chicken/flour mixture in a bag, and added 1 cup of heavy shipping cream with a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Can't wait to make this again!

I didn't have the Sherry cooking wine, so I substituted half a bouillon cube dissolved in 1/4 cup water.  It was so beautiful and delicious that my 14 year old felt the need to judge it Chopped style.  I wonder if I made it to the dessert round.

Made this for Sunday dinner and it was a hit! Even my son, the pickiest eater loved it! My husband inhaled the meal and said it was delicious! I added, roasted red potatoes and roasted, Brussels sprouts drizzled in cranberries and olive oil for the sides. For the recipe, I doubled the cremini mushrooms, cream sherry and Marsala. I also, added fresh Italian parsley and it was a hit!!!!!! Will make again!!!

I double the mushrooms, and add 2-3 crushed cloves of fresh garlic.  Also use 3/4 cup Marsala wine, and 1/4 cup Sherry, or just 1 full cup Marsala if you have no Sherry.  Don't buy the cheap grocery store wine, though.  Get a good Marsala and Sherry from the liquor store.  That will make all the difference!

I have made this recipe many times with a few changes and loved it.  I buy the thin sliced chicken breasts.  I omit the salt since I never use salt anymore.  I only use half the butter and oil.  I also skip the mushrooms since I don't like them.

Very good recipe, thanks for sharing!  The only thing I did differently was, that I browned the chicken on both sides first, before adding the mushrooms. I just think the directions weren't clear on that. 
Served over pasta, very tasty; will definitely make again!

Came out perfect - even when I substituted the marsala and sherry with a sweet cabernet sauv. It didn't quite sauce up as much as I would have hoped, but it was simple and flavorful, so I am not complaining too much. :)

I make this dish all the time! It is one of my husband's favorites. It is so quick and easy, and yet so delicious! Much better than ordering Marsala chicken at a restaurant. Great recipe!

A great base recipe, strikingly similar to one offered by a large chain restaurant.   The chain uses dry Marsala in their dish (as opposed to sweet), which makes a world of difference in the flavor outcome.

I was pleasantly surprised and the flavor was amazing.  I was a bit scared the color was not the deep brown sauce shown in the photo, that did confuse me.  Because the sauce was supposed to be brown I prepared it with steamed rice, if I had known it would have taken on the lighter color and texture I would have made mashed potatoes.

This is an excellent and easy marsala recipe.  Use a good sherry - not the salty grocery store stuff - and you will not regret it.  Like some of the other cooks, I added some garlic when adding the mushrooms.  After removing the meat from the skillet, I made a water/cornstarch slurry, added a splash of half-and-half, and served this over the chicken.  Yummy.

This recipe is great my family loves it. I  have been making this very simple dish for a few years now. Its easy enough for anyone with very basic cooking skills to make with great results if you actually use the ingredients it calls for and follow some of the very simple directions. My very picky children love it.

This was my first time making chicken marsala!!! I've always had it at Olive Garden never home made. The only thing I changed was using all Marsala wine instead of the cooking sherry. Also I used French onion soup after sautéing the mushrooms and garlic to kinda deglaze the brown bits then added the wine. I only used the soup b/c I was feeling lazy and didn't want to cut up any onions. The soup kinda thickened the sauce so I only added a pinch of flour. But it was very good and I can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow.

3 1/2 stars. This is pretty good, but could be better by being more flavorful. I served this with angel hair pasta.

Tasted great, but the chicken came out a little slimy. I suspect I didn't fry up the coated chicken long enough, so the flour mixture went goopy.

I did not make any changes and might make it again.  It had a nice flavor and was easy.  I could have spent more time with this recipe to personalize for our pallet but I needed something quick and easy for dinner last night and this worked.  Husband liked it too.  Thank you!

I loved this.  I used a large cast iron skillet to make this. I cut the chicken into strips and then put in the flour. Then I cooked all the chicken first. Removed to bowl then sauted the mushrooms and sliced onions, when they were done I put them in the same bowl as the chicken. Then I added 2 cups of Marsala wine and reduced it down (too much) so I added 1 cup of half & half.  Stirred quickly to make the sauce and then added in the chicken, mushrooms, onions. Yummy and super easy!

This was a great recipe! There are a few adjustments I made to it. First, instead of putting the mix in a dish or shallow bowl, I put it in a bag. Makes for less cleanup that way. I doubled the butter. I removed the chicken after browning it so that the mushrooms, which I doubled, could be sauteed in the butter. I doubled the wine and sherry and added a splash of heavy whipping cream. Added the chicken back in and then simmered.

I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so I didn't put any on my plate to taste, but DH loves them and happily ate all of mine. The chicken has a good flavor and the recipe is simple. The recipe I usually make doesn't include cooking Sherry so this was a nice change.

I tried this recipe and it turned out amazing and smells so good! Only additions I did was remove chicken after browning and sautéed mushrooms in the oil and butter with garlic and onions. The lightly floured chicken breasts thickened the sauce nicely. I added mashed red skin potatoes and sautéed green beans! Perfection!!!!

Excellent! My husband absolutely LOVED this meal. I doubled the amount of mushrooms, and doubled the sauce. There's just two of us, so we had lots of leftovers, which my husband rarely eats. He ate them...twice! I'll be making this on a regular basis!

Very easy to make! I didn't have wine so used both balsamic and apple vinegar then added some apple/berry juice mixed with some water to take the 'tang' out of the vinegar taste. Very good - husband and son loved it! I also put it in the oven at 350 for 30 mins then blasted it at 425 for another 10 mins. YUM! Served with green and yellow summer squash and buttered noodles.

Great! It was a tiny bit soupy, so I took the lid off and boiled it on high for a couple minutes after simmering. I also added dinner croutons on top, super delicious. The only real change I would make would be to use less oil, it came out a bit... oily. Seriously though, really good!

FANTASTIC!!!  Most likely the first recipe that I cooked just like the recipe said.   If I was going to make it and serve it with rice or noodles I would double the sauce.   Simple and delicious!!

I am not an experienced cook but I was very happy the way this turned out.  I had to double the sauce for sure and still it was not enough but the chicken was so good.  I used real marsala wine but cooking sherry and still I could not stop eating it.  I also added a little flour and milk to thicken slightly and pour over chicken.  Will be making it again.

Just made this for the second time in as many weeks and my family loved it!  my 7 year old son has always sworn he hates mushrooms but has 2 servings and says this is his favorite dish now :)  used extra mushrooms and a touch extra wine and sherry - amazing - thank you for a great recipe!

Solid recipe.  I only used Marsala Wine and not Sherry.  Will try again with both.

I tried this recipe. The changes that I made was I put a whole small container of mushrooms in. The dish turned out really well. Some of the complications I had was that the butter and the oil 'spit' everywhere when I added the chicken in.

I read the reviews and used a tip from one of them.  I added cream and the end and used corn starch to thicken it. Very good!

This recipe will become a staple in our home! Delicious and easy to make! I added more mushrooms because we love them, and used gluten - free flour, but all else I followed. So good!

i loved it, my daughter doesn't like mushrooms so the taste was too mushroomy for her, my oldest son said he liked it but that is debatable, my husband isn't keen on chicken in general & my youngest son wouldn't touch it....guess this isn't a recipe for my family unless i'm eating alone....but i did use the bag idea for coating, and the heavy cream and like i said i loved it.

Delicious! I did bake it in the oven with the chicken instead of frying it & also added heavy cream + corn starch to thicken. Served it over whole wheat gnocci! Yummy!

It was good, but bland. I altered the recipe slightly by adding onions in with the mushrooms. I also removed the chicken from the pan and put it in the oven to keep warm while I sauteed the onions and mushrooms. I added minced garlic, and put the chicken breasts back in the pan to finish cooking for 10 minutes. The chicken was perfectly cooked, but the reduction sauce was missing something.

this was an amazing meal.  I aadded cooking wines instead of alcohol and it was still delicious.  I served it over rice and it was incredibly moist and flavorful.  I added just a few extra mushrooms because i love them.  Such an easy meal!

It was very good. I made this as a freezer meal and cooked it in the crockpot. I didn't change anything but that. It cooked on low 8hrs from frozen. I served it over mashed potatoes and everyone really enjoyed it.

This is the best Chicken Marsala recipe we've ever tried, including at restaurants.  I usually double the sauce, just because it is so tasty.  Have never added cream or flour to make it more like a gravy, because it is so good as is, and who really need the extra calories.  My daughter's says this is one of her favorite meals.

Not sure if it was the marsala wine or the sherry wine..maybe the 1/4 teaspoon of salt, but this was ok. It landed on the bland side. I think when you're picking out the wine, get a one...

..and note the chicken pounding, I missed that note.and use chicken breast..I i used chicken w/rib meat and meh..

I like the basics of this recipe..I can definitely build something off it

This recipe is so easy and so yummy and I follow the recipe exactly.  I buy the thin sliced chicken breast so I don't need to pound them out and they work out perfect.  Kids DO NOT like mushrooms, so I remove them (after I cook it) and put them in separate bowl for serving and they don't even think about it.  They love the chicken. We serve this meal with some Jasmine rice and a green veggie :-)

Great just as is.  Next time we will add more mushrooms and wine, with shallots again.  Maybe could use more salt in the flour, and again before serving.  Delicious!

Self and boyfriend approved. Great with a rice medley or red or brown rice. We did make a couple changes: butterflied the chicken instead of tenderizing/pounding, used Cabernet instead of Masala wine, and used more mushrooms than suggested (baby bellas). That said, it came out great. Simple and flexible recipe, great for a weeknight!

This recipe was very good, I followed Ashley Jones additions I just used heavy cream and added a little honey. I also added bow tie pasta to the sauce which was a good texture change to the dish. It was easy to make and the taste seemed like you spent all day making it.

Top notch recipe.  I used chicken tenderloins, no pounding.  I used 3/4 cup Marsala, no sherry, and a little chicken broth to let the chicken soak up the sauce. Simmered 10 minutes more than called for.  Mashed potatoes and side salad.  Thanks for sharing this. This is a keeper!

This was good but not to-die-for fabulous. Our Sprouts market sells chicken cut thinly for scallopini so I used that and did not flatten the meat. I didn't have Marsala wine so I used Marsala cooking wine instead and added the cooking sherry. Because the cooking wines seem salty to me, I didn't add salt to the flour mixture. I'm glad I didn't--I think the dish would've been too salty otherwise. I used less olive oil and less butter because we want to avoid extra calories and the amt. I used (probably half of what was called for)was adequate. Awhile back I came across a screaming deal on sliced fresh mushroom--a huge bag for hardly any money. I divided them into several bags and froze them. For many recipes they've worked fine but in this case they seemed rubbery and that detracted from my enjoyment of the dish. The hubs didn't seem to notice and voiced no complaints--in fact, complimented the dish. I served it with rice because hubs requested it and there was quite a lot of sauce.

Great recipe. I followed what others said and put the flour and seasoning in a zip lock bag. I cut the chicken into medallions so they'd cook faster. Since I love mushrooms, I doubled them, and added some onions and garlic at the same time. I also thickened the sauce in the end after taking out the chicken pieces with a cornstarch slurry and a splash of half and half, because it's nice to indulge every now and then. Oh, and if you don't have sherry, use dry vermouth as a sub. 5 stars for the recipe poster and those leaving comments.

Very good but you do not need to coat the chicken just skip that part to save calories and it's just as good.  Do not use cooking Sherry either (yuck) use real Sherry or more Marsala wine.

This was OK, but the sauce was too thin and had to be modified.

Awesome!  Easy to make, which is a huge plus for me.  I couldn't get the sauce as thick as the video shows, but other than that, it was fantastic!

Quick and easy! Great for a week night dinner or for a fast, simple way to impress guests for a dinner party! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed zucchini and squash. Next time I'm going to try gnocchi.

This was terrific! Doubled the Marsala wine, added onions and sliced garlic and a couple dashes of tobasco for a little kick to sway the sweetness just a tiny bit. 
Served over egg noodles just fantastic and easy to make will make again. Be sure to use good quality wines I did per other reviewers suggestions it makes all the difference

I really liked the flavor of this recipe, and how uncomplicated and precise the flavor profile was. I can't imagine putting cream or cornstarch in this, as others have suggested. That just seems like a sludgy mess to me. However, I do have two thoughts. First, I forgot to put the oil in, and I don't believe anyone missed it at all. Halving the fats was in my mind the mistake I made that made this dish for me. Also, I agree with others who said that more mushrooms would be better. Let's get the fungus among us.

Great recipe and easy to make. Everyone in the family loves it even the kids. Only thing I do different is double the Marsala & sherry for the sauce so we can drizzle it on whatever side we make with it like mash potatoes or spaghetti.  At times I also use fresh oregano because I just have so much in my garden.

After reading all rave reviews, I was so looking forward to this dish. I liked the chicken itself but not the sauce. I actually couldn't stand the sauce at all. I've had chicken Marsala only one time and I don't think I was too fond of it and I guess this just proves that I just don't like chicken Marsala. I'm not a drinker so the strong alcoholic flavor made it worse. I followed the recommendations(cream, chicken broth) which should have diluted the alcoholic flavor but not quite enough. I liked the chicken itself a lot so I would have to find a different type of sauce for the chicken.

This is the only chicken marsala recipe I've tried, but it's easy to fix, has great flavor and I fix it for my family several times a month.  This is one of our "keepers".

Super easy to cook. Short prep time, short cook time, perfect for those of us who get home late but still like to cook. This was a very good dish, probably some of the best chicken I've ever eaten!

Wow, loved this very tasty chicken Marsala . I didn't have sherry on hand, just put more marsala. This will be a staple at our house. My family loved it, even my husband that doesn't really care for chicken. Easy and fast too! I will make sure there is more "gravy" next time.

This is very good even without the sherry.  Quick easy, and the best Marsala dish that I have ever made.  I've tried making Chicken Marsala a few times before using this recipe with some poor results, but this was nice.  I made sure to remove the chicken from the pan after the fry on both sides.  I then threw in about 3 cups of mushrooms (could have been more)and sauteed them for in the butter and oil a minute before adding the Marsala.  I also added the remaining flour mixture to the Marsala mushroom mixture before replacing the chicken in the pot for the final simmer.  Nice dish.

I'm not normally a fan of Chicken Marsala, but this was really good. Stuck pretty close to the original recipe and served over buttered egg noodles. I wish it would have made more sauce - I think next time I'll double the fats and liquids so that I have enough sauce to cover the noodles too. Very good recipe!

Super yummy and VERY easy to make, this dish looks elegant as well and is great for formal dinner parties. Made very minor changes, used thin cut chicken cutlets which did not need to be pounded down thinly. Seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt and pepper, then floured the chicken. Only used 2tbsp of butter and olive oil, and bought good marsala wine from the state store. I did not use the sherry just added more marsala wine. I doubled the fresh mushrooms and added onion and fresh garlic. This is a keeper my husband and I loved it. You will not be dissapointed.

Made very few changes to the recipes (increased mushroom and sauce; used regular Marsala wine instead of Marsala cooking wine), but both my husband and I felt it was fairly lacking in flavor.

Recipe was great!  I made a few easy changes. I pounded the chicken thin and then breaded it (dipped it in flour, then egg wash, then bread crumbs). I also used about 1/4 cup more Marsala wine & a little more butter; just to have extra sauce. I served it over tagliatelle and my husband LOVED it. I will definitely make this again. It was quick & easy.

The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is, I'm sure, because I did not buy high-quality Marsala wine.  Here is what I did:
Flattened the chicken breasts on the cutting board underneath plastic wrap.  I put the flour mixture in a jumbo Ziplock bag and alternated adding chicken pieces and a little flour.  When all the pieces were done, I sealed the bag and shook it up.  I then browned the chicken and set it off to the side on a plate.  I added probably 1 1/2 cups wine to the pan, along with the mushrooms.  I let it reduce for a minute or two, then added the chicken back in.  I turned the chicken once, simmering for probably 15 minutes while I made risotto.  I turned the heat down to low and added a few tablespoons of half and half and mixed it in.  The chicken was wonderfully browned and so tender I cut it with a fork.

Really great! I did use  marsala wine and chicken stock and no sherry because I do not care for sherry. I also added a little garlic, just personal preference.

My niece and I made this recipe and it was absolutely delicious.
The kids loved it and even had seconds. I think the sauce was a little to thin but it was wonderful anyway.

Be careful. Tripled sauce like one reviewer recommended and it turned out horribly. Be careful to taste the sauce before adding. My cooking sherry overpowered the dish. Very sour and vinegary.

Easy to follow instructions! Thank you so much for sharing! I followed the advice of ASHLEYJJONES and made a cream sauce to serve on the chicken. It was delicious! Honestly, I didn't have any heavy cream, so I put in some whipped cream! Our sons love it too! We put the sauce on roasted potatoes as well. I didn't have time or means to pound the chicken thinner, so I left the chicken breasts the way they were, but I cooked them through to start. What a delicious dish! A definite keeper!!

This was a hit at the party and super easy to prepare. I skipped the flour because I was cooking for some gluten-free friends and thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end. Delicious!

This chicken marsala is so amazing.  I made it for New Year's Eve and it was a big hit with everyone!  I made a few small changes to the original recipe.  Tripled the mushrooms, used less olive oil and less oregano.  Browned the chicken and then removed to a baking dish.  Made the "gravy" in the pan.  Made extra gravy to serve with my mashed potatoes and added a bit of half-and-half to smooth it out.  After cooking for about 10 minutes in pan, poured it over the chicken and popped it into the oven for about 30 minutes.  Turned out perfect!  Happy New Year!

This is a very easy and yummy recipe. I've made it many times.  if you don't want to pound chicken, simply cut it into thin cutlets. I also like adding green onions with mushrooms. It adds a nice flavor to the sause.

I made this for my husband and I tonight. We both generally like Chicken Marsala but I'm a pretty picky eater so I was skeptical but this recipe was very to cook, didn't take long and was amazing. The sauce was a bit thin as I think I didn't get enough flour on the Chicken but not to the point of being a downfall. The chicken was flavorful and tender. Definitely would recommend.
I would say though that it is worth it to track down a Marsala that isn't a cooking wine.

I make this Marsala Recipe in a French oven. It comes out perfectly every time! One thing that I found was when cooking with a French oven as you simmer it covered it really keeps all the moisture in, so I have to remember to pull the lid off about halfway through the simmering time. Other than that and a splash of half-and-half that I add near the end, this recipe is perfect.

This is a great recipe. The chicken is very moist. My only recommendation is to double or triple the sauce. I made four chicken breasts and followed the recipe exactly and at the end of cooking there wasn't very much sauce. We all wanted more sauce.

I have to share that this recipe is a family favorite! We now have a gluten free, dairy free kid and I just made it GF baby and it was awesome! I used Hodgsons Mill GF seasons coating mix (really good) and just added the oregano. I used earth balance butter and I always double the oil, butter (did not double the butter this time) and wines! Delish!

This was really good! My Italian husband loved it, even though he didn't love the smell as it was cooking. We both don't like mushrooms, so I omitted those. Instead of the cooking sherry, I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I also added Italian seasoning, and a lot of pepper and salt to the flour mix. I fried garlic in the oil before browning the chicken. I finished off the chicken in the oven for 1/2 hour at 350. Served it with spaghetti with a butter/parsley sauce and it was great!

Very easy and yummy.  I used chicken thighs because that's what my family prefers.  Also, didn't have Sherry so only used Marsala.  This, I do not recommend.  It was a bit too sweet.  I doubled the sauce and it was perfect over pasta.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  Someone said it took more than 40 minutes - It took me almost exactly 40 minutes (maybe less) to make this AND roasted rosemary potatoes & sautéd kale.

I loved this recipe and it was exactly what I expected. Very easy and we served it over angel hair pasta with a veggie side. I think it takes more like 40 min with prep time, but both my husband and I were happy with the end result. Only thing I would change is to go ahead and throw in the whole package of sliced mushrooms.

Really good.  I thought I had Marsala wine, but it was Sherry....so I just added some white wine instead.  It didn't have that Marsala flavor, but it was still really good...going to make again with Marsala.

I tried this dish last night! It was a huge hit! I liked it alot better than the pork marsala that I tried the week before.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful!  This is now a dish I will make often and its perfect for when you need something quick to make.

The flavor was good, but I wish the sauce was thicker.  Next time I am going to use some of the tips and use all marsala and omit the sherry.  Also, I am going to remove the chicken from the pan and make the sauce thicker with a bit of cream.

This was really good stuff.  I followed the advice of others and used the plastic bag for the coating mix, used 3/4 cup of marsala and left out the sherry.  For my own twist I added 1 cup of chopped, roasted, red peppers from our garden.  Also, I doubled the mushrooms and thickened the sauce with a little bit of 1/2 and 1/2 and a teaspoon of cream of tartar.  My husband and I really enjoyed this and cleanup was minimal for a meal that seems a little elaborate.  Now, what to do with all the leftover Marsala...

Super easy, light and tasty. Because it wasn't the creamy version my husband is Accustomed to' he didn't think he would like it. But the flavor was outstanding. I added a lot of dried oregano and pepper in the flour mixture and I think that added to the taste. This was a great recipe and I'll definitely be using it again in the future. I added twice the mushrooms cause we like mushrooms and I used a variety of mushrooms to give it some flair.

I used some garlic powder in the flour and did not use the sherry. I did add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up a bit after I removed the chicken. I have never had Chicken Marsala before it was delicious and pretty easy.

Yes more liquid is needed and I used 12 oz of fresh mushrooms. Garlic is a must and omit cooking sherry and use the good stuff.

My family loves this recipe, I made it with 5 boneless chicken thighs, and doubled the sauce recipe.  I did had a about a tablespoon of poultry gravy mix to thicken the sauce a bit.  Using fresh mushrooms makes a huge difference because the first time I made it I only had canned.  I had it with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  The sauce works well on potatoes.  Will make again soon!

I decided to take a flyer on this even though I have not been a marsala fan in the past at restaurants even.  I figured a good dish for a family dinner and man was it ever!  A few small tweaks for personal taste but nothing major and unfortunately no Marsala wine so had to finesse sherry with a less sweet wine, but amazingly it worked well.  I don't usually rate my cooking above restaurant level, but with this recipe it was amazing.  A nice garlic mash and some sauteed zucchini and squash(Zatarran seasoned)went along great with it. Not a scrap left on anyone's plate or anywhere else for that matter!

This was delicious.  I will definitely make this often.  My husband and I both loved it.  I followed the recipe as it was written except with the addition of capers. This Chicken Marsala would be perfect for a dinner party, too.

The sauce was fantastic and the mushrooms in the sauce were the best part of the dish. The chicken was good but didn't seem to pick up flavor from the sauce like the mushrooms did.

I made this tonight exactly as called for, but with a few extra mushrooms. I thought it was bland, although my husband loved it. I might try adding garlic and capers next time, as some others have suggested.

Great dinner! Wish some fresh steamed veggies, some buttermilk biscuits this was great! Only thing I did differently was cooked up some rice using chicken broth instead of water and put the chicken over the bed of rice when serving it up.. Household loved it.

I use the same recipe and it is great.  I soak the chicken first in buttermilk for about 2 hours, pat the chicken with paper towels to remove the buttermilk and then put the chicken in the flower mixture.  After browning the chicken breast, I then add the mushrooms and Marsala wine and simer everything for about an hour until the sauce thickens up.  If it gets too thick, just add a little chicken stock to the sauce.  I also never pound the chicken breast flat - I have nothing against the chicken breast; why pound it.

I have looked forever to find a recipe for marsala that was simple but delicious and this is it.  My grandma has celiac spru (gluten-free diet) and lactose intolerant (no dairy), so I thickened with cornstarch mixture and mixed with any red wine rather than sherry and it was excellent for all of us and I found something I can make for my Grandma, which is nearly impossible!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I found this a bit too greasy and would reduce the oil or butter or both. The flavor was really good though and it was simple to make.

I made this last night and my husband could not stop telling me how good it was.  He even called me this morning to tell me again, he said,"make sure you don't lose that recipe".  It was not only the first time I ever made Chicken Marsala, but it was the first time I had ever eaten.  My 12 year old son and I both enjoyed it as well.

Mm! Made this for my parents when they visited us in Indy all the way from Roch, NY. They really enjoyed it and so did my husband and I. The sherry was a nice touch. Added two 8 oz. cartons of fresh mushrooms. Yum!

Made this for company last night. Everyone went back for seconds. Use more mushrooms, and I added more Marsala and sherry. Simmered sauce separately and kept the chicken warm in the oven until we were ready to eat.  Very tasty and quick. Served with steamed asparagus and long grain/wild rice.

I've made this twice now and I really like it. Only suggestion I have is to cut back on the butter and oil a bit. Maybe 3tbs is enough? A lot of it went to the sauce and I think it's unnecessary for the sauce...it's great by itself!

I'm really pleased with the recipe - tastes great as is but I do think that the next time I'll thicken the sauce a little.  I doubled the mushrooms this time - but will triple them the next time.

This was totaly delicious. We'll definitely make it again. It didn't take that long either. I halved the chicken breasts to make them thinner before pounding them making the browning time shorter.

I made a similar dish without using the cream (it was supposed to be heart healthy)and there wasn't enough sauce.  We love the flavor!  I used Moscato wine and it was sweet but not as good as Marsala.  Realize too, that the alcohol burns off as it's cooked.  I recommend this recipe heartily!

This was my first time making Marsala chicken. My husband and I liked it but my younger kids did not..I found it to be salter than I expected, So the next time I will add a pinch and more mushrooms and onions. I served it on a bed of plain white rice which was very good.

So easy and delicious!  Chicken comes out tender with a slight sweetness.  My grandma even asked me for the recipe.  Pounding the chicken is a bit of a pain, so sometimes I just buy thin cut chicken breasts, and skip that step.

Very good, husbands favorite meal! I don't have a meat mallet so had to use wax paper over the chicken and a flat bottom glass to pound it to the best thickness (maybe 1/2 "). Simple, tasty recipe. Worth buying the Marsala and cooking sherry, you will use it making this recipe over and over again.

Super yummy.  Pounding the chicken breasts thin is a big reason it turned out so good (that, and all the butter!)... you didn't overcook the bulk of it just trying to get your thicker pieces fully cooked.  Yummy.  Funny, I didn't use any Marsala in my Marsala chicken.  I used white wine instead but I did happen to have the sherry.  Tasted great to my uncultivated wine palate.  The kids devoured this.

I liked this recipe. It turned out tender, which doesn't always happen for me with pan cooked chicken. Because I'm pregnant and being cautious to not consume alcohol, I did a substitute for the Marsala wine. I used 2 Tablespoons red wine vinegar, 1 Tablespoon vanilla and then filled up the rest of the 1/2 cup with white grape juice. It turned out well! Oh, and my daughter is allergic to dairy so I used shortening instead of butter, which I do a lot, and that worked very well also. Thanks for the recipe!

So...I tried this recipe for the very first time last night...AMAZING!!! I absolutely LOVE chicken marsala and have longed to have the Olive Garden classic right here at home and thanks to Lisa, I now have it!!! After reading a few of the reviews I made a few suggested changes. I mixed it in a ziplock freezer bag (much cleaner), I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder to the oregano/flour mix. I cooked the chicken separately from the marsala cream sauce. I started the sauce in a nonstick pan with about a teaspoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of butter and threw in some onions and fresh minced garlic with the mushrooms(I am typically not a mushroom lover, but baby bellas are my new fav)and marsala wine and I added cream and a little flour to thicken. I eliminated the sherry and used two cups of marsala wine. I cooked the chicken longer as well (not a fan of under-cooked meat) and eliminated about half of the oil and butter. This was absolutely wonderful and did not take long at all... I WILL use this recipe again soon. Delicious. Oh, I served it on angel hair pasta with a side of steamed spinach.. I am a very picky eater and so is my mother BUON APPETITO!
 ;-)

Like many others, I also modified the recipe a bit. I wanted to use up all my mushrooms from my fridge, so I used 2 c. instead of the 1 c. (I recommend this if you like mushrooms.) I also sauteed the mushrooms with 2 cloves of minced garlic before I added the wine. I listened to the other reviews and doubled the amount of wine- there would not have been enough sauce otherwise. I wanted to avoid cooking wine, but I could not find Marsala at the store. I stuck with the cooking wines, but I also added some Pinot Noir I was drinking at the time. I simmered the chicken in the wine/mushrooms as the recipe called for, but then I removed the chicken and thickened up the sauce with some cornstarch in cold water before adding the chicken again. I served this over egg noodles. Everyone in the house loved it. It was my first time making a wine sauce; I was surprised at how easy and delicious it was.

great dish, wonderful flavor, definitely one that i plan on using repeatatively.  we did notice that the flavor was much better on the chicken breast that were pounded out more.  and i used portabello as my mushroom of choice and won't hesistate to do that every time i reproduce this dish.  pairs nicely with a nice garlic mashed potato side or mushroom risotto (my preference) and of course a nice white wine.

I substituted chicken tenders, which worked out well.  My wife's comment was "great", and she doesn't do superlatives often.  She even asked how I got the sauce to come out brown, tan actually.  I assume it was from the mushrooms.  The sauce was so smooth, not to sweet, and very flavorful.  I wish I had used more marsala wine, I think it was lacking the marsala flavor I was expecting.  This recipe's a keeper!

This recipe is easy to make and absolutely yummy!  Definitely worth it to spend a few extra dollars on good marsala wine and cooking sherry.  I sauteed onion and garlic before browning the chicken and added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it.  Very important to flatten the chicken...it will not work otherwise (maybe that's obvious but felt the need to say that :)).  Such good flavor.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  My friends loved it, as did I!

I really liked this.  I've made it about 5 times.  It's a little different every time based on brands of marsala and sherry I use but it's always delicious.  I do have to make more 'sauce' when I'm done; I usually just eyeball everything and it always seems to come out right.

This was very fast and very easy so 3 solid stars. The finished product was a little disappointing. The flavor of the sauce seemed a little ‘sweet’ and lacking in complex. Could have been my fault. I did add a splash of heavy cream and additionally, I used more mushrooms than called for plus used a tiny bit of cornstarch slurry to thicken it. But it did not have a deep rich Marsala flavor. I bought the most expensive dry Marsala that I could find. At any rate, it is good enough to make again, and I will try letting the sauce simmer longer and maybe adding more ‘green’ herbs and a little chicken stock. Thanks for a really easy, fast recipe!

I made this for a pot luck with an Italian theme. Instead of the whole chicken breasts I used strips 1 1/2" - 2" long. I followed the recipe by coating and sautéing the strips. I added the rest of the ingredients and when finished I added it to al dente pasta (I used camepanelle), stirred it all in and took it in a crock pot to keep it warm. Everyone loved it!  It was so quick and easy and this preparation was perfect for pot luck style.

Yummo! Just made this tonight and WOW! I only had white wine handy and also added a miniature carton of heavy cream (read that on another recipe on this site).  Absolutely incredible! Lots of kisses and thanks from the hubby.  Seriously try this recipe, you won't be sorry! Can't wait to try this on guests:)

I had my husband's family over, this recipe was a huge hit!
I used better Marsala wine, but omitted the sherry.
Doubled up on the sauce.
Really easy to make and terrific to eat!

I made this tonight and followed the directions-almost. It was wonderful and easy. The only thing I added was to make a slurry using chicken broth and cornstarch. I served it with mashed potatoes and brocolli. Will definitely make this again.

I made this last night, and was so surprised how simple it was.  I also added 2x the Marsala and sherry (I did use the cooking wine). plus 2tbs butter when i added them. Took the chicken out after browning it and placed it into a preheated (in the microwave)casserole dish.  Then poured the sauce and mushrooms over the chicken and cooked it at 325 for about 20 minutes. :) YUMMY!

Made this twice. Loved it both times but this second time I decided to add capers and sun-dried tomatoes. I also thickened the sauce a tiny bit with a bit of cornstarch mixture.The only other change I made was I cooked the chicken then removed from pan as it was done. I did not simmer it on the stove with the sauce but added the reduced sauce later on top. YUM!! Note: Holland House brand Marsala is really not a great Marsala I have learned. I would suggest a more drier Marsala wine with less preservatives and salt.

I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts. My whole family (Husband,Son 3yrs old & Daughter 5yrs old) LOVED it! I made it over linguine w/ a side of fresh Green Beans. Far from healthy but super yummy!

Very good recipe! I did not use cooking sherry and used 3/4 cup marsala wine, and did not flatten the chicken. I also left out the butter and half the olive oil.

This was really good and so easy.  I think there was too much oil and butter for the four pieces of chicken, so next time I think I will cut that mix a bit.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped onions and about 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic when I added the mushrooms.  I added about 1 tablespoon of sour cream at the very end and it was just fantastic.  I served it over egg noodles and I wish I had left overs for lunch the next day.

I really like this recipe. I did not used the sherry wine and instead I poured more Marsala wine. I added more mushrooms, in total 100g.

I served the plate with rice with some mixed vegetables. It was delicious and got 5 star rating from the family !

Very good!  I used the redommendation to add a splash of heavy cream and a cornstarch/ water mixture to thicken.  Also added a tbs of minced garlic to the butter/ oil before putting the chicken in.  I used a large portabella mushroom cut up instead of smaller ones.  I would say 1.5X the sauce, not 2X.  I used marsala only (sub the sherry for more marsala).  I added half a package of fresh spinach (rinse, remove stem, boil in 1 cp of water and drain, add with the mushrooms).  Served with mashed potatoes. Will definitely be making this again soon.

This is a popular recipe in our house. My husband loves making it because he likes to use the tenderizer to flatten out the chicken. haha. We love finding recipes that don't require us to make any changes because it is too taxing reading all the reviews and having to make major modifications. This recipe is great as-is and goes well with any vegetable! Just wish we could fit more chicken in our pan so we could have leftovers. :-)

I left out the sherry, using the marsala wine instead. I also added a little chicken and beef bouillion to cut the sweetness. Turned out to be great and tasted almost exactly how I used to get it at an Italian restaurant.

This was wonderfull.  We used a lot more mushrooms, marsala and dry sherry, (we never use cooking wine) then thickened the sauce a bit.
I used more chicken too, but there were no leftovers :-(
Thanks for a terrific and easy meal.  Foolproof.

I JUST finished eating this deliciousness and my husband and myself loved it! Only thing I would do differently is make a side pot of extra sauce so it can be poured over the meal as most of it evaporates. Will DEFINITELY cook again!

I was very excited about this recipe, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping based on the rating. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting apple juice for sherry (didn't have any) and not pounding the chicken breasts. The sauce was too thin and not quite flavorful enough. I think I'll add some cream next time like other reviewers mentioned.

This is a staple classic for our family. Like other's in reviews I added Italian seasoning to the flour and only used marsala wine ( doubling it) (omitting the sherry) I doubled the mushrooms and added  a whole medium sized sweet sliced onion as well as fresh minced garlic when adding the fresh sliced mushrooms. I tripled the  amount of sauce and thickened it with a can of cream of chicken soup and a few teaspoons of the left over flour. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes and a side of steamed yellow squash.
 My family went gaga over this recipe, Thanks for sharing!

If you want to make 4 chicken filets... you will likely need to split this and put into two skillets... Other than that, this is absolutely delicious. My husband doesnt like mushrooms, so i kept them all for myself, but the sauce and the texture come out delicious.

Just made this.  I read the other reviews and decided to add onions, garlic, and thicken it with cornstarch.  Served it over linguine to rave reviews.  Never made it before and it was GREAT!

Really delicious and very simple/quick to make.  The sauce became a little thick/pasty when we reheated cutlets the next day for leftovers (but it still tasted good).  I plan to make a big batch ahead of time for company, so I'll just saute the cutlets the night before, then make the sauce/simmer before serving.  Thanks for the recipe!!  Love it.

Amazing meal.  I've made it many times exactly as written and it always turns out perfect.  When I don't have Marsala wine I use whatever red wine I have and it still turns out great.  I double the mushrooms sometimes just because they're so good.

We made this recipe last night and it was delicious. As always, I followed the recipe to the "T". The cooking time was dead on and the mushrooms were amazing! My only (small) complaint. Is that the breading, for being such a thin coating, became slightly soggy instead of browned. However, it was no problem just scraping that little bit off. We will be making this again! Even my 3 year old loved it!

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I. Without even having his first bite my boyfriend said, it was the best looking plate i ever sat in front of him. It was delicious! I followed the recipe as stated. So simple. Quick. Easy cleanup. So good. Definitely going to be a regular for us. Thanks for sharing!

I used cream sherry instead of cooking sherry for a sweeter taste. Also, I'm going to try adding a base to this next time for a deeper flavor. Overall, very good!

Very easy recipe and great flavor but the sauce was a bit watery.  I'm taking the suggestion of others and adding a cornstarch water slurry at the end to thicken just a little and will add a splash of heavy cream too.  This recipe is definitely a keeper but will make these little additions to enhance the sauce.

This was good but I found it didn't make enough sauce to suit us.  I added a whole cup of marsala along with the sherry and when all was done I had to
make an additional batch of sauce for the leftovers. Thanks for posting, glad I tried this but it just didn't work for us, I will stick with my tried and true recipe.

This recipe was down right AMAZING! I only used two chicken breast so I had just the right amount of sauce. I listened to a couple of the other reviews I read and added some minced garlic and more salt and pepper and added some whipping cream at the end but this all in all was one of the best dinners I've made in awhile!

Wow! Just Wow! My small town grocery stores did not have Marsala wine or cooking sherry, so I used Cabernet Sauvignon wine in place of both & it turned out incredible! This is a very romantic dish for a date night in. This was completely worth the time! Best meal I've ever cooked! Thank you for sharing this recipe! :D

I used marsala in place of the sherry.  Next time I'll leave out the oregano and double the mushrooms and double the sauce.  I used some cornstarch and water mixture to thicken the sauce.  Also used a little half and half and chicken broth.  Served over pasta this time, but next time will serve over mashed potatoes.

This was amazing!  My husband kept saying "this is the best chicken you have ever made".  Seemed like a lot of butter though, perhaps use 1 T less.

This was my first try at Chicken Marsala. We did add onion, garlic and a little cream. Served over pasta. Family liked it but thought it could use a bright note. Half a fresh lemon squeezed on top brightened it up a bit. I think next time I will try without the cream, add some chicken broth and reduce it longer before adding the chicken back to the pan.. Hubby said it was a pretty good first try.

Excellent! Family LOVED it!  Didn't have marsala - used red cooking wine and white cooking wine instead of sherry...and now reading other reviews thickening the sauce would have been super!  Used Baby Bella mushrooms cut in quarters!  Delicious!!!

This was really good, but lacking something - I think my mistake was using a 'cooking' Marsala wine, and not adding enough seasonings.  Will definitely make again, with a better wine and may add some garlic.

Excellent!  Added oyster mushrooms to the mix and the only thing I would have done differently, is thicken up the sauce in the end.  Otherwise, fantastic!

So good!  My kids went nuts for it and they are only 5 and 3.  Made the sauce with a little half and half to cut the intensity of the wine, but other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.  Make it!

Quick, Easy and flavorful.  Perfect for a weeknight family dinner yet special enough to serve company.  Made as per the original recipe and would do so again.

I followed the directions exactly as it says.  It was fantastic...even my husband said so, and I can never get him to admit he likes something.  The only thing I would change is to add more marsala next time.  There wasn't enough sauce in my opinion.  It was either that or my pan was to large to really scoop it out.  Either way, still very tasty.  I served it over spaghetti noodles with a little olive oil and garlic.  Yum!

Yummy dinner!! I added a little garlic to the oil and butter and when all was done I took out the chicken and added a little more flour and a couple splashes of  lowfat half and half it was great! I did double the oil, butter, and marsala wine to make more sauce but I would use less oil and butter next time!

Wine was too strong flavored for chicken. Chicken was ok, but mushrooms weren't. I would never cook it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! My husband came home from work and finished the rest. Only thing I thought it needed was a dash or two of salt to finish. Great Recipe.

I thought this was bland.  Didn't have enough of the marsala wine taste, and was not thickened.

Very good recipe!  It was easy to make and a big hit!  I did take the advice of some of the other reviewers.  I doubled the butter and oil and added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup of the "dredge" flour at the end to make a sauce for pasta.  I also crushed one glove of garlic and added it also, with some extra salt. I will definitely make this again:)

super strong wine flavor, had to add chicken broth to bring it down. Chicken needed more seasonings it tasted bland. It smelled delicious, but it didn't taste good, maybe I would try it again, with a better wine, and my own seasoning in the chicken.

Use less butter.  Also, add salt to the flour mixture.  Really brown that chicken, get it crispy.  I couldn't get marsala wine, and so just used a bottle of red, and it wasn't all that great.

I wanted to make something different for dinner tonight. I read some of the review and just had to make this. It was amazing!!! I made some changes, I doubled the recipe and didn't use sherry. Also added some of the extra flour mix to the sauce just to thicken it. My husband and I really enjoyed it and my 5 year old son asked for another piece!! :)

I really liked the recipe.  I always thought chicken marsala was a difficult recipe so never attempted to make it, then I found this easy recipe.  I added a small amount of heavy cream to the sauce but I tasted it before I did that and it tasted just like from a fancy restaurant.  I also butterflied my chicken breasts instead of pounding them to save time and clean-up.  Served it over mashed potatoes.

This is REALLY good!  The only thing that I did differently was add goat cheese:

After I browner the chicken in the frying pan, I put the chicken breasts in a casserole dish and put dots of goat cheese on top.  I then used the same frying pan to sauté the mushrooms and added the wines.

After the wine and mushrooms reduced a bit in the frying pan, I poured the sauce on top of the chicken and goat cheese in the casserole dish and baked at 350 for 35 mins.

Thank you for the great recipe!

I was absolutely HORRIFIED that this was going to come out bad... but it came out perfect and delicious. I was so happy! I coated my chicken in a plastic bag - it helps soo much with the clean up! I simmered mine for much, much longer than suggested and it turned out moist and amazing! I doubled the ingredients for the sauce for the pasta on the side.
Love love love this!

This dish knocked it out of the park for my family. However, if it wasn't for the other reviews and modifications then I'm not sure this would have had a chance. Removing the chicken to make the sauce AND adding some heavy whipping cream is a must if you want to receive kudos for this dish. I 86'd the sherry as well and added a couple of extra ingredients to round out the flavor of the sauce. A must try for all!

when i first tried this recipe it was fantastic. With a few of my own modification (not pounding the chicken and a change in spices), i have made it my own and in my forgetfulness, have even created variations. this recipe is great!

This is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  Best recipe for chicken marsala in the world.  Also, I have substituted the sherry for chicken broth when I haven't had it, and it's still been wonderful, but, of course, the marsala is a MUST!

I would've given this a lower score, but since I omitted the butter by choice, I didn't feel it was fair to potentially penalize the recipe which may have been a little better had I added the additional butter. 

However, no one in the family enjoyed this one. I think it may have been the cooking sherry that killed it. It seemed very strong. It was all we could taste.

This is a really easy and delicious recipe.  I used baby portabellas and added a few more of them than the recipe says.  I also finished the sauce by stirring in some half and half, which made it much more rich and creamy.

I left out the oregano and sherry. I cooked the chicken on med-high heat and put on the side to rest while I made the sauce. I added 1/2 a shallot to the pan with the mushrooms, then the Marsala. I let it reduce uncovered until 1/4 the amount. Then whisked in some cubes of butter, added fresh parsley and spooned over the chicken. If I need to stretch the sauce I add a demi glace or chicken stock after the wine is reduced.

This is the perfect recipe, delicious and easy.  I have made it several times now.  I made it for out of town company and had to give her the recipe. The only things I have changed are doubling the amount of mushrooms and adding some chicken broth to thin the sauce.  I chop the chicken into bite size pieces and serve over bow tie pasta.  I also sometimes add steamed broccoli or asparagus to the chicken and make a meal. Yum.

The entire family LOVED it!  It was so easy that my 10 year old daughter did most of the work.  It made her very proud to serve this tasty dish.  I added garlic before the chicken as well.  I also doubled the sauce.  Using real Marsala wine opposed to the little bottles found by the oil and vinegars made a HUGE difference! I did add heavy cream, but I still wished the sauce was a little thicker.
I put it over thin spaghetti with asparagus chopped into 1 inch segments.  The asparagus was tossed in butter and garlic for a few minutes then added to the pasta.  YUMMY!

My daughter made this. She is 18. The taste was excellent. I think she may have used too much oil. I will definitely make again and add some cream as others have suggested.

Very tasty! 
Double up on the 'shrooms, spices & Madiera!  
I added green beans & artichokes! 
To make enough for 4 people, use a big frying pan!

Tried this when I was looking for a quick tasty way to prepare 2 lonely chicken breasts that had been guilting me silently from the freezer for weeks. Had to make substitutions for the Marsala wine and sherry (not the most sophisticated array of cooking wines in our house...I used a bit of cab franc and a splash of bourbon for sweetness), and I threw in some sliced red onion on a whim. Boyfriend absolutely LOVED it!!! Really tender and super delicious. Plan on getting the proper cooking wines and trying this again ASAP.

This was great!  I don't care for cooking with wine/sherry much (just a taste preference) so I used chicken stock for most of the liquid with a generous pour of Marsala. I also cut my chicken into bite sized pieces before coating and cooking.  The last change was that I used close to 3 cups of mushrooms, sliced baby bellas and sliced button.  Followed the rest of the recipe otherwise.  My sometimes picky kids loved it!  Thanks!

Really liked this recipe. Next time I will use less oil - so remaining sauce can be used on noodles that I served as a side. As is, it was simply too greasy for a sauce. Very tasty.

Great receipe. Next time I will season the chicken first before coating. Was a little bland although I seasoned during the browning session. Will tweak a bit. Overall, good receipe. Try with Risotto rice ;D

I made this for dinner and it was not only incredibly easy for a novice cook like myself, but it was a huge hit! I followed the advice of doubling the portobella mushroom quantity and using light sour cream to make a marsala/sherry reduction. Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Will definitely make again.

My family loves this recipe and it's so easy.  The flavor and aroma of the Marsala make it so unique.  This is line for line and old Olive Garden recipe, with the exception of added sherry.  We asked for it once at an Olive Garden in TX and they were more than happy to share. Later I printed it off their website. You won't go wrong with this one.

Unfortunatly I was not impressed at all! Usually I LOVE the recipes on Allrecipes that are highly rated. Maybe I did something incorrect, but the sauce was runny and the flavor was lacking.

This was outstanding! I did add a bit of evaporated milk at the end (1/2 cup). Next time I will add 3/4 c. of the marsala wine instead of the 1/2 c. I think it needs more. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks :)

I made this for dinner last night and everyone agreed that this was very bland. I did cut the butter and oil in half and used all Marsala Wine.  Even with sauteeing the chicken in crushed garlic this was still way to bland.

This is a fabulous recipe! A must have in our house, and soo easy! I double the sauce amounts (butter,olive oil, marsala and sherry) and double the mushrooms as well. Oh, and do yourself a favor and use REAL sherry...cooking sherry will not do this recipe justice. My 5 year old even loves this!

This recipe was pretty good.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to use a drier wine.  With the marsala and the sherry it was too sweet for my liking.

My whole family thought the sauce was a little too sweet.  I read some of the other reviews and bought better sherry and wine.  Don't think that helped much.

Nice recipe.  I made it using suggestions from Mrs K and bhappe. I was out of chicken stock and would have made a larger volume of the sauce otherwise.  Used lots of mushrooms and also added a diced shallot and large clove of garlic to extra mushrooms. Not sure if the extra herbs i added to the flour made much difference. All in all, a nice dinner- served with angel hair pasta, roasted asparagus and a salad, parmesan on the table for those who wanted it.  It was a nice week night meal for company.

Love this recipe ! I didn't use cooking sherry though and added up some chopped, cooked bacon toward the end.  If you add the bacon, remember that it adds salt to your dish.  I also used 2x as much mushrooms as I love mushrooms.

Great and easy to make.  My family thought it was the best.. I did not use the sherry and the Marsala wine I used was of a good drinking Marsala not cooking wine.  I did add some onions chopped with the mushrooms and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I also doubled the amount of the sauce ingredients to use over noodles.  This will be a family special.

A really nice subtle but flavorful change to pasta & red sauce.  It has been added to our regular menu rotation.  We double the mushrooms and sauce.

My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about this!  It was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any sherry, so I just added 3/4 cup Marsala wine, and we both thought it was great.  Will definitely be a repeat in our house!

This is a great simple recipe perfect for a beginning cook like myself.  Loved it from the time i started using it 2 years ago.  I leave out the sherry, just by chance i forgot to pick it up at the store and have never missed it.  I add a bit more marsala than the recipe calls for, and the flavor is wonderful.  Happy cooking!

This is so yummy! Perfect for when I get a craving. I'm giving this 5 stars although I altered the recipe a little - just added more butter than was called for but definitely less than a stick of butter. My mom first cooked this recipe and my family and I loved it then. I decided to try this out on my own and my hubby and baby loved it. I paired it with Garofalo Cannolichi Rigati boiled in chicken broth and oregano. It was just delish. This is definitely a repeat.

I found this recipe bland.  Maybe cooking it longer in the wine would help, but also needs more spices and possibly garlic.

Great Recipe!!! I made a few changes though. Before flouring the chicken i dunked it in some eggs, and for the sauce I added heavy cream to the sauce and a table spoon of flour to thicken it up.  I Also cooked the mushrooms first in some butter to brown them up and added later. Thats it!!! Otherwise Gret recipe and pretty easy to make!!! Had it ready and on the table in about 50min

We are a heart-conscious home, so we used Olivio instead of butter. If going that route, go with 3 tblsp each of "butter" and olive oil. I also used 3/4 c. marsala wine instead of adding the cooking sherry to save a little money.  One packet Perdue chicken breasts made two of this recipe.

Finally! Am so happy- have tried several recipes unsuccessfully to duplicate restaurant style Marsala sauce for chicken or veal and Voila! This is it. Easy to make. This will be one of my "go to" recipes for company. Thank you Lisa.

I made 48 servings of this.  It was easy but I didn't flour it before cooking it and used olive oil instead of butter.  Everyone loved it!  I think it's better plain rather than over pasta.  If you are going to put it over pasta, you need to add some chicken broth and half and half to the pan at the end after removing chicken.  Also I top it with parmesan cheese over pasta because the pasta makes it a bit bland.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. I give it 4 stars only because even with some modifications, I felt a little something was missing from the flavor. I think the next time, I will double the oregano. I'll put 1/2 tsp in the flour mixture and another 1/2 tsp in the sauce. Here's what I did: I removed as much fat from the chicken breast as possible and beat it flat with my rolling pin (that's all I had to beat it with- worked like a charm). Added Durkees chicken season to the flour mixture with the pepper, salt, and oregano. Browned the chicken in 4tbsp of olive oil, but only 2 tbsp of butter. I did not have to add any more oil to the recipe as others have stated. This was plenty. I removed the chicken while it was still pink in the middle and sauteed some chopped onions along with about 2 cups of baby bella mrooms in the same oil. When nearly all of the liquid was gone from the pan, I deglazed the pan with 3/4 cup of Marsala cooking wine. Did not use any sherry. I added one can of Campbell's cream of chic w/ herbs and this thickened the sauce nicely. Did not have to add any cornstarch or flour. I also added 2tsp of heavy whipping cream. Last, I added the chicken back in and let it simmer in the sauce for about 7 minutes, then turned the chicken and let it simmer an add'l 7 min. The chicken was tender and delicious. As I stated earlier, I think adding 1/2 tsp of oregano to the sauce will make it perfect next time. Or a better marsala. This recipe is definitely worth a try.

I made this with tilapia, and it turned out great--just like I remember from the restaurant I used to work at, where we had two chefs from Italy. I used more mushrooms, just because I love them. This was super easy, and definitely something I'd make again.

Oh wow! This was really easy to make and delicious. After reading the other reviews, I doubled the about of Marsala and mushrooms, added a splash of chicken stock, and used a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken the sauce. I bought the best Marsala wine I could find and added chopped parsley as a garnish. Instead of having pasta with it I went with olive oil/balsamic vinegar grilled zucchini strips.

Awesome..very delicious basic Marsala.  I like to serve linguine with it,  so I doubled the ingredients for the "sauce" and ladle the sauce over the pasta as well..  It wasn't quite enough, so next time, I'll quadruple sauce ingredients (marsala , sherry & mushrooms).  Garlic bread/sticks  a must !

This really wasn't very good.  Unsure why this is the highest rated marsala recipe on here.  I followed the directions exactly, and wound up with bland chicken, albeit tender.  It was edible, but boring.  Would have been better off just browning some chicken with some allspice or something.

My family loved this recipe as written!!!  I only made two changes, I added into the flour/spice mixture, 1 packet of granulated chicken bouillon, which added more flavor than regular salt would have. We love mushrooms so I doubled the amount. As for prep,  I took another reviewers advice to put the flour/spice mixture in a plastic sandwich  bag, then added each piece of chicken then shook the bag to coat chicken. Made for a quick and easy clean up. Will definitely add to my dinner rotation!! Thanks for sharing!

This was insanely good. I couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the evening. The only thing I changed was that I added two cloves of fresh garlic to the butter/oil as it was melting, and a little bit of Italian seasoning to the flour mixture.

It was very easy to make and delicious. My guests raved over it. I used regular dry sherry instead of cooking sherry to cut down on salt. You might think it will taste too "winey" or sweet, but the wines just add a subtle flavor with the mushroom which is quite yummy. I served with spaghetti and ladled the sauce and mushrooms over that, and a side of steamed vegetables.

Excellent! I did do what one reviewer said, to brown the chicken separately from the mushrooms. I also added 1 lb of mushrooms (love 'em) and 2 cloves of garlic. Needed additional marsala...might add a bit of chicken broth too, next time for more sauce. Overall..great recipe.

4.5. Obviously I did ot read 1900+ reviews, but I thought Shasha's modifications(11-4-2010) were right on! Remember to to taste as cooking. It needed more salt, at least according to husband and son. Also added more mushrooms.Love this meal. Thanks.

This was so good I had it 2 nights in a row.  I also added some shrimp the second night.  Didn't have the oregano, used sage instead.  I'll have to pick and dry my oregano I have growing outside.

this was yummy! I did add cream at the end after reading the other reviews, and we use wine that has been de-alcohlized due to family preference. It was so good I wanted to lick the plate!

This recipe tastes great and requires much less effort than other variations I've tried before. We made two chicken breasts, not four: we still used 2/3 cup of wine and a full cup of portabello mushrooms. Adding cornstarch and heavy cream as other reviewers suggested certainly improved the sauce's consistency. Also, we'll use less olive oil next time we make this recipe.

Yummm!  Really liked this but was looking for a creamier sauce.  I used a whole package of fresh mushrooms and I definitely wouldn't use less.  I didn't have the sherry so I increased the Marsala wine by 1/4 cup.  I think I could have used a little less butter and it wouldn't have hurt either.  Family voted this a keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe states, even though I was tempted to make adjustments as others recommended.  After eating it tonight, I would suggest cutting back on the oil/butter.  It stays in the sauce and I could taste the extra fat.  I would also double the mushrooms and perhaps add a dash more of the sherry and marsala, just to  make more juice (which I could never have enough of!).  I used Golden Sherry and quality marsala wine.

Excellent! I would suggest adding cornstarch to thicken. After all ingredients were added and cooking, I removed some of the sause and thickened with cornstarch, and added back to the pan. I received many compliments and will certainly make again!

Love this recipe, I added a small amount of milk to tame the marsala wine flavor, used chicken broth instead of sherry(first time useing marsala wine and was afraid it would be to strong.) I also added about 1/4 cup copped bell peper and onion.  Turned out great.   Used flour to thinken sauce. (just a personal preference)

This recipe was excellent!!! I'm not ther greatest cook but i'm learning and this was fairly easy even for me.  I didn't have sherry so I used extra marsala and a little bit of balsamic vinegar ( like a splash) instead. It turned out awesome this is definately a keeper.

Made this for my Mother-Out-Law that was visiting from London.  She said it was "very morish!"  You can't do better than that.  I mixed a little flour with water to make a paste and added it while it was simmering to thicken the sauce.  This made a huge differance.

This was okay, but not exceptional. The biggest problem was that there wasn't much complexity of flavor in the recipe - almost all I could taste in the final recipe was the sherry and marsala. I like *some* marsala flavor, but that's not *all* I want to taste. I ended up adding a couple generous glugs of half & half to mellow it out a bit, but the marsala was still pretty overwhelming, so I added some cornstarch, which helped thicken it and mellow it a bit more. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

It was good but I changed the proportions...used tons more mushrooms, and less butter/oil. also used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Very good otherwise!

Very good recipe. Easy to follow. I did add onion powder and garlic powder to the breading. At the end the gravy was really watery so I added a little milk with some cornstarch mixed in to make more of a thicker gravy. I then added some dried parsley and some dried garlic flakes.

One of the best recipes on this site, its so good! No its great! I used a whole cupe of marsala wine( cooking wine at that!) and a Half cup of white wine a pinch of garlic in the sauce  and i added onions as well as more mushrooms and heavy cream. and thickened it with flour/water mixture. served with rotini pasta and broc. If your making this to eat with pasta your make need to double or triple the sauce because it was only enough sauce for two servings.

a bit lighter than traditional chicken marsala. If you want something light for dinner, this is a great dish.

I am not a great cook at all, but this recipe is great for beginners! The recipe is very simple and amazing! I didn't have marsala wine so I substituted it with red wine, and it was great!    I made this for my moms birthday and she really enjoyed it!

I changed this a bit. I made pasta and used the mushrooms, sherry, and Marsala with a little bit of cream and milk to make a cream sauce. I removed the chicken before I added the cream and then just put it on top at the end. It was delicious!

Pretty good.  The leftovers were better because the flavors really developed.

I was really excited about this recipe, however, my husband and I didn't care for it at all.  There was no flavor to this dish, I was really dissapointed because it has such high reviews.

Interesting, I've never had Marsala anything before so this was definitely a first for me. Didn't bother with Sherry, just used 3/4c of Marsala. I thickened the sauce with 1Tbsp cornstarch+1Tbsp water. It's not bad, but I didn't fall in love with it.

This recipe was great!  I did change a few things like using Italian seasoned bread crumbs with shredded parmesean cheese instead of the flour mixture.  I dipped the chicken in a beaten egg and then into the bread crumb mixture and pan fried.  I doubled my mushrooms and added a little more butter after I reduced down the Marsala wine to make it a little more creamy.  Our boys loved it!  I also made the Baked Asparagus and I've never seen them eat so fast or so much.  This is a keeper.

I felt like the chicken didn't really get enough of the wine flavor.  I would have preferred some sort of reduction to the sauce to intensify the flavor.  Next time I will try cooking it uncovered for a longer time and see if I can get what I want out of the flavor.

Took the advice of others, added garlic and heavy cream, used portobello mushrooms that I sauteed with onion and the result was fabulous.

Remember to actually cut the chicken breast height wise so it's thin like at Aranda's. And if too much of the pan is taken up by the chicken, find a way to fit the mushrooms in. They'll steam nicely.  Too much alcohol taste.

This meal was delicious!!! i served it on angel hair pasta. I also seasoned it with cajun seasoning (the chicken) before cooking it. I used 16 ounces of mushrooms instead and I didn't use the sherry..I only used the Marsala wine (more than it says to)..definitely a meal I will make again and again!

Delicious!  Used chicken tenders to make my life easy.  The finished product needed more salt and pepper as the only seasoning had been in the flour coating.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent recipe but I did modify it to make it creamier.  At the end of this recipe, after the chicken was cooked in the marsala and sherry, I removed the chicken and added about 1/2 C cream (heavy or regular), stirring constantly, reducing and thickening the sauce a bit. Then put chicken back in.  Dish was a total hit.

was very good, however i felt like it needs something else. Maybe next time... and there will definately be a next time... i will either make it a cream sauce as suggested by other reviewers... or maybe add something as simple as a tblspoon of capers. over all i was impressed by the ease and the taste of this recipe. thank you for sharing!

I prepared this recipe for dinner guests, following the recommendation to use twice the mushrooms and to add cream.  I used 1-1/2 cups of Marsala and added 1-1/2 cups of heavy cream and reduced the sauce slightly.   Served over linguini, this was a fabulous dinner, but definitely not low calorie.  I just printed the recipe for our guests, who are still talking about the wonderful dinner.

So yummy!  I did as others said and doubled the sauce.  I used all Marsala, no Sherry since I didn't have any.  I also added some thinly sliced onions and some minced garlic to the mushrooms.  I simmered everything for probably 20 minutes and served over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make again-thank you!

I must not be a Marsala fan as I didn't care much for the sauce. The chicken is good, my pan was too small so I did the sauce separately. I sauteed minced garlic and a shallot with the mushrooms (increased those two cups), added the wine and let simmer. Tried it and the Marsala was overwhelming (at least to me). Decided to doctor it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, milk and grainy Dijon mustard. End result was quite tasty. Maybe I should have followed the recipe a little better, but at least I found it edible with my changes. I give it 3 stars, the fiance 4. Probably won't make this again.

This was awesome.  I was looking for something simple and easy to put together with ingredients that I already had on hand.  I only had chicken tenderloins so I used those.  I added Italian bread crumbs to the flour mixture along with some crushed red pepper.  I like a little kick :)  I also used white wine with the marsala wine because I didn't have any sherry.  I took the advice of some reviewers and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I would have used heavy whipping cream if I had it.  That would have been amazing, I'm sure.  I served it with spaghetti flavored with butter, thyme, salt and pepper.

It's very easy, fast, and fantastic.  I precooked the chicken a day ahead and it only took ten minutes to from fridge to table.

I made this recipe last night for dinner.  Instead of having the pieces of chicken solid I cut them into 1 inch pieces and then coated them in the flour mixture.  I added about a tablespoon of flour to the sauce to make it a little thicker.  Very good recipe, my husband went back for seconds.  I will definately be making this recipe again.  Thank you!

Superb!  After chicken was golden I removed it and cranked up the heat.  I doubled mushrooms, wine and sherry, sprinkled some kosher salt on top and about 1 1/2 Tb. of Wondra.  Lastly I returned chicken to pan and integrated it well with the sauce. It was rich and thick!

So quick and easy to make.  Added to our regular rotation.  I used two cups of sliced mushrooms, a little bit of onion we had left in the fridge, double the marsala wine and sherry.  I don't add salt to the flour mixture.  Talking to my mom, found out she always made it with nutmeg instead of oregano and added some beef broth and flour and boiled it down until it was nice and thick.

I made this tonight for our weekly family dinners with my hubby's parents and everyone really liked it. Even my kids and 1 yr. old neice ate it and cleaned their plates. I was a little wary of cooking this cause my hubby's fam. is usally really picky, but even dad went back for seconds. I did follow people's advice and added garlic to the chicken. I also did not use sherry, cut down the wine just a little and replaced both with chicken stock and added cream. i used a bit of the seasoned flour to thicken, instead of plain or cornstarch. we ate the chicken and doubled sauce with fettucini noodles. It was fantastic, tasted just like it would eating out.

This recipe is sooo tasty.  I love it so much.  The only thing I did different is I didn't use all that butter.  It just seemed like to much.  I use about 1 tablespoon.  I also use the whole package of mushrooms.  This is an easy and great recipe.

Super easy and super delicious!  I added a little flour at the end to thicken sauce.  Next time I would invest in a better quality wine., I think that would put it over the top.  I served in large pasta bowl over pasta and fresh asparagus.  Served sauce on the side.  It looked beautiful and tasted great!

I get so many compliments on this meal, I can't even tell you. You can leave out the butter if you choose for a dairy-free meal, and I've even used other white wines in place of the sherry when I didn't have some on hand. Easiest, most delicious recipe ever.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 3/4 cup marsala and omitted the cooking sherry because I didn't have any on hand. It still turned out awesome. I have found my Chicken Marsala recipe.

I haven't rated a recipe on this site yet but this one is excellent!  Highly recommended.  I did add garlic, cream and chicken broth like another reviewer suggested.  My 19 month old and 4 year old sons both loved it. My husband said it is as good as restaurant version he has had. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the butter to try to be healthier.  I thought it was quite bland.  Does the butter make a big difference in the taste or caramelize the chicken? Also, maybe I didn't brown it enough?

I'm a big fan of chicken marsala and this recipe was wonderful and so quick/easy!  I like lots of sauce so I followed some other reviewer's advice and doubled the marsala wine and sherry.  I also added an entire pkg of 10 oz. sliced mushrooms.  (looks like a lot but they cook down significantly)  Lastly, after the chicken was finished simmering I removed and set aside, and added a mixture of 1Tbs corn starch and 1 Tbs water (slurry) along with a splash of heavy whipping cream to the sauce and mushrooms left in the skillet.  I whisked until thickened and then served the chicken and sauce over angel hair pasta.  Awesome!!!

This was really good. I have never made marsala before and i was surprised at how easy it was. The only think i did differently was, once the chicken was browned on each side I removed it from the pan and sauteed the mushrooms and onion, once browned I added the chicken back in the pan to simmer. My boyfriend loved it!

I made this recipe for 35 guests and it was great!  An easy thing to make for a crowd and it keeps and reheats very well.  I did add vidalia onion to the recipe for an added veggie.

I made this for dinner this evening, and it was a huge hit with my three boys (even my finicky teenager :) )  I followed the recipe as written, except that I used all Marsala wine, as I did not have cooking sherry.  This is a delicious, easy to prepare dish - a definite "keeper" for the recipe box - thank you, Lisa!

Great starter recipe! For me a must was double the mushrooms and sauce(next time I will triple). I only had a 1/4c of Sherry but that was more than enough.  Also added sea salt and garlic to the flour along with the pepper. Served over angle hair pasta. Quick and easy.

Very good.  I read some of the other comments about some minor changes.  I did use 3/4 cup Marsala, eliminated the cooking Sherry, and added extra mushrooms.  I served it with Fettucinni.  Excellent dinner.  Made great leftovers for the next day as well!

Excellent! Made this on a whim to use mushrooms that I had forgotten to use with steak earlier in the week. Did not have Marsala wine....used a white wine/peach flavored.  Chicken was very tender and even my picky eaters loved it.  Def. a keeper.

I made this last night. I did not change a thing.  My husband said this is really good! I asked him if it was a keeper...meaning should I make it again. He said yes.

Absolutely AMAZING Recipe.  We are huge fans of Marsala Chicken & until now couldn't find a recipe that even came close to our favorite restaurant.  This one IS IT, I can't imagine anyone not giving this great marks.  Added a little cornstarch for thickness, but definitely didn't have to~~PERFECT!! Thanks for sharing!!!

Easy and moist chicken but in spite of getting help in selecting a good marsala wine this dish had a very strong vinegar/wine taste. Not sweet and smooth like I have had and made.

Perfect as written, except for "cooking sherry".  Use the real deal it's not worth the all that extra salt.  I needed to double the recipe and found there wouldn't be enough sauce for the egg noodles.  I did taste it before making any changes and it was yummy!! I added 2 jars of Heinz Chicken Gravy.  The flavor held up/came through beautifully!  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful dish - restaurant quality. I used just Marsala vs. the cooking sherry and used cream with corn starch to make a thicker sauce. Served over garlic smashed potatos or angel hair pasta. YUM!!

good recicpe! I doubled the sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.  Update:  I did what others suggested and added heavy cream to the sauce to thicken it up and give it a creamier taste!! Much better!

My husband does not like mushrooms, so I have never bothered to make Chicken Marsala before.  This was an excellent recipe!  The only changes I made was instead of mushrooms, I used bell peppers and added about 2 cloves of chopped garlic while cooking the chicken. There was enough sauce for the chicken.  I do not see any reason the sauce needs to be doubled.  Next time, I will try a different vegetable.

I thought it was delicious, but my family was not as crazy for it as I was. I will make it again to make sure I have perfected it. The sauce was great, but they hardly touched the chicken. I followed another users tip and added a little shrimp to the mix as well, and it was very tasty in there.

I HAVE MADE THIS MANY MANY TIMES AND IT IS THE BEST.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUSHROOMS ON HAND, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.  I THINK OF ALL THE TIMES I'VE MADE IT I ONLY USED MUSHROOMS TWICE. IT'S THE SAUCE THAT MAKES IT AND THE LEFT OVERS (WITHOUT MUSHROOMS) ARE DELICIOUS IN A SANDWICH THE NEXT DAY (WARMED UP A LITTLE IN MICROWAVE) WITH MAYO AND LETTUCE.  BEST MARSALA SAUCE YOU'LL EVER TASTE.

I made this with pork instead of chicken (didn't feel like running to the store). I left out the oregano. I sauteed onions in the butter/oil... and upped the salt and pepper, also added garlic salt....easy to make, tastes great!

This recipe was very good.  I will definitely add more mushrooms next time and pound out the chicken breast to make it a bit thinner.  I will also probably use an egg wash before the bread crumbs.

This recipe was just OK. I added a mixture of half and half and cornstarch to make an actual sauce. I really don't think we would have liked it at all if I hadn't added that. This recipe wasn't nearly as good as restaurant chicken marsala.

My favorite dish at Macaroni Grill is their Chicken Marsala. My husband said that if I put this in a to go container from MG he'd never know it was homemade. I used about half the mushrooms, cooked the chicken in the bacon grease and then used every bit of the bacon grease in the dish. Fattening but TOTALLY worth it!

Made this recipe and it came out wonderful!!! Didn't have any sherry and put twice as much Marsala as it was called for (by accident) and it was great. Since my family likes mushrooms, I will probably add more mushrooms next time. Definitely a keeper---thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  I made just as instructed and it was great!  It took more like 15 minutes to get all the pink out of the chicken, but it was fantastic.  I loved it and so did the rest of my family!

Excellent!  I added some leftover rotini pasta to create a simple one-dish meal.  I did thicken the sauce with a little flour/water mixture which made it a little bland.  A little more wine balanced the flavor perfectly.  It was just a good as any italian restaurant and both of my sons (7 & 8 years old) cleaned their plates.  My husband said he was glad I ran out of canned spaghetti sauce since I found this one instead.

Wonderful dish!  I followed others suggestions and saute the mushrooms and onions in the skillet, removed and then added the chicken.  After browned added the mushrooms and onions back.  I also doubled the wine and sherry, added a touch of cream and sauted about 20 minutes.

Definitely a great simple recipe for this famous dish. I would have liked a little more flavor and felt the sherry was a little strong with how much they ask you to use but I made a few minor adjustments for my own personal taste and it worked out very well. Loved it!

Believe it or not- this is my 9 year olds favorite dish! He likes this with white rice. The only changes I make are soaking the meat in buttermilk & seasonings (usually salt & pepper) just for the extra punch. *note for those that don't cook with wine often, NEVER cook with a wine you don't drink! I'm not huge on most wines- however, I grab ones specifically for cooking based on their stand alone taste. (sampling events are great for this) Also, the alcohol cooks off for those worried!

This turned out so much better than I thought! I didn't have marsala wine or sherry, but I used the last of some merlot wine. Served it with mashed potatoes.

Since I originally rated this, I now have some sherry and it's amazing the improvement in taste of something that was already delicious! When I made this for my parents on our vacation I should have made more because they loved it and wanted the recipe! Thanks, Lisa, for this wonderful dish!

This turned out pretty good. I did feel like I had to thicken the sauce with water and cornstarch.  I also added good seasons to the flower mixture to give it more flavor as suggested.  When frying up the chicken I added about 3 cloves of chopped up garlic. I would double the sauce mixture and wine if I tried it again.  I didn't have quite enough to put over pasta so I buttered the pasta firt and drizzled with what little sauce I had.  I also chopped up some fresh flat parsely and sprinkled it on the top.

Fantastic recipe!  I added 2-3 Tbls of brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit, double the sauce and thickend it with cornstarch.  This recipe is spot on to Buca di Beppo's chicken marsala.  It is a keeper

This is the 3rd chicken marsala recipe that i've tried and the best by far! My entire family (including my 15 month old) was too busy eating to say a word during dinner. My house hasn't been that quiet for a long time. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a delicious recipe that I only slightly modified. I added minced garlic and 1/2 cup red onions. To the flour mixture I also added a dash of salt and some Mrs. Dash seasoning. I put the flour mixture and the chicken in a rectangular plastic container and shook them together. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of Marsala wine and cut the butter to about 1 1/2 tablespoon without hurting the flavor. My husband said this was the best Chicken Marsala he had ever had. I served this with skin-on garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. It is a keeper!

This dish is awesome! The only thing I did different was use all marsala wine because I did not have cooking sherry and it was great! I served it over spagetti and with a green vegetable.   I made this because I had to cook the chicken that was in the fridge or it will spoil. I was hungry, my fiance was not. When it was all ready I made a plate for myself and fed a bite to him while he was in the middle of a sentence. Well he lost his thought and had to stop and go make a plate for himslef too. So yummy and so quick to make!

I made this for BUNCO night and it was a big hit! I had a lot of requests for the recipe.  I made too much, and my husband and children ate it up (even the mushrooms!)  I did not make any changes to the original recipe and thought it was wonderful!

This recipe rocked. I added in a splash of beef broth because I didn't have sherry. Was so close to the restaurant versions! A winner!

So easy to make and it tastes fabulous! I dont like mushrooms but I love the flavor they give. I eat the chicken and the sauce but not the mushrooms. DELISH..with no modifications.

The only thing I did differently was add 3 chopped garlic cloves to the butter and olive oil and also added a little bit more mushrooms. The recipe was excellent and my guests raved over it. I served it with mashed potatoes.

This is easy and delicious - it's been a regular since I found the recipe 3 or 4 years ago.  I make it as is except I add a litte poultry seasoning to the flour w/ the other spices.  Always good, can't seem to mess it up.  Awesome w/ mashed potatoes and green beans.

Our family enjoyed this.  I don't have a lot of experience and I thought I would help to keep it moist by brining the breasts over night.  It worked however the chicken was just a little too salty.  I wouldn't recommend doing that.  I did use a lot more mushrooms than called for and the sauce I thickened with corn starch and it was awesome.  Overall we loved it!

This is a great recipe.I ate Chicken Marsala last week at a restaurant and this was just as great if not better.I did however add garlic to my butter and did not have olive oil on hand so I used veg.oil.I also omited the sherry and doubled up on the Marsala Wine.Even my picky kids loved it. There were no left overs.I will be making this again soon for family and friends.

Really nice flavour and super easy! I think I may try it with veal next time...thanks for the recipe! I always thought a marsala dish would be difficult but it tastes and smells just like it does at my favourite Italian restaurant!

I doubled the sherry and marsala like others suggested, then added a splash of cream and some cornstarch to make a sauce after removing the chicken. The mushrooms tasted like they had soaked up all the alcohol. Next time, I think I will saute the mushrooms for a while before adding the marsala wine and sherry. I will try this again though!!!

DELICIOUS! I did add a slurry at the end, to thicken up the sauce. The combination of sherry and sweet marsala wines is wonderful! I added garlic & onions to the oil/butter, prior to browning the chicken. Do what you like, it's a great recipe!!

Followed recipe as noted, stayed with the sherry and marsala, but did add garlic at the chicken browning, and chopped onions with the mushrooms. The flavor is great, sauce thickened up fine without adding additional ingredients. But I made sure the chicken was fully coated with the flour mixture. Really like the flavor!

The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly and it was good. The next time I make it I'm going to use some of the other tips I've read about and I'm sure it will be wonderful. Thank you all :)

Excellent, I made it exactly as recipe except only had 3 chicken breasts (1.5 lbs)and used a full 8 0z of baby bella mushrooms. I personally could have used even more mushrooms, love them, especially if I had cooked 4 breasts.  My husband said it was the best chicken Marsala he had ever had, and he always orders it as the restaurants.

This is one of my husbands favorite meals and this recipe did not disappoint. I didn't have cooking sherry so I just added more marsala and we love mushrooms so I doubled them. Other then that, I made this recipe as written. Will make this one again!

This is an easy recipes that is impressive for company, but simple enough to make anytime. I add onions with the mushrooms. I also use all Marsala wine (lots of it), although Sherry is probably good too.

I have made this several times, and everyone that eats it wants the recipe...I cant say enough about it! I chose to pair it with parma rosa sauce and noodles, which I think compliments the marsala taste, enjoy!

This was good. I LOVED how easy it was. Great weeknight meal. It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, but the whole family ate it up, so I can't complain.

This recipe is a keeper for sure. I made it with pre-sliced baby bellas, per one reviewer, and used skinless tenderloins.   This is something you can make on a weeknight or serve to guests without being in the kitchen for hours.  Thanks!

After making this and re-reading the recipe, I'm confused about one point. The description of this recipe states, “Herbed chicken in a sweet Marsala and mushroom sauce ..." The recipe list, however, doesn't call for either sweet or dry Marsala.  I used dry, because that's what I have in the house. It was definitely not a sweet Marsala sauce the way I cooked it, but we thought it was an excellent dish. I used 2.5 lbs. of chicken (5 breasts) and cooked it in two batches. Tripled the flour mixture. Kept the cooked chicken aside while I sauteed the vegetables, which consisted of extra mushroom (a must), to which I added shallots and fresh garlic. Added the chicken back in to the mushroom mixture with the Marsala. I'm not sure why this recipe calls for "cooking" sherry along with the Marsala.  Perhaps it's to tone down the sweetness if you're using sweet Marsala. Nevertheless, use a good-quality dry sherry, if you use it at all.  I added at least a cup of the Marsala and sherry, because I wanted more sauce, but next time I'll skip the sherry and add a bit of chicken broth rather than extra wine.  At the very end, I added some FF half and half, more cracked pepper and salt. Served over angel hair pasta with a side of crisp, French-style green beans. Delish!  P.S.  If anyone can figure out the sweet vs. dry Marsala for this recipe, please advise.

The only modification I made to the recipe was to use a different red wine because we were out of marsala. The chicken was extremely tender and the flavor was good. The recipe was very easy to make. My husband said that the sauce needed to be thicker so I will try some of the other reviewers' suggestions next time.

This is a good recipe.  I changed a few things.  I didn't flour the chicken and I added four garlic cloves, and had to use cornstarch to make the sauce thick.  I also added procuitto and put fontina cheese on top of the chicken.  It was delicious.

This is a great starter recipe! I used dry marsala wine and 1 c of chicken broth-no sherry! Added sliced onions too and served over mashed potatoes. It is sooo good! Must try. I have never had chicken marsala before, this was my first time ever eating it.

Wow, this was delicious. The chicken was so moist and everyone loved it. I did leave out the sherry because I had none on hand, used chicken broth instead and added a liitle to bit of cream to the sauce.

This was great and super easy.  I served it with garlic mashed redskins, but rice or roasted potatoes would go with it really well.  Next time I'll make more sauce and add more mushrooms.

I was surprised that I liked this so much. It was VERY easy to make. Instead of pounding the chicken out I just cut the chicken breasts in half crosswise to make my cutlets (I used only 2). Used portabellos and white mushrooms. Sprinkled sauce with a little flour to thicken up. My toddler even ate the mushrooms!

Made this a day ahead for a party I was having. Loved it!  I had to drain the grease off since there was a lot of it floating on the top and didn't want to serve to company looking greasy.  It was a big hit!

it was okay. it was a bit too salty for my tasting. i was hoping for more of a mushroom taste, rather than such a salty taste. i guess its a result of the sherry?? anyways, it was okay, but i won't be cooking this again.

AMAZING!! Very quick and easy. My husband absolutely loved it :) We love spice in our food, so I added red chili flakes and white chili powder. And like the other cooks suggested, I didn't add cooking sherry and just added some extra wine; I also added some cornstarch with a cup of water to make some sauce for my wheat thin spaghetti. But, overall two thumbs up!!

This recipe was pretty good but not one of my favorites, maybe I will try some of the other viewers suggestions as to how they tweaked it to there taste. But one thing I did different was use chicken tenderlions instead of the chicken breast. The chicken tenderlions are more tender and absorbs all of the seasoning

This was a delicious recipe.  I am a novice cook, and my husband told me that this was his new favorite meal!  It was incredibly easy!!!  I was very proud of myself for having created it!  Tasted just as good as from the restaurant.  
I did use corn starch to thicken it at the end.  Served with pasta.....was delicious!  I am going to try to triple the sauce the next time (Doubled first try, still would like more sauce with pasta cause it was delicious)

This is definetly a simple winner of a dish.I even used pork loin chops and it was awsome.Dont need the sherry though.Marsala is sweet enough.The recipe did not mention taking the chicken out after browning and adding some flour and water mixture for a thicker gravy.ya gotta try this recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make, but came out very bland. I used regular Marsala (not the premium line) and substituted an extra 1/4 cup for the sherry, since I had no sherry. Perhaps that's what was missing. Also, 1 cup of mushrooms isn't enough. I served it over buttered linguini noodles. Tasted good, but as I mentioned, not much flavour.

Awesome! I doubled the mushrooms and sprinkled them w/ flour to form a rue while they sauteed in the butter & oil. I doubled the wine. I've been looking for a good marsala recipe, this is it!

Very easy. I did not expect this to taste so wonderful being it is so simple. I did make some changes: I added a clove of minced garlic while browning the chicken. Also, while cooking I added 1/8 chicken stock and after chicken was done allowed the sauce to reduce and added some corn starch to thicken the sauce. Wonderful.

I use thin cut chicken breasts and season the flour with a little Lawry's and garlic powder. These are on my regular rotation.

I was scared to make this because I had never had chicken marsala before and I didn't know how much flavor there could be with so few ingredients, but it turned out delicious!  It was super easy and tasted fantastic!

This chicken is so yummy, so moist, so good.  This is a recipe that I use for company, over and over and over again. I have friends ask me to make this.  It's that good!  Try it and make extra sauce because it's great with mashed potatoes!

Very yummy and easy, definite repeat. Didn't have sherry or marsala wine so used 3/4 cup vermouth and worked out very nicely. Also used ital seasoning vs oregano, added 1 onion to sauteed mushrooms, and splash chicken broth to sauce like other viewers said. Recipe is definite keeper!

Thought that this was a little bland.  We had to add salt to it to be able to eat it.  I might try it again with the modifications next time.

Fantastic! Better than what some resteraunts have tried to pass off as chicken marsala.  I have mad this recipe twice now. First as written and second with additions. My family and I really like th taste the spices so we upped the oregano to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of dried thyme to the flour. Then before adding the mushrooms I addeed 1 clove of garlic. Once the wine and sherry and wine were added I let them cook a minute to blend the flavors. Finally I too a 1/2 cup chicken stock with about 2/3 of a tablespoon measure mixed in and added to the sauce. It thinckened nicely, and it was all fantastic over noodles.

I really enjoyed this meal.  I did follow some of the suggestions from other reviews such as adding onion and garlic and removed the chicken after browning; then continued to make sauce. 
I used a mushroom gravy packet b/c I did not have marsala wine on hand and added red wine per the packet; this helped to thicken the sauce as well.  I served it over buttered noodles.  
Will add to my recipe box.  Thank you.

This was excellent and so easy to do. Had this for a dinner party everyone loved it. Took advise of others and added just a splash of 1/2 & 1/2 to thicken the sauce also added a little chopped onion yum this recipe is a keeper.

The whole family loves this recipe. After I've used the flour mixture on the chicken, I add the mushrooms to the little bit that's left in the dish, stir to coat them, and then scrape it all into the pan when it's time to add it. I think it makes the "gravy" a little thicker. Also I only use 3TBS of the butter/olive oil.

I used several tips from Previous reviewers as well.  I stuck to using the two wines but after browning the chicken I removed it and sauted the mushrooms (Double the batch) in the oil/butter the chicken had just fried in.  Then poured in double the amount of wine and made a slurry of the left over seasoned flour and canned chicken broth.  Once mostly thickened I poured in about 1 cup of HEAVY CREAM!  Turned the fire way down and stired it and put the chicken back in to simmer for the 10 minutes. All I can say is YUMM YUUMMMM!!!

My husband and I love this recipe!  It is quick and easy.  Like other reviewers, I increase the amount of marsala to 1 cup, leaving the sherry at 1/4 cup.  Have been cooking htis recipe for several years and it is my old standby.  Everbody loves how tender the chicken is and the sauce is delicious over rice or potatoes.

I really like this chicken!  It was very tender, and had great flavor.  I thought the sauce was to thin,  it just ran off onto the plate, but I have nothing to compare it to, since I've never had chicken marsala before.  The flavor is delicious!  I will be making this again.

Excellent with a few modifications.

Added garlic powder (1/2 tblspn) to flour mixture. Only used 1/2 amount of butter and NO OIL to cook chicken. After I cooked chicken on both sides, I removed from pan like other reviewers suggested. I deglazed the pan with marsala wine and added the mushrooms and some red wine (1/4c) b/c I did not have any sherry. Let them cook for about 7 minutes then added  a small mix of flour and red wine to the pan to help thinken the sauce. After it thickened, I removed the mushroom mixture and placed the chicken back in the pan and added some marsala wine to cook the chciken a few more minutes. I served the marsala sauce on top of the chicken and mashed potatoes - it was excellent!

This was just OK.  The "sauce" was very thin and esentially boiled or poached the chix when you cooked it.  I think I might try this again and remove the chix before reducing the Marsala sauce and at least give it one more shot.  I really don't like boiled chix.

Really really good. Here are my little tweaks/suggestions:
I cut the chicken breasts into about six pieces each before pounding them and also make sure and trim the fat.  After removing the chicken from the skillet, I deglazed it with about 1/4 cup marsala and dash of sherry.  After it reduced by about 1/2 I added about 1/8 a cup of cream and stirred/cooked for about 1 minute more. Poured it over the top of the chicken. DELICIOUS!!!!

What an absolutely simple, yet elegant and really delicious recipe! I had printed the recipe up a while ago and may have used it before in another version,but never made it as listed until just now, on the request of my husband. The recipe is deceivingly simple. At the last 15 minutes of cooking, the sauce thickens up nicely. I had fresh oregano in my garden so used 2X the amount recommended for dried and it was very tasty. I also added chopped fresh garlic while it was cooking covered. Paired with fusilli pasta, my family loved it.
Definitely a keeper recipe!

I used Whole Wheat flour-Cant even tell! I cut the butter and oil in 1/3 too keep the calories lower, Served with Whole wheat pasta- It was great!  

Also- when breading the chicken, put 1 piece at a time in a small rectangle tub, shake it side to side several times. This will give it a solid coat which is needed during browning!

Wow . . . I just made this and my family couldn't get enough.  The sauce goes great with angel hair.  The only thing I omitted was the sherry (didn't have any).  It is a quick and easy recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe! And it was fast and easy to make! My boyfriend loved it. I would recommend following the other suggestions and adding some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Otherwise, it's perfect!

This was a nice easy recipe that produced a delicious meal.  I took the advice of others and was glad I did otherwise I don't think the chicken would have had as much flavor - added 1 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. basil and 1/2 t. Mrs. Dash garlic seasoning blend to flour mixture - used plastic bag to coat chicken.  I used 3/4 of the amount of butter and olive oil and doubled the sauce  - it was just enough, but next time I would probably triple it.  It definitely needed thickening and I removed the chicken/mushrooms after simmering, placed them covered in the oven to keep warm and thickened the sauce with 1/2 cup of half and half and 1 T. of corn starch.  I served it over thin spaghetti.  It was delicious and everyone really liked it.  I would definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe but the chicken came out a bit thick.  I have had chicken marsala a couple of times at a restaurant so I don't know if the consistency of the suace was right.  Even if it was, I would have preferred a lighter sauce. I also added some garlic and shallots with the mushrooms.  That gave it just a little more flavor.

This also works excellent with PORK Chops. Like the other reviewers said, you need to thicken the sauce with cornstarch/cream and use the sherry as it is very important for the overall taste. You can never use too many mushrooms!

Wow, this recipe was delicious and enjoyable to make.  As per the suggestions of other reviews, I added garlic powder to the flour mixture, minced garlic to oil/butter mixture then some broth, fresh parsley and creams to the sauce.  I prepared a rotini pasta tossed with light olive oil, parsley and parmesan cheese.  My boyfriend loved it as well did I.  The best marsala I've had.  Thank you for the suggestions and most of all, for this fantastic site that has enhanced my cooking experience!

This was good but the Sherry and Marsala flavors were a bit too strong in taste for me!  I've made it three times now and have found out I don't care for the dry Sherry but prefer the Golden.  I also ended up adding some broth into the sauce in the end and then thickening with cornstarch/broth.  I also decided this time to brown the mushrooms first since they wont brown in the liquid.  It keeps getting closer to what I'm hoping for!  :)

Very very good! I will use this  as a "base" recipe for my own changes. I used the sweet Marsala wine...next time I think I'll try the dry. I also thickened it up a bit. Served over angel hair pasta. Really enjoyed this dish. Thank you.

Wonderful recipe!  I also added more mushrooms and cornstarch and water.  Next time I will add garlic and cream.  It does not make enough gravy on it's own.

My husband and I really enjoyed this with a few modifications.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and coated the chicken in a zip-lock bag.  Toward the end of cooking, I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and half and half.  And I used 10 oz. of mushrooms just because it was the size of the package.  There seemed to be something missing and also a little greasy for my taste; it probably wouldn't be for most people, though.  Next time, I will try sauteeing with some garlic and onion, half the butter and oil and add a little salt.  Very good.

This is a favorite of mine. I usually add more mushrooms and sometimes add some heavy cream at the end or a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce. Serve over mashed potatoes and some steamed asparagus and you think your at a nice italian restaurant.

I really liked this and thought this was easy to make. My husband thought it was not as flavorful as it could be. I did cook the chicken and then removed it to keep warm. Then cooked the mushrooms seperately. I did not have any sherry so i just used white wine along with the marsala.

Yum!  I combined all the dry ingredients in a plastic bag and shook one breast at a time.  I used thin chicken breasts.  After chicken browned I sauted mushrooms and 3 cloves of chopped garlic.  I used 1 cup Marsala wine and 1 cup chicken broth.  I thickened with some cornstarch.  This was wonderful.

Seeing as I made it originally when I was living in a dorm, I was apparently without anything to flatten the breasts down when I decided to make this, nor did I have a cover for my frying pan. The result was too much reduction (almost 0 left over except for the original oil) and longer cooking times to make sure the thicker chicken was done through. However, tail pieces where the breasts were thinner showed just how good this recipe could have been! As with others, I used extra marsala instead of sherry as well as adding a touch of light cream. I left out the mushrooms as fiance is not so keen on them. I'm going to make again tonight and this time I'm adding a little broth along with some garlic as suggested here. Now that I have my own kitchen, though, I can't imagine it's going to turn out anything but amazing.

This is a great Marsala recipe. I have used this recipe twice now. Both times I substituted Veal for the Chicken & it turned out great. Once I used the Marsala Cooking Wine (you can't buy real wine on Sundays in Georgia) & it turned out just fine but I prefer to use real Marsala wine because the flavor is much richer. Like others, I doubled the sauce to have enough for our pasta. This is now my standard Marsala recipe. Thanks for submitting it.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and I didn't change a thing!  My only complaint was that there was not enough sauce, so in the future I will double the oil, butter, marsala, and sherry.  I also plan on adding more mushrooms, but I am a mushroom lover.  I served it with Rachel Ray's "Rice Pilaf" recipe.  It was a perfect combination!

Good recipe, very tasty.  I did make a few minor changes though.  Based on some of the other reviewers' suggestions, I added garlic (4 cloves) and one medium onion to the pan and sauteed them before adding the chicken.  I dipped the chicken in egg before putting in the flour mixture, which I also doubled.  I doubled the mushrooms and tripled the wine/sherry mix.  I added a generous amount of Italian spice to the pan while the chicken was simmering.  Once the chicken was done, I removed it from the pan and added the leftover flour mixture to the sauce to thicken.  Served with mashed potatoes & green beans.  Tasted like the chicken marsala from our favorite restaurant!  Thanks, Lisa!

ok, so I never follow a recipe as given. Usually because I don't have all the ingred. I browned the chicken as called for, then I removed them from pan, added mushrooms and about 1/2-1 cup chicken broth. I cooked the mushrooms and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. When that was all blended and cooked, I added the chick back to pan and cooked it on low for about 25 min. It is so good. Cooked in under 30 min and my husband though I cooked for hours. Served with pasta nad cauliflower. Thanks for the recipe. he marsala and sherry are a great combo.

I sound like Randy Jackson saying this, but this was just okay for me.  I thought it was kind of blah.  I served it with instant potatoes and canned turnip greens, and they had more flavor than the chicken.  My advice, make sure you have a bite of potatoes with every bite of chicken to give it flavor.  I noticed when I made a chicken recipe about a month ago that had cooking sherry in it, I thought it was blah too, so maybe that's the flavor I don't care for.  I love the stuffed chicken marsala at Olive Garden, but I think it's the stuffed part I love so much.  I will have to learn how to make that.

Super good but I had to modify the recipe slightly. After browning the chicken I took it out of the pan and kept it warm in the oven. Then I sauteed the mushrooms and added 3/4 cup Marsala, 1/4 cup Sherry and 1/4 chicken broth. The sauce is so good you need to at least double it. I then put the chicken back in and thicken the sauce a bit with some cornstarch and water. Very delicious!!

I always use this recipe when I make chicken or veal marsala, just finally got around to writing a review.  I am not crazy about marsala sauce, but my husband loves this!  I usually use about 3/4 c marsala and omit the sherry.

Pretty Good. I added Garlic and a little white onion to the oil and butter. We put it on top of speghatti. It came out great. Next time we might add a few more things for some more flavor.

My husband made this recipe this weekend and we both loved it.  We increased the wine because we didn't have Sherry, and added a little onion but other than that, it was made just like the recipe. Next time we may add a little bell pepper along with the onion because we love it, but other than that it was perfect as is.

I've been making this recipe for years with just some small changes in the process: Instead of pounding the chicken, I cut into bite sized pieces. Like others, I also use a gallon size plastic bag to first mix the flour and spices and then add the chicken. I always double the mushrooms and at least, double the marsala and sherry (shame on me but I use cooking wines for both - Holland House is good and we like it - but no I would not drink them)as I serve this with either red or mashed potatoes. And lastly, I melt 1 TBSP butter and add 1 TBSP flour, mix and then add to the wine sauce to thicken a bit more before serving. This is a quick, easy and delicious dish without tweaking...Thank you, Lisa!

I made this for dinner tonight. Turned out pretty good. I added onion, and a splash of whipping cream. Left out the sherry and used a 3/4 cup chicken broth. Had a good flavor but it was missing something. I will try again. Thanks for sharing

Very easy and pretty yummy. I added parsley and a little basil to the flour dredging mixture. I also removed the chicken after sautéing and used only Marsala. Though next time I'll use a dry vs sweet Marsala.

Great recipe. I made a few alterations, that is why I did not rate it a 5. I added a few whole cloves of garlic, while the chicken was cooking. I removed the chicken, then added the mushroom and marsala twice as much as the recipe called for and did not add the Sherry. I also added chicken stock with wondra to make the a thicker sauce. Also added a small amount of heavy cream to make it a little creamier.
Served it over angel hair. This was as good as my favorite Italian Restaurant,
I also don't ever buy wine I am not willing to drink, so I bought a nice bottle of Marsala which added great flavor.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I doctored it a little bit. I'm sure the recipe is good as is, but everyone has their own personal taste :) I began with cooking 2 pieces of chopped center-cut bacon, then removed the bacon and added just about 1 T olive oil to the pan. I followed the rest of the recipe, only adding fresh garlic, chopped vidalia onion with the mushrooms (a must! it was soooo good), and then to just thicken the sauce a bit at the end I put a splash of fat free half & half. Then served with the bacon mixed in. (I would make this recipe without bacon too, but it added a nice flavor if you happen to have it on hand) Yummy!

This is the first time I've made chicken marsala. I used more mushrooms and didn't have sherry so subbed in red wine. The chicken was extremely tender. Both me and my husband enjoyed this. Many thanks.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband and son. I made it last night and it was so good. I even e-mailed it to my sister in law who makes it to give her my recipe from allrecipes.com. I served it with white rice and green beens and there was no leftovers. Thanks for such a great chicken recipe to make Al

Fantastic!  Easy and delicious. The only change I made was to omit the Sherry and increase the Marsala. I made it for the luncheon following a friend's funeral. Everyone raved about how delicious it was and wanted copies of the recipe. Thanks.

This was delicious, very easy to make. It's nice that it's a one-pan meal. Probably super delish because of all the butter and oil. I didn't have any sherry so I used 3/4 cup marsala.

Looked beautiful; we were so excited to sit down and eat, but there was no flavor to this dish.  I may have left it on the stove too long after I added the wine.  I could not taste it at all.

This recipe is THE BEST!!!  My husband and I have prepared this 3 times in the last two weeks - we LOVED it!!!!  If you are eating this w/linguine - as we did - then I recommend doubling the Olive Oil/Butter/Marsala/Sherry - to pour over the linguine.  YUM!!!

Although my picky son and I liked this the rest of the family voted no. I did make a gravy out of the wine sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.

Delicious. I didn't change a thing about this recipe except I thought to add just a touch of water (would probably be better with chicken broth) about 4 minutes before it was done because the sauce was getting a bit thick on me. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender. The sauce was sweet and delicious and the wine made a great after dinner sipper!

Like it as a base. Needs more pepper, oregano (or italian seasoning), garlic and I would absolutely pound out the chicken as directed (I did not and it wasn't as good). Would use it again with some additions!

Perfect!  Much better than any restaurant chicken marsala I've ever had, and it is one of my favorites.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  They were yummy.....juicy and tender, and used the "steak cut" mushrooms.  The heartier cut was a good choice for this recipe.  No other changes necessary.  Totally delicious and easy.

Excellent recipe!  I use 3/4 c. marsala wine and no sherry, 1/2 the butter and oil, and sometimes add a splash of fat free half and half at the end, if I have it on hand.  Either way, this ALWAYS turns out great!  It's quick and easy, and makes me look like an awesome cook.  What more could a person ask for?

I didn't especially care for this recipe. But, I did use just Marsala and no sherry. I used a sweet Marsala but maybe it would have been better with the dry. I will try it again though.

For someone who never has made marsala, this recipe was very easy to use and follow. It was VERY popular in my house. Firstly, I breaded the chicken, and then re-breaded it right before going into the pan for a great flavor. Then, I cooked the chicken first (I only have a large 'all-in-one' pan that did not fit all the chicken at one time) and placed on a covered plate. While I was doing that, I began to sauté the mushrooms in a seperate frying pan with the same oil and butter mixture which you cook the chicken in. After the chicken was done, I put the mushrooms into the first pan and made the sauce, then added the chicken back in to simmer and soak up the sauce. It was delish! I served it with thin angel hair pasta. I definitely will be making this again soon!

I did a test run last night, in preparation for a dinner party this weekend and it was great. Many more mushrooms are a must! I also used Whole wheat flour instead of white flour. Has anyone else done the same???

I did not care for this recipe. First the chicken was too bland and the flour made the chicken turn out cakey. I will try this recipe again. Except time I will pan sear my chicken with better seasonings and then make the marsala sauce. Also I took other advice and added cornstarch to make sauce thicker.

Excellent dinner!  I did add some onion and garlic to give it more taste too.  This is a keeper of a recipe!

yummy! I added some fresh lemon juice and zest to add a little acid into the sauce. I also have to say I added about 4 chopped garlic cloves, dried pepper flakes and sherry (not cooking sherry). I think I ended up taking the chicken out and reducing the sauce a bit more too. But this is really delicious!

Very Good.  Next time will add some corn starch to sauce to thicken.  Very tasty and a big hit with my husband!

This was absolutely fantastic. Cooked it for Christmas.  My 8 year old and his friend rved about this dish. Gave the recipe to my boss (male) and he tried it on his wife and kids and got rave reviews as well. Neither one of us are cooks but this made us feel like we could do anything. I would not change a thing on this recipe.

I think I had this on the table in less than a 1/2 hour and we were practically licking our plates!  Used more mushrooms than called for, but other than that, didn't stray too much...thought the sherry was a nice addition.  Thanks for posting!

So tasty and so easy! I used thin-cut chicken breasts and 3/4 c. marsala wine sauce (instead of the cooking sherry). I'll definitely make this again.

This is great!  My husband loved it.  I would just add that I used a sweet Marsala wine and thought this made a big difference as opposed to a dry one.  Enjoy.

I made this adding 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 2 T fat free half and half. I also thickened it with a rue made of flour and water. It was great. I also added pieces of chopped ham.

This was awesome. I have had this in restaurants before and loved it. It was also a big hit with the family. I used extra virgin olive oil with oregano flavor. Side dishes were mashed potatoes and string beans. Always a veggie.

This was delicious and the sauce turned out so well. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding more mushrooms. The next time I make this, I will try adding some carrots for some color. I served over buttery, angel hair pasta with mixed veggies on the side. Yum!

I didn't like this at all. The coating on the chicken just fell off in the sauce, all sticky and gross. It was sort of bland and seriously needed some salt. I won't be doing this one again.

Very rich and buttery! I used amontillado instead of marsala/sherry, but it has the same flavor. I also used canned mushrooms because that was all I had on hand. Great flavor, though I ended up adding more amontillado because the dish needs more liquid.

I thought I followed this to the tee but I just didn't care for it. I've had much better in restaurants. I did, however, try thickening the sauce with a little cornstarch and water, but in the end, I just didn't care for sauce's flavor.  Perhaps a cheap Marsala was the culprit.

Very tasty.  My husband loves chicken marsala and he thought this was delicious.  The sauce was not as thick as I would have liked . Next time I'll add some more flour.  I might also try a small amount of sour cream to give the sauce more body.

AWESOME!!!  I made this for a non traditional Thanksgiving meal & it went over VERY well.  I order Chicken Marsala in restaurants quite often but this was the best I have ever had.  It was a little rich for my husband but I loved it as did everyone else.

We love this recipe. I haven't tried it with the sherry just the marsala and it is excellent. I double the mushrooms because we can't enough of them! This is a quick and easy recipe. It's become a regular at our house.

Really yummy!  Didn't have to use the oil and butter to brown the chicken, just butter. Halved the salt, doubled the sauce and thickened it. Be sure to use fresh mushrooms. Whole family loved it with egg noodles!

This is one of the first recipes I tried off of this website and still one of the best.  I like to make it with the Mizithra Browned Butter Pasta on this site so that it's like going to the Spaghetti Factory.  Not a healthy meal-but so good!

Judging from the reviews, I see that it must have been my fault, but this was just not good for us. My husband didn't even like it, and he eats everything! I thought the flavors were quite jolting and not well-balanced. Maybe I should try it again based on the many positive reviews.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I make it without the sherry just because I never have it around. I just add a little more marsala wine. Make extra sauce and serve the chicken on top of linguine with the extra sauce.

WOW was this good! I followed other reviews and only used Marsala cooking wine, no sherry, and it smelled and tasted great! The chicken came out super tender and juicy. I served it with pasta alfredo and zucchini. I might add more mushrooms next time, 'cause I love 'em! Thanks!

I read reviews and cut the butter and oil in half and double the marsala and sherry. Also, I added a 1/2 cup of green onions (we like the flavor it adds). The cooking sherry made this a lot sweeter then we are used to. My husband like it, I thought it was ok. If I make it again I will adjust the sherry and marsala a little.

Delicious, tender, flavorful... doubled the sauce and used chicken broth instead of sherry.  I used 1 cup of button mushrooms and 1 cup of portobellos.  After the chicken was cooked through, I put it aside and kept it warm while I added about 1 T of cornstarch mixed with chicken broth to thicken the sauce.  Then I added about 3 T of cream and 3 T of chicken broth.  It was creamy, delicious and indulgent.  GREAT recipe and I wish I had leftovers :)

Well the picture looks great! All the more convincing for me to cook something I've never even tasted. My uncle mentioned Chicken Marsala before I never got to taste his and I happened to have Marsala cooking wine that I picked up not knowing what would become of it. Anyway, my first time experiance in cooking/tasting this dish was fair yet disappointing. Now this is ONLY BECAUSE, instead of chicken breast I had drumsticks duh!! I kinda knew i was a bit doomed, however i just ended up frying like instructed (in shallow grease/butter mixture), then baking due to bleeding, then simmering, then baking in simmering pan lol. I also underestimated the power of flour, I tried to thicken just a bit and I think I got a graet mushroom-gravy-marsala mixture. Well with all the disasterous bleeding, I ended up with something more of a chicken smothered in gravy. lol Since I haven't had chicken marsala before I have nothing to compare my dish to (except the picture) lol...so I'll have to try again nextime with actual chicken breast. Only after getting my husband's opinion after he is in from work. I wish everyone else better luck

I love this recipe. My wife and I would go all over to different kinds of resturants and she would order chicken marsala to see which one she prefered. Haha and after hundreds of dollars I finally said "hon come on I can make this" and after finding this Website none of those resturants can compete with me. Thank you so much, I dont mean to be rude but the only thing I would change is that in a side note that if you wanted a thicker sauce that when I throw that sherry and marsala in I throw some of the all purpose flour in... But anyways it is still great, family and friends are amazed how great I cook this meal.

This recipe rocks.  I did tweek it.  I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth more mushrooms,  trippled the sauce and a 1/4 cup of heavy cream which I think made it much better.  I also thickened with flour and water mixture so it stuck so well to the chicken.  I served with mashed potatoes and brown sugar glazed sugar pea pods. A plethora of compliments came in.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was super easy & soooo good!  I seriously wanted to lick my plate when I was done.  I added extra mushrooms to mine & after it was done cooking I removed the chicken & stirred in a little cornstarch to make a gravy/sauce to pour over the chicken.  Loved it!

Maybe I had a bad brand of Marsala... but I couldn't handle this. Neither I nor my husband enjoyed this... we did not save the left overs. Sorry. I'll try it with just white wine next time... not the same, I know, but as much as I enjoy ordering chicken marsala in restaurants, I will never make this again.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have any sherry so I added more marsala wine and a lot of mushrooms. I took others advice and added extra seasonings to the flour.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and oregano. I did pound the chicken to cut cooking time. I used some flour to the end with the wine to thicken the sauce.  Everyone asked for seconds, we had no left-overs.

This was O.K. It was to thin of a sauce. NO salt. It needed something. The wine was very strong even cooking it off. Fresh oregano is always better. Did not care for this recipe. I have had better.

Great recipe!  I doubled the sherry and the marsala so I had plenty of sauce for a side of angel hair pasta.  I added a bit of chicken broth and thickened it up with just a touch of cornstarch.  Like other reviewers I doubled the mushrooms and used a variety.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks!

I made this for my family who loves mushrooms.  I don't care for mushrooms at all.  The only thing I did differently was add some onion.  My husband LOVED this!  My daughter liked it alot.  I hated it.  It seems like the Marsala didn't cook out of it enough.  I don't know what it was, but I did not care for it at all, but my hubby loved it.

As one reviewer suggested, I served it with angel hair pasta, which did go nicely with it.  However, I just wasn't impressed at all.  I thought for sure with all the reviews, it would be excellent, but I found it instead to be very bland.  Something was definitely missing here.

This recipe sounded much better than it really was.  I made it tonight, added more marsala, cream and fresh parsley and it STILL lacked something...I just can't put my finger on it though.  Won't be using this rendition of chicken marsala again.

Was good, but I've had better. I think I'll try olive oil intead of butter next time. With the butter it was a bit too greasy.

I have never ordered this in a restaurant, so I don't have a standard to compare it to.  However, it seemed pretty good and relatively easy to make.  I used cremini mushrooms for more flavor and let the wine reduce a little before adding them to the pan.  I also had to thicken the sauce up with a little cornstarch.  Otherwise, it was very light and tasty and will probably  make again.

Very good overall. Thought the mushrooms were a bit overcooked. Might start them a little later. Needed a bit of cornstarchto thicken sauce.

Great recipe!! Will definitely make it again. Did make a couple of changes.. I used ½ of the oil and butter as requested .. added a tablespoon of chopped garlic when browning the chicken. I also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce as other members recommended and of course doubled the sauce. Turned out fabulous.. Next time I will try adding chicken broth to get extra sauce :)

Thanks Lisa!

Wow!  This was really, really good!  Made according to the recipe, except I tripled the mushrooms.   GREAT RECIPE! Thanks Lisa.   UPDATE:  I made this again and unfortunately discovered that the quality of the wine makes a huge difference. I used a lower quality wine and it was not nearly so good.  It didn't even seem like the same recipe.

This was a good and easy meal.  I followed some recommendations of previous reviewers: doubled the fresh mushrooms and added them after letting the wine burn off for about 5 minutes; added cream of mushroom soup to make more sauce. I served it over angel hair pasta.  Next time I will try adding something to make it a bit more flavorful...

I am soooo glad I chose this recipe.  It was sooooo good, I have made it twice in the past week.  

I omitted the wine but followed the directions exactly.  Came out so delicious.  Even my 2 year old was asking for more.  

Would be good with Mashed Potatoes.  Husband approved!

I wasn't too thrilled with this. The chicken and sauce were kind of bland.

I made this tonight for dinner for my mom and my husband and we thought it was a little ho-hum for us...not a lot of pizzaz.  The flavour wasn't offensive, we just found it a little bland.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll keep looking.

This is a terrific and easy dish.  I've started making it at least once a week.  I use whole wheat flour for coating the chicken, and I add 1/2 c. of chicken broth in addition to the marsala wine and sherry to increase the amount of sauce to serve over whole wheat linguine.  Talking about it makes me want to cook it again for dinner tonight!

Very good and so easy to make. I served it with Angel hair pasta. I also browned the chicken in olive oil instead of butter--to make it healthier. This one is definitely a keeper!! Thanks for the great recipe.

This is soooooo good but I made a little modification.  Right before serving I add a little heavy cream to smooth it out.  I also add more oregano as it cook.  With some sauteed baby spinach and whole wheat pasta it's the best.  Thank you.

This recipe was delicious, my fiance loved it.  I would have to say that the choice of Marsala wine is a big part of the taste.  I chose a sweeter Marsala and it hit the spot.

This Recipe is great!   I've made it for my boyfriend twice and both times he's gobbled it up. I usually put in about 3 times as many mushrooms as the recipe calls for, just because i love mushrooms.

We loved this, and it didn't last even though I doubled the recipe. I used red Marsala(21 sweetness). Next time I plan to pound the chicken a bit thinner and I will more than double the Marsala and the mushrooms because they seemed to disappear. These ingredients are really what makes this dish special. I also skipped the sherry.

I used only olive oil (rather than olive oil and butter) and substituted dry white wine for the sherry.  The chicken was very tasty, but I will probably double the mushrooms next time.

Good recipe....except sauce a little to runny and marsala a little strong. definitely  do see some potential in this dish with a little less wine and something to thicken the sauce a bit.

I guess I'm used to eating a more creamier version of this dish since I've only had it at restaraunts but I was really disappointed in the end result when I made this.  First time this web site has let me down.

This was a very pleasant & easy dish to whip up. Basically I don't really like to coat my meats with flour so I browned it seasoned with just a little salt & pepper. I added more chicken broth, doubled the Marsala Wine & also added half a cup of sour cream. However I did add flour to thicken up the sauce a little. This went very well with rice & pasta!

I'd originally rated this 4 stars but came back to rerate is when I found that doubling the amount of liquids makes the tastes come out so much more.  Delicious and easy.

I have made this recipe several times and you can't go wrong.  I have had friends substitute the the sherry with chicken stock and they didn't get the same results and admitted that this recipes was better.  Add some sweet onions as well to cook down with the mushrooms....amazing!

An excellent marsala.  If the coating is a problem it is just as good without. I find if I am using previously frozen chicken and it is not TOTALLY and complete thawed you have a bit of a problem with the breading not sticking as well to the chicken as it should.  Only change I've ever made is adding a bit of chopped garlic.

Where's the sauce?  This recipe was very tasty, but there was definitely a need for more sauce.  I always try to follow a new recipe exactly, the first time and I would increase the amount of flour to facilitate more sauce.

Over all this was pretty tasty.  Next time I might not add as much oil and butter, just to make it a little less fatting.

HOLY MOLY LISA!  This was excellent!  I only made a few changes to accomodate the people I was serving (a 20-person bridal shower!). After I floured the chicken, I also egged and breaded before I friend (kinda like fancy chicken fingers).  I used chicken tenders instead of whole breasts for easier buffet serving.  I also used about the double the amount of mushrooms.  This was excellent - YUMMY!

Could use a bit more salt and I tend to think that the butter/olive oil combination makes it taste a bit too oily. A touch of lemon is also good with the recipe.

This was a great recipe and the only additions/changes I made was that I used whole wheat flour and added 3 cloves of garlic.  I also added the merlot wine because I was out of sherry cooking wine.  It was a little watery so I added cream of chicken soup.  I would add cream of mushroom soup the next time and it thickened up very well!  It was great!

This was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was tender and the flavors blended together perfectly.  To top it off, it was so easy and quick to put on the table.

This is the best recipe I have ever found for Chicken Marsala. The ONLY thing I add is a 2 tsps of browning sauce. It just makes the sauce a little thicker and gives it a little kick!

Great Recipe!  This is my wife's favorite dish so I thought I'd give it a try.  The only thing I did different was cut the chicken in roughly 3/4 inch cubes.

This recipe is wonderful, I made it for my boyfriend and I for sweetest day. He loved it! I served it with garlic mashed potatos , shrimp scampi and a ceaser salad...it was great! I to only used marsala wine instead of sherry and I added more mushrooms because we love mushrooms other than that it was the same. thanks!!

This is the best marsala recipe out there!  My husband is a bit of a connoisseur of chicken marsala, and this one is at the top of the list.  He requests this at least once a week.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  This has surely been added to the normal rotation.

Good recipe. For the best result, tenderize and marinate the chicken in the marsala wine at least 8 hours in advance.

Wonderful, except I think I put a little too much olive oil in.  I doubled the recipe and I think that I'd keep it at 4 next time I try this.

Great recipe!  I will definitely make it again.  Per the other reviews, I only used half the amount of butter/oil, doubled the mushrooms and marsala wine, and omitted the sherry.

My husband inhaled this recipe!  I did, however, change it a bit.  I doubled the amount of marsala and sherry.  I also minced some garlic and tossed in 1/2 while the chicken was browning and 1/2 with the mushrooms.  I was out of oregano so I added a dash of onion powder, thyme, and rosemary to the flour mixture, yum!  We also followed previous recommendations and mixed a touch of flour in the sauce to thicken it up just a little.  Finally, my husband and I like our food spicy so I garnished with red pepper flakes and served over orzo pasta.  He cleaned his plate and was disappointed that I only made two servings!

I more than doubled the mushrooms, and would highly recommend that.  Also, be sure and flatten your chicken to 1/4 inch...it makes a significant flavor difference.  Next time I will try adding a little flour/water mixture and see if I can't thicken the sauce a bit.  Yummy recipe, and impressive for having guests.

This certainly was a very simple recipe to make, but I found it really lacking in any sort of flavor.  The mushrooms were the only flavor, really.  I think the ideas to add a cream at the end might be nice, or maybe it just needed more marsala.  I'll give it another shot though because it was so simple.

This recipe was so delicious, with a few variations!  I ommitted the cooking sherry and added some cornstarch to the marsala.  Next time, though, I think I'll use 2 or 3 packs of sliced mushrooms instead.  I served it over wild rice with broccoli and everyone loved it.

Gorgeous and delicious with the incredible sauce. 
I use a mix of button and cremini mushrooms; it makes a richer flavor. I also double the sauce. I've made this a number of times for company and it's always a smash.

Second time making this and tonight I made it for company- bad idea!  Everyone agreed it was very bland, even thought I purchased a $10 bottle of Marsala.  Good thing is that I tried a the Roquefort Pear Salad from this site and it was AWESOME!

My whole family loved it.  I took some suggestions listed and ommitted the Sherry Wine plus I cut the olive oil in half. I also added some chopped garlic and onion as suggested and regretted it, because the taste really lingers in your mouth.  Other than that I will try this again.

This recipe well deserves its high rating.  I added this recipe in March and have made it several times since then. 

Even though it is most excellent in its own right, a variation I really enjoy is to saute the chicken first and then the mushrooms, adding alfredo sauce and oregano to the mushrooms to pour over the chicken on a bed of linguine or spaghetti. 

Thanks for your great recipe.

I took a chance and made this recipe for company and it was excellent! My guests raved about it, saying it was better than going to a restaurant. I doubled the sauce as one reviewer suggested and it was just the right amount since it thickens up. There was only one brand of marsala at my grocery store, Private Selection at 2.99 and it worked perfectly. I didn't pound my chicken breast though, I just sliced them in half. I served it with angel hair pasta.

wow! This was really nice. have to make more of the sauce though, i couldn't get enough! I make something very similar using pork chops with wine instead of the sherry, with rosemary and parsley in the sauce. this is just as nice as the chicken one. i loved this though. thank you for posting, will become a regular meal.

Perfection! This recipe is superior to any restaurant chicken marsala I have ever had. It was easy and very tasty. My husband couldn't believe how tender the chicken was. I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent.  The only change I made was to add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it slightly.  Very easy to make and tastes great!

This recipe was great.  I made it twice in one week, the second time I added some redfish seasoning magic to give it a little kick.  I also added extra mushrooms. I love it both ways and am quite sure I will make it often.

I thought this was very yummy.... I think I will use a better marsala the next time. But I did have problems with the batter coming off when I turned the chicken.

I absolutely loved this!!! Once in the pan I added a little bit more oregano on each side of the chicken, and after just a little salt while serving to make the flavors kick up a notch. Will DEFINITELY do this one again!

Yuck. I've had a lot of Chicken Marsala, some good some bad.  This must have been the worst. While I don't like to drink wine, I ususally love to cook with it.  My husband said it was good.  He's just really sweet.

This chicken was soooo tender and tasted fantastic. It was really simple and fast. My whole family loved it. I followed one reviewer's suggestion to saute the mushrooms first. I will definitely make it again. Maybe several times a week.

This was good!  I added some 1/2 and 1/2 to make the sauce thicker, but that made the marsala taste less noticable.  Very good...  I also used Marsala wine vinegar and cooking sherry.  Next time I will use Marsala WINE.
Other than that, delicious!  I also doubled the sauce ( thank goodness! ), otherwise there would not have been enough.  Love it!

Excellent recipe - I filleted the chicken breast, cut it into small medallions and tossed it with penne pasta.  I definitely recommend the use of Wondra flour as opposed to all-purpose flour for this recipe.   Also, pounding the fillets before cooking is a step that absolutely should not be avoided.  It was quick - easy - and, according to my guests, just as good as any restaurant they've been to.

I would have given this an even lower rating but my guests were split on that decision so I counted in their votes.  When I prepared this I didn't have time to look at the helpful hints of the reviewers.  Wish I had - it does need some flavoring.  Like a bit of garlic.  I did use a very good quality Marsala wine and Sherry which I am grateful for - if I hadn't I wonder if there would have been any flavor at all.  Next time I feel like Chicken Marsala I will probably try another recipe.

This was delicious - the whole family raved!  I doubled the amount of mushrooms, added 1/2 cup chicken broth and didn't pound the chicken.  There was none left at the end of the meal unfortunately - that just means I get to make it again!  :-)

This was AWESOME!! Everyone loved it. I doubled the sauce and served it over angel hair. I also added about a cup of beef broth and thickened it with cornstarch. I sprinkled cut up sun dried tomatoes on top before serving. First I pressed the oil out of them and put them in a 350 oven for 10 min. they add texture and great flavor! This will be a regular at our house!

This recipe was excellent ... and so easy!!!  I used a package of 4 chicken cutlets so it made it that much easier, I also took the advice and used chicken stock instead of Sherry.  The only problem ... we both wanted more and it was all gone!!  I can't wait to make it again  =)  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely Delicious!!!  The chicken was so tender and tasty.  I doubled the mushrooms and the wine to serve over angel hair.  I will add flour and parmesan cheese to the mix next time. My boyfriend was impressed.  He asked if I could make it weekly!!!

Easy & quite tasty.  I used garlic salt to season the chicken and added about 1 tbsp. of flour to thicken the sauce.  A keeper!

This recipe is not only great tasting, and easy to make, it's kid friendly too!
I used a cooking marsala instead of wine, it was still wonderful, Can't wait to impress my friends with this dish.

I like the flavor of the chicken.  Chicken was moist eccept next time I will not cook the chicken in the sauce.  I would cook the seasoned chicken and take it out and cook the sauce sperately so the chicken wouldn't be so soaggy.

This was really a fantastic dish.  Usually, if we want chicken marsala, we have to drive about 1 hour to our favorite Italian place, and the prices make it impossible to enjoy it more often.  I am so pleased with the way this recipe turned out that I will definitely make it again and again!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it all the time.  I've read some of the reviews, and would admit that the sauce is kind of oily and not thick enough.  But all of that can be adjusted.  I always use Holland House Marsala and Cooking Sherry and the flavor is always great.  Make sure to use real butter. Thanks Lisa, this one is a keeper.

This was great!  When other reviews say the taste wasn't that great, they are wrong! I'm a marsala lover! Compared to the best you can get in a restaurant, this is right up there.  I served it to my stepbrother who is a trained chef from Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and he said it was excellent.  My only advice, is to use real butter.  When using margarine, the sauce is not as brown as it should be due to the fact that margarine doesn't brown.

The chicken really soaks up the wine well.  Some fresh garlic and extra oregano give it a bite.

Everything smelled delicious when I was cooking it, but it was disappointly bland. I used two types of mushrooms, doubled the sauce and used the best wines I could find. I'm not sure what this recipe needs but I will not make it again.

I just made this recipe and I thought it was great.  I did change it a little though.  I dipped the chicken in Egg Beaters prior to dredging it in flour.  To the flower mixture I added the salt & pepper, oregeno, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder.  I browned both sides of the chicken in olive oil and then just used the Marsala wine because I didn't have any sherry.  I also added a chicken boullion and a little flour to thicken the sauce.  I know it sounds like a lot of changes, but sometimes you have to doctor a recipe up a little!

This is the first time I've rated a recipe this low. The flavor was average, and the chicken itself was soggy. What's the point of browning it, if you're just gonna cover it up with liquid? I love cooking with wine, but this is not a favorite. Sorry.

This was a good recipe. My family liked it just fine but no rave reviews. Be sure to lightly brown both sides of the chicken before adding the liquid and mushrooms. I followed the recipe exactly and only browned the chicken on one side before adding the mushrooms and it was a bit mushy rather than golden brown. We will make this dish again but with the modification on browning the chicken.

I can't believe how easy this was.  No mess, not a lot of ingredients.  Personally, we like our foods "juicy" so I would double the liquid next time.  Very, very good....better than I have had in some restaurants.

My husband loved this!! He MMMMMed through the entire meal. He is already hinting at having this again one night soon. I served the Marsala on a bed of Linguine that I lightly seasoned with olive oil and oregano. It absorbed the marsala sauce nicly, very good.

So quick and easy!!!  To help with the bland taste, just add some fresh garlic.  A bit runny I found though.

I doubled the Marsala since I was out of sherry.  Everyone liked it but agreed that it was a bit bland.  Suggested adding a little more salt and perhaps sour cream just before serving.  I'll try that next time.  It is quite easy and a very attractive dish.

I thought that this dish had too much oil/butter...it was masking the "Marsala" part of Chicken Marsala!

This recipe was pretty good. It wasn't phenomenal but it was quite good.  Excellent with pasta. I have a feeling the chicken would have been better if it were like marinated in the wine + sherry. But it was quick and easy and cooked up quite nicely.

This is very good and easy.  It presents like you've been cooking all day.  The only trouble I have is sometimes the sauce is thinner then I like - maybe just not enough flour in the pan or maybe too much oil, but it always tastes the same - great!

This was a fabulous chicken marsala recipe.  I ran out of oregano but used basil and parsley instead, and added a little half and half at the end to thicken the sauce.  I did not find it to be bland at all like some of the other reviews said--it tasted great!  Definitely a keeper!

As mentioned in some other reviews, adding some heavy cream (about 1/4 cup) helped make the sauce thicker.  I also added 1 tsp. of basil to the chicken coating, which helped with those "it was bland" complaints.  Overall it came out fantastic.

A crave-worthy recipe, and so simple to make.  I look very impressive when I make this one, and always think longingly of it the next day.  It's especially scrumptious teamed up with garlicky mashed potatoes, with a bit of tarragon and thyme mixed in.  Tremendous.

This was pretty good- but I am still looking for a recipe that has a thicker sauce, like the one I had at "The Spaghetti Factory" Restaurant. Watch out if you use more Marsala than the recipe calls for... I accidently put in too much, and it was too overpowering. A little too much butter/oil in the recipe.

I think of myself as a decent cook and for some reason this didn't turn out as well as I was hoping or maybe it was because I have had the olive gardens to many times but all in all it was pretty good. Next time I will probably play with the recipie a little more and see if I can improve it.

This was a very good dish.  Even my brother, the pickiest of eaters loved it.  I would double the wine for extra sauce.  And cutting the butter and oil back to 1-2 tbsp seemed sufficient.  I have made it 3 times for all of my friends in the last week because I was so excited on how easy it was to make and how good it tasted.

Classic Chicken Marsala and piece of cake to make. Can't complain. Although, I left out the Sherry because I didn't have any on hand but it was still tasty.

This is really good.  I didnt have any sherry, so i just added extra marsala.  Delicious!  My husband loved it.  I added extra mushrooms, and simmering it covered reduced it to a very nice thick sauce.  Will definately make again.

The chicken tasted good.  I felt it was a little oily.  If I make it again I would use less oil and add more mushrooms.

This was pretty good and very easy. I did add some garlic powder for a little more flavor. Bought a medium priced Marsala and Sherry (both drinking not cooking quality) and was pleased with the results. Will add this to our recipe book.

awesome recipe! i added some garlic and used a sweet marsala wine and it turned out so yummy! it was super easy too...I didnt have Sherry so i used extra marsala and milk as others suggested. It wasnt enough sauce to use for pasta..so next time I will make sure to add more marsala and milk. Excellent :)

This is my stepson's favorite recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used water for the sherry because I didn't have any.  It turned out great.  It is a delicious recipe that is fancy enough for company, but easy enough to make any time.

This dish was delicious! To cut down on the carb count I did not use the flour which may have been why the sauce was not thick. I put seasonings in a shaker & sprinkled it on the chicken and followed the directions. I will definitely use this recipe over and over.

My sister gave me this recipe, and it has been a family favorite ever since. It's also really easy to make. We make this dish almost every week.

Really, really liked the recipe.  I did add garlic and next time would add shallots also.  I also used some half and half to enhance richness and thickness.  Served over linguine.  Next time would do some mashed potatoes.  I think the dish will work better that way.  All this being said, the chicken was cut with your fork tender, and the flavor was great!

I was initially hesitant to try this recipe because Chicken Marsala is one of my ALL TIME favorite dishes to order out but this recipe by far surpassed all of my expectations. I will definately be saving this in my favorites and making it again and again. My boyfriend hates chicken and he even loved it!!! Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us. Only thing I would agree with is to make sure you add more mushrooms. Otherwise, it's absolutely divine. I won't be ordering this our anymore!

Couldn't believe how simple and delicious this was!! So good! The only changes I made were to add extra mushrooms and a little more marsala wine since I didn't have any cooking sherry. I will definitely make this again!!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I really love the mushrooms as part of this dish, so I used between 3 and 4 cups instead of 1 cup.  They really cook up so when you add more, you still have plenty of mushrooms in the meal.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted excellent.  No need to add any additional spices or flavorings - it's great!  My husband is a very picky eater and rated this a 9 - a rare rating!  It couldn't be easier.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful!  I doubled the sauce as so many others suggested, but wished I hadn't.  There was so much liquid that I couldn't brown the chicken, and it was more like a soup with chicken breasts floating in it.  The flavor was fantastic though, so I will definitely make again, just not doubling the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Wonderful recipe; husband and I both loved it.  Like other reviewers, I added a bit more marsala and sherry and also sauted a garlic clove in the oil and butter; husband raved about the dish to friends.  Very easy to prepare, too.

Not bad, and pretty easy.  I think I overcooked the chicken a bit because it came out a lil dry, so be careful.  Also, I wish there was more sauce.

Excellent. Very easy, great flavor. Everyone liked it. I sprinkled poppy seeds and poured the remaining butter/wine sauce over the chicken before serving.

Good, but it didn't blow me away.  We never had chicken marsala before and if this is what it's supposed to taste/be like, then I doubt we'll ever order it at a restaurant.  Anyhow, just looking at the ingredients you can tell it would be bland with a very strong wine flavor.  I left out the sherry, used 1/2 1/2 sweet marsala and chicken broth.  I cooked bacon in some butter for more flavor and then finely processed the cooked bacon and threw it in the sauce.  No one could detect it and it thickened the sauce nicely and gave it a great flavor.  I also seasoned the sauce with blk pepper and added minced garlic prior to searing the chicken.  Served this over angel hair pasta and it was a decent meal.

Wow! This was excellent. I am not a huge chicken fan because I usually think it to be too dry but this recipe was tasty and moist. My ill boyfriend didn't want to eat, but once he tried this he asked for seconds. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Thanks!

Thank you!  I love chicken marsala, I have never attempted making it because it seemed too difficult until I read your recipe.  It came out wonderful (to my surprise)!  I did add a bit more seasoning along with some cream at the end. I have a new favorite recipe!!

This was by far one of the best chicken recipes I have tried!  We absolutely loved it and I will make it again.  The only thing I did was add some garlic to the the oil/butter before I browned the chiken (because I LOVE garlic).  Otherwise, it was perfect.  Can't wait to make it for a quick, easy, satisfying dish for company! Thanks for sharing!

The chicken was very juicy and tender, but like another reviewer said, it wasn't that flavorful. I may have used a few too many tblsp of olive oil, but the marsala/sherry flavor was minimal. I will try it again and adhere to the recipe more closely.

The chicken came out VERY juicy, however it didn't have a whole lot of taste.  I didn't add the sherry, because I typically don't like sherry, but I did everything else exact and I just didn't think it had much kick to it.  Next time, I will try some extra spices.

This was fantastic!  We added more mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, but otherwise loved the recipe as-is.

This was very easy to make and turned out amazing. Going by other suggestions, I put the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a resealable plastic bag, then added the pounded chicken. For more flavor When browning the chicken breasts, i added a few sliced cloves of garlic. I also doubled the sauce, and doubled the mushrooms

This was very good, or so I was told.  It didn't have the wonderful rich, red sauce that I'm used to having with it and that made it a 4 for me.  In fact, it didn't have much of a sauce at all.  I added more water to pull out some of the wine and juices and it turned out fine.  I also added more mushrooms, due to the fact that my family loves them.

The first time we had this it was just too oily.  The next time I halved the oil and butter and it was much better.  Thanks Lisa.

Not the very best Marsala but very good.  My marsala wine was not very sweet so I added about a tsp or two of sugar to sweeten it up.  Very yummy.

Very tender & juicy, but my husband & I didn't think it was anything special in regards to taste. I'll try the recipe on the Marsala wine bottle I think next time, then decide what spices make the best Chicken Marsala.

For some reason, I didn't scan the reviews again before i made this, so i did it just as directed. It was much too greasy - the sauce separated into mushroomy gunk and oil. I've ordered this dish in many restaurants and sometimes it has been great/other times miserable. This recipe fell in the middle... not a waste, but i'll keep searching for something better.

PERFECTO!!! I plan on making this dish when my in-laws come in from out of town. However, I changed it a little -- instead of cooking sherry I used sherry wine. This really brought out the flavor!

I really enjoyed this recipe and have made it twice so far.  My husband, who doesn't care for wine in recipes even had two helpings.  Thanks!

A favorite restaurant of mine made chicken marsala a bit differently from most places... I tried EVERY recipe I could find to get it right, and finally I found this.  Absolutely the best I've had.

Very good recipe!  I halved the butter and oil amounts with great results.  I also sautéed some crushed garlic in the butter while the chicken cooked shortly before adding the mushrooms and wine.  I used 3/4 cup red table wine, but next time I'll add more wine and mushrooms.

I doubled this recipe and served it over angel hair pasta.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  I thought it was just alright.  I would have prefered more sauce over pasta and I would have sprinkled parmesan cheese over it (I didn't have any on hand, though).

I could not believe how easy this was to make. The taste is exactly what I was hoping for, I added a few srpigs of fresh rosemary for zest. Even my 4 year old daughter who barely eats anything ate all of it.I'll definitley do this one again.

This was good though not exactly the chicken marsala that I remembered from childhood.  My husband really liked it though so I will make it again.  I think next time some diced, cooked tomatoes and a little parmesan cheese would be a nice addition.

I MADE THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVED IT. I USED WHITE DRINKING WINE INSTEAD OF MARSALA WINE AND DOUBLED THE MUSHROOMS. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE MADE THIS AND IT WAS SO EASY AND FAST. I ALSO ADDED ALITTLE CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. WILL DEFINITLEY MAKE AGAIN.

Incredible recipe!  I always "accidently" add an entire container of the sliced mushrooms.  After I remove the chicken, I mix a package of cooked angel hair pasta in with the remaining sauce.  That makes enough for leftovers the next day!

I made a few alterations for convenience.  I left out the sherry because I didn't have any and replaced the marsala with burgundy wine.  I also added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce a little.  It was great even like this!

This recipe is just delicious!  To the person who commented it was too sweet, make sure you use DRY Marsala the next time.... and please don't use cooking sherry!  Any cooking wine is the lowest quality vinted and has salt added (to keep the kitchen help from drinking it in the "old days")  Always use a good (inexpensive) table wine for cooking, too.  I also added lots more mushrooms!  Very good recipe, Lisa!  Thank you!

Delicious whether using Marsala or white wine!!
Both are good!
Kids like the taste, but mind tend to pick off the mushrooms.  Hey, more for me!!!
Easy and delicious enough for entertaining, too!

A wonderful recipe to make on rushed evenings or to impress company!  It's even better than buying it at a restaurant!  Thanks!

Good...not great.  Will definetely adjust recipe...add more mushrooms, more Marsala, and skip the flour altogether.

This receipe was not all it cracked up to be, very strong flavor, and it was much better cold.
Would make it once in a blue moon.

My husband said he would eat this every day!  I didn't pound the chicken flat and it was still moist and delicious.  Very easy too!  I added extra garlic and lots of mushrooms.  A definate keeper.

Awesome!!!  This is the best chicken marsala I have ever tasted and it was so easy to make I made linguini with butter and garlic powder and garlic salt and the two together were Awesome.Even my kid's loved it and there extreamly picky eaters. Thanks for this recipe.

Did't use the Marlala.. so I can't really speak on behalf of this recipe. Without Marsala wine it just tasted kinda funny.

I love chicken marsala and was eager to try this recipe. Although it was very good -- it didn't quite match up to my expectations. I was looking for a more intense sauce with a feel of creaminess to it. The 2nd time I made it, I let the sauce reduce much longer and added cream. That helped alot. However, the search continues.....

Absolutely delicious. We used all Sherry instead of the Marsala Wine (since we didn't have any, and it was great!  Made it twice in one week, we enjoyed it so much!

I was thoroughly disappointed in this.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  The chicken was very tender, but it was way too much butter and oil, leaving the sauce runny, no breading on the chicken, and hardly any flavor to the sauce.  I can't believe the rave reviews this recipe has received.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

This recipe was great!  I made it for company and everyone loved it.  I added a little bit of garlic powder to the flour mix and didn't use the olive oil.

This recipe was so easy and tasted great.  Nothing especially fancy, but very easy and very good.  I served this w/ rice and steamed vegatables and it was received very well.  I especially like the tarragon.  I will definately be making this again!

I loved this recipe.  I have tried others, but this one is by far the best.  There is enough sauce and the flavor is out of this world.

Pretty good.  I served it with pasta.  The only thing was, I will add some flour to the sauce the next time.  It was runny and would have been good a little thicker over the pasta.
