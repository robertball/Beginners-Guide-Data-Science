Phonetex - YOU ROCK!  I'm born and raised in Chicago but have relocated in the past 7 years and desperately miss my Chicago comfort foods.  I have not found "quality" hot giardiniera since I left home.  I've even resorted to having some Chicago style restaurants ship me their giardiniera but I honestly have to say that this recipe tops the best of the giardiniera I've ever tasted!  It's not drenched in oil the way they are and it's SUPER flavorful.  I'm not even through the 2-day waiting period and can't keep my head out of the bowl.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I cut the veggie's bigger (like back home) and doubled the olives (since that was always my favorite part of giardiniera.  I love hot food and this was perfectly spicy following the recipe.  I won't increase the heat in the next batch.  I wish I knew how long this particular recipe will last.  I canned it in several jars and hope this will help preserve it.  I will NEVER buy pre-made stuff again!  This is AWESOME!!! Thank you!  UPDATE: I just found this blurb from a site called foodsafety.com.  I guess unless you can eat this in 10 days...you're taking chances.

Can the Italian condiment, Giardiniera, be made at home?

Rating: 42

No. The Italian condiment, Giardiniera, CANNOT be made safely at home. This mixture of raw, hot peppers and vegetables in an oil base can support the growth of Clostridium botulinum. Therefore low-acid foods, such as vegetables, that are mixed with oil must be kept refrigerate

I didn't like the olive oil in this as it solidifies when refrigerated, next time I am going to just use water with the vinegar, any other suggestions?

This recipe is awesome!  My husband and I are avid spicy eaters, and I thought I would try a recipe like this.  The first time I made this (1 month ago) I made 20 servings and only have 1/2 a pint jar left!  I just finished draining the veggies again for another wonderful batch that serves 40.  When I first found this recipe, and read the reviews, someone mentioned about making more and giving them a "hot water bath", which I am assuming is for canning and storing.  I would like to do the same, but I don't know if the giardiniera has to be warm when I put it in jars for the hot water bath.  Can anyone help me?

An excellent recipe!  I can this recipe and as others mentioned, you should not use oil when canning, it acts as an insulator and may not kill any botulism cells present.  I skip the oil and after you drain and rinse the vegetables, bring 4 c. vinegar, the garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper and oregano to a boil.  Add the vegetables and olives and heat through until just about to boil.  Pack the vegetables and liquid in jars and process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.

Not bad if you want something to top a sausage or w/e the next day. However, this is not real (especially, Chicago style) giardiniera. Giardiniera uses serrano peppers (~ 1 lb. for this recipe size) with no green/red peppers (although you can add red for color). There is also no garlic, onions nor pimentos (other than maybe for color). Vinegar is often not used, but can be...but at a lower ratio than oil (I prefer olive over standardized canola)...and it's not mixed. Once you've combined the seasoning w/veggies and olives, place into jars, add a little vinegar if you want it, then top off with oil. Let is sit for a few days, and the flavor will rock your socks. The longer it sits, the better it tastes.

Wow is this stuff good! This is some of the best Giardiniera I have EVER had! It takes two days but boy is it worth the wait! I used almost everything out of my garden and I couldn't get over the flavor of this. I ended up making several quarts and canning it. I use it on tons of stuff or eat it right out of the jar. EXCELLENT! THIS STUFF ROCKS! THANKS PHONETEK!

fantastic!!! fantastic!! fantastic!!! I love being able to take advantage of the veggies I have on hand...sometimes I have more celery available, sometimes I have several types of peppers to use up...this recipe will allow to change up the ingredients as needed. Although I do have a question...in the event that this lasts in the house for more than a couple of days...does anyone know how long this will keep?

Excellent, versatile recipe! I made this only 24 hours ago and I've been snacking on it, already. I love giardiniera, but when I purchase the hot version in the supermarket, it doesn't always have enough of the veggies that I like. This recipe solves THAT problem! I like to eat giardiniera as a snack or serve as an appetizer, so I cut the veggies into bite-size chunks. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Next time I will add fresh, whole mushrooms. And, since this made a gallon size jar of veggies, I'm going to process some of this batch in jars in a hot water bath to preserve some for future snacking. Thank you, so much, for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I opted for 15 serrano chiles instead of the jalapenos because their smaller size(closer to the size of my diced veggies) and their a little hotter.  I also added a little more of each veggie than was called for.  I love spicy AND flavorful things and this is great.  Just the right amount of heat.  Enjoy

Heavenly. As a vegan treat for me, my sweet brother-in-law, Chaz the Chef, heated this for me in the microvave on a whole wheat bun, with a little of the juice soaked into the bun. No cheese, just hot vegetables on soft bread. mmmmm... Heaven on a bun...it's addictive.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I am forever done "buying" giardiniera.  Thanks to this delicious recipes.  I've already made my third batch in 3 weeks.  This is really really good.  I like that you can add different types of vegetables.  Thanks again.

This is a great recipe, it's just hard to wait 2-3 days before you can eat it.  You can adjust any of the amounts of veggies to suit your tastes.  I will try it with more hot peppers because I like it a little spicier.  The 50/50 ratio of vinegar and oil seems a little less oily than the giardiniera you usually find in the store, but it has a nice refreshing taste.  I usually just keep chopping chopping up more and more vegetables, and then mixing up as much of the "dressing" as it takes to cover everything.

Made a batch of this again for about the millionth time.  This time I figured I would add some broccoli along with the rest of the ingredients just to see how it turns out.  Left out the olives because I don't really care for that "briney" flavor to interfere with the fresh veggies.  Will report back in 2 days with the broccoli results, if I can keep my hands out of the bowl for that long...
-UPDATE- After the 2 days I tried the giardiniera which was great as always but the broccoli will get left out from now on.  The florets held too much vinegar in them and the flavor was just a bit too much.

My husband is a Chicago native and every time we go back to visit, we make a Bari's run to stock up on their medium and hot giardiniera.   When I needed a milder version for a dinner party, I used this recipe -- and we like it even better.   The big difference is that instead of running the jars through a canning process, I just stick them in the back of the fridge for up to six months.   As long as the vegetables are submerged in the briny oil, they stay crunchy, bright and beautiful.   For those of you who find the oil off-putting, consider this.   As we use the "fresh" giardiniera, I pour that yummy oil into another container and repurpose it as a fabulous secret ingredient in pizza/foccacia dough and Italian soups.   I also brush it on split rolls and toast them in the oven to elevate my Italian Beef sandwiches.   (The modifications I apply to this recipe are omitting the saltwater soak, adding a 12 oz jar of sliced pepperoncini/banana peppers, and substituting canola oil for olive oil.)

Not that this recipe needs another person to attest to how good it is, but I just had to leave a review! Grew up with homemade Italian Giardiniera and when my mom could not find her recipe, I used this one to satisfy a crazy pregnancy craving. I think it is better than my moms. Don't use any oil if you plan to can it, because of the risk of botulism, but you could always add oil once you open a sealed jar and keep it in the fridge. I don't think it will last long enough to see the inside of a sandwich!!

In order to home can this you can't water bath, you'd have to pressure can it since it's low acid.  Anyone have data otherwise.  Otherwise you could be setting yourself up for botulism, which is undetectable and fatal more than 50% of the time.

So this is now my second time making this wonderful recipe.  I still cut my veggies a bit larger for snacking.  The first time while marinating the olive oil separated completely and was hard to mix properly unless I sat it out for a bit.  This time instead of a simple wire whisk I actually blended the olive oil and vinegar together with a mixer, though a blender or immersion blender would work great. I also blended them first and THEN added that to the seasonings and olives, this kept all the pretty specks of color intact and there is very minimal separation of oil and vinegar/water. 24 hours to go and then it's ready...
It's ready and delicious.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was spectacular! It was worth the wait! The longer it sits the better it is. This IS Chicago Style as you can get. Plenty of places use jalepeno in their giardiniera in Chicago however I won't say names on the site. This recipe is designed for the masses, not the lower of the two percentages that like to burn holes in their guts so if you like it mild use less peppers, if you like it hotter use more or hotter peppers....it's not rocket science. I had to defend this persons recipe because the few gripes people are putting are nit picky and ridiculous. This is the ONLY recipe at this time on this site and until anyone finds better they need to quit complaining. Enough said.

This was pretty good. I made it for my Chicago born & raised husband & father in law who love this stuff topped on hot Italian beef sandwiches. It's not really what they top on Chicago beefs in Chicago, but close. My husband & I agree that to be authentic use Serrano chilis, not Jalapenos and don't use cauliflower. So I omitted the cauliflower and next time will use serrano chili. It also needs a tad of sweet. So I think I will use sweet cherry peppers next time too. All in all it was tasty and satisfied their craving for their Italian beefs. Makes a ton of it, so be warned!

I haven't tried this recipe yet but wanted to offer a suggestion to Daria Kilgore. (I had to rate it in order to post this suggestion and gave it 4 stars because olive oil will change texture when refrigerated)  


In place of the Olive Oil try Vegetable Oil for dishes you intend to refrigerate.  It won't solidify like Olive Oil does ... just one of the many little tips I learned from my Italian mother.  Hope that helps.

Most of it is awsome, but if it is supposed to be "italian" giardiniera it should have pepperoncini NOT jalapenos. Flavor was great once I made that switch, I too omited the oil as it just made it greasy. I made a tripple batch to can and just let the veggies cook while they were boiling to seal the jars. I strongly suggest the pepper replacment for authenticity but the rest was of the recepie was nice if not intended for canning and you like the oily feel.

I used half canola and olive oil. The vegetable got cooked when I pressure cook them to seal the jars. Not very crunchy but still the taste was wonderful! I will make it more spicier the next time. We gave some of them as a Christmas gift.

Excellent.  Searched for a recipe to use on my home-made Italian Beef sangwiches!  Loved it -just making my 2nd batch.  I did add a teaspoon of celery seed to the dressing spices.   Very versatile recipe to add in whatever vegis you have available, some zuchinni and summer  squash worked well.

Thank you for sharing!

I did this totally different. I don't like to rate something that I changed so much but some folks may want to try this version. I just took the veggies  without soaking them in salt and fried them in a little olive oil. Added 1 serrano pepper and 6 jalapenos. Didn't add all the oil, no vinegar and no olives. Like I said, I didn't make this as written and fried instead of pickled. Boy was it ever good on the Italian beef sandwiches from this site. Everyone was raving at my party! What great flavors!! I know this would be great made as is, but I wanted a healthier version and I didn't think too many people would have eaten it if I hadn't done it this way but what is so great about this website is the many ideas for a recipe you can get to make it the way you know you will like. Thanks for letting me share. Yummy!

Over 3 years I've probably made 30 gallons of this wonderful recipe,  experimenting with the liquids till I have a 50/50 mix of white vinegar and canola oil.  Had a garden this year with jalapenos and Serranos that made the best batches of all. I use a food processor for everything but the cauliflower,  incorporate it in a 5 gallon bucket and soak it overnight with about 1/2 pound salt.  I like how the quart Mason jars look with all the red,  green, yellow and orange colors.  Makes a great gift and the taste is far better than any store bought.  Thanks.

I used tarragon vinegar.  It's not as bitter and the only vinegar I use. It's a popular brand.

I made a huge 3 gallon batch and it only lasted two weeks.. so I am making more!  Only change is I used water instead of the oil because I am not fond of the oil/vinegar mixture.

This recipe is phenomenal.  I am from Chicago and like my Giardiniera HOT!  This recipe tastes so fresh that I eat it with a spoon.  I put it on top of everything.  Awesome!!!  I did not use cawliflower because I didn't have any.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Not quite hot enough for me so next time I will add all the hot pepper seeds. Thanks for the recipe

I made this a few years ago and it's amazing. Kind of like Italian dressing with big pieces of vegetables.  One note: if you use canola oil instead of olive oil it's less likely to solidify in the refrigerator. And oh yeah, it's great on just about everything.

Magnificent.  Stuck to the recipe, except  for the jalapenos  I removed the seeds from 2 and used only 6 total.  I thought is was a nice hot at that much jalapeño and many of my guests thought it was too spicy.  So, flavor was top notch, but my crowd would have preferred half the jalapeño.  Love this and will make it again.

Love this. Kept the pieces bite-sized because my hubby and I just snacked on it. Did not include red bell peppers because we did not have any and just added more cauliflower (my favorite). To prevent oil from solidifying as one reviewer mentioned, used half grapeseed oil and half olive oil…no worries about that. This is a MUST TRY! About to start my second batch.

I was really wanting some giardiniera and decided to try this recipe since it was so highly rated. I am well pleased with this recipe. I made some changes to the recipe to suit my taste. I omitted the cauliflower and green olives since I am not a fan of either and added an extra stalk of celery. I also used 6 serrano peppers in place of the jalapenos, but I think I might add more the next time I make it. I too couldn't wait the 2 days to eat it. A few hours after I had put it in the fridge, I decided to try it. I was hooked with the first bite! Much better than the stuff you get at the store. And it's healthy too!

This recipe is simply the best! Versatile and usable on nearly any dish, try a couple of heaping spoonfuls on bow tie pasta for a quick meal.  Visions of Nana with her gray bun pulled back, an apron covering her full breasts as she chopped and diced to create our giardiniera...the memories all come rushing back to me whenever I taste this fantastic recipe.

My husband and I LOVE this! We put this on everything: pizza, sandwiches, subs, cold pasta salad. I always wind up eating a couple vegetables before it's ready. It's delicious and you can add/delete the veggies as per your preference.

Wonderful!!  Since I discovered this recipe a month or so ago, I've made 3 batches and can't seem to live without it.  I cut the amount of salt down a bit and only put in 2 jalapeno peppers because I like the flavor but not so much heat but it's a great recipe.  I like to take it in my lunch, snack on it, have put it on homemade pizza, and am looking forward to making Italian beef for sandwiches to have it on... If only I could find Gonnella bread here in Indianapolis...

This is a great recipe. I added more olives (and also califower) like some of the other reviews had stated, because that's my favorite. I love to eat this alone as a side,or on pizza, hot beef sandwiches, pancakes...just kidding. A very good recipe!

This is the BEST!  I eat it for snack sometimes and when I don't have any on hand, I crave it!  I cut down on the olive oil.  I use a 1:2 ratio for EVOO:vinegar.

I don't think I've ever actually rated a recipe, but this is just too good to ignore. Absolutely class. I made it for the first barbecue of the year to have with sausages, but have since paired it with a cheese sandwich, an omelette, klobasa and today added some to my gobi aloo. Is that allowed? If I ate cornflakes I think I'd be adding a couple of spoonfuls to them as well.

Yummy!  I did modify it a little.  Used one large green and one large red pepper, 2 large serrano peppers thinly sliced instead of jalapenos, 2 celery, 3 carrots, 1 1/2 cups cauliflower, 3 large cloves garlic, 1 tsp Mexican oregano, 1 1/4 cups cider vinegar, 1/2 cup canola oil & 1/4 cup water.  Omitted the olives because husband doesn't like them.  Fabulous!

Made this for a bunch of full-blooded Italians from Chicago......They LOVED it! Added more cauliflower....that's the only change.  It is the best giardiniera I've ever had.

Great salad. Followed the recipe except subbed canola oil to prevent it from solidifying in the fridge. I also added a few black olives I needed to use up & a few spoons of pepperoncini. Next time I`ll brine in half the salt & use 1/3 of the oil but those are just personal preferences, the salad is great as is. Beautiful yummy salad.

I've never even heard of this stuff, but it looked healthy and I love anything with a spicy kick to it, and the reviews were so great. It definitely delivered! It didn't last a week. We were eating it on crackers as an appetizer, throwing some in our salads, making sandwiches with it & and little melted cheese. Fantastic.

ABSOULTELY WONDERFUL. I added some extra veg (asparagus, mushrooms) and can not stop eating it. It hasn't even been 12 hours and I'm afraid I may eat it all before the 48 hours are up. Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

This got a great response from everyone I served it to at a party. I cut my pieces of vegetable into bigger chunks instead of dicing. It was really pretty that way.  I forgot to buy the cauliflower, which really bummed me out, cause that is my favorite part. I cut back on the jalapenos because I worried about it being too spicy for the crowd I served. Next time I will put it the cauliflower...duh...and try it with more jalapeno.

Excellent!!  We hemorrhage through giardiniera....especially when I make Italian beef.  This recipe is fantastic...I opted to make 1 jar using diced veges and the other chopping (via processor) and making a "relish" which I use for pretty much anything from tuna salad to a bratwurst topping (I like the relish best).  Hubby thought that this was great because it contained all ingredients from the garden (aside from the vinegar and oil).  I used 11 jalapeno's and it wasn't overly hot...just the right bite.  Thank you so much Phonetek....I will use this often!!  10+ stars.

This stuff is the BEST!!  I have been eating it everyday with my lunch!  I just used it as a base recipe and added all my favorite veggies.  I like it hot, so I added extra red pepper flakes and some hot peppers that I had in my fridge.

I made it for the second time today--I am HOOKED on this recipe!! GREAT as a side dish OR on sandwiches--I especially like the cauliflower, and doubled up on it this time! I had to double up on the olive oil and vinegar to cover it... the vinegar and oil also makes an incredible salad dressing! Originally found this looking for a muffaletta recipe, and haven't even made that incredible sandwich yet! This is one fantastic recipe!!  THANKS, PHONETECK!

Soooooo delicious! Good on everything, I can't even bear to look at store-bought giardiniera! Optional to tone down the jalapenos to 6 or 4. Serrano chiles also work very well. Please note that they have the same hotness factor as jalapenos, so don't let the small size fool you.  I also added more cauliflower, as that is a favorite. Thank you PHONETEK!

Just had my first bite of this wonderful relish and I can hardly wait to have it as part of the Italian sandwiches for dinner tonight. This was easy to make and tastes just like angels kissing your lips.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the real Italian taste from Chicago or The Hill in St. Louis! I make 5 pounds of this at a time and it's gone in a week. Awesome!

This was DELICIOUS!  I made it exactly as stated, although I did half the recipe because I didn't need that much, then wished I had made the whole thing!  Delicious on everything or as a little side to a meal.  Great, great, will make this again and again!

[FIRST TIME:] I let it sit for most of a day before trying it for the first time... and now I can't stop eating it!!
[MANY MOONS LATER:] It's been forever since I made this the first time, and have been looking forward to having the time and workspace to do it again.  Reading another review and remembering my first batch, I did a little research.  Safflower oil ought not to solidify in the fridge.  I'll let you know in a few days.

Fantastic!! The only change I made was to use 5 jalapenos.  The peppers I had were very hot.  This makes a ton!! Husband really enjoyed it as did I.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Great Giardiniera recipe!  Excellent on sandwiches and salads.  Good with crackers or Italian bread as well.  It's eaten with a vengeance at my house and the fact that it's healthy is the icing on the cake.

This stuff is awesome, I toned down the heat a bit because my wife is from St Louis and doesn't do HEAT.  One of the other reviews said they thought it could not be canned successfully at home; but I'd differ.  There is more than enough salt and acid in this recipe to prevent botulinim from growing.  Other Giardiniera has less vinegar and probably wouldn't be safe but this one is acid.  Again thanks for posting.  I've been away from Chitown for too long.  Now if someone would just post a kickin Olive Salad recipe (i.e. Dominic's), life would be good.

This recipe is just awesome!!! I used 1/2 of the jalapenos, because I'm giving some away to sensitive pallets. I used soybean oil instead of olive on another reviewer's advice and viola!  It did not congeal in the fridge.

This was delicious. I had never heard of giardiniera before, but needed some for a recipe so I decided to make my own. I used what was left just for snacking and also on some ham sandwiches - it was awesome! It takes some work but I'd definitely make it again. I need to learn how to preserve as the batch was huge for just my husband and I.

My family loved this recipe.  Served with flank steak cooked in crookpot on sub rolls with cheese.  So good.  I only had three peppers, orange, red and yellow so I increased the amount of cauliflower and it turned out great.  My guys eat this on their sandwiches too.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! Not even 48 hours marinating and the heavens opened up and smiled upon me. This recipe is beyond fabulous! We added mushrooms and used 4 serrano's and 4 jalapeno's. If you like spicy use all serrano. Used 1 and 1/4 vinegar and 3/4 oil, will do 1 and 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 oil next time. Also added about 3 Tbs of pepperoncini juice. This is coming from a family who would never have considered any of these veggies in the raw. Try on whole wheat toasted Italian bread for a snack too.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow when it hits the 48 hour mark!

Whoa!  This is wonderful!  I cut my veggies a little larger and served it with still warm homemade pita chips and hummus.   I misread the recipe and added too much cauliflower so the juice didn't cover all the veggies but the flavor was amazing.  I just stirred it every day to marinate all of it.  I also added the juice from the olive jar.  I left the jalepenos in one piece, just slit them up the middle so my husband can eat them.  Can't wait to try it on a lettuce salad with salami.  YUM.  I am anxious to hear how they are after canning - it is so colorful it would make great gifts.

Wow, I made this to go on italian beef sandwiches, but I wasn't even sure I'd like it. What a pleasant surprise! It's a perfectly spicy, crunchy, fresh-tasting veggie topping that tastes exactly like what a good italian dressing would taste like if you could rehydrate all those little veggie flakes and eat it fresh! Amazing! I put it on italian beef, pasta, and all by itself, and it's all good. Right now I'm canning my leftovers.

I can't believe I made it through the past three days and finally got to taste this! It's indeed as great as everyone says! I used water instead of oil and I cut my veggies into big crudités-style chunks. The only issue is that they lost their crisp rigidity after the salt soak. I'd hoped it'd be restored after the vinegar soak, but it was not. However it wasn't a big deal and I wouldn't even have noticed had I cut smaller pieces as per the recipe. Update- If you do cauliflower in large chunks, like I just did, consider blanching them first. Otherwise they retain an unpleasing raw, almost rubbery texture.

An excellent recipe! I made this as directed. My husband who is from Chicago, said that this was far "more flavorful", than the giardiniera that you get from that famous place that sells it in his hometown.
We ate this with the Slow Cooker Italian Beef, another excellent recipe that is on this website

My son made this when he came to visit, and it was so good that it was gone in no time between my family and friends. I myself could not stop snacking on it with Italian bread, and on Chicago style Italian roast beef sandwiches. I had to make up another batch for myself. My husband just went out to get some more jalepenos, and he is going to do a batch leaving out the carrots, celery, and cauliflower , and using more of the hot peppers to make a super hot batch.

This is more a method than a recipe.  As someone else had said, this is a good way to clear out the veggie drawer.  I used carrot, red bell pepper, red fresno chiles, onion, cucumber, jalapenos, and some green onion.  My wife and I went through most of this in a week.  Very good.

Man this stuff is really good.... on just about everything. My favorite combo is to just use carrots, serrano peppers, and celery to mimic the traditional Chicago Italian Beef topping that my husband has gotten me hooked on.

Delicious! Just make sure to wear gloves when chopping jalapenos. It was my first time cutting peppers and my hands were left burning! Also make sure to wash the salt well off of the vegetables. The second time I made a batch I didn't. I also didn't add any oil so it would be diet friendly, and I can't see a reason you'd need to. Great healthy snack and awesome ontop of a pastrami sandwich.

Very Nice! Been nursing some sport pepper plants just to make a giardiniera in Dallas, TX.  Really hard to find the authentic flavor from chitown that I grew up with.  This is it!  We made short work of emptying the first jar.  Looking forward to picking the next batch of peppers so we can make some more!  Thank you!!!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! I can't believe how freak'in good this is!!! Made a batch to accompany Italian beef sandwiches (by Dick Pierce). Absolutely fantastic :) I followed PHONETEK's directions almost to a T, but had to improvise a bit.... The green bell peppers I purchased turned soft before I had a chance to prep them, so I omitted them alltogether, but upped the amount of celery & cauliflower. My bf said that I added too much cauliflower (oh well...)! I didn't think true giardiniera contained green bell peppers, but I looked at a jar at the grocery store, and, to my surprise, it does! I'll be sure to use them next time :) For a little fun, I used my PC crinkle cutter to cut the carrots. My only other change was to add a bit of olive juice to the EVOO/vinegar mix (maybe 2 T...). My guests were very impressed! I can't wait to sample this after it has "stewed" a bit longer. I served it a day premature due to lack of time to prepare it in advance as directed. I am going to add this to my "keeper" file. I am also going to share some (this makes a LOT) with my parents and my bf's parents. They'll love it! Thx. for sharing :)

This was really good.  The oil hardens in the fridge so I have to put some in a bowl and defrost it in the microwave in order to eat it.  Tastes really good though.  Made a good salad with it (green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and feta with a precooked chicken breast) and added some French vinaigrette.  Nice change to have a spicy, kicked up salad.

Made this Giardiniera yesterday and I've been practically eating it with a spoon!  I cut the recipe in half and made a few adjustments (no cauliflower, used a combo of Pinot Grigio Italian wine vinegar and Champagne vinegar to replace the plain white vinegar.)  Better than anything I've had from the grocery store, as good as anything I've had on a Chicago style Italian Beef (and yes, I'm from Chicago).  Now I'm wishing I hadn't cut the recipe in half, but I will be making this again.

Wonderful!!!  I really enjoyed making these peppers.  I ate them all by myself.
I will make these over and over again.
Thank you very much for posting.
I did make a change to suit my taste, I doubled maybe tripled the amount of peppers.  Thank you again.  RG

Here where I live they have discontinued Giardiniera and I have been on the computer trying to find where they sell it and so far nothing. I have decided to make it myself since when I go into a store and ask for it people look at me funny. Thank you for the recipe. I will definately make some up minus the peppers because my kids love this stuff also. Again thank you for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is wonderful.  I've made it at least 5 times, varying a little each time.  I sometimes add some hot pickled peppers and sub some of that pickle brine for the vinegar. We have been adding it to our tossed salad instead of salad dressing.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I have been using this gem of a recipe for 1 year now. I have also bottled it for my friends, nieghbors and co-workers as Christmas gifts. So far, everyone has loved it and keep asking for more. I have also substituded chiles/habaneros for jalapenos for an extra kick and added broccoli florets as well.

This is an excellent recipe.  We end up eating most of it before the second day!  The first time I made it however it was definitely HOT - I have found one to two jalapenos to be plenty.  It is excellent with pita chips.

LOVE this.   I'm a huge pickled/vinegar fan.   I can eat a jar of pickles in a sitting.   This satisfies my cravings, without all the salt that most pickles, etc., have.   I upped the vinegar by about 1/4 of a cup and added about 1/2 cup of water to help cover, but decreased the oil by 1/2 cup.   After making this, I don't mind the oil in it, but I'm not convinced that it adds a lot, so I will further decrease it to 1/4 cup the next time I make this.   I didn't dice, but prepared this as finger food.   Load up a bowl and eat this all by itself - yummy.   Thanks!

I was raised in Chicago and now live in Michigan...I have never found ANYTHING like the real thing and wasn't sure how to make it on my own until now.  Truth be told, I never tried...I just made sure to always have my Uncle make me a batch when we visited.  I came across this recipe while trying to find something to do with the surplus of summer peppers and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm in love!  I've made 5 batches since the first so my mom and I always have some on hand.  We use in on sandwiches, as salad dressing, on cottage cheese...and so on and so on ;-)  I always make my family something home made for Christmas...any guesses what this year's gift will be?

I loved this recipe!  I live overseas and have bothered packing a jar of the store bought stuff, but I'll never have to again!  I used a lot more cauliflower, celery, and carrots, and mixed poblano peppers with jalapeños.  I used less oil, and it turned out fantastic.  It was a hit at our family party.

Wow! Wow! Wow!  This is a must try recipe!  My husband and I are big on the city of Chicago and he says this is it!  I have steered clear of the giardiniera when we visit because I hate anything that touches vinegar!  I saw this recipe and decided to make it for my husband.  Like any cook I tasted my food before I served it...it was delicious!  I am sold!  I think the longer it marinates in the frig the better the results.  I soaked the veg on a Monday, performed the second step on Tuesday and I served it on Saturday!  I served it hot and cold!

Amazing!!! I too grew up in Chicago and this is one thing I always take back with me on visits. It does not last long.

Next time I will use serranos and a bit less vinegar. 

I am in heaven.

Excellent. It was gone in two days. Serrano peppers next time for more spice. I just threw everything into the food processor so in the end it was not as time consuming as expected.

Good stuff!  Used fresh oregano, skipped the olives and bell peppers.  Used banana peppers and added mini ears of corn.  I also omitted the olive oil as we never had it in any giardiniera before.  Even better than the store variety!

Ye gods but this stuff was wonderful!  We used in tri colored pasta salad - dh went nuts.  It was a tad salty, but we really watch our sodium intake.  I'll probably try reducing salt next time and/or not letting it sit in the salt solution for quite as long.  In any event, will definately make again.  TY so much for recipe.

I never heard of giardiniera before, but found this recipe while looking for a way to use up some veggies from a shower tray.  This was awesome!  I like it on a wrap with turkey pepperoni and provolone.

Oh wow !!  All I can say is I normally do not like pickled anything. Yet this recipe caught my eye and I thought I'd make it for family. Tried it. It just made my mouth so happy. I did however drop the jalapenos from the recipe.

The first time making this I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Everyone has their own vegetable preferences so I've since added a lot of extra variety there.  Cherry peppers, okra, cucumber and mushrooms are some of my favorite things to add.  And I only ever use canola oil, which doesn't solidify in the fridge the way olive oil does.

I add more cauliflower and carrots because everyone seems to pick them out to eat.  I also use less hot peppers.  Great chopped up on roast beef sandwiches.

this is THE BEST! I am so hooked on it!! The only change I made was that I used extra light olive oil for a lighter flavor and it is soooooo good! I'll never buy the store made stuff again!

Thank you SO much for this recipe! I stumbled upon some giardiniera in the grocery store and became addicted to it.  Then they discontinued it so now I'm making my own.  Great base for any marinated veggies.  Sometimes I do the veggies and just leave out the hot peppers and olives and it makes a lovely salad/relish to keep in the fridge when I'm not in the mood for hot or company has arrived that might not appreciate the heat.Thanks again!

Great recipe! I love the brining step.  I halved the vinegar and used jarred pepperoncini juice to make a cup.  What got me started was Joe Amorosini's video as a News7 Christmas special but one has to buy the recipe through an obscure process.  I say more cauliflower.  Pic of brining jug included.

So incredibly good. I'm also from Chicago, and although it's not Portillo's style, it's so good I stand around and eat this stuff with a spoon right in front of the refrigerator. I also only used about 3 hot peppers because I want to be able to enjoy it without crying.

LOVE IT so much we are eating it with chips!  I too have relocated from Chicago and finished the  last of the supply I brought with me.  Never thought of making it myself.  I substituted jalapeños with serrano peppers, and ended up using 3x the oil, vinegar and garlic.  1 c of oil and vinegar was not enough to cover the 4 bell peppers. I also used  canola oil instead of olive oil.  Thanks.

Double the batch, it evaporates once you present an open jar to your guests.  I wouldn't change a thing and I've made this five times in a three month period.  Family and friends are asking for this in lieu of jams for Christmas food gifts. LOVE IT...

I kinda like how it turned out. Not as much flavor or pickleyness as I would like. But it is interesting that the veggies don't need to be cooked and still come out like they've been blanched. With the oil in there, mine is not clear like the picture. Tweak time.

I used ghost peppers, red jalapeno peppers with seeds and habanero peppers. I didn't add red pepper seeds.  Vinegar cuts back on some of the hotness. I loved it but obviously not for everyone.

Delicious!  This first time I cut the ingredients fine because I was thinking of a relish.   I think I will try to squeeze in another this year and make it bigger pieces for an appetizer.  I also had no celery first time through and that's gonna change because I love celery.  I took out the seeds from the jalapeno peppers, and a week later it is nearly mellow.  All in all I love this stuff!

Great recipe. Lot of people raving about his on the first batch. 
 Doubled the olives first time and will try cutting the oil on the second try only to make it healthier.

This is really good.  I didn't really change a thing other than to seed my jalapenos as I didn't want this to be super spicy.  I have been eating this on nearly everything.  It's so good.

Incredibly good.  I upped the spice by using way too many serrano chili’s.  I find myself eating it right out of the jar by the spoonful!  This will be a regular staple at our house.

This was delicious!  I used more cauliflower and jalapeños but that’s the way we roll!  Tasted like the store bought brand that we’ve eaten for years.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Not bad, but it was lacking pepper.   Try using 3-4 tablespoons of flour to thicken it up.  Instead of water, use Sloe Gin.   Goes well over navy beans.  Try these modifications and I guarantee a FIVE STAR delight!  Enjoy!

When I make this again, and I will, I will use vegetable oil in place of the olive oil.

I am obsessed with pickling right now.  I added in a clove of garlic cut in half and a bay leaf to each jar.  I love this on Italian beef sandwiches!

If you are looking to can this, there is a very  similar recipe in the 31 st Edition of the Ball Blue Book to home canning.  You do have to  leave out the oil.

I made it following the recipe, plus one additional jalapeño.   My Italian husband loves it, says it's the best he's ever had.  He's had it on burgers, Italian subs, and just by itself.   Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I made an extra hot version with some of my own pepper hybrids. Turned out amazing and can't wait to have on an italian beef or some pizza.  
Celery, cauliflower, poblanos, jalapenos, ghostly penos, white bhut peppers,  my El Scorponero, red pepper, scotch bonnets, cow horns ect, Used cane and white wine vinegar instead of plain distilled.

This is wonderful, I made it according to the recipe but then added spices to the bottom of each jar before sealing.  There is a lot of discussion on whether it is safe to can this, the answer is yes, just do not add the oil.

Great basic recipe.  As stated, this recipe can (and should) be customized to your own tastes (and what ingredients you happen to have that day).  Mine is in the fridge right now "cooking" for the next two days.

Made it as a Christmas gift for my husband as I don’t like anything in this recipe but he LOVES them all. Followed the recipe exactly and it was a great hit. It made 2 quart jars and it will likely be gone in 2 days. Will make it again.

Very tasty... very fresh.. 
The mistake I made was emptying the entire 5.7oz bottle of olives with juice into the mixture. Should've drained the juice and maybe sliced the olives. 

The olive juice is too present/up front in my mixture. Truthfully, I don't mind that.. but its a bit overpowering considering the amount of vinegar. I'm pretty certain the flavors would have been more balanced without the olive juice.

I made this mixture specifically for homemade Italian beef sandwiches.. I was hoping to convert my wife and sons to the joy of the Italian Beef... I got one of three... kinda! LOL

This is delicious! I also added fresh halved mushrooms, and 1 inch pieces of fresh green beans and wax beans. All my vegetables were roughly chopped- so this could be a finger food snack.  I canned this in a hot water bath for 25 minutes for quarts leaving out the oil. I add oil to the mixture after I open up the canned quarts. This is hot but not TOO hot and the taste is awesome! I will definitely make this again next year when the garden is ready for harvest!

I asked my sister to make this one day when I knew she was looking for something fun to do. We both loved it, and since she and I have both made several batches. She makes this delicious giardiniera to give as gifts. She also puts it on quesadillas. I make it for my family. We put it on rice, pasta, and pizza, and my husband mixes it in sour cream to tone down the heat and likes it as a side dish with sausage. I also use it as an Italian-style salsa with chips. Yum!

Lordy,Lordy this is so good, my first attempt at it and the neighbors are asking for more! One change I made was to use Canola oil because it will not congeal and solidify like olive oil will. I have never tasted any better.

I loved this recipe though I did make a few changes based on our taste preferences. First, since I had thought the store giardiniera was way too salty, I made sure I rinsed mine very well after I took it out of the fridge. Next, I did use Canola oil as others suggested since I knew I would be keeping it in the fridge and olive oil solidifies in the fridge. Finally, I only put in three jalepenos, but even that was too spicy for my husband so I may put in even fewer next time--or make us separate batches. 
I took some to share with my son and daughter-in-law and they too loved it. I will be making this again--soon.

This is, quite frankly, one of the best!  I made the first batch exactly as written with the exception of a bit larger veggies.  For my personal preference, I wasn't crazy about the garlic.  My husband loved it!  Second batch, I left garlic out and added a bit more cauliflower and some hot banana peppers and used a blend of canola and olive oil.  It's really hard to stay out of the jar.  Thanks for a truly delicious recipe!

Nice. I replaced the cauliflower with thickly shredded cabbage. It gives it more stability than cauliflower floweretts  rolling off a sandwich. Better and easier  crunch than biting through a chunk of  cauliflower. I will likely add black olives next time also. Yum! I used canola oil.

I made this with a few change after reading reviews.  I used about 2 cups of cauliflower, 1 large red bell pepper, 1/2 onion, 2 carrots, 5 jalapinos  and 2 stalks of celery.  I soaked veggies with 1/4 cup of salt for a day.  Even after draining and rinsing veggies very well, there was still a very prevelent taste of salt.  I then used about 4 ounces of the olives and about 3/4 cup of distilled vinegar and canola oil, along with the oregano, red pepper flakes, pepper.  Overall it was very good.  While I don't love salt, next time I will decrease salt and maybe mix in some black olives too.

This is very good.  My husband can't eat spicy food anymore
(too many years of eating spicy food) so I eliminated the hot peppers and added other peppers and it still tasted good.

Makes a lot! My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  Great flavor.  I'll never be able to buy the jar stuff again.

FABULOUS.  Served this on Chef John's Chicago inspired italian hot beef sandwiches and it was great! My husband raved about it. I've also eaten by itself and with other meats/dishes and it's great! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made it exactly as is and it was less spicy than I thought. I do wonder about canning it as it made quite a bit and I put it in jars. The olive oil does solidify in the fridge but it still tastes fine. Made some great gifts.
so yummy on sandwiches

The olive oil solidified in the fridge. I read someone's review to use veggie oil instead of olive oil. I will try that next time. Otherwise very yummy. I added banana peppers too.

I love this recipe.  I'm Italian and have eaten this in different ways but never thought it could be so easy to make.  I did change it a bit, I didn't have green peppers so only used orange bell peppers, I don't like green olives so I omited them but added mushrooms.  I didn't have jalapeños but did have fresh red chili peppers (I didn't add seeds, concerned it would be too spicy).  I like a bit more vinegar flavour so I added 1/4 cup less olive oil and added 1/4 cup more white vinegar.  I also doubled the recipe, jarred  and put them in  hot water bath for 5 minutes so that it will keep.  So, so yummy...Thank you for sharing

We do a triple batch, jar it and keep it all winter. We used last jar 1 week before we make the next batch, I leave it in salt brine full 24 hrs before adding remainder of ingredients. Love results

This is the second time I've made this fantastic recipe, this time I used vinegar with 10% acidity purchased from a Polish deli.

As a Chicagoan this a staple in our refrigerator. But this recipe blows away any store bought brands and is perfect for items from the garden.

I made this for a BBQ we were hosting where we cooked up Italian Sausages. I prepared the recipe according to the directions (minus most of the hot peppers). I didn't want it to be too crunchy. So I cooked the relish in a saute pan for about 5 minutes prior to serving so it would soften just a bit.

Love this recipe!   I left out the cauliflower and carrots simply because I had none on hand.  I ended up with a wonderful accompaniment to go with my fried calamari & plan to serve it in the future with bean soup, salmon & many other things.

I really wanted this to work. I made as written and I felt that the cauliflower and the carrots were too tough and the celery was soggy. Next time I would par-cook the cauliflower and carrots. Since I invested so much produce I chopped up and put in a farro salad. It was okay.

I followed the recipe exactly but it didn't work for us.  The vinegar was overpowering and the olive oil does solidify.
