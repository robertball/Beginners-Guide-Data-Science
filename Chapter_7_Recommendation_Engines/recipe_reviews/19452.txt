This has become a favorite in our house! I have decreased the lemon jello to 3 Tablespoons and make it in a "no-roll" crust. It is great!

This passed the test - my husband thought it was excellent and blueberries are his favorite. One correction: check the amount of lemon gelatin called for on the printed recipe (differs greatly from correct amount)

My mom loved this pie.  It wasn't too tangy, and it chilled very well, not too hard, but not runny either.  I cut back on the blueberries or it wouldn't have fit in the pie shell.  My mom called and got the recipe from me to make it again, so I would recommend this only if you like lemon and have fresh blueberries on hand.  I don't really like lemon, so my 5 star rating is based on my mom's opinion of this pie (I made it for her).

This is everyone's new favorite summer pie!  People actually ask me to make this for their birthday present!  I like to use a homemade pre-baked pie crust and top with fresh whipped cream and lemon slices (or zest).  I have also used individual sized tart crusts for potlucks, and they were a hit!

This a fabulously easy and great-tasting way to enjoy fresh blueberries when they're in season.  Just be sure you buy the biggest prepared graham cracker crust you can find.  (I bought a 9" one, and had to heap up the filling a bit.)  The lemon flavored gelatin really seems to bring out the taste of the blueberries.  Two pints of dry blueberries measures out to be 4 cups of berries, as called for in the recipe.  Thank you, Mom71, for this outstanding pie recipe.

GREAT RECIPE! My husband absolutely loves this pie. It's now his favorite even over his mother's custard pie which has been his favorite for years. Just the right mixture of ingredients (graham, blueberries and cool whip!) for a great tasting and very easy blueberry dessert! Rather than garnish with whip cream when serving, I just put a thick layer of it right on top of the pie. YUM!

This pie is wonderful! When I tasted the glaze before I put it on the berries, I almost didn't make it.  It was very candy like in flavor and I was sure it would be awful...but I truste the many reviews and made it.  I put mine in a prepared cooki crust.  We love it!  Will make it over and over.

This pie was excellent!! My first attempt at making pie, and it was so easy and turned out great! I was afraid it would be too "lemony", but you couldn't taste any lemon over the sweet blueberry tase.

My go to recipe!  Just-like The Pie Plate's fresh blueberry pie.  For those of us who don't like cooked fruit.  I always make 2, so I can gift one as a thank you or special treat; or keep one for us when bringing this pie to a party.  I cut the sugar to 3/4th & added an extra 2 cups of fresh berries today.  I've made this with strawberries too.  Have also used other jello flavors when I'm out of lemon; lemon is the best but the others do fine in a pinch.

beautiful presentation.  had just picked the berries and wanted a recipe without baking in order to showcase them.  Very different than a baked pie, but delicious!

If you don't have time for a cobbler or crusted pie, (which are my favorites for berries) this is perfect for a refreshing pie. I would recommend making a homemade graham crust, which IMO, is far better. There is no comparison with the store bought with all the added junk they put in them. I pound each unopened pkg of crackers with my fist to break them up, then dump the entire pkg in my ancient 'Little Oscar' processor. It just takes a couple grinds and the crumbs are perfect.  I melt the butter in the microwave  in the pie plate, mix the crumbs and sugar in a bowl, then stir them into the melted butter, and press it down with my hand. (Yes, I lick me fingers afterwards.) You can bake or chill the crusts, but I always bake mine. Its so worth it in flavor to make your own. The blueberry filling holds together nicely, and slices clean. Take the pie out of the frig about 10 min. before serving, so the crust can be sliced easily.  I use real whipping cream, but you can top it with the faux chemical stuff if you wish.  The pie was gone in no time.

WOW. I've never written a review before, but this pie was so good that I had to write.  I use AllRecipes constantly & have enjoyed many good recipes, but this one blew my mind(and taste-buds) for several reasons:
1.  Simplicity: Very few ingredients, quick, not-too-messy assembly, and oh-so-easy
2. Calories: Not many tasty pie recipes are under 300 calories for 1/8 of a pie.
3. Flavor:  Rich as all-get-out--The graham cracker crust (I made mine homemade off the box of graham cracker crumbs) gave the blueberry/lemon-gelatin filling a very surprising and deliciously rich taste.
4. Beauty: Using fresh blueberries and not having a top crust made this pie so pretty.  Every blueberry could be seen in all its blueberry-glory.  Very pretty.  I would only say that the yellow of the lemon gelatin was a little scary-egg-yolk looking.  I wish it were clear rather than yellow, but you can't really blame the recipe for that.  I used freshly frozen blueberries and just defrosted them, so don't be afraid to do that. 

Great one, AllRecipes!

Very good.  Very pretty.  I used a crust of 1 cup flour, 1 stick of butter and 3T of sugar.   Mix till crumbly and pat into pie plate.  Bake at 375 for 12 minutes.   Cool.   Don't know how the graham cracker would be but this crust was still not soggy when we ate the leftover pie 2 days later.  The blueberries were still pretty too.

Make your own crust - lots of good recipes here on Allrecipe. This isn't really a traditional "blueberry pie." It's more like a fresh fruit tart. It's delicious, but some fresh whipped cream is really needed.

We love that even with the simplicity of this recipe it delivers great taste!  It's a perfect summer time treat since it preserves the berries in their natural state so well.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'm betting other berries could be successfully substituted as well for other taste sensations.

My husband, a blueberry pie fan, thought it was so-so.  My son thanked me for making "a brilliant pie."  I thought it was quite good, but not great.  Certainly an easy recipe, and I like that the berries remain fresh as opposed to cooked and mushy.  Since we have blueberries coming out our ears, I was pleased to have something tasty and easy to make.

This was great. It wasn't a traditional warm blueberry pie, but it was very refreshing for the summer. I was worried I got the proportions messed up. I used two Jello brand gelatin packets without measuring. It turned out not too sour and not too sweet!

Got some fresh blueberries and made this recipe. Decides I liked the idea of tartness so made my crust with processed lemon snaps. Lowered the lemon jello to two tablespoons.

This was ok for me and the hubbie. It's different not using a cooked blueberry. That being said I followed recipe and it made for a beautiful and light pie that is would be great for pot lucks over the summer. Won't probably make again unless for entertaining purposes but good overall.

This was amazing!  I made my own graham cracker crust - baked, but from there followed the recipe exactly.  Served it with whipped topping.  My guests and grand-kids just loved it.  I'm trying it again with peaches. Couldn't even taste the lemon jello.

We liked this recipe, and I will make it again as is but wanted to try it as a torte so I made a few changes.  I made my own graham cracker crust and used a 9x13" pan.  I used(one)3 oz sugar-free gelatin.  I added the blueberries right away and then poured the blueberry mixture on the crust.  After it cooled in the refrigerator, I mixed by hand two 3 oz packages of French Vanilla pudding with 3 cups of milk for about 3 minutes.  I  poured the pudding on the cooled blueberry mixture.  Then I mixed one package of Whipped Topping according to directions and put that on top of the pudding.  It is a richer dessert, but looks pretty and tastes very good.  It is now a torte and will go further.

I did not care for the taste or the texture.
