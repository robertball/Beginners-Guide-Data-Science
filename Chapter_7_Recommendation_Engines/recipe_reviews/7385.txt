i specialize in baking cheesecakes and this is an exquisite white cheesecake recipe and brought a $125 bid to a recent charity auction; however, I highly recommend a vanilla crust as I remove my cheesecakes from my springform pans to put on a cake board for serving. the sauce delicious (i was tipsy all afternoon after tasting the leftovers in the bowl) but not meant to be a hardened cover but rather a garnish. to make the cake more special, i piped medium sized dollops of sweetened fresh whipped cream around the top adding a fresh raspberry and mint sprig to each dollop; the final touch was a dusting of powdered sugar. humbly, i tell you, it was gorgeous.

AMAZING! I read through the recommendations and reviews for this recipe and it came out beautifully.  I added twice the amount of white chocolate to the cake (not the sauce), added a crushed oreo cookie crust (1/3 cup butter and 2/3 oreo cookie bag), and topped it with strawberries when serving.  The most important tip is not to put the springform inside the steam bath but instead to place the steam bath on the rack underneath the cheesecake when baking.

Of the 3 cheesecakes I've rated 5* so far, this is by far the easiest to make, and I think the best tasting too.  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't have a 10" springform, so I used a 7" and an 8".  The cake ended up a little thinner, but not by much.  (2 7" pans would have the same area as one 10" pan.  Sorry about the numbers... I majored in math in university and I can't help it.)

I wanted to transfer the cake to a platter for serving, so I added a standard chocolate cookie crumb crust (3/4c crumbs and 1/4c butter, pressed into pan and baked at 350 for 10 min) to make the transfer easier.  Also, I took everyone's advice and doubled up the white chocolate in the cheesecake batter.  Everything turned out wonderfully.  

But I'm not sure the cheesecake needed the extra chocolate.  That's because it's the white chocolate brandy sauce that really makes the cake pop.  To quote my wife, "you could pour the sauce on cardboard and it would taste great."  I'd stick with cheesecake though.

For baking, I put a pan of water on the rack under the springform pans.  The cheesecakes did crack a little, but I think it may be because I overbaked them slightly.

I also added a raspberry sauce (5 oz frozen raspberries, 1 tsp corn starch, 1/4c water, 1/2 tbsp sugar, boil 5 min, strain) for garnish, which I think was a good idea to add some colour to an otherwise very pale dessert.  I served the dessert plated and garnished each slice with a dollop of whipped cream and a raspberry.

This is an amazing recipe. There is one thing that I recommend and that is that you use a good quality white chocolate. The first time I made this I used chocolate from the bulk bin and it was an awful tasting cheesecake. I made it for Christmas this year with good quality white chocolate and took it to a family gathering. Everybody loved it and  wanted the recipe. It really was amazingly good. I had added an oreo cookie crust, about 20 oreo cookies crushed and pressed into the pan. They do not need sugar or butter and hold together nicely. I also changed the sauce and added about 3/4 cup Butter Ripple cream liquor instead of the brandy. It was phenomenal. When I served it, both the sauce and the cheesecake had been sitting in the frige and the sauce was nicely thickend. The recipe for the sauce made quite a large amount of sauce and I may try cutting that in half next time I make it. I sprinkled raspberries and blackberries on the cake to serve and it was a huge hit. I will be making this again and again.

Just finished eating it this morning, in fact.  I used a graham cracker crust pressed into the bottom of the pan.  It was delicious.  We didn't have any brandy on hand, so I used a shot of amaretto rum and it worked very well.  I would definitely make this again.   I don't remember if this was in the recipe, but cheesecakes taste better once they've set up overnight in the fridge.  Also, the sauce would probably be less runny if it is refrigerated, and then poured over the cake in the morning.  If I were to make it again, I would make it in the morning or a day in advance.

this was the easiest and best tasting cheesecake ive ever baked! so thrilled. i doubled the white chocolate, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. i made it in four 4.5" springform pans, and did have leftover batter. i used an oreo crust (16 oreos and 2 tbsp melted butter pressed into bottom of pants and put in freezer to set while making filling). i buttered the insides of the pans heavily to prevent cracking while cooling. i did fill a large pan with water and put it on the rack under the cheesecakes while cooking instead of the water back, bc thats easier. i cooked them until the centers were still slightly jiggly, and let them cool in the oven with the temp off and the door cracked for about 30 min before taking them out.

the cheesecakes were cooked perfectly. no cracks, not overdone, not underdone.

i skipped the sauce and used a chocolate sauce instead. (4.5oz of milk chocolate, 2tbsp dark corn syrup, 1/2 cup of whipping cream. mix together on low heat until chocolate is melted, drizzle over cakes.)

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made and it was a success. My husband had a holiday bakeoff at his work and the winner got a day off of work. It won! Since others had said the brandy sauce was really sweet, I used only one ounce of brandy and less white chocolate. I also added a rasberry ripple.

This was my first cheesecake.  It came out so good that my boyfriend thought I bought it. I crushed chocolate graham crackers for the base and added a couple more white chocolate squares for an extra chocolate taste.  It  came out great!

This is a wonderfully creamy dessert and bakes up so beautifully without all the cracks of a regular cheesecake.  I used an oreo cookie crust and got such rave reviews I actually have a lady that is going to pay me to make one for her next event!!  The only problem with the cake is that I expected the sauce to thicken more, but it remained very drippy.  As for the taste of the sauce -- yum yum.  I used a little less chocolate and brandy like the other reviewers suggested and it was very very good!!

This cheesecake was fabulous! It turned out really light and not too sweet as I had feared.  The brandy sauce on top came out a little too thin, however, so I added some more white chocolate bits.  I also replaced brandy with Tia Maria liquer and it went really well with the cheesecake itself.  Great recipe!!

No surprise, but this turned out wonderful. I doubled the chocolate, reduced the sugar. I did, however, add another ingredient... When adding the heavy cream and vanilla, I dissolved 1tsp instant coffee crystals in a teaspoon of water and added it also, making this a white chocolate mocha cheesecake... the flavor is out of this world. It gave just enough of a hint of coffee without taking away from the perfect flavor of the cake as it is. I'd strongly urge anyone else to try it. It was basically a starbucks latte in cheesecake form. [:

This was really easy and even if you don't have a springform pan you can put it in a pie tin with a grahm cracker crust and it's still amazing!

This is the best cheesecake I've made if not the best I've ever had. Like others have said, it will be raved about. That said, since the first time making I followed some of the recommendations to double the white chocolate and reduce the sugar (1/2 cup is fine).  I will add that though you can get away with white chocolate chips, it is neither as good nor can it be effectively melted like real white chocolate with cocoa butter.  I do a standard graham cracker crust, and other than the white chocolate sugar change, the ingredients are all the same. I also have a crappy springform pan so I generally put several containers (i.e. 8x8 or 13x9 pyrex) of water in the bottom of the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven to cool to reduce incidence of cracking. Worst case, it cracks and you can cover it up by refrigerating the brandy sauce to thicken it and pour it over the top.

Delicious! It has a hint of classic cheesecake tang and then is followed up by a deep rich white chocolate flavor. I doubled the chocolate in the cake, used half and half with a dollop of sour cream instead of heavy cream and made a raspberry sauce from this site instead of the brandy sauce. Also did a standard graham cracker crust and used a 9 inch pan. Don't set it in a water bath, put the bath under the cake then when it is almost done turn off the heat and open the over and let if finish for an hour or so. Let cool and room temp then chill.

It was okay, but not great.  The sauce ended up as the same color as the cheesecake.

I made this with sour cream instead of heavy cream (I had forgotten to buy the cream) and didn't make the sauce.  I used a 12oz bag of white chocolate chips, melting about 2/3 of it to blend into the cream cheese mixture, and stirring in the rest of the chips whole.  

I know that's a lot of modification, but I wanted to share. It was delicious!

I doubled the chocolate like other people suggested and it was fantastic. I didn't do the water bath I just put a 9x13 pan of boiling water on the rack directly under the cheesecake and it came out perfect. The only thing that I changed is that I only used 1 oz of brandy becauce it didn't need anymore and I added a gram cracker crust. Also, I couldn't find chopped white chocolate so I just chopped up some chocolate chips. When I told people that this was the first chesecake that I have ever made they couldn't believe it! It was so smooth and delicious that I coudn't even believe I made it!

I made this for my family and they loved it.  It is very rich and you only need a small slice.  The 10inch tin makes it a thinner cheesecake which works because of the richness of the cake.  I doubled the chocolate but next time I would only use 3 x 1 oz squares because of the richness. I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup. I left the cake in the oven to cool and didn't get any cracks. As advised by other reviewers I placed a water bath under the cake. The picture shows a dark chocolate sauce over the cake which is different to the recipe which uses white chocolate. I'm wondering if Judy meant to write  dark chocolate in her sauce recipe.  When I make it again I will use dark chocolate to see if the sauce is as good. As other reviewers advised I put the water bath under the cake.  Delicious!

I am still a beginner baker, and I found this cheesecake to be easy to make and it was delicious. I have become the hit of barbecues, and with my husband's friends (we're all 25) there is never any left.   I don't put the cheesecake pan in the water bath; I just put a pie dish of water on the rack underneath. I added a chocolate Oreo crust. I'm not sure if it's because of the altitude, but I usually end up baking mine for closer to an hour and forty minutes or so to get the center to set.  I add a white chocolate ganache and strawberries, usually, sometimes also with strawberry sauce.

This is one of my favorite cheesecakes:  SOOO easy to make and so delicious.  We served it on Easter Sunday and had an unexpected guest join us.  She declined dessert, citing that she was watching her carb intake.  But after watching everyone sighing in delight, she asked for a "teeny" slice.  And then another ... and another.  Then she picked up her plate and literally licked it clean!  (I'm not exaggerating!!!)  In truth, we all wanted to do the same ;-) I made it with double the white chocolate in the cheesecake batter but followed everything else exactly.  Some of the other suggestions (like raspberry ripple or chocolate crust) sound scrumptious but this cake was so already perfect, how can it get any better?  Baked it (bottom securely covered and up the sides in tinfoil) IN the water bath = no cracks and smooth as silk.  Tried it with the water bath on the rack below and it cracked.

Simple perfection.  I added an oreo cookie crust then added the full 6 ounce package of chocolate (reduce sugar to 1/2 cup).  Baked ABOVE a dish of water at 325 for almost a full hour until the center just jiggled.  Turned oven off, propped the door open with a damp towel for about an hour to let it "cool" before exposing it to room temperature air to cool completely.  Topped it with sweetened whipped cream (to which I added a dollop of sour cream and a splash of vanilla) and fresh raspberries.  Dusted with cocoa powder for the finishing touch.  GOrgeous presentation, perfect texture, abundant compliments. :)  To serve I drizzled with homemade raspberry sauce (from this site)and homemade chocolate sauce (1 c. whipping cream, 1 Tbsp butter, 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 2 Tbsp strong coffee) Insane wow...better than restaurant quality...and ANYbody could make this.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  What I don't get is that the photo shown here seems to be a dark chocolate sauce and some kind of whipped cream on the side with brandy in it maybe?  Please explain!

Also even though the cheesecake itself has turned out perfect everytime, my brandy sauce always seems to be thin and liquidy.  Any comments on that would be appreciated, since I will be making this a lot in the future!

This is now my go-to cheesecake recipe. No cracks, awesome texture and flavor. I did add the oreo crust but I think I'll try it next time as written, or use a lighter graham cracker crust. It definitely makes too much sauce as written.

First Prize winning cheesecake.  It is the creamiest cheesecake I have ever made and I have made many. My former recipe is being sold in restaurants. But this one tops it! Creamier and tastier with the white chocolate doubled as others have stated. I also baked a white chocolate hazelnut cookie crust for it. Amazing and beautiful. Cut the pieces small. It is quite rich!

This cheesecake is restaurant quality!  I did make a chocolate graham cracker crust by chopping up one package of chocolate graham crackers and melting 7 Tbls of butter.  Mix the 2 together and form it in the bottom of your spring form pan.  Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes.  I didn't make the brand sauce because we like fresh fruit on ours.  I just placed 3 raspberries on each piece.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

HUGE success. I didn't make the brandy sauce, just topped it with chopped strawberries. SO good. It was creamy, and delicate and just had a fantastic flavor. I did add around 6 or 7oz of white chocolate instead of the 4. I think next time I may even use more. I also made a graham cracker crust for the bottom. Will def make this one again.

Wow. Thank you for making me look like a star. I made this recipe with a graham cracker crumb crust (I just can't eat cheesecake without a crust), doubled the amount of white chocolate and for the topping I just made a simple ganache of heavy cream with good quality semi-sweet chocolate. Allowed all of this to set and then decorated the top with raspberries. Rave reviews. I'll definitely be making this again. Thank you!

This is an excellent recipe. I made this for a father's day family dinner and it won many family members' sincere approval. I did make a few alterations. First, i added an entire 11 ounce bag of high quality white chocolate chips (melted) to the cake batter. I also added 1/4 c of sour cream to make the cake a little lighter. Second, rather than using brandy, I substituted Johnny Walker Blue scotch---an excellent choice. I recommend letting the sauce sit in the fridge for at least three hours to thicken up a bit. This was a great recipe, and one that I would make again. Thanks Judy!

Even with some healthful substitutions, this cheesecake was absolutely amazing. I replaced 2 of the cream cheeses with neufchatel, 2 of the whole eggs with 2 egg whites each and 1/2 cup of the sugar with Splenda. Nobody guessed! It was as rich and silky as you'd expect from a bakery. I didn't make the sauce though; instead I covered the cake with chocolate ganache (10 ounces of dark chocolate, 1 cup whipping cream and a splash of sweet vermouth). Oh and I added a chocolate graham cracker crust. This is a definite keeper!

I wanted to make this because of the brandy but after i was done making the sauce before adding in the brandy, it taste so good that i didnt want to take a chance of ruining it with the brandy. It taste great. the cheesecake it self didnt seem to have much flavor but with the sauce was the best. gotta get more white chocalate into the cheesecake itself next time

oh this was soooo rich and delicious!  I doubled the amount of white chocolate in the cake and did make an Oreo crust (although it didn't need it).  I did not make the sauce because I wanted it to stay family friendly.  Additionally I ended up having to freeze the cake and it was still perfect after it had thawed out.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my husband's office party.  I used splenda and low fat cream cheese.  I made a chocolate cookie crust and raspberry sauce as a side.  I also had him take chocolate syrup as an alternative to the raspberry.  I did not try the brandy sauce as it was inappropriate for his office.  The cheesecake turned out perfect.  I will make it again for Christmas Day.

I've made this 3 times now.  I would give it more stars if I could!  I think the brandy sauce is a MUST.  We made it last time with coffee flavored liqueur instead of brandy and it was good, but not as good as the with the brandy.  We also line the top with freshly thin sliced strawberries and drizzle the brandy sauce over that and it comes out perfect every single time.

This is a fabulous recipe!  To make it more family freindly, i added the brandy to the cake then cooked out the alchole and felt it didn't need the added calories/chocolate with all that drizzle and was fabulous enough by itself!! Even used weight watchers cream cheese to make it lighter ;)  DELISH!!

best cheesecake ever.....  used graham cracker crust, added seedless raspberry preserves and then melted white choc and drizzled over the top along with heated raspberry preserves.  did not use water bath, placed water in bottom shelf like other reviews state and it did not crack at all....

The best white chocolate cheesecake (at least for my taste) that I have found.   It is the chocolate brandy sauce that puts it over the top.   Gives the white chocolate flavour some zing and also does not taste sickenly sweet.  Thanks   goes into my file forever.

Adding just another great review. Made tonight, cut recipe in half with an oreo crust - doubled the white chocolate - to DIE for. Served with Kahlua Whipped Cream but enjoyed the cheesecake best on it's own - a raspberry sauce would be great - no sugar added - just simple raspberry puree - boyfriend told me I should open my own cheesecake factory! EXCELLENT.

This was an excellent cheesecake recipe. It was super easy and tasted amazing. The only thing I'd notate is that the cake took much longer than an hour at room temperature and an hour in the fridge to set completely, but it was totally worth the wait! Thank you for the recipe.

I read a lot of the reviews before deciding on this cheesecake for Christmas dinner dessert, but opted to make it exactly as the recipe says for my first time making it. It was good, and I would make again in the future, but I did have some comments that the white chocolate was all but undetectable, and I think a graham crumb crust would be an improvement. Also, even though I baked in a water bath, and it came out of the oven nice and smooth and creamy looking, after about a half hour of sitting on the counter cooling, a huge crack developed in the middle. The crack got bigger and bigger while it was refrigerating overnight. I'm not sure why this is, but since there don't seem to be other reviews mentioning this, I'm sure it's not the fault of the recipe.

Wonderful crustless cheesecake!  In the cake,I used 12oz melted white chocolate chips melted in the nuker in a glass bowl (10seconds, stir, repeat until melted) and only 1/2 cup sugar.  Made sauce with dark chocolate chips. Served the sauce under and next to each slice. There was nothing left on the plates, cound not believe they were finger licked clean.  Many thanks for a great keeper!

This was the absolute best cheesecake I have ever had the honour of making. I used 9 squares (5 extra) of premium white chocolate, which I will do everytime. Due to the extra chocolate I cut the sugar to about 2/3 cup. I made a white chocolate ganache and drizzled each piece; serving it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a bit of chocolate drizzle on the side.

Excellent idea - the white chocolate that is.  It really takes a typical cheesecake over the edge.  I didn't make the brandy sauce so can't include that in my rating/comments.

This recipe was phenomenal.  I did the sauce warm, but then the next I had a piece and just used the sauce cold.  It thickened up really nicely.  I'm planning on trying using it as an icing drizzled over a spice cake done in a bunt pan.  Also I used a honey graham cracker crust which complemented the cheesecake really well without getting in the way.  I can't wait to share this with the family over a holiday!

I added a chocolate cookies crust and then made the cheesecake as the recipe states with the addition of a few extra ounces white chocolate. Instead of the brandy sauce I made a dark chocolate ganache with whipping cream, powered sugar etc. The next time I did it with strawberries on top- delicious both times!

Everyone loved this recipe! Came off perfect! Of course, we added more white chocolate. Used Hennessey Cognac brandy. Was about to buy a cheap bottle of brandy and was reminded that after it bakes, the alcohol burns off then you are left with cheap brandy! Never cook with alcohol you would not drink!

This was awesome!!!  It only lasted about 20 minutes on Christmas day.  My family gobbled it up and I didn't even make the brandy sauce!

This is my go-to recipe for cheesecake! If I don't want the white chocolate, I just omit it. Same with the sauce. I also use Golden Oreos for the crust. Just zip them thru the food processor and press into the pan. No need for butter or anything because the fat in the centers bind it together if you just press it in. Amazing recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe! I used raspberry flavoring in the ganache in place of the brandy but that's the only change I made.  Highly recommended!

Amazing! 2 things- I ommitted the flour, to make it gluten free, worked fine without it. I used 2x the white choc. & melted some to drizzle over the cake after cooled. It was picture perfect! I also baked it at 350, since I had a second cheesecake in the oven. I didn't get around to making the sauce, which I think would have added a lot to the flavor- it just needed that compliment.

This recipe was good and very easy to follow, although pretty time-consuming.  

A few reasons for the less-than-five rating ...  One is that even though I doubled the white chocolate in the cheesecake, people still couldn't taste it in the cake unless I told them it was there, so I figured next time, I'll leave it out and save a tiny bit of fat (there's lots more where that came from, and the white-choc flavor really comes from the sauce!) ...  

I added a graham-cracker crust (just butter, sugar, and crushed graham crackers), and that was a good add.  

The sauce was great, but I keep discovering I don't like alcohol in cooked food, just personal preference.  So I think next time, I'd make the same sauce but leave out the brandy -- not sure if it will turn out too thick, but at least my kids will be able to eat it!  (I refrigerated mine before serving, and it was not runny at all as compared to other reviewers.)  

Be careful not to overbeat the cake mixture, or you'll get bubbles.  I used the bath, and it was done very nicely.

This recipe was my first introduction to baking a cheesecake and was a huge hit.  It's now "the" requested dessert whenever we are invited out to dinner.  

It takes time but is not daunting and I bake the cheesecake over a bath of hot water which works very well.

Many thanks for an awesome recipe!

I am not a fan of cheesecake, but this one is something I could eat the whole pan of! It doesn't have that super dense feel to it and melts in your mouth! Topped with some fresh berries and drizzle some chocolate on top and it has become a favorite with my family and coworkers!!

If I could give this recipe a hundred stars I would. I've never made the sauce, but I can tell you the cheesecake alone is outstanding... the best I've ever made. I'm sure the sauce is wonderful too, but if you are ever in need of a great, easy, delicious cheesecake recipe, this is it.

Awesome cake - BIG hit with the family for Father's Day and my dad's birthday. SIL (professional chef) pronounced it "da BOMB" and everyone agreed. It was very easy and delicious, but I think next time it might get a crust of some kind. Thanks a bunch!!!

Absolutely one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made. I will be using this as a base for a lot if other cheesecakes. I did not use the sauce, but used the cake recipe to the letter when making my holiday cranberry cheesecake. I used butter cookies for the crust, and mixed in 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c chopped dried cranberries. Then I made this cheesecake, poured it on the crust. I dolloped four spoonsful of homemade cranberry sauce and swirled it in. Bake as directed. After it chilled, I drizzled more cranberry sauce over the top, then drizzled 2 squares of white chocolate on top of that. It looked like it came from the gourmet store!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I added double the white chocolate like other suggested. Make sure you use high quality white chocolate, it makes a huge difference when you're melting it. I couldn't stop licking the batter and everyone loved it. Combined it with a red velvet cake for red velvet white chocolate cheesecake layered.

What an delicious and EASY recipe this one! I went against the mass here and used less white chocolate on the topping, as I prefer it less sweet and it was still a success! I had requests for more!

I made this cheescake for my family and it was my first time making a cheesecake. I all ways thought it was hard to do, but with all the Tips that were given it came out great, so good that my family is wanting me to make another really soon. I used the wtaer bath idea, but I put a pan of water under the cheesecake and it was great.

Great cheesecake, I agree with the person before me, my sauce was not dark either, but I was thinking that limp on the side of this picture is the Sauce! I think next go round I will add 8 bars of white chocolate to boost the flavor inside the cheesecake itself! Made it with Oreo crust, pretty good!

I made this as a parting gift for company, and they were mad I didn't make it sooner so they could have more than one piece!  Just a note, I used white chocolate chips, and they worked fine... just remember if you're going to melt the white chocolate that goes in the cake using a microwave, like I did, either (a) heat up the heavy cream with it or (b) reduce the power on your microwave, because after less than 30 seconds I had BURNED chips.  I reduced my power to 5 AND heated with the cream to be safe after that, and was fine.  I took the advice of others and doubled the amount of white chocolate in the cake, and the flavor still wasn't overwhelming. I also halved the brandy sauce, and it made plenty... I might use slightly less brandy next time, too, because the sauce was a little alcohol-y for me.

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made, and it was amazing!  I made a graham cracker and hazelnut crust, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to sprinkle white chocolate chips over the bottom before adding the filling. Placing a pan of water under the cake did just the trick of keeping the environment inside the oven moist enough to prevent cracks in the cake, and chilling the cake overnight made it exceptionally easy to remove it from the spring form pan.  Instead of brandy, I used Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur for the sauce and chilled it (per another review) before spooning it over the chilled cake.  I made the leftover sauce available in case anyone wanted more, but in retrospect I should have drizzled the sauce over the cake instead of spooning or pouring it.  Thanks for the recipe and to all the reviewers for the tips.  I have to admit that I was pretty darn proud of myself when it was finished!

Great Recipe and so easy to make.  I made sure to cool the cake in the oven for at least 30 minutes to allow it to set.  I topped it with dark cherry topping and also used a graham cracker crust. It was delicious!

This was ok but everyone else seemed to like it.  I could taste the flour in the cheesecake though and thought it was odd to add flour.  I am pretty sure I mixed everything up right though.  My cheesecake did rise to a very nice height and I used a pan of water on the next rack instead of an actual water bath.  Had no cracks.  The brandy sauce was good before I added the brandy.  I think less brandy would taste much better but all I could taste was the alcohol after that and the white chocolate taste wasnt so apparent.

Wow!!  This was only the 2nd attempt at Cheesecake for me and am I glad I tried another recipe!  It was a little time consuming, but well worth it. I took it to Thanksgiving dinner and got nothing but rave reviews.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I omitted the Brandy.  Will definately make again!

I made this for a gathering this weekend.  My cheesecake obsessed friend informed me that it was one of the best cheesecakes he's ever had.  Though the white chocolate flavor was quite subtle, the cheesecake itself was delicious.  I didn't make the sauce, instead, I swirled some raspberry coulis I had leftover from another dessert into the cheesecake batter before baking.  I also made a shortbread crust.  But this recipe is fantastic.

I made this for the holidays and it was met with rave reviews.  I also added a vanilla wafer crust and about 1 cup of cinnamon chips right before pouring into the pan.  The sauce went well with the mocha cheesecake I made as well.

Delicious ! Perfect !  I increased the chocolate in the cake to 6 squares.  Baked it exactly like called for and it came out wonderful - no cracks and perfectly set.  I served the sauce drizzled over each piece - there is a ton on sauce left over.  Very very very good recipe.

I'm only 12 and this is the first time I ever made cheesecake!! I used lesser Polish products and it still came out perfectly, even though I had no help from anyone in making it. I didn't make the sauce and just served it with melted white chocolate and whipped cream- delicious! Also, I used more white chocolate in the recipe, and it tasted more white chocolate-y!

Excellent recipe. Works great with a graham cracker crust. I didn't have any brandy so I used Grand Marnier in the sauce, which is no doubt different, but is still excellent. The sauce winds up making *way* too much, of course: it calls for 3 cups of ingredients. You may want to cut it down. Of course, that sauce would be good on a whole lot of desserts.

The cheesecake was truly delicious but I had trouble with the baking time. I had to bake it for an addiional 20 minutes and it still didn't set entirely. It tastes very good though.

I found this cheesecake to be wonderfully moist and creamy.  But, I didn't like the sauce with the cheescake.  It makes it too sweet.  The addition of berries works for me, but ding the sauce.  When I make this cheesecake again, I will use a graham cracker crust.  I didn't like it as well without one.  Otherwise, the cake is wonderful. A keeper!

I used this recipe as a base to turn into white chocolate macadamia cheesecake and made a caramel to drizzle over. Make sure you cook cheesecake in water bath.....it's perfect!!!

this cheesecake is fantastic. i put a large pan full of water on the rack below rather than use a water bath. easier and just as effective. i had no cracks, bubbles, anything. it came out perfectly cooked. i made 4 mini cakes with it. instead of the brandy sauce, i made a chocolate sauce with semi sweet chips, dark corn syrup, and heavy cream. i drizzled that over the tops. oreo crust was a MUST. i used 2 rows of crushed oreos and 1/3 cup butter, pressed into bottom of pans, and put in the freezer while i made the filling.

follow the recipe to a T. perfect results every time. nothing but compliments. next time i am going to make it a peanut butter cheesecake by swapping PB for the white choc.

I tried this for the first time Friday after Thanksgiving! I wanted the combination of chocolate and the richness of cheesecake.  I love, love, love this recipe! Did I say love this recipe? My husband who isn't a fan of ANY chocolate loved it. He said it wasn't heavy with chocolate flavor. I didn't use the brandy sauce as I don't drink and having kids as taste testers, well you know how that is!  I did use a prepared crust and ended up with an overflow so I put the extra into tart pie shells. I used the water bath - for the 1st time and they came out yummiliscious!  I will use this with different candy - chocolate - milk, semisweet etc. I can't wait to see what else I can invent with this recipe! A definite on my dessert menu!!!

This is by far the best cheesecake that I've ever made, and it's so easy! After trying it, I doubled the amount of white chocolate. Also, after reading some of the reviews, I skipped the water bath, and it turned out just fine. I let it cool off in the oven completely to avoid any cracks and then let it sit in the refrigerator over night - absolutely scrumptious!

I baked this cheesecake for a Christmas dinner that my husband catered.  I didn't make the brandy sauce....he wanted a raspberry sauce instead.  Guests had a choice of three different cheesecakes and this was their favorite.

I love this recipe!  I modified it in several ways.

- Used four small Pyrex dishes to make individual cheesecakes, instead of a springform pan (I don't own one).  I filled the dishes pretty high - I probably could have made another one (possibly two).

- Lowered the baking temp to 275.

- Used 9 oz. white chocolate and only 1/2 cup sugar.

- Pressed crushed chocolate Oreos into the bottom of the dishes to create a crust.

- Skipped the sauce and made my own raspberry drizzle and raspberry sour cream whipped cream.


YUM!  So impressive.  I can't wait to make it again!

Made this for a holiday party. Followed all ingredients, just added an oreo crust. I didn't make the sauce but drizzled melted milk chocolate on top and added homemade whip cream piping all around. Looked gorgeous and was absolutely delicious!! Thank you! Maybe next I will try the sauce. :)

This recipe was delicious.  I did add a graham cracker crust, because I love crust with cheesecake. I used the reduced fat cream cheese.  The sauce is what made it a hit.  My brother in law told me to make sure I gave his wife the recipe for that "liquor sauce".  The picture is  obviously with dark chocolate sauce.

This is a very simple, excellent cheesecake. It was my very first one and I am very pleased with the way it turned out. I followed the recipe as it was and I agree with some of the other reviews and think there should at least 2 more ounces of the white chocolate.  I tasted it after I let it cool for about 7 hours and again after it had been chilling in the fridge and each way had its own flavor, so my advice is to try it both ways before you change the recipe!!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday. I don't like cheesecake but he said it was very good, as did his friends. I doubled the white chocolate as suggested in other reviews, but we found it still only tasted like a hint of white chocolate rather than a definite white chocolate cheesecake. I didn't make the sauce. I tried an oreo crust, prebaking it before putting the cheesecake mixture in, but it turned out very soggy. I think it might have been because springform pans tend to leak, if I try this again I will use a regular pan with a wax paper lining. I did put the cake IN the water bath, despite another reviewer suggesting putting it OVER the bath, as the point of the bath is to insulate the cheesecake from high heat and to control the rate at which heat gets to the cheesecake - if not done then the cheesecake will lose it's moisture. It had absolutely no cracks, but it did have quite a few bubbles which I couldn't seem to get rid of prior to baking. This was my first cheesecake, and though the crust was a major disappointment it was not part of the original recipe, so overall I think the recipe itself was very good but more of a white chocolate flavor and fewer bubbles would've made it perfect.

This is delicious.  The texture is wonderful, and I had no problems with cracking as I left it in the oven overnight after baking.  The sauce is very rich but very good, and I would also use it with other cheesecake recipes.

Yummy!!!  I have never heard of a crustless cheesecake so I put a graham cracker crust down, I wish I would have used Oreos like someone suggested because this with crushed oreos is GREAT!  Doubled the chocolate like advised and skipped the sauce, very easy and tasty THANKS!

I used the recipe for the actual cheesecake.  I followed the recipe including the fact that it did not have a crust.  I did not bake in a water bath, but rather baked with a water filled pan on the rack directly underneath my cheesecake as I saw someone else suggest.  It came out perfectly, even without a crust.  The bottom and edges baked enough to support the rest o f a cheesecake and I loved the crustless cheesecake because there was no graham crackers or oreo cookies to take away from the pureness of the cheesecake itself.  I chose to top with fresh sliced strawberries drizzled with a touch of white chocolate rather than the brandy sauce in this recipe.  I just personally am not a sauce person when it comes to my cheesecake.  It baked perfectly, no cracks, and a just right sweetness and creaminess.  It did turn out thin baked in the 10 inch pan, but it ended out perfect serving sizes for sharing among 16 co-workers.

I've never made a cheesecake prior to this recipe, and it's the only cheesecake I make! I made about seven of these over the Christmas season, some in 6" pans (I halved the recipe) and a few in 9" ones. Also, the sauce is AMAZING. My sister-in-law actually used the sauce as a creamer for her coffee! Haha! Love this soooo much!!!

I added a crust using 2 cups crushed honey graham crackers and probably half a stick of butter.  I used 6oz of white chocolate vs 4oz in the batter & instead of buying squares of chocolate I bought 2 bags of nestle white chocolate chips.  I have had bad luck with old bakers chocolate or maybe it was just a bad brand but I like nestles chips because they are already pretty small, however I still chopped them up for the sauce to assist in melting process.  I used the 2oz of brandy and sauce is very thin when warm and the brandy tastes stronger but if you refrigerate it overnight it thickens up and the brandy flavor is more subtle. I poured the sauce into an empty water bottle for storing and refrigerating. 

I forgot to make the crust before the batter somehow and didn't make the crust until about the time to add batter to the pan, then realized oops forgot the crust! so it sat in the bowl for a bit while I was looking at the measurements for the crust from another recipe.  Then accidentally looked at the WRONG recipe and poured the batter in without the vanilla and heavy cream and stuck it in the oven and sat down at the computer and realized I had looked at the wrong recipe, had to run back and pour it OUT of the pan and back into the bowl and mix in the last 2 ingredients and pour it back into the pan again! I thought I would have ruined it at this point but it STILL turned out delicious. 

I put the pan of water on the lower rack under the cheesecake.  And I cooked an extra

This turned out very well! It tasted fantastic. I took it to a Christmas party and it was gone in minutes! I took the suggestions of others and doubled the white chocolate. I also put a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake in the oven. I made a crust for this cheesecake: 1/2 cup each finely choppedd pecans, almonds, and walnuts, 1 1/2 cup finely chopped vanilla wafers, and 4 Tbsp melted butter. I also made the raspberry sauce that another user suggested, it was deicious. I will certainly make this again!!

I've made several cheesecakes before, and I think this is a good recipe for beginners.  
I didn't add as much white chocolate since I find it a bit too sweet (but only slightly less than the recipe recommends), and I made it with a graham cracker crust...it turned out beautifully.

I used 6 oz. of white chocolate in the cake & added a vanilla wafer crust. This didn't rise for me either & despite using the water bath (which I normally don't w/ my cheesecakes...I just put a pan of water on the bottom rack) it cracked. That being said....this is the best sauce. Yummm, yummm. I did halve the amount of white chocolate  & only used 1 jigger of brandy but it still had a stong brandy taste (which I liked). I topped the cheesecake w/ sugared raspberries after pouring on the sauce. It was pretty good. The next day I poured the sauce over a bowl of sugared raspberries & fell in love. It was better like that than w/ the cheesecake! I will use the sauce in soooo many ways.

I could not make the sauce because the cheesecake disappeared before I had even started...
maybe next time I'll try it with the crust too, just for a change and not to improve it...

I have made this cheesecake twice. Both times...everyone loved it! 
It is really easy to prepare. I made mine on a crushed Vanilla wafer/butter
crust. The brandy sauce is a nice touch, but is really sweet.
Everyone loves it!  Thanks for sharing.

One thing I like to do is substitute the white chocolate for Ghirardelli 60% cacao baking chocolate.  It makes a heavenly dense chocolate cheesecake.  Try it!

This cheesecake is freaking awesome! This was the first time I had made a cheesecake, and it could not have turned out better. I made a chocolate graham cracker crust for it and was also a little bit generous with brandy for the sauce. If I can make this cheese cake, anybody can.

This was my first cheesecake and it was a huge success. I had made it for my boyfriends birthday and we both loved it. I made a base from crushed arrowroot biscuits topped with some slivered almonds. I used another reviewers suggestion of baking the base by itself for 10min and then freezing it for a few minutes. Using this technique I didn't have to use any butter to hold the base together (therefore it had less calories). I had some trouble melting the white chocolate (even though I used good quality white chocolate chips). The method that worked best for me was to boil some water in a pot, place the chocolate into a mug and hold it right over the steam from the pot (mixing the whole time, of course).  I didn't have any brandy so I simply melted dark chocolate and spread it on the cheesecake. Then I sprinkled slivered almonds on top, and some sliced strawberries in the middle. I served it with dark-chocolate dipped strawberries and real whipped cream.. It not only tasted great but looked great as well!

This was my first real cheesecake and it it the best cheesecake I have ever tasted everyone was and is still ranting about it. I did cook it a little to long so when it was cooled I melted white chocolate and iced it then drizzled it with chocolate syrup instead of the brandy sauce I don't think it could have turned out any better!

Amazing! So easy to make as long as you follow the directions. I placed a roasting pan filled with 1" of water on a rack in the oven directly under the rack with the cheesecake. The cheesecake was still wobbly when I turned the oven off, and I left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour to slowly cool down. I then placed it in the fridge for about 6 hours before enjoying it. Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they ever had!

Very tasty cheesecake. Everyone raved about it.  I think I should've baked it just a bit more. It was a bit hard to cut. I wansn't a fan of the chocolate sauce but others definately were. I served it with raspberries on the side which was perfect.  I think a tart raspberry sauce would compliment the sweetness of the cake much better than an additional sweet sauce.  I'm going to try it in low-fat plus other chocolate versions (milk & dark) as well. I made a chocolate grahm cracker crust but think the cake deserves a richer base...maybe a brownie crust. Definately a keeper.

I love this recipe. Instead of graham cracker crumbs for the crust I use crushed Golden Oreos and top the cheesecake off with blueberries in a sweet, syrupy sauce. Fantastic!

This was very easy and super delicious.  It's the first Cheesecake I've made with a perfect top and crust.  I made it for a chocolate party Accidently, I used the full amount of the heavy cream and it came out fine.  I took from many of the reviews.  I made the crust from butter, sugar, graham crackers and hazelnuts. I lined the bottom(used a 9 inch cake pan) with dark chocolate and white chocolate chips.  I made white and dark choclate sauces (added frangelico to the dark sauce instead of brandy).  With some of the leftover I made mini muffin cheesecakes.  I was able to turn it out of the pan perfectly.

I did not make the brandy sauce so I can only rate the cheesecake. With that said, no one could tell there was white chocolate in this cheesecake. I think it does help with the creaminess of the recipe, but it was a little too sweet for me. Like other people I too added a graham cracker crust. Easy to make and good flavor, just not a "white chocolate flavor".

This cheescake was so awesome.  The only thing that took me offguard was the fact that the cheesecake was not very thick.  If anyone is used to "Chantal's Cheesecake recipe" on this site.  I would probably put it in a smaller springform pan.  The cooking time was perfect and the cheesecake was delicious.  I used 1.5 ounces of high quality brandy and I wouldn't change a thing about the sauce.  The picture is misleading as the sauce is definitely made with white chocolate and therefore is white.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I have had a lot of good cheesecake in my life.  This recipe was one of the best! The cheesecake melts in your mouth, it is sooo good. Only used 1 ounce of brandy for the topping, and left the cheesecake to bake in the oven another 10 minutes, because it didn't look ready after the time specified in the recipe.  Also added a grahm cracker base with melted butter and sugar just because I love the taste.  Came out perfect!

Sorry it took me so long to review this, but I made it for my husband's birthday (12/31) and it was FABULOUS!!  Absolutely just right for texture and weight.  I did add 3 extra blocks of the chocolate and it made the flavor out of this world.  Will definitely make this one again.

I recently made this, with a crushed Oreo cookie crust and made strawberry coulis to drizzle over the top.  A strawberry on the side, for presentation, finished it off.  It was outstanding.  The texture was perfect. My sister, who's a wicked cheesecake maker, said this one's the best she's ever had.

Very good.  I don't like crust so I really liked that aspect of this recipe.  It didn't stick at all either.  And the sauce makes a ton!  I think next time I would make it a little thicker.  I saw that someone mentioned adding more white chocolate to the cheesecake, too.  I made it according to the recipe and it wasn't very strong with the taste of white chocolate so if you like white chocolate I'd put a couple of extra squares in the mix.  And I bet it would be great with fresh raspberries!

I had never made a crustless cheesecake but this was relatively easy and turned out well.  This was very rich, even for cheesecake.  The texture was much smoother and creamier than other cheesecakes I have eaten.

I am a cheesecake novice but this recipe made me look great! For the cheesecake itself, I used a graham cracker crust and about 5-6 oz of Hershey's orange-white chocolate kisses (left over from Halloween) instead of the chips. I also used Hahn's "yogurt & cream cheese" just because it was on sale, but that seemed to work fine. In the sauce, I used grand marnier instead of brandy to compliment the orange in the cheesecake (used regular white chips for the sauce though). I also wanted a thicker sauce so I used about a half cup of  heavy cream along with about 1 3/4 cups of chips. Refrigerated overnight and got a nice thick sauce (consistency of hot fudge) that is great for drizzling on the cheesecake but will also be fabulous on fruit or ice cream. I will definitely make this again!

Yee gads, what an AMAZING cake!! i did however make a few changes to it. I added an oreo crumb crust, doubled the white chocolate that goes into the batter, lessened the sigar to 1/2 cup, and added a raspberry ripple. The sauce was a HUGE hit with my family. This is now my all time favorite cheescake recipe and I can't wait to have an excuse to make it again!!

First, I added a vanilla cookie crumb crust.  Put it in the freezer while making the filling.
 
Increased the white chocolate in the filling to 6 oz.  I added a raspberry ripple throughout the filling.  I may add even a bit more of the raspberry next time.
 
For the topping, I cut the cream and white choc in half, but kept the brandy at 1 1/2 oz.  (shot glass full)  I refrigerated the topping while the cake was chilling.  Poured it onto the cake after about 3 hours,and then let cake chill overnight.  Topped with fresh raspberries.
 
This was an amazingly good cake.

So delicious, but I made a few modifications based on other suggestions.  I made a graham cracker crust, mostly b/c I love it, and I increased the white chocolate in the batter to 6 oz.  I chose not to use the brandy sauce but garnished with whipped cream, raspberries and mint leaves.

does not taste very white chocolatey, but a good cheesecake nevertheless. it was more like a new york cheesecake with a hint of white chocolate. next time i might add more chocolate in and decrease the sugar to compensate. i used vanilla crumbs mixed with graham crumbs for the crust and it worked great. i omitted the brandy sauce altogether and topped with whipped cream instead. i also baked it at 325ºF for about 50 minutes and it turned out perfectly.

I only used the sauce for this recipe.  I added it to fresh blackberries and rasperries piled on vanilla bean ice cream with wafflecone wafer cookies lining the plate.  This was sooo good and I only wish it was a bit thicker for my purposes, however its consistency is made for this cheesecake.  Still very good and tastes awesome after multiple reheats!

THIS CHEESECAKE IS SO  CREAMY AND VELVETY; THE FLAVOR IS DEVINE!  I made these into miniature cheesecakes by following the baking time of a mini-cheesecake recipe found on this site and used crushed double chocolate oreos for the crust.  They disappear in a flash!

This was a very good cheesecake!  I'm 16 and a pretty good cook, but this was my first time cooking one of these.  It turned out perfect, no cracks and no guessing, just perfect!  

The sauce was excellent!  Here's a tip for everyone:  Make the sauce the night before, it thickens up perfectly!  

I made this for a family get together, and everyone loved it.  My grandpa thought it was good, he liked that it's not as cheesey tasting as a tradition cheesecake.  

I'd definitely make it again, I just need an occasion!

We loved it ! Just two changes: 1) more chocolate in the cake and less in the sauce
2) 70 min. cooking time. This could be because of altitude ?!
Wonderfully easy to make, and wonderfully delicious.

My friends were pretty impressed by it, but some complained that it was too sweet and smelled too cheesy. Also, this recipe says to bake till the center is just firm, but according to the cooking basics' advice, the center should still be wobbly. I followed the recipe's direction and ended up with little holes on the surface instead of cracks. Perhaps I should have shaken my pan before i put it into the oven to remove the air bubbles. Oh, oreos crust goes wonderfully with this cake.

I made it for new year's eve last year and everyone loved it. I made a strawberry sauce instead of brandy sauce but, everyone seemed to like it better with no sauce and couldn't believe it didn't have a crust! It was a hit all the way around.

This came out AMAZING. The only thing I changed after reading reviews is added 6oz instead of 4oz of white chocolate.  Everyone at the party said they absolutely loved it and it tasted store bought. 

The Brandy sauce thickens and has a perfect consistency for decorating if you put it in the refrigerator while the cheesecake is cooling also.

I have never made cheesecake before, but I thought I’d try to make some for my husband for his birthday since he LOVES cheesecake. He loved this recipe. So good. Used a graham cracker crust, and made a berry sauce minus the brandy since I didn’t have any on hand.

Love this cheesecake. Make sure to use real white chocolate, not the cheap stuff, check the ingredients for cocoa butter! It's easy to burn when melting, but makes all the difference. I make a crust of crushed chocolate sandwich cookies (no need to add butter, their fondant holds it together nicely) and usually top it with a dark chocolate ganache instead of the brandy sauce. I like the color contrast that way, and the bitter chocolate compliments the sweet cheesecake nicely.

Hadn't made cheesecake in a while and this was still easy enough to follow and everyone loved it (: I made six 4" cheesecakes instead of one 10" though and made a graham cracker crust (that got a little ruined with the first batch in the water bath :c] Putting it on the shelf below it worked just fine.

Also, only real complaint is the chocolate sauce recipe, it makes wayyy too much, I didn't even use half of it and it was drizzled all over those little cakes.

I found this cheesecake very bland. The brandy sauce was nice, but I think the cake needs passionfruit or berries to set it off. Couldn't taste chocolate at all. I was disappointed.

I've never had a cheesecake without a crust before. The taste/texture was a cross between a cheesecake and a regular flour cake. My husband who isn't fond of cheesecakes really loved it. Myself, I love cheesecakes so didn't really enjoy this as much.

This was one of the best and easiest cheesecakes I have ever made. The cake doesn't crack, which is really nice. The brandy sauce...a bit much on the quanity side. I'll make a gingerbread cake to finish it off, and have the sauce next time. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Incredible! Made it for our February Cooking Club get together and it was a big hit. I haven't had a crustless cheesecake before and thought about adding an oreo crust, but this cheesecake doesn't need it. Using the recommended 10" cheesecake pan makes for a very thin cheesecake, but that is all you need. This is the absolute richest, creamiest cheesecake I've ever had and the sauce just makes it better. I did double the white chocolate and it was delicious!!

This is the second cheesecake I have made and it was much better than the first.  I am a crust person so I made one with graham crackers, butter, & pecans.  I halved the sauce & it was absolutely fabulous.  This will now be my main cheesecake recipe.  And there were no cracks.  The presentation was absolutely wonderful!!!

WOW!!!  I made this for a party we went to...I should have made two!  It was marvelous.  Of course everyone adds their own touch...I made mine with a chocolate graham cracker & shortbread cookie crust & also I added 3/4 tsp. brandy & 1/4 tsp. vanilla to it, since I didn't make the sauce.  I didn't get much of the brandy flavor in the cheesecake, so I think next time I'll do a whole teaspoon.  Everyone at the party told me I should have made more & some were trying to convince me to make them one just for themselves!  It was yummy & went quick!

It the best cheesecake I"ve ever made. Left off the brandy sauce the first time and added raspberries and drizzled a chocholate sauce on top. It looked and tasted wonderful. I'm making it tonight with the brandy sauce.

Haven't made the cheesecake yet but did try the sauce for a fresh fruit salad -- it's a keeper!  The Brandy sauce is outstanding!

Very rich and very thick, I couldn't have but a few bites and I was done. Good for a quick sweet fix. I make it without the sauce and it tastes just fine.

This is the best cheesecake that I've had in a long time. I make two cakes and within an hour BOTH CAKES were gone! Great recipe!

Very good!  I made a vanilla wafer crust.  I have never melted white chocolate before...it melts quickly!!  It took me 3 tries to melt the 4 oz w/o burning it.  I finally heated it up on a medium flame for only a minute or so & then immediately took it off & beat the chocolate until it melted.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

This made a phenomenal cheesecake.  I used the strawberry sauce recipe and graham cracker crust to go with it and it came out beautifully.  I got many compliments and will definitely make again.
