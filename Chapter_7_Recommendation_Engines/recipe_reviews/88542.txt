This stuff is really good.  I didn't use the tomatoes and green chiles (instead used salsa...all I had on hand).  We had this rolled in fresh soft tortillas and had a feast.  I used pulled beef instead of ground which I know made a difference, but I will definately be making again.  Easy dip for parties and company. Thanks for the post.

Used salsa, Cuban seasoning, whole wheat macaroni, and it was creamy and tasty.

I made this the other night on my own not realizing this recipe was out there.  I added chopped green pepper and minced garlic.  Great dinner and awesome leftovers for lunch.

This was a big hit for a quick week night meal.  I used a shredded cheese, it's what I had in the fridge. Came out great!

My family loved this! Even my husband who is from Mexico! I used the mexican velvetta rather than plain and that added just the right amount of spice.

Needed something quick for dinner and ran across this recipe. I didn't have an onion or any corn on hand. And I used a can of diced tomatoes that were a "zesty chili" style with onion powder and green chiles in it. My boys loved it, especially with a big spoon full of sour cream on top.

8.29.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/88542/mexican-gump/ ... Homey, but good & very flexible.  I used rice instead of noodles, real cheese instead of processed.  'Sprinkled in some taco seasoning & added a half can refried beans.

Very good with some tweaks.  It is bland as written but perhaps those with less spicy taste would be ok with that.  I mixed in taco seasoning and cilantro and served with lime-flavored chips. I could definitely see using chorizo instead of ground beef.  As with many recipes from this site, one needs to gauge the audience and cater to those tastes.

This was just totally yummy!! Super quick and great for a busy weeknight dinner. I thought it would be fun to serve it with Doritos, they stand up to the dish just fine! Next time I would like to add some chorizo for some extra flavor.

I love this recipe, it's easy and the kids love it. Just a hint, to give it a little more flavor use the Mexican Velvetta instead of the plain.

We absolutely love this dish.  I added a little bit of Taco seasoning and used Mexican Velveeta instead of the plain and it added some zest to it.  I usually tripe the batch and take it to pot luck dinners.  It's always a hit.

This was a very quick and easy meal but it was sooo very very blah. No real flavor. My husband said it tasted like chili mac minus the flavor. If I were to ever make this again I would diffently add some seasoning packets to it.
