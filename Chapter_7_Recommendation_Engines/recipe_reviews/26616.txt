Delicious recipe!  As other reviewers have mentioned, the amount of sauce is very scant in proportion to the meatballs (this made about 50 one-inch meatballs).  If you're serving as an appetizer, I'm sure the single batch of sauce is fine.  But if you're serving as a meal and like enough sauce to flavor your rice as well, you'll definitely need to double the sauce recipe.  I did so (using 4 TBS cornstarch) and it made just the right amount.  I think I will increase the oven time for the meatballs to 20 mins next time since I believe they'll hold together a little better in the sauce if they're cooked just a tad longer in the oven first.  I added the pineapple chunks during the last 5 mins of simmering as suggested by another reviewer.  I'm sure this yummy sauce would work well with just about any kind of meat.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! :-)

This recipe was simple and easy to follow - the results were yummy too.  

However, the amount of sauce indicated isn't nearly enough to allow for a proper simmer, so you should probably make 1.5 times the amount or double it.  If you are in a hurry (or wish to confirm that the meatballs are thoroughly cooked), you can let the meatballs bake a little longer (additional 5 minutes), while you prepare the sauce.

FYI - The finished product will almost fill a 9" x 13" container (depending on the amount of the sauce).

Still the best sweet and sour meatball recipe ever! Need a fast dinner?  Use the sauce recipe with store bought meatballs and use frozen bell pepper slices. The sauce is great over chicken too.
HINT**Don't add any salt to the sauce until after you have added the soy sauce. It can make a big difference! I had never thought to cook meatballs in the oven before, this works great!

This is a family favourite at our house! I omit the carrot, green pepper, onion, and ginger, for personal preference, and use crushed pineapple. (my husband hates pineapple but likes it crushed in this recipe! lol) I half the recipe but make the full recipe for the sauce. I serve it over rice, I have made this several times and it always turns out great! Thanks Lana!

Outstanding! The meatballs were delicious.
VERY tasty...I cut the meatball recipe in half and used the same amount of sauce without cutting that part in half and it was just enough sauce. Would even double the sauce next time and still only use 1 lb. of ground beef. Hubby said he could eat these meatballs every night! 
I served it over brown rice and it was a hit! Great recipe. I can't say enough good about it!

Some of the best meatballs I have ever tasted. I doubled the recipe and made two batches, one for each party. Everyone loved the recipe so much at each party, I was told I need to make it for every family party. 

In addition - I have since made this for a family reunion. Other extended families came up to me and told me they KNEW these were not frozen meatballs from the store. I was referred to as the 'meatball girl' and they have begged me to share the recipe with them. I am telling you - this is a great recipe for meatballs!

When I was done making these meatballs, I transfered it to a crockpot and left it on low and it kept them nice and warm for the party. A must make.

The meatballs were one of the best I've made so far, hence the 5 star rating.  I enjoyed the sauce, but it was a tad too thick in my opinion.  I would reduce the cornstarch down to 2 tbls next time.  I added a dash of allspice to the meatball mixture and left out the carrots.  I'll definitely use this recipe again for the meatballs and serve them with spaghetti. Good recipe Lana.

This is an awesome recipe! I used premade meatballs which made it a little easier. I will add this to our family favorites. Quick and easy all the way!

I thought thises meatballs cooked up nicely, but the sauce was really sweet to me. Maybe next time I'll reduce the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and increase the vinegar just a bit to balance out the flavors. I also used about half the amount of bell pepper and pineapple and cut the chunks into tidbits. I served it over cooked fettucine. Overall, I would try this recipe again.

LOVED this dish! My only gripe is the same as others: too little sauce for the amount of meatballs. I made 3/4 the amount of meatballs (had 1.5lbs of beef) and made 1 1/2 the amount of sauce. Even with that change, I still think it would have done with a tad bit more sauce for serving over rice. Other than that, the resulting flavor of the meatballs and sauce are wonderfully perfect! Love the pineapple and bell peppers combo. I used both red & green bell peppers for more color and will do that again. I also baked the meatballs on parchment paper on a baking sheet for easy cleanup! This is a keeper! Thanks for the great recipe!

Eh. These were average at best. I guess I'm in the minority here as these seem to be a winner for most folks. I still stand true to MEMBER81872's sweet and sour meatballs. They were the first I ever tried (I stumbled upon the recipe in the Allrecipes cookbook I received ages ago) and are by far the best - EVER!!! :) Lana's MB's were mediocre in comparison. It just goes to show you that sometimes the overlooked recipes on here are the real gems (Member's recipe has only 24 reviews). I usually find myself tweaking new recipes, but didn't make any major changes this time. All I did was substitute a red bell pepper for the green one called for (happened to have one handy) and halve the MB portion. I don't consider either of these modifications drastic enough to significantly alter the recipe and they in no way swayed my rating.  I kept everything else as is and am glad I did. I had plenty of sauce to cover my MB's and veggies with. Served atop steamed white rice with Hawaiian rolls on the side, this was an allright meal. I'm glad to have given your recipe a try, but the vote at my house is no repeat (sorry!). Thanks anyways, Lana! :-)

Very Tasty...Both sweet and sour but not overpowering-just right. I did add 1/2 cup ketchup, fresh grated ginger and garlic to the meatball mixture. Used a real Hawaiian pineapple, cut up, with its natural juices. I also threw a medley of green, red, yellow and orange bell peppers for color and texture. I served this over hot rice. Thank you for this tasty recipe. We all enjoyed this flavorful dish!

I doubled the sauce and used less cornstarch (3 tbsp. total). I also added a couple of tbsp. of sriracha to the sauce to give the dish a little heat. Served it on rice. Delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I added more salt, regular salt, to the finished product to suit my taste.  Even though there were alot of ingredients, most of them were things that I already had on hand which made it even easier. I took this to a Christmas party and had none left.  They even scraped the last bits of pineapple from the pot.  I made them as the directions said, then put them in a crockpot which kept them warm.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I just made this for the first time, it is so good! I would recemend either cuting the ground beef down to 1 lb or double the sauce recipe, i made it with 2 lbs ground beef and 1 found i needed 3 eggs instead of 2,and i used Pastene Italian bread crumbs, the meatballs were to die for, don't omit anything, it is good as it is written.

This rating is for the sauce alone as I used frozen meatballs. I doubled the recipe except for the brown sugar (3/4 cup for a double recipe) and pineapple. I just used one 20 oz can of pineapple, all the juice (which was more than a cup) and water to equal the correct amount of liquid. This made enough for for 30 good sized meatballs. I used orange and red bell pepper, onion and sugar snap peas for the veggies. I don't like green bell pepper. My family rated it a "must have again" recipe. My out of town kids heard about it and also want the recipe. I'd like to try it next time with chunks of chicken or pork. Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty tasty. The smell of the meatballs when baking was amazing. We switched out ground beef for ground turkey.

This is now in the top 3 on my list of favorite recipes. It was so good, it'll make ya' want to slap your grandma! I only made half of the amount of meatballs, as I only had 1 lb. ground beef, but the sauce I kept as written. Omitted the bell peppers, I didn't have any. We ate this over a bed of rice. A keeper for sure!

My go to sauce for making sweet & sour chicken.  I have now made the meatballs and they are delicious too.  One of the few recipes I don't need to adjust.

Delicious and easy! I took the advise of others and doubled the sauce. Glad I did, it wouldn't have been enough to simmer the meatballs in otherwise.

This was a good and simple recipe.  I used premade meatballs. I chopped the peppers into smaller pieces and used crushed pineapple.  I also added garlic.  I was impressed with the flavor and how simple and pretty it looked.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow.  Made this tonight to bring to a potluck tomorrow and I'm gonna have to stop "sampling" or I won't have any to bring to the party.  I did make some additions - used fresh ginger and garlic in the meatballs and added another 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt.  In the sauce, I doubled everything except the cornstarch - just used 4 tablespoons because that seemed like the right thickness for me.  And, I added a cup of ketchup because I needed the sauce to be red and I like a tomato tang in all of my sauces.  It is perfection and I know they will be a hit tomorrow.  Also, I think I'm going to bake all of my meatballs from now on instead of pan frying - it's so easy and the meatballs stay round!

This was awesome.  The seasoning salt isn't necessary.  I used 36 frozen "homestyle" meatballs, and it was the perfect number for the amount of sauce.  Served over rice, and voila! This is soon to be laminated and placed in my permanent recipe box.

I really was leary of sweet and sour that didn't use tomato, but this one was fresh and tangy.  One time, I didn't have fresh green bell peppers, so I used canned roasted diced green chiles.  By mistake, I pulled out a can of the spicy kind.  It was actually fantastic and now party of my potluck rotation.

These tasted good over rice and the colors (pineapple, carrot and green pepper) were nice.  The kids liked them.  I will probably make this one again and put them in a crock pot for a work party or potluck.

This is a really good recipe.  My husband told me to toss the sweet and sour meatball recipe I was using previously and always make this one instead.  Thanks!

This was really good! I pan fried the meatballs which turned out great.  I also added more pineapple than called for, just because I like a bit of pineapple with every bite.

This one’s a winner!  Very good!  I used a mix of peppers (green, red, yellow and orange) and no carrot.  I steamed them, so they would maintain their vibrant color, until just crisp tender.  I prepared the sauce, omitting the ginger, as I’m not a fan, and reducing the brown sugar.  I added a cornstarch/water slurry to just thicken this slightly, as I hadn’t doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested and I wanted it to go as far as possible.  I added the meatballs, peppers and pineapple chunks, and just heated through.  Served over white rice, this was wonderful and very pretty!  I’ll make this one again!

Everyone loved this! I served over brown rice, with a salad on the side. I halved the meatball recipe and left the sauce amounts the same, which gave a good amount of sauce/meat. I also substituted quick cooking oats for the breadcrumbs and used honey in place of the granulated sugar. I accidentally left the meatballs in the oven for about 20 minutes, so they fully cooked after that step; therefore, I cooked the sauce with the veggies in it until the veggies were almost done and then added the cooked meatballs to the mix to simmer for 5 mins. Turned out great nonetheless!

I really liked this!  When I was making it I wasn't expecting to like it so well.  The sauce is great.  We had it over rice, and I would definitely serve the little meatballs and sauce as an appetizer.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these for a luncheon and everyone loved them!  Some said it was just a tad bit sweet while others thought it was just perfect; I think next time, I'll add less sugar, that way, if it isn't sweet enough, you can always add more.  I'm not sure if the recipe was written wrong, because I had more than 1 cup of reserved pineapple juice and recipe states something like add enough water with reserved juice to make 1 cup..anyway, I just added 1/2 cup and I didn't have brown sugar, so I just used white and left out bell pepper since I was out.  Also, I made the mistake of adding in the corn starch while the sauce was hot, so it became lumpy, you should mix water with the starch in a bowl, then add it in. Meatballs were great with the rice, this is a keeper. Thanks!

Soooo good! I loved it! I served it over fried rice, and doubled the sauce recipe, used a little serricha sauce, and red pepper flakes! It made it a little spiceier Which we love! I also used frozen meatballs, which made things so much easier! My husband didn't love it which sucks because I Did and would like to make it often, but won't be able to since my hubby didn't enjoy it that much:( but m opinion is it was great!!!( make sure u do make extra sauce;)

I was craving sweet and sour meatballs, and these gave me my fix.  After reading some other reviews I did make a few changes.  I only used two tablespoons of corn starch, and made half the meatballs to give me more sauce.  I did not have any brown sugar, so I used 1/4 cup of white sugar, as I heard many say it was too sweet with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It turned out just to my liking :)

This was fabulous!  I already had the meatball mixture made up so didn't use this one but wanted a great sauce for it... I tripled the recipe for the sauce (large family)... I couldn't really get past the lack of tomato flavor in it, so I added almost a 15 oz can of tomato sauce to the tripled mixture and it brought out the flavors in exactly the way I wanted.  Also I omitted the green pepper as I didn't have any on hand.  And I added grated fresh ginger to the sauce... probably a LOT more than called for, but we really like ginger.  Served w/ Japanese sticky rice... the family will be so happy tonight (it's still cooking!)...

Excellent!!!!  I made a half recipe of meatballs which made about 24 and baked in the oven for 15 minutes.  I used frozen peas and carrots instead of just carrots and I also used apple juice to top up the pineapple juice.  It all turned out wonderfully.  I loved it.  My 13 month old loved them but I couldn't get my 2.5 year old to even taste them but I think that has more to do with being 2ish and strong willed  than with the recipe!!  All in all I loved it and will make this recipe again.

Very, very sweet.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added some ketchup -- still too sweet.  I added red pepper flakes -- still too sweet.  I added mustard -- better, but still sweet.  It's pretty good, but I think next time I'll use the pineapple juice but not use the fruit and see if that helps.

Yum!  Thanks Lana.  I will make this one again & again.  I only suggest waiting until the last 5 minutes or so before adding the pineapple chunks, that should keep them from "shredding" and give them plenty of time to heat.

I loved that this recipe used things I already had in my pantry and it tasted so good! We only used 8 oz. of pineapple, and it needed a little more, but it was still very tasty. My husband wants to try it again, making it into a Hawaiian-style sub sandwich next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe- easy to make and delicious- my whole family loved it and are excited for leftovers tomorrow! Followed the sauce part closely (I never add all the salt, maybe 1/4 of what recipe recommends and I used regular salt, and probably only 2-3x the cornstarch). I did 4x the sauce as I had a lot of meatballs (probably double this recipe, homemade ones  in the freezer, Meatball Nirvana recipe from AR). I came home at lunch, quickly mixed up the sauce ingredients and poured them over the frozen meatballs in  a slow cooker, on medium heat for 4 -5 hours. Some meatballs mushed into meat sauce but most held their shape. I am sure storebought ones would hold up better, but these tasted better!! This will become my go-to sweet and sour recipe!

This was pretty nummy...and my kids liked it, too.
I used onion flakes in the meatballs instead of chopped onion.  A wee bit of cayenne, or red chile flakes would be good too...just to kick it up a teeeeny bit.  I browned the meatballs first in a bit of olive oil. For the sauce, I doubled the recipe, but cut the brown sugar in half and it was plenty sweet!  I also added a few more sliced carrots.  I then put the sauce and meatballs in my crockpot and left it for a couple of hours so we could be out at kids activities...and come home to a hot meal ready to go.  Served over rice.

This was a huge hit with the whole family- and for once, I didn't change anything! Actually, the only thing I did differently was to not cook the meatballs in the sauce. I found that 12min in the oven was perfect. It was so colourful and felt Hawaiin. The sweet-sour ratio was perfect. Definitely will be making this again, and would be proud to serve it to company :)

I halved the meatball mixture and followed the exact measurements on sauce mix and it turned out really good (I added red pepper flakes to spice it up a little).  I can't fathom following the recipe as stated, becauce the sauce mixture is not enough for that many meatballs.

My family loved this recipe.  It was SO GOOD!  I took another reviews suggested and doubled the sauce recipe. I did so (using 4 TBS cornstarch) and it made just the right amount. I think I will increase the oven time for the meatballs to 20 mins next time.  Another change I made and would do again is that I used a meat mix called "meatloaf mix" from the grocery store.  I think it was ground beef, pork and lamb.  Made the meatballs very tastey!  Will make in the future for sure!

These meatballs were great!  I really enjoyed the vegetables also, their texture remained somewhat firm and crunchy.  The next time, I plan to cut the carrots in slices instead of diced.  My fiance also loved this dish...a keeper!

Quite good except I had to double the sauce, and even then my husband said it could use more. I also halved the Vinegar as others suggested. My husband gave it a 7-8/10. I give it an 8 or 9.

I only used the sweet and sour sauce portion of this recipe. It was amazing!  I used red pepper instead of green due to personal preference. My husband was disappointed it was gone and wondered if we had the ingredients to make it again the next night. We're using this recipe for a party coming up. This was delicious and so easy!

I cut the beef in half like other suggestions. We like lots of sauce so I made 1 1/2 times what the recipe suggested for 2 lbs. of meat.  Was a good amount to coat everything and soak into the jasmine rice I served it on.  I used a red pepper cause we don't like green and added some onion.  Dice the carrots small so they cook through.  The meatballs were very tasty.  Loved the sauce.  Would use this sauce again maybe with pork or chicken too.

Very yummy!  I didn't have the time or ingredients for the meatballs - I used frozen.  But I used this recipe for the sauce and everyone loved it.

Very yummy! I made 3 batches and in the first batch I forgot the egg...oops. They still turned out great. I doubled the sauce and it was perfect. My husband took some to work for a potluck so we made them the night before. When he got to work he put them in the crock pot on low and they were perfect! We will definitely make them again!

I love this recipe. Make extra sauce though. Sometimes I move this to the crockpot after browning the meat if I have to make it early in the day and run errands.

I am reviewing the sauce only because I was in a major time crunch and had to use frozen turkey meatballs.  (I know, I know...)  I took them directly out of the freezer, browned them for maybe 5 minutes, and then added them to the sauce, simmering for 20 minutes just like the recipe states.  I did make about 1/3 more sauce than called for and it was much better sauce ratio, especially if serving over rice like I did.   This was easy and delicious.  Even my toddler shoveled it down.  I look forward to making the meatballs the next time I make this, and there definitely will be a next time!

Really very good. They're not kidding about the sauce being scant, though. This time I just added extra water before simmering the meatballs; will double it next time. Also I thought it was a little salty (and I'm not the sort to shy away from salt). Next time I'll cut back on the season salt and possibly the soy sauce. Will definitely be making again.

OH MY! This is wonderful and so full of flavor..it's actually hard to describe how good it is. I followed the recipe except where noted. In the meatballs I used 1 1/2 C  (dry) Stove Top Stuffing mix (chicken)... I mashed the dry stuffing a little smaller by putting it in a zip lock baggie and using a rolling pin over it a few times, then placed stuffing in a bowl with about 1/3 to 1/2 C of water, fluffed and let it soften, then added it to the meat mixture. When it came to the sugar..I was really leery of adding it but so glad I did. Don't worry it does not make the meatballs sweet like you might think. I made 25 meatballs and baked them for about 30 mins., turning 1/2 way thru. The sauce is out-of-this-world-crazy-good...I doubled it and added a small bag of frozen stir-fry veggies (that were 1/2 way cooked in micro.) and then poured all over the meatballs in a 5 quart crockpot and let simmer on low (about 2 hours or so) and the flavors blended beautifully. Served over medium grained rice this dish tastes like an up-scale restaurant meal. Fantastic! Thanks for this recipe Lana. :)

This was good.  The recipe as written works just fine.  Personally, the sweet and sour sauce with meatballs was just a little weird for me.  It tasted great, just not a combination I'm used to.  Great way to used up some ground beef though and the sauce was excellent.

This dish has a very good flavor. It reminded me a Japanese dish my mom used to make with deep fried pork.  Meat ball was a better idea and easier to make. Only the problem was not enough sauce.  I double the sauce by using grape fruits juice just because it was only available. I would have used orange juice. I am pretty sure it would have worked fine or even better? So, if you don't have any extra pineapple juice on hand, it is a little tip for you?  Since I made extra sauce, I added some onions and cooked with bell peppers and carrots.  Overall it' a very good recipe. Thank you for sharing.

This is very good.  I did throw in some ginger ale instead of the ground ginger and water, and threw in some ketchup as well.    Tangy! Definitely double the sauce.

Mmm, mmm, mmm!  I made these as an appetizer/side dish for my daughters birthday party, which had a hawaiian theme.  My guests LOVED 'em!  I doubled the recipie, using 4 lbs. of frozen meatballs I picked up at a restaraunt supply store.  It gave me two decent-sized trays to put out.  I omitted the carrot, but left everything else the same.  I made the sauce, then put in the green pepper, pineapple and meatballs and simmered it for about an hour waiting for people to arrive.  I skewered about 1/2 of them on toothpicks with a piece of pineapple or pepper.  Hope that helps any other party planners out there :)

I served these at a potluck dinner I threw a couple of weeks ago.  They were a big hit.  I had a number of requests for the recipe. I didn't make the meatballs in the recipe, I bought them.  I put them in the oven for 15 minutes while I made the sweet and sour sauce and then threw it all into a slow cooker to keep warm and keep cooking until my guests got there.  I didn't have any carrots on hand and used red and yellow peppers instead of green.  All in all a great recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

Outstanding!  The meatballs were delicious.  They were almost stand alone (without the sweet and sour).  Lana found the perfect combo of ingredients for meatball mixture.  2 pounds of hamburger perfect for mixture recipe, overkill for the sauce.  I took about 1/3 of mixture and put it in freezer.  Could tell it made too much.  The sauce/glaze was incredible.  Very tasty.  However, would not recommend directions for cooking of sauce.  Turn fire off, pour in juice/water mix, add rest of ingredients, then turn on fire.  Treat it like you were making gravy (whisk, heat, etc...).  If you cover it, do it only for a minute or so.  Other than that, Lana - I "lei" my head at your feet for an award winning recipe!

My husband said this meal was restaurant quality, but I thought it was lacking something, mostly because it was! I ran our of soy sauce and brown sugar so there was barely any in it. Both ingredients are really flavorful so I knew what I was missing, but he didn't. I also used ground chicken instead of ground beef. Trying to up the healthy quotent, but taking away some of the flavor I'm sure. Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly - and I'll be sure I've got enough of everything!

I doubled up the sauce, used premade meatballs and added quartered tomatoes (because I didn't have a carrot on hand) - EXCELLENT.  Much better than an old sweet & sour recipe I have used previously.

Great and easy recipe!!  I used frozen prepared meatballs, even easier.  The sauce was perfect, not too sweet or sour.  I will make this again, good as an appetizer or a main dish.  Thanks!

My 8 y/o son and I made this for our family dinner last p.m.  It was great!  I had all of the ingredients in the pantry and my son had a very good time helping measure and mix everything together.  We served it over brown rice and it was a hit!  Great recipe.  I can't say enough good about it!

This recipe is very quick and easy and most of the ingredients are things you will have on hand.  As there are only 2 of us, I had to cut the recipe in half and it was still marvelous.
Highly recommended!

This is so delicious! I made 33 large meatballs out of this recipe and filled an Anchor Hocking 9X13 glass dish. I doubled the liquid ingredients (all listed on the right-side from ingredients list above)and this turned out amazing. I also cooked it about 15 minutes longer since my meatballs were larger. Lastly, I used a whole fresh pineapple (I doubled) since they were on sale (only 1.99$) and I bought a container of pure pineapple juice. Hope you all enjoy this!

We've made this recipe so many times and it's excellent! I have made it as is and also several times with modifications. This does make a lot of meatballs so unless you plan on attending a party or freezing some of them, I would cut the recipe for the meatballs in half (I usually do this and still end up with ~30 meatballs!) but keep the sauce the same. In the past, I've substituted ground chicken for ground beef and it tasted great! I've also substituted ground oatmeal for the breadcrumbs. Since the breadcrumbs serve as a binder it doesn't really affect the overall taste of the recipe and it turns out a bit healthier too! The meal is a great both with and without veggies.

I use this recipe regularly for guests. I double the sauce and pour over the meatballs which have been cooked and fill my large crockpot with the added pineapple, green peppers and partially cooked carrots. Then turn on low and let sit for 3-4 hours. That way I can get the other details for dinner done. Rave reviews every time.
Not giving 5 stars because without a double on the sauce, there wouldn't be enough to put on the rice.

This was a good recipe. Very tasty sauce so  I did double it to put on our rice. I liked the carrots in the sauce. We could get some extra veggies into our diet this way.

This was so delicious! Made it for a family party recently and cooked it in the Crockpot. By the end of the evening there was nothing left. I'm wondering how well the sauce--which is as good as other people said it would be--would go with shredded beef? Have to give it a go! And I made it with meatballs from scratch. Very yummy.

Very good and easy to make.  I followed the directions the first time, but used turkey meat and the meat was a little bland but the sauce was great.  I figured it was probably me on the meat.  2nd time used TJ meatballs much better and the sauce is yummy!  Great to bring to a party!!!

Unbelievably good!  I used 3 lbs of ground beef (I have a large family) and doubled the incredible sauce recipe.  Perfect ratio.  EVERYONE loved it!  This will be a monthly menu item in our home for sure!  Thanks SO much!

Like other reviewers I tripled the sauce but halved the ground beef and then pan fried the meat balls. The sauce is FANTASTIC! This is almost exactly like the recipe my dad used to make and it is amazing! Thanks so much!

I cut the meatball recipe in half which made the perfect amount for 2 adults and a toddler and enough left overs for lunch the next day. I made sure the sauce was doubled but followed everything else to a T. This recipe was AMAZING! My husband who is an extremely picky eater and likes hardly anything LOVED this recipe and even went back for  SECONDS!! I will definitely be making this again and again and again!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome dish! I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for the sauce, even though I only had one can of pineapple. I just used all the juice and added enough water as recipe states. I also baked meatballs for about 20 minutes, heated with sauce for about 10 minutes, and left out carrot and bell pepper.

This was a fabulous recipe that many people raved over! As others suggested, I doubled the sauce recipe. As a quick meal idea I have also used the sauce with store boughten meatballs and the result has been great as well!

Very good and easy to make. I made a little extra sauce which it needs, otherwise it is just enough to glaze them. One thing I found was my diced carrot did not get as tender as I would think correct so either smaller dice or a quick parboil for the diced carrots.

Really good! I halved the meatball recipe and did a full sauce batch. Instead of stovetop cooking them,I baked them sauce and balls in the oven while my rice was in the rice pot. PERFECT!

Very easy to make and delicious!!! Wasn't too sure about having pineapple with my meatballs but it gave it just the right amount of sweetness. The only subsitution I made was I used lean turkey instead. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

YUMMY!!!!  Doubling up the sauce is a MUST if you plan on serving these over rice.  In the meatballs and sauce I used fresh ginger and I did replace some of the pineapple juice with chicken broth so my daughter wouldn't once again say it's too fruity (I don't think she cares much more for the fruit/meat combo)  Thanks for the great recipe Lana!

Quite good. I added about a cup of ketchup, cut the sugar in half, and added red pepper and onions. I had to more than double the sauce to make enough. It came out delicious!

The only thing I changed is I made half the amount of meatballs.  Husband really liked them. I think I would halve the amount of pineapple next time as I thought there was too much pineapple. Will make them again for sure though.

I did not want to bother to make meatballs, so I cooked the hamburg in a pot. I added onions, red, green and yellow peppers, mini carrots, mushrooms and fresh pineapple, garlic and the sauce ingredients. Cooked on top of the stove until vegetables were tender. Taste just like s&s meatballs without the fuss.

My family and I LOVE this recipe!  I use 1# of  turkey burger (1/2 the meatball recipe) and make the whole amount of sauce.  The sauce is delicious!  Served with brown rice and another vege. it's a good healthy meal!

The sauce is pretty good, but it just didn't go with the meatballs.  I think this would be a really good sauce for chicken.  The sauce definitley needs to be doubled.

This was very good. I used a little extra vinegar, cooked my meatballs in the oven an extra 5 minutes, skipped the "cover and cook until thickened" step of the sauce, reduced the cornstarch a bit, and added crushed red pepper flakes to taste. I thought I'd miss the garlic, but I didn't really notice a lack of garlic in the finished product. I do think in the future I'd use real ginger and not powdered, and I will sprinkle the herbs onto the meat before beginning the mixing (because I disliked having to stop and wash the meat off my hands mid-mixing) but otherwise, this is a very tasty recipe! Cooking times were spot on (I cooked my meatballs longer only because I made them a bit bigger!) Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it!

Yummy! I doubled the sauce recipe and used 4 pounds of frozen meatballs for a party! They were a big hit! Will be making this again for sure!

Wow! that was great. I've tried to make sweet and sour sauce before, and never really succeeded. My husband isn't a fan of ground beef, so next time I'll try it with chicken or pork. I followed the suggestion of others, and changed the ratio of sauce to meatballs. I made half the meatballs, and the same amount of sauce, and the proportions were perfect. Will definitely make this again!

This was fabulous!  I omitted the pineapple juice from the can and cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 Cup, and it was just right--not too sweet.  I made the amount of sauce shown, but only put in 15 meatballs.  This was enough to serve 3-4 people with plenty of sauce to cover the rice.  This is a keeper!

Great recipe! The only thing I had trouble with was the sauce...I thought it was too thick, so I added water until it was the consistancy I liked. I was trying to stretch this recipe to serve more people so I made the meatballs small and I did double the sauce. However I don't think it's necessary to double the sauce (like others have suggested) if you want the main attraction to be the meatballs. If it's sauce you want, then you will probably want to double it.

Halved the meatballs and made sauce per recipe, thus double the sauce.  Still made about 40 meatballs.  Loved it!

This was delicious! I doubled the sauce and skipped the green pepper and carrot. I served this over brown rice and it was wonderful. This will enter my recipe repertoire.

This is definately a keeper. I used frozen store bought meatballs (thawed) because time is usually a scant commodity in our house. I used only a pound of meatballs but made the sauce as the recipe stated and there was just the right amount. I agree with other reviewers, if you are going to use 2 lbs. of meat, double the sauce ingredients. Also, the recipe states to just add the cornstarch along with the other spices, I recommend stirring it into the 1/3 cup of water before adding; otherwise, it will clump all up.

I used this recipe for a company Christmas Party. I used a 6lb bag of Italian Style Meatballs and doubled all of the sauce ingredients but I didn't have green pepper. I used sweet red, orange and yellow bell peppers, extra ginger, extra soy sauce, and approximately one teaspoonful of onion powder and as the sauce was cooking, I added extra pineapple juice because the sauce got too thick. It had a beautiful, colorful appearance and traveled well in a crock pot. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

A fair amount of work, but really tasty - great for parties and large groups because it's still very good if it cools a bit.

Great recipe! I made a couple of changes: doubled the sauce (I like lots of sauce, especially with dishes that are served with rice) and used fresh ginger instead of ground. Very good.

This was awesome... One little change was that I added an extra TBSP of Vinegar and a bit of ketchup. This just adds an extra zip, with sweetness. I loved the recipe otherwise!

Really pretty good, but it didn't knock my socks off.  The meatballs do have good flavor and are easy to make.  They make a ton - I made the full recipe and served as an appetizer.  It made 70 small meatballs.  I doubled the sauce by using only one 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and then adding a 6oz can of pineapple juice to the reserved juice from the chunks.  I sauteed the bell pepper, carrot and a little onion to soften first.  Set that aside and made the sauce.  Make the sauce as instructed, but I mixed the 3 T. cornstarch with water before mixing it into the sauce so that it didn't clump up.  You do not need more than 3T. cornstarch even with doubling the juice unless you really want a thick sauce.  Once the sauce was thickened, about 10 minutes or less, I stirred in the sauteed veggies.  I put my meatballs, made with no changes, baked for 15 minutes in oven, into my slow cooker insert and poured the sauce over them.  Stirred in the pineapple chunks and set the slow cooker to "warm".  It was easy and could be made ahead. Oh...as one other reviewer suggested, I did not add the season salt to the sauce until tasting it.  Depending on how salty you like your food, you can omit the salt, since you have the soy sauce. I used about 1/4 tsp.

I liked this served over rice. I didn't use the seaoning salt, but instead combined garlic powder and sea salt (appx. 1 tsp of each...I'm a dumper) in the meatballs and the sauce mixture. This din't taste as good the following day though.

Great recipe! I made this meal for 6 adults. We probably could have fed one or two more people, it made a lot. My grandma and mother are not fond of meatballs but loved this! Sprinkle on some red pepper if you like some bite.

Absolutey delightful. My husband and I both do not like our meals to be super sweet, and we thought this had a great balance between sweet and sour. I did double the sauce as a lot of viewers had recommended, but I switched the green bell pepper for a red bell pepper and I chopped up an onion into the sauce too. This combo worked out great and there was plenty of sauce! I also added 1/2 tsp of cracked red pepper and 1/2 tsp black pepper into the sauce to give it a little kick! We loved this and I will definately be making it again.

These are amazing!!!  Sweet and tangy and a huge hit with my family - including my 2 year old!  I substituted ground turkey and omitted the green peppers (personal preference).  The result was simply delicious.  I'm adding this recipe to my regular meal rotation!

5+++ The meatballs and the sauce were delicious. I realized half way into making the sauce I didn't have any pineapple and didn't have time to go the the store. I therefore improvised...I watered down some lemon juice and amazingly it was extremely tasty.

Didn't add as much pinapple or peppers as the recipe called for.  I also didn't add carrots.  I don't like a whole lot of sauce so I liked this recipe.  The ginger really made this taste good.

not the best sweet and sour I've ever had.  Probably b/c I love vinegar sooooooo much and this just has a small amount of vinegar.  I like cider vinegar too, but I made this recipe just as called for.

Excellent recipe! Very adaptable one too. I made the recipe as written, but took other reviewers advice and TRIPLED the sauce, because our family loves their rice good and coated with sauce or gravy. Next time, and there will be a next time, I might add some chopped garlic, water chestnuts, and maybe some onion and mushrooms.I seen where another reviewer said this was good with chicken wings... I'll have to try that, maybe a slow cooker dinner in creation! Thanks Lana for a new (and easy) family favorite!

I made this recipe today and doubled the sweet & sour sauce recipe like some suggested. The sweet and sour sauce was soooooooooo tasty and we love  the meatballs too. I made my meatballs out of ground turkey meat and served it over jasimine rice. This is staying in my favorite recipe box!


Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I thought this recipe was really easy and quick to make, and tasted great as well. One suggestion I would make is to add less ground ginger: 3 tbsp is  a bit too strong for my taste, it left a kind of spicy, weird after taste.

Very good!! Was my first try at sweet and sour meatballs and they insantly reminded me of my Grandmas!! I prefer mine a little more tangy but they were still delicious. Some other reviewers have said these were either too sweet or not enough sauce, but I would have to disagree. The sweetness was definetly not overpowering and I had plently of sauce to cover the rice with. I cooked mine in the slow cooker which I added in one green and red pepper sliced thinly and 2 carrots sliced into discs, served over brown rice. Boyfriend couldn't get enough!!

DOUBLE THE SAUCE! These were good. The meatballs themselves didn't have much flavor but the sauce made up for it.  I see no point in using the carrots..it was a waste of of my time to chop them. I made the mistake of buying crushed pineapples after reading a review...never again, the whole ones (which I ended up adding) added so much more color and flavor.  I made these for a potluck and threw them in the crockpot, after a while, there wasn't much left for sauce and I had to make another batch of sauce to add to it which worked. Save yourself the trouble and double the sauce initially.  There was nothing left to take home.

They were O.K. The sauce was great, so were the pineapple & peppers. BUT, the meatballs were a little strange. It didn't seem right to bite into something sweet & sour and have it taste like ground beef. I think if it were a ground pork/beef combo I would have liked it better.

This was very good.  It made a substantial amount of meatball and the sauce was very "sweet and sour".  I used rice vinegar and substituted about 1/3 ground chicken for the beef.  I added parsley and pinon nuts to the meatball mixture and used panko for the bread crumbs and added a touch of fresh ground ginger.  To the sauce I chopped up fine, one roasted bell pepper for color.  Everyone loved it and said they would eat it again.  I served with with a red leaf salad with scallions, sesame seeds, grated carrot and a ginger dressing.  Tasty!!

Made for a party and everyone loved them. I used 3 lbs of 93% meat(less shrinkage), which made 90 cocktail meatballs and doubled the sauce.  I added garlic powder to the meat,ketchup to the sauce, no green peppers and I cut the pineapple chunks in half, so not so big. Next time I would mince the onions and slowly add the cornstarch to avoid clumps. Really great!

These were delicious!  I made them the first time with ground turkey and they were very good.  I only used 1 lb of meat but the full amount of sauce and it was perfect.  I served them over rice for dinner and we ate meatball sandwiches the next day.   Highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks, Lana!

Very good. Favorite part was the meatballs, might try using them in spagetti or something. Took the advice of others and cut the meat in half but used the full for sauce. Didn't have canned pineapple but had a fresh one, cut up chunks and then blended some in a CuisinArt and added water to make juice. Tasted great!

This makes a LOT of meatballs. I used 1lb. of ground pork and 1lb. of ground beef. Also doubled the sauce portion of the recipe. I would say if you don't want to make as much to make 1/2 the quantity on the meatballs and follow the sauce portion as it is. Very tasty over white rice.

I cheated and used frozen pre-made meatballs so I can't review that part of the recipe, but the sauce is great and got plenty of thumbs up from my guests.

I absolutely love this recipe. I use just over a pound of beef and end up making slightly bigger meat balls to where the sauce amount works out okay between them and the veggies. The larger meatballs take longer to cook, but it's worth it. I serve it over rice, but also once with cous cous, and it was all right. I didn't have any green peppers once and left them out, and it made the sauce too sweet, so don't skip those!

The sauce for these is great! I did make the following changes, I doubled all the sauce ingredients except the cornstarch and the pineapple, left out carrot and green pepper. I then used my immersible blender and made the sauce a little smoother and added the meatballs to that, and I had plenty of sauce for 3-16oz pkg of meatballs (store bought) and they still tasted good, but next time I will make recipe as is. All that can happen is that they taste even better.But in a pinch I will use this sauce and store bought meatballs.

Awesome! I upped the sauce by 1/3 like another reviewer suggested. Takes a bit more time to prepare and cook, but worth it. Big reviews from the family!

These meatballs were great.  I halved the meatball recipe & kept the sauce recipe at what the recipe called for.  The sauce was a little too much, even with rice, but still overall it was quite tasty.  Next time I will cut the sauce recipe in half as well.

The meatballs are yummy!!!  So easy to prepare and a break-away from frying! - combined with the sauce makes the recipe an excellent dish!  I used 1 pound of beef, 1 egg and the rest of the ingredients as specified - the sauce was just enough!  It was perfect!  Thanks Lana for sharing your recipe.

This was soooo good and fun to make!  My husband loved it too.  I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks and doubled the rest of the ingredients for the sauce.  I'm glad I did this because the sauce is really tasty!  I also added one red bell pepper.  This was a hit and I plan on making this for my next family potluck!

Loved the flavour of just the meatballs in this recipe.  I replaced the bread crumbs with equivalent amount of finely crushed saltine crackers.  I did not use the sweet and sour sauce included in this recipe, I like a darker sauce, but I still followed the recipe by baking in the oven (loved this idea...always fried before) and simmering in my sweet and sour sauce.  My family of 5 gobbled it up!!  Thanks, will make it again!

This is a great recipe for sweet and sour meatballs! I loved the taste of the meatballs themselves, and I liked the sauce because it was good but not way too sweet. Will definitely make this again! P.S.-I have added this to my regular menu "rotation." This time I tried it with ground turkey instead of beef, and it was good also. The beef has a little richer flavor, but this is a good recipe to try with ground turkey, since the sauce has a lot of flavor.

I thought the dish was easy and delicious. I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs for the meatballs.
My hubsand enjoyed this because the meatballs was very moist. The next time I make this I will add just a little most spice to the meatballs. Other
than that I would like to thank Lana for the recipe.

This was really tasty.  I also saved some time, and bought frozen chicken meatballs (which also cut down on fat).  I served them over brown rice, and it was very filling.  I'll be making these again.

This makes 8 servings so was enough for 2 full meals for us.  I made 2 cups of white rice to serve it with. I substituted an extra green pepper for the carrots since I didn't have any.  Beautiful in color and texture.  This has never happend before, but my 2 year old came back for seconds...both nights!  I don't like traditional meatballs, but enjoyed these.  My husband commented that it was the best sweet/sour sauce that I've made so far.  I was worried there wasn't going to be enough sauce, but it was plenty.  Quick and tasty, can't wait to make again!

Excellent meatball recipe!  I took these to work and everyone loved them!  I did leave out the soy and Worcestershire sauce though, and substituted them with teriyaki.  Wonderful!  Don't be afraid to add extra pineapple juice too!

this was absolutely wonderful.  i hate ground beef but these were fantastic! I used half the meat (about a500g or just over a pound of ground beef) and made the sauce as it is in the recipe.  this way I did not take a chance of ending up with a lot of something that either did not work out, or I would not eat.  Perfect amount of sauce with the meatballs for rice.  The only thing I would change is to add a quarter teaspoon of crushed red pepper to give it some heat.  thank you so much for sharing

Very good sweet and sour sauce, but a little too sweet. I'd cut the brown sugar down to about 1/3 cup next time.

Meatballs were great, flavorful. Sauce was great as well. I had to use flour instead of cornstarch as it's what I had on hand. I also used fresh pineapple so I didn't have any juice. I used the juice from a can of pears to make sure the sauce turned out ok. Satisfied my craving, I will make it again!

I did not add any sugar to the meatballs and they were fine without it.  We cut the veggies to a small dice because little kids were eating it. I doubled the sauce recipe but only added a scant one third cup of brown sugar. We also added pineapple chunks. Next time I will only add 1/4 cup of brown sugar or less to see if that helps the over-the-top sweetness of the dish.  We served it for dinner and served it over brown rice /quinoa mix from Costco that takes 90 seconds in the microwave and roasted Brussels sprouts.

We have made this numerous times and the entire family loves it. We are GLUTEN FREE and substitute non-gmo cornmeal for the breadcrumbs and use gf soy sauce. Makes a great gift meal as well. Delish!

I really liked them but they didn't get the wow factor I was hoping for from everybody else, not sure why as I thought they were amazing.  Everyone else liked them but I guess not as much as I did.

I only made the sauce as I had already made and frozen meatballs from the Meatball Nirvana recipe. I halved the sauce, omitted the salt and only used 1 tsp light soya sauce and 1 tbsp brown sugar, added half an onion with the red pepper and carrots. Added some Sambal Oleck before serving for a little kick, it was enjoyed by my family.

Wow finding this recipe was a total blast from the past.  30 years ago when I was a newly single mom of 2 boys money was very tight and back then and living in England meatballs were not a common everyday food, but I used this recipe with canned tuna!!  It was cheap and my boys adored it.  Served over rice just as this recipe and we ate it for years.  For some reason I forgot about it............  this brought back lots of memories about the struggle I had back then, going to college and working, with two boys.  Made it last night with homemade meatballs and it was as gorgeous as I remembered.  Going to feed it to my grandkids now!!  Found a vegetarian meatball recipe so now I can make it for my other set of grandkids.

The BEST homemade sweet & sour sauce ever! It will go great with any kind of meat. I realized I didn't have any corn starch, so I substituted flour with no problem. The meatballs were just ok. A bit boring. But the sauce? Amazing. I also doubled the sauce and am glad I did - I'd hate to see how little of sauce would have been left if I left it single. Will def make this again!

I really enjoyed this.  I cut the meat portion in half, so I only used one pound of beef instead of two, and altered the ingredients accordingly.  My kids loved the meatballs, and the sauce was perfect.  This will now be my go to recipe.

We did like this, I doubled the sauce-couldn't find any soy sauce,so left that out & had to make my own breadcrumbs-1 hamburger bun was enough. I used my food processor to chop the carrot, onion,& bell pepper. To add more flavor I did mix in a bit of honey & Dijon mustard at the end.  I will make this again,& add in some pork sausage to the beef.

I made this recipe exact as printed.  However, I found that 3 tablespoons of cornstarch was a bit much and actually made the sauce too thick.  I had to thin it with additional pineapple juice.  I will only use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch next time.  Overall it had a great flavor.

First of all if you don't like sweet and sour this recipe will not be liked.  
Spice it up with chili flakes if you like hotter. 
If you want a little less sweet don't add ketchup!  Try taking out a bunch of or all the sugar. 
You can add more flavor to the meat balls like a bit extra soy sauce or Spike seasoning but should concentrate, imho, on the sauce flavor as that is really the point of the recipe.

wow!!! SO DELICIOUS! so I always read the reviews. at least a good 25 or so anyways, you get a real feel for the recipe I think. Anyways, these meatballs are ROCKIN!!!! Ok, seriously, yes, it takes 15 minutes more to make your own meatballs than it does to just buy a bag of frozen at the grocery store, but REALLY! if you knew how the food industry has cut corners to bring you the cheapest, unhealthiest  possible for your "CONVENIENCE" I think you might change your mind about all that junk! Off of my soapbox though, I just ate one of the best meals we've had in a long time! I diced up three carrots and used a very large green pepper and so mine was heavy on the veggies but that's how I justify ground beef, so whatever. I left out the onions in the meatballs I find they only make the meatballs fall apart and I added a tsp of onion and garlic powder. I also don't add breadcrumbs or oatmeal to meatballs as that really just absorbs the fat from the burger and I'd just rather leave that on the baking pan. Also I did not add sugar to my meatballs...I'm sorry, that just seems gross to me...I like my sugar in the sauce on the outside of the meatball, thank you very much ;) Anyways, make double the meatballs and freeze half because you are going to want this meal again very soon and that part will be done. I can't wait to make this again. I'm going to double up all the prep work and freeze half of the entire so that I can whip this up very quickly midweek. THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT

Delicious sauce.  I had to change some things about the meat balls themselves, not because there was anything wrong with the recipe, but because I was using veggie crumbles instead of ground beef.  (Doubled the egg and the spices, added garlic) Still turned out wonderful!  Based on other reviewers suggestions I doubled the sauce.  Served over rice.  We very much enjoyed this and will make it again.

Outstanding recipe! When making meatballs, you can use grocer packaged beef/pork/veal mixture with terrific results, too. I found that about 1.4 lb meat generates about 3 1/2 dozen meatballs and the perfect amount to be covered by the sauce. If reducing your meat, adjust only the other meatball ingredients accordingly, and use one egg instead of two.

My mom used to make this all of the time so naturally I've added it to my cooking repertoire now that I'm on my own. My boyfriend loves it.

Definitely double the sauce or cut the meatballs recipe in half (depending on how many you're serving). We serve ours over quinoa and a side of broccoli or green beans.

TIP FOR BEGINNER COOKS: whisk your cornstarch with a little tepid water before adding to your sauce. Eliminates lumps :)

Good recipe if you like the sweet and sour flavors. I had a few in our family that didn't like the meatballs but that was a picky kid problem.
The only variation I made to the original recipe was to add more vegetables.

I didn't make the meatballs, I used frozen meatballs cause I was short on time, but I made the sauce, and simmered the meatballs in it and it was amazing! We all LOVED it.  Even my picky 5 year old.  I didn't put the carrots in it, but everything else I did.  I put a little less brown sugar than called for.  I also doubled the sauce.  I will definitely make again and again.  Thank you! Yummy.

This was delish a little sweet but good!  I made the meatballs as stated but i didnt cook in my oven did it stovetop.  I also dont have any cornstarch i mixed a little flour/butter mixture into the sauce and that thickened up real well with no lumps, all u do is take your flour mix into butter to create these butter balls and drop in, they melt and thicken.  Easy!

Sorry Lana, but this was not a hit with us. The sauce is good but the meatballs are kind of lacking much flavour. I think that maybe sweet & sour just doesn't 'go with' meatballs. Chicken or pork would've tasted better than meatballs.

The recipe was very easy to follow, there is definitely some preparation that go into it, but it is worth the work and it turned out absolutely delicious!  It is my boyfriend's favorite dish and he said it was much better than his mother's! Just don't tell her that ;)  We loved it!

This was awesome! I doubled the sauce as recommended and added broccoli - the kids (even the BIG kids) gobbled it right up! Thank you for the post!

Overall, this recipe was a hit. As others have said, there is not enough sauce for the full 2lb of ground beef so I would also recommend doubling the sauce or halving the meatballs. I did not find the need to add the extra salt, even using lite soy sauce. 

Sauce is thick and tangy, meatballs are moist and flavorful, veggies and pineapple give great crunch and sweetness. Will definitely make again. 

The two parts to this recipe could each stand alone to be used with other foods. Try the sauce and veggies with chicken or baked tofu and the meatballs with marinara! Very adaptable.

This is the best recipe for sweet and sour sauce.  I do add and extra tablespoon of vinegar and also about 2 tablespoons of ketchup.  I also only added the pineapple pieces and omitted the other veg in the recipe.  Cut the bread crumbs to a little less thatn 3/4 of a cup.  Found the meatballs a bit gummy with all those breadcrumbs.  Also cooked meatballs until cooked through and let cool.  Made the sauce and re-heated the meatballs when I was ready for dinner.

I made these for my daughter's birthday luau party and everyone RAVED about them! I cheated and used 5 pounds of frozen meatballs and I multiplied the sauce recipe by 6 and followed that part of the recipe to a tee. Several people asked me for the recipe! A huge hit and I will definitely make them again!

This recipe is great! It is one of the better ones I've seen. The meatballs taste delicious and this is pretty quick and easy. However, the meatballs didn't taste seasoned enough with the amount of seasoning the recipe calls for. So I would add a little more. Also, the amount of sauce is a bit on the low side for the amount of meatballs there are. Otherwise, a great dish! Thanks!

This was amazing! Everyone in our family loved it, even my most picky eater. The only change I made was to double the sauce recipe and I was glad I did. It didn't reheat as well as I'd hope but other than that it was a huge success!

The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, so I had to add more vinegar, but I would just reduce the sugar next time.  Otherwise, they were awesome!

This is just as tasty as when my mom made it for me as child (but she lost her recipe). I subsituted the meatballs with Nate's Zesty Italian Vegetarian meatballs and it was still just as delious! Thanks, my husband and 4 year old love it too.

I just made this last night for my hubby. This is his new favorite meal! I halved the meatball recipe and left the sauce recipe the same and omitted the carrot since I didn't have on hand. Served over rice, wonderful!

Quite tasty!  Used 1# beef vs. 2 and had plenty of meatballs.  Did have to TRIPLE sauce (not pineapple, carrots, peppers or cornstarch, though).  Omitted carrots & bell pepper (if had, would use colored bell peppers vs. green).  Tweeked measurements of spices to own liking (less salt, pepper, sugar, red onion).  Would use fresh ginger if I had it & maybe add a clove of garlic or two to the meatballs.

Made this with kielbasa instead of meatballs, omitted peppers and served over rice. A tasty, quick dinner. The only thing I didn't like was that the carrots stayed crunchy even after simmering for 20 mins, so make sure you dice them into small pieces.

Everyone loved this recipe!! I did cheat and used the frozen meatballs from Ikea.  Omitted ginger. (didn't have it and family isn't a big fan of it anyway)  Put everything in the slow cooker to heat up and keep warm.  nothing was left!

Great recipe!  I didn't have green pepper or ginger, so i just left those out.  One important tip is to make sure that when you add the cornstarch, that you add it slowly and constantly stir it until smooth!  I put all of it in at once and then stirred it, which created tons of lumps of cornstarch that i couldn't get out.  Even so, the end result tasted good - served over white rice :)

It was good overall. I made half the recipe for the meatballs but the full recipe for the sauce. I think the flavours in general could have been more intense which could be done by cutting down the water. I will make it again but next time I will reduce the water significantly and add more veggies (which will make up for some of the water reduced) to make it more balanced. Very enjoyable.

Delicious, kid friendly, quick go to recipe.  We used our favorite frozen meatballs to make this even simpler.  Taste the sauce after it's mixed but before you put the cornstarch in - you should get a good idea of how it will taste when done and you can adjust accordingly.  I only say this bec there were other reviews noting the sauce was too salty or sweet.  I found it to be about right but did add some of pineapple juice for more flavor (I used fresh pineapple too).  Definitely making this again!

Doubled the sauce recipe, tossed with store-bought frozen meatballs, put in the crockpot for xmas eve party.  So much better than the grape jelly meatballs which I really don't like.  I added a little chopped garlic.  Would also use the full doubled amount of corn starch, another review recommended four tablespoons but it was not enough to thinken nicely.  So yummy!  Make this.

I thought this was okay. The sauce is what makes this recipe work. The meatballs were not flavorful enough on their own...but homemade meatballs are still better than store bought, in my opinion. Next time, I'll add more seasoning to the meat and this will be even better. I did make these for a party and they were devoured by the guests. I also got several compliments...so it was well received. I doubled the sauce and made it a thick, sticky consistency so that it stuck to the meatballs.

You know -- everything about this recipe sounded great to me.  I followed the directions exactly.  It just didn't work for me -- the meatballs seemed to lack flavor and the sauce was kind of industrial tasting.  Not horrible, but nothing I would make again.

Delicious! Only I took everyone elses advice and doubled the sauce. I left the sauce with veggies and pineapples simmering for quite a while until they were tender. Also I didnt use as much cornstarch as it called for and I def advise mixing it with water before adding it or it will clump. Served over the 15 min fried rice I found on here. It was a very good meal.

It's been said already, but I'll say it again - double the sauce! I made 1.5 times the sauce and it still wasn't quite enough. The taste was pretty good, but I think the sauce could have used a little bit of zing. I might try adding some red pepper flakes next time.

I thought this was good; my husband isn't a huge sweet & sour fan but he ate it without too much complaint. ;)  Per reviews, I doubled the sauce as well as the vegetables.  This does make TONS of meatballs, so I froze the few that I had to bake in a second batch after the first batch had already been added to the sauce.

I am rating this recipe for the sauce only. Im sure the meatballs are wonderful but i wanted sweet and sour chicken so this is what i did. I deboned a store bought rottisere chicken (i use these for everything)! I doubled the sauce part and sauteed a sliced onion with a bag of frozen red and green sliced peppers (another great time saver, but unfortunately not all supermarkets have them) Served over white rice for a quick, easy and fantastic meal. Will try with the meatballs next time.

These were great!!  My family loved them.  We doubled the sauce, I found it was alot, I will probably make 1.5 times as much next time, and cut back the sugar a bit, just to try.  And I may cut back the pineapple as there was alot!  In the end, this is a recipe I will use regularly, thanks so much!

This review is for the sauce alone.This sauce is to die for. Very easy and simple to make. I did not make the meatballs, however they sounded delish. I used cut up chicken. Will never use store bought sauce again.

This was just okay for me.  Nothing spectacular.  I could hardly taste any of the seasonings.  I would suggest doubling the seasonings in the meatballs for sure.  They were kind of bland.
I'm not sure if I will try this one again.

This was very good.  I doubled the sauce like someone suggested with the 4 Tbsp. cornstarch.  I used red and yellow peppers.  I've used a diff. recipe for this in the past and think I prefer it a tad to this, just b/c there's a little more sourness to the other.  Maybe I could add more vinegar or something?  Overall very good and my kids loved it too.  My son isn't a big meat eater and was gobbling up the meatballs.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. I prefer to add 1 tsp. cardamom to meatballs and skip the vegies in the sauce. I also add chunk mixed fruit 5 or 6 min. before serving so they just warm for variety.

I used frozen meatballs but other than that I followed the recipe. It was wonderful, a little too sweet.

***Edit***
I used less brown sugar this time and it was much better.

The meatballs were so good! I made this for my husband because he loves anything with pineapple and he LOVED it. (I'm not a fan of pineapple so I'm going to try the meatballs with BBQ sauce) I made it for 3 so I just used one lb of beef and cut the rest of the ingredients for that in half. There was plenty of sauce and leftovers.

Yummy!  My husband loved this, my kids liked it, and I thought it was great.

Some reviewers have thought the sauce was too sweet.  I thought so at first, but as I ate more of it, I tasted the tang of the vinegar and it came out really balanced overall.  My husband agreed that I shouldn't change it.

This was even better as leftovers a couple days later!

The meatballs held together nicely.  Good proportions here of egg and crumbs to make any meatball a success.  I used 93% lean ground beef, and still the meatballs never gave any sign of wanting to fall apart!  The onion flavor was noticeable, but not overpowering.  It went very well with the other flavors.

This will get made again at our house!  Thanks for a winner.

This was a big hit with the family. The sauce had a nice flavor and was easy to fix, it just took a little while. I doubled the sauce and glad I did, it came out just right that way. I used rice wine vinegar and left out the carrot, other then that no changes. I served this with egg rolls and steamed white rice. This was great and I'd fix this again. Thanks for sharing this keeper!

We really liked this recipe: that means husband, 6-year-old and 3-year-old also.  I was trying to use up the end of a meatball bag, and this was really tasty.  I also used up some celery sticks I had as leftovers too.  I had some problems with the cornstarch: I think it was just too much, so I'll cut it down next time.  And I cook with less sugar anyway, so the 1/4 cup that I used was plenty.  But the taste was really good.  I'm not a big asian food fan, and this was pretty American tasting.  My husband even commented without any prompting from me!  That's a surefire sign that he liked it!

This was sooo delicious! I made them as an appetizer for a party and everyone who came within 5 feet of these meatballs could not stop raving about how great they were! I did not add the veggies since it was just an app. Sauce was a little thick, I'd reduce cornstarch next time.

Excellent recipe.  I did not have any ginger or seasoning salt on hand, so I substituted 2 tsp of Chinese Five Spice.  I served these at my mom's retirement party and they were gone in 45 minutes (over 175 meatballs!). This dish is a great addition to any potluck or family get together!

I have never made the meatballs in this recipe. The sauce is wonderful though. I do find it easier to buy meatballs and just throw the sauce over them. One tip: reserve the 1/3 cup water and whisk the cornstarch in with it. This way the cornstarch won't clump when you add it in.

Very good and very easy to make.  I did make some of the changes others had suggested.  I only used about half the meatballs (I froze the other half for later) and I reduced the cornstarch to 2 tbsp.  Next time, however I will double the amount of sauce -- there wasn't nearly enough, even though I only used only half the meatballs.  Overall a very good recipe!

The sauce was great and very easy to make.  I took the advice of others and bought meatballs to avoid the step of making them homemade. I would definitely recommend this.  The recipe for the meatballs didn't seem too extraordinary so I figured I wouldn't be missing anything.  This also allowed for cutting down the meatballs to around 25 which I felt was a perfect ratio to the sauce. I used a green and yellow pepper and purple onion, but next time I'll use other vegtables like carrot, peapods and celery since my husband does not eat peppers or onions.  The best thing about this recipe is that you can really use veggies of your liking and still have a great meal.

Really, really good.  I did use my own meatballs, and I had to omit the carrots and peppers because I didn't have time to run out, but the sauce itself was great.  Maybe a little thick, I would use less cornstarch next time, but no changes to the flavour.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made these delicious meatballs to bring to my friend's 40th Birthday party. I followed the meatball recipe exactly. For the sauce, I used triple the amount of ingredients (except for the green peppers and pineapple chunks -for that I used the amount called for)and it made the perfect amount of sauce. I made it the night before and put it in a crock pot to heat and serve at the party. People took one or two at first to be polite, but then went back for seconds and thirds. I'm glad I made three-recipes worth!! Three people even asked me for the recipe! This was simply amazing! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

These were fabulous, and very easy, as well as popular with our guests.  I'm not a green pepper fan, so we left that out, and it was just fine.  Be sure to chop your carrot pretty small.

Sauce was good, easy to make and looked nice with the cut up veggies in the dish.  Next time I might add some garlic to give it a little more flavor, but otherwise a nice recipe!

The sauce was outstanding but the meatballs were a little dry and that was with a little milk added to the recipe.  I'd like to try the sauce with chicken next time.

This recipie was very good, although, i used ground turkey instead.  I also served this over rice, and when i made the rice i put one can of turkey broth in it, this really brought out the flavor.

Thanks so much for this awesome meatball recipe.

This was great.  Used white wine vinegar and halved the meatball qty, so it was just the right amount for 2 of us. I also added an onion to the veggies and stir-fried all of them before adding to the sauce.  Basically cooked everything then put the sauce over it.  Loved the flavor of the meatballs.  Not bland like some recipes.

WOW!  First off, I'm vegetarian so I substituted the meatballs with block tofu, drained, chopped into one inch cubes.  I put tofu in plastic bag and tossed with 1 tblsp oil and about 1/4 cup flour.  Then I pan fried with 1 more tblsp oil.  I put the sauce, which was PERFECT using 1/2 UNpacked brown sugar so not too sweet over the tofu, etc. and it was awesome,  Honestly tasted better than our favorite Chinese Restaurant's sweet and sour tofu.  THANKS!

OMG! This is an awesome recipe. I don't like meatballs but they smelled soooo good while baking that I ate one plain. Just awesome! Hubby already wants to know when I will make this again! Thank you so much Lana and thank you Allrecipes.com for a great site!

An excellent recipe!! I made it for my boyfriend and he finished the whole thing. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and served it over rice.  I didn't add so much cornstarch and the sauce didn't end up so thick! Great recipe!

Husband doesn't like meatballs but really enjoyed these. Served them over rice. I did add a little more seasoning salt to the meatballs. Made these early in the day and took to a pot luck. Kept them warm in a crock pot minus the lid so they wouldn't get mushy. I too took the advice of others and doubled the sauce. Yum! Thanks Lana for the recipe!

I can't belive how good this recipe turned out!  It was great!  I have  had this dish many times, but I cant stand premade processed meatballs!  So this gave a great recipe for meatballs hand made with just a touch of sweatness to them.  I didn't have any plain dried bread crumbs so I used saltine crackers instead(I didn't notice any difference at all).  I would also recomend to make sure that you very finely dice the onions because they were pretty overwhelming in the meatballs when not done that way!  Thanks Lana, I have a new favorite in my house!

Lana, great recipe!  The meatballs were a great texture - perfect.  I doubled the sauce to use over rice and used two peppers: green & red for color.  I also mixed the corn starch with water before adding.  This was easy and yes, quite sweet, but that's nice once in a while.  It's a definite crowd pleaser!

This is by far one of the best meatball recipes I have used.  My husband always requests it for dinner.  The meatballs are moist and the sauce is fantastic. I'm going to serve it at a potluck here in Malaysia.  It will be interesting to see if the locals like it as well.

Thank you so much for this outstanding recipe.  My family has finally found a recipe that will definitely become one of our family favorites.  Even with all the ingredients it is still fun to prepare.  Everyone will think you slaved over the stove for hours preparing this wonderful meal and I definitely recieved wonderful compliments over the sweet and sour sauce.  Thanks again.

I made this sauce but I kept the pineapple bits and the liquid and I used the whole can of pineapple. I upped the soy sauce a little and the brown sugar I kept the same. I added a little more vinegar also and a little more water. This way I had more than enough sauce to put on my meatballs and rice. I have plenty of leftover sauce.

OMG!!  This was so much tastier than I really expected!!!  Simple ingredients that are usually on hand, simple to put together, and tasted great!  I was so surprised.  I used to make meatballs similar to this and used grape jelly for the sweetness, but this is much better..

This recipe is fantastic! My husband broke his diet for seconds and all three of my sons had thirds. I did make a few modifications but it was Turkey instead of beef, tapioca starch instead of cornstarch and red pepper instead of green. It was nothing to change the integrity of the dish. Because I used turkey I did add more seasoning to the meat than called for and it did quadruple the sauce but only used two cans of pineapple.

I doubled the sauce and thought it could still use more liquid.  I made the meatballs by pressing them out flat and then cutting them into 1" squares, which was faster.

One thing I’ve done different in this recipe is use frozen pineapple instead of canned as its much tastier. I add it unthawed at the very end. The pineapple is the only ingredient I don’t have an amount for as it’s easier to just eyeball it. This one change slightly alters the rest of the recipe. Here’s my changes:For the Broth, everything is the same except...Pineapple juice - 2/3-3/4 cup to replace 1/3 cup water (& juice that would have come from the canned pineapple)Sugar - 1/4 cup (less sweetness needed due to using pineapple juice instead of water)For the Veggies everything is the same except...1 onion - chopped Fresh ginger - minced (amount to taste)Frozen pineapple - added still frozen at the end (eyeball amount to compliment other veggies)

I used Costco Kirtland meatballs (precooked Italian-style beef), to save time. I then made up the pineapple sauce as directed. (I added a couple dashes of Worchestershire to the sauce :)) 
I thawed the meatballs in a crockpot on medium for couple hours. Then I put the meatballs in the crockpot with some large-diced red/green pepper. Dumped the sauce over the top and heated in the crockpot for a few more hours. Yum!

I made this sweet and sour sauce to pair with Chef John's crab rangoons and it was delicious! The sauce tastes just like restaurant quality but much more "real". I will definitely try the sauce with the meatballs.

I made this recipe, and followed it exactly except that  instead of bread crumbs, I whirled some oats in my mini food processor as a replacement.  The meal was absolutely delicious.  My family loved it and we will definitely make it again!

I added more watered in the sauce and more of the spices as well.  Next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar a little as well. 

I roasted the carrots, peppers, and added cubes onions in the toaster as well. Then added these to the slow cooker with the sauce and meat balls.  (Which I used a bag of frozen veggie “meat” balls)

But everyone loves the sauce!!!  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe

I made these using ground turkey instead of beef and they turned out great!  I only used one pound of turkey for the meatballs, but used the full amount of pineapple, veggies and sauce.  I also used only two tablespoons of cornstarch, and the sauce was just right.  Loved it!

I shared this with some neighbors and my family. Everyone loved it but my 6 year old ?? I only used 1 lb of ground beef and used my secret short-cut meatball trick of using dried stuffing mix and eggs.

This is a great recipe.  I cheat and use Costco Italian meatballs so that is goes quicker.  I also add a little more water, vinegar, soy sauce  and ginger to make more sauce.

I used pre-made, frozen meatballs and wish I hadn't... they were kind of tough.  I thought the sauce had a touch too much vinegar, but loved the pineapple!  I would add more green pepper next time.  With these changes, I would make again!

Easy to make recipe. It's quite tasty although a little too sweet. Will reduce half the sugar next time as there is enough sweetness in the pineapple.

As recommended by other reviewers, I increased the sauce to 3 cups (made 3 lbs hamburger instead of 2) using a combination of additional water and orange juice along with the pineapple juice.  Also increased the cornstarch. It turned out great!

Everybody liked it. Double the sauce. Add any vegetables that you may have on hand. I think that the peppers make this dish though. I prefer to add finely diced onion to my meatballs to give it extra moisture.

I thought it was okay the first night but the leftovers seemed to get more bland.  I know people loved this but it needed maybe some red pepper flakes or something to give it a little kick.

It was a great recipe. I added green and yellow peppers to bring more color to it. But I fed 250 homeless people with this recipe, I hope to find more to use.

This was good but I think I would like sirloin or flake or skirt or maybe even chicken better

3.11.18  I had some frozen Asian meatballs in the freezer, so I only made the sauce portion of this recipe which was way too thick.   I thinned out with additional water until I reached a good consistency.  In the future, I’ll start with 2 Tbsp of cornstarch instead of 3.  If the sauce is too thin, I’ll just add a little more cornstarch to thicken, which I think is better than adding more water diluting the flavor of the sauce.  Nice recipe, and next time, I’ll make this as a entree, instead of an appetizer.

Omgosh. My whole family loves this. I used an extra 1/2 cup of water to stretch the sauce and thin it out a bit to put over rice or mashed potatoes. I also baked the meatballs a tad longer to keep them shaped. Thank you for this incredible recipe.

These meatballs are one of my favorites. I usually substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and they come out excellent! Make sure to mix the cornstarch with a bit of water before adding to the sauce, otherwis it will clump up.

Very good- after reading reviews I cut the number of meatballs in half while making the called for amount of sauce.  I'm not sure the ratio is quite right that way, but if I had made the full amount of meatballs I fear I would have had too little sauce.  Maybe 3/4 the number of meatballs called for next time?  I used red bell pepper rather than green simply because of my family's preferences but otherwise left the recipe alone.  I think next time I might up the vinegar ever so slightly, but it was a yummy recipe as is.  I served over basmati rice.

Good flavor, my only suggestion is to continue to stir after adding the cornstarch to ensure it blends.

I was looking for directions for pre-baking the meatballs that go in the sauce I wanted to make, so they'd be less greasy and I could get them done a day ahead of time. I didn't rate this recipe for the sauce, which I'll try sometime, but for the wonderfully tasty meat mixture! I added a little 5-spice powder, cardamom, and nutmeg to this recipe, and we just tried one after it baked. These are great by themselves instead of being bland like meatballs often are, and will be delicious in many different sauces, it's a keeper!

Not really crazy about these.  Followed it exactly and found it easy enough to make.  Served it with white rice and fresh string beans, both of which seemed better than the meatballs and sauce. Actually the meatballs were okay just did not care for the sauce.. will not make again.

My husband loved this! I used premade meatballs from Costco - cooked in the oven and then stove top. I used a red bell pepper and threw in some leftover green beans. I doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers but only used 4 T of cornstarch. Next time I may use less water. I used the juice of the second can of pineapple but didn’t actually use the second can of pineapple in the recipe. Also, threw pineapple and green beans in for last five minutes as suggested by others. Served over white rice with eggrolls.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent.  Served it over rice, sauce was a perfect balance of sweet vs sour, meatballs were delish.  Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe.

If you can do this in an hour you are a super freak.  I just blew 2 pounds of hamburger because it said add sugar and I added the brown sugar...to the hamburger. (Me being the goofball here...the same guy who read that egg was good for a dogs coat...so I gave him an egg bath.  Don't do that.)  Turned out really good though (the meatballs that is...the dog stunk like hell) great aroma and flavor.  Will make again 4sure.

I cut the meatballs in half and kept the sauce the same. It would have been enough for rice. My husband and 7yr old love S & S Chicken so they really liked this. I don't, so this was only alright for me. I probably wouldn't make it again but they both really liked it. I also baked the meatballs longer and then let them absorb and soak in the flavor of the sauce instead of having them cook in the sauce. I wanted the carrots to have enough sauce to cook.

Great recipe.  I halved the meatball recipe as I only cook for myself.Only had to buy a green pepper. Had all the other ingredients on hand. Otherwise, made as directed and loved it. Shared leftovers with a neighbor who also loved it. Served with white rice and a green salad. Will make this often.

I've made this recipe several times as it is one of my favorites. The balance of sweet and sour is nice but I, too, make 1 1/2 times the sauce as we like to have lots over rice.  I use a red pepper instead of green because we like the sweetness of red peppers but that's just personal preference. Thanks for a great recipe!

The only change I made was used 1 pound pork sausage and 1 pound ground beef.  Turned out to be a hit.  I  also used a red pepper for a little of sweetness and color.  Definitely double the sauce!

My family and I did enjoy these sweet and sour meatballs.  I did as suggested and made more sauce than the recipe calls for.  The next day it was used as a topping for rice so the remaining sauce didn't go unused.  I will be making this again next month.

I'm not big on sweet meal foods. If I want something sweet it will be in dessert form. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not too sweet at all. I made recipe as is and it was great. I will be making this again.

I used fresh ripe pineapple, only pineapple juice (no water) and cut back on the sugar.  Everyone one like it. Next time I may try it with stir fried pork tenderloin.

Great recipe! I used a fresh pineapple and all water for the liquid and subbed coconut sugar for the brown sugar and it turned out beautifully. Like others mentioned if serving over rice, definitely increase the sauce. I doubled the sauce and only made half the meatballs and this was the perfect amount.

My go-to for several years now. Soooo good! But for sure double the sauce, especially if you’re wanting to put over rice. I never have and don’t like ginger so that’s the one thing I omit. Best sweet and sour meatballs ever!

Delicious. Modifications: Cut the meat quantity in half and kept the rest of meatball ingredients the same; still made lots of meatballs! Next time: Will add the cornstarch to a small bit of sauce before adding to the rest of the sauce to avoid clumps that were annoying to remove.

This recipe is awesome.  My only changes is that I used brown sugar instead of white sugar in the meat.  And I cooked the meatballs in the slow cooker, drained the fat, then added the sauce about 30 minutes before serving.

Wow these are so good. I made them for dinner on Friday night and we both loved them. I scaled the recipe for 2 servings and made more sauce, per other reviewers suggestions. I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful recipe. I added onion and celery and went with a red bell pepper. So colorful and very delicious. Served over sticky rice with rolls and a green salad. Best sweet and sour recipe I have ever tried. Thanks.

Super yummy. Did not use all of the meatballs I made because of the amount of sauce. I also weighed out my meatballs to 1.5 oz's and they cooked up quite nicely. I added one celery stalk very finely chopped to the meatball mixture. Just like the added peppery taste.  Put the extra meatballs in the freezer will use them in another recipe.

I thought I was really going to love this recipe but I found  it to be just so/so.  I did not care for the consistency of the meatballs and the sauce had a pasty taste to it from the cornstarch.  I don't think I will try it again.

Actually, I had homemade quasi-Italian meatballs in my freezer and was looking for an alternative to pasta sauce.  The sweet & sour sauce worked pretty well!    My picky son liked them, so a thumb's up for that.

Really quick and easy! I followed the recipe but did add some red pepper flakes for a bit more spice and used fully cooked Pineapple meatballs from BJs. Delicious! A big hit at the party and took no time at all!

Yes I will make this again.  My finished product did not look like the picture - I liked the picture better.   Next time I will double the sauce and not cut the carrot and green pepper so small.  
I think larger chunks of vegetables will look better.

So, so good! My only trouble came in that I've never used corn starch in a sauce before, so I just dumped it in which made it clump up into a bunch of globs that would not  stir in. Enter strainer - but so worth it. This was absolutely phenomenal. Better, even, the next day. I used more veggies than the recipe called for.

Wow!! Way better than any slow cooker method. I found the taste amazing but a little sweet. Next time I'll do 1/4 cup brown sugar and no sugar in the meat mix.  Bur other than that, unbelievably tasty! Thanks for an awesome recipe

This recipe is very good, I made it for my family as an appetizer and they loved it! I added my own kick to it and didn't add ginger, instead I added Cheyenne pepper powder to both the meatballs and the sauce and it came out very good. I used 2 1/2 pounds of ground beef and it made about 60 something meatballs.

This was easy and delish. After reading comments from others, I was concerned about the amount of sause it would provide, so instead of cooking it uncovered, I covered it and I'm pleased there's sufficient sauce.

I followed the recipe except for two things.   I used frozen store bought meatballs, and I used crushed pineapple.   The pineapple overwhelmed everything.   I will make this again,  but with 1/2 the actual pineapple.   I like the sauce itself but wanted less pineapple and more of the carrots and peppers.

Wonderful recipe.  The only change I made was to double the sauce and add a bit more spice.
Thanks for sharing your recipe

Soooooo delicious! And easy! But next time I'll cut the brown sugar in half or maybe even leave it out.

Great recipe, just added sweet red peppers and about a half cup more of water little at a time. Also cooked this on low with cover on pot for about 1.5 hours. Added the carrots and peppers  in the last half hour. Pineapple in the last fifteen minutes.

Followed the instructions for the most part but doubled the sauce. Because I wanted a full serving of veggies and one of my kids hates sauce on veggies, I just steamed carrots, broccoli and cauliflower separately. I cooked the pineapple with the meatballs and those who wanted to (like me!) could put sauce on the veggies. Will cook again. Kid2 didn't even put ketchup on the meatballs so you know the flavor was good.

Very good as is. A bit too sweet for my taste. I added 3 minced garlic cloves, and used fresh minced ginger instead. I found that there was indeed enough sauce to simmer everything in, those that seem to have a hard time with this part, try using a smaller diameter pan.

Wanted something different for dinner and came across this recipe. Sounded good so I thought why not. Am I glad I did!  Both the hubs and I really enjoyed this. Easy to make and very tasty!! Did double the sauce and glad I did. It would not have been enough if I didn't. Other than that, no changes to the recipe. Will definitely be making this again!

As suggested I used one lb of hamburger but the whole sauce recipe.  It was very good but too sweet for me.  I had used less than the suggested brown sugar.  Next time I would cut it in half.

This makes 40-50 meatballs and not nearly enough sauce, so double the sauce when making and you will be able to enjoy the meatballs over rice.

This was a huge hit!  I did not make the meatballs as I was using leftover roast pork.  I used fresh ginger and both red & green pepper. At the last minute when I realized the sauce was not quite enough I added about 1/4 cup of garlic hoisin sauce.

This was splendid. I had frozen   meatballs and just made the sauce. I added about  fifteen meatballs . I only had a small can or sliced pineapple so I cut it in pieces and added water to the juice. It was very good  and easy. I served it over white rice.

The final product was great. I skipped the granulated sugar which I didn't have and used half the amount of regular sugar instead. I also used pineapple tidbits instead of chunks, but that's a matter of personal preference. I would suggest adding more green pepper and doubling the amount of sauce.

I really enjoyed these. I also cooked them a little longer to ensure they stayed together when transferring into the sauce and that worked out perfect.
The recipe makes a lot of the meatballs, so as per previous reviews I doubled up the sauce.

Great recipe!  After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce (except for the brown sugar, which I only increased slightly), but the doubling was unnecessary.  Maybe if I had served this with a lot of rice I would have wanted a lot of sauce.  I didn't serve with rice at all, but I did increase the vegetables a lot, including adding cabbage, onion, and snap peas.  I also used ground turkey and chicken instead of beef.

It was OK but the cornstarch clumped up in the sauce and I feel the sauce could have been a bit sweeter.  Next time I'll add more sugar.

Good start, but meatballs need more flavor and the sauce needs way more vinegar if it is to be sweet and SOUR. Next time I'll try garlic and other spicespices too- it just needs something extra.

I made this recipe tonight. My rice is still cooking should have put in on when I started the meat balls. I used 2 cups of mini carrots sliced into about 1" slices and allowed them and the bell pepper chances to simmer in 1 cup of water for about 5 minutes before adding the sauce which I had mixed all together in a separate bowl.   Next time I am going to add about a cup of celery sliced into 1" diagonal and a small can of water chestnuts. They taste now but I think that will add something.

I didn't have onion or Worcestershire sauce available so I used soy sauce in place. Even with those changes it was VERY good. Definitely making this one again ??

We did not like these meatballs at all.  However, the sauce was outstanding.  I had made a double batch of sauce and saved the left overs.  We will add cooked shrimp to the sauce for another meal.

This is a fabulous recipe. 
I used 1 lb of sirloin chopped beef. I also used a red onion for the meatballs. Omitted the carrots as I thought to much sweetness. I also cooked the meatballs in the sauce an additional 20 minutes. I followed the sauce recipe to the  "T" and found that there was plenty of sauce for 1 lb of meat. I also used a red pepper instead of green as I am not a fan of green peppers. Following the way I made this recipe  is plenty to feed a family of four. Also served this over organic basmati can rice.

We really loved this!  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce with 4T of corn starch.  Omitted the carrots and added a red pepper.  Served over rice and it was delish!  We also discussed serving this as an appetizer....would really be fantastic.

Lana, your recipe is excellent. It's very easy to make. And it tastes great.  The sauce is PERFECT.It's the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had. Thanks so much for submitting your recipe.  I used a small cookie ball scoop to measure my meatballs. Baking them on a sheet tray in the oven was a great idea because so much of the fat renders out. I'm never going to fry meatballs in a pan again. I'm sure this is NOT a low calorie recipe but eliminating some of the fat is a great idea. I prefer home made to store bought.  Your sauce is a great one.  I will never buy another bottled sweet and sour sauce. By the way, I followed your recipe exactly.

Wow wee!!  Couldn't wait to try this and was not in the least disappointed!!  Definitely double the sauce...I used about a pound and a half of ground chuck and still doubled the sauce and the ratio of sauce to meat was perfect. Would not have wanted any less sauce.  I decided not to add carrots and instead used one red and one orange bell pepper bc thought the carrot wouldn't have cooked enough but now think the extra crunch of the carrot would have worked out great.  Used almost 4 tbsp of cornstarch which turned out great so I did NOT double that.  Added a little more soy sauce to counter the sweetness as it was a touch too sweet at first but once you add the meatballs and peppers the sweet factor was not as noticeable.  Decided to add about 1/4 or touch more tsp of red pepper flakes at the end which put it over the top!  Sorry for the long post but just loved this and want to remember how I put it together for the thousand of times I'll make this again!  Oh also thought this would be more time consuming but it really wasn't at all. Thanks for the post!  So enjoyed making this!

Loved it!  Doubled the sauce and it came out great.  I used ground turkey and added Lipton's onion mix along with what the recipe called for. I used flour as a thickener instead of corn starch because I didn't have any.  I served it over brown rice and added snow peas.  It is a wonderful dish that I have added to my dinner rotation.

Made this last evening and it was a hit!  Took other's advice and doubled the sauce. Also doubled Peppers and pineapple. I had three small bell peppers, red,yellow and green so used those. I sliced the carrots very thinly. 

The first thing I did was put two cans of pineapple in a colander over a bowl to drain while I made the meatballs. I got 2 cups of juice w/o water. I had 20 oz of ground turkey so used that instead of the 2 lbs of ground beef. I added a Tbsp of beef base (after mixing it in a little water) to the meat mixture to give the ground turkey more flavor. I used the same amount of breadcrumbs and seasonings as the recipe called for except the salt, because of the beef base having salt in it. I only had panko breadcrumbs so I used that. I have a small scoop for the meatballs so I ended up with 32 even sized meatballs. I used parchment paper in the cooking pan and baked them for 17 minutes. They were perfectly done and Oh my, I tasted one out of the oven and declared this my all-time favorite meatballs! Not one drop of grease in the pan and no cleanup with the parchment liner. 

I tasted the doubled sauce and added a couple more spoonfuls of vinegar to give it a little more balance, so it wasn't too sweet.  I simmered the carrots and bell peppers in sauce until almost done, but still crisp, then added the pineapple and meatballs to simmer about 10 minutes more. 
Served over buttered brown rice flavored with a little soy sauce.  Thanks Lana, this is a keeper!

oh my goodness.  Kids raved.  I was absolutely thrilled with the taste.  I will make the meatballs again and freeze them for a make ahead menu.  I see endless possibilities. I Made the recipe exactly as given.  
Oh and I made them too early so I dumped them in the crock pot to simmer on low.  Even better.  Sauce was just right in texture and meatball were tender and soaked in the sauce. 

I got one 'that taste better than I expected'.  a true compliment, especially after the second big plate.
You made grandma a winner tonight.
Thank you

Sorry, I don't use white vinegar to cook with, I don't use lean ground beef for meatballs, so, I used 1lb ground chuck, 1lb ground pork, use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, triple the sauce and had a fantastic meal.

I've been making this for years, (close to 50), but my original recipe called for catsup instead of vinegar and pineapple tidbits instead of chunks.   Thanks for reposting this as I haven't made it in ages but definitely plan to again.

Made this in my pressure cooker! Baked the meatballs for 20 mins, doubled the sauce and added red pepper flakes and a little more vinegar. Also used two bell peppers but only one can pineapple. Chopped the other half of the onion from the meatballs and added it. Placed the meat balls on top and pressure cooked for 10mins, did the corn starch slurry at the end. So yummy!

I doubled the sauce-I am not sure that I needed to do that,  but it was a nice amount of sauce.  I threw some asparagus from the garden in the pot too.  This was very good.  I will definitely make this again.

very good - although in my recipe it  has milk, ginger ale, catsup, ginger, garlic, hot pepper flakes, sugar, soya sauce - for the meatballs: ground beef garlic egg, breadcrumbs milk, salt and pepper, raw as they cook in the sauce - plenty of sauce -
simply delicious

Fantastic. Sauce is a little sparse for the amount of meatballs. Almost worth doubling the sauce, alternatively cut the number of meatballs. (That's the difference between 4 & 5 stars)

The recipe is excellent.  I just cook for two so I cut the meatball part in half and I doubled the sauce and served over rice.

I still had a lot left over, but it was just as good as leftovers.

First time ever that I made sweet and sour meatballs.  It was quick, easy, and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half for two of us for dinner, but when I saw the number of meatballs it made I kept half of them out of the sauce to freeze for later.  So basically I cut the sauce in half and it was the perfect amount.  I didn't have a green pepper; I used cabbage instead - that worked well.

I made this for a small group adult dinner as an appetizer. Rave reviews!!! I didn't have the ginger, so I left it out - still a great alternative to the tomato based sauces for meatballs. I doubled it and cut a bit of the sugar. I precooked the sauce and then let it cook in my slow cooker with frozen turkey meat balls - A Winner!

Soooo good.  Deviated by using frozen Italian meatballs thawed in the microwave and lightly sprinkled with ginger, worcestershire and sugar.  No green peppers.  Used carrots and chunks of sweet onion steamed before adding to sauce.

This is definitely one of my family's favorite recipes. Both of my kids love it (3 and 7 yo) and cheer every time I tell them this is what we are having. The only thing I do differently is use ground turkey to make it a little healthier.

Delicious!  My mom made these growing up and this recipe tastes exactly like hers did.  I served this as an appetizer (no rice) and they were gone!  Everyone loved them.  I used turkey since we don't eat much red meat.

I made the recipe as written, but only used half of the meat balls with the sauce. For us, that was just right. I froze the rest of the meat balls for another meal! This was easy, fast and made a great dinner. I think the sauce could be used for other dishes too. Thanks for sharing.

I had frozen meatballs that I needed to use up, so I didn't use the meatball part of this recipe, but I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was amazing. My family scarfed it down and went back for more. This is definitely a keeper!

Loved this as alternative to the grape jelly/chili sauce meatballs!  I bought frozen meatballs and just glazed the in the sauce with the peppers and pineapple.  I did add a few shakes of red pepper flakes for kick. Yummy!

Very good taste. Not overly sweet at all. Only complaint -  I had four servings of meatballs but the sauce really only made enough to cover half of that.  A keeper nevertheless!

Technically like a 4.8 since I tweaked it just a little to my family's tastes. I have made this dish twice now. The first time was exactly as the recipe stated, but it was a little too sweet and I didn't care for the ginger. The second time was perfect for our family. I omitted the ginger entirely and served over steamed white rice drizzled with soy sauce due to the overwhelming sweetness. I also made 50% more sauce than this recipe called for because we really enjoyed it. Thanks so much for sharing! Super easy for a busy mom of 5!

This sauce is fantastic in flavor.   It's pretty in presentation & can be frozen.  I am using it for a wedding & tested the frozen factor so I can make ahead.   I doubled the vinegar for less sweet taste.

I made a single recipe for the meatballls and doubled the sauce but I added 1/2 cup ketchup and a large springle of chipolte powder. RT is a sauce fanatic. He loved it had two helpings which does'nt happen often. I served it with stirfried carrots, red pepper, snow peas, and bean sprouts.I also added fresh ginger, minced fresh garlic, seasame oil, and toasted sesame seeds and a springle of crushed red pepper flakes. This worked well with the main course.
Thanks lana

This was DELICIOUS!!  My husband and I were savoring every single bite and kept looking at each other and laughing because we couldn't believe how good it was!  I didn't have pineapple chunks so I used crushed pineapple instead.  It actually worked wonderfully and it was pretty great having pineapple in every bite!  I still love large pineapple chunks so will try that next time.  I also added a red bell pepper since I had one in my refrigerator and needed to use it up before it went bad.  It was a great addition!  The only thing I would really change next time just to add a little more jazz would be to omit the ground ginger and instead julienne fresh ginger instead.  We LOVE ginger, so having bites of whole ginger would be so yummy!  I LOVE the meatballs even alone.  I am going to make a whole bunch and freeze them as some have suggested to use in other recipes.  What a great idea!  This is a really fun recipe to make.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!

The meatballs need more flavor. With alot of soy sauce I enjoyed eating them. My husband and daughter on the other hand didn't like it at all. I now have 3 recipes my husband never wants me to make again! I think it was the pineapples and the non flavored meatballs that got him. Sorry, not gonna keep this recipe for the future.

Very tasty sauce, but the meatballs are a little bland. I suggest adding extra Worcestershire, using Italian-style breadcrumbs, and maybe 50% more ground black pepper, a little extra onion, a little extra seasoning salt, and a little extra ginger.  (And, actually, I had slightly less meat than the recipe called for - so it would have been even blander. So don't be afraid to spice it up!)

For the sauce I prefer using red, yellow, or orange bell pepper. Not only do they look nicer, but they are a little sweeter and also easier to digest since they are ripe. (Green bell peppers aren't technically ripe and your body can't handle them as well.) 

All that said, it WAS enjoyable and I'll certainly make it again.

I have made this recipe many times with great results.  The last time I made it I added 1 cup of ketchup and it was delicious. By adding the ketchup I didn't have to double the recipe to have enough sauce for the amount of meatballs.

Great recipe - I just made a bit more sauce then the recipe indicated. Only other thing I changed is I used fresh grated ginger instead of ground. Easy and delicious - the best kind of dinner.

Wow - what a surprise this recipe turned out to be!  I have never had sweet & sour meatballs before.  The only thing I changed is that I used fresh ginger (about 2-3 times as much as it called for ground).  I thought the meatballs would be boring, but with the ginger and Worcestershire and ginger, they really had a good flavor.  Then the sauce added ever more!   I made an extra half of recipe of meatballs, and tripled the sauce based on other reviews so I'd have lots of sauce for the rice - worked out well.  The only thing I would do different is cook the carrots a little before adding to the sauce.  They were a little hard for my taste.  Will make again and again!

What a great, versatile dish.  Because I knew I'd be in a hurry, I used pre-made chicken meatballs ( but can imagine it would be that much better with homemade).  I also did nearly everything ahead of time - chopped veggies (but added extra:  carrots, red bell pepper, red onion and celery), made the sauce, and stored everything in the refrigerator.  When I got home from work, I started some rice in the rice-cooker, and stir-fried everything in the wok; started with the veggies, added the meatballs and then finished cooking through by boiling the sauce in the wok.  This was a huge hit and reheats well.  I felt the cornstarch ratio was a little high, but my husband liked the thick sauce, so I think it's a matter of taste.

I made this for dinner last night & it was great!! I made it exactly as the recipe is except I only had 1 pound of meat so I cut the meatball recipe in half but left the sauce the same so we'd have enough to eat with white rice. I also didn't have any carrots or peppers on hand, though I'm sure it would have been even better with them!! while the meatballs were cooking they smelt wonderful!! My only complaint was that next time I make these I will use way less ginger & only add it to either the meatball or the sauce but not both. It was way too strong for my personal preference since I'm not a huge fan of it. Other than that it was great & I'll definitely make it again!!!

EXACTLY what I was looking for!  Perfect.  For my family, I increased the meatballs, using 3 lb. of ground beef, but doubled the sauce.  It was just right.

Excellent!  Used ground chicken instead of beef, but it was soooo good.  Like other reviewers said, I halved the meat but kept the sauce the same.  Also used both a red and green pepper.  Will make again!

Great Meatballs!  I use crushed up soda crackers instead of bread crumbs, and you definitely need to make double the sauce.

This sauce is probably the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever made. I did not have a problem with the meatballs falling apart at all. I think I would personally add less pineapple chunks next time though.

I made this recipe for a Super Bowl Party and it was really easy and tasty.  I did use Ground Turkey for the meatballs and cut that portion of the recipe in half.  I followed the sauce recipe as it was.  Next time I make the sauce I will cut back on the amount of cornstarch I use.  Maybe two tablespoons will work better than three.

This was just okay.  I think if the protien was chicken or shrimp it may have been better, but the kids and I just didn't dig the meatballs too much.

Not a super fast recipe to make, but my husband and father really enjoyed the different flavors.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut the meatball recipe in half, but kept the sauce recipe as is.  It worked out fine.  I had 22 decent sized meatballs.  They each had 5 and then the toppings in the sauce on brown rice and were happily full.  LEFTOVERS!

I would give the meatballs five stars- they were sooo good! Probably the best I've ever  tasted. I didn't have eggs so I used mayo instead, it came out perfect. However, I did not care for the sauce. I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks, maybe that's why? I also omitted the peppers. I found the sauce to be wayyy too sweet. I will definitely make these meatballs again though, but with a different sauce.

These are awesome, the first time I made the meatballs and the sauce using turkey and they were fabulous! The second time I used some pre-made japanese flavoured meatballs and the just the sauce and that was great too! I have premade and frozen the meatballs so all I have to do is come home to defrosted meatballs, make the sauce and drop them in.

I did not change a thing to this recipe.  My husband is a very picky eater.  He does not like vegetables, peppers, onions, etc.  But I wanted to try something different.  I made sure to chop the veggies in large pieces so he could pick them out.  He ate these sweet and sour meatballs up.  I am giving this recipe 5 stars because he loved them.

Very good.  Next time I would change a few things.  First of all I would use real pineapple and real pineapple juice.  I hate "fake" pineapple out of a can.  I would also use real ginger instead of ground ginger.  The aftertaste I didn't notice it while I was eating it, but afterwards my husband, son and myself all complained of the  taste in the back of our mouths.  The meatballs were absolutely awesome and we did put it over rice as a main dish.  All in all very good and easy.

Surprisingly good. I have never ever been drawn to eat or make Sweet and Sour Meatballs. However I had a lot of  lean premium ground beef I had bought for several other recipes. I went on line for some ideas to finish off the rest of the meat. I thought Chef Junior may like this for a change but to my surprise it made a nice meal served with White Jasmine Rice, Salad and Crusty dinner rolls. My favorite ingredient was the Pineapple. This is a good meal to have if a group of kids will be at your home for dinner!

This was a great meal to get away from the hum drum meatball.  My whole family liked it including the kids.  I did double the sauce. The meatballs had a great texture and makes delicious leftovers.

Loved this recipe.  I did not use the carrots or green peppers because no one else in my family is a fan of vegetables.  Also I made half the meatballs and the full sauce recipe.  It was barely enough to put sauce over the rice so I would make more sauce next time.  Also I would use less cornstarch because it got very glue like, but still delicious.

This is a great recipe!  I did what other suggested and doubled the recipe for the sauce.  I used red and green peppers and added 1 tablespoon of hoisen sauce.  Delicious!

Very good recipe, but I agree with others to double the sauce.  I did double all the sauce ingred (except the canned pinapple) and served over steamed jasmine rice with some broccolli on the side.  A good dinner.

This was excellent!  I used ground turkey because that is my family's preference. I also used fresh grated ginger--not dried powdered ginger. It was delicious over brown rice.  I can't wait to make it for company!

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it. I doubled the recipe as there was not enough sauce with just one batch. I also used frozen precooked meatballs as I didn't have any ground beef. A definate keeper and will make again

I made this for New Year's & everyone said that they were so good.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Now I have to make this again Saturday for a Baby Shower.  I tripled the sauce & used 6 lbs of frozen meatballs.  **** Ok -- this is the 3rd time in 2 weeks that I have made it & it comes out great every time..

the best meatballs I've ever made.  I substituted ground chicken and used fresh ginger in lieu of ground ginger.  i made these for my toddler twins so added grated carrot to the meatballs too.  a huge hit!

These were good, not wow but good. It felt like the meatballs were missing something. Not enough of a sweet and sour taste for me. Dont get me wrong these arent bad, my kids liked them alot but my husband has rather become accustomed to the bold flavors I like to cook with. If our taste buds arent set off with sparks then something has to change. I will play with the recipe and update it again later.

This was an overall good recipe, it wasn't fabulous, but it was good.  The sauce is versatile enough to use with other meat.  We've had it with meatballs and chicken thighs.

This is a good recipe just not fantastic. I found that it needed more sauce after cooking an additional 20 minutes on the stove top. It still had great flavor and goes great on a bed of rice. I would make this again and try to add more sauce, maybe reserve some in a sauce pan to drizzle over the top at the end.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe for sweet and sour sauce. I used frozen meatballs to make it easier, and doubled the sauce like some reviewers suggested. My guests and my husband and I all enjoyed it, only complaint is it doesn't reheat very well.

YUM! and it didn't take too long to make. I had to double the sauce to coat all the meatballs it made and served over rice. The only change I made was omitting the seasoning salt (didn't need it) and I squeezed a lemon into it to tame a little of the sweet. I would be happy to make this for any potluck. 
The meatball recipe is also pretty good by itself. 
Definately a keeper. 
Thanks!

I thought the proportions were a bit off... not enough carrot to pineapple ratio. And I can never get meatballs to be the way I want I them!! They always end up really dry. Their flavor was good, though. =)

This is a good sauce. I used a big bag of frozen meatballs and quadrupled the sauce to put in a crockpot for a family potluck. I got several compliments on it. Because I was using them as cocktail meatballs, I left out the veggies and i added one can of chunk pineapple and the rest in pineapple juice.  I also added some chopped garlic. i will make this sauce with the veggies and serve with rice and chicken at home.

Not bad for a sweet and sour meal...but hubby and I found it way too sweet.  The meatballs had good flavor so I may  hold onto the recipe for them.  Maybe we're just not fans of sweet dishes.

Very Yummy.  I didn't have canned pineapples but did have a little can of pineapple juice.  Worked very well.  I added some marachino cherries and some of the red syrup because it looked a little yellow to me for me to consider it a true "sweet and sour" look.  I heated up the sauce first until it was all bubbly and threw everything in a crock pot.

I've been asked to make this recipe 5 times!  I hadn't tried it until I made my own vegetarian version and it is so good.  I don't stray from the recipe in the slightest (except for when it's for me then switch out beef with veggie crumbles but these tend to fall apart so I may try smushing seasoned tofu) and it is awesome every time.  I've read other's reviews and I could totally get down with doubling the sauce/vegetable portion of the recipe... it's delicious + people need more vegetables anyway.

DELICIOUS. The meatballs are great on their own, could use with a regular tomato sauce as well. Would double the sauce next time as others suggested. YUMMY!

This was real good.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it - my husband, myself and our 3 sons ages 7,5, and 1.  I will be keeping this recipe.  I followed the recipe exact, but I didn't have a green pepper so I left that out.  Thanks.

I just made this for dinner the other night and it was a big hit!  Following other reviewers comments I doubled the sauce (since I was serving as a meal over rice) I also omitted carrots because I didn't have any.  All in all this was very tasty but also very sweet! Next time I will cut down on the sugar a bit, but still delicious!  I am sure it would make an excellent app. too.

Even my husband who doesn't like sweet&sour thought these were pretty tasty. It certainly hit the spot. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be sure to share this one.

Very tasty, but I doubled recipe for sauce, as it is a bit skimpy on the sauce! (Personal preference)

I helped my girlfriend make this at a party - she used the frozen meatballs from BJ's. This was by far the biggest hit of all the foods she had out. YUMMY

This turned out really good and the sauce was better than I expected! I used turkey for the meatballs and they were so easy to make. I didn't use green bell peppers and one suggestion on the carrots....maybe it would be better to cook them first before letting it simmer on the stove with everything else because they were still crunchy. I halved the meatball recipe but used the full sauce amount and it was just perfect. My husband and I ate this over white rice and he thought it was yummy.

Since I prepare meals for two of us at home AND also for my son's family (he's a Single Dad) I'm always cooking in bulk.  This meal (using the recipe exactly as it was submitted, except that I DOUBLE the sauce) has gotten rave reviews from everyone in the family.  The recipe has become a "regular" treat that's since been shared with at least a half dozen friends as well.  Thanks so much for sharing it.

Very good, but something about it was a little odd to me.  I served the meatballs with pasta the first time and rice the second.  I liked it much better with rice.

I REALLY liked this recipe. However, my husband did not (he did eat it though!) I used a mix of ground turkey & ham just because that's what I had.

Soooooo good!  I made it for my husband of 2  months- and he loved it too!  I made it with 99% fat free turkey... so it was healthy and really tastey.  I actually cut the meatball portion in half, but made the normal sauce- which ended up to be a great portion. We had lots of extra sauce to pour over rice.  Thanks!

Delicious, colourful and easy... will try with chicken next time, and will be doubling the sauce -- just not enough for all those meatballs.  Also, found the meatballs a little flavourless, so will be adding some more pizzaz the next time... and there WILL be a next time!

These are a wonderful, make ahead meatball to have on hand for company.  I don't like chunks of pineapple, so I puree the pineapple in a blender and add it to the sauce.  I also skip the carrots and pepper, because I am too lazy to chop it!  We like this served with mashed potatoes.

Excellent! I changed the ingredients a bit - used red pepper and store bought frozen meatballs. With store bought meatballs you can throw it in the slow cooker - great for a large party.

These were nice and tasty.  I didn’t put the pineapple chunks in because I thought they might get too sweet.  I was correct.  The sauce was already sweet enough and they were a hit.

This is really excellent. I've made it twice - the first time exactly as written and the second time I had to substitute because I realised I didn't have any pineapple! I used 1/2 c of orange juice and added about 2 tbsp of white sugar, as well as the brown sugar. Just used for veggies to bulk it up. My husband said he liked it better than with the pineapple! And my two year old can't get enough. Definitely a winner.

I was looking for something different to make for my family & warned them that I was trying a new recipe! But this was really yummy! The kids loved it (except for the green pepper) & I will definately make it again. I halved the meatball recipe & it still made plenty for all of us.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It really didn't have the type of sweet and sour taste that I  was looking for.  I think I'm going to stick with the other sweet & sour meatballs recipe I found on this site. Thanks though!

Very good stuff!!  I used my new Kitchenaid mixer to beat it all together, and was very satisfied.  I wish the meat had a little extra spice, but I don't know what.  Definitely a keeper!

OM MY WORD!!! Absolutely the best meal I have made off of here. I did have to make a change also, doubled the sauce with only one can of pineapple because thats all I had, did not add all 2 lbs of meatballs to the sauce that I did have and added a little garlic to the meatballs. The sauce is delicious! Alterations do not give reason to give this recipe any less than 5 stars!!!
Thank you!!! Can't wait to make it for some of my church family!

The recipe was really easy to follow and it came out very pretty. However, both my boyfriend and I thought the sauce was just too pineapple-y. We had to put some ketchup on it to balance out the sourness.

The sauce was excellent and my kids and I loved this recipe the way it is, but the hubby thought the meatballs were a little bland, so when I make this again I will add some garlic and maybe more seasoning salt.

These meatballs were really good. I added onion and more carrots. I used 1 pound of beef as other reviewers said there was not enough sauce for 2 pounds. This worked out perfectly. I served them over rice.

this is a good recipe for something different. the flavor is great. i would suggest either making half the amount of meatballs or doubling the sauce-i had made half the amount of meatballs because i didn't have enough hamburger, and it was just barely enough sauce. we served it over rice and it was good.

These meatballs were very tasty.  Out of necessity I had to make a few changes.  I didn't have any pineapple, but I did have a can of Dole Tropical Fruit Salad (pineapple, papaya, and mango) and I added a can of chopped pears because it didn't look there would be enough juice.  Even with the changes, the meatballs turned out wonderful!

I don't think I did this recipe justice by using store bought meatballs (to save time). I'll try again using Lana's full recipe. I made this as a meal over rice- I followed the suggestion to double all ingredients, except for cornstarch (increase only by one TBSP). I also added some maraschino cherries for color as someone suggested. Both suggestions worked well..

I made these for my husband because his grandmother used to make them for him.  I wasn't crazy about it but the rest of the family loved this new dish.  My husband said they were just as good as his grandma used to make.  I will definetly make these again.

These were OK - but eating meatballs in such a traditional sweet/sour sauce was a bit different. Next time I'll stick with pork or chicken.

Sorry to say but this recipe was not one of my favourites. My son loved it though but in the future I'll leave the sweet and sour sauce to chinese food. I prefer my meatballs spicier.
