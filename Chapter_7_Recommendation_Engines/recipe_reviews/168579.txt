This recipe was excellent! (I did not add  any honey, and I used splenda brown sugar and also I didn't have any sake, so I substituted rice wine vinegar.

This recipe is quite delicious as is.  I made this for the first time tonight for 4 people and doubled the recipe.  We had at least 2-3 servings of leftovers!  EVERYONE enjoyed it, even the finicky eaters!!  I am not a fan of hot, spicy food, so I used only half the amount of the ground red pepper, but next time I will use the full amount.  For more of an Asian taste, I would suggest substituting green onion in place of the regular onion that the recipe calls for and add crushed peanuts as a finishing touch!  Otherwise, this recipe is AWESOME and I will definitely make again in the near future!!!!  The peanut sauce is PERFECT as is.  It's smooth, thick and creamy and makes the dish quite filling.

Super tasty! If you like it saucy like me, add less noodles! Used whole wheat pasta as well, could not even taste the difference. I doubled the recipe and added little more peanut butter than it called for and doubled the red pepper flakes, we love it spicy and sweet! If you like less sweet, add less brown sugar and honey than what it calls for. I added 3 thin sliced  chix breast as well. Cooked everything in my well seasoned wok, turned out perfect. Cooked Chicken before the veg's and cooked everything in peanut oil not veg oil. Did not add the Sake but added a couple of tbs of rice wine vinegar to counter the sweetness of honey and brown sugar.

I made this last night for dinner and it turned out wonderfully!  I omitted the honey, and used wine instead of saki.  To save time - and a pot - I microwaved the sauce for about two minutes to thicken and cook.  This was exactly what I was in the mood for. A nice salty/sweet flavour and the sauce sticks well to the noodles.  I added chicken to mine as well, and the flavours all melding beautifully.  Love this, and will definitely make again.

If you like Thai peanut anything, look no further. This sauce is the bomb. Great over noodles or rice. Add chicken or shrimp if that's your thing. I left the red pepper out of the sauce and threw in chopped habeneros, jalapenos, and chiles from our garden (two each) with the stir fry. Perfect heat. Makes you sweat but doesn't burn as long as you core the peppers (no seeds or pulp from the center). The sauce is the winning part. No need for the Sake if you don't have it around.

Great taste!  Based on other comments, I started out with only 1 Tbs of honey and 1 Tbs of brown sugar.  Very happy with the result.  Also, didn't have the sake but I everyone loved the flavor without this addition.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you cooking mama.

I looooooove this recipe, though since I use allll natural ingrediants (meaning I have to chop everything), it takes me a good hour and a half to two hours to make...also because I'm pretty slow still. :-) Per other reviews, I omitted the honey, and I have no idea where to get sake in Mexico, so I don't add that either. My American and Canadian friends love it, my Mexican friends aren't quite as impressed...spicy and sweet I don't think goes well with the Mexican pallet...they're more into spicy and salty, or spicy and tart. Anyway, this is my absolute favorite thing to make, when I have the time.

Very very good !  I suggest that you guys forget the spaghetti.I  used fresh udon noodles instead , so it tasted more authentic. Also I increased the ginger to 1.5 tbsp and omitted the broccoli. The  dish was very very GOOD!!!!!

Love the concept and as written (minus the sake) was good; however, it was a little on the sweet side for me and not that spicy.  So next time I'll play around with those aspects and get a 5 star recipe out of it!  On the bright side, my 5 yr old did actually willingly eat a few bites without complaint!

I really didn't care for this too much -- way too sweet and I didn't even add the brown sugar. To be fair, I didn't have any sake, so maybe that would have made a difference. Sorry!

This is an excellent recipe. I have already made it a few times. Some things to keep in mind: 

--I used chunky peanut butter, and it didn't seem to make a difference.
--I used more ginger than called for
--I used more red pepper flakes because I like it spicy
--Since I didn't have any sake on hand, I subsitituted fresh lime juice, and it definitely did the trick. 
--I also used far more garlic than the recipe called for because I'm a garlic . :)
--I did not use onion; the veggies I used were red peppers, broccoli, carrots, and green beans. 
--Oh, and make sure the noodles are thin, like angel hair thin. This affected the flavor for me.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made several on-hand substitutions on this recipe and it still turned out great.  I used broccoli, onions, garlic, and frozen whole green beans for the veggie mix; I used beef stock in place of the vegetable stock; and had no sake or rice wine vinegar so I left it out completely. I reduced the brown sugar to 2T and the honey to 1T based on previous reviews, but next time I will probably try it with the full amount called for because the sweetness didn't really come through. I was unsure on the amount of spaghetti, as a standard package is actually 16 oz (I have never seen an 8 oz package?) I ended up boiling the whole 16 oz and used about 3/4 of it just eyeballing it for how much sauce I wanted. I also topped the pasta with thin sliced chicken breast.  My whole family enjoyed it, including the 18 month old, 4 year old, and generally carb-averse husband!  I was really worried about the beef broth being an issue, but it turned out delicious anyway. I look forward to making it "the real way" one day soon too!

Good.  I liked all the vegetables.  Next time I will cut the sugar and honey down to about a third, increase the red pepper and add some salt.

I thought the flavor was delicious. I did add more rice vinegar, per suggestions, to cut the sweetness and a little fresh lime juice. I guess I would cut back on the sweetness the next time but overall, I think it was superb.

Interesting recipe. I doubled it and found it too sweet. next time I make it, I will only use 1/3 of the honey and brown sugar...I added a little extra ginger, red pepper flakes and more peanut butter.

With conflicting reviews on sweetness etc I decided to make the sauce as is to form my own opinion, but I made it with rice vermicelli and added chicken thighs. I stir fried 12 cut up chicken thighs first in my wok, then removed chicken to start onions and garlic etc. I  added chicken in with the sauce once that was finished. I served the vegetables, chicken/sauce and rice noodles all in seperate dishes, which looked better for company. Everyone loved it! I thought the sauce had perfect flavour but needed just a bit of added salt to bring it out more ( I used light soya sauce in the original recipe). Tripling the sauce made enough for 8 people, including a few second helpings.

Made this as is and it was good. Second time I made this I did what other reviewers mentioned and lessened the honey/bsugar. Even better! I rated 4 stars for the original recipe and it deserves a 5 star with the changes. 1) lessened honey and brown sugar to 1 Tb each, 2) My kids don't like the heat so used a pinch of cayenne pepper which left the after taste kinda heat instead, 3) sub rice wine vinegar instead of sake because I ran out, 4) used deep fried noodles instead of spaghetti noodles for a more authentic Chinese feel, 5) added chicken because we are carnivores, and 6) added peanuts at the end just before serving as a garnish...DELISH! Added this to the dinner rotation. So simple and full of flavour

Love the peanut sauce. I omitted the sake and it still turned out great. I always substitute reduced fat products and it was still awesome. I used a wok and soba noodles.

This was very good, but too sweet as written for my tastes.  I would cut both the honey and brown sugar by half (or just pick one and use 3 Tbsp of it).  Only other changes were to use fresh grated ginger and a few shakes of Sriracha in place of the cayenne, and like others I added the juice of one lime.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because my kids really liked this; my husband and only rate it a 3; we both thought that the taste of peanut butter was too strong.  We haven't had Thai food before so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I followed the recipe as stated but I think that if I make this again I will cut back on the peanut butter.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just made it tonight and it is delicious!! I had to omit the pepper flakes because I'm intolerant to chilis (I get really sick), so I slightly reduced the brown sugar and added a bit of salt and more peanut butter to avoid making it too sweet. I had to switch out sake for rice vinegar because I had no sake, but I will definitely use sake next time. 
we also added chicken and crushed peanuts as a garnish.
It is delicious and we will definitely make this again. 
Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe.

Delicious! Great peanut flavor without being overwhelming.  I like it spicy, so next time will just add a bit more chili pepper.  You can use almost any kind of veggie you have in your kitchen; cauliflower and cabbage work great too.  Use udon or other rice noodles instead of spaghetti if you can, the flavor will be more authentic.

This is really good.  I like to make extra sauce, use rice noodles, add chicken or shrimp.  I never have sake so I add a bit of rice vinegar.  My kids won't eat spicy things so crushed red pepper gets left on the side too.  Plus, i never have a ton of honey, so I go with 1 TBSP and its plenty with an extra TBSP of sugar. Great for any veggies you have.  Tonight was CSA explosion..zuccs, green beans, sugar snap peas.  This time I decided to make LOTS of sauce and freeze some.  We will see if it works!

I enjoyed this recipe, the sauce was quite nice.  I recommend mixing the corn starch with an equal amount of water before adding it to the broth however; otherwise you end up with lumps that are difficult to disperse.  I substituted bok choy for the red bell pepper, simple rice cooking wine for the sake, and crunchy peanut butter for the smooth with no ill-effects.  I think this recipe would benefit from using fresh grated ginger rather than ground.

Awesome! Love the sauce even without the Sake as others mentioned. I was out of ginger and I substituted pene for the spaghetti noodles and it still turned out amazing.

Loved this! I used the sauce recipe only and thought it was very good. I might use chili paste for the crushed chilis next time since I like it a little hotter. Didn't have sake, used rice vinegar which was fine. I used frozen stir fry veggies from Costco, saving a lot of time and money, plus a chicken breast . The veggie quality is pretty good. I'm planning to make it for my kids home on spring break and add some Udon noodles  to it. This sauce is just what I was looking for!

I liked this but I thought it could be much better.  I put shrimp in it and used rice instead of noodles so maybe those changes ruined the recipe.

Very good!  I added the juice of one lime because I think it needed more acid.  Also doubled the recipe, sliced up 6 chicken breast and cooked chicken in sesame oil and a little soy.  I also ended up adding a little more veg broth at the end because I wanted the sauce a little thinner.  Used one package of whole grain speghetti.  Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent peanut sauce!  I loosely followed this recipe, incorporating veggies that were on the verge of going bad in my fridge.  Instead of mixing with pasta I made coconut rice.  I love the combination of coconut milk and peanut.  Definitely will make this one again and again.

Awesome recipe. If you are a fan of peanut sauce, you will love this. It has the perfect amount of sweet, spicy and salty. I added some stir fried chicken, left out the sake (by accident though, I actually did have some!) and added some extra veggies. We will definitely be having this again.

We loved  this! We did not have sake, sweet red pepper or peas. I used yellow and orange peppers and a little extra broccoli and carrots.  I used about 1/2 the brown sugar and will probably omit next time. We garnished with extra crushed red pepper, cilantro, peanuts and fresh squeezed lime juice. Definitely making this one again!

It was a bit too sweet for me with both the sugar and honey, so I cut the brown sugar out. I've also found rice wine vinegar to be a good substitute for sake if you don't have any on hand. 

I also add a lot more red pepper flakes for my personal preference, but that's very easy to adjust as needed.

Added twice as much red pepper flakes and about half the honey and brown sugar. I didn't have any sake, but it didn't matter. You can definitely play with the sweet and spice to get it just how you like it.

Like others, I skipped the brown sugar and subbed rice wine vinegar for sake since we had none; all else as written and it was terrific!  Oh and I had Thai noodles so used them, and added some poached chicken. Delicious, thank you!!

Oh my Lawd! This meal was spectacular. My husband was supposed to cook for dinner guests tonight but he forgot all about our meal. That meant I was up to bat...I raced home from work and jumped on Allrecipes with stir fry and peanut butter on the brain (because we have three containers in the fridge!). I didn't have sesame oil (substituted rice bran oil) or sake (substituted nothing), and just kept moving forward. I added chicken to the dish and cooked it in the pan just after cooking up the onions and garlic. It was awesome. Would definitely make this again. And it cooked up FAST!

Hands down the best meal I have ever cooked! I took some reviewer suggestions and cooked the veggies in sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also used the juice of a lime instead of saki and added chopped peanuts as a garnish.  I doubled the recipe in hopes of leftovers... they didn't make it past lunch the next day! Cannot wait to try this out on my foodie sisters :)

I will definitely make this again! I used frozen vegetables (the stir fry mix) and added chicken. It turned out great! I'm sure it would've turned out even better with fresh veggies, but I didn't have them and using the frozen veggies saved chopping time. This whole meal was done in under 20 minutes!!  Other substitutions I made: package of yakisoba noodles instead of spaghetti, crushed red peppers instead of ground red pepper, vegetable oil instead of sesame oil, chicken stock instead of vegetable broth, crunchy instead of creamy peanut butter, and I left the sake out.

Loved it! I omitted the sake, cause I didn't have any. Used pkg. stir-fry vegetables and added shrimp. I might use a little less peanut butter next time though.This will definitely be an staple at my table!

This is really good.  I cut back a bit on the honey because I was a afraid it would be too sweet and am glad I did and was generous with the peanut butter.  I didn't want to buy sake, so I substituted white wine.  I tasted the sauce before and after the addition of the wine and it did taste better after.  I wanted the kids to try tofu, so I mixed into the sauce just before stirring all together.  At the end I sprinkled some crushed red pepper and green onions.  The amount of spice was perfect.  Loved it.   Will crave this one for sure.

So good! Great recipe! I just made this, substituting some of the veggies for the ones I had at home! All easy ingredients that most people already have and easy to make!

This needed a lot of sriracha to take it from edible to yummy.  I looked through the comments and made a few tweaks (rice wine vinegar instead of sake, cutting down on sweetener) and also added sambal oelek to the sauce.  I don't think I would make this again as written, but might try again with more sauce modifications (maybe fresh garlic and fresh ginger) because the texture was really nice.

Very good.  I didn't use brown sugar, instead I put in 1 TB splenda - next time I don't think I'll do that as it was pretty sweet.  I subbed crunchy pb for creamy and rice vinegar for the sake and used rice noodles.

This was okay, but it didn't make me want seconds.  I've tasted other Thai pasta recipes that were more flavorful.

This was delicious! The only change I would make is to use a little less sweetener (honey or brown sugar) as I found it to be a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will probably add some chicken.

This was great! I also cut down on the honey (2 tbsp) and omitted the sake. I used beef broth because I didn't have any vegetable broth and it was fine that way. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious and quick recipe! The only thing I omitted was the sake as it's not something I usually have on hand.  Little too spicy for my 3yo but the rest of the fam loved it!

This was different- but very tasty. I made a few changes:  I used onions,zucchini, squash, & sweet banana peppers for the veggies, because I didn't have the others and I needed to get rid of some from the garden. I chopped it up fine because that and peanut butter sounded kind of strange. For the sauce I substituted the honey for molases (1 tbsp only) again because I didn't have honey. I also added diced grilled chicken. Yummy.

Yum.  Even my boys (9 & 12) ate it with only minor complaints about the broccoli.  As recommended by previous reviewers I left out the brown sugar and cut the honey down to 1T.

One of the best peanut sauces I have tasted although I omitted the honey. If I used natural PNB I might have put it in.

Great taste and loved by everyone, even the fussy eaters, at our birthday celebration.  Add chicken marinated in peanut sauce for a meat dish.

Good sauce, though I added only 1 teaspoon of honey, omitted the brown sugar, and added  perhaps a tsp of lime juice and some minced garlic. Will add more red pepper flakes next time as we like lots of spice & heat
