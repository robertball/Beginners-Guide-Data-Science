A good way to seek fruit into a meat and potato eater's diet... just present it as a desert and they will ask for second.

This didn't remind me of a peach pie, but it was still very good.

I used actual lowfat vanilla yogurt that I froze last night, as I wanted to use 
what I had on hand without spending out more money. I didn't want to use vanilla wafers to cut back on calories.

Very good. Tasty and filling. I will make this again often. Peaches and yogurt are cheap this time of year.
