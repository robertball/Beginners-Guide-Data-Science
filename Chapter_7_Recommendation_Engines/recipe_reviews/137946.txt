This was my first time making risotto and it came out just perfect! I added mushrooms  instead of carrots though and crushed red pepper instead of a minced chile pepper and it was still delicious. Thanks!

I made this the first time I ever made or had risotto. I thought it was delicious. Since, I've had risotto at fine dining restaurants. Mine was every bit as good as theirs. Since I've also made other risotto recipes and I still prefer this one. If I could give it more stars, I would.

Made as instructed, except didn't have chili-garlic butter, so added a little chili powder and garlic with the butter. Also threw in some spinach at the end. Whole family enjoyed it - even the kids.

Well, the rice flavor was great but I wasn't crazy about the flavor combination of the carrots and, especially the black olives. Maybe it would be better with Kalamata olives? I definitely like the idea of spinach and mushroom instead. I agree that a little less butter would probably work fine.

Great Recipe!  Didn't have chili-garlic butter or a fresh chili so added a clove of garlic and a shake of Sweet Chili Sauce!

This was good but I modified it somewhat to enhance the flavor - added thyme, lemon juice, garlic and onion powder, chili powder, and garnished it with paprika and parsley.

Really great recipe. As have others, I made adjustments based on my family tastes. I eliminated the onions, carrots, and black olives. Found out I had no chili pepper halfway through cooking (oops) - used chili powder instead. 

Also added cut up red pepper (about half of one) and mushrooms, topped with a sprinkling on each bowl of fresh shredded parmesan cheese. 

Winner!

The recipe is amazing and delicious. Ideal for my Goan palate - a very nice mixture of wine, sea food and spice.
