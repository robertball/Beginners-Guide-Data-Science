Changed it to whole 12 oz can of evaporated milk and 1 cup water, so creamy and chocolatey.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 c, just a personal preference. I used vanilla AND a tiny dash of rum extract... to those whose did not thicken... did you let it come to a full boil?  No matter how LONG you cook the pudding, it will not thicken unless it comes to a full boil.

YUM!!! Just make sure you use a good tasting cocoa powder. I used Herhsey and it turned out a little strong. perhaps a little less intense cocoa. perhaps a european chocolate.

I followed the recipe and the pudding turned out great!  Super chocolate flavor and creamy.  It tasted great both warm and cooled.  Maybe next time I will try this as a chocolate cream pie filling!

I didn't want to be rating this but commenting in case anyone tries to do what I did. I didn't have enough cocoa so I used 2 oz of unsweetened chocolate squares. I melted it the milk before adding the rest of the stuff and I'd advise against that since adding flour to hot milk doesn't quite turn out smooth pudding. Tastes fine but lumpy. Instead either melt the chocolate in the microwave first and add to the milk, sugar, flour before heating or reserve half the cold liquid to mix with the flour to add after the chocolate melts in the heated liquid.

Excellent rich chocolate flavor. Very sweet and creamy. You have to allow plenty of time to do this though, as mine took nearly 45 minutes to get to a boil over med heat. After mine thickened, I simply poured it into 4 serving bowls and then let it stand til it cooled. No additional stirring or anything. I did grate some milk chocolate shavings over a couple of the bowls for looks. This was just like Great Grandma used to make and now I know how to do it too! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Wonderful pudding!  One suggestion for added success... Slowly stir the liquid ingredients in to avoid lumps and bumps.

This is a really straightforward recipe - easy to do, low-cost ingredients, but it's WAY too sweet.  I followed the recipe to a T since it was the first time.  I'll make it again, but will reduce the sugar to 1/2 or 2/3 of a cup for better balance.  Has great potential as a starter recipe, but will take some tweaking to get right.

Delicious!  I've made this twice and made small changes each time.  The first time I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, which made it really rich.  The second time I used regular powder but used 1 cup coffee and 1 cup water in place of 2 cups water to make it mocha flavored!

Excellent dessert. I agree with a previous poster: be sure to use good quality chocolate. I used Hershey's cocoa powder and followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great, but there's was just something...not exactly right with it. I know for a fact it's the chocolate brand I used though because I've noticed Hershey's been tasting different as of late. (I heard they had changed their formula.) Anyway, I'm definitely going to be using this from now on as my go-to recipe for chocolate pudding. I'm going to try it with Ghiradelli chocolate next time. Thanks a bunch for a simple, yummy treat!

I swear this is some of the best stuff I have ever tasted. I want more!! I added less sugar than what it called for (I always decrease sugar amounts anywhere from 2Tbls to 1/2 cup depending on how much is called for) so it would taste chocolately, not sugary. This is much much better than pudding in the box.

This recipe is very similar to my grandmother's, and I enjoy the "down home" taste!  

I substituted 2% milk for the water and evaporated milk, and had to turn up the heat to medium high to get it to boil.  It came out wonderfully, even so!

Warm and creamy..hits the spot!  Instead of only using 1/2 a can of evaporated milk, I used an entire can and adjusted the water to match.  Extra calories I know, but it was worth it!

Perfect - I used it as filling for chocolate pie for Thanksgiving.  Creamy and smooth I did stir constantly and let it bubble until a bit thick. 
I will keep this one. Thanks

This was easy, thickened up beautifully and initially had pretty good flavor - excellent creamy texture! However, I could really taste the flour in this, and that kind of ruined it for me.

Very rich, very creamy, and very good. I used one 12oz can evaporated milk and one cup strong black coffee. I also increased the cocoa to 3/4 cup and used splenda because I'm trying to cut back on sugar. It worked perfectly. When this batch is gone I'll be making another.

I gave this 4 stars because the pudding tasted good (aside from tasting a little too creamy). The only thing I had wrong with it is the consistency... it's a little too runny for my liking. I prefer pudding to be thicker.

In saying this, I did double my recipe, so perhaps the amount that I was making all at once had a little something to do with it.

I was so excited when I found this recipe as I was trying to find a pudding close to what my grandmother made.  I was totally disappointed.   I bought the most expensive cocoa. I kept cooking it and cooking it and it never got thick.  It has been in my refrigerator for over 24 hours and it is still not thick.  Also it is way too sweet.   My daughter told me the only way to eat it is to use it as a hot fudge for ice-cream.. because it is way too sweet to eat alone.

I had the same problem as some other people in two ways--I brought it to a rolling boil and let it boil for a full minute while stirring and it turned out a little bit soupy.  Also, I found it to be way too sweet--the sugar overpowered the chocolate taste.  If I make it again, I'll perhaps add a bit more flour, let it boil longer, and cut the sugar in half.  One reviewer said they used it as a pie filling and mine would never have served that purpose; way too soupy.  Taste is good, albeit too sweet.

I Love this recipe :) I have made it according to the recipe and in an alternate fashion.   I changed the 2 cups water to evaporated milk and the 3/4 evaporated mile to milk and didn't add any salt. Another twist for me is after it cooled I added 1/2 cup of cream to the pudding and stirred it in :D it was really good. I found that mixing the pudding in my Vita Mix got rid of any lumps before I cooked it.   For the people with chocolate allergies, someone told me you can try carob as a substitute and it should taste pretty good.

This is really good, and just like what we use to mke when I was little and "Jell'o" pudding was an expensive treat. Its a perfect comfort food that will satify anyone from 2yrs old to 102. I don't make it nearly often enough and need to remedy that!  To make this a bit more interesting, I increased the cocoa and added a pak of Starbucks Instant Coffee (Italian roast) to it. Tastes like Mocha and everyone raves about it.  I have a few other flavor combinations in mind to try too-  like peanutbutter, mint or maybe using almond extract instead of vanilla?  Experiment and see what other delicious flavors I can create!

This was soooo good.  Like SHANESMOMMY, I used the whole can of evaporated milk and adjusted the water to suit, but I didn't have any of the other problems with texture that some people had.  I've made it a handful of times now, and I like it best after upping the cocoa-- no specific amount, just more for flavor.  As for serving, we've got a great chocolate mint plant growing in the garden, and a few leaves of that, stirred in at the end of cooking, make for a fabulous flavor.  We also really liked it over angel food cake with sliced strawberries on top!

Ok, I've never made a chocolate pudding that turned out to be.. chocolate syrup. This is super watery, and trust me I cooked it over med-high heat for quite some time, and lots of liquid evaporated already. Guess the syrup will go fine over waffles.

When I couldn't find my favorite chocolate pudding recipe and turned here for help. I thought I was in luck by the many positive reviews, but was disappointed. The mixture did not thicken and lacked "body" and taste.I don't think the combination of evaporated milk and water made it creamy enough. Thankfully, I have since found my favorite recipe again.

I have made this several times now and it's the best chocolate pudding recipe that I have found.  It is smooth and creamy and I love the velvety chocolate taste.  This is definitely a keeper!

Very yummy.  Hubby is a pudding eater (usually the instant box kind) and was very impressed.  Mine thickened up very well - almost too much, but I think I went a little heavy on the flour.

This was very good and very chocolatey.  I'll never buy boxed again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Unfortunately, we really didn't like this pudding.  It needed to be a bit creamier, and the cocoa taste just didn't seem to be the right proportion for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I think the amount of vanilla should be 1 tsp, not 1 Tbsp. I substituted mint extract instead of vanilla and used 1 Tbsp without thinking it through. It was a strong as eating toothpaste! I salvaged it by making another plain batch with 1 tsp vanilla to mix together. 

I also made several other substitutions: used whole wheat flour and rye flour, used half cacao and half carob powder, and used half sugar half stevia liquid.  The plain batch turned out nice and chocolaty and plenty sweet.

pretty good. however, i  couldnt get the pudding to thicken! it thickened a tiny bit but not enough to call it pudding. i ended up using it as fondue.
