7.3.18 The cherries and lemon flavor are wonderful in these muffins. Texture is OK but I didn t get much rise on the muffins even though I filled the muffin cup 3/4 full. I scaled the recipe in half and did get 12 muffins but would have been happier with 8 or 9 larger muffins. Not a big deal most importantly they did taste good and were plenty tender and moist.
