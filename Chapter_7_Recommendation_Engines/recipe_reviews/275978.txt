It was really good I would probably put an extra apple in the dish just because I love apples. Very easy to put together. I would definitely make again.

I made some minor changes ....(made it for one)

1 tsp olive oil
1 leek
Added 1/3 fennel bulb

Roasted vegs/Apple in oil for 20 minutes. 

Then added 1/4 cup brown rice and 1/2 cup chicken stock 

Put boneless skinless seasoned chicken breast on top and continued baking for another 40 minutes (chicken was still partially frozen). 

It was tasty (not spectacular) and healthy.

The only additional comment I'd make is to baste the chicken periodically to brown the skin.  We ate this for 3 days straight and my husband, who's picky, loved it.

I donâ€™t care for rosemary, so I used thyme.  It was fairly good.
