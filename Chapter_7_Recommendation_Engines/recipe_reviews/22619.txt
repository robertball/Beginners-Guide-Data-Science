This is a wonderful fruit salsa.  I noticed another reviewer said the person submitting this recipe didn't know what salsa was and what it was supposed to taste like.  I think the reviewer doesn't know what you're supposed to do with FRUIT salsas.  This is wonderful on pork chops and chicken from the grill.  This is NOT salsa to dip your chips in!  Wonderful flavor, great way to use up the abundance of wonderful fresh local peaches on my kitchen counter.

Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this recipe in 2004 and canned it. I cut the sugar and added hot peppers. We really like it and I will make it again this year. We like it with chips.

When I went on vacation at Rhode Island to visit my best friend, She was serving this salsa and it is the best salsa I have ever tasted! I wish I could rate it infinity!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I replaced pears with nectarines and added lots of chopped fresh hot peppers to make it spicy and it turned out great.  Awesome on crackers, fish or chicken!!!

Good Recipe! Only added 3 Cups of sugar. Next time I will try 2. Just a little to sweet for me.

I thought this was a great dish! The only thing I changed was I didn't add the green bell pepper because I'm not too crazy about that taste. I could have used more peaches for more peach flavor and next time I'll be adding some jalapenos or some hot banana peppers for a little zip. I served this over grilled chicken and rice.

My mom and I make this salsa occasionally and I was surprised to find the same recipe on this site.  We add jalepenos for kick (no seeds) and a few less pears.  I love sweet salsa, not hot or spicy, so this recipe is great!  She says fresh peaches/pears are best, but we've also used canned and I can't tell the difference.

This is exactly what I was looking for - however I will omit the pears (just don't want them) and change the green pepper for red (personal taste). I plan to can it since I have an abundance of peaches to use..and I plan to eat most of this with tortilla chips!  I noticed there are no customized versions of this! Great job Auntylene!

Glad I found this peach/tomato salsa recipe. I cut it in half. Great recipe. Great for summer meats off the grill.

I loved this, however, I did change it up a bit, I reduced the sugar to 2 2/3 C It is still plenty sweet. I omited the pears and added apples, I love adding aples to salsa is thickens the salsa. So I used 6 Peaches and 5 apples. I added 3 garlic pieces chopped and I did not use the pickling spice.  My Family loves it and I bottled it and got 11 pints. Great with crackers and chips and  to cook with. Wonderful to put a pint over a pork roast in the crock pot.

This is a very sweet salsa.  I would make it again with a reduced amount of sugar.  I would also add jalapeno to give it a zippier taste.  We canned the end product.

I think this recipe is more of a chutney than a salsa. After I made this (I did cut it into fourths), I added some drained pureed tomatoes with green chilles, cilantro, and cumin. It made it more salsa like to me.

This is my first time at making homemade salsa and it turned out sooo good!  It smelled great during the cooking time and tasted even better chilled.  Others have said it really isn't a dipping salsa but I had it with corn chips and it was delicious. I'm not used to so much prep work (I'm new to all this fresh cooking stuff) but it is so well worth it.  I cut the recipe in half because I didn't really need a whole gallon of salsa but I will make the whole batch next time and save it.

This salsa is very similar to my grandmother's chili sauce, which is legendary in my family.  Well worth the effort.  It has inspired me to invest in some canning equipment and make another batch before we wave a sad farewell  to peaches and tomatoes this year.  It's THAT good!

My family absolutely loves this fruit salsa. We have it with tortilla chips, with crackers, with pork and chicken. I substituted the pears with fresh pineapple and added a finely chopped Hungarian pepper (super hot..at least for me)for just enough heat. Excellent!
