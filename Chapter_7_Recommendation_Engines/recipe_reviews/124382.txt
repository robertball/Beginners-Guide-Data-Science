This was way too much "tomato" for me, and not enough "chili". It wasn't inedible by any means, I ate it, but would not make it again.  Thanks though.

I cut the recipe in half and still used the original quantity for spices.  I also added 1 1/2 TBS cumin and  1/4 tsp. red pepper.  Omitted the tomatoe sauce to keep a thicker consistency. This is a very mild chili.  A good basic recipe.

thought it was perfect...I personally like a lot of stewed tomatoes in my chili so I used two cans of those instead. I put shredded cheddar, onions, and sour cream on top and served :)

Very good.  I added a couple of Bay Leaves and let it simmer about 3 hours.  I also used one 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of chili beans.  Even our pickiest eater liked it.

I made chili for the first time tonight and decided to use this recipe. I used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes and 1 can or regular tomatoes. This turned out very bland I had to add at least 3x the spices for it to taste like something. Good basic recipe I'll have to experiment with it and make it my own.

I didn't follow the recipe (no celery or peppers and substituted chopped garlic instead of the powder) exactly but I'll give credit where credit is due. Thanks for the recipe!

If you are looking for a classic chili recipe this is the one to pick. Not too spicy but lots of flavor. My husband added a little extra pepper to his to spice it up since he likes things hotter than me, but overall it was really really good.

Excellent.  I browned the ground beef and vegies on the grill in a wok.  Put all the ingredients in a crock pot and cooked for 8 hours.  Yummy!  I like a lot of beans in my chili so will add another can the next time I make it.

This was a wonderful classic chili recipe. It was mild enough for my toddlers to enjoy but tasty enough to be my husbands favorite. I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the celery.

This chili came out perfect! I used mostly ground turkey and just a little bit of ground beef, to make it healthier. I didn't have the Worcestire sauce so I left that out. You just have to keep adding a little of this and a little of that for seasonings, and tasting until you get it just right. I always serve my chili over yellow rice, and then top it with some grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream. DELISH!

I have been looking for a different chili recipe than the one I always use. I must say this chili was delicious! Instead of chopping tomatoes I used a can of Rotel w/ habeneros for that extra spice and it turned out great!

This was a excellent starting point for me to make an AWESOME Chili!.  Here's the modifications that I used:

1 lb italian sausage
1.5 lb 93% lean ground beef
2 cans tomatoes with garlic/olive oil
2 cans chili beans instead of kidney beans
Sautee'd the green pepper, onion with minced garlic.  Omitted oregano.  

Mixed in 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce in with the meat as it cooked and then remaining in the chili.  

Also I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Oh my heavens! It was SOOOOOOOOO good!  My 2 yr old loved it!  

Also I omitted the water, left the liquid in the chili beans and let it simmer all afternoon.  Perfect for a NFC championship night game!

I made this chili exactly by the recipe (with the omission of meat) and found the flavor to be quite bland. I do not like spice at all but I didn't expect it to be so bland. I pretty much doubled all the spices in the recipes, which ended up being a perfect compromise. I omitted the meat so added more vegetables such as carrots and some mushrooms cut up very small. All in all I will keep this in my rotation.

This chili was pretty good, although a little bland. Could be my fault. I didn't have any bell peppers or celery, so I left that out. I also didn't use as much onion as called for. I left out the oil and instead just cooked the onion with the ground beef. I put all the ingredients in the crockpot and cooked for about 8 hours. I will cook it again.

Good recipe.  thought it was much better than following day.  Might cut down the worchesterchire sause just a little.  It seemed to dominate the taste of this chili a tad too much.

Classic Chili Haiku: "Too tomato-ey. As basic as chili gets. (But not a bad thing.)" So it's a good chili - yes, classic in that it has what one would call the traditional seasonings and ingredients, but I found it to be too watery, w/ heavy tomato tones. My little one gobbled her's up, since it was devoid of spice, but I had to add Sriracha to mine, which, while giving it some heat, didn't mask the major tomato taste, nor make it thicker. I'm still on a neurotic mission to make all of the chili recipes that AR has to offer,

Really is a classic chili, very versatile. It leaves plenty of room for other stuff you want to add to make it your own.

Like previously mentioned, this is a good basic recipe. If you don't like your chili spicy this works well but, in my opinion, too much liquid/tomato. If you use the whole peeled tomatoes, you need to cut them very tiny or you will have huge chunks. It came out quite watery for my likings so I had to play around with the consistancy and added more meat. All in all its a good basic starter, but needs a little "doctoring" to fit certain desires. THANKS!! =D

Good base recipie!  If you really want to ritz up this dish use 2 lbs of sirloin in place of the ground beef.  I also doubled most of the spices, added some bay leaves, and added a heavy pinch of parsley.

Huge success in the flavour department, but I would omit the water as the result was a bit soupy. We had it the second night as chilli dogs.
