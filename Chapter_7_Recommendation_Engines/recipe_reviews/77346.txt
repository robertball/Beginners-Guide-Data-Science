I've been making this exact recipe for 20 years! Now, I triple it, minus 1/3 cup lemon juice (2/3 c.instead of a full cup) and I use two cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of three, to make a 9" x 13" pie.

Also, to reduce the fat,I use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese(Neufchatel),   and use fat-free sweetened condensed milk. My brother-in-law thought I was lying about it being low fat!

My husband has a large family, so we always make one for the holidays. It's also a hit at church potlucks.

The only downside is that I have to make my own graham cracker crust. I usually assign that job to my husband:)

HINT***Knox (unflavored) Gelatin...for those who have problem with pie setting. Mix 1 1/2 to 2 t of it into your fresh squeezed, 1/3 cup of lemon juice & let it stand for 1 minute before incorporating into cream cheese/milk mixture. If you use fresh--crush your pulp or strain it. I've experimented with flour & cornstarch & while both did thicken, it gave pasty-chalky texture to filling. Thus the reason I tried gelatin. It lends no flavor, keeps the creamy texture & you DON'T have to decrease lemon juice which is key for the pies delicious taste. I sometimes add 1 T of fresh grated lemon peel to my filling. You could always add (instead of gelatin) an additional 1/4 cup of cream cheese but I think it cuts the intensity of the lemon juice. The original Kraft/Phildelphia recipe calls for putting the Cherry Pie Filling on top of whole pie but I believe this aids in the filling not setting well enough for clean slicing. I think it's just too heavy & wet a topping for a cream-type pie. It also makes pie look terrible after a few days (leaking). Anyway, I've always diplored that part of the pie. I HATE, Yuck, HATE that gooey, gelatinous glop of 'over processed' mess. Did I forget to say I hate that stuff?. I prefer thawed sweetened strawberries, frozen cherries or fresh strawberries macerated in sugar & a large dash or two of Grand Marnier. Whatever topping you choose, try spooning over individual slices instead...gelatin or not. But gelatin will give solid slicing. Promise.

This turned out terrible like soup I left it in the fridge over night it never firmed up I didn't have lemon juice so I made it with out thinking it would only affect the flavor not the consistency but may be that was the problem. Also the batter was room temp when I poured it into the crust

I, too, have been making this pie for years.  My husband always asks for this for his "birthday cake", so once a year it is served with candles on top!  To change it up, I make the pie according to the recipe (in a graham crust), but top it with an assortment of sliced fresh fruit.  Just start on the outside of the pie making a circle of one kind of fruit, and work your way to the middle using different fruits.  Strawberries, kiwi, red grapes (cut in half, and canned mandarin slices are my favorites.  It looks beautiful and your guests will be so impressed - just don't tell them how easy it was!

Such a yummy pie! Great with the cherries, fantastic without them. Terrific with fresh strawberries on top or with fresh peaches on the bottom. Really good in a baked pie shell. Just yummy!

This recipe has been a crowd pleaser in my family for years.  My daughter loves it and makes it every chance she gets.  I like it with blueberry or cherry topping.  Also great without a topping. I've also replaced the lemon juice with lime juice on occasion and is just as good.

I have used this recipe for 20 years. It is fast, never fails, and always tastes wonderful. I have substituted fat-free cream cheese, but it makes a softer pie. The taste is very similar.

This is so quick and yummy and tastes awesome.  I normally would do without the cherry pie filling and substitute something else, but it tasted good over cheesecake.  Thanks

One of the easiest ways to prepare a "no bake" cheesecake.  I opted to keep the pie filling separate for family members to add on their own.  This was a quick, easy, and delicious dessert.

To make sure the filling sets up beat the cheese til it's very smooth and fluffy, then add the condensed milk slowly like a couple of tablespoons at a time and beat til it thickens up before adding more.  Think of it like making whipped cream.

as it is, this recipe is a little bit too rich - i add a carton of cool whip to the recipe. it makes more than a 9" pie will hold, so i take the extra and whip it up with some peanut butter or caramel for apple dip!! huge hit every time i make it.

I have been making this recipe for about 20 years.  It works great and tastes great.  For all the people that said it is runny, you either didn't mix it all together well enough or didn't use enough lemon juice.  I made that mistake once because I didn't have lemon juice and thought it was just for flavor.  That is what makes it firm!  Do not skip that ingredient!  I always take the cream cheese out of the fridge first too and warm it up a bit.  That helps it mix with the other ingredients properly.  Run it in the mixer a little longer too, around 3-5 minutes on a medium mix speed.

I have been making this pie since 1992 and it's the best tasting pie ever.  My brother calls every year to ask how to make it.  It can come out runny if you (a) over mix it with the hand blender, sometimes it's best to hand mix with a spoon when you add the lemon juice OR (b) do not put enough lemon juice, since the lemon juice is the binder that makes it set.

I have used this recipe for 20+ years and it is always a hit.  I do suggest adding nuts, using an oreo pie crust, and topping with fresh fruit.  Yummie!

I have been making this forever and if you don't follow the directions exactly it will runny and soupy. I have been told by two people who I gave the recipe to that this is runny..and I asked if they followed directions and the answer was no....they just dumped everything in...make sure your cream cheese is room temperature too otherwise you may have a difficult time blending it til fluffy.  I tend to use just under 1/3 c of lemon juice so it isn't too tart. And I use bottled lemon juice over the fresh...just my preference because one time I had a slightly bitter lemon I used.  Be forewarned this doesn't hold up at a firm texture @ room temperature like a baked cheesecake...but it's delicious.  I have served this in miniature tart shells w/ a sliver of kiwi or strawberry or a fresh blueberry..

Hubby says 4 stars.  Pretty good.  I froze the pie after I made it and let it defrost in the fridge to prevent the runny mess.  It did help some.  Overall good recipe but next time I will use lemon flavoring instead of the juice to prevent the extra liquid.

I've been making this pie for years...learned it from my mom, who got it from Eagle brand condensed milk years ago. Make no mistake...the lemon juice is ESSENTIAL. The pie won't set up without it! I've found recently it sets up best if I beat the mixture on high for about a minute with the whip attachment on the mixer. So easy! So yummy!

Very quick, easy, creamy and palate pleasing. Perfect for a week night dessert. I would cut down on the lemon juice a tad next time and go with an 8" crust. Thank you!

We use the filling part of this recipe, but use our own pie crust and use fresh peaches that we have enhanced the flavor, thickened and sweetened. See photo for Peach Cream Cheese Pie on fb bakinbill.

Very easy recipe.  The family absolutely loved it. By the end of the night the pie was gone. Will definitely be making this again. I used 2 packages of cream cheese in the recipe and it came out wonderful.

This is my all-time favorite dessert. It has been dessert for many birthdays and Christmases in my family, and it had never failed us. Simply decadent. just make sure you`re patient and wait atleast 4 hours before eating it or else the taste and texture just won`t be as good. Overnight is best.

I set my cream cheese out for a bit so it could soften before using it. I also used fresh lemon juice, homemade graham crust and homemade cherry pie filling. I had no issues with runny pie, but I did read through the reviews before making it. I think that really whipping the cream cheese and milk together makes a difference as well as using fresh lemon juice. We all enjoyed this. It reminds me of a key lime pie I make from this site, texture-wise.

We've made this recipe for  20+ years. For those having trouble doubling the recipe to make the pie a bit "more"  Double only the cream cheese and leave the condensed milk and lemon juice the original measurement. Been doing 2 blocks of cream cheese for years and this seems to be the perfect amount for one pie.

This had great taste, however when we cut into it after several hours in the fridge, the filling was very runny and did not hold up.  If I make this again, I think I would cut the lemon juice back to 1/4 cup to avoid this from happening again.

Pretty good recipe! I let it set overnight and followed the recipe exactly and it still does not cut out of the pan perfectly. It wasn't runny but it wasn't cheesecake consistency either like the picture appears. But my family and I enjoyed it and will definitely make again!

I doubled this recipe in order to make two pies, and decreased the lemon juice by half to avoid tartness. My pies ended up runny, did not keep shape at all. I'm not sure if this is due to doubling the recipe. Also, the taste was way too sweet. Will not try again.

This was a party favorite. I made my own cherry topping though, those canned ones come with too many unnatural ingredients for me. I've been making this eagle brand cheesecake since I was a kid. I love the lemony flavor.

After I beat the cream cheese and added the sweetened condensed milk, I could tell it was too runny and wouldn't set.  I dissolved some knox gelatin in the lemon juice, but even that didn't set the filling.  I know this is an old favorite recipe, so I must've done something wrong...

This is a good recipe whose real virtue is ease of preparation.  I use it when I need a treat for a group, like work or a club meeting, and I don't feel like cooking.  There are never any leftovers.  Be sure to follow directions and put topping on at serving time.

Awesome recipe!  Very tasty, slightly on the rich side, but as long as you have a small piece it is fine.  I have been making this for years, my mother introduced me to it.  A quick tip if you are having trouble with it setting: are you using fresh lemon juice or from a bottle?  I have made it twice with lemon juice from a bottle and it did not set correctly.  All the other times I made it with fresh lemon juice it has turned out perfectly!

This was very good. I am giving 5 stars not just for flavor but also for simplicity. I followed the recipe precisely and didn't have any problems. The only thing I did differently was put it in a 9x9 baking dish and thought it was a better system since it seemed more like a "dessert" rather than a pie, and since it is so rich it is easier to cut/serve smaller pieces.

We call this pie a "Cherry-Oh-My Pie".  It is a tradition for birthdays and holidays in our family.  It's best in a graham cracker crust.  Be sure to mix well the milk and cream cheese before adding the lemon juice and vanilla.

This did not firm up after 6 hours. Eventually, I put in the freezer and that did the trick! Great taste, but will use slightly less lemon juice and buttermilk to see if this will help with the consistency.

I've made it twice, and it was just about perfect when I went easy on the lemon juice.  A third cup is a little too tart.

This was so simple.. I had many people for dinner so I just changed the amount and instead of one pie, I serve it in mini grahm cracker pie crusts with raspberry topping. perfect because you can make ahead and enjoy friends and family.

Forget the graham cracker crust, use a regular pie crust studded with roasted pecan bits before baking the crust.

Good and easy recipe. For more cheese flavor, I added another 4 oz of cream cheese (half a block). Worked out great...

Love this. Been making this for years. So easy and no baking! I leave the topping off until Im about to serve - my fave is cherry pie filling. I also add about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of almond extract stirred into the cherry pie filling before I put it on top. Gives it a little bit more flavor. YUM.

This recipe has been in my family for over 20 years. It is easy to make and delicious. If you are making it for the first time, follow the directions to a T. With so few ingredients, omitting or changing one thing could ruin it. 
When I make it, I double the recipe and cut the lemon juice back to 1/2 c. I also whip it on high with my kitchenaid for roughly 10 minutes. I have no problems with it not turning out.

I have used this recipe for years. Haven't changed a thing and I use a variety of pie fillings. My husband loves the standard cherry topping.

Our family loves this cheesecake. It is easy to make and tastes so good. We have it at all of your family get togethers. We have also tried adding Boysenberry filling instead of Cherry filling and that tastes great also.
