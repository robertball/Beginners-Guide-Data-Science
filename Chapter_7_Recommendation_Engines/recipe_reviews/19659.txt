Such an easy recipe and went over great at our church XMAS fellowship.  I used 3 lbs. kielbasa instead of 2 and it was wonderful. Just for reference, 3 lbs. made about 100 bite size pieces.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks.

Couldn't be easier to make--although I would used 1 can of cranberry sauce next time, instead of two.  Everyone loved them.

Very easy. I halved the recipe and made it in the crock pot on low for a couple of hours. Previous review was on the money, the longer it cooks the better it tastes. I suggest 4-6 hours on low in Crock pot. I used a brown sugar BBQ sauce -came a little more sweet than I thought it would but that was my fault in choosing the BBQ sauce.

This got RAVE reviews at the party I took it to.  I used 2 lbs turkey kielbasa- 1 can of regular cranberry sauce, 1 bottle Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce- and a few shakes of chipolte tabasco.  It was really good- really easy- and pretty good in terms of Weight Watchers points.  Thanks!

I made this for my son's 18th birthday were I had 25 hungry teens to feed. Tripled the recipe and there was not even a drop of the sauce left. Served it with New England style buns(Top Split) with coleslaw, sauerkraut and curly fries for sides. Even the girls were wolfing this down! I've already been asked to make this for several graduation parties this spring. I simmered it for 1 hour before the kids arrived and left it on low as the party progressed (about another 2 hours). The next day three of the other moms called to ask for the recipe! Made a smaller version the next week at the request of the rest of the family and again not a drop was left . It is seldom that I find a recipe that I don't have to adjust other than for quantity but this is one. This is definately one that I will be using for years to come at all types of gatherings and for "just us" meals.

This was so good and so easy!  I made it for a Superbowl party and it was a big hit!  Like the description says, the longer it simmers, the better!  I let mine cook for about 3 hours and they tasted great!  Will definitely make again!

Made last year for X-Mas appetizer. Went over so well, and nice to have on hand in the crock pot so it stays warm and you can walk away. Already had requests to make it this year. Thanks for the recipe.

A great recipe for boys night out, Kimberly! My hubby and his buds have a "BOYS ONLY" night out a couple times a month. He prepared this himself (my suggestion because I was too busy)and did a great job. I got to taste before he took it away. The kielbasa is a tasty change from the tired old meatball.....Thanks so much.

I made this recipe tonight and it was very well received.  I served the sausages on toothpicks with slices of pineapple, which pair well with the sweetness of the sauce.  This review is only 4 stars because some tasters felt that the sauce was too sweet for their palates.  A spicier sausage or the addition of red pepper flakes or hot sauce to the mix would add a little kick to balance the sugar.

Gosh, I don't know how to rate this.   The bbq sauce ruled the taste but I guess that's what you get with bbq sauce.  I served this over white rice after letting it sit in the crock pot for 4 hours and everyone enjoyed it.  I said I wasn't going to make this again but I think I might, with a different bbq sauce.

This was super easy and allowed me to prepare other dishes while this was in the slow-cooker. I used 3 lb. of skinless kielbasa, and switched up the ingredients a bit, per other viewer's suggestions. I put about 1 cup of grape jelly and 2 -12 oz. bottles of Bennett's chili sauce in the crock pot. I browned the sliced kielbasa nicely and just dropped it in the crock and walked away for 3 hours. It tasted awesome! It served about 100 pieces or so. They went over VERY well for a Christmas eve appetizer :)

I have taken this to a few parties and it's always a hit--especially with the men. I use a tangier, spicy sauce instead of anything sweet since the cranberry sauce is sweet enough. Another variation I tried from my mother-in-law is a jar of grape jelly and 2 bottles of Heinz chili sauce instead of the bbq sauce and cranberries.

Tasty! I made this with Open Pit bbq sauce, and it gave it a nice sweet and spicy flavor. Also, since I was making it just for me, the recipe was mostly cut in half, but added a little more bbq sauce. Will make this again.

Very good!  Not a piece leftover!  Instead of two packages of kielbasa, I used only one and also a package of small cocktail weinies.  I only used 1 can of whole cranberry sauce.  If you prefer a sweeter taste, you may want to stick with both cans though.

I used  real cranberries. I cooked 1 bag of cranberries, 1 cup sugar,1 cup orange juice,1 cinnamon stick, 3 cloves, and 1 star anise over medium heat until bubbling. Turn to simmer for 15 minutes. Take out cloves and cinnamon stick. Slice 2 lbs of uncooked kielbasa in 1/4" slices. Mix 1/2 bottle of regular barbecue sauce into cranberries and then mix in kielbasa. Bake at 325 for 1 hour or in crockpot on low indefinitely. So much better than canned.

I definitely left mine in the slow cooker too long, but they weren't done after an hour. I'll try it again and keep a better eye on it.

I had to make some changes for what I had on hand which was smoked sausage and appricot preserves. Next time, I think it will be even better with the kielbasa but I think I'll keep the apricot preserves.


***Update to clarify my review - I used the apricot preserves in place of the cranberry sauce.  This did not replace the barbecue sauce, which I did use.

nice easy recipe.  I've also made by  using a bottle of chili sauce in place of bbq, and used  the jellied cranberry and added the juice of one lemon.

I did not care for this at all and I do love kielbasa, just combination that did not taste good to me. Thanks for the post, though.

I made this today and it was a hit. I added some thickly sliced granny smith apples into it and they were DELICIOUS with the kielbasa and the cranberries. Will definitely make again.

The flavor of these was great. They were a hit. Personally I didn't love the chunks of cranberries in the whole berry sauce, but I can't imagine that jelled cranberry (the kind that comes out looking like the can) would work as well? I've made it twice now (the second time by request)==== Update: Make with the whole berries now. Exactly as written. Requested regularly.

I let it marinate for ~3 hours in the slow cooker and it came out great! My husband wants me to put it into our meal rotation. I have no problem with that as it is a quick and easy midweek meal!

It was ok, I think this recipe depends largely on the type of barbeque sauce you use.  We used sweet baby ray's Honey BBQ sauce and 1/2 the amount of cranberries, and it was good, but not amazing.  Also, I served it with rice for a normal dinner, and even with the same flavors it might have been better as a "toothpick" party appetizer (which is what it's designed for!)

Made this for a potluck last Saturday.  I used one can of cranberry sauce and a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Spicy and Sweet sauce. I cut up two Hillshire Farms kielbasas.  I had a turkey and their hardwood smoked chicken (my favorite) in my freezer so I used both.  I got great compliments!  Thanks!

I had saved this and "party kielbasa", and when I went to make one of them, I was "scared off" by a bad review of "party kielbasa".  Glad I tried this one...was a hit @ a party we had over the weekend.  Easy to make as well.  My husband and my mom were looking for leftovers the next day!

It’s very flavorful. The key here is using good quality BBQ sauce (18oz) that’s not too sweet. I used 1LB kielbasa & 1 LB of ground turkey; cooked “low” in slow cooker for 7hrs instead of 3-4hrs (since I added raw ground turkey straight to slow cooker). Highly recommend adding the ground turkey which brought out more texture and flavor. Even with decreasing to 1 can of whole cranberry sauce and adding 2 med onions, 1 large potato, and 2/3 cabbage (all chopped), it turned out still slightly overly sweet. But very tasty that I would do it again with more tweaking. Would recommend serving over plain rice/pasta/grits/polenta/quinoa. Best of all, it is a very easy recipe.

I wanted something different to do with polish sausage and this was it. Very simple recipe and by far very good! I went on what others advised and put only one can of cranberry sauce and did a honey BBQ sauce with it. It turned out awesome. I made it on the stove because I was running out of time. I let them simmer for an hour and they soaked up all the flavors. Thank you so much for this simple and very good recipe!

This came out really great!  Made it to bring to a pot luck at the senior center and they all loved it.  I used three pounds instead since I had plenty and there was still enough sauce for that amount of meat.  So easy to do!

Can't get much easier and the flavor is fantastic!  The cranberries are genius!  They give just the right amount of tang.  I used deer sausage and KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.

The only changes i made were because i didnt have a large enough pan. You can do the same thing just boil all of it in a pot on the stove for about  a half hour and add canned mushrooms. Serve with White Rice on the side and it comes out the same! Very good!

Used 3, 250g packages of turkey kielbasa, and only 1 can of cranberries, and BBQ sauce to taste (about 1/2 bottle). There weren't none left, and my daughter took a bowl of the sauce  to eat!!!!

It sounds like an odd combination but the I used whole cranberry sauce and a bottle of bbq sauce and it was fabulous.  Ive since used the same sauce to slow cook turkey breast and pork tenderloin.

If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. Cut my recipe in half- that's my only change. Delicious!
