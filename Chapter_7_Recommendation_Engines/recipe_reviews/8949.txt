I never made chicken spaghetti before so I researched a lot of recipes on this site and elsewhere. This recipe is the one I kept coming back to...BUT here's how I ended up making Chicken Spaghetti:
Boil 2 split breasts with water, carrots, onions, celery, garlic, bay leaf, salt & pepper. Remove the breasts, strain & de-fat the broth. Ladle about a cup of broth into a bowl; set aside. Pour the rest of the broth back into pot & set aside.  Skin and debone the breasts when they're cool enough to handle. Chop the meat into bite size pieces; set aside. Bring the broth (and more water if needed) to a boil & cook the pasta per pkg. directions. Return drained, rinsed pasta to pot; set aside. Saute 1 c. each chopped onions and bell peppers in 1 - 2 T. butter till soft. Add 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can mild Rotel tomatoes, 2 c. shredded Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese, season to taste with garlic powder, salt, & pepper. If consistancy is too thick add some of the reserved broth. Stir in the chopped chicken. Pour mixture over pasta and stir till well blended. Transfer all to a casserole dish, bake in preheated 350 degree oven 10 to 15 minutes, sprinkle with shredded cheese, and continue baking 15 more minutes or till bubbly.
Note: 1 spilt breast yields about 1-1/2 c. of chopped meat.

This was fantastic! I did make the following adjustments: I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and I used chicken broth instead of the wine. Super easy, makes lots, and improves with age!

My family enjoyed this casserole. I did have to make a few changes to suit our needs though. I used cream chicken soup instead of mushroom, a can of drained rotel tomatoes since I was out of bell pepper, and substituted chicken broth for the wine. It came out really good! The tomatoes added good color and flavor.

June2008- I made this recipe again today...  but didn't have any white wine or whiskey so I thought I would try the chicken broth (as suggested by others). I have to tell you.... it was a disappointment. If you haven't tried whiskey is this dish... you are missing an extra star! It is FABULOUS!! Be brave! Give it a try!!!

I had to make adjustments based on what I had in the kitchen. Only used green peppers, substituted onion flakes and used whiskey instead of white wine (as suggested by another reviewer). Plus I did add the garlic powder to spice it up...... garlic in everything I say!! All in all, my husband and I had never had spaghetti and chicken before, but LOVED IT and have found a new way to enjoy spaghetti!!

I made this again tonight and it was still WONDERFUL!! I used a whole bell pepper and sauted it and a clove of minced garlic in  2 T. Archer Farms (Target) Roasted Garlic and Herb EVOO just for extra flavor for a few minutes while the spaghetti noodles were cooking. I omited the onion since hubby doesn't like onion and used two cans of cream of mushroom soup from the other reviewers. I'm glad I used two cans because other wise I think it would have been too dry. Instead of the 1/4 c white wine I used 1/2 c chicken broth just to have a little more liquid. I also boiled the chicken breasts for 30 minutes, took them out and added the spaghetti to the "chicken water" so it would give it more flavor too. I baked it covered for the first amount of time and uncovered once I put the cheese on top. I will defiantely make this again! Thank you for the recipe and the other reviewers suggestions.

This is really good.  This dish is also a favorite..but of the women in my family...hahaha!!  We added mushrooms (which I don't care for)but did that for the sake of others.  And I prefer chicken broth over white wine.  When we have large get-togethers we like to make a big batch of chicken spaghetti and a batch of regular spaghetti (for those die-hard red sauce people).  There's usually not much chicken spaghetti left after the evening is over. Great Job Marty!!

This has become our favorite recipe. It's SO good and makes great leftovers. Everyone I make it for loves it. I always saute the onion and bell pepper to soften them before mixing with the rest of the ingredients.

Update 1/30/12: I have made this several times & have started adding 1/2 a can of white wine & 1/2 a can of milk. It gives it great flavor!! 
This was a great start for the recipe. I boiled chicken tenders in water & 1 chicken bouillion cube & diced them. I substituted a can of original Rotel in place of the onion, bell pepper and pimento. I also used 1/2 cup of chicken broth in place of the white wine. I added diced black olives for color and they added a great flavor! Very creamy & flavorful!

I made this for my men (husband and 15 yr old son) & they absolutely LOVED it.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  I used 2 pounds of raw chicken, cubed, a full box of whole grain spaghetti, no pimentos or green bell peppers because I was out of both, 3 - 4 cloves finely sliced garlic & 1 medium onion finely chopped instead of 1/2 cup chopped, 1 10.75 oz can cream of chicken soup and 1 can diced tomatos IN ADDITION TO the 1 10.75 oz can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of 1/4 cup white wine & 1 cup 2% shredded mozzerella cheese & 1 cup 2% shredded cheddar cheese instead of 2 cups shredded cheddar only.  I cooked the spaghetti noodles completely, not only al dente (matter of taste there).  I cooked the cubed chicken until it was completely cooked.  I sauted the onions and garlic in about 2 tbsp butter until they were soft and fragrant.  I drained the liquid off the noodles and the can of diced tomatoes.  I poured everything (except the cheese) into a non-stick-cooking-spray-coated glass 13x9 inch pan (everything listed perfectly fills it).  I made sure to stir everything up so that it was all kind of equally mixed together.  Then I sprinkled the 2 cups of cheese across the top and covered it with aluminum foil.  I baked it for exactly 30 minutes.  Took it out and removed the foil.  My men loved it and it was SOOO easy to make it a really healthy dish (2% cheese, fat free cream soups, fat free chicken broth instead of wine, whole wheat whole grain spaghetti)

Really good!  My husband and I made this together.  We live overseas and couldn't get the cream of mushroom or chicken soup, so we substituted it with 1 cup fat free sour cream and 1/3 cup cream cheese.  Tasted SO good and had fewer calories.

This was pretty good.  Mine did not seem to get as creamy as the picture though. Only change is I did not add black pepper.  And, to stop it from getting to dry I edited the cook time to 20 min. added the cheese than an additional 10 keeping an eye on it.

The best help for this recipe is from Deb from Houston if you scroll down. I took some shortcuts as I just added a chicken Boullion cube to the spaghetti water and I heated the frozen cooked chicken I had on hand in the hot stock water after the pasta cooked. I made my own cream of mushroom soup since I live overseas. If you dont have soup or you cant get it here is the recipe: 1/2 c milk and 1/2 cup cream mixed in glass measure cup. Add one chicken boullion cube for cream of chicken soup. I add extra garlic red pepper if I am making a mexican dish. If I need cream of mushroom I add 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms and some black pepper and some granulated garlic. Then heat the milk mixture in microwave until hot. Add 1/4 c. water mixed with 2Tbsp. corn starch and heat until thickened. This is the perfect substitute for all those expensive cream soups and is VERY tasty!!

This recipe was a big disappointment.  Tasted like "cream of" mush.  Thank goodness it was cheap to make.  Sorry, but it is bad when the replacement food your family wants is Top Ramen and canned Clam Chowder...

I had some leftover chicken and I came across this recipe and decided to try it!! It was very good.  I didn't have any green peppers or pimento so I used red bell pepper.  I as well didn't have any wine, so instead I used chicken broth.  It turned out very well.  I baked the first 30 min covered and the last 15 min uncovered with the added cheese on top.

I don't usually like to rate recipes if I changed something in it but I thought this might be helpful - I added about 1/2cup chicken broth so it wouldn't be so dry. It came out so good even my 6yr. old loved it. Thank you for the recipe Sumchelle :)

Great stuff!  I left out the green peppers (hubby doesn't like them) and it was still really good.  I recommend breaking the spaghetti into small (2 inch?) pieces before cooking to make it easier to mix.

I thought the onions were too crunchy after the initial baking time.  I added more wine, stirred it, and baked it longer, then added the cheese topping.  It's good, and my husband really liked it.

I sauteed the onions, bell peppers and added sliced mushrooms until they were soft, before I blended everything with the soup and noodles.  The mixture seemed a little dry, so I also put in some milk, about 1/3 cup, to loosen up the mixture. I covered the casserole while it was baking,so it would not dry out.  I have also prepared it with 1/3 c. sour cream, which makes it a bit creamier.  A touch of Lawry's seasoning salt also adds extra flavor.

I like it, the wine makes this otherwise basic casserole extra tasty.  A new reason to keep wine in the fridge!

This recipe was delish! It was the first time I had ever made Chicken Spaghetti.  I like others substituted chicken broth for white wine and used much more than what the recipe called for.  I chopped up two portabello mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and bell peppers.  I kind of felt that after adding them I could leave out the chicken for a great vegetarian option.  But I went ahead and added the chicken as it was already cooked.  I added about a cup and a half of velveeta in the mix and another cup and a half of cheedar outside.  I really recommend adding a can of cream of chicken.  I boiled my chicken with 2 bay leaves and about 2 teaspoons of peppercorns.  They both added a lot to the chicken.  Nothing bland here and nothing dry.  Great meal!  My hubby can't wait for me to make it again!

This is a crowd-pleaser! I substituted cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom and velveeta cheese for 1/2 of the cheddar (velveeta in the chicken-spaghetti mixture, cheddar on top). I sauteed the onions and green peppers in a tiny bit of olive oil first. We loved the white wine, so used the full amount, but  I added a bit of chicken broth to thin the mixture before it went in the oven -- it looked a bit thick without the added broth. We had a house-full of guests with unknown food preferences -- everyone loved it. This recipe is perfect when guests are coming, not fancy but very tasty and filing. It can be made ahead and popped in the oven at dinner time, so more time with company and less time freaking out. I'm a fan and will definitely make again. Thanks so much!

This was delicious! I added a little more onions and peppers and sauteed them before adding to casserole. I also cooked the spaghetti in the broth from the chicken that I stewed, then used the broth instead of the wine in the casserole. Also used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. Could have used a little more seasoning, but all in all...it was excellent! Will make again.

MMMMMmmmmm!  I searched for a chicken spaghetti that did not use a big block of processed cheese and this fit the bill.  I did not have pimento peppers so I used a can of tomatos with green chiles.  My husband loves to have lots of veggies in every dish so I added mushrooms and fresh spinach.  I've even made this with wheat noodles and tuna instead of chicken.  Very tasty dish.  I did feel like this needed garlic so I added a dash of garlic  powder as I mixed everything up.

I used what I had on hand, but this would have been great even if I didnt change anything. It is so adaptable to whatever you have around the house. I used onion and celery sauteed in some butter and added that to a can of cream of chicken soup, 1/4 cup milk, the cooked pasta and cooked chicken, and about 1 cup of shredded italian blend cheese. I seasoned with salt pepper garlic and celery. I added a little more of the cheese on top. I cant wait to go home and eat the leftovers for lunch!

My family really likes this recipe too.  The only suggestion I have is to change it up using Velveeta cheese.  This is very easy to make and it's always a hit at potluck dinners.

I microwaved with the Cheddar on top for 4 minutes on high, then topped with grated Parmesan & baked for 15 minutes to brown.  This meal is versatile & tasty! *Added mushrooms & peas, omitted pimento & replaced wine with chix stock.

When I first read the review, I thought, how odd that men seem to like this dish.  But, in my case, it proved to be true too.  My husband loved it!  Modifications: I added some sliced mushrooms and sauteed with the green peppers and onion before adding to chicken/spaghetti mixture.  Added extra can of cream of mushroom soup based on other reviews saying too dry.  I added all of the cheddar cheese to mixture and for the topping I made a crushed cornflake/parmesan cheese mixture that I only exposed during last 15 minutes of cooking (kept covered under foil until then). Definitely will remake!

This was good but next time I will use Velveeta in the mixture then sprinkle the top with cheddar.  It definitely needs garlic.

This is a recipe with loads of potential - my family loved this (they like pasta!) but, the cheese is wrong.  Next time I will use a much softer tasting cheese like mozzarella, as cheddar is too strong and overpowered the other ingredients, and in fact made the recipe too rich! However, I will substitute the cheese and definitely make this again!

We loved this casserole! Easy, filling and good! In a rare moment, we are out of green bell peppers so I just added another jar of diced pimentos.  Also, I used onion flakes and cream of chicken (only because that is all I had available...it's time to go grocery shopping!). Be sure to add the wine, it enhances the taste of the casserole and is really subtle! Will make this again!! Thanks Marty!!

I made this for my guy friend for his birthday, and he LOVED it! Begged me to make it again. I changed it a bit, instead of wine I used whiskey (we're not big wine drinkers), I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, omitted the onion and pepper and used onion powder instead, and added a teaspoon of garlic powder.

This dinner wasn't bad but it lacked seasoning.  Salt and pepper wasn't enough.  Maybe some cajun spice or hot sauce.  I'm not sure if I would make this again. Michele, ontario

My family absolutely loved this.  This was my first time making chicken spaghetti. Here are the changes I made: On advice from previous reviewers, I substituted cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom.  I actually used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  I also used a can of drained rotel instead of the peppers.  I sauteed mushrooms, onion, and minced garlic and added it as well. Definitely a keeper in my household!

My mother in law taught me how to make this...  she puts in pecans and Rotel tomatoes and it definitely adds flavor. I no longer use the cream of mushroom soup because the casserole turns out gray and look unappetizing, I use cream of chicken, I also don't recommend cooking it in a metal pan for the same reason. Our family loves it and its good to share if you need to take a dish somewhere.

I added celery and fresh mushrooms.  I also sprinkled fresh chopped Italian parsley on top before I put the cheddar on.  A wonderful flavor packed casserole.  Will keep in my comfort food file.

This was a pretty good recipe for use of leftovers I had in the fridge. We had some battered pork chops earlier in the week, and "Kings Dish" budget recipe the other day (angel hair, eggs and parma cheese). I used cream of chicken soup, mixed it with half a can of Rotel, juice and all, 1 cup of shredded cheddar jack. Added the leftover pasta and cubed pork. Poured it in a casserole dish and topped it with remaining cheese. My family ate it all, and my husband asked if there was leftovers for lunch. I would have given it a 5 stars, but I made alot of changes.

I love this recipe! My husband doesn't like green pepper so I usually omit those and the pimento. If I don't have white wine I typically use chicken broth... but the white wine adds a great flavor. I made it for friends and it was gone quickly.

I added more cheese and a little butter.  I cooked it longer so the cheese on top would become crispy.  It was the best part.

This was great! I had only a few ingredients in the house so I made a few changes in the veggie department, and used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  I wouldn't recommend doing this if your chicken isn't already cooked, as it just adds to the overall time.  (It took longer than I thought, but that could be because I'm a novice cook.)  Yummy though!

Very Very bland flavor. I follow the recipe pretty closely except I substituted tomatoes for the pimento pepper and cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom soup. Overall, I did not enjoy this recipe and nither did my husband. I cannot even come up with additions or suggestions to make it better.

Just made this tonight with my sister - I left out the pimento peppers and used chicken broth instead of the wine as other reviewers had mentioned. I used angel hair pasta instead of regular spaghetti and mozzarella rather than cheddar. I liked it, the only thing I would change next time is a little less onion, maybe a quarter cup.

OK, so i'm only giving 4 stars because as written I think this would be a little bland/dry. I used a combination of a few other reviewers changes. I did the can of medium Rotel instead of pimentos, whiskey instead of wine, red bell instead of green, added garlic (not using garlic in our kitchen is a SIN), extra cream of mushroom (to prevent the dry issue) and a few shakes of cajun seasoning. I was skeptical after mixing the sauce with the whiskey (very strong smell), but once it was baked it was AWESOME! My fiance went back for thirds and made sure I wrote down the changes I made. This was fab :)

I made this last night...SUPER YUMMY.  I did make a few changes.  Instead of all cheddar, I used 1/2 cheddar 1/2 pepper jack.  I also added 5 cloves of garlic & threw in that and the onions in with the chicken chunks while it was cooking.  Like one of the other cooks I used 1 can fat free chicken soup & 1 can fat free mushroom soup & used a little more chicken broth instead of wine.  One other thing I used red pepper instead of pimentos.  Would definately make again, maybe adding some kind of veggies.  Very versitile recipe.  Thanks!!

Just made this for work luncheon and not one noodle was left.  I did make a few changes after reading several other reviews.  I used velveeta cheese instead of cheddar and chicken broth instead of white wine.  I also threw in a drained can of rotel and added a pinch of garlic.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  Will defintely make again and again!

One of the better chicken spaghetti casseroles I have tried. I do think the peppers/onions should be slightly cooked before adding it it with everything else, because they came out a little too crunchy.

A really great recipe and easy to put together! I was looking for a quick "the-family-is-coming-over-and-I-haven't-gone-grocery-shopping" rescue recipe and this was it! I did not add the pimentos,green peppers or white wine, didn't have them on hand.  I did add a can of cream of chicken soup and fresh mushrooms. I also had a small box of stewed tomatos that I added.  It fit in a 9x13 and I barely had any left! Tasted Italian with a twist!!  I recommend it to anyone with finicky kids - my neice asked for seconds!

this dish was okay... would have been better if the onions were sauteed before being added to the mixture. even after 40 minutes in the oven, they were still raw and crunchy and overpowered the dish.

This was very yummy. My children were asking for the leftovers! I made a few adjustments simply because I didn't have the pimento pepper, so instead I added mushrooms with the onion and bell pepper and I sauted them all together before adding. I also cooked five chicken breasts in the slow cooker all day and used the broth off of them instead of the wine. It was simply delicious!

I love this recipe!!! I have made it several times and have perfected it to my own taste and family size. I brown my chicken in oil with the onion and bell pepper (I use red), add a clove of garlic minced to the pan as well as some garlic herb seasoning. I make a full box of spaghetti, instead of doubling the soup i add one can cream of mushroom one can cream of chicken and i throw in a can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilles, I also substitute chicken broth for the wine like some other reviewers had suggested. It has been a huge hit everytime. Thank you so much for such a great recipe!!!

Easy & Awesome!  I too didn't have the pimentos or green peppers - substituted tomatoes and green onion instead - as well as the RED onion.  *UPDATE:  This has been made several times, each time I just use whatever I have hangin' around.  So versatile - tastes great with just about anything! Try adding some white wine and Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle.  Wow!! *

Everyone loved it. I lost my recipe so I looked and found this one- liked the wine in it. Only change I made was adding another can of soup- cream of chicken.  I think I added too much spaghetti so that helped to make it creamier- my cooking isn't an exact science - teehee I just throw stuff together till it tastes good.  Will be making again!

I sauteed onions, peppers and fresh garlic first.  Used Cream of Chicken soup (used extra to make it creamier)and added sliced mushrooms; left out pimentos.  I also added a can of Mild Rotel(tomatoes w/ chili peppers) which gave it a nice spicy kick.

Deeeelicious!!!  
thank you for this wonderful recipe, it was quick and easy. 
I made a few changes ,I omitted the pimento peppers and used only one cup of cheddar cheese to blend in and used one cup of mozzarella for the topping. 
The hubby approved and this is definately a keeper.

Excellent! Though I have to agree, the cheddar was a tad bit much. Next time I will use Mild. Didn't use pimentos. Used cream of chicken, and chicken broth instead of wine. My husband loved it.

Yum!! I thought this was very good! I used some good white cheddar and the regular package stuff together. I almast left out the pimento but, it gave it a good flavor.

I made this recipe using all of the mentioned ingredients but made a bit of modifications due to what I had on hand. I used rotel tomatoes, Colby jack cheese, cream of chicken soup and white wine. This was amazing! My husband loved it. He said "this is one of the best meals you've ever made". So glad I decided to make this! And it's super easy too!

I made this tonight for the first time. hubby wanted something different.   found this recipe .. I  made 2 changes.. I used red pepper instead of the pimentos and used a half can of mild diced  fire roasted green chili peppers for a little bit of zip. as that is what was in the cupboard.     we had half of it left so I mixed in the rest of the green peppers in with the leftovers.   Hubby had 3 helpings.  I think I will add more onion next time and will also cover it while it  bakes so the spaghetti doesn't get hard.      will make again.

My family and I love this recipe but instead of cream of mushroom we use cream of chicken. It gives it a much better favor to the dish, thanks it's by far the best one yet!

I modified this recipe just a bit. Instead of chicken I used left over ham, I used green onion with tops, and a can of tomatoes and green chilies well drained instead of peppers and pimentos, and Velveeta instead of shredded cheese. I also used creole seasoning and seasoned salt to taste. I also added ¼ cup of sour cream and 1T butter for moisture. I added all these ingredients plus the chopped cook spaghetti, cream of mushroom, and wine to a large bowl and mixed well. Placed the mixture in a 9 X 13 pan and baked for 30 minutes stiring half way through. The smell was awesome!!!! The taste was amazing! My family had 3 large helpings each, no leftovers!

I have made this recipe several times and have never been disappointed. I do however add 2 stalks of finely chopped sauteed celery and an extra can of mushroom soup. For an extra treat use 3-4 cups of rotisserie or smoked chicken!  This recipe goes a long toward feeding a hungry crowd.

I have made this several times and get rave reviews every time!  I've only made the change of omitting pimentos (personal distaste) and adding a can of Rotel.  Other than that...perfecto!

I was looking for something similar to a turkey tetrazzini that they made in my dorm in college.  It was the only food that I loved there.  This was very close and very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used cream of chicken soup.  It was not dry at all.  Also, not cooking the veggies before adding them made for the strong flavor.  It was definitely not bland.  My very picky teenage daughter said "I don't know what it is but I really like it!"  Loved it!

fantastic fast recipe! I actually added a bit of milk about 1 cup to lessen the intense flavor of the cream of mushroom soup. I did bake for 45 minutes and then 15 minutes with cheddar cheese.

My husband loved this! I cooked the noodles too early, next time I will get everything else ready first and then cook the noodles. I also used cream of chicken soup and only 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. I made the noodles and chicken and mixed those in a bowl with the veggies, then put it into a baking dish, separately I mixed the can of soup, wine, 1 cup of  water and a buillon cube, then poured that over the noodles/chicken. Next time I will use more cheese. Today my husband asked for left-overs, which he NEVER does!!!

I saw lots of reviews saying they didn't like the "olives", but this recipe does not call for olives.  I grew up on this, my kids are growing up on it too.  Love it!  I do think it turns out creamier with velveeta, but a nice change when I am out.

I made this as per recipe. The family and I give it a rating of very good. I think the white wine, and the pimentos give it a nice taste distinction. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe because it had real cheese as opposed to Velvetta.  It was not bad.  Just not good.  Kinda boring.  Tasted like tuna casserole with chicken in it.

Turned out great. Used carrots instead of bell peppers because we did not have any. Used cream of chicken instead of mushroom, because that was what we had.  Added mushrooms, because my family loves mushrooms. Only thing I would change is to add garlic or garlic powder with some spices, such as basil or oregano. The casserole tasted better to me the next day. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good, although I did change up the recipe just to use what I had at home. I took out the pimento peppers and added drained Rotel diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro, a bit of honey, red wine instead of white, and a bit fewer noodles to give it more sauce. I also didnt bake it near as long...just long enough to melt the cheese. Probably total about 20 mins.

We doubled the recipe and used whiskey instead of wine which was a great suggestion. I would suggest precooking the onions and peppers and premixing the soup over the stove with a 1/2 cup of milk. Nothing about this recipe was fantastic but every thing about it was good. All in all I will definitely cook this one again.

This was a good base recipe...if made with exact recipe it will be very bland.  I used a rotisserie chicken, added garlic (lots), and used spicy rotel in place of pimentos & bell peppers.  I used white wine--next time I will try the whiskey.  I will also add twice the amt of cheese this recipe calls for next time :) Happy cooking everyone!

Fantastic recipe!  I doubled recipe as was making for my granddaughter and hubby as they have new baby...kept portion for us.  Added chicken stock from stewed chicken instead of wine and added a can of condensed cream of chicken soup since doubling.  I probably used about 2.5 cups of chicken stock as it seemed quite dry.  Delicious!

I liked this recipe because it was simple and tasted great. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and used frozen mixed vegetables rather than green pimentos. I also added italian seasoning, basil, and oregeno. Next time, I might add some salsa and sour cream.

Haven't cooked for a long (long) time, and found this to be a very easy recipe.  Used red and orange pepper for the green pepper and pimientos (husband's preference), seasoned the chicken with a little lemon pepper, and added a little garlic powder.  Also used 2 cans of cream of chicken and herbs, as another suggested.  Came out great!  I think next time I won't use as much cheese though.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This was fantastic.  I took the advice of others and changed it a bit.  Instead of wine I used chicken broth.  I did not put green pepper, I put a can of drained rotel in.  I sauteed the onion before adding it.  I used velveeta cheese inside it and cheddar on top.  I saved alot of time by using a 2 routissere chickens from the store.  My hubby does not like boiled chicken, and I was able to buy lemon pepper chicken which was wonderful.  Will definitely have this regularly!

Pretty good but a bit dry.  Also, I pulled pimentos out of a sliced olive jar because I couldn't just find pimentos and I think the recipe tasted a bit like green olives.  Next time will try to find a store with chopped pimentos.

Very easy and tasty dish!  Great for leftovers too.  I only made one change - I substituted red peppers for the pimentos, as my husband doesn't like pimentos.  It also adds color to the dish.

This was an excellent dish! I had a slew of boneless chicken thighs left, so I used those. Made the recipe almost exactly as written, except I had no cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken soup. My wife and I had a hard day with our daughter, and my wife called this dish "perfect comfort food after a long hard day". AND it was so easy to make. Next time I will try this with butter noodles, otherwise I won't change the recipe at all.

Oh no!  I think this is the first recipe on this site I haven't liked!  It was VERY bland, no flavor and the onion and green pepper needed to be sauted before put in casserole.  My husband and I dreched it in Lemon pepper to get it down.  I will not be making this again, I am so sorry to say!

This was good and easy. I used the leftovers to make a soup the next day. I took the baked cheese off the top and added the rest of the casserole to my crock pot. Put in some mixed veggies and 2 cans of chicken broth. Cooked for a couple hours and served with crusty bread.Tasty and didn't taste like leftovers!

Great dinner. Like others, I added my own spin on it - mainly with spices and I added about 1 cup of spaghetti sauce to give it a more italian flavor.
I also used garlic powder, seasoned salt, and 2 TB of pesto sauce.  I had some Tomato Basil egg noodles that were perfect for the dish.  Made it more of a casserole than spaghetti.  I will make this again.

This recipe was fantastic!!! I had to make some adjustments, such as nixing the wine.  I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1 can of cream of chicken to give it a creamy texture, mission accomplished.  I also added a can of Rotelle tomatoes.  Instead of 2 cups of cheddar cheese, I used a cup of velveeta and 1 cup of cheddar cheese.  It was a winner for my finicky kids and their friends.

Great Recipe! I didn't have cream of mushroom or white wine so I used cream of chicken and Chicken broth. I put some "healthy" stuff in there too. I used wheat pasta and 2% milk cheese- turned out just fine!

This wasn't fantastic, but it was easy to prepare and my whole family liked it. I used pre-cooked chicken to speed it up. However, it seemed like there was a ton of cheese ( I didn't care, but my mom is on a low -sodium diet).

Loved this recipe!! I did make a few changes based on other peoples recommendations and what I had on hand. I cubed 3 boneless skinless chicken breats, chopped 1 red pepper, 1/2 yellow pepper, 1 serrano pepper and 2 cloves of garlic . I put olive oil in a large frying pan and added the above. I seasoned with salt, pepper and rotisserie chicken seasoning while it cooked and removed it from the heat when chicken was cooked through. I also used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken and 1/4 cup of chicken broth as recommended by others. My boyfreind said it tasted like chicken pot pie with noodles, he loved it!! Definitely falls into the catagory of 'comfort food' I will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe was good.  I omitted the pimentos and used a green pepper instead.  I also used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken as suggested as others suggested and used chicken broth intead of the wine.  I liked that it was a quick recipe that could be made ahead of time and then popped into the oven when it was time to eat.  I will make this again.

This is the epitome of comfort foods!  I made it tonight, cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces. I sauteed it in a little olive oil with the chopped green pepper and onions, and about two tablespoons of chopped garlic. I also seasoned the mixture with a bit of poultry seasoning and pepper. It turned out fabulous. Thanks!!

This was very good, I took the advice of one reviewer and used chicken stock and chicken soup.I also cooked the onions and pepper. Next time I would use a low salt soup, as it was concentrated I found it a tad salty. I am sure if I followed the recipe to the letter it is 5 stars. I will make again.

Well, a family member told me this is the best thing I have ever made. It was a really big hit. I only made a few minor changes. I used a can of diced tomato with garlic, instead of pimento, just for personal preference. I used a whole chopped green pepper rather than just 1/4 of a cup, again personal preference. I sauteed the onion and pepper before adding to the casserole. I also cooked my chicken in a little bit of italian dressing. We all really loved this. Thanks!

First... Elizabeth P: My boyfriend loved this recipe and gives it a five. I told him about your review and others stating that the man in their house loved it. He says it cause men sometimes love an extremely simple meal, plus it's served in one bowl. I say whatever the reason, glad you enjoyed it. :)  I give this a five because while I liked it, I wasn't floored. I would make it again though. Changes I made: I used a can of Cream of Chicken and Mushroom instead of just Mushroom, and Chicken Broth instead of wine. I sauteed the green peppers and onions and added more than a cup of cheese on the top. Used garlic salt as the seasoning along with pepper. I also cooked the chicken in a skillet with a canola oil spray and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper. Adding flavor to the chicken really helped! Next time I'll add a can of mushrooms, cut down on the green peppers and pimentos, and add a bit more onions.

I make this dish all the time--my husband, 1-yr-old daughter and any guests we have always rave!  I also saute the bell pepper (usually red or yellow instead of green, family preference) and onion beforehand.  I also add a can of tomato sauce and more cheese than it calls for, but again--personal preferences.
This is easy to make and is very satisfying!  Yummy.

Loved this recipe.  Simple and delicious.  Of course I did make a few changes, not because it needed to be changed, just to tweak it to my taste.  I used green onions, for additional color.  And I added fresh dill.  Like another viewer suggested, I sauteed fresh mushrooms and green peppers.  Delicious.  This will not disappoint.

It was good, but I wasn't dazzeled by thie recipe considering all the adjustment needed.
I added 2 cans of cream of chicken, like others suggested, along with garlic powder and more pepper.
It still wasn't amazing or anything.
I've had much better chicken casseroles.

My husband liked it, but onyl after I added garlic powder. Before I did that it was very "blah".

I'd add more green peppers next time and something else, maybe cooked broccoli or another veggie too add something to this. It was pretty much just chicken in spaghetti with cream of chicken.
I was surprised there were so many rave reviews.
It wasn't bad, if I need an easy chicken meal I'd probably make it again, but I definitely wouldn't give this 5 stars.

I am really surprised how good this was. I was doubting it when I put it together, but it was really good! I did put 2 cans of cream of mushroom in, like others suggested, and a bit more than 1 cup of cheese on the top. The wine is a nice touch in this! This is a keeper!

An easy throw together dish that is very satisying.  I did not have white wine in the house so I substituted chicken broth and it still turned out fine.  Pimento is a nice touch in this, although one can of soup leaves it on the dry side.  I will make again but do as other reviewers suggested by adding an extra can of soup.

We liked this alot! I used carrots and black olives instead of bell peppers and pimentos because I knew my kids would prefer it. I boiled the carrots along with the pasta so they'd be tender enough. Also used chick broth instead of wine. I look forward to making it again, maybe playing around with it and adding more vegetables. Thanks for the recipe, Marty!

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it!  I will definitly make this again.  I put a little fresh thyme and a jalapeno pepper instead of the pimento.  Used cream of chicken and chicken broth, instead of cream of mushroom and wine.  Tasted excellent!!

This dish was a childhood favorite and I was pleased to see this recipe here. To make it like the dish I remembered, I omitted the onions, chicken, pimento, and peppers. I replaced the pimento with black olives. Very delicious and great for leftovers. Next time I would use less cheese--and try a sharper cheese.  I would make this again.

I made it with some changes and iit was so good. I forgot to take a picture of it though. I used three split chicken breasts, used the wine plus broth from the boiled chicken. I also added garlic when boiling the chicken. When I cooked the spaghetti I added olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder to the water which gave the spaghetti a great flavor. The next time I cook this I am adding a jar or two of mushrooms to the mix and I may add more mushroom soup to the mixture. This recipe is really good, my husband and I loved it. it just makes too much for just two people.

My wife and I look for recipes that make healthy quick and simple meals. It’s just the two of us and this recipe fits the bill. We start on day one meal one with a rotisserie chicken from Sams Club. We eat a portion of the chicken with vegetables. After eating I debone, cut up and refrigerate the leftover chicken. Within the next day or so I take the leftover chicken and make this recipe. It’s great and with a large rotisserie chicken I can make it twice. I do add garlic and a 4 oz can of button mushroom pieces to the recipe.  We love it.

There are a lot of different chicken spaghetti recipes and this is a good one. I added some mushrooms, and I think the chicken is much better shredded than chopped up for some reason. Oh and I made a crunchy topping, just some panko breadcrumbs sprinkled on top and drizzled with just a little olive oil.

Pretty good recipe! I read some of the other reviews and made a few changes: 
1) added a bunch of garlic powder
2) added a half can of diced tomatoes
3) sauteed the bell pepper and onion before adding to the mixture
The family loved it!

Made this yesterday. I sauteed oinion green pepper and minced garlic , then cooked chicken breast with garlic and white wine. While doing this I made spaghetti squash to make it a lower carb meal. Followed remaining  directions but didnt have pimentos so I added 1/4 cup of diced spanish olives stuffed with pimentos. Put 1/2 of spaghetti squash (2 1/2 cups)  in wth mixture and baked as directed. Then when serving I placed over spaghetti squash that remained (had heated remaining squah up)  Wow, it was  AMAZING. My girls raved how much they loved it. My husband asked if I could make it again soon. Thank you for sharing.

Simple and easy. I made the following changes: I sauteed the chicken with the green pepper and onions before. I also added garlic, carrots and celery and a can of diced tomatoes to the stir fry to soften. To make it more of a summary, white lasagna type dish, I used mozzarella and added Parmesan instead of cheddar cheese. I also used condensed cream of chicken instead of mushroom soup, and I skipped the pimentos as a matter of personal preference. I would make this again.

Very good! Added diced tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers, and a bag of Birds Eye frozen pepper stir fry (multi color pepper & onion strips) made it easy and colorful. A little Pampered Chef garlic & peppercorn rub made it extra tasty. Nice change of pace.

This is good. I poached the chicken in broth with onion and garlic powder. Then cooked the spaghetti in the broth after the chicken was done. I also used a can each of chicken and mushroom soup, sauteed the onion in butter first, skipped the bell pepper (didn't have any) increased the cheese, and added garlic powder. It's really easy to customize this recipe. Next time I'll add green chilis.

This recipe was well received by my husband and three grown sons. I changed the recipe slightly.  I didn't have any pimentos or green peppers so I used asparagus and red peppers. My son's girlfriend is a vegetarian so I used a half can of soup for hers and used the rest along with the full in the main dish. Very creamy! Everyone loved it!

Followed recipe exactly as directed, but this was a miss with the whole family. Maybe it was the mushy texture? Surprised because it got such great reviews.

I was looking for a comfort food recipe and came across this one. It really fit the bill perfectly! It's absolutely delicious. My husband, who isn't wild about pasta dishes really liked it and had seconds. The only thing I did change was I used cream of chicken soup and chicken broth, with a splash of white wine, instead of all wine. Personal preference with the soup. I would highly recommend this recipe. It's a keeper! Thank you so much...

I liked this recipe, however I found it to be a bit too salty for my tastes. It also benefited from a splash of hot sauce.

This was delicious and easy to put together.  I live alone so I saved a couple portions out for now and froze the rest.  Now I have something to look forward to when I don't feel like cooking.  I didn't change a thing.  It's delicious just the way it is written.

Over of all a very good recipe.  I added about 1/4 cup of flash fried mushrooms, fresh ground Grains of Paraside, and about 1/8 cup chopped dried tomatoes. This is definitely a recipe one can play with a bit as long as the basics are included in the foundation.

Pretty good. I think I would like it better with Cream of Chicken soup. Also, I replaced the white wine with chicken bouillon and the flavors were a little boring. I will probably use white grape juice next time so that it is more similar to the intended flavor.

Very bland.  The only change I made was I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and used chicken broth instead of wine. I will make again, probably with a can of Rotel to spice it up.

This was okay, but seemed a little bland and kind of generic.  On top of that, I did not like the olives, but that's my own personal taste, so I didn't knock it for the olive flavor.  However, it just seemed like something you would find on the side of a box somewhere.

Very good recipe.  Had a few pieces of raw chicken and wondering how to fix it.  So I boiled it up and used the following recipe.  I omitted the pimento and white wine, but followed the other ingredients.  Both hubby and I loved it.

This tasted good and everyone liked it, but it was about the same as something I already make on the stove top that is much much easier.  I will probably stick to my stovetop meal.

I was looking for something easy for dinner and that I already had the ingred. for when I came across this recipe. I didn't have pimentos or bell peppers, but a quick glance at other reviews convinced me to use Rotel instead.  I used the juice from the Rotel instead of the wine.  The Rotel gave it a little bit of a kick, which was good.  Overall, this was a quick, yummy recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because it didn't totally WOW me, but I will be making it again!

I love this dish! I have made it many times and everyone loves it. I do have a few changes/additions that I like to do (although its still amazing as is): I like to add diced canned tomatoes... I do not add the pimento peppers because I usually don't have those on hand.  I have also tried it with different cream of soups and every time it is great.

This is a family favorite of ours.  My kids love it, and I can't make it and not invite my  mom over or I'm in BIG trouble.  I'm making it today to take to a friend who has had surgery.  I've made it for that purpose often, and it's always a hit.

My picky husband loved this!  I didn't have white wine, so I substituted chicken broth, and skipped the pimento peppers.  I used a large can of cooked, shredded chicken.  This is a great recipe that I'll be making again and again.

This was definitely a hit with the men of the house... plus, I really enjoyed it myself!  It has earned a place among our monthly menu rotation.  I gave 4 stars only because I made some changes to accommodate ingredients I had on hand.  I had no wine so I used chicken broth and I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom.  Being a bit of a seasoning freak, I also added some Lawry's and a dash of ground red pepper.  I like that it can be made ahead and it gets more flavorful as it sits.  Great recipe Marty!

Great base recipe! Per previous reviews, I added a can of cream of chx soup, skipped the pimentos and sauteed the onion and green pepper in a little butter with some fresh garlic.  I also added a little italian seasoning and used Velveeta in place of the cheddar in the casserole and a mozzarella/Parm mixture on top of the casserole. Even my picky 3 year old liked it!

I had high hopes for this, but I thought it was pretty bland. Maybe some garlic or onion powder would have helped this have a little more flavor.

So tasty!! I tweaked quite a few things, as usual. I sauted an onion, green bell pepper, fresh mushrooms and couple cloves of garlic in olive oil. Meanwhile I boiled the chicken breasts and steamed some broccoli. I used the whole box of thin whole wheat spaghetti. I substituted 1/2 cup of chicken broth for white wi...ne and used a can of cream of mushroom AND a can of cream of chicken. I combined the sauted and steamed veggies with the sauces and spaghetti and followed the rest at stated.

great taste but this was a little dry for me. I wanted the sauce to be a little creamier so I'll probably add some milk to mine next time.

Made this for 18 in-laws who loved it!! Only changes: no pimentos or green peppers, I used yellow and red instead.  I alos added garlic and sliced celery.  I used bow tie pasta as we were all going to be eating holding our plates and it is easier than spaghetti.  I will definitely make again!

WOW - this is by far one of the best chicken spaghetti recipes I've ever tasted. I did use cream of chicken instead (personal preference). The hubby liked it. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was delicious, however, my fiancee didn't think it was the best.  I used low fat cheese and it didn't melt properly, but it was still wonderful!

I swapped out a few ingredients based on what I had, using feta instead of cheddar and red and orange peppers instead of pimento's and green.  I used the same amounts of everything though.  I also added a small jar of chopped artichokes with a few tbs of the liquid. I had hoped that the liquid in the artichokes would help it stay moist since others commented that it was dry.  It wasn't enough, because after baking for 30 min covered the pasta had absorbed all the liquids and it was way too thick.  I will try again, the taste was wonderful so next time I'll fill the empty soup can with the wine and top it off full with chicken broth (1 full can of liquid) instead of adding a whole 2nd can of soup as others did.  I'll probably add more of the veggies next time too.

When my Grandpa died a lady had made this spaghetti dish for my family and I loved it. That was about 10 years ago and I have been looking for this recipe ever since. I made it tonight and now my family is hooked on it too! Thank you so much for this recipe. It was exactly like the one I had at my grandpas funeral. The only thing I did differently was I used chicken broth instead of wine like some others suggested. By the way there was no left overs tonight! I am so glad I finally found the recipe! Thank You!

This is a good base recipe! There is many different ways to spice it up, I added cayenne pepper, chili powder, and red peppers. I found it a little dry so I added another can of soup like other reviews had suggested.

This recipe was very tasty.  I did add a can of cream of chicken with the can of mushroom soup, added corn, sliced mushrooms, and a can of drained Rotel diced tomatoes (mild).  I sprinkled with Parmesan cheese on top, baked in oven, covered for 15 mins and uncovered during last fifteen mins.  Will definitely make again.

This was a very good recipe.  My husband loved it.  I did make some changes though.  I did use the chicken stock like someone had mentioned instead of the wine as I am preggars.  I didn't use any of the peppers since my family doesn't like them.  This turned really good...it is a keeper.

My two picky eaters loved it!  I also subbed cream of chicken for cream of mushroom and used chicken broth instead of white wine.  I also only used 1/2 the onions (we are NOT onion fans!) I think next time I will try to slip in some chopped carrots, maybe some other veggies!  Great recipe!

Whole family loved this casserole. I did make a few changes. I bought a cooken chicken, that was much faster and tastier too. I used whole wheat noodles, substituted cream of chicken and chicken stock in stead of cream of mushroom and wine. I diced the onions, all the kids dislike onions and they didn't even know they were in there. It was fast and easy and the whole casserole was gone at the end of dinner. I definately will use this recipe again, Thanks!

I made this last night and received rave reviews from my guys!  I read the reviews and sauteed uncooked chicken with 1/2 green pepper, 1 medium onion and 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced in EVOO til chicken was cooked. I added Chardonnay wine, 2 cans of soup, and garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I added 1 c. cheddar cheese to the mixture and after spreading it in a dish, I sprinkled Parmesan Cheese on top and baked it fora total of 30 minutes.  It was AWESOME!!!  Definitely a keeper!

I mixed the cream of mushroom with cream of chicken.  I left out the pepper and chopped up celery instead.  I also added a dash of celery salt.  This was delicious!

This is a very boring recipe. My family did not care for it at all. I don't know what went wrong with mine, but it was definetly lacking something.  I don't think I will make this one again.

This recipe is very versatile!  Using only what I had available, I subbed cream of celery for the soup, velveeta for the cheese (which I thought was going to be terrible but used it because it was all i had, and it was still delicious), chicken broth for the wine, and angel hair pasta.  I added about a full cup of chicken broth because i thought it wasn't saucy enough and i'm glad i did.  I think you could really play with this and still have it come out great.  we also added peas instead of the peppers.  yum!

Great recipe!

I added 1/2 a cup grated Parmesan and 1/2 a cup cubed Velveeta as well, chicken broth for the white wine, and used colby-jack in place of the cheddar. Also added about half a cup chopped canned mushrooms and substituted a couple cloves garlic for the onion, since I didn't have any on hand. Came out great :)

Very easy to make and versatile. And yummy!

I used fat free soup, and halved the cheese and used low-fat. It did not turn out as good as I was hoping but it did have a nice delicate flavor. It was ok considering. I dont want to be unfair when rating the recipe, low-fat version would be 3 stars.

I give the version I made 5 stars.  I took advice from others and 1)added a can of cream of chicken soup 2)added black olives, 3)nixed the pimentos, 4)used yellow bell pepper, 5)used extra cheese.  I sauteed the veggies before adding them to the mixture to bake. It was a hit and we definitely will be having this again.

This was really yummy and kid friendly. I didn't have the peppers, but I did add garlic and did saute the veggies and the cooked onions gave it all a slightly sweet flavor.  I sauted the veggies in light Italian dressing instead of oil--nice flavor. Lastly, I used half whole wheat pasta and my kids couldn't tell at all!

Found this recipe to be blah, needed more seasonings. Also I will saute the vegetables first. They were still hard after cooking in the casserole. I think I would use velveeta or cheez whiz for a creamier consistency. With a few adjustments this could be a good recipe.

This was a good casserole.  I added a can of spicy diced tomatoes and I used Velveeta in the casserole and topped with the cheddar.  I also sauted the peppers and onions in some garlic before mixing.  I will make again and will probably use 2 cans of tomatoes next time.
