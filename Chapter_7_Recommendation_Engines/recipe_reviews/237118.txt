Pretty basic recipe; needed more seasoning for us. To achieve rough-chopped olives & avoid turning it into sludge, I put rinsed pitted olives - one can at a time - in the Ninja container with enough plain water to 2/3rds full so the olives could move freely, then pulsed the power button just until the olives were rough-chopped, drained them in a sieve, dumped them in a large mixing bowl and repeated the process using 3 cans green olives & 2 cans black olives.  Mixed in chopped roasted red peppers, capers, garlic, thyme, oregano, Dijon mustard, S&P, lime juice, a small squirt of Sriracha and oil to nearly cover it. (1/3 EVOO to 2/3 canola since EVOO solidifies under refrigeration and I wanted to avoid that.) Refrigerated several hours to let the flavors marry. Liking it as a topper on broiled salmon as well as zucchini 'noodles.'

This is fantastic! I didn't have capers and used a combination of about 3/4 green olives and 1/4 kalamatas, both rinsed well. I also threw in a couple spoonfuls of sundried tomatoes. This recipe is a keeper.
