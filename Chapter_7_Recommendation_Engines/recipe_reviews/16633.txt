This recipe was amazing! Its not the healthiest of recipes but it tasted wonderful and my friends and I all agreed that it desevered 5 stars. I made only a couple slight changes: I cooked the chicken breasts in olive oil with Italian seasoning before cutting into pieces. I used herb and garlic feta cheese and sliced olives. The name of the recipe really should be Arti-Cheesy Chicken Pasta as the Penne pasta is not listed in the ingredients and should be. I used approximately 20oz. of Penne pasta. One of my friends recommend that I double the garlic next time. Serve with a side of green salad topped with balsamic vinaigrette.

My cousin made this dish for us and all six of us loved it!  A bit salty because of the bacon and soup.  Also, try using 1/2 of the cream or substitute milk for half of the cream because it is very rich.  A very filling dish all by itself.

This sauce was VERY good. I omitted the artichoke hearts because I don't like them. I used herb and garlic feta and turkey bacon, as we don't eat red meat. 

Very awesome sauce, I think you could probably use most any variation of things and it'd still come out wonderful. Next time I will probably use a little less feta, and maybe some parmesan or something. Very yummy indeed.

Wow, this was really good, its not very often that I find a recipe that my husband enjoys as much as I do. I love cooking, and although this took quite a bit of time to prepare it was well worth the wait, while it was simmering I added 1.5 Tablespoons of italian seasoning, and some pepper. The recipe didn't say how to cook your chicken or whether or not to cut it up. I boiled my raw chicken breasts for 20 minutes and cut them into bite size pieces before adding into the recipe, anyways this was great and anyone thinking about trying.... SHOULD.

Yummy!  I did lighten my version by subbing chicken broth for the cream soup, and a little white wine and milk for the heavy cream.  Wait to salt after adding feta as it can be pretty salty itself.  Served over bowtie pasta -we were extremely happy!!

This was very good, but I made a few changes. Instead of artichoke hearts I put in broccoli florets and I used turkey bacon and half and half to cut out some of the fat. I served it over pasta. Very yummy.

Made this with a few revisions, used turkey bacon instead of regular only 5 pieces (you may have to add 1 tbsp of Olive Oil or Butter for mushrooms) , I also used Organic 1% milk instead of cream and added a tomato to the mix.  I also added quite a bit of crushed red pepper.  This is a yummy dish, served over rice!

This is now my new favorite low carb dish. The flavor of the sauce is fantastic. Of course being a vegetarian I had to change it up. No bacon, I used olive oil and bacon salt, which is a vegetarian product to saute the mushrooms. I used the full 8 oz. of flavored feta since that's what was in the package. I used soy chicken strips instead of the chicken. I eliminated the olives, yuck. I added a chopped onion and used frozen quartered artichokes instead of the marinated ones. The first time I made it I had some homemade low carb cream of mushroom soup in the fridge, this time I had homemade cream of broccoli soup in the fridge. Both were equally as good. I put it over pasta for my husband and ate it without for myself. I gave it only 4 starts because I don't think I would have liked it with the bacon and olives even if I weren't a vegetarian. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was really good! Due to family preference we left out the artichoke and olives but did everything else according to recipe. Cooked the chicken in a little olive oil and butter and served it all over bowtie pasta. Next time we'll cut back the feta a bit to allow for some other flavors to come through.

Very yummy!  I used a can of milk instead of cream, pan cooked my chicken with EVOO, used fresh garlic, added mushrooms and left out the olives.  We both loved it!  I will add this to my regulars!

TASTY! We felt like we were dining Italien! In my haste to get dinner on I didn't realize the recipe called for COOKED chicken! I quicly cut into cubes and sauteed in a tad of olive oil and bacon drippings while I was making the sauce. I think there was a little too much bacon, but other than that it was very good! The sauce would compliment many types of meats! Served with Basmati rice. Nice post!

This is an awesome starter recipe! The base is so great that you can omit or add anything you want. For example, I get rid of the olives and artichokes. I add more bacon, portobella mushrooms, scallions extra garlic and shrimp. No matter what combo you use it still comes out tasty! Excellent!

FANTASTIC!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was absolutely wonderful!  I've made this for company twice now and everyone loved it - - and insisted on the recipe.  I, too, served it over penne pasta.  Not low calorie, but it's fun to splurge every now and then.  YUM!

We loved this, I did half and half instead of cream and still could use more milk.  The bacon I cut in half also. It was easy to cut on fat without losing the flavor of the recipe. Yummy!

This was delicious.  I used one soup can of milk instead of cream and used just half the bacon.  Feta can be too strong for us so I used just 4 oz of it, but it was just wonderful! Gotta try it.

Just made this for dinner tonight and the whole family loved it. The only thing I changed was 4 oz of feta cheese instead of 6oz. Serves more than 4 though, that's okay, got some leftovers :) Very flavorful and easy to make. Will be adding this as a regular. Thank You for submitting this recipe!

This was wonderful, quick and easy to make - my family loved it!  I actually used evaporated skim milk instead of the heavy cream to make it a little healthier, and Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic (which allowed me to cut down a little on the minced garlic).  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!!! There were so many flavors going on, but they blended well together. The only changes I made were I used green olives instead of black (I'm not a black olive fan). I also chopped my chicken into pieces and put the mixture over pasta. Even if I hadn't put this mixture over pasta, it definitely serves more than 4!!! I think it is more like 8. There was so much that I think I will be eating it for a week!

The sauce is to die for. I omitted to artichoke hearts (didn't have any) and diced the chicken so I could just serve the whole thing over penne pasta. While I love black olives, I didn't care for them in this. Maybe it was one too many competing flavors, maybe it was because they were warm. That kind of thing can easily be adjusted to taste. The more important thing is that the sauce was perfectly rich and creamy and I was in heaven!

I thought this was fantastic! I did make some changes, though:  I only used half the cream and supplemented it with chicken stock as needed, omitted the black olives, which just didn't sound good to me, and I only fried half a pound of bacon, which made plenty of grease for the mushrooms and made just enough bacon for the sauce.  I served it with bowties and it got raves!! Thanks Douglas! :)

This is a wonderful recipe.  I cut up the chicken, used half the amount of cream and added a little milk - as necassary.  I also left out the olives and artichoke hearts and served it over penne pasta.  It was SO amazing.

My boyfriend is still bragging about this dish.  I omitted the bacon, used half the cream and feta, substituted grape tomatoes for the olives.  Definitely not a light dish, but awesome!

MMMM!  Great flavors!  I would suggest cutting the chicken in pieces, for a more even distribution, since this makes many servings.  I forgot to tell the family not to use the mushrooms, so was short when it was time to make this.  I added some shredded zucchini from the garden, and it was still yummy!

I made this for 25 people on Valentine's day and almost everyone loved it! I served it over a bed of pasta (any shape will work) with Garlic green beans and a spinach & strawberry salad. Because I had to make so much, I pre-baked the chicken breasts and cooked the sauce separately on the stovetop. Then I just poured the sauce over the chicken and let it bake until we were ready to eat. I only used 1/2 the cream though and it was plenty. There was quite a bit of sauce leftover. You could probably make 1/2 the sauce and be fine! I also used plain artichoke hearts and marinated them myself in olive oil, vinegar, parmeson cheese and italian seaosoning (cheaper for large groups!). Great recipe, doug! thanks!

OMGosh! Wonderful. I followed other users advice. Cooked chicken in 1 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning before adding. Used half whip and half milk. Double the artichoke hearts! Used penne pasta. 20 oz of pasta feeds 4 adults. Will make again.

I changed a few things, but overall, it was incredibly tasty!  I ommitted the black olives, feta and cream... I added onion, 1 C sr cream, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/2 C white whine.  So, so good... I didn't even serve it over anything... came out almost stew-like.  Really delicious... my kids loved it!

Made this exactly as its written and despite it being a touch on the salty side I thought this was superb!  Next time I just won't add salt.  Thanks for a definite keeper!
Update 08 - swiss is a great swap for parmesean, also cream of mushroom with roasted garlic adds a nice touch.  Still lovin it!

AWESOME!  This dish taste just like a dish that I just had a chain Johny carinos!  When I cooked my chicken I cut the breast into thin strips, then seasoned them with Itailan bread crumbs and cooked in olive oil and real butter! I also browned the fresh galic I used with the mushrooms!

This was extremely good.  I loved the richness of the sauce.  I am not sure why so many people don't use the artichokes.  I am not an artichoke lover, I don't like the texture.  I used them for the flavor and just simply pushed them aside on my plate.  They add something wonderful to the dish. This would be an excellent dish to "wow" your company with!!

This was one of the best dishes I have ever cooked!!  I omitted the olives and artichoke hearts because my family doesn't like them.  I used milk in place of the cream and mozarella instead of the feta.  Wonderful-I got requests for this for leftovers (what little was left). I cannot imagine anyone not liking this receipe!

When I asked my family if this was a keeper they all said YES!!  I doubled the recipe as I have large family put in two cans of soup one can of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.  Only put in a few artichoke hearts and no olives (just forgot!) Everybody had seconds.  There were no left overs.  I served this over 'mini' penne pasta noodles and it was just awesome! Thanks Doug for a luxurious twist to my chicken!

My husband and I  thought this was terrific and so did my son and his wife.  Definitely company fare and the bacon puts it over the top.  Talk about comfort food! I'll be making this again as soon as my arteries stop gasping!

Had friends over for dinner - made this with a salad and some garlic bread - HUGE hit!  Very easy to cut the fat - used non fat cream of mushroom and not as much bacon.  
Did peas instead of olives - thought capers would be a good substitution as well.
Great recipe!

I made this for dinner guests. Every time
I talk to them, they tell me how great 
the meal was. I reduced the half and half
and added milk. I also used low fat 
mushroom soup. I also cut the chicken
into small pieces. We ate it on top
of fusilli pasta. This recipe is a big
winner!!!

I used half the feta, no artichokes, half the bacon, and substituted 1/2 cup sour cream for the heavy cream.  It was ok, but was kind of heavy.  Next time I'll use a full package of bacon (personal preference) and half a can of the cream of mushroom soup and will try the heavy cream instead of the sour cream.

Thank you so much for this recipe. You combined several of my absolute favorites: olives, artichokes, mushrooms, feta, parmesan, bacon... it's the ULTIMATE in comfort food to me. I follow the recipe except as far as measurements go, I rarely measure anything, I just toss in however much seems right. Also, this absolutely does NOT need the penne. Spectacular without it.

I cooked the chicken in chicken broth and then used a little of that for the mushrooms instead of bacon grease. I doubled the chicken to 2 whole breasts, but didn't use quite as much mushrooms (I didn't read the recipe amt before I went to the store). I added the garlic to the end of the mushrooms cooking time. I substituted whole milk for the cream. I left out the olives. I didn't add any salt or pepper. I think adding 8 ounces of feta would be ok - the size of unflavored feta. It melts in and not overly feta tasting. (I will do this next time). Recipe suggests serving over penne pasta- it was saucy enough I dumped pasta into casserole. If you have leftovers, may need to add a little more milk or soup. (Other than that, I followed the recipe EXACTLY!) :) Recipe has a wonderful bacon flavor as a leftover.

At first I liked this but the more I ate, the more bland it did become, especially after mixing it with pasta. My husband enjoyed it, however, that is why it gets 4 stars. I think you may get better results just using jarred Alfredo sauce. Used more chicken (just cooked with the bacon). I didn't use anywhere the amount of bacon the recipe called for.

This recipe was soooo easy and was delicious. I know you're not supposed to rate based on your changes, but I think it still would have been fantastic  without the few changes I made. I used way more parmesan and used about half, maybe three fourths, of the cream suggested. I also used a 12 oz jar of artichoke hearts instead of a 6.5 oz jar, we're big fans! ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

I thought after reading the reviews, this would be a very rich recipe. So to change this, I decided to not add the feta (don't really care for the taste anyway). Substituted a cup of low-fat milk & a pint of sour cream and much more parsesan cheese to the recipe. Otherwise, I followed it pretty much-probably less bacon too & used canned mushrooms. I wasn't sure the flavors would mix, but I put in the mushrooms anyway. I will share this recipe with friends, which is my highest compliment!!! :)

We absolutely LOVED this recipe.  Don't change a thing, the combination of the flavors is superb, which you will miss out on if you eliminate anything!  (Make sure you use Kalamata olives in a jar, NOT canned black olives...there is a BIG difference in the taste and consistency.) The only thing we changed was the title,  we call it Creamy Artichoke Chicken...it sounds better.  Great job Douglas, thanks!

Great tasting sauce with a nice blend of flavors.  Since I am not a fan of feta cheese I made a sustitution and used mozarella cheese instead.  I think I may have read this from another reviewer.    I would make a  slight adjustment and add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin out the sauce since mine was a little on the thick side.  Maybe this was due to the mozarella cheese.  I'd also  cut up the chicken into bite size pieces to serve over the pasta but that is probably personal preference.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks Douglas

I usually don't care for "white" sauce but this is a really tasty change of pace. I used left over bacon and had raw chicken, so I cooked the chicken (breast tenders) in 2 tbs of olive oil, added the mushrooms when the chicken was done and a minced clove of garlic. An earlier review suggested mushroom garlic soup so that is what I used. 1 pint of cream I changed to,  1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk, added one small zucchini that was sliced in 1 inch pieces, the olives, and 1 can of quartered unmarinated artichoke hearts drained and let this mixture simmer for about 15 minutes just to reduce the sauce. Then added 2 tbs of feta cheese and 2 tbs of parmesan cheese. I thought the full amount of feta with the bacon would make the dish to salty and more can be added at the table if someone wants more cheese, we didn't add any additional. Mixed the sauce with 16 oz penne pasta (cooked and drained). It does make a lot so unless you have an extra large skillet a deeper pan maybe needed.

We really love this recipe, but I don't use the bacon and I cut down on the cream. The flavors of all the ingredients really go together well and as long as I chop the artichokes, the kids even love it!

Excellent Douglas! Thanks for the recipie. I cut down some on the cream as well, but it still made a great amount of sauce. I also added some sun-dried tomatoes.

Yum, this one will leave you feeling like you need to go to the gym, but it's great. I used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream, which helped a bit. I also used mozzerella in addition to half the amount of feta.

Very good.  My husband loved it.  I didn't use the soup.  To make the sauce thicken I just coated the cubed chicken with some flour before cooking it.

this wasn't as exciting as i anticipated after reading the rave reviews here. i used reduced fat feta cheese, reduced fat mushroom soup and combined the cream with 2% milk (half cream/half milk). i over-salted the dish, not accounting for the salt in the soup already. i think they're are too many flavors/ingredients competing against each other in this dish, and if i were to make this again, i'd eliminate the olives first and the artichokes second. i was impressed, though, that the chicken (which i cut into large chunks) remained very tender and didn't require a knife to cut. i'd also reserve this dish for the full caloric effect, and use non-reduced fat items all the way.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish!  It turns out very elegant--like something that you would pay a lot for in a nice restaurant.  It's perfect with a nice glass of wine and a salad.  I recommend this to everybody.  It was a hit at my house, so we'll definitely make it again and again.  Thanks, Doug!

I made this last night and it was a hit with my husband and toddler! I didnt add the artichokes, olives or chicken, but instead used bacon and mushrooms. The sauce I made exactly the same and it was delicious! No need to add salt though, but I did add some freshly ground black pepper. The feta brought it to the next level!

We really enjoyed all the different textures this sauce had going for it, but the sauce itself while rich needed something to bring all the flavors together.  I added a good bit of basil which helped, but maybe oregano and/or thyme would have been a better choice.

This was excellent, both hot and cold.  I used  3 1/2 breasts on the bone and boiled them before cubing them.  Be generous with the bacon and artichokes, and use whole black olives cut in 1/2 because the slices get lost.  The sauce is delicious.  Served over Goya mini-angel hair pasta.  Delish!

Made this last night. Followed recipe except did not have enough mushrooms. It was super. My 17 yr old came home later and said what is this white stuff it is sooo good. Ate the rest for lunch. Thanks Douglas, will make again with the right amount of mushrooms next time. Served on top of white rice. 2 thumbs up!

Yea, not really impressed. It was ok, not really all that tastey. I mean it is good, but nothing to brag home about. I too think it was the cream of mushroom soup, that I disliked. I probably wont make it again.

This dish turned out to be pretty intresting.  My husband loved it.  I just thought it was alright.  I think it would've been a little better with an alfredo base instead of the cream of mushroom soup.

I didn't feel like a store run so I used what I had. No mushrooms so I used onions and pimento. No cream but I used about a third cup half-n-half. Skipped the black olives and subbed a good garlic cheese for feta. The bacon was wonderful and we loved the dish. Next time I'll add the mushrooms.

I liked this recipe more than my fiance, who didn't think that all of the flavors meshed well together.  We used half-and-half and tossed it with pasta.  The sauce was very creamy and abundant, but the flavor of the feta  and parmesan got lost in it.  I had to sprinkle some shredded mozzarella on top to give it the cheesiness that I was expecting.  Actually, without adding black pepper and extra cheese it was surprisingly somewhat bland.

This was good, if I make it again I will do a few changes.  I wouldn't use so many mushrooms, you don't really notice them so I don't think it would be missing anything.  I wouldn't use cream, maybe half n half or light sour cream, it was way too rich for my family.  And I doubled the artichoke hearts, shouldn't have done that.  It tastes gourmet, but is really very simple.

This was good.  I didn't like the black olives though.  I knew it would be rich - but WOW it was super rich.  Very yummy.

Very easy to prepare, I tossed it all in with bow tie pasta, so all was coated. Enjoyed by all my family.

My kids; 3,4, and 5 all loved this meal.  I used evaporated milk instead of the cream.  I used less bacon then it called for as well.  This meal was wonderful for my family.  My husband loves artichokes, my kids love olives and mushrooms, and I love white sauce in pasta.  We will be keeping this one around.

This was delicious, but way too rich for a main dish. The only thing I left out was the black olives.  I would make it again without the chicken and serve it as a side dish to grilled chicken and fresh green beans.

A very flavorful, wonderful meal. All in all, this recipe was superb. I only gave it four stars because the next go-round, I think i will only use half of the jar of artichoke hearts. I don't care for the artichoke hearts either, but I am no dummy--i know they add a flavor that cannot be duplicated. But yet and still, the whole jar was a bit much---just a tiny bit much.

Sorry, but we didn't like this one.   Talk about swimming in sauce!  A PINT of cream?  I used only half that, and it was way too watery for us.  Won't be making this again, but if I did, I would thicken the sauce for sure.

This was very good. My picky eater husband ate this up :)
I made without artichokes and used goat cheese instead on top of noodles.
It was gone :)

Came out like a really nice cream sauce but was surprisingly bland for everything that went in there.  Maybe it was because I used spinach penne.  I liked it though.

Very good!  My husband LOVED it.  We didn't use artichoke hearts, not big fans, don't know if it altered the taste much or not.  Added a little less feta than called for too.  Served over ziti & loved it.  Thanks!

if i could rate this as a ten i would.  

put this over a bed of rice or pasta and it is a meal in and of itself.

very rich and creamy - i used a bag of whatever shredded cheese i had in the house and it was just yummy
