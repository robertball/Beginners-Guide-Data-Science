This was edible, but I won't make it again.  The sauce was runny, and there was just nothing to it but the shrimp.  It didn't taste particularly distinctive at all.

Okay, so I did not go to the store after I found this recipe...so I used the Jamacain yellow curry powder instead.  I wanted to cook shrimp and basil together in a dish.  This was excellent and very easy.  I added a little green bell pepper and served it with rice and Thai red chile sauce.

wow, this is a great dish.  I WILL be making this one again- very straight- forward. Has a rich body to it, a mild spicy flavour ( but it doesn't overwhelm the shrimp or basil). I think it would be a good introduction to curry dishes ( if you have never tried curry before). I can't say enough about this dish- it was very satisfying.

I love this recipe, but I have altered it a bit.  I add some cornstarch to thicken so that it's not so runny and I also add more sugar because I like it more sweet and coconutty.  I also add snowpeas to get a veggie in there and the bright green makes the dish more pleasing to the eye.

This was very quick and easy. I substituted chicken for the shrimp and beef broth for the wine. The sauce was a little on the thin side, but I served it over brown rice that was a little dry and it really soaked up the sauce. Will make again, thanks for the recipe!

It was good but way too much work for the results. If you have a lot of time and don't expect great results for your efforts this might work for you.

Tastes much richer than it is. I used light sour cream to save a few extra calories and it turned out beautifully. The curry is really sweet. Next time I will use more basil. The fresh basil made a real difference over dried basil. The recipe scaled very nicely for two.

Delicious!  Thank you, Suki, for your review - it's right on the money.  This is a great dish to try if you're just venturing into the world of cooking with curry. I didn't have red curry powder, so just used regular, what I had on hand.  I had no problem with the sauce; I felt it was the right consistency; no need to add cornstarch to thicken.  The only thing I would change when I make this again would be to either omit or reduce the sugar.  Although it doesn't call for a lot, I just didn't like the touch of sweet in this dish.

I think the recipe has potential, but it came out kind of bland.

This was good but it was a little tangy from the sour cream and lime juice.  It needs something to balance it out.  Maybe some brown sugar or coconut milk. I added some thai chili paste. I think it would be great with chicken too.
