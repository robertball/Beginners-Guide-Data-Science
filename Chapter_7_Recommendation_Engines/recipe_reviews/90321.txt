This was absolutely delicious and my husband and I agreed that this recipe is a keeper!  I did make a couple of changes per other reviewers' suggestions and my family's own tastes (the changes I made include using 3 teaspoons of Italian seasoning instead of 2, adding 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, adding an extra clove of garlic, using 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese instead of 2, and using 2 eggs instead of just 1 egg).  I also served these on Hoagie rolls and topped them with shredded Mozzarella cheese.  The only other additional comment I wanted to make was that I ended up with 24 meatballs instead of 12 (I thought making only 12 meatballs made the meatballs a little too big for our tastes).  Thank you so much for a great meal idea!

I was searching for a meatball recipe and decided to try this one.  My 5 star rating is for the meatballs only (with my alterations).  The flavor was amazing; this is going in my personal cookbook.  I made my own ground beef using my KitchenAid.  I decided to add onion.  I incorporated the onion and parsley with the beef as I ground it.  I increased the Italian seasonings to 1 T, the parmesan to 1/4 cup, and used 2 eggs.  I also added 2 tsp salt and 2 tsp fresh ground pepper.  I also added 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella.  Used the KitchenAid to do the mixing for a few minutes - then formed the meatballs using a cookie scoop (evenly measures one tablespoon size servings).  I ended up with 30 meatballs.  TIP:  Keep your hands wet as you form the meatballs - helps keep the meat from sticking to your hands the the meatballs form faster.  Of course if you have a cookie scoop, this will greatly speed up the process.  Be sure to bake the meatballs for at least 30 minutes to ensure they are properly cooked through.

This is a great meatball recipe. the night before, I made my own sauce, prep the meatballs. Before I went to work I threw everything in the crockpot setting on low and cooked all day. I also had 24 MBs but that was ok, I froze what I didn't use for another meal.
Thanks

These are really good meatballs.  I added some salt and pepper and a few shakes of cayenne pepper because we like it hot.  I also toasted some hoagie rolls to make individual servings and used mozzarella.  Delicious!

EDIT: After making this a few more times I'd like to add some advice.  Use the leanest hamburger you can find.  Even 85/15 will produce too much grease.  Bake over a broiler pan to get rid of the grease.  Adding one or two links of fresh, spicy sausage is delicious.  Just slice open the casings and add the meat.  Use the cheap bread crumbs.  I've tried this recipe with fresh, storebought, and panko (Japanese bread crumbs) and it tastes best with the cheap, 'Italian' breadcrumbs.

Delicious!  I think you could use the inside of the baguette that you scoop out for the bread crumbs!  Just give them a zap in a food processor and presto!

I loved these as well as the kids. I made them on individual hoagie type rolls instead. Used mozzarela also. After putting the meatballs on the subs I served the remaining spaghetti sauce in bowls for dipping. Next time I will also add a pinch of salt to the meatballs.

The meatballs were very good.  I used italian style bread crumbs and added more parmesan cheese.  I didn't use jarred sauce, I used homemade sauce that I thawed from the freezer.  I put the rolls under the broiler and then assembled the sandwich.  My husband loved these!

This recipe was wonderfully yummy! I got heaps of rave reviews from my partner and stubborn 6 year old.

I made just a few adjustments...

Lessoned the Italian herbs.
I used 2 eggs 
I had no parm...and I really wanted meatballs so we subbed mozz cheese, just a bit.
I forgot..sub rolls...we had them as is.
I added 3 cloves of raw garlic to the meatball mix.
Omitted parsley

Salt/pepper/garlic salt to taste.

I made my own spaghetti sauce...

1 box/can of chopped/chunked/diced tomatoes.
3 cloves of garlic, minced.
1/2 of a medium sized onion, chopped.
Salt/Pepper to taste.
2 tablespoons of olive oil.
1 small can/box of tomato paste.

Heat up the oil, sautee the garlic and

This was very good.  I did not have any breadcrumbs on hand but I did have cheese croutons which I used a rolling pin to make into breadcrumbs. I also could not find any baguette bread so I used French bread instead.  The bread was really good too, it was nice and warm and crunch and added so much to the meatballs.  I had the meatballs in the oven for 45 minutes which they were still a tad pink.  Next time I will put them in there longer because I like my hamburger well-done.  Other than that I love the crunchy bread and cheese.  Yummy, thanks for the great recipe, I will be making this again!

These were very good, simple to do in the oven. A great sandwich and a break from the ordinary cold cut for sure. Better than Subway's meatball subs. I was concerned because at first the meat seemed really dry and was hard to work with, so I reread the direction to make sure there wasn't any liquid missing...nope. I went ahead and baked them as directed and it turned out fine. I'm glad I didn't give in to the urge to add a couple teaspoons of milk. I made about 24 meatballs instead of 12 so they would be more bun sized.

Absolutely Delicious! We noticed once the meatballs sat and simmered in the sauce, boy oh boy, better! Next time I will combine some sausage in with the ground beef. Anyway, this is a winner!

Absolutely delicious. I'll definitely make again! I will say, the meatballs took more like 40 minutes to cook but if you'll brown them a little before putting them in the oven, they'll not only develop a crispier outside, but they'll probably cook in the 15-20 minutes described in this recipe.

This was great!  Quick, easy, and super delicious.  If only this was healthy, but oh well.  it makes for a wonderful fun-for-you treat.

I didn't toast the bread twice--only when heating up the entire sandwich at the end to melt the cheese--and it came out perfect.  I also used store bought marinara sauce instead of the suggested spaghetti sauce--coming from Chicago, putting any spaghetti sauce on a meatball sub is blasphemy.  If I would have had the time I would have made my own sauce (but every cook cuts corners sometimes).

This was pretty good and I would make again.  I added a lot more spices to it ...fresh basil, herbs of provance, etc...It needs a little more garlic.  

Use a hoggie roll or something that size.

This is a good basic meatball recipe, but I tweaked it a little: Used 2 tsp dried parsley flakes instead of fresh, increased the parm cheese to 4 tbs, added 1 tsp black pepper, added 2 tsp driced minced onions, omitted the dried Italian seasoning, and used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain, Measurements for everything else stayed the same. I used an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs. I browned them in a pan (without oil) on the stovetop for a few minutes, then drained the fat, added a jar of spaghetti sauce, and transferred the pan to a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. They were flavorful and not dry at all. I served them on toasted sandwich rolls (without oil, garlic powder, or salt) and sprinkled with provolone cheese.

Wonderful recipe! I made this last night for my family and it was a big hit. I doubled the recipe and had to work with ingredients I already had at the house. So I omitted the parmesean cheese from inside the meatballs and used shredded mozzerella instead of provelone on top. Yum!

Very good! I used less Italian seasoning (personal preference), and had to use dried parsley, less, of course. I also used more cheese than called for and used mozzarella instead of provolone. This is always a great sandwich, and it was nice to try a new recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

Given the previous reviewers' feedback on dry meatballs - I cooked half of them in the oven and half in the sauce. The meatballs cooked in the sauce definitely won me over. Not nearly as dry and I loved that the sauce and meatballs exchanged flavors, which may address others' opinions that these meatballs didn't have enough flavor. I also made these with "very special spaghetti sauce" from this site, minus the meat used in that recipe since i obviously didn't want to serve these with a meat sauce. Overall, yum, particularly if meatballs are cooked in the sauce rather than baked in the oven.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars only because I personally never try recipes that have less than 4 stars since I don't have the money to be risking ingredients over unreliable recipes, however this recipe is certainly worth trying. But I will give anyone planning on making this one suggestion, definitely use at the very leanest, 80/20 ground beef instead of a leaner fat content beef, this recipe leaves the meat mixture far too dry to be using lean ground beef, especially if you like your meatballs juicy like those at Subway. Mine were juicy but I'd like them just a TAD  bit juicer so I think I will take away about 50% of the breadcrumbs next time. The seasoning on these meatballs while using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs were perfect, so if you're using plain breadcrumbs, I'd increase the Italian seasoning just a little. Also added just a little fresh red bell pepper in tiny diced pieces to the meatballs. I made my own spaghetti sauce by pulse-blending a can of stewed tomatoes for only about 5 seconds (left it a LITTLE chunky), then transferred to a sauce pan and simmered on low while meatballs were in the oven, I added Italian seasoning, basil, cumin, Parmesan,  salt/pepper, a little  red cooking wine, sliced onion, a few drops of Tabasco, and garlic powder to the sauce. I'm sure if you don't have spaghetti sauce available you can do the same thing with a can of diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes, or crushed tomatoes,--- or fresh tomatoes with some water.

This recipe is a keeper. We ended up with close to 30 meatballs because we made them small, but I still cooked them for 20 minutes. We did use two eggs instead of 1, added a bit of black pepper to the meatballs and used shredded mozzarella instead of provolone, and used individual hoagie style rolls. The only difficult or time consuming part was just mixing and balling the meat.

This was sooo good! I have a meatball cooker that drains the fat out of them so they were dry and soaked up the sauce perfectly. The spices in this recipe were perfectly proportioned.  Next time I won't use baguette, it was too hard.

I made a few modifications to this recipe. To be a bit healthy, I used ground turkey meat. I also added a few tsps. of fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden. I simmered marinara sauce for an hour and dropped the meatballs into them. They turned out so delicious! I will make this again!

Made these last night and my daughter and hubby raved. I used fresh Italian rolls and dug some of the middle out so the meatballs had a nice spot to sit. Used four meatballs per sandwich, added more sauce, and layered with cheese. I heated them at 350 until cheese was melted and roll was a little crusty. Great recipe!

These were good, though next time I may add a touch of salt to the meatballs.  I baked them on a rack in my baking pan so all the grease could drip away -- I wish I had sprayed it with nonstick spray.

Excellent, delicious meal.  The only change I made was to use mozzeralla cheese instead of provolone because that is what we had.  These meatballs would also be great with spaghetti, but having them on a sandwich made for a very popular dinner at my house.  I also think the meatballs could be made in the slow cooker, making this very easy and ready to eat when you are.

I prepared the meatballs according to the recipe.  I used Italian sausage flavored sauce.  I served them with mozzarella and provolone on a french sub roll.  My wife and I loved it, but it was a little too strong for the kids.  I'm giving it 5 stars based on how much the adults enjoyed it!

Yum! This was my first time ever making meatballs, and I expected it to be difficult but it was pretty easy. The meatball sandwiches turned out great - enough for 3 meals for me. I'd definitely recommend this recipe.

Fabulous! Again the father in law did not care for this, but everyone else loved them. Cant always use fresh parsley of Parmesan cheese but it still tastes great.
Only time consuming part was making the meatballs.
But I make this at least once a month.

Very good! Needed salt, though! I recommend adding a few teaspoons to the mixture. The meatballs tasted better alone than they did on the sandwich, which is why this is a four-star recipe. I will definitely be making the meatballs again.

This was good, but it was only until after we starting eating I realized something was wrong. There was NO salt in the meat! How bizarre. The meatballs were definitely lacking in flavor.

Not a recipie that I would make again. Quick and easy doesn't always make up for lack of flavor. Meatballs were just okay, sauce from a jar is so-so. After eating half of the sandwich I tried to dress it up with some sliced black olives, peperochini rings and diced green pepper. That helped a little. Not something that I would serve to guests or care to eat again myself. Was worth trying though.

Excellent.  These have a great flavor.  I used 2 small eggs and added some chopped onion.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  We loved them and will be making them often since this is a quick lunch and much better than cooking my meatballs for 2 hours in sauce!  Thanks!

This recipe makes phenomenal meatballs, although I skip a huge step and just buy Classico's Spicy Tomato & Basil sauce instead of making it myself. I also use 3 cloves of garlic, 1 T of cilantro instead of parsley, 3 T Parmesan, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp chili powder, and 2 beaten eggs in the meat mixture. I also use Italian bread crumbs, and leave out the Italian seasoning. I end up making about 19-20 meatballs, and fry them in 2 T of olive oil for 5 minutes, and then add in a jar of the sauce and let them cook in that for about another 10-15 minutes, until the meat is well cooked. They're amazingly good!

My kids and husband loved this meal.  They snapped up the sandwiches like crazy.  My 6 year old pronounced my the best cook ever.  This  will be a regular in our household.
I doubled the recipe right away and froze the extra meatballs as suggested.  Next time I will add a layer of pepperoni in the sandwich.

A very good recipe. It's a keeper! I used two eggs instead. I added the sauce to the meatballs and had them in the oven a lot longer. Turned out great! I love it with pasta instead of bread :)

This was an excellent meatball recipe simple and easy but very tasty nonetheless. I followed the recipes exactly except for the addition of onion powder and a little fresh cracked black pepper. Wonderful!!! A little warning though, these are very filling so if your not looking for something hearty and filling you might want to pass this one by. Thank for the recipe!!

Well, I guess I cheated when making this recipe because I already had leftover meatballs in the freezer, which made this a snap to make.  What I particularly liked about this recipe was the olive oil, garlic powder and the pinch of salt added to the bread.  In my opinion, that took this sandwich up a notch.

Best meatballs ever! My boyfriend loves them and begs me to make them more often. I used this recipe to make meatballs to put in spaghetti too.  They're so tasty! The only reason its getting 4/5 stars is because I find that I have to cook them a bit longer than mentioned in the recipe.

Best meatball sandwiches! I also made a few changes as other reviewers did but changed it a bit to our taste:  3 tbs parmesan, 2 eggs, 4 cloves minced garlic, 3 (spicy) Italian sausage links.    :)

This is an awesome meatball recipe! They are so delicious and juicy. I could eat them w/o the sandwich. The whole sandwich is great too. Definitely keeping this one for a long time.

This was a delicious meal! To speed up time I used frozen Simek meatballs, and WoW was it delicious! It only took me about 15 minutes to make - tops! I will definitely keep this in my recipe box. Picture No. 48.

The meatballs in this recipe were delicious. The first night we had them on whole wheat hoagies with provolone cheese and the second night we had them with spaghetti. They are versatile and so tasty.

WOW!  These were awesome to say the least!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I rolled the mixture into 25 smaller meatballs instead of 12 large ones.  Baked in the oven then let them simmer in spaghetti sauce for 20 minutes.  5+ stars!!

Everyone from age 8-82 in my family loved this.  My 8 year old previously didn't like meatballs but now he's a believer!  I don't know what more you would want out of meatballs.  The only change I made was to use ground turkey and people said you could not tell it was turkey.  We ate this on Italian bread (both white and wheat Italian) with provolone cheese.

This is excellent and I followed the recipe exactly.  I recommend dipping the meatballs in the sauce and then just putting a light drizzle after the meatballs are placed on the bread - any more that that and it will be soggy....you'll have a few ounces of sauce unused.  20-25 minutes for the meatballs was right on.  Also I trenched out both top and bottom of the bread because the meatballs are large.  I did have 1 meatball left over.  I also put foil on the pan for the meatballs and the one for the bread which helped a lot with cleanup.  This will easily feed 4 people with sides.

This was my first time making meatballs.  It was so simple and my husband loved it.  I wasn't able to use fresh garlic or parsley, but it still turned out great.  I did let the meatballs cook for a little longer-about 20 minutes.  Next time I will use fresh parsley and garlic and it will be even better.  What a great recipe.

The best meatballs I have ever had. I use a small ice-cream scoop so I get 25 meatballs per lb.  I made these for sandwiches and for spaghetti & meatballs.  This is now a household favorite!

Awesome!  I'll admit that I had to use garlic powder and dried parsley, as I didn't have fresh on hand, but even with those changes, this is one great meatball recipe.  My family loved it!

Loved it ! I forgot to transfer the meatballs to the sauce .. I just placed them on the bun and poured the sauce on top. Next time I will put them in the sauce for a few minutes. I also used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. I will also add more spice next time, maybe some franks red hot or something.

Don't change a thing.. this is a excellent and easy  recipe to follow.        I used lean Moose hamburg..  slow cooked it in the crock pot with Marinara sauce. I tripled the   recipe and made a huge batch.    The flavor of the meatballs are awesome!

I made these for our Christmas get-together, and they were a huge hit! I tripled the recipe, adding 1 lb of sausage to the mix. I made my own Italian herb bread for the sandwiches. There was enough for lunch today, and they were just as good, if not better than yesterday. I did bake the meatballs as directed, then transfered to a crockpot, where I added the sauce and simmered 2 hours. Great recipe, especially for feeding a large group. I'll definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't do the sandwich ( I plan on trying that eventually) but just used the meatball recipe for spaghetti. Very slight changes:
I used ground turkey, added about a tablespoon more cheese and I put a little oil in a pan and sauteed them then added the sauce after 20+ min and let them simmer 10 min more. They were very tasty!

Excellent and easy!  I added a little white wine to the meatballs to make sure they stayed moist, and cooked them for about 30 minutes.  Other than that, the only change I made was to use pre-shredded Italian mix cheese.  Thanks for the recipe, we really enjoyed these!

DELICIOUS!!!

I made the meatballs to freeze, but my husband and I both snitched a couple of them before I packed them into the freezer. They are flavorful and incredibly delicious. The kitchen smelled great when they were cooking!!!

The only change I'll make next time will be to use leaner meat - they were a little greasy after they cooked.

Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I have made this five times now and every person who has tried them has loved them. They are very simple to put together and it doesn't take long at all. I add an additional sprinkle of italian seasoning sometimes but the recipe is great as is!

Tasty recipe.  Very easy.  I used ground turkey to make the meatballs just to cut down on the fat.  20 minutes baking time was just right.  Served with a green salad.  Will make again.

This was delicious!!! They were great meatball subs. I also made 24 meatballs, rather than 12 and cooked them for about 35 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe again!!

I followed this recipe almost to the letter.  I had to use 2 eggs to get the right consistency to form the meatballs and I added extra Parmessan cheese (because we love cheese) to the meatball mixture.  I also omitted the Italian seasoning because I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead and added just a pinch of oregano.  I got 24 walnut sized meatballs instead of 12 and it took about 35 minutes to bake the meatballs at 350 degrees.  I also sprinkled a little powdered garlic bread seasoning and extra Pamesan cheese on the french bread before baking it for just a little bit more flavor.  The sandwiches are very good, but very messy.  Have lots of napkins on hand when you eat these!  I will be using the extra meatballs and sauce for spaghetti tonight.  I love recipes when I only have to cook once but get 2 different meals for my efforts.  Boil some noodles, heat up the meatballs and sauce, serve with a green salad, and voila, a whole nother meal with almost no effort!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  We'll be having these often!

This was SUPER good, but I did take another member's suggestion an add two eggs instead of one and I also used a half pound of Italian sausage and a half pound of ground meat.

Yum!  I made this last night and it was excellent - a huge hit!  I made a few changes based on ingredients on hand - I used 1/2 lb. extra lean ground turkey and 1/2 lb. reduced fat ground italian sausage (jimmy dean) instead of the beef.  I also had to substitute 1/2 of the bread crumbs with quick oats (thought I had enough crumbs but ran out in the middle :)).  I made 36 meatballs, baked for 20 minutes, then put them in the sauce.  We ate them on toasted hamburger buns with a little mozzarella cheese - next time we will definitely try the baguette!  These would also be excellent over spaghetti, I imagine!

This recipe saved us - we needed something to bring in for lunch that was going to be quick to throw together.  It took about 10 minutes to make the meatballs then another 25 to bake (after 20 minutes they were still not all cooked through - need to use the meat thermometer next time).  Definitely a delicious and moist meatball!  Didn't bother with the garlic powder and toasting since I'm at work. The garlic is prominent, surprisingly with only 2 cloves.  This barely made 4 sandwiches for us so I would double this recipe next time. I only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs on hand so I didn't include the Italian seasoning.

Brilliant - the whole family loved them. I used shredded mozarella and omitted the Italian seasoning from the meatballs but sprinkled the grow ups sandwiches with dried basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes before returning to the oven to melt the cheese

I pretty much followed the meatball recipe except for the Italian seasoning, I just used fresh herbs from my garden, and put a bit more Parmesan cheese. I baked the meatballs in the oven exactly 20 min. Then put them in the crock with the sauce and let them simmer on low for a couple hours. They were very good. I'm not a fan of meatball sandwiches and only made these for my husband and boys. I think the meatballs would be great in a pasta dish.

I took the ideas from others and just used hoagie rolls as I was making in mass for a party.  They were Fantastic!  The party was all in-laws, I loved impressing them with these.  I also made the meatballs a lot smaller (again like others), for every 12 the recipe suggested, I made 24.

Delicious and easy to make.  I had most everything on hand except fresh parsley & baguette so I used dried parsley & long soft rolls.  I drizzled olive oil on rolls and toasted them lightly on griddle.  Fast and simple.

I stuck very close to the original recipe and it was a huge hit.  The only changes I made were to substitute shredded mozzarella for provolone because it's what I had on hand.  I also made the meatballs a bit smaller I guess, since I ended up with more than twelve.  I think this is an excellent meatball recipe without any tweaking.  Each time I make it now, I make a double batch so I can freeze half for spaghetti or more meatball subs in the future.

I just have to say that I made these last night and they were delicious. I did make a change in that I used ground turkey (it's all I had) in place of the ground beef, but otherwise everything was the same and so, so, so good. My daughters boyfriend just got home from college and stopped by here at dinner time. He was a happy boy.

This was my first try at meatballs and tasting a meatball sandwich.  I was very pleased with the ease of the recipe, it was very quick too!  I always thought meatballs would be a very time consuming thing to make.  These sanwiches were a huge hit with my husband, my 3 year old daughter and me.  The recipe will go in my favorites for dinner!  I did double the italian seasoning and eggs per other reviewers suggestions and found the meatballs very tasty, not overpowered by seasoning.  I also added garlic powder and onion powder.  Fast and delicious, a meal that makes it look like you worked a long time to make it!

Quick tip, for more juicy flavorable  meatballs - after meatballs are formed roll in additional bread crumbs and bake in muffin tins turning them once or twice for uniform browning.

I would of liked this sandwich better if the meatballs had more flavor. I will make again, but will add finely chopped onion, 1/2 the ground beef and add sweet italian sausage and salt & pepper at least.

These sandwiches were awesome!  I made the 24 smaller size balls and cooked them on the stovetop in a large saute pan with a little bit of olive oil. I used 2 eggs and increased the garlic and parm cheese, and added blk pepper & onion powder. I always make my own sauce and poured it over the meatballs and let them simmer in it for about 15 min. I also added pepperoni slices to the mix and topped the sandwiches with shredded mozzarella instead of provalone. Great flavor, even the 4-yr old liked 'em!! UPDATE: These are just as good after being frozen and re-heated for leftovers.  The kiddo actually asked for them, said he wants to eat them every night.

Following the advice of other reviewers I changed the recipe ever so slightly based on my preferences (more garlic, provolone, etc.) but even the basic recipe is tasty.  For a healthier alternative I did use ground turkey and although not as tasty as the beef, it'll work and it's better for the heart!  Also, I am used to smaller meatballs so I actually use a measuring spoon (Tbsp) to roll out perfect 1-inch or so meatballs.    It may sound weird but it works really well - and they all come out basically the same shape and size (pretty fool proof!).

PS: Add some cayenne pepper for some zing!

Meatball recipe, fantastic!  My family loved these large meatballs.  I used super lean ground beef and they were not swimming in grease, actually there was no grease at all.  I also added cayanne.  This was quick and easy, will do again and again.

I tried these tonight for dinner. I used dried parsley in place of fresh and shredded swiss cheese as it was my preference. I also used french bread instead of the baguette.
I added my own flavorings to the hamburger including chopped onion, salt, pepper, and some onion powder. I browned the meatballs in a skillet and then let them simmer in the tomato sauce for awhile. 
They were delicious! I liked them a lot as well as my husband. He had 2nd helpings.
My only complaint was that I think the meatballs really could have used a 2nd egg to hold together better. I'm not sure if it was because I fried them instead of baking them but, I had to be extremely careful or they would fall apart.
It's not really a biggie though, I'll just add another egg the next time I make them, which will be soon I am sure.
Thanks for the great recipe!

The meatballs tasted very good, but a bit bland.  Next time I will add a little seasoning salt or something of that likeness.  I also used 2 eggs like most of the other raters suggested.

My family loved the nice and firm texture of these meatballs and the parsely added a whole new dimension for us. We've never put parsily in before it gives the meatball a nice fresh pop.

I loved this meatball recipe. I used 2 eggs and garlic and onion powder to taste, a little salt and pepper and stir brand Italian bread crumbs. I make my own sauce. I also browned the balls before baking for 20 minutes. So good!

I love this recipe!! I used hoagie rolls to make them individually.  I also added salt and pepper to the meatballs and more parmesan.  One egg was sufficient. I baked them about 25 minutes and it made about 14 meatballs. Yum!

From the positive comments, I knew this was a good recipe, so I decided to make enough meatballs to freeze.  I used 3 lbs of hamburger and 1 lb of mild Italian sausage.  I then quadrupled the other ingredients for the meatball mixture, then cooked 12 of them (30 minutes, not 20) and put the others on a waxpaper-lined baking tray in the freezer.  After 2 hours, I took the frozen meatballs out and packaged them 12 to a package using my handy-dandy Food Saver (freezer bags would work fine).  Now I have 3 more dinners worth of meatballs for sandwiches or spaghetti.  Some comments said they added salt to this recipe.  I'm a salt lover, and I didn't think it needed additional salt.  I have always bought frozen meatballs in the past, but I'll be making my own from now on....these are so easy and taste so much better!! Thanks for a really good recipe!!

I used a 20 oz. package of ground turkey, and ussed other viewers' suggestions...3 t. Italian seasoning, 3 cloves garlic, 3 T. Parmesan, 2 eggs, and 1 t. pepper.  Unfortunately, I also took someone's suggestion to add salt.  I added about 1/2 t., and I thought they were too salty.  Next time, I'd use a bigger jar of spahetttig sauce, since we didn't have enough for everyone.  Used the market's bolillo rolls instead of a baguette.  We'll use mozzarella next time, instead of provolone.

The meatballs came out well, perfectly moist I added salt and pepper to the meat and I felt it could have even used a bit more salt. The italian seasoning is prominent but not overpowering. I added worcestershire sauce and dried onion. We (my 6, 4yo, husband and myself) liked this. I used american cheese because I was out of provolone which I have used for other subs on the past, and I think it tasted better that way even :)

I found there was too much bread crumbs.  I love provolone cheese, but it did not compliment sandwich as the taste of cheese is too powerful and adds a bitter taste to sandwhich.

This was a delicious sandwich. I will definitely be using this recipe for meatballs for other dishes. The only complaint I have is the bread. I am never using a French baguette again. It was hard to cut, too small to really fit the balls in, and difficult to work with. Next time I'll use regular French bread or hoagies like a lot of other reviews suggest.

Great recipe! I made this several times. We like it better with only 1/2 t of italian seasoning (2t was too strong for me) & used 2t of dried parsley instead of fresh (only because hubby dislikes fresh).

These meatballs were just OK.  I didn't use that much bread crumbs after reading others comments, they weren't dry at all.  Just OK! though.

I've never made homemade meatballs before but this was a really good start even though my husband thought they were a little bland.  Next time I'll have to adjust the ingredients.  Maybe add some spices here & there..

The texture of these meatballs is really tough, even after a long simmer in sauce.  Too many breadcrumbs is what I suspect.

A good basic recipe for a quick and easy version of a meatball sandwich, but the recipe could use some tweaking. The meatballs were pretty bland and needed additional seasonings, and of course, using a rich homemade marinara-type sauce and freshly baked bread is much preferrable to the recipe's shortcuts. If you're short on time and just need a quick meatball sub fix, this is a perfectly acceptable recipe, but it definitely didn't 'wow' us. Not great, not terrible. Might make again if we made some changes and only used the recipe as a baseline.

This was great!  I used white sub rolls and cut out a little of the center so the meatballs would fit.  I only used one slice of provolone per sandwich...next time I will probably use two to make it a little cheesier.  I also used a spicy marinara sauce for a little extra kick! My husband loved this and it was easy to make!

All in all, a pretty good recipe.  Might have been so much better if I didnt burn the baguettes, everything had a burnt aftertaste to it that wasn't appealing.  My bad.

These sandwiches were delish! Next time we might mix some sauce with the meat because they were a little dry on the inside, but overall, they were great! We will be eating these again soon!

This was good, but I still enjoy Italian sausage meatballs better.  However, I will use this when I only have ground beef on hand as they were tasty.  Did make some changes however, so the review is based on the changes I made per other reviewers.  Used 2 eggs, 3 T parmesean cheese and 1 1/2 tsp minced onion.  Used 3 tsp Italian seasoning, but it was too much.  Will go back to recipe and use 2 tsp again.  Cooked at 350 for 35 min.

Mama Mia, this is delicious and so easy that even I can make it!! The only differences were I just made the meatballs (not the bread) and I used 1 lb of ground turkey instead of beef! Also I used mozzarella cheese instead of Parmesan! I used an off-brand spaghetti sauce and it was fabulous so I can't wait to try it with some of Newman's Own Sauce!! I will use this recipe for meatballs from now on!! Thanks, BIGGUY278!! My husband is a "big guy", too!! They make the best cooks!!

This rating is for the meatballs only.  I like to make the gravy that my family has made for years.  I make a double batch of the meatballs, freeze them on a cookie tray, then bag.  It lets me add just what I need to my pasta dinner.   Thanks for the great meatball recipe.

Good for meatball sandwiches...no doubt.  I prefer a meatball that absorbs a bit more of the tomato sauce, and this recipe does not do that.  Next time I will probably prepare the meatballs as indicated but will let them cook in the spaghetti sauce longer.

Day 1: I used 1 1/3lb meat, added milk to the breadcrumbs and Worcestershire sauce to the meat.  For the sauce, I sauteed a medium size onion added 28 oz of jarred sauce, one can of diced tomatoes and salt/pepper.  After 17 min in the oven, I transferred the meatballs to the sauce and allowed to simmer while the bread ("Soft Sandwich Buns" formed into jumbo hoagies) warmed.  I found the meatballs to be a little bland, but overall the sandwiches were a nice treat.  Day 2: I reheated the meatballs with some extra tomato sauce and served over spaghetti with toasted garlic bread.  The meatballs were much better after hanging out in the sauce overnight.  I will make this again, with the addition of some salt to the meatballs.

These meatballs are delicious.  I added 1/2 a yellow onion to the meat mixture as well an extra teaspoon of italian seasoning, an extra clove of garlic, and I used italian style bread crumbs.  I used Grandma's Meat Sauce (from allrecipes) without any meat in the sauce for my red sauce, and dropped these meatballs in with some homemade pasta.  The meatballs were bursting with flavor, make sure you use FRESH parsley, keep the meatballs about the size of a golf ball and don't overcook them, these will not disappoint.

This recipe has become a staple in our house, so much so that my teenage sons friends are now coming over for dinner just for meatball subs!!  The meatballs have a wonderful flavor and are so easy to make in a big batch to freeze.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were really YUMMY! I did add extra seasonings to it as some of the other reviewers suggested and used toasted garlic bread to serve these. Also a tip---my ice cream scoop made the perfect size meatballs. Once they were cooked, I cut them in half and made the sandwich. This made them stay on the bread better.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

This is a very good recipe as written but I did make a few changes there after. I agree, with other reviewers, it definately needs two eggs. I also used half beef and half pork, added 1/2 cup mozzarella, one small minced onion, several bulbs of roasted garlic and a few red pepper flakes for a little heat. The recipe doubles easily and the meatballs freeze great. I've used them in spaghetti and sliced into lasagna. My husband "loves" them sliced on a deli roll with carmalized peppers and onions, a little giardiniere and provolone cheese melted on top.

The only thing I changed was stuffing with string cheese. Cut into 1/4 inch pieces and formed the meatballs around the cheese.

I loved this recipe! The meatball recipe is just perfect. Like most reviewers, I adjusted the quantities of the seasonings: adding 3 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 3 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons minced onion, and pinch of salt and black pepper. For the last step, I put the meatballs on one side of the french bread and topped it with fresh mozzarella cheese. I put it in the broiler for approximately 5 minutes when the cheese started to bubble. It was delicious!

These were great. Only changes were that I added a little more Italian seasoning and cooked in crock pot with the sauce all day on low. Served on homeade baguettes.

These meatballs are stellar! I rated them 4 stars because they needed more seasoning but overall these were delicious! The leftover meatballs freeze really well and are super easy to heat up and use in Spaghetti, Lasagna, Meatball subs, or even just a quick snack!

This was a great find.  The meatballs were to die for.  My husband thought there was a little to much italian seasoning, but liked them.  Not only is this a good meal idea the homemade meatballs make a great addtion to manicotti.

This was great, instead of buying on big French baguette, I bought a bag of french sandwich rolls.  The only thing I'll change for next time is either make my own sauce, or buy a much better sauce.

These were ok. I think what really did it for me was the provolone cheese.  That is a must have.

This recipe was just okay. Bland actually. No salt in the recipe and the grated cheese didn't offer much salt either. The italian spice addition was a let down. I think basil and oregano would be enough on their own.

the family agrees on this one. too much parsley too much italian seasonings needs another egg, some salt(possibly onion), some pepper, a longer cook time, mozzarella cheese instead of provolone ect. hopefully someone has or will post a better recipe.

Absolutely perfect!!  I used venison instead of ground beef, because that is what I had thawed and you could not even tell it was venison! - which is a major plus in my book.
The flavor was wonderful!  everyone loved it!  thank you!

It was really good.  The cooking time for the meatballs is wrong however.  It takes about half an hour for the meatballs to cook, at least.  Since there are 12 of them and they are quite large!

I've made this recipe twice now and the first time I thought they needed more seasoning so I upped it just a bit and they were really good. I put them in sauce and let them simmer for an hour after cooking them. I usually just use ground beef in my sauce when making spaghetti but this was a welcome change and a hit with my husband.

I used 2 lbs. of beef and made 40 meatballs.  I was only looking for a meatball recipe so I did not make sandwiches out of these.  The meatballs were very good though.

Now, that's a good meatball! I made this with the baguettes from this site. It was so easy and very good! I wanted to double the recipe, but didn't have enough beef, so I used pork, too. (I put both meats in the meat grinder with a couple cloves of garlic.) I didn't use parsley beacuse I didn't have any, but that would have just made it better if I had. I did add a little salt and a little onion powder. For the parmesan cheese, I used a fresh grated parmesan and romano mixture. And, for the bread crumbs, I didn't know if the recipe meant to use dried or fresh, so I grated a couple of slices of the wheat bread I made a couple days ago. As for the sauce, I just made my own quick sauce, with a spaghetti sauce mix packet and my own additions. My pikiest eater asked me to rate this 5 stars, I agree!  Great Recipe! I will definately make this again!

Delicious!  I make these meatballs for family gatherings at our house and they are always very popular- I cook the meatballs and then transfer them to a crockpot with the sauce and people make their own sandwiches.

This was an okay recipe.  I made it for my 10 year daughter's birthday.  She absolutely loved it, but the rest of us thought the meatballs were a bit dry.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I may try it again but adjust the ingredients to make them moister.

This meatball sub was EXCELLENT!!! Didn't have olive oil so I used butter/Country Crock to spread on the bread. Very easy. Make sure you season your ground beef and sauce well. Those are the keys to a great tasting sub. I'm from Louisiana so I use Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning instead of salt for the meatballs and no egg (just forgot). Added a bay leave to sauce before slightly simmering. I put a little sauce on the bread first, then the provolone cheese followed by meatballs and sauce and topped off with some Parmesan I had left over.  Put back in oven on broil for 1 1/2 to melt cheese. Makes ya wanna stop buying meatball subs cause of its taste and simplicity!

Fan-freaking-tastic!  I wish I could give this recipe 20 stars. I had it last night and it was PERFECT.  My husband made it, so it must be easy.  He did call me and say "I've been looking for the French baguette in the spice rack for 20 minutes and it's just not in there!"  But that's my husband, not yours, so you should be ok.  Anyway, this is the best recipe ever, delivering moist, flavorful meatballs and amazing taste.

I think this recipe is pretty good, and would definately make again, but next time would not use this kind of bread--I think it was too hard. Toasted hoagies would probably work better.

Great recipe! I used 1 lb. ground beef and an egg white, cut back a bit on the bread crumbs (about 1/2 cup), added some red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick. I also got about 24 meatballs out of it. Very tasty...thanks!

I think I may be the first one disappointed with this recipe.  First off, I followed this recipe to a T.  When making it, I double checked the one egg quite a few times; although it seemed odd, I never baked my meatballs before so I went with it.  The flavor of the meatballs were decent, but they were so dry.  You definitely need to add more egg.  Thanks for sharing, but I think I will stick to my personal recipe per my hubby's request.

Delicious! I omitted the parsley (we don't like it), added a couple of tbsps of very finely chopped onion (was in the fridge, and needed using up), and I made it with some nice plump Hoagie rolls (the French baguettes at the store were very thin and rather sorry-looking). Was very pleased with the results. Thanks, BIGGUY728!

It's Monday night and no dinner in sight!  I refer to my recipe box and find this recipe.  I rush to the grocery store and am home by 7:00 to watch "SURFACE".  In 40 minutes we are eating cheesy meatball subs that even my picky nine year old likes!

EASY, TASTY and QUICK!

I made this for my girlfriend the other day. I skipped the parsley and used mozz cheese rather than prov, but it still came out great. we made them into grinders. she loved it and even had a few extra meatballs after. it was a total success! she now prefers this recipe over the pizza shop down the street. love it!

I used all garlic powder, made the bread crumbs fresh, and didn't use garlic. I also used regular wheat bread instead of the baguette and shredded cheese instead of provolone. The sandwich still tasted fantastic! The meatballs are so delicious.

So good!!! This has become my go-to meatball reciepe. Only change is adding finely diced onion- that really adds freshness to the flavor. Nice and moist yet firm and they freeze well too if you double it. If you make the sandwich buy the correct bread so you have the correct sizing of bread to meatball, otherwise it'll fit weird. Sounds like common sense but the first time I made this I was like, French bread will be fine. Still tasted food but the texture was off and MBs didn't fit right- my fault entirely. Thanks for sharing this great reciepe- my boys request it often.

I have made this twice. The first time it seemed a bit bland and my husband wasn't too impressed. The second time I added some lightly sautéed onion and a little extra Italian seasoning, parmesan cheese and garlic (just 1 extra clove). I also made sure I got plenty of garlic powder and salt on the bread when I brushed it with olive oil. Lastly, I put provolone on one side of the bread and then parmesan on the other (then broiled for a min in the oven to melt well). This time I also served with an extra bowl of sauce for people to scoop or dip in as necessary. This time I got RAVE reviews and will absolutely be using this recipe, with those few changes, again.  Like a few others, I mused the individual hoagie type rolls as well and they worked out very nicely - after they were scooped out they held the meatballs nicely and were manageable to eat.

To me, the meatballs need some ground pork, adds to the flavor and juiciness of the meatball. So mine were 1.lbs of beef and 1.lbs of homemade garlic sausage.(I also needed to make more than the recipe for a game day spread) the rest is basically the same, more cheese,basil and parsley. Other than that not a bad recipe to build off of to make it your own.

Delicious!  I used 1 lb ground beef(90%-10%), 1/2 lb ground pork and 1/2 lb. ground hot Italian sausage meat. Basically used 1 1/2 times the other ingredients rather than doubling them.  I did use 2 eggs though. Made 36 meatballs for subs. Baked in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes on a broiler pan to reduce the grease (as per another reviewer). Will refrigerate overnight then put in crock pot with marinara sauce (from our fav Italian store) early tomorrow for the 1:00 game.  Can't wait to try the finished product because they were great straight from the oven without any sauce!

This was a delicious recipe. My parents truly enjoyed it. But I did make changes: for the beef, I used unseasoned bread crumbs so I could season them to my taste and added extra 1/4 of it for extra crunch. I added 1/8 C of peppers, 1/8 C of minced onions, and 4 cloves of mashed garlic. I added about a tablespoon of steak sauce, and I didn't used garlic salt (but used both of them separately). I added a bit of hot sauce, 2 teaspoons of ground oregano, and I cooked them for 25 minutes the night before. I substituted the baguette for Portuguese rolls because the baguette was too hard after baking it. I used Italian cheese blend instead of provolone. And with the sauce, I sautéed some peppers, onions, garlic, oregano, Italian seasoning, plum tomatoes, in a bit of olive oil. Then added salt to taste. And instead of using plain spaghetti sauce, I used Francesco Rinaldi's Sweet & Tasty tomato sauce. I let it simmer a bit. Afterwards  I added the meatballs. I know I did a lot of changes but they were well worth it as they came out fantastic. Thanks!

Amazing!!  I doubled the recipe and added a pound of sweet Italian sausage instead of the second pound of ground beef. And I cooked them in a mini muffin tin for ease of scooping out. My kids and husband loved it!

YUM!  I made a few changed.  I used 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp Mediterranean herb seasoning and 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/4 c. parmesan and two eggs.  I might add minced onion next time.  I also ended up with about 24 meatballs and cooked them 25 minutes (we don't like soggy meatballs).  I was busy so I put them in a bowl and then added them to the sauce at dinner time - great.  Used the leftovers the next day to add to the spaghetti!  Two meals in one!

I made this for a boyfriend that isn't a big fan of sopping amounts of cheese, although unfortunately (for him), I am. Despite his tastes, I made this with smaller meatballs, and more cheese... and he finished it an ADORED it. It's our go-to now for movie nights. Served it with a light salad (the sandwich was filling enough).

My only alteration to this recipe which I think perfected the meat balls was that I used shake n bake instead of bread crumbs for the meatballs. It added a bit of flavour and held them together quite well. One package was fine for the whole serving.

I don't usually like meatball subs, but really liked this recipe and so did my family.  I used dried parsley and would suggest to make 24 meatballs.  I thought the 12 were too big, so I cut them in half.  I still have enough for 4 more sandwiches, just need another loaf of bread.

Absolutely wonderful....made just as the recipe stated.  I did triple the recipe and used 1 pound of each...hamburger, bison, lamb.  Made a total of 31 meatballs.  Used hoagies, hollowed out.  Will make this over and over again.  Thanks for sharing an awesome recipe.

Delish.  Used saltines instead of bread crumbs and used hot dog buns and shredded italian cheese.  Just what we had on hand. Great basic meatball recipe to work with.

I followed directions as posted. The meatballs weren't as good as I'd hoped them to be. To me, they taste like frozen store bought. Too much filler (bread crumbs) for my taste. I won't be making these again and if I do, I'll use much less bread crumbs as directed.

Thesse turned out great! A lot of work for "meatball subs", but were excellent. Made extra and froze to use later with spaghetti. Weeknights are crazy for us, so home cooking is sometimes difficult. This was easy, yummy, and it made two meals in one! Thank you!

Excellent.  My only change is the meatballs take a full 30 minutes to cook; they were still partially raw after 20 minutes.  Also, make sure you have plenty of sauce on hand.  The bread soaks up a lot.  The baguette we got was rather large, so a full sub was four meals worth.

These were delicious!!  Based on previous reviews, I used 2 eggs, and took the breadcrumbs down to 1/2 cup.  I loved the seasoning in these and will definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I used ground turkey instead of beef, and substituted whole wheat club rolls in place of the baguette. Really cuts down on the calories! The meatballs have a really great flavor to them; I didn't change a thing with the spices! Also, they freeze and reheat wonderfully! Great recipe :)

These were fantastic.  I did add double the recipe and added 1 lb pork sausage but followed the rest.  My family loved these and they were so easy.  I froze the remainder and every week I am requested to make these.  Good bye sloppy joes, you have been replaced.

I had never made homemade meatball before this recipe because I thought they would be time consuming, but I have made these 3 times in 6 weeks, and they come out perfect.  Had I known they were extremely easy to make and tasted so fantastic, I would have made these years ago.  The first time I made it according to the directions and they are great, but since then I have increased the egg by 1, added minced onion, and a little milk--just for personal preference only.  I make these on the weekends and freeze them for use during the week while I am in school.  You will be asked to make these over and over--they have that much flavor and are so moist.  Thank you BIGGGUY728.

Just made these and DH says they are pretty stellar. He said they are so huge that they could be eaten as an open sandwich. I made the meatballs smaller so I too had 24 meatballs. I used left over spaghetti sauce that I had. It was a name brand spaghetti sauce that I had already browned beef up and added to it (with a splash of brown sugar). So my sauce was very hearty. I used mozzerella cheese too. Will be a keeper and DH will be taking the recipe to the fire house.

this recipe is great!  i followed the recipe for the meatballs and they came out tender, juicy and full of flavour! cooked for 2, so i halved the amount of meat and bread crumbs, but added the same amount of italian seasoning, parsley and egg. came out perfect! (:   thank you for the wonderful recipe! i served them on spaghetti instead and they were still great! (:

HOLY COW!!! These are sooo yummy!!! Sat. are reserved for "no fuss" meals around here.... My fiance & I went to the zoo 2day, so I didn't have much time to cook anyways. :) Using my 3 T PC scoop, I was able to make 14 decent-sized MB's. I used a jar of generic marinara sauce and, even tho it wasn't "gourmet," it worked well for this purpose. I used provolone cheese, but you can sub mozza or Italian-blend if you prefer. I DO think slices melt better than shreds tho.... Since I was making this for just my fiance & I, I 1/2'd my loaf of French bread (I'm saving the other 1/2 for subs this coming wk.!!!). I toasted my bread for 7 min. and, after melting my cheese for a few min., I broiled (HI) for a few more min. to get that bubbly n' brown layer that I love... mmmm! My only (minor) ch. were to add a sm. (minced) onion, s&p to taste & 1.5 eggs to my MB mix. (it seemed dry w/o it). My MB's only took 18 min. to cook thru (I cooked them on a rack set inside a roasting pan to avoid greasy MB's... eww!). My major ch. was to slather these babies w/ homemade garlic aioli (Jeff & Justine). THAT took this over the top, IMHO!!! Other than the MB's being "OK," (I'm gonna keep looking...), this recipe's a keeper! The technique alone is genius! I think I'll take JTCRIPPEN's advice to use the "guts" of my bread to make fresh crumbs next time (I had a can of them handy, so I didn't). Chips were a great (and easy!) side. Tx. BIGGUY! :-)

I was looking for a meatball recipe like I used to get when I lived up north as a child. This one came closest to what I remembered. I didn't have parsley, and I used ground venison and added a little milk, but these turned out great. I would serve them to my Italian friends.

THE MOST AMAZING MEATBALLS I'VE EVER MADE!! These came out perfect. I doubled the batch and did everything according to the directions but also adding salt and pepper to the meatballs which wasn't listed.  The whole sandwich turns out fantastic.  I used pam and garlic salt on french rolls and toasted in the oven as directed.  Be sure you make good sized meatballs so they're nice and juicy. I baked for 15 minutes... was absolutely perfect.  Followed this recipe to a T and these were the most delicious meatball sanwiches my boyfriend and I have ever had.  Will keep this around forever! Doubled the batch for some homeade spaghetti later this week!!

Mmmm, good!  Messy to eat; had to use a knife and fork because the meatballs kept falling out, but oh so tasty.

I used the italian cheese blend instead of provolone. Fantastic! I also had to use regular bread because I didn't have a baguette, but I know that it would have been waaay better with the baguette, because it would not have gotten soggy. Even without the baguette the flavor was awesome!

These are great but they have way too much bread crumbs.  I used a pound and a half of ground chuck and only a half cup of bread crumbs and still needed to add a little milk (almost a quarter cup) just to moisten the mixture.  The mixture was quite dry but the end product was great.  I made 6 sandwiches (due to the added half pound of meat) and used one jar of sauce and we felt it was the perfect sauce/meat ratio.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is one of my favorites. It is packed with deliciousness! I used lean ground turkey instead of ground beef, mozzarella cheese instead of provolone and omitted the garlic cloves (I didn't have any on-hand). The meatballs were a little dry, so next time I may add two eggs instead of one and I will let the meatballs simmer in the spaghetti sauce for a bit longer. I recommend this recipe to everyone!

These tasty meatballs are also quite good served on toasted ciabetta bread.  Not for the faint of heart as they make huge sandwiches but great for gameday appetites.

Yummy. I omitted the parsley and added minced onions instead. I also added italian seasoning to the sauce and some crushed red pepper flakes. These were good and my family loved them.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any dried Italian seasoning, so I poured in about a tablespoon of dried oregano.  I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder too.  I also had no spaghetti sauce, so I melted butter with garlic powder over the top of the bread the first time it went in the oven and then put the provolone cheese on and set the oven to broil.

These were very tasty subs. I had never had a meatball sub before. I'm glad I found this recipe. Even my toddler gobbled it up. Thanks for sharing. I made the meatballs in advance and froze them for a later dinner. The night before I was ready to use them, I just pulled them out to defrost and then finished the recipe as directed.

Great when used with venison!!  I followed other recommendations and added an extra teaspoon of italian seasoning, and added an extra egg (venison is so lean and I find the extra egg gives it a little bit more moisture).  I didn't have fresh parsley so only added 1 tsp.  It really was very good - both my picky daughter and husband ate this!

Very yummy, easy to make. Instead of provolone cheese, I sprinkled some mozzerella cheese on top (and did not stick it back in the oven). The cheese will melt on its own on top of the hot meatballs. The bread was great, nice and crispy. Be careful you don't put too much salt on the bread. Also, I baked it for 18 minutes. (5 minutes to bake/toast bread was perfect) And I ended up making about 15 meatballs because I didn't want to make them too big.

I used the meatball portion of this recipe for sandwiches. We both thought using spaghetti sauce out of a jar would not be as good as marinara. So we used the best marinara recipe from this sight and it's awesome! Thanks for a good base for all future meatballs.

These were great and really easy.  We made about 18 meatballs and cooked them for 25 minutes.  I added an extra egg and pepper and extra garlic b/c we love garlic.  The kids had seconds, so this is a keeper.  Next time I will add italian sausage to the ground beef to give it an extra kick.

DELICIOUS!  ALL I DID WAS TO DOUBLE THE RECIPE. ACTUALLY, THIS IS THE SAME AS MY MEATBALLS, BUT I USUALLY USE THE BEEF/PORK/VEAL COMBO-----THIS TIME IT WAS ALL BEEF. WILL USE THE REMAINDER WITH PASTA. I APPRECIATE THE REMINDER THAT GUYS REALLY DO LOVE MEATBALL BOMBERS.....I JUST USUALLY JUST MAKE MEATBALLS TO GO WITH PASTA.

This is for the meatballs only- mine came out too dry and too bland. Needed salt and pepper and a few minutes less cooking time. Used 90/10 meat and followed directions exactly. I like baking them though instead of frying, will adjust and try again.

This is my favorite meatball recipe.  It makes 18-24 meatballs for us.  The only other change I make is adding a little cracked red pepper.  Very tasty!

Great meatball sandwich!  I'm just starting to cook to suprise my wife and I needed something easy that would taste good too- this worked!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and less cheese to make it a bit healthier- it was a big hit in my house!

I've tried so many different recipes for meatballs and this is the best.  It worked with regular (80%) beef and (90%)lean beef.  The meatballs were used for spaghetti sauce and they were perfect. I did make them smaller for the sauce but just perfect.  It was so easy!

Amazingly delicious. I'm not big on meat but even I have to admit these were mind blowing meatballs. Will definitely be making this again for my meat loving father :)

I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make it and this turned out good but me and my husband felt that it needed something. I will make again but may try some other reviews next time. Thanks.

I was in a hurry so I used frozen meatballs. Toasing the bread and then putting the garlic olive oil mixture is a must! It's what makes this recipe better than normal meatball sandwiches.

Bravo for a fantastic easy-to-make weeknight meal! I used the majority of the ingredients, but I added in: sliced bell peppers, lettuce and shredded parmesan cheese. This was really easy to make and my bf loved it, too! A+!

Not as good as I was hoping.  I did add extra seasoning to the meatballs as others suggested but think I should have added more.  It was definitely easy but if I ever make it again I will make my own sauce and add even more seasoning to the meatballs.

These were so good.  I wanted a meatball recipe I could make in the oven versus frying and this fit the bill.  The only changes I made was a served on individual french rolls, adn I used mozerella cheese as I felt it was a better fit, I also used carmelized onion and garlic flavored sauce for an extra kick.  The only thing I will do differently is I will let the meatballs set up in the sauce a bit longer to get more flavor, but they were still fantastic!

This was a great meatball. next time i would add more seasoning.  i like alot of flavor and this was lacking but if i had just added a bit more of the spices it would have gotten 5 stars!

i made a bunch of these meat balls with the plan of freezing them for future easy spaghetti dinners. the recipe yields more like 20 balls which is great for lots of future meals. i'm taking a star off for flavor....they needed a little more "umf".
Substitutions for Added Flavor:
-sub the ground beef with 1/2 beef + 1/2 pork
-bread crumbs (use the italian seasoned breadcrumbs, not plain)
-2 eggs instead of 1
-4 cloves of garlic instead of 2-
-more then just a pinch of salt

delicious I made these to go in spaghetti but I wish I had made it into a sandwich the meatballs were scrumptious. I did do half pork and half beef and I did not brush with olive oil, the meat balls provided plenty of oil themselves. Oh and I threw some chopped moz into the mix, you can't ever have too much cheese

It may have been my brand of breadcrumbs or italian seasoning but I didn't care for the taste of the meatballs. Everyone else said they had no taste.

These are always a winner with my whole family.  I always make them small and server them on hot dog buns.  I mince onion, slice olives and shred mozzerella for the most amazing toppings.  Perfect!

With suggestions from other users, this recipe turned out perfect! I made the meatballs the night before and the next morning baked them for 15 minutes then transferred them to a crockpot with my own sauce. The were moist, tender and held their shape perfectly. And the taste...incredible. I won't make meatballs any other way!

Great meatball recipe!  I made a triple batch ahead of time for a large party and froze them.  The day of the party I put them in my crockpot with sauce and heated all day.  They turned out yummy!

These meatballs have a soft texture that complements a sandwich because they flatten slightly and hold together when you bite into it, making the 12 large meatball size fine. I used fine fresh breadcrumbs from two slices of stale firm bread. I made the mistake of using a packaged soft hoagie roll which became soggy...next time I'll use a good crunchy roll if not the bagette. The final flavor is largely influenced by whatever sauce you choose, but this is a nice complete method for a hearty sandwich.

It was delicious. I give it 5 stars because my husband said," Honey if its not too much trouble could you make a few more of these so I can take to work for the guys. I havent had a good meatball sandwich in a while. This hit the spot!" The only thing I did different was making the meatballs a bit smaller. The larger ones are too big for the kids to fit in their mouths. Very delicious, will make again.

Super easy!  I recommend not using Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I didn't like the flavor that turned out from doing that.  My rating is based on how quick and easy this was to prepare.  If it was on taste alone, I probably would have given this one 3 stars.  The meatballs reminded me of the ready made meatballs you can buy in a bag at the store.

Excellent meatballs!  I made these with lean ground beef and added extra parmesan, garlic, egg and salt as recommended by other reviewers.  I baked them then added to a crockpot with spaghetti sauce to cook for two hours on low.  They were a hit at my luncheon!  Thanks for posting.

This was a good easy dinner, cheap too!  Actually this was the first meatball sandwich I'd ever had!  I can't say I was impressed, I prefer much more flavor but can work on that!  Will be making often!

This was great - I made 12 meatballs, but next time I will make 24 smaller ones. I cooked the meatballs in spaghetti sauce in the oven for 1 1/2 hours, and it added the best flavor to the sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

An excellent and simple recipe. Next time I will make smaller meatballs. I bought whole wheat baguette rolls and the meatballs were a little too big which made the sandwich hard to eat. But overall, the meatballs were tender, moist and well-seasoned. The sandwiches are definitely better if you spoon some extra sauce onto them! As a personal preference, I  used sliced mozzarella instead of provolone. This is definitely a keeper!

Oh my... this is the most wonderful meat ball sub I ever had. Yummmm!!!! I made 30 balls though. 12 balls are way too BIG and would never fit into my mouth and too BIG to put onto the bread. I will be making this again. Mmmmm

This is great.  My husband and I love this sandwich--delicious!  Next time I make it, though, I'd be sure to use lean ground beef.  I think I used 80 or 85% lean, and the meatballs were really greasy.  The grease doesn't really cook out.  Also, definitely make more meatballs--I made 20 out of this recipe and can't imagine having bigger ones.  And, I think I'd like the meatballs just a little crisp on the outside, so I cooked mine a little longer when warming up the leftovers, and I'll do that the next time--cook them longer or at a higher temp.  My husband thought they were fine as is.  Yummy!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I made these in my crock pot and they turned out perfect.  I cooked them for about 7 hours in Ragu Traditional Sauce.  Next time I might try using ground turkey.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I would recommend slicing the meatballs before putting them on the bread just for the ease of eating. I topped with spicy sliced banana peppers for more zip.

This recipe was so easy to make. I had no idea what a french baguette was so i just bought some bakery fresh sub rolls. I loved how the oil helped the sub rolls
The leftovers heated up great for lunch the next day

I made this recipe with leftover ground beef and hot dog buns from a barbecue, and I still have people talking about how delicious it was.  The seasonings and everything for the meatballs is what really makes this recipe so great.  It's great flavoring, and the meatballs are the perfect balance of juiciness yet dryness to hold together.  I used Italian bread crumbs rather than regular bread crumbs and then cut back on the Italian seasoning by about half.  I kept the rest of the seasonings in the same amount as the recipe.  Hope you enjoy the messy goodness as much as my family and friends did!

Very good! I used 2 eggs instead of 1 per reviews & forgot to add the garlic, oops. I had my husband shape 24 meatballs & they cooked for 15 mins. We used hoagie rolls, make sure to take a lot of the roll out. I could only fit 4 meatballs on the roll, good thing we made them small. I made my own sauce but I don't think that is really necessary. This was a very filling meal. We served it with a light salad. Thanks.

I was looking for a meatball recipe to make with spaghetti. I have never liked meatballs, but did give these a try and they are delicious! My husband said, "For someone who doesn't like spaghetti and meatballs, you make good spaghetti and meatballs!". The recipe made enough meatballs that we were able to use the leftovers for meatball sandwiches. I used pizza sauce and mozzarella on a sandwich roll. Delicious!

I found this recipe while doing a search for ground beef. I had some thawed out and didn't want it to go to waste. Now I did not have any grinder rolls to make this into a grinder. However.....I had Hamburger buns. So instead of making a whole bunch of meatballs, I turned them into 6 big meatballs and flattened them on the cookie sheet. I did not change any of the ingredients. I even followed the instructions for the bread (the olive oil, garlic powder, & salt)on the hamburger buns. It was wonderful.  My husband had 3 of them. Keep in mind he had gastric bypass surgery so he snacked on them throughout the night.

5 Stars!!!!

I thought this was very good.  The only change I made was to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the bread crumbs & Italian seasoning.  Next time I make this, I will probably make the meatballs smaller as they were a little big to bite into.

My whole family loved this recipe! I used frozen meatballs and shredded Italian cheese blend instead of Provolone. I also added a tablespoon of Emeril's Italian seasoning to the marinara sauce. Made a salad to go with it. Soooo Good!

Pretty good meatballs, I followed others suggestions by adding more seasonings (italian, onion and garlic)and cheeses (both parmesean and motz.). I think they would have been a little bland had I not done that. Whoever first had the idea to use a ice cream scoop was a genuis, all meatballs were same sized and cooked evenly.

Yummy!  I use to love meatball subs when I worked in Boston and had a great sub shop down the street, and I haven't been able to find a good recipe until now.  My husband is Italian and grew up on meatballs and is VERY particular and he said they were great too!  The only thing I did different was I kept my meatballs in the sauce for at least a half hour before prepping the sandwiches.  Delicious!  I will definitely make these again!

These were ok.  As suggested used hoagie rolls instead of the baguettes.  My son loved them and took home the leftovers.  I will probably not make these again.  Will use my tried and true meatloaf recipe to make meatball sandwiches in the future...

Ok, I am a college kid that doesn't cook anything that isn't microwavable or at least already prepped in the box, but this was the best thing I ever made.  I used extra lean ground beef which has about 85% less fat than regular ground round and it was not dry at all like most things extra lean beef dishes.  I also used a lower fat provolone and Ciabatta sandwich rolls and was able to cut the fat content to about  10 grams of fat per serving (still four servings) and about 450 calories as opposed to 50 grams of fat and 900+ calories.  Awesome recipe though, thanks.

Really great recipe!! I used flavored bread crumbs and skipped the Italian seasoning. Next time, however, I'll use more sauce. We like to drench things in sauce. This is the first time I've made my own meatballs. I'll never buy them at the store again. My visiting college student niece said, "If Subway could make their meatballs like this, I'd eat there every day." I used French bread and served open-faced. Thanks so much!!

We really enjoyed these sandwiches.  Changes I made to the recipe: used a softer bread, added minced onion and a little salt to the meat, and used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Like other reviewers I made about 20 smaller meatballs and had to cook them for around half an hour.  Great sandwiches and WONDERFUL left over.  Will definitely be making again!

This was delicious and very popular with my family.  The quality of the dish depends a lot on the quality of spaghetti sauce you use.  I followed a previous reviewer's advice and cooked the meatballs in the spaghetti sauce, in the slow cooker - very successful.

This is a great meatball recipe.  We love garlic so the more the better!  I did add chopped onions to it b/c we like onions.  Thank you for this recipe.  We have used it over and over!

Fantastic recipe. Made these for Father's day and they were a hit. I cooked the meatballs closer to 30 minutes. I only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs on hand so I omitted the Italian seasoning. Keeper recipe!!

Very tasty!  I bought 1.23 pounds of ground beef and it made about 15 VERY large meatballs so it took quite a bit longer to bake through.  I bought brat buns and shredded provolone to cut some time.

These are great. I've made them twice within the past 2 weeks. Both times I made them as spaghetti and meatballs and then use the leftovers to make meatball sandwiches. I had to leave the garlic and the seasoned crumbs (used plain) out the second time (our neighbors are allergic to garlic and onions) and they were still yummy. This will become my "go to" meatball recipe.

The whole family loved these meatball grinders! I did increase the seasoning as suggested (plus salt and pepper!) as well as added more parmesan and used thin sliced gouda cheese instead of provolone. Meatballs were so delicious I am sure I'll be using the recipe for other meatball style dinners!

Lightly toasted garlic bread makes big difference.  I also added a bit of sweet Italian sausage. When warming sauce and meatballs in electric covered skillet the meatballs become very tender. Very good and meatballs freeze easily.

4.5 stars.  I don't like meatballs with so much bread crumbs, so I only added 2 T.  And increased the spices by adding onion and garlic powders, red pepper flakes, basil, oregano and some Worcestershire sauce.  Served on individual hoagie buns with mozzarella instead of provolone.  If you put the sandwiches under the broiler to melt the cheese, be mindful that it takes less than a minute to burn the buns.  Don't ask me how I know this.  ;-)

Great meatballs! Wasn’t a fan of the sauce and I will use my own in the future. The meatballs were also made a tad bit too big so an open face meatball sandwich was required. I will be making future meatballs with an inch diameter so it would be easier to eat as well.

Fantastic meatball sandwich. Could not rave enough about it. Feel free to experiment with the seasonings. Each time you'll find a great result.

I didn't make any changes, this was pretty good all by itself. I must say the first night  I cooked it it was not as good as each day of leftovers. They were awesome.

I added one pound pork sausage in addition to the ground beef and then doubled the other ingredients to make 24 meatballs. The pork really added another layer of flavor. I also baked them on a rack (sprayed with olive oil nonstick cooking spray) over a cookie sheet, which drained the grease, and then I blotted them on paper towels when done. I researched several other recipes and found this to be the simplest, and in the end, absolutely fantastic!

It turned out really good and I have never made or had a meatball sub before.  Although I did tweak the recipe to fit the way that I normally make meatballs.

Overall it was good. I thought the meatballs were a little bland. I even followed others suggestions bumping up seasonings, eggs,onion & cheese. I even added a jalapeño.  I will make this again , with a little more tweeking. The 15 meatballs I made cooked perfectly in my toaster oven in 25 min.

I’m always looking for quick and delicious recipes during the week days. This meatball sandwich meets these criterias! It was so good. My husband asked when I was going to make this recipe again! The only thing I changed was the cheese. We don’t care for provolone, we used mozzarella instead.

I will say that I just started cooking recently and this was an easy recipe to make. My wife is an excellent cook and I knew if I won her over, this would be a success. Well, she gave it two thumbs up and most importantly our kids enjoyed it as well (kids can be so picky) so to win them over as well, I felt great! Follow the recipe to a tee and you two will feel great and fulfilled!

The best meatball sandwich we have ever  eaten. Instead of bread crumbs I use pieces of Italian bread soaked in milk.  I have tried several sauces and find we like Paul Newman's Marinara best. When the meatballs are done I simmer them in the sauce for about 30 minutes then store over night in the fridge just because I think  most dishes taste better then next day.  Makes for an easy  make ahead meal Thanks for sharing this keeper recipe.

Substitute a little italian sausage for some of the ground beef.  Added minced onion and extra parmesan cheese.   Just two of us so half was made into meatballs the other half I cooked in frying pan and will use in lasagna. It actually works ! BTW- I wish reviewers would say why they didn't like this recipe, not just "didn't like".

Amazing! I didn’t have Italian seasoning so I subbed dried parsley, oregano and basil. They were perfectly cooked at 20 minutes. I didn’t bother toasting the bread with olive oil, garlic or salt. Will make again and again :)

My husband and I loved it with ground bison. I followed a reviewer’s changes by adding an extra clove of garlic, an extra tbsp of grated parmesan cheese, 2 eggs, and 1 tsp fresh black pepper. Next time I will only toast the bread when I add the provolone cheese on top. I rolled the meatballs into bite size so 35 came out.

My kids (who are super picky eaters) love this recipe! The only item I modified was the garlic-- I used about 3/4 of a teaspoon minced garlic. Other than that, these are super easy to make and cook pretty quick as well.

Made mostly to specs--per other suggestions, used a little more bread crumbs/Parmesan + 2 eggs, a little less parsley b/c that's all I had--and this came out great. Been trying (unsuccessfully) for years to make a good meataball sangwich--glad I finally have a winner. Thanks, all!

Think it was great. Used some of the recommendations to up the salt and pepper to 2 TSP and increased the Italian seasoning to 1 T. Delicious! Also forgot the parsley and didn’t miss it.

I have made these a few times and LOVED them. The first time I did as the direction said and used the ingredients but after that I added a few other ingredients such as lemon pepper, chili powder, and onion powder. I also browned all the sides first before putting it in the oven to cook and it turns out great. This is my go to meatball sub and meatballs for other recipes.

OK cheated just a little.  Meatballs came from Costco and I use subs from the Deli at Kroger's .  Followed the  recipe on how to assemble adding the same spices and EEOV.  Instead of topping  with the other half of the bread I  browned them, assembled with three meat balls per half and top with the Provolone cheese.  Then back into the oven to melt .  Couldn't just stop with one half and downed both.  Excellent.

Made this with the only exception I made my own marinara sauce. It was very good and like to use these meatballs for spaghetti dinners as well

The whole family enjoyed this one. Double batch added 5 garlic cloves and a 3 eggs. Sprinkled fresh basil on top and used mozzarella because it was what I had. Made the meatballs in 1 Tbsp size with a flat edge so they baked quickly and didn't roll off the bread. Made about 50 meatballs but only used about half of them on 3 1/2 14" loaves. Happy to have leftovers!

So good even my husband who doesn't care for meatballs loved these. I doubled the recipe making 24 giant balls. Changes i made for doubled recipe 4 eggs, used italian seasoned crumbs, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsp pepper. I also used 45 oz sauce and browned them quickly with no oil then let them simmer covered on very low heat setting in the sauce for about an hour instead of baking. I used hoagie rolls and didnt do the extra steps for them. These were wonderful. Thank you for sharing your recipe

Enjoyed by parents and kids.  Don't over-toast the bread and add some spices to the sauce; what's good for spaghetti was a bit bland for the bread.

I made it exactly as the recipe said (for the exception of my sandwich...i don't like cheese).  I think the only issue i had (personal issue) was that the meat balls weren't salty enough for me (i LOVE salt...bad i know) which was an easy fix BUT the husband and teen LOVED them, even the man-child 1 year old loved it, so i will definitely be making again.

10.08.16 ~ Whipped up this quick meatball recipe to have a couple for dinner in mini slider buns and to have a few in the freezer for a quick meal. These worked perfectly with nice flavor. I had an open package of sharp cheddar cheese, so I used that rather than provolone. Served this with 'Kicked Up Mac and Cheese' from AR.

I was looking for a meatball recipe and came across this. The only changes I made was that I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and I don't buy Parmesan in a can so it was freshly grated. I also used mozzarella cheese. To make it easier for the kids with keeping it on the bun, I baked in a cupcake pan and smushed it somewhat flat. Was a very delicious recipe. Of course, the sauce you use will determine how this would taste as well. I was very happy and would make again.

Very yummy! Per another's review I made this with 2 eggs instead of 1 and 3 tsp Italian seasoning instead of two. I thought the seasoning was a bit strong, and would probably stick to 2 tsp next time, though.

Really good.  I made it with 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage, 2 eggs and omitted the Italian Seasoning since I thought the sausage was seasoned enough.  I also browned them a bit before baking. Nice and moist.  A keeper.

Delicious! I used garlic salt in the meatballs and took out the garlic powder & salt. I also doubled the Italian seasoning. It could've used more sauce because it made A LOT of meatballs.

These were gereat, my husband loved them! Followed the other reviewers advice to add an additional egg and another tsp of Italian seasoning, we also used hoagie rolls instead of French baguette. We were able to fit 3 meatballs on each hoagie and it made 6 sandwiches

Very tasty as written.  My personal twist is to use chunky pizza sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce (I think it adds more flavor) and when toasting the rolls I like to spread half the bread with garlic butter and the other side of the roll with pesto.  So yummy!

Just made this and it was yummy. The hubby loved it and at his suggestion I will be adding this recipe to the normal rotation. Didn't have parsley so I left that out. I accidentally got mozzarella cheese so used that  and it was fine. Meatballs were served on Italian bread since store didn't have French baguette . Bread ended up being perfect. Highly recommend for quick meal.

If you prefer firmer meatballs, cook it a little longer than is suggested.   We enjoyed it a lot, the flavors are great, but the meatballs were a little bit mushier than we like.

The best meatball recipe ever!  I put the meatballs, raw, in a baking pan, and poured two 24-oz cans of sauce on top.  I covered the pan with foil and baked at 350F for 50 mins.  Tender and scrumptious!  This is now my go-to meatball recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe was good.  The bread is going to differ depending on the way you get it from the store.  I would be more picky about my bread the next time.  The bread I got broke in half too easy.  I would've preferred bread that had some more resilience.  

Overall, I liked the meatballs.  They had some strong flavor of their own and the added garlic powder to the roll was a nice touch to add more flavor.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

I used Turano Rolls (come 6 in a pack)…and 1 26 oz. Ragu Traditional Spaghetti Sauce, and instead of provolone I used an 80z. pkg. of shredded mozzarella cheese.  To die for as far as my family is concerned…for a side…french fries and I purchased some antipasto salad from an Italian Food Market.

Didn't really have much flavor.
One thing I will add to people making this, do not use a cheap sauce; get a tasty garlic one! Also, I think if I made this again I would just use hot dog buns..

This was alright, not great. Probably better with homemade sauce.

Very good! I'm not a fan of meatballs so I don't make them all the time but for some reason, this sandwich was SO good even my picky teen said they were "the best meatballs she's ever had" and she ate the whole sandwich (which is rare!).  French baguette is a very skinny loaf so I just used individual hoagie rolls. And when I put them back in the oven for the cheese to melt, I turned on the broiler and put them in for 2 minutes.  Great sandwich!

As is written I'd only give it 4. I felt like it needed more seasoning and maybe a little thicker sauce, But that depends on the sauce you buy. Next time I'll add more seasoning. Still really good, thanks!

Made this recipe tonight and absolutely loved it! Did add a few personal touches (all beef, extra parmesan, and extra on the seasonings) but all in all it was one of the most D-Lish recipes I have made! Would definitely recommend to others and are planning on making it again and again!

I liked it this recipe. Extremely easy to make. The only problem to me was that there was no wow factor. I'm going to use the recipe again, just going to doctor it up. Definitely the way to go the French baguette though, awesome idea!

Why did it take so long for the meatballs to cook?  They were in my oven for 30 minutes and still had pink.  Oven is totally operational.  The meatballs were ok, but store bought is cheaper and easier.  Also, the salt on the bread was not necessary. We won't repeat this one, but I'm glad others enjoyed it :)

I added some salt to the meatballs. Otherwise the recipe is perfect as is. Definitely toast/oil the bread so the sandwich does not get soggy.

love it!!! I made a few changes though I used two eggs and added about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and a tablespoon of dried parsley and oregano since I didn't have fresh. I also added an extra garlic. It had way more flavor that way I suggest you try my changes my husband loved it.

Used this recipe for meatballs with pasta. Came out alright. Not the best I've ever had but better than other recipes I've tried. Would not make again though, still searching for a better one out there.

This should really be a 4.5 star review, but we can't do that on here :) The recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS. Yummy tasting meat, and I used Prego Meat sauce for my spaghetti sauce. I used an Italian loaf of bread instead of the french baguette. I did pretty much everything to a T, but the reason I rated 4 stars was because the cooking time was off. I would say 30 minutes is right about it if you're cooking it at 350, and I did preheat the oven before hand so I know that it needs longer cooking. I was making this for my husband before he went to work and saw that this would be pretty quick, but it ended up taking a bit longer due to the cook time. Even still, the recipe turned out delicious and it was ready right on time for him to go. I will make this again, but definitely make sure you cook the meatballs for longer.

This was amazing!!!! Meatball subs are one of my favorite foods and this was the best meatball sub I have ever had. I followed other reviewers suggestions and made it on hoagie rolls instead of the baguette. Other than that, the recipe is perfect as is and is definitely worth trying out. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.

Very good. I didn't have baguette bread but did on gourmet dinner rolls. Next time will do on baguette; it does need the sturdier bread. My kids loved loved loved it! Thank you for the recipe. The only suggestion I would make (and its obvious), you might want to add salt and pepper.

Loved it! Doubled the quantities, making 12 proper, half-fist-sized meatballs; baked at 325 for 20 then 350 for 10 minutes; and used a more generous pinch for the seasonings. 

The temp/time alteration was because my pans tend to overcook (nonstick and dark), and the meatballs were huge so I wanted to cook for 30 minutes but did not want them to be overdone. 

Do use the inside of the baguette for breadcrumbs. Just stick the bread pieces in a food processor/magic bullet. What I love most about this recipe is I didn't have to run to the store for anything.

Made this for my son, who loves these at Subway.  He said they were just as good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  My husband and my son's friend loved them, too, as did I.  This will be a weekend favorite at our house now.

DH did not like it - too much Italian seasoning.  My 7 and 3 year old sons liked them.  I thought the seasoning was too much.  I will make them again but half the amount of seasoning.

Really excellent, although it depends a lot on the quality of both the meatballs and the sauce, so make or buy the best you can.

The only change I make to this recipe is that I use ground turkey instead of beef. I must say these are the absolute best meatballs I've ever eaten. Very tasty and moist.

I only made the meatballs to go in spaghetti, so this doesn't have to do with the sandwich part. My husband and I found the meatballs boring and unflavorful. wouldn't make again.

Super bomb sandwhich BIGGUY728! Only thing I would do different would be make maybe four meatballs instead of 12. . .Bigger meatballs would have tottaly made this meatball boat sink in my belly like the titanic. Regardless though this is most def a man aproved sandwhich.

Wow! These were amazing. Just as is, no changes. They held together so well and not a one of them fell apart. Didn't have a baguette so I  used a hoagie roll. it's a meatball sandwich, no need to get all fancy lol.

These were delicious!  I did make simple changes that other reviewers recommended like a little more garlic, Parmesan, and Italian seasoning but I think it would good either way.  We had the leftovers with spaghetti and my picky 4 yr old who usually doesn't even try dinner gobbled them up and asked for more!  Definitely a keeper.

I've never even eaten a meatball sandwich before, let alone make one.  But it was my husband's birthday and he loves meatballs, so I attempted this recipe.  It was easy to follow and super delicious! I am definitely going to make this more often.  This seems like a great recipe for game days or just dreary cold winter evenings.

I wish I could give this recipe 100 stars, it is SO delicious.  I made it exact as the recipe called, the meatballs are SO good I have decided to make a triple batch and freeze them to have them on hand for spaghetti in the future.  It's such great comfort food, very simple and not too time-consuming! Thanks for the recipe, will make over and over again!

This recipe is awesome!  My boyfriend was craving a meatball sandwich and came across this recipe one day.  The only thing different is he likes white American cheese and we used wheat baguettes.  Also, for the dried Italian seasoning we just used Italian dressing.  I highly recommend these meatball sandwiches.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! My Boyfriend and I love this recipe. I have made this a few times. I baked the meatballs for about 30mins then transferred meatballs and sauce into crockpot. When ready to serve toasted hoagie rolls in oven then added the meatballs and melt with  shredded mozzarella/provolone cheese blend under the broiler.  BEST meatball Sandwiches I have ever tasted!

Very good sandwich.  Very quick and easy.  Love the flavor from baking them instead of frying them in grease.  Next time will try baking them in the sauce and covering with aluminum foil.  I'm using the leftover meatballs on spaghetti tonight.  Thanks for a great meatball recipe!

I have to give this recipe one star, I'm sorry to say.  The meatballs were a little on the dry side and fairly tasteless (which amazed me because I really anticipated all that wonderful garlic in the mixture).  There wasn't quite enough sauce, and the bread overpowered the meat.  My Superbowl guests ended up eating some of the meatballs with a fork and even then, most of it was discarded.  One star for presentation, however.

I've never made meatball sandwiches before, but after making this recipe, I will be making them again! Very simple and tasty! The only thing I will change next time, is cooking the meatballs an additional 5 minutes.

I never tried meatball sandwich before and when I did this recipe I loved it. The meatballs are so tasteful that my whole family enjoys everytime I make them. I use the same recipe of the meatballs to my spagetti and it taste great!.

This was quite good. I used mozzarella rather than provolone because that is what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My 2 year old loved the meatballs! And I had plenty for to freeze for another meal.

These are wonderful!!! I've finally found the perfect meatball recipe. They were very moist even though it didn't look like they would be. I did however end up making 26 meatballs instead of 12, so if you're going to stick with 12, I'd suggest cooking a little longer.

Great flavor and consistency. However, my meatballs took nearly twice as long to bake than the recommended 15 to 20 minutes.

Best meatball recipe ever.....I tripled it and used alittle more garlicm I also used italian breadcrumbs in place of plain.  For the sauce I used my own recipe and did not use french baquettes but instead used hogie rolls.

I loved this but now that I'm looking back at the recipe I realized I changed it a lot!! I made garlic bread with sourdough rolls and used different cheese and seasonings in the meathballs. Amazing!

These were good but a little mushy. I used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs, but that should not have made a difference.  These were just ok.

Delicious sandwich! I love the idea of baking them! I usually fry them which is annoying. Baking was way easier!! I baked them for almost 30 minutes which was perfect. Very moist. Thanks!

I thought the Italian seasoning was overpowering but, other than that, the meatballs had no flavor. I had to use an extra egg too. I'll keep looking but thank you for sharing your recipe!

Love these meatballs! I'll be using this regularly in my meal planning. Boyfriend and son really liked the meatball subs. Only thing, next time I'll try making my own sauce vs. store-bought. Thanks for sharing.

I have been using this recipe for 2-3 years now for all meatball cooking. It's great with spaghetti, for Swedish meatballs, spicy meatballs, etc... They cook well either baked or in the frying pan. Any other recipe I do that has meatballs as part of the recipe, I skip and use this one instead. Funnily enough, I've never actually made a meatball sandwich :)

Goodness this is great!  I made this for my husband and three small kids. I followed the directions as is. It was so yummy. I will be making these again. So much flavor.  My husband could not stop eating these meatballs. 2 sandwiches for dinner and one for a snack.  Next time I made double the recipe.

I have to first say that I am not a fan of meatball subs. After eating this, I am! This recipe is wonderful!. I am going to use this for my regular meatballs from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

We found these meatballs to be rather bland.  I used very lean ground meat (93/7), maybe that made a difference???  I followed the recipe precisely.  Nothing special.

So Yummy!!! I made this last night for my dad and I-followed the recipe for the meatballs, but we used just a regular french bread loaf without toasting it, and added mozzarella in place of provolone. Perfect! Dad even complemented how good it was-he even got a second helping of just the meatballs.

I served it on loaves of garlic bread and it just upped the flavour to a new level. Delicious and quick!

I have made these several times and always turns out fabulous.  Made them the last time for my bf and his kids.  They absolutely loved them.  For hungry company, I recommened making 3-4 times the recipe.  I doubled; had enough but they all wanted more.  I'm going to make the meatballs and put them in a freezer for a quick meal when needed.  The meatballs are great!!  Made exactly as recipe states.

I was looking for something different and this is now a family favorite. My family loved it. I added pepperoni to the sauce for extra favor.  It does make alot so I cut up the remainder balls and made spagetti the next day.

I made the meatballs and they came out great. They were a little mushy so I broiled them about 2 minutes a side. Much better.

I have never made meatballs before,but after reading the reviews, gave this recipe a try. I took some of the suggestions, added Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the plain, and added extra parm cheese.  I made the meatballs smaller and cooked them for 15 minutes.  They turned out great! My son and husband loved them.  The only change next time would be to make more sauce for dipping.

Best meatballs i ever made or tasted and me and my family always make meatballs when we have picnics or parties. I followed the recipe but needed to triple for a birthday party. The only thing i added to it was about 1tbsp of worsteshire sause. Usually my meatballs tend to fall apart but not these maybe because they were baked instead of pan seared. After they baked for 25 minuted i put them into the crockpot to keep them warm with 2 jars of garlic tomatoe sauce and served with buns.  Delicious!! My new permanent meatball recipe.

I thought it was boring! I followed this recipe correctly but I didn't care for it. My boyfriend liked it but I just wasn't satisfied. Next time I'm gonna add more to the meatballs such as cubed cheddar cheese stuffed into the center! We'll see I'll have to do some tweaking to get this where I want it to be...but the recipe is a good starting point...

Really good the whole family enjoyed it! I give it five stars with my one addition, I chopped up about 1/4 of an onion.  The onion made gave it a lot of flavor, I think next time I will add some oregano too.

This is a great recipe, and so much easier than the meatballs I traditionally make.  No pre-frying, just bake and you're set!  So good that my husband came home for lunch so that I could warm them up special for him (just not the same in the microwave, I guess!)  I thought they were a little dense, though, but I added 2 eggs so that might be my fault.

I used this recipe to make spaghetti and meatballs. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I was nervous about only baking it for 20 min, so I left them in the oven for 25. Will probably up that to 30 min next time.

A meatball sandwich is going to be pretty decent no matter what, in my opinion. This recipe obviously depends greatly on the pasta sauce you use (mine was an olive and tomato one I love, check), and the meatballs, which are pretty average and bland as written. Still, we enjoyed these sandwiches very much after a little doctoring to our tastes. Thanks!

This was pretty good, but the consistency of the meatballs was a little soft...  I would use less breadcrumbs in the future.

AWESOME!!!!  The flavor was amazing.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I used italian flavored bread crumbs and 2 eggs.  I also used garlic powder instead of taking the time to mince garlic cloves.  FYI 1 garlic clove = 1/8 tsp garlic powder.  I also added more parmesan cheese.  My boyfriend loved it!  I will only use this recipe from now on!

I never thought of myself as one who liked meatballs, but that is because I never had ones taste like these! I followed recipe to a "T" and they were so yummy I ate them with just sauce. I plan on having them on a roll for lunch tomorrow, and I am sure they will taste even better after sitting in sauce all night. Thank you for this easy recipe, it is a keeper!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  However, because of some of the other reviews, I decided to use Italian style bread crumbs and then only added a bit more Italian seasoning to the beef mixture. I also used hoagie rolls instead of a French baguette. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this for a party, so I doubled the recipe.  I substitued a pound of ground hot italian sausage for the ground beef.  It was delicious.  Also, I put the meat balls in the frige overnight and then placed them in the slow cooker an hour before the party, covered them with sauce and warmed them up.  Everyone loved them.

i would probably really say 4 1/2 stars.  it didn't have as much flavor as i was hoping for, but with the sauce and provelone, these were really really delicious.  i used about half as much breadcrumbs.  and i didnt read the directions, so i added everything into the meat except the sauce, provelone, and bread.  instead of garlic powder i added onion powder.  and they were delicious!  even made them the wrong way!

These were a little bland for us. After mixting it up I fried up a little bit to test for seasoning.  We thought it needed more flavor so we added a little more garlic, parsley and parm.  Also used about a 1/2 of an onion minced.  As well as a little oregano.   So, good but we like a alot of flavor.

I have made these meatballs many, many times to use on spaghetti - my son is the PICKIEST eater and would not eat anything made with beef until I made these.  They are delicious!!!  If you don't have the breadcrumbs, I've found 20 saltines crushed works just as well.  I also add a little salt and sometimes mozzarella cheese.  You can make these smaller to go on spaghetti - I usually make about 24, bake for 10 minutes, turn over and bake another 10-15.  Fabulous recipe!

This recipe was yummy. I think next time we will add more parmesan. We had to keep the meatballs in longer than the time on the recipe. We also made 24 meat balls instead of 12 because the size seemed more reasonable. I think we will try it with sausage next time to add more of a kick. Thankyou for the recipe :D

I used this for the meatballs!  They are fantastic!  Make a bunch a head of time, stick them in the freezer for later use, either sandwich or spaghetti! Excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

Really good and easy to make! Followed the exact recipe and came out delicious.  I had to cook mine for 30 minutes...perhaps the size of the meatballs vary.  Everyone loved it!

Very Good!!! I did make my own sauce so I could add the ingredients I wanted. I also cooked for 30 minutes, but I had a little more than one pound of meat. I also used very lean meat. Everyone loved them!

I made these last night and they are delicious!  My husband loved them.  I am giving them a 4 and not a 5 because I did have to alter the recipe as written.  As suggested by previous reviewers, I used two eggs instead of one.  I added a tsp of salt and increased the Italian seasoning (which I mixed myself, using a recipe on this site) and garlic.  I didnt have fresh parsley so I used dried. I didnt use the French baguette part of the recipe so I can't comment on that.  I used fresh bakery baked hoagie rolls and Barilla brand jarred Marinara sauce.  Also, we used ground sirloin since someone said to use the leanest beef possible and I am glad we did.  The meatballs cooked up just fine at 350 degrees for 20 minutes exactly.  It met and exceeded my craving for a meatball sub and I could control the fat and ingredients!  Reheating them was a breeze too.  Just microwaved a few meatballs and a small glass bowl of marinara on the reheat serving and stuck in the bun - delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was my first time making meatballs and they came out great. I also made homemade sauce with it instead of a jar. Like the other suggested I used 2 eggs and 1TBSP of Italian seasonings. Will definitely make again!

This is basically the same recipe I use for my meatballs.  The only exception is that I add a medium sized shallot, minced, and a couple of slices of white bread soaked in milk (along with the Italian bread crumbs). This seems to make the texture better without them falling apart. Plus I also don't use quite as much Italian seasoning and add a little dried oregano (even though there's some in the seasoning).   Delicious.  kathy13

These meatballs are great!  I have never baked meatballs before, and I am not sure if it is necessary, or if you could just cook them stovetop.  I'll try that next time.  You definately need to cook them more than 5 minutes though to cook them through!  Anyway, it was a great recipe; the provolone is nice and melty.  I used the leftover meatballs for spaghetti and meatballs.

This meatball sandwich had promise, but the dried Italian seasoning came across way too strong.  Will tone it down next time, but still a good sandwich.

Excellent.  I made these and they turned out just right.  I made spicy tomato sauce, so that added a lot of extra flavor.  I used Italian bread crumbs and I salted the meat, so I didn't think they lacked flavor.  I will totally make these again.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Meatballs need to be cooked way longer. Probably 35-40 minutes. Cut fr. bread in half and used 4 meatballs. 3 meatballs would suffice. Used Mom's spaghetti sauce and Italian Blend Cheese. Just make pesto turkey meatballs w Mona spaghetti sauce. Don't make these meatballs. Throwdown: Meatballs

I am so glad I went with the baguette instead of hoagie rolls on this. The roared garlic bread is a great touch.  Actually, I used batard. The baguettes at my store were really skinny.  I used the. Worlds best Marinara recipe instead of jarred sauce.  Why ruin a great recipe with Ragu?  Very nice!

my boyfriend and i LOVED these! this made a lot of meatballs for me as well. i used a little more garlic, a couple dashes of black pepper, mozzarella instead of provolone, and i skipped the garlic powder and salt on the bread - didn't really need it.

Very good recipe. I used co-jack cheese instead of the provolone because I had it on hand. It took more than 5 minutes prep as is written, but it was good and simple to prepare. Its a winner.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I had a couple of slight changes, due to not having a couple of items,(I had to use garlic powder as I was out of minced, no fresh parsley, so I had to used dried) but all in all, still very good.  I did add a little ground turkey to the mixture and I made smaller meatballs.  I cooked them in my mini muffin tin to help maintain their shape. The recipe was easy to prepare, it was quick to make, and ultimately, it was delicious.  Will become a regular in my house!  Thanks for sharing!

delicious.  served this to a group of women for lunch...  terrific.  i did an unhealthy thing and fried the meatballs like my Roman great grandmother taught.  surprised that i didn't miss the lack of onion in this recipe.  i feel liberated from the teary chop chop!

This was ok.  I used turkey meat instead, but there just weren't enough spices in this - needs more zing.

delicious!! I changed only two things-i used regular marble cheese slices as my choice of topping cheese and used a 9" sub-bun.  mm mm good.  My husband says it tasted just like the subway meatball sub. Enjoy!

Very good meatball recipe. Since I prefer beef meatballs over the beef/lamb/pork mix, this worked our great.  I had all the ingredients on hand which made it just that much easier.  Thanks for a great change in our weekly dinner rotation!

This is an awesome recipe for making meatballs! I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I just used basil, oregano, and dried onion. I used Prego sauce and added to it about 1/4 cup of leftover homemade sauce, and I added sauteed onion, garlic, and spices to the sauce and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I also used regular hoagie rolls instead of French bread. Tastewise, everything was great. Preparation was a disaster, however. It took over 45 minutes for the meatballs to cook, and I had to crank up the oven to 400. I have never heard of not browning meatballs on the stove, and if I make these sandwiches in the future, I will be cooking them on the stove. There also was barely enough sauce--if I hadn't have added extra sauce, there might not have been any left to cover the meatballs (we love sauce). I highly recommend using a larger jar of sauce than the recipe specifies. Maybe with these changes this will be easier to prepare. Thanks.

This was very good.  I made it without parmesan cheese and used veggie shreds on top (due to a milk allergy in the house)and it tasted great.

Perfection!!  I served these cut in half on thick slices of "Tasty White Bread" (recipe in the bread section of this site), just like a favorite neighborhood restaurant here serves meatball sandwiches.  I did make one substitution based on the personal tastes of my family; I subbed seasoned cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

mixture for pasta. The meatballs were
GREAT. Obviously I made smaller meatballs
and froze the rest. Thanks for Sharing

I made the meatballs smaller ( about 24 ) and will make them even smaller next time. We used left over toasted hot dog buns and the guys handled them easily. I do think the meatballs lack something...next time I will add very finely diced onion to the ground beef.

I have made these meatballs a number of times now just for the meatballs and excluded the sandwich part. I cut down on the amount of parmesan cheese because my boyfriend is lactose intolerant and they still taste great! I would encourage people to play with the seasonings too, adding things you like or just whatever you have in your cupboard. These are simple and fantastic.

I was looking for a way to make and freeze meatballs for later use, and this recipe was perfect.  I used the ingredients as stated, but stopped short of the red sauce step.  Instead, after baking the meatballs, I let them cool and then put them in a freezer bag.  I took them out later in the week for spaghetti and meatballs and got compliments all around - this is a keeper!

This was really good.  I made it exactly the way the recipe stated.  However, the meatballs took much longer to cook than the recipe stated so I would suggest checking them and possibly planning on a longer cooking time.

This was a great sandwich. Definitely a keeper.  I made a few changes, using turkey and using my own bread topped with Italian seasoning and garlic.  It was yummy.  Even my 13month old baby couldn't stop eating the meatballs.

This recipe was fast and easy, but my family of 7 did NOT care for the taste of the meatball.  I prefer hoagie buns, in other recipes, and mozzarella instead of provolone.

Pretty good... very filling! My boyfriend liked it more than I did, but then again, he likes meatballs quite a bit more than I do. :) I do think that next time I would cut the garlic down to one clove. I topped with shredded mozzarella instead of provolone, since that's what I had on hand. Thanks :)

My picky ex-cook boyfriend loves these meatballs.  I made it with 4%fat ground beef and no parsley.  I made smaller meatballs like others suggested.  I used Trader Joe's organic no-salt marinara.  A really great healthy but decadent sandwich.  Also, the leftovers were great with pasta.

I'm convinced that if you have the time, you can find the best recipes by the best cooks at AllRecipes.  You/we aren't chefs, we're just the best of the best cooks. This recipe for meatballs is superior to anything I found on the "Professional Chef's" site which will remain nameless!
Thank you for shareing.

Sorry we did not like this meatball recipe.  I think it did need an extra egg, and less seasoning and breadcrumbs.   They were very dry and hard.  I really do not think you taste the meat in these meatballs, really just a lot of filler and seasonings.

These meatballs are the best and really easy to make.  We make them a little smaller than the recipe so they are easier to eat in a sandwich.

These sandwiches are great.  The recipe was simple and the taste is awesome.  I think next time I may place meatballs on halved pre-made dinner rolls and serve as appetizers.  Great, great, great.

really excellent meatball recipe.  i used 1 lb ground turkey, and my hubby didn't even know it wasn't beef!  I used extra tomato sauce since I like to dip the sandwich.  My batch also was about 24 meatballs.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made 24 meatballs out of this recipe, so I boiled some spaghetti and served that for dinner, with meatball subs as leftovers the next day.

Best meatballs on allrecipes.

I made the meatballs following the recipe exactly. I was looking for a quick dinner using lean ground beef and this was it! I simmered premade sauce from a jar and added the meatballs till coated after they cooked. I spooned this over spaghetti. Delicious and filling!

Okay this is really simple to make! I had almost all the Indge. and well I forgot to get the Italian Seasoning and the PROVALONE!... Well Hubby said they were pretty darn good!  Soo even w/out the BEST PART! the CHeeeeeese they were yummy! My kids loved them too! I also instead of baking all the MB's on a baking dish I whipped out my 12ct/muffin/cupcake pan! and that worked our really great! the cooked in not time! You could actually make probably smaller MB"s because they were huge I had to cut them in 1/2!  I will make these again and nextime  NOT forgetting the Provalone/or maybe trying MOzzarella!

I really liked this and my kids did too. I thought I would need more so I made a recipe and a half, but it really was enough for our family. I did however use more spagetti sauce since the kids liked it saucey. We all decided next time to make the meatballs smaller for their smaller mouths.

WOW!! My family and I loved this. I loved that it was simple and quick to prepare. I did not have any bread crumbs so I crushed French's French Fried onions :) I also added tomato soup to the spag sauce. Wondering how it holds up in the crock pot?? I see some are stating about the meat being greasy, I purchase from the butcher and there was NO grease, not sure what kind of hamburger it is.
THANKS
Donna

I love these meatballs.  It's the first meatball I ever made that held it's shape.  They are full of flavor and I use them for sandwich's and in spaghetti dishes.  Only thing I change is how big I make them.  These are huge meatballs per the receipe.  I make them smaller.

Thanks

Meatballs were excellent. The only changes I made were adding a bit of salt and pepper to the meatball mixture and I used a softer roll. Delicious!

This was good. I followed recipe without any changes. Made the meatballs subs for me and the hubby and angel hair pasta with the meatballs for our small children. My 3 yr old begged for some of mine and loved it! Next time I will seriously cut back on the italian seasoning. Hubby said it was fine but it was way too much for me. Will make again but might play around with ingredients for the meatballs. Meatball subs were a nice change of pace and easy to alter to toddler friendly.

This was really good!  I didn't have italian seasoning, so I used italian bread crumbs.  I also added an extra garlic clove, oregano, black pepper, salt, and garlic powder to the meat mix.

I'm not a big meatball fan, but I thought these were pretty good.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I ground some instant oatmeal instead - this keeps the meatballs moist too.  I loved the cheese in the recipe as well.  I got 20 meatballs out of this.  I didn't make a meatball sub with them, but used them in sauce for spaghetti, and made awesome garlic toast w/ Italian Bread Using a Bread Machine from Destiny.  What a great meal!

I've used this meatball recipe several times only not as a sandwich.  They go perfect with your own homemade or store bought sauce and what ever type of pasta you desire.

This was wonderful!!  I added salt to the meatballs and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also didn't have parsley so I nixed that, added chopped mushrooms and chopped onions. I used them for spaghetti and they were delicious!

This is a very good recipe.  Next time though I will add more salt.  I also used 2 lb of hamburger and 2 eggs.  I will also add more parmesan cheese to the meatball mixture.

This Recipe is very good. I am a total beginner and easily made it. However I do have a few suggestions. First Make the meatballs so as to fit about 2-3 in a hot dog bunn. Also, for the garlic you can easily substitute garlic powder. Taste Great!!! Good Recipe

These were great!!!  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It will be a family favorite from now on!!  YUM!  

I made the meatballs by using a large scoop and just scooping the meatballs into a mini-muffin tin.  It was easy and aside from having to stick your hands into the meat to mix it up (which I have to admit really is the best way to get it all together in this case)it relieves a lot of the meat-touching moments. I'm a little whimpy when it comes to handling raw meat. :) BUT IT'S SO WORTH IT WHEN THIS RECIPE IS THE END PRODUCT!

This was fantastic. I made it with hoagy buns, but still followed the directions for the bread. The meatballs were really great with the extra mushroom spaghetti sauce that I placed the meatballs in. I will be making this again!

These were very good! Made meatballs as directed (next time will use leaner!). Instead of baguette, used softer sub rolls. Fresh mozzarella made these terrific!

Fantastic.  I doubled the recipe for a football party.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs, and also just bought regular sandwich rolls from the bakery section of the supermarket.  Everyone loved these.

These were so awesome.  I used 96% lean ground beef and they were still awesome.  I also used a meat thermometer to make sure I didn't over-cook.  Everyone was impressed!

Really, Really great, my husband loved it...although I used a French loaf instead of a baguette, the baguette was just too hard, we liked the softer bread.

This was very good but I didn't have parmeasan cheese so I left it out. Maybe it would have been 5 stars if I had that.

I doubled the recipe for these and my husband has eaten the leftovers for 3 days straight!  The only problem I found is that with doubling the recipe, I made larger meatballs and they did not cook through within 20 minutes.  I had to keep returning them to the oven, but when they were finally done they were great!  I especially like the added touch of toasting and seasoning the buns..don't skip this part as it is well worth it for your delicious meatballs to be on a hot, toasty bun!

My kids loved this , but next time I make will try a few suggestions about adding some "zing" to the flavor. A great starting point...will make again and tweak a bit. I like the crock-pot suggestion.

I found the meatballs to be a little bland.  Based on the ingredients, I thought the meatballs would have more of a zing, more of an Italian flavor.  Next time I will try adding more or different spices to the meat mix.  Overall though a good recipie, very yummy.

This didn't do anything for me.  The meatball itself was bland (even after adding salt, which the recipe didn't call for) and very disapointing, although I did like the olive oil and garlic salt toasted into the bread itself.  Would not make again.

My husband and I loved!  It will definitely become one of our favorite meals.  I used french bread instead of the baquette.  We thought it was better than one of our favorite restaurants meatball sandwiches!  Paired with a good red wine......Excellent!

very good meatballs, but they need to be cooked longer than this.  Also, a less dense bread is better.

Easy to make and everyone loved it.  Very tasty.  Ended up with too many meatballs but they will keep for another meal.  Next time can just put them in some buns and they will be ready to go.

To be fair, I'm only rating the idea of this recipe because I have my own way of making meatballs and this isn't it. On our last evening of our vacation, I put out a spread of all the leftovers and wanted to do something different with the meatballs I had. The kids loved the melted provolone on their sandwiches and used the sauce to dip. Thanks!

This was excellent. I wanted to make something different with ground beef because I was tired of hamburgers, tacos, etc. This was very easy and tasty! I used shredded italian blend instead of slived provolone and dried basil, oregano, and parsley istead of italian seasoning. Everything else I followed to a T.

These are fantastic!  Even better: they're easy to make!  Mine took 30 minutes to bake (rather than the recipe's 20 min), but I probably made the meatballs a little bigger than normal.  My husband is in love with this dish.

These meatballs were fantastic! I doubled the recipe and used the leftovers for spaghetti and meatballs the next night. I made the meatballs earlier in the morning and baked them later in the day. I also made my own sauce. We didn't toast the bread because of time, but this is definitely a recipe to keep!

Very Good.  I did not need an entire jar of sauce and I did have to cook them a little longer.  I used 1 lb and it made 13 nice meatballs.  They turned out very flavorful and very moist.  Will deffinitely make again!! Thanks.

I made this as ziti and meatballs and let me tell you - the meatballs are fantastic!  It was my first attempt and they were moist and tasty.  However, I used ground turkey and I also sauted some onion and added it to the meatball mix. I will make meatball sandwiches from the leftovers!

DELICIOUS!  I made these last night for dinner and I'm snacking on the leftovers right now. :)  I followed the recipe to a tee (including times/temps) except I left out the parsley, added some salt, pepper, and onion seasoning, and used freshly grated parm (probably about a 1/4 cup).  I used mozzarella instead of provolone because that's what I prefer.  Will definitely be making these again in the NEAR future.  (I used whole-wheat hoagie rolls which were awesome)

The best recipe on this website!  We all loved it.  I added a half pound hot sausage to make it go a little further because we had unexpected company. It was great!(Took me longer than 5 minutes to prepare, though.) Will try with spaghetti next time instead of the bread.  Yummy!

This was a great weeknight recipe! I just searched for recipes with ground beef, and came up with this recipe. I used soft french rolls and they were perfect. Be sure you remove the bread to make a well. You'll need it! My husband and I will definitely have this again.

This recipe is so easy and good!  I've made it several times for my family and friends - we've all loved it!  I also have made the meatballs separate a few times and served w/noodles.  It's great!

I make a heap of these meatballs (usually 16-18) then keep them at work with some cheese and hoagie rolls.  It's easy to put together at work and is delicious.

Excellent!  My husband and daughter loved these sandwiches.  The meatballs were very good and very easy.
