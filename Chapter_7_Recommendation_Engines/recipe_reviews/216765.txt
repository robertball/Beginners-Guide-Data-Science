This chicken was fantastic, the only change I made was to season the chicken breasts with garlic and salt & pepper prior to browning.  The sauce was a perfect blend of flavors, the balsamic did not overpower the balckberry as I thought it might.  I can't wait to make this one again.

1 star for flavor, there just wasn't enough for me.  I tasted much more thyme than berry, and the sauce was very bland.  However, i did use a no-sugar fruit spread and that could have played a big part.  If you're planning on trying this recipe, be sure not to make that mistake.  I had leftover chicken, but invented my own sauce the next day and was much more pleased......here's what i came up with:  1 TB balsamic vinegar, 2 TB ketchup, 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1/2 cup no-sugar berry spread, 1 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste, 1/4 water + 1/2 TB cornstarch.  As you can see, this is really not true at all to the original recipe.

Followed exact recipe.  It was ok, but I probably won't make it again.  The blackberry fruit spread was the dominate flavor and I'm not sure I like that flavor paired with thyme.  On a plus side, it was very easy to make.

Very easy and quick. I loved the subtle, sweet herb flavor. The chicken breast was very tender and cooked just right. The sauce (more of a glaze, actually) added a nice depth and looked great drizzled on the chicken. I used 1 tsp of dried lemon thyme in place of fresh, but followed everything else exactly. I didn't need the cornstarch, as I thought the sauce reduced quite nicely. A wonderful blend of flavors, which went very well with a nice salad and herbed potatoes!

I am a beginner cook, and found this recipe extremely easy and delicious.  I served the chicken on top of rice, with the sauce poured over it.  My entire family loved it.

Very good and a perfect weeknight option - it wasn't as complex as I would have liked, but that was more than compensated for by how fast and easy it was to make.

This was a great new dish! I was looking for a new chicken recipe and found this. I scaled back on the thyme a tad and ended up making more of the blackberry sauce and let it thicken a bit longer after cooking the chicken. I will definitely make this again!

I had a surplus of seedless blackberry jam in the freezer, and using that this turned out great!

This was pretty good, as well as fast and not having too many ingredients.  I used 1 tsp dried thyme in place of fresh.

With some minor changes (that's just me) I LOVED IT!
