3.22.16   They baked perfectly at 18 minutes, were plenty moist and light, but the "sponge-cake" texture wasn't quite what I was hoping for, although they were very good muffins.  I did use TruviaÂ® Baking Blend instead of sugar so, perhaps, that affected the muffin texture.   I could taste the coconut a lot more than the chocolate flavor and would consider adding some chocolate chips to the batter if I make this again.  Sprinkling some chips on the top did give nice  presentation.  Cheerios, thanks for sharing your recipe.

Substituted steel-cut oats for faster-cooking ones, and left out coconut. They were chewier than expected but not bad.
