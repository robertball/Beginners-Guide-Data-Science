Make these cookies and took them to work as a test not telling anyone that they were sugarfree.
They were a hit with everyone.

Excellent recipe. I used 2 tablespoons of maple syrup instead of fructose syrup. Also added more raisins...a generous 1/2 cup, 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and cloves. Definatly will make again!

I have tried a number of *sugar free* cookie recipes, and this by far is the best.  I followed the recipe as is, but after the first batch came out of the oven, decided to flatten out the dough before baking, this made them more cookie than cake looking.  Next time I will add another tablespoon or two of fructose, but other than that wouldn't change a thing.

I was looking forward to these as a healthy snack, but the recipe as-is was more cake-like than cookie-like.  I added more oats than were called for and added nutmeg and allspice, as well as extra cinnamon.  I'll make them again but I would suggest using more sweetner. . . I like that they retain their moisture for a long time.  Thanks, applesauce!

Made these last night, offered them to the Super Bowl crowd who ate every last one. They raved about my "oatmeal apple cookies".

Just finished baking another batch in which I added some nutmeg and will surely be considering this to be one of my best cookie recipe.

These cookies tasted kind of like sponges so I made some icing using two tablespoons of sugar substitute, a teaspoon of almond extract, 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, and enough skim milk to get it to a drizzley consistency. The icing really helped pep them up.

I found these cookies too doughy and the flavor of apple overpowering. I will not be making them again.

Tested one while I was baking them and discovered that they are not sweet at all, so I made some icing as suggested to brush on top of them.  That helped quite a bit in terms of favor.  I've never made "special diet" treats before, so I'm not sure if there might be a better recipe out there.

Wow, surprisingly tasty despite the lack of sugar. They are almost like little cakes - soft and spongy. Made them for my diabetic aunt, but I will make this again for myself and my 3-year old.

I made these for my Mother-in-law. Neither of us were very impressed. We agreed that if we were starving we'd eat them but otherwise NO.
