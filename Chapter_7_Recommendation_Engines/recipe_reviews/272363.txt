Thank you for a very tasty & super easy dish.  As I always do with all recipes, I slightly altered it to my personal taste. Didn't have foil so used my cast iron pan.  

Added the  same amount of vegetables suggested just for one lamb chop. Left out the butter and cheese. Didn't take very long to cook. Served it over fresh sliced tomatoes.

Cooked a 2nd pan of similar veggies in the leftover pan juices for my 2nd dinner. Equally delicious.
