I thought this was great as did my boys. Instead of ketchup, I used 8 oz. of organic tomato sauce and I added a little Liquid Smoke and two teaspoons of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning (minus the salt). Every bit of this was inhaled. I ate mine without the croutons with a lot of lettuce and I served this with Roasted New Potatoes for my three men. I found that just a little of this cheeseburger filling was plenty filling for me as a salad and everyone enjoyed it. I'll make this again.

YUM. This is fantastic! So simple and a great new way to eat a cheeseburger. I used onion powder instead of real onion and subbed some mustard powder for prepared mustard. The key to this is not letting the beef cool you want the beef hot from the skillet. The hot meat and the fresh crisp cold lettuce was just like eating handheld burger.  Great combo! I topped this with some homemade thousand island dressing. Wonderful recipe. Thanks!

Wow, this was really good and really easy for lunch!  I had a leftover grilled hamburger and a sesame seed roll. Well, instead of having a regular hamburger I turned it into this! Making the hamburger roll into croutons is a great idea.  This really was like eating a cheeseburger but as a salad!

I made as written and it was way too ketchup-y for my taste but that is an easy fix if I were to make it again. I wasn't crazy about the finished dish to be honest but there really wasn't any specifics as to why so it must just be my taste buds. It is exactly as advertised and my hubby liked it so I refuse to give it less than 4 stars.

Tasted just like a cheeseburger! I followed the recipe exactly...only substituting ground turkey for the ground beef. It was a little ketchupie for me if I make it again I will play with the sauce part of the recipe...might also add some bacon and avocado.

Made this for dinner tonight. I used about a hamburger patty sized portion of hamburger for each of our servings (didn't use a pound) and only enough lettuce to cover the plate. It was absolutely delicious. I put my hamburger buns in for seven minutes and they were lightly toasted. 10-12 minutes might have been too much for our oven. Tastes like a genuine cheeseburger, but a more dressed up version that feels more like a meal instead of a sandwich. We'll make this over and over again!

I definitely is just like eating a cheeseburger! Really good! I made it as is, without the onion. Might try a little hot sauce next time just to spice things up!

I love this recipe. Last year I had it for the first time at my Pampered Chef party.  Later I fixed it for my family and they loved it too.  A must try! It also looks pretty on a plate, see my photo:)  I only changed one thing, I used turkey instead of hamburger and it tasted great!

This was really tasty. I used ground turkey breast, a little less ketchup and added some diced up sauted mushrooms. The only part I didn't care for was the bun in the salad. It got too soggy when mixed up with the meat... maybe real croutons would work better. Might try those next time.  I'll make this again

So good! It tastes just like a Big Mac if you add thousand island dressing. I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and extra dill pickles to the meat. Yum

Quick and Easy!  Ready in 20 minutes or less!  I was so bummed that I didn't have any pickles in the house for this.  I'll make this again for sure when I do!

Fantastic!  Don't be afraid to try this one.  Substantial for main meal.  I put a little garlic bread sprinkle on the hamburger buns before cooking and they were really good.  Fast, easy and really good!

I love how easy this is!  I put it together in 15 minutes or so when I wasn't sure what to do with my hamburger I thawed.  You could play around with the flavor of your favorite hamburger.  The ketchup and mustard are more of a sloppy joe flavor, so if you tried more salty seasonings and different sauces, you could make it any way you like.  I did this buffet style so I could refrigerate leftovers, otherwise the lettuce gets yucky if mixed in with the hamburger.  Loved this!!

Not too bad.  Better than expected.  Used white onions.  Must say I think Iceberg lettuce would be best.  It doesn't specify but I used Romaine, which I usually prefer but not in this recipe.

Well this is just delightful!  Lots of tangy flavor and so simple.  It only took me about 20 minutes total.  I didn't use 8 cups of lettuce.  We just all put as much as we wanted in a bowl and topped with the burger mix.  We got 4 servings, not 6.  Yum!

My husband loved it. I also liked it. I didn't use the "croutons". I did use  about 1/3 c. ketchup, the mustard,  half of a sweet onion , about one tablespoon of dill pickle relish. Once the meat and onions were done I mixed it all together. Put everything together and yum.

This was wonderful! The pickles made this salad. I did use half spinach mixed with iceberg just for some nutrients. After reading the reviews, cut the ketchup way down(didn't want it to taste like sloppy joe). I also melted Kraft Deluxe American over the meat in the skillet before spooning it over the chilled salad. Next time, I'm adding bacon and avocado. Thanks for posting this!

This was really tasty and quick to put together!  I cooked a chopped white onion with the ground beef instead of using the red onion, since that's what I had in the fridge and we don't like raw onion.  The hamburger bun idea was clever - next time I will try adding some garlic powder to them per other's suggestions.  We'll be having this again!

This was O.K. but I thought it tasted more like sloppy joes than a cheeseburger.  I guess it just wasn't for me.

What a great salad! I wanted a cheeseburger but I didn't want the greasy, too-full feeling afterward. This salad worked like a charm! I added mayonnaise to the meat because that's how I like my burgers. The pickles made the difference between a hamburger helper taste and a real burger taste. Such a fun salad!

I added 2T of pickle juice to the meat mixture, and saved the chopped pickles for the lettuce mixture.  I also added some of the cheese to the meat mixture while cooking.  Before serving, I drizzled with Thousand Island dressing on the top along with the remaining cheese.   I used Heinz Hamburger Dill Chips, as they most closely tasted like the traditional cheeseburgers I am used to.

I've made this recipe now for the second time. The first time made it pretty much as recipe states. My hubby loved it. I had a little too much mustard on mine, so the second time I put more of the stuff I liked and even sautéed some chopped onion and garlic, added mayo to mine and some relish, too. It was awesome. And both times I used grape tomatoes. I'd never thought of having a cheeseburger as a salad. This was Grrrreat!! No buns on hand, so made sourdough bread strips into garlic bread.  Thanks, Kristina for the great idea. P.S. Good idea to even let each person build their own..

A burger in a bowl.  I use grilled patties for this and coarsely dice them, skipped the buns and ketchup, and added blue cheese dressing.  Thousand Island dressing would be a classic also.  It's a salad. Have fun with it.

We really liked this.  I shredded American cheese from the deli and made a "dressing" from a mix of a half cup of mayo, a couple of TBS of ketchup and a tsp of mustard, which we really liked.  Next time I make burgers on the grill, I will make a bunch extra and freeze for this salad at a later date.

My family loved this.  My husband is a "meat/potatoes" guy and rarely eats salads.  He ate every bit of it!  Even the leftover!  One thing that I did different is I got the ex sharp cheddar and shredded it myself as opposed to the bagged stuff.  It tastes much fresher!  And it is so quick and easy to make.

The flavors worked perfectly to taste like cheeseburger.  I followed the recipe except that we don't like bread (rolls) mixed into the salad.  I toast the rolls whole and we fill them like a sloppy Joe, with any extra salad on the side.  Definitely will make this again.

I made this today for the first time and loved it. But I did make two changes. We are not fond of dill pickles, so I substituted sweet pickle relish and it's something I would put on a burger anyway. Also , based on other reviewers, I cut the ketsup in half and THAT was almost too much. I didn't make the bun croutons only because I didn't have any buns, but we didn't miss them.  If I were to rate this based on my changes, it would be close to a 10 and I will be making this again. It was easy,  quick to make and prep time was a breeze. You could almost prep this the night before, refrigerate, and be good to go just before supper. The only thing to cook is the burger and there is no stand time. Just mix in the onion, ketsup, mustard, and pickles and bring the heat back up again. While meat is cooking, just get the salad greens and everything else on the table and DONE!!!  Easy peasy!!

This may be my fault? followed recipe to the letter, Salad looked perfect and tasted so-so, for my taste recipe has way too much ketchup . We ate the salad for dinner and each person had an awful after taste within 2 hours. All ingredients used  were that day fresh, except for the prepared mustard and Ketchup. This recipe looked so good.

Will so make it again. We are seniors, and we both loved it. Very satisfying meal. I adjusted the recipe portions for just 2 people, but tried to stick to recipe. Just enough burger for 2 patties, and I cut the ketchup to 1/4 cup. Used white onion, all I had on hand.  So easy and quick to make. Great hot weather meal and so filling with meat and cheese. It does taste just like a cheese burger!!  5*s....Would recommend cutting the ketchup down in regular batch!

Simple, very tasty, & satisfying. I used 1/2 cup catsup rather than a whole cup and increased the mustard, but tweaks like that are of course personal preferences. We also used a small amount of Ken's Russian dressing on the salad before topping with ground beef mixture - really complimented the flavors. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not make any changes to the recipe but when it was done it was too dry and just plain. Tasted nothing like a Good juicy Cheeseburger. It was just OK. I will not make this again and that's saying something for me because I'm Just Like Popeye's Wimpy when it comes to Great Cheeseburgers. I'll just stick to Grilled Burgers and Oven Baked Fries. Less time and better taste.

You ma'am have touched a weak spot in my character. I love love love cheeseburger salads. A restaurant chain I grew up eating at occasionally a very similar salad on their  lunch menu and, oddly, I have always had trouble replicating the recipe.  This  recipe is very close to that salad I enjoyed in my childhood, the meat seasoning is off  a little bit, but  I will figure it out someday! This salad is really tasty as is anyway. Thank you for the recipe.  (After I had a few bites of the original no changes recipe I decided to make up some thinned down "secret" burger sauce to go on top as a dressing.)

Pretty darn good for something so simple. A tasty alternative.  We used spinach instead of lettuce as the base and poured blue cheese dressing over the whole dang thing.  Might try sweet pickles next time.

This was a pleasant surprise. I divided the toppings into two servings instead of six, and I think having a bit of everything in each bite is what makes it a cheeseburger salad instead of sloppy joes on lettuce. I used less ketchup as other reviewers recommended.
