We love this recipe!  We use about 1 lb turnips and 0.5 lbs potatoes.  The shallot crisps are key to the flavor, but we also like to make croutons from baguettes and put a few in each bowl.  We top the croutons w/ a mixture of gruyere cheese and mustard and they really compliment the soup.

Yummy!!  I didn't have quite enough turnips, so I added some celery to make up the volume.   We ended up having this on a very hot day, so after tasting it hot and loving it, we decided to try it cold, and it was great that way too.  Iâ€™m not sure which I liked better.  This recipe is going into the file of foods I make every few months.

If you like turnips I think this recipe is for you. While I don't care for them, I am trying to be fair to the recipe.b  I had a garden with too many turnips in it and needed to get rid of some, so I chose this recipe.  I used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 skim instead of 1/2 and 1/2, and I still think it turned out a little too thick, so I added some more milk.  At that point, for all you turnip lovers, it was probably about 4 stars.  However, I don't like turnips so I added some instant mashed potato flakes, milk and more sugar, and it was much better for me.  I guess, I wouldn't try this unless you absolutely love turnips.

A hearty delight!  A nice complement of spice and texture. (We used 1/4 tsp of cayenne).

A great way to use turnips.  The carmalizing process is very important for the overall taste. My whole family, including, my infant son, enjoyed this soup.

I tried this soup because my husband brought home a bag of turnips and I had no idea what to do with them.  The first batch I made I followed the recipe exactly, except used a little less cayenne and substituted skim milk. My husband and I loved the taste of the soup but were not thrilled with the lack of texture.  The next batch I made as before but left all the veggies unblended. I added the leftover pureed soup from the first batch and the result was a yummy, chunky. turnip stew.  I was hooked, now!  Had to go buy turnips for batch three - I increased the recipe by 1/3 so that I would have some to puree and add back to the pot. Added skim milk to the puree only, but next time I will add liquid from the pot instead so that my soup/stew will be thicker.  Will definitely need salt and pepper! SO GOOD!

Really good.  I used frozen diced turnip and it was fine.  I also halved the oil, subbed becel for butter, 1% for cream, and garnished with pumpkin seeds (reducing unnecessary fat but maintaining the crunch, as well as adding good fat and extra nutrients.)  Probably could add other vegs as well.  Good recipe.

A great soup if you like the taste of turnips. A lot of work but a delicious soup in the end. Much better if you use half and half rather than milk.

This is a wonderful soup with really great flavor.  I did add some potatoes and basil, but I have been eating it every single day since I made it and I am still not tired of it.  Great soup!

Pretty much followed the recipe as described and it came out great!  Turnips have a bitter taste, so if you haven't had them before, you might not like it the first time.  But once you get used to the flavor it's delicious.

I used 1 tbs oil and 3 tbs butter to give it more flavor.  It tasted great but was a little thin.  I might use 2 lbs turnips next time.

My husband really likes turnips and I am learning to cook and eat them.  We enjoyed this soup...he enjoyed it a little more than I did.  I'm not sure if I used the right amount of turnips but whatever the case, this soup was extremely turnipy tasting...good, but turnipy.  I used whole milk vs. the half and half and it worked nicely to thin out the puree.  This was a very fragrant soup as well.  My husband said he could smell it cooking while he was working outside!

Very tasty!  I didn't have paprika, so I used 1 tsp. of generic salt-free spice blend from Penzeys (Mural of Flavor) and 1 tsp. chili powder as a substitute.  I also had some green beans from my garden and added them in before blending.  I used yogurt on top and dried chives which added a really nice touch.  In the end, I would surely make this again.

Delicious soup. I replaced the half and half with 2% milk and it was still thick and satisfying. Next time, I will add even more paprika.

I'm not a huge turnip fan - I'm another one with a bumper crop of turnips this year! This soup was much tastier than I expected! I used packaged French Fried onions on top instead of frying shallots.  Very good!

This was a tasty soup. I changed the directions by cooking the turnip and onions, let cool, and then pureeing with the half and half. I tasted the results prior to all the seasonings. I would like to state that I liked the soup plain. I continued with seasoning the soup and it didn't taste as good. Served with "Pollo Mediteranean," "Roasted Vegetable Medley," and "Steamed Radishes."

Great flavor! This is a nice, comforting soup that would be perfect on a chilly fall day. The paprika and cayenne give it a subtle heat, and the texture is wonderful. I subbed coconut milk for cream, and used veg broth--otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The crispy shallots really add to it, but it's still delicious without. A definite keeper!

This was a great success! I made this with 1 lb. of turnips and 1 lb. of carrots because I needed to use up some things. I did not make the shallots and it was still wonderful, I served it with french bread which soaked up the soup nicely. This was an easy recipe, I didn't even have to shop for ingredients, and so much fun to make. I prepared the ingredients for the later steps while it sauteed. Can't wait to make it again and experiment with other veggies.

as huge a lover as i am of turnips, this was actually my first time attempting turnip soup, and i wasn't disappointed.  this was really delicious.  i've made it twice, both times not needing to use the full amount of milk suggested, and also adding some fresh cream.  i think the 2nd time i made it turned out better, the onions and turnip caramelised better and the consistency was perfect.  the crisped shallots really do add to the flavour.  i served it with warm dark brown crusty baguette and herb butter.

I didn't like this soup. I guess I don't like how turnips taste. I didn't have enough turnips so I made the soup with equal amounts of turnips and potatoes - and I still felt it had a very strong taste. I won't make it again.

Added twice the paprika and cayenne which gave the dish a great kick.  As I did not have any dry thyme, I used fresh thyme from the garden. First time cooking turnip, and eat it very infrequently. Loved the soup!

Delicious if you love turnips. My husband is lactose intolerant so I added probably about a half cup of lactaid instead of the half and half. Still good, thanks!

Made about 1.5 times this amount using home grown turnips. Added 1 lb of carrots as well. Was generous with the paprika and cayenne. Used no oil, only butter, and used 1% milk. DELICIOUS. Served with oven-toasted bred with gruyere cheese. Definitely a do-over.

Terrific recipe.  I followed exactly except I didn't have shallots, so I garnished with thinly sliced scallion tops, which tasted good and were also pretty.

Wow!  Great recipe.  I had to alter the time it took to reach each step. This recipe is for those who can be patient with the results of each step.  Great flavor, love it! I am amazed and inspired by the richness and complex flavors with such a low fat content.

Delicious! I used about half turnips and half yukon gold potatoes cause that's what I had.  And I used 1 cup half/half and 1/2 cup skim milk.  MMMMMMM

I've tried many recipes from this site and none have ever tasted this bad. (And I like turnips)

We had this soup for dinner and it was a little too sweet for us.  Other than that, it was very good and very easy to prepare.
