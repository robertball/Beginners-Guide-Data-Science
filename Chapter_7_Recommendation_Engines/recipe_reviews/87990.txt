This recipe was great when I modified it. It's not spicy at all, but that was fine. I had to add a lot more flour to get a thick enough consistency for a batter that would stick. I fried these at 375 degrees in a deep fat fryer. They were delicious! Just add more flour. I also like to salt the tomatoes while they are cooling.

Yum! I really enjoyed these. However, I did add 1/4 cup of corn meal to the batter, it helps to make the batter stick to the tomatoes better.

I fried a 'test' tomato slice for taste and am glad I did because it was a bit bland for our taste so I added a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning and it was much more flavorful.  Nice change from the flour/cornmeal breading.

My boyfriend has begged me for fried green tomatoes all summer, so I finally broke down today and decided on this recipe. They were great! I used ground cayenne as a substitute and rolled in panko bread crumbs after dredging in the batter.  Fabulous, I will make again and again!!!! I only gave the 4 stars because I added salt which I feel is a must with a recipe like this. Love the batter idea instead of flour, egg, bread crumb.....

Thank you for your comments on this recipe. I didn't make the recipe real spicy just in case some do not like the kick to it. Therefore, just add the crushed red pepper flakes to your taste more for spicier. I used Bud Light for the beer. The batter should not be real thick but you should have a light thin coating so you taste the tomatoe more than the flour. Thank you again for your reviews :)

This is the BEST recipe I have ever made for the fried green tomatoes!  I have tried several recipes and this one is amazing!!  I made it exactly as it called and took them down to my husband and his fishing buddies and they were a huge hit.  Thank you sooooo much for sharing!

Very bland and proportions seem to be off.  As written, the batter is nothing like pancake batter, but more like a thin soup and doesn't stick well.   Not much flavor.  Also I ended up with a ton of batter, more than enough for 10-15 tomatoes or more.

Tip to those looking to make FGT for the first time, the key is in the tomato.   It should be the centerpiece of the dish.  Many recipes suggest coating the tomato with so much batter that it ends up hiding the flavor of the tomato.  If you're going to do that, you might as well use eggplant or zucchini.   Choose tomatoes that are just on the verge of turning color, maybe even a tinge of pink beginning to show.  If they are too "green", they won't have any flavor to them.  Too ripe, and they will turn to mush.

These were perfect, as far as fried green tomatoes go.  So yummy, I barely ate anything else that we had prepared for dinner!  And very easy to make.  Loved the tartness of the tomatoes.  The only thing that wasn't quite right is that we could not taste any spiceyness at all, even though I doubled the red pepper flakes.  So we sprinkled some Sriracha sauce on them and were very happy!

This is an amazing recipe! If you prefer a strong beer flavor, use the whole bottle (12 oz), or if not, use half beer and half milk. To get the batter to really adhere to the tomatoes, dry the slices thoroughly with paper towels before dipping. These were so good we made a meal of them and tall glasses of iced tea!

FORGET trying to make fried green tomatoes the way mom used to.... This recipe is wonderful. I didn't use the whole can of beer only about 3/4 of the can.  Batter was perfect, and cooked to a beautifull golden brown.  Used the remainder of batter, added a bit of cornmeal and finished it up with okra!! PERFECTION

Finally found a fried green tomato batter to make the tomatoes crunchy.  This is lacking salt and that is remedied by putting it on my own serving.  We also topped it with parmesan cheese.  Wouldn't it be amazing served with homemade marinara? YUM!

As others commented-good, but not spicy.  Next time I will add some cayenne pepper to the batter.

Delicious! I used a cast-iron skillet and it didn't take as long to fry these (def. not 5 minutes). Added cajun seasoning per other reviews and they were excellent.

These are great. I add some cornmeal, but I like them that way. Other than that, I did it just as described. 

Thanks for the great photo too! I MUCH prefer recipes with photos. I should take a few of my stuff, but I've got four kids and food does not stick around long enough!

My brother, boyfriend, and dad loved these! I had to add a little more flour, about 1/4 cup, and I decided to add a 1/2 teaspoon of paprika. I am going to buy more green tomatoes from the  farmers market and definitely make this again.

I made this exactly like the recipe said, except that I didn't know I didn't have eggs when I made it. So I covered them in Panko before frying them. They turned out awesome!!

These were really good! I also used half beer and half milk and dried the tomato slices before I dipped them in the batter. The batter was so good I used it on some green peppers, too. Great!

Thought it went a little easier drying the green tomatoes   on a paper towel, salted on both sides for a hour, to fry better. Then dust them on both sides with flour before putting in the pancake like batter.  
Found it to be just the right kinda spicy flavor. 
"I choose this beer batter on veggies, and sea food; to try. "

I would have given it 5 but I had to improvise with some of the ingredients and technically I have never had fried green tomatoes, so I have nothing to compare them to, but they were delicious! I used wheat flour because that's what I had. I subbed the beer for chicken stock and added some canned green chilies to the wet batter. Next time, I will add more red pepper flakes to make it a little hotter.
