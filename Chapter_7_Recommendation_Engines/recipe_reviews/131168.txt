Not bad - it needs a little "zing" to brighten it up a bit though. I'll make this again because its super easy and flavorful (minus peas and Brussels sprouts), but perhaps add a bit of cayenne or some jalapenos just to get a little kick and wake to up a bit.

This is the best venison stew my family has ever had.  My son continually asks me when I am making it again.
