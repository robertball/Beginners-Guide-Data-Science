I lightened a bit by using 2% skim mozzarella, fat free ricotta, skim milk, and  used baby bell mushrooms which gave it a meaty texture.  It was tasty, but I would have liked more filling.  There was an awful lot of pasta, but IMO it was light on the mushroom filling.  From a presentation point of view, it was pretty flat, unlike a traditional lasagna.  And two Tbsp of flour will not thicken 4 cups of milk, took more like 5.  Thanks for sharing Gina.

I made it pretty much as written, but (thanks to another review) doubled everything except the noodles and milk (actually, I probably used 4 cups ricotta).  I used jarred, roasted red peppers instead of dicing fresh, to add a layer of colour.  I also added white pepper to the bechamel.  Jessica, I think it's essential that you incorporate the milk slowly and whisk continuously.  Also, I cooked it for 45 minutes with just the white sauce on top, then removed the foil, added the cheese and cooked another 10 minutes, then broiled for a few, to brown the top.  It was good and I will make it again, but might add some spinach or shaved Brussels sprouts.  Great concept, just needs a little tweaking!!

Prepared exactly as written and it came out way too saucy. Also I think that medium heat may be too high when adding the milk as the milk separated.

Everyone loved it even the meat eater in the House!
We added spinach between each layer which was really nice.
Good luck with it, it’s an easy recipe to follow. Thanks for it.

I didn’t have ricotta so I used cream cheese instead but it turned out great! I also used cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. One thing I had trouble with was the white sauce, afterwards I found out that you have to wait until the butter flour mixture thickens and then you add the milk little by little

I made this for my vegetarian daughter, we will need a bigger dish next time as it was a big hit. I did leave out the ricotta and used lactose free cheeses as my son is lactose intolerant

We all loved the resulting taste of this recipe, thanks!  I did use varieties of mushrooms , Portabella and the ones we see here, and Baby Bellas.  I find it makes the flavors richer. I added some chopped shallots and green onions also chopped, less garlic, since it is in the jarred sauce we had.  I also used 2% skim mozzarella, and normal ricotta as described here though I have successfully substituted even the smooth, low fat cottage cheese as a way to have a lower-fat ingredient, before and both were very successful!  I would add more of the mushrooms as they cook down quickly, and perhaps as done before , other vegetables, including the red and green peppers, perhaps squash, cut thinly, and well-drained spinach, as the many-layers idea is great but still they did not fill up the pan as described.  One way I do lasagna differently was shared by a great cook her mom used, which is to pour a little cream or half and half, cow milk though now I use coconut and almond milks, along the edges of the pan before cooking it, rather than making an often recommended cooked version of this.  The flavor was incredibly good, and I will use this recipe again.  It makes a lot of servings!

Made this dish along with regular lasagna for some vegetarian friends one night. Never thought I would say this lasagna was every bit as good (or maybe better?) than my regular recipe... A really nice alternative!!!
