I needed to find a way to use up the mint that's taking over my garden, and while this put only a tiny dent in the crop, it was so delicious I'll make it again and again. I served it with curried chicken kabobs one night, grilled shrimp another night, and as a flavor agent on potroast sandwiches. It's amazing, versatile stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe - it's the second time I made it. Last night, I served it for Easter dinner with Holiday Leg of Lamb (from this site) and everyone loved it. I added a little extra cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick and I made it a day ahead of time.

Just made this to go with the Coriander Cumin rubbed pork chops from this site and it is delish! It's just sweet and tangy enough to to with the exotic herbs of the chops!

Put this on a lemony-garlic Tilapia and it added a nice burst of freshness!  Good way to use up a bunch of mint.

Awesome!! It goes great with the "holiday leg of lamb" from this site. It's incredibly easy to make and can be made ahead.

Excellent!! I made this to go with Lamb chops. I did decrease the recipe to 12 servings which is actually enough for about 4 servings. I added a little bit of minced garlic since that's a staple in this household. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! :-)

I made this to serve with Syrian Bread- also from this site- it was quick, easy and very delicious.  A very sweet and spicy flavor, minty, but not overpowering.

An easy, delicious recipe.  I had this with Roast Leg of Lamb With Rosemary from this site.  I had a 2.5 pound roast and cut the recipe by 1/3 which was just right.  Thanks.

We have a ton of mint in the garden; it is a weed.  This recipe makes an easy, relatively short prep time for a great accompaniment for lamb.  Tangy sweet.  Easy to adjust to taste.

Made this chutney on Easter Sunday to go along with a great lamb dish on allrecipes (Holiday Leg of Lamb).  I thought this dish was awesome.  It went really well with the lamb and even the prime rib we grilled.  Very refreshing.  I purchased two little packets of mint from the store.  This gave me enough mint for half the recipe which was plenty for the meal.  I will definitely make this again!
