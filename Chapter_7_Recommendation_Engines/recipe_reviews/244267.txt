Really, really good.  Made it with barely warmed flatbread.  Doubled the dates and balsamic.  Substituted pine nuts (which I toasted) we had lying around for the pumpkin seeds.  Sliced an avocado and put it on top.  A great taste.  Like something from California Pizza Kitchen.

Loved this recipe!
I didn't think the seeds added that much, but my husband really liked them.
The only thing I did differently is that used a pita, and baked them on 350 for 10min.
I will make this one again, and again.

Great recipe!  However, vegans beware! This is listed in the vegan section, but most  naan bread I've found is made with milk and butter.  I made my own vegan naan using a recipe from a different site and it turned out delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

What a great snack (or light lunch - which is what this was for me today)! You get the sweetness from the chopped dates, the garlicky flavor from the hummus and then the peppery arugula! I used a balsamic "glaze" which added a bit a sweetness as well. Just fold the naan in half, and take the perfect bite! Yummy!
