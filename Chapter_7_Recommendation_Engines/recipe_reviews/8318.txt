This cake is good. I've never made a cake without a liquid and found the batter to be so thick that my old model mixer started to burn so I added 1/4 cup milk. Recipe did not call for any flavoring but I added 1t.vanilla and 1/2t.almond. I cooked it for the full 1-1/2 hr and it was starting to burn. This may be why it is dry. I look forward to trying it again because although dry it is still quite tasty.
