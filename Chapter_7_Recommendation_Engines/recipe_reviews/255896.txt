I've been wanting to make this for awhile now, but was having difficulty finding the raspberry chipotle sauce. I was telling my BFF about it, and low and behold, what does she bring me when she came to Thanksgiving dinner? A bottle of the roasted raspberry chipotle sauce that she had ordered online, just for me! I am so happy that she gifted me a bottle of it, because now I can make this sandwich for my lunch whenever I want! It is SO tasty! Sweet and savory all in one. I really enjoyed it. So worth the trip to the store to get a loaf of sourdough too. Oh, and I served it with a small cup of the sauce on the side as well, for extra dipping. Yum!

Could this be any more delicious? Nope. This is the tops. The sweet, smoky flavor with spicy cheese is amazing. My husband liked them so much, he asked me to make them for his lunch. Wrapped in a bit of aluminium foil, they heat up quickly in the oven and are just as delicious. Now his coworkers all want the recipe! I made the raspberry chipotle sauce from scratch using the recipe from AllRecipes. Update: make this in your waffle maker...yum!

I made these tonight for my husband and myself. Trust me when I say that as amazing as this recipe is, we made it even more savory by adding strips of bacon to our sandwiches. The salty goodness of the bacon combine with the sweetness of the raspberry chipotle was phenomenal! My husband says hands down that this recipe is a definite keeper.

Who doesn't love a grilled cheese? But with chipotle sauce?  This one definitely piqued my curiosity. I didn't have the roasted raspberry chipotle sauce but I did have pomegranate chipotle sauce on hand and some sharp cheddar I hand sliced. Oh my cheesy goodness! This has got to be the best grilled cheese I think I have ever had before. Perfect blend of smoky spice and was a nice treat for lunch today. Thanks, Brian, for creating this golden little gem. I never would have thought this combination would work for me. I was mistaken!

Another awesome Borden recipe! My family loves grilled cheese sandwiches, and adding the sweet raspberry and chipotle sauce elevated this lovely lunch to cheesy, smokey and sweet gooness. Best grilled cheese I have ever had!

Cheesy, fruitty, and oh so good! A great twist on grilled cheese. I couldn't find raspberry chipolte sauce so I used raspberry instead. The cheese melted perfectly and had such a great taste! Will make again and again!

Admittedly I used raspberry preserves instead of the raspberry chipotle but this was great! I love the sweet twist the raspberry lends to this grown up grilled cheese. This is an easy way to make an everyday sandwich a bit more elegant. Plus it's really pretty!

So delicious! An easy switch up to the traditional grilled cheese sandwich. Will make this again for sure. For the adults, I didn't modify a thing. For the kids, I took the author's advice and used strawberry jam instead of the spicy chipotle sauce.
