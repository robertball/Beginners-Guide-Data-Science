I've been making this recipe for years and it is a family favorite.  It is difficult to get the seams entirely sealed shut with so much filling in them, so I finally started using two cans of crescents with one recipe of the chicken filling.  I also skip the butter and crumbs on the top.  I find that making sure that the crescents stay refrigerated until the last minute makes them easier to handle and seal as well.  I even leave the second roll of crescents in the frig until I'm ready for them. This makes a really quick meal if you use canned chicken breast as well--two 5 oz. cans is perfect.  I'm not a huge fan of canned chicken, but with the other ingredients added to this dish, it works well.  I also seal mine by bringing the opposite corners up to each other more like a pinwheel.  I like that presentation better--but that's just personal preference ;)

  This is not the healthiest meal I make, but I just don't make it all the time.  My family is always happy when they see it on the table though!

I cooked the the chicken with butter after marinating it with Dijon dressing, a small amount of ranch, about two cloves of garlic, and creole seasoning, I cooked the mixture into the chicken. Then followed the recipe. I used garlic bread crumbs on top and it turned out amazing. I think next time I will use 2 crescent packages and make smaller rolls instead of pockets because the crescent roll exterior seems too thin to support the heavy mixture inside.

I love this recipe. I skip the onions tho and add fresh spinach into the cheese mixture. You really can play a lot with what you add in the filling... Endless options!

We have this frequently and the kids love it.  We add 1 can of cream of chicken soup to the filling, and use a complete package of cream cheese instead of 1/3 pkg.  We also brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle on crushed garlic/cheddar croutons and parmesan cheese before baking. We bake per crescent can baking times and temps until golden brown.  Serve it up with some chicken Rice A Roni and a veggie and you have it made!

I'm a super health freak! I use low fat cream cheese or Neufchâtel cheese instead of regular cream cheese. Also, I use low fat crescent rolls...and I make a can of cream of mushroom soup and use it like a gravy. Just put a little on the piece you get and you're good to go! I don't use the bread crumbs...but very yummy!

Super tasty, but not very filing for the huge calorie load. We skipped the crumbs on top and swapped dried chives for the minced onions.

LOVE this recipe! And my husband loves it more lol. Great as is, or you can add some vegg & stuff to kick it up (and ALL leftover meats work). Current favorite uses jalapeño cream cheese, some diced celery & onion, dill & garlic. YUM!!

This recipe was very good. I added a bit more cream cheese and some green onions. I also seasoned the chicken breaks with Italian seasoning and garlic, it really added some flavor.

I cut up chicken breasts pretty small and cook with onions and frozen or canned sweet corn. I then add that to a bowl with the cream cheese and butter. Finally I use the crescent sheets instead of trying to pinch the seams close. I also leave in the fridge until last possible second. I do not use the cracker crumbs on top. I serve it with a salad and it’s so good.

This turned out to be a big hit with my hubby! I brushed on a little extra butter and it turned out very flaky. It tastes better than the crescent rolls by themselves like most refrigerated dough. The next time I make them I will add some finely chopped celery for some extra texture and flavor. It is pretty easy to make the four pieces of dough by rolling out the whole package on to waxed paper and separate into four pieces. Keep the dough in the fridge until just before making, the dough is easier to work with if it is good and cold.

I haven't made these in years, but came across this recipe and decided that it was time to make them again.
Only changes I made was to use onion powder because I was out of onions, added a bit of shredded cheddar, and used crushed vegetable Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.

The family loved them.  Had leftover beer can chicken from my bbq the day before so needed a way to repurpose.  Found this and thought it was easy and the kids would love it.  Yes to both.  However next time I might just use refrigerated biscuits instead of the crescent rolls.  Won't have to deal with perforated dough.

My mother and I have been making these for years my family loves them.  I also make gravy out of cream of chicken soup with a little bit of milk added to thin it out.  We add that to the top of the pockets.

My mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid, and it is still a favorite dish to this day!  I use crushed croutons instead of crackers- gives it more flavor, and my family always uses warmed, thinned out cream of mushroom soup as a gravy over the pockets-delicious ??

I'm going to give it 3 stars because it smelled and looked great. The dough on the bottom wasn't any where near done. It looked like I had pulled it out of the tube. After making a few other things and they weren't done I got a new oven thermometer. So I'm going to try it again and see what happens. I'll try to do a update

I boiled 2 chicken breasts.  (bring to a rolling boil, remove from heat and let it sit, covered about 20 minutes.)  I found that if you gently knead the rolls after filling it stays closed fairly well.  I added about 1/4 cup of brown mustard, and used 2 green onions instead of minced onions.  The brown mustard cut the super-sweet flavor of the cream cheese just enough.

This was a hit (except with my son who doesn't like chicken pot pie.). I added 1/4 tsp chicken base and substituted one T of milk with 1 T of hot water to dissolve chicken base.  Also added some frozen peas and shredded cheddar cheese.

I  made this using the cream of chicken soup, dijon dressing and substituted dried chives for the onion. I also cooked the chicken in the marinade before placing it in the crescent roll "pouches " I like the pinwheel fold better as well. I will Definitely be making this again! Thank you for the great recipe! !

AMAZING DINNER! I added a few more seasonings, just because I'm not a big fan of cream cheese. Adobo, garlic powder, onion powder, and johnnys all in very small amounts. I also used Italian bread crumbs on top instead of cracker crumbs. Super easy to make and my boys loved it!
