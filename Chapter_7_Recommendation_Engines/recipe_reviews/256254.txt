Made this for my diabetic Step-Dad. He & Mom both said it was the best they'd ever had. Used ground turkey, used slightly less quinoa, a little over a cup & added an extra 7 minutes cooking time. Super moist & delicious. A fantastic way to incorporate veggies for anti-veggie folks. Will make this many times in the future. Can't give this one enough stars!

Will make again with some adjustments: needs more flavor, will use less quinoa or add a second egg for better texture since it crumbled when cut.

I made this as close to the recipe as I could with the ingredients I had access to and my diet requirements - I used rice instead of quinoa and green pepper instead of spinach, and I omitted the soy sauce and used low sodium tomato soup instead of ketchup or BBQ sauce on top since I need to eat lower sodium and sugar.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out since the raw mixture was so wet and kind of a sloppy mud-like consistency, but it turned out perfect, moist, delicious and amazing!  This has gone straight into my favourite recipes box.

I made it for dinner  and add a tsp of Mrs Dash to bump the taste up a little. Very good I'll make it again

I followed the recipe to a T and this did not turn out well.  There was too much quinoa, it was crumbly and it lacked flavor.

Having a stalk of celery in this recipe appears too much celery...Please clarify how many ribs of celery should be in the recipe?        one rib ?  or a group of many ribs that are attached to 1 stalk?          I'm looking forward to cooking this healthy recipe.        thanks

Wonderful recipe for a healthier version of meatloaf. I added peas along with the carrots and spinach. My boyfriend ate it for leftovers with no complaints. I accidentally used too much quinoa but the texture was still good and held together when sliced. I'm planning to use an altered version of this recipe for meatballs tonight!

Really good, but took about 10 minutes longer to cook!
