Changes I (inevitably) made - used ghee instead of oil, ground fenugreek instead of seeds, and ground ginger instead of fresh. I really love the flavor of fenugreek but Husband does not at all. I liked the low fatness of using yogurt, but I would have liked to add some heavy cream for a little more rich flavor. This is a good basic recipe that I would like to play around with. Thanks!

Machhli (not machili) is fish in Hindi. The recipe call for a chicken!! It would have been more accurate to call it Avadhi dahi MURG (chicken). Generally Avadhi cooking has marination involved and spices (delicately balanced) are used, with 3 Tb spoons of chili powder and 3 tbsps of green chilies there is no Avadhi cooking, this is recipe straight out of the Anarchist's Handbook. No offence is intended but pl check from some of your Indian friends who are from Uttar Pradesh, India (earstwhile Avadh)
