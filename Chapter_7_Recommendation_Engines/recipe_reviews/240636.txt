We love this stuff, made a batch last week with milk , had no cream, we also added 1 cup rum,1 cup brandy and 1/2 cup Jack Daniels.We put it in mason jars and let is sit a few days& boy did it taste good, very sweet! Just finished up another batch for Christmas gatherings this weekend!! Will try it with the heavy cream next time, I am sure it will be even better. Thanks for a great recipe
