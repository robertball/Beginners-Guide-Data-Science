This was a brilliant twist on candied yams!  I loved the pomegranate juice with the starch, and found it a lovely foil to baked ham.  I eliminated the water, as I wanted a stronger flavour, but found both mine and the original quite tasty!  Well done!

We weren't to impressed with this recipe.  It is easy but the flavor just wasn't there in ours.

I think the vinegar overpowered everything else.   I would like to try again leaving out the vinegar and subbing honey for the brown sugar.
