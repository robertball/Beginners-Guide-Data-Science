I modified according to what another reviewer suggested and this recipe tasted fantastic: decrease sugar to 5 tbsp, decrease vanilla to 1/2 tsp, decrease bisquick to 1 1/4 cup and increase cornmeal to 1/2 cup. Just the right amount of corn taste. I will be making this again!

Best sweet corn muffins ever!  I made a few changes that made them AMAZING! First off, I took the baking mix down to 1 1/4 c. and increased the corn meal to 1/2 c. I also only used 5 tbsp. of sugar and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Lightly sweet and the perfect amount of corn taste!

Very good corn muffins - although I'm not sure if I'd go so far as to call them the "best ever". They were very easy to make and whip up in a pinch. I cut back on the sugar using 1/4 cup and then added a Tbsp. of honey and left out the vanilla entirely. Like others, I used 1 & 1/4 cups of biscuit baking mix and upped the cornmeal to 1/2 cup which worked out well. In order to ensure a moist muffin, I used 2/3 cup of buttermilk vs. milk. I baked these for 20 minutes and they were lightly golden brown on top. These are perfect for chili, soup, or as a side for pulled pork.

delicious! i experimented a little to make them less fat and calories and the things i did worked...i only put 2 tablespoons of butter (i actually used smart beat spead), and one table spoon of apple sauce, 2 egg whites instead of the whole 2 eggs, and 5 1/2 tablespoons of sugar insead of 9 and they turned out great! I also used reduced-fat bisquick! *=o)

Very easy to follow and very good results.  The recipe says it makes 12 muffins and I came out with just 6 med. size so perhaps 12 is a typo??

These were very good!  I love corn bread/muffins and this is one of the best I have tried, the only thing is is that they are very sweet, so if that's not what you are looking for these aren't for you...

This recipe does not cut it as a "corn" muffin.  However it makes the best ever cupcakes by  adjusting the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I got 12 small cupcakes.

These were great! Cake-like and sweet. I made 6 muffins out of the batter instead of 12 because we like to have a nice big top on them. I used low fat biscuit mix and they still tasted wonderful. Will definitely make them again and again.

These are great! I needed a quick and easy corn bread recipe and this was it. My KIDS even loved it! I baked the recipe in my cast iron pan and it turned out wonderful. I would recommend these and also for you to consider putting this recipe on the CORN BREAD listing also. Thanks again.

I have been making corn muffins and bread for a long time. The one I have been making is pretty good, but this one great. Being from Maine, I like to add some maple syrup to it.

This recipe is good, but it was too sweet for me.  Also, I think the bisquick mix/corn ratio was off.  Too little corn flavor.  But texture and flavors were good, just not what I was looking for in a Corn Muffin personally.

These were AWSOME!!  I've been looking for a recipe to duplicate the corn muffins at our favorite barbecue restaurant and these come as close as they possibly could.  I followed the recipe exact except at the end, I added 1 cup frozen corn and about a 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  They were moist and DELICIOUS!!  This is the only corn muffin I will ever make again.

These were a little sweet for my taste.  They tasted more like breakfast muffins (which I have been eating them as) than with dinner.  But they definately taste good.

I have never made corn muffins from scratch.  Was very surprised at the outcome.
Very tasty, very moist and delicious.  By the end of the night we ate 8 out of the
12 the recipe makes!  Definately a great snack for kids!  Our son loved them!  - Connie

oh my God! I've been searching for a nice, soft, corn muffin and yours was the first one I tried. In fact this is the first time I've been to this site. I've used other recipes with great disappointment-they always come out so dense and hard. This truely is the "Best Ever Corn Muffins". Thanks for sharing your recipe Kelly!

As far as corn muffins go, these are super yummy! My kids scoffed them up. I did take the advice of a few other reviewers which seemed to make sense...knock the bisquick down to 1 1/4 c & boost the cornmeal to 1/2 c. That was the only alteration & they turned out perfectly moist and tasted just right. A keeper, thank you!

I received rave reviews for these "sweet" corn muffins at a recent cookout.  I will probably make them again, but try to find a way to make them less dry.

These are AWESOME!  They were so sweet and moist!  I only got 6 muffins out of this batch using muffin tins.  Maybe using cupcake tins you would get 12.  I'm not really sure what that was about.  Thanks for the great recipe, Kelly!  I will use it again and again!

Mmmmmm, I think that vanilla extract was the yummy ingredient!  These are so sweet, you could just slather them with butter and skip the honey!  I did get twelve muffins with a bit of batter left over.

EASY and quick to make.  Truly DELICIOUS!  Perfect accompaniment for salad, soup, or regular meal.  My grandchildren, ages 13 and 9, really liked them.  I wrote out the recipe for these so my granddaughter could learn to make them.  This has become my #1 cornbread recipe.  My thanks and appreciation for sharing to Kelly.

These were the BEST corn muffins EVER!! i altered the biscuit/cornmeal ratio like some other reviews and it was perfect!  My muffins were ready in 15 minutes and came right out of the muffin pan.

These had a thick "eggy" consistency. Thats the only way i know how to describe it. It didnt taste like corn muffins at all. Not even close. I tried adding more cornmeal, less sugar, less biscuit mix, nothing worked. i was only able to get 11 cupcake sized muffins and they were done in 17 minutes. As stated and also with changes I didnt get a desired result.

1st of all, I made cornbread in a cast iron skillet instead of muffins. I didn't have any bisquick, so I just added 2 t of baking powder and about 1/2 t salt to all purpose flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I had to leave for about an hour so had hubby listen for the timer & gave him instructions on what to do. Well got home and was done, what HE did though was to turn off the oven leaving cornbread in the oven while he took off for a while. To my surprise, it was done to perfection. This was the best cornbread I've ever made! Passed hubby's test as well. This will now be my cornbread recipe from now on. I may justturn off the oven and let it finish, myself next time.

OUR FAMILY FAVORTIE!  If you know what you're looking for ahead of time, there is no way these muffins should get anything less than 5 stars.  We make these every time we smoke brisket, these are so light and sweet, they pair up perfectly with a heavy dish like BBQ. If you are looking for a light sweet corn muffin, this one's a keeper.  If you want a "southern style" muffin, look for a recipe that has buttermilk, and almost no sugar and a lot more corn meal, that's pairs up better with chili and tex-mex dishes!

I have made these muffins twice now and my family loves them.  The first time I made them I cut the tops off and stuffed them with a tomato bruschetta type mixture for an apetizer.  They were delish!  Very easy recipe.

These muffins are SO good.  Did make some changes, though.  Cut the bisquick back to 1 1/4 cups, increase the cornmeal to 1/2 cup, and lower the vanilla to 1 teaspoon or even 1/2 teaspoon.  I thought the sugar amount was perfect. You can even sprinkle some cornmeal over the tops of the muffins before you bake them if you like a crunchier top.  I will be making these constantly.  Thanks!!

Yummy but way too sweet and the vanilla taste is pretty strong (and I love vanilla - usually double or triple it but in this recipe I needed to use ~1/2) - I cut the sugar in half and they still tasted more like cupcakes than cornbread.  Other than that, great texture, delicious, easy to make.  I'll make them again and again (just with less sugar!); UPDATE - these are great when first made but are only so-so the next morning and pretty much inedible after that.  Not necessarily a bad thing - just make only what you are going to eat :)

I am always looking for something new to try, and today was the day for these muffins.  I have eaten quite a few corn muffins in my day, but none quite compare to this recipe.  The flavor was great (even though I questioned using vanilla in them).  The texture was wonderful; light and airy....unlike the "standard" corn muffin.  I did however bake them in a LAGRE 6 Cup non-stick muffin pan (I like MUFFINS, not cupcakes), without the liners and sprayed with a bit of cooking spray, they popped out just wonderfully, and were done in just 25 minutes.  I immediately ate 2 smothered with some butter and a nice hot cup of coffee.  This recipe will definitely be added to my large and growing collection!  Thanks!

I've tried many, many cornbread recipes over the years and have always found them to be far too dry.

But these are perfectly - MOIST! The sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness without turning it into a "dessert" muffin. Great with a pork roast.

I made minor alterations - I increased cornmeal to 1/2 cup, reduced biscuit mix to 1 1/4 cups and added 1/2 cup of frozen corn [thawed].

Definitely earned a spot in my favorite recipes file.

Pros:  super easy and have all the ingredients! For me, the cons were:  very dense, and with soup didn't add the "crumble, soak" factor of a traditional cornbread.   And, very sweet -- my daughter liked them a lot!

My family did not care for the vanilla flavor and they felt they were too sweet.  I would omit the vanilla and cut down the sugar next time.

A DEFINATE make again. I used the alterations suggested on earlier reviews.  I would use the 9 T. sugar next time though as I like that level of sweetness.  This produces an extremely moist muffin. The test will be if they maintain their moistness (sealed in a bag of course) until tomorrows sunday lunch. Thank you all for the the initial recipe and all the suggestions to personalize it. Great cooks!!!

These are really good.  The vanilla gives them a nice sweetness.  I add yellow corn kernels, diced jalapenos from the jar, and grated cheddar cheese to the batter before baking.

These were pretty good.  The taste was excellent.  They stuck to the muffin cups like nobody's business, though.  I guess next time I will use melted butter or oil instead of non-stick spray.  Non-stick spray did not work AT ALL.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and made 12 nice sized muffins.  This is definitely a sweet muffin and I could tell some of my guests would prefered a more cornbread type muffin. But I like a sweet corn muffin and this is as good as any I've ever had!

These are soooo good.  I ate three out of the oven with butter.  It is sweet and I could see eating these with breakfast, chili, snack time, etc.  Very easy and kid friendly.  I will make these often.

This was better than I thought it would be. Nice light texture and good flavor. I added some corn kernels and doubled the amount of corn meal. Also omitted vanilla, which seemed like an odd thing to put in corn muffins (the amount of vanilla must be a misprint - I don't put that much in my desserts). It takes just as much time to prepare a traditional, from-scratch recipe, which is what I'll probably do in the future because we prefer a denser result. But very good overall.

This recipe is tasty, but being a true Southerner (I'm from Mississippi) this is definitely a muffin and not cornBREAD.  This is because of the ratio of baking mix (flour) to cornmeal.  Not a good choice for use with greens, beans, chili, etc.

I think the important thing to remember is that is not going to be the best corn muffin ever ~ but it is the best corn muffin using BAKING BISCUIT MIX ~ I modified according to what other reviewer's suggested and this recipe tasted pretty good: decrease sugar to 5 tbsp, decrease vanilla to 1/2 tsp, decrease bisquick to 1 1/4 cup and increase cornmeal to 1/2 cup. Just the right amount of corn taste.

Switch out the measurements for the cornmeal and biscuit mix, leave out the vanilla, then you can call this corn muffins. Oh yes cut the sugar to 1 tbsp.

This are amazing!  I did change the bisquick to cornmeal ratio (1 1/4cup bisquick and 1/2 cup cornmeal).  

I will make these again!

I used my own homemade whole wheat baking mix and buttermilk instead of regular milk. I did add a little more buttermilk (almost another quarter cup) because whole wheat flour tends to be more dry than regular AP flour. These were okay--more like cornmeal flavored biscuits than muffins. I'm glad I used my own baking mix because if I'd used something like Bisquick, I think these would have been way too sweet.

I don't know if my review will really "count" as there were drastic changes to the recipe. Firstly I lowered the amount of sugar like several other reviews to 5 tbsp and I was going to add a little bit of honey but I spaced and forgot. Also when I was putting together the bisquit and cornmeal, I found that I only had 3/4 cup of bisquit left- erg. So I upped the cornmeal to 1 cup. I prayed that it wouldnt turn out bad and they didnt! My kids loved them and I like how they were more like corn bread since we were eating it with chili. This recipe is awesome because even if you have to alter it (due to whats in the cupboard) everything should work out. Note: I used buttermilk instead of whole milk  but I don't know that it really makes a difference

These were super yummy, easy to make, and ingredients I usually have on hand.  However, like many, the muffins stuck to the pan. I greased instead of sprayed, like some suggested, but they still stuck. This happened on both the full size and mini pans, so it wasn't just my pan. Next time I will flour as well. Maybe that will keep them from sticking.  I did add a can of drained whole kernel corn, just because I like whole corn in my bread.

Delicious light puffs of cake muffin!  Really good, but very different than what I expected.  They had a very fine, light cake consistancy; they'd be great with tea.

I was making the corn muffin recipe on the back of the cornmeal box for years; it was never all that good. I came across this recipe and my whole family loved them! They taste like they are right from a bakery. So good, great recipe!

I reduced the sugar to 5 Tbs and swapped out 1/4 c. of the biscuit mix with 1/4 c. extra cornmeal for more corn flavor. It makes 12 cupcake-size muffins.  If you end up making 12 muffins, watch the baking time because 20 minutes is too long.  My first batch came out tasty, but on the drier side.

Wow I was looking for a cornbread recipe to go with chili & this is not it! This is however, one of the best white cake cupcake mixes I have ever had. Used less sugar & vanilla (couldn't figure out why cornbread would have 1 T vanilla). Only needed 1/3 cup of milk. I will try these later with a cream cheese frosting. If you are looking for a cornbread type recipe this is not it. If you like white cake mix this is the bomb!

These deserve 5 stars because of the taste and the fact they are so moist.  I only give them 4 because you really can't taste the corn at all.  These do have a sweet taste to them and work well as a dinner muffin, but if you are looking for a corn muffin, you don't taste the corn.

Just made these and they turned out really good. I made changes like others suggested. Lowered sugar to 7 tbsp. Lowered bisquick to 1 1/4 and then increased the corn meal to 1/2 cup. Lowered the vanilla to 1 tsp. I know it sounds like a lot of changes but really it was just tweaking it a bit so the sweetness would come out right. I made 6 large muffins and then 24 minis for my kids bento lunches :-).

My husband took one bite of these muffins and didn't stop raving until dinner was over! "That's what cornbread should taste like," he said. :-D The only modifications I made were cutting down the butter (2 tbs. b/c I ran out!)and sugar (4 tbs.) and milk(1/4 c) because I added a small can of cream corn. I also used 1 1/4 C Jiffy mix and 2/3 Corn meal, so it would taste more like cornbread than cake. This  was a great recipe and I'm excited to try adding other ingredients to it. (My husband suggested chocolate chips, we'll see how it goes)Thanks so much!

This came out really good.  My daughter is on a wheat free, gluten free, sugar and dairy free diet.  With that said, I used an all purpose rice flour mix, soy milk and splenda.  I also added a bit of honey to balance out the splenda.  I put the mixture into a 9-inch pie plate and baked for 25 min.  It turned golden brown and evenly baked.  We all loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I love these corn muffins! I mix the wet stuff up first, add sugar, blend baking mix with the corn meal, then I sift the baking mix/corn meal into the wet mix. 75% better than the original recipe! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was truly the best corn muffins I have ever tasted!  It was a rave success with my family and gone in a single sitting.  My husband is one of the toughest critics and even he loved them.  I followed the recipe as directed.

I'm not one to experiment but I was set on trying this recipe to complement the sausage flavored soup I made.  I didn't have biscuit mix, but I did have pancake and waffle mix - so I used that.  Also, I had just thrown out my cupcake pans, so I used a small baking pan instead.  The result was absolutely delicious.  My family has enjoyed cornbread in the past, but gobbled this version up in just minutes and have asked that I make the exact same recipe again and often!

The best corn muffins I've had in a long time!  Reduced the calories and fat by using skim milk, reduced fat biscuit mix and egg beaters.  Didn't lose any of the taste!  Will definitely be added to my recipe collection.

I've made this recipe many times following it as written, and it always tastes great!  It's sweet, but that's sometimes the way I like it.  Tonight, however, I was out of baking mix, so this is what I did:  in place of mix, add 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 1/4 Tbs of baking powder, and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I also for the first time used only 6 Tbs sugar.  It turned out great!  Not quite as light as the original (which some may find a plus) but definitely a keeper.  My kids eat 2 each (they're 5 and 2 years old) and usually there's a couple leftover, but they get eaten by the next morning!

This recipe was WAY too sweet.  After reading the other reviews, I cut back the sugar by 2 tablespoons.  It was still too sweet.  Also, I have never heard of putting vanilla in corn muffins; much less a whole tablespoon.  These tasted more like cupcakes than muffins.

To reduce calories, I used a somehow modified recipe: 2.5 tbs sugar, 2.5 tbs Splenda, 1/8 cup butter, 1/8 cup vegetable oil, and as other suggested, 1 1/4 bisque mix and 1/2 cup corn meal.  I am very happy with the modifications: 4 star.

Excellent recipe, thanks so much!  The best comment was "these look & taste professional"!!  I did change as suggested by other reviewers to less sugar, less mix and more corn meal.  Delicious served with Chef Johns Black bean soup, which is THE BEST!!

Love these muffins!! I like that it is NOT cornbread, which tends to be to dry for me.  I love the fluffy cake like texture and corn taste.  For my family this is a keeper for sure.

With modifications, this is the best corn bread I've ever had. I modified as per another reviewer: decrease sugar to 5 tbsp, decrease vanilla to 1/2 tsp, decrease bisquick to 1 1/4 cup and increase cornmeal to 1/2 cup. I also added a can of drained corn. With how sweet this was with the decrease of sugar, i can only imagine what 9 TB would have tasted like! Modified as above, Five Star Corn Bread!

I followed bcrocker's suggestions and thought the muffins were good.  They seemed to taste 
a bit like cake.

These are good but quite crumbly. I substituted butter-flavoured margarine for the butter, reduced the sugar to 4 TBsps. and omitted the vanilla extract. I used roughly 1/3 cup of cornmeal, but cannot be certain on the amount as I simply dumped whatever little bit was left in the bag into this; to compensate however I reduced the baking mix to 1 1/4 cups. I made mini muffins and baked for 15 minutes. I forgot to grease my pan and the bottoms stuck- No matter, we'll still eat them broken and all.

I followed other reviewers' advice and used 5 tablespoons of sugar, 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla. Also used 1 1/4 c of bisquick and 1/2 cup of cornmeal.
The taste was absolutely perfect, however mine came out extremely heavy. I filled the cups 2/3 full with batter and it never rose. Not sure what I did wrong, I did make sure not to over-stir the batter when adding in the cornmeal & bisquick. Any other suggestions?

Just made these... the texture and flavor were good. Added more cornmeal and cut back a little on the bisquick and used 5T of brown sugar instead of the 9T of white sugar.

YEA!!! I used GLUTEN FREE Bisquick (1 1/4 cup) with 1/2 cup corn meal based on other reviews, 5 tblsp sugar and 1/2 tblsp vanilla...and they are GREAT!. Thank you for posting this! My daughter is gluten free and any time we can make a dinner roll/biscuit that tastes gluten full but is gluten free we are thrilled!

These were very sweet and cakey. The kids loved them. I did decrease the sugar to 7 Tbs and increased the corn meal to 1/2 cup with a decrease in the baking mix by 1/4 cup but they were still not enough like corn bread for me. Will likely make again just because the kids liked them and they are easy. May tweak some more,though. Thanks!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing.  This is a really good recipe if you like your muffins on the sweet side.  I suppose you could cut down on the sugar if needed.I also never thought to use biscuit mix, but it worked wonderfully. The batter fit into 3 smaller loaf pans, since I was too pressed on time to make muffins. Will definitely keep recipe and make again. Thanks.

I've been struggling to find a cornmeal in this side of the world. My sister suggested to use corn flakes instead. So I powdered it, but wasn't able to make it fine.  I used 1 cup of that powdered corn flakes + 1 cup of baking mix.  I used less sugar (3 Tbsp of brown sugar and 2 Tbsp of white sugar).  This turned out really really great, with a bit of the crunch of corn flakes. I put a cream cheese toppings on some of them. Love this one! Thanks.

This is a keeper. My family enjoys them.  Very easy to make. I use cupcake liners for easy cleanup but of course you don't have to.  These are lighter in texture than what I am use to (which is great).  Vanilla makes them awesome.  Don't take the vanilla out like other reviewers have stated until you tried it first please.  We have these with our dinner atleast once a week.  Great recipe!!! :0)

These were pretty good. They were a little too sugary for me and my husband, but not my 2 year old. I added extra corn meal to the batter to get more of that corn muffin taste.

My attempt resulted in a dryer muffin.  Otherwise the taste was okay and not too sweet as others have mentioned.  May modify the cooking time next try.

Very good recipe, Kelly!  I altered it a little.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of cornmeal to make it have more corn taste and used 3/4 cup of milk instead of 2/3.  I wouldn't change the amount of vanilla or sugar.  Next time I will make it exactly how it's supposed to be made.  And believe me, there will be a next time!!

Really great muffins, but not dense like cornbread. Reminded me more of yellow cake than cornbread, but they tasted wonderful and were very light and fluffy.

This recipe is awesome! I'm devouring one of these muffins right now. I heeded some of the other posters' advice and cut the sugar to 6T (actually, I used Splenda) and I used about half a tablespoon of vanilla instead of the full tablespoon. I knew I would like them because I love sweets, but my husband doesn't. I couldn't stop him from eating these last night! He inhaled them. They went great with the spicy stew we were eating for dinner. This recipe beats the heck out of Jiffy.

I make these every year with my kindergarten class.  The recipe is simple and easy for children to do.  The kids really like the sweetness and "cupcake-like" texture of the muffins. All of the kids wanted to take home a copy of the recipe!

First time reviewing.  Made this for a tail gate party at West Point...must have given the recipe out a dozen times.  I put in a can of corn (drained) and a little tabasco sauce for a kick.

What great corn muffins!  I used Shedd's spread (country crock) and splenda to cut some calories and they tasted fabulous!  I served them with Chili to a group of friends and everyone raved about the corn muffins!  They were incredibly good!

Even people who don't like cornbread like this! It's kind of cakey and sweet. I made two batches, cooked in 8x8 pans for 40 minutes. People inhaled it. It's not a hearty cornbread, though, it's more sweet and delicate.

I DO NOT USUALLY GIVE 5 STARS, BUT THESE WERE EXCELLENT! JUST MADE CHILI,& WAS HUNTING FOR A GOOD CORN BREAD/MUFFIN RECIPE.I TRIED THE CEREAL COMPANY THAT MAKES THE CORNMEAL,MAKING AN 8X8 SIZE CORNBREAD. ALTHOUGH IT RAISED VERY NICELY & WAS VERY DENSE, IT WASN'T SWEET. I, LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS, REMEMBER CORN MUFFINS BEING SWEET, THE FLAVOR OFFSETTING THE SPICY CHILI. THANKS TO YOU KELLY, THE SEARCH HAS ENDED! SWEET, BUT NOT OVERLY SWEET---VERY EASY TO MAKE---THIS IS A KEEPER! I GOT 11 SM. MUFFINS----DID ANYBODY TRY AN 8X8 PAN? THANKS AGAIN KELLY!

Awesome!  I was looking for a recipe similar to Cracker Barrell's corn muffins and these were pretty close.  I only had white corn but they still turned out great!  Thanks for sharing.

We really liked these corn muffins. I made them in a 8x8 pan instead of doing muffins. My husband, who hates corn bread, even ate it up.

I would never call this corn bread.  More like " cake with a twist ". Good but just not corn bread.  corn bread is  1 cup s.r. white corn meal ( NOT CORN MEAL MIX ) 3/4 cup S.R. flour 1/4 c. oil 1 egg 1 teaspoon sugar buttermilk to make batter a little thicker than cake batter. beat well. bake as muffins or in  10 in.heavy skillet or cake pan  400 deg. till browned about 20 25 min. Thats my moms southern bread and I don't measure so the oil may need adjusting a bit. I am 82 so its an old pan pf bread.  Also a quickie for you  Pour 1 cup s.r. corn meal into 1 cup boiling water stir quick tii all mix well. Cool a little to handle and make patties as thin as you can and quick fry.  yummmy

Definitely more cake than cornbread, but served with Peanut soup, it was a good pairing to offset the spiciness of the soup.

Good, but definitely cake-ish.  Followed the recipe exactly and had a hard time tasting the "corn" part.  Daughter loved them, probably because they were so sweet!  If I want to do a true cornbread recipe, I'd try a different one.  However, they are still tasty.

I didn't like these very much.  They did not taste much like cornbread.  I followed the recipe exactly because I like to give it a chance without making changes the first time around.  I don't think I'll make these again.

Yes, they're sweet... But these muffins are delicious! I followed the original recipe as is, and next time I will use 1/2 cup cornmeal as other reviewers had said. Other than that, the recipe is great. If you are in the south, these will not be your typical corn muffin! This is a northern-tasting recipe, the land of sweet cornbread. 
I used white cornmeal and they still turned out golden yellow (probably because of the eggs and butter), so if white cornmeal is all you have, no worries, you'll still get golden corn muffins.
Cheers!

I will definitely make these again.  I served these with chili so I didn't want them to be all that sweet.  I reduced the sugar from 9T to only 3T and I omitted the vanilla.  I used gluten free baking mix.  These were fantastic gluten free, slightly sweet corn bread muffins.  I used muffin cups because everyone said they stick.  They even stuck to the paper a little.  I'd definitely use the muffin cups!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I greased the (non-stick) muffin tins but they still stuck in the bottom.  What I managed to get out of the pan was delicious, though.  Next time I will use liners to avoid the problem.  The recipe was easy and my toddler LOVED them.  They are sweeter and fluffier than what I had expected.  I will definitely use this recipe again (I am already getting requests from my son).

My husband and I really enjoyed these muffins. I've been looking for a good Corn Bread recipe, and I've found it! There is too much sugar, which I'll be experiementing with. They taste more like a cupcake than a muffin. I'll be making these again for sure, but I'll cut down on the sugar.

Very, very simple to make.  However, it tasted more like a basic muffin rather than a corn muffin.  If you want a quick and easy muffin recipe, this is the one!  Taste really good.

Followed the recipe exactly. The muffins tasted pretty good; sugar and vanilla extract were not overpowering in the flavour of the muffins at all. However, being CORN muffins the corn flavour was almost non-existant. Will prolly add more cornmeal and some corn kernels next time round.

Fantastic! I decided to try and replace the sugar w/ splenda and I was completely shocked when they came out delicious! I also decided to half the recipe for six servings and they made six medium/small muffins. Wonderful and easy recipe, I will definitely make it again!

Very good recipe if you are looking for a sweeter flavored muffin.  I really liked the taste the vanilla extract gave it as well.  I used buttermilk flavored cornmeal, instead of yellow as it states and it turned out excellent.  I was looking for a sweeter type bread to have with a savory roast - so this really was a perfect compliment!!!

I used 1/3 of a cup of cornmeal like another user had suggested.  I left out the vanilla by accident, but I think that next time I will try adding 1 tsp of it like other users suggested.  Overall, a pretty good recipe.

This is the best corn muffin recipe I have found so far. This one will be a keeper. I also cut back the sugar to 6 T and the vanilla to 1 tsp. Very Good. Thanks for sharing this good recipe

Lovely cake-like texture. I like these a lot, but next time I won't add so much vanilla. Cut back on the sugar if you don't like very sweet corn bread.

i have to agree with some of the other posts - skip the vanilla.  a little too much "desserty" flavor for something i was using as a side item to chili.  other than that though, these were great and easy!

Good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I dialed back the sugar and vanilla extract and that helped for my second batch.  I also thought it would be a bit more like corn bread, but this recipe isn't as course as true corn bread.  Doesn't make it bad, just different.

Great recipe!  I served them with citrus marinated chicken kebobs with sweet red and yellow peppers and grape tomatoes alongside a green salad.  The sweetness of the muffins was a perfect compliment.

This is a very good corn muffin recipe. I did make a few changes though.I cut back on the sugar(6 tbsp)and added more cornmeal(1/3 cup). It is so easy to make that I make it all the time using large 6 cup muffin tin instead of 12 cup. Thanks for the recipe

YUMMY!  I rarely eat corn muffins but made some for my husband to enjoy with his chili. To say the least, we gobbled them up.  Even my 10 month old couldn't get enough of them.

I've been looking for a good corn muffin recipe for a while now, and they always seem to turn out dry and bland.  These were completely oposite!  Moist and delicious; they were sweet, but not too sweet.  THE perfect recipe!  I will be making these again and again.

Very good. More cake-like than corn 'breads' that I have made before;not as 'grainy' and sweeter.
Sometimes I will choose this recipe, sometimes the more traditional; they are both good ,just different.

These are very tasty, but not what I think of when I think of corn muffins.  They are very sweet and cake like.  I charged into making these and already had the butter and the sugar in the mixer when I realized this wasn't going to be the usual corn muffin. I backed way off on the Vanilla because I thought it was a typo, one TABLEspoon? I put in a teaspoon but otherwise it was as written.  My kids loved these.  I liked them too, just not really a corn muffin.

I just cut back on the sugar, reduced the bisquick mix to one cup and add 3/4 cup cornmeal.  Husband loved it! Not too sweet and went well with a hot bowl of beef stew! Good recipe.

My favorite sweet cornbread recipe.  It's moist, delicious, easy to make  & better than any boxed mix. I made it as written & it's very  good then I tried it with 1 + 1/4 cups of baking mix and 1/2 cup of cornmeal but kept everything else the same & I like it even better.  You can use less sugar if preferred (I've tried that too) but no matter what it still comes out great.  Instead of baking it in a muffin pan, I bake it a lightly buttered 10 inch ceramic pie plate for 25 to 30 minutes then cut it into serving size pieces. YUMMY. Thanks for sharing. I'll never use a boxed mix again.

Looooved this one. I adjusted the corn meal/flour ratio to suit our “cornier” tastes, used a cast iron corn on cob muffin pan. Turned out so moist, crispy and the perfect texture inside. It’ll be my permanent corn muffin recipe

Way too sweet to be eaten with meal..very good as a dessert.  Would cut way back on sugar and vanilla and add more corn meal and less Bisquick. The muffins had more of a cake like taste and my guests said they were good and tasted like they just needed frosting to make them a good dessert.

I cannot believe how good these are. I followed others suggestions by decreasing the Bisquick to 1 1/4 c. and upping the corn meal to 1/2 c.  I also adding about 1/2 c. of canned corn after putting it in a blender with the milk. I baked 12 muffins for 23 minutes.  Perfect. I usually try to make healthier muffins, but these are worth all the sugar! Mmmm!

I've made these about 15 times now and they are always great. The only adjustment I make is on the sugar and that is depending on who is eating as to how sweet they like them. The normal amount of sugar I use is 6 tbls. This is my all time every time go to recipe for corn muffins!! Thanks for the great recipe!????

I've been using this recipe for the last 4 thanksgivings at the request of my family.  I tried using the lower calorie/sugar version ONCE at the dismay of my family--now they won't allow me to use any other recipe but this one.  I'm not the best baker but you can't go wrong with this easy recipe.  Thank you for sharing this with us!

After reading the reviews I decided to try it exactly the way it was written, although I do believe there was a typo in the listing for the amount of vanilla.  But it called for one tablespoon so I put in one tablespoon.  Almost inedible.  And way too sweet.  The texture was really good and the muffins were light and delicious except as noted.  Next time, and I will make them again, I'll cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon.

I also had to make the adjustments suggested for the bisquick mix and sugar and vanilla... Thanks to those adjustments these turned out moist and delicious!! I also had to adjust the cooking time to 15 at 350 since my oven seems to be a bit stronger then other ovens I have cooked in before. Would DEF make these again and have already passed on the recipe to other family members. Also, don't let the batter sit out for any period of time as the cornmeal starts to thicken up fairly quickly once mixed with the wet ingredients. Found these to be a bit gritty but my sister says that real corn muffins are gritty so I guess this is normal. They were still very good and I highly suggest this recipe!

These were very delicious! I sprinkled a little bit of sugar on top as well because I think that's what a restaurant we went to did- other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. It was wonderful! They almost made my main meal look sub-par. I was totally happy just eating corn muffins and never eating the main dish, lol. I got 14 muffins out of the recipe. The only thing that made me give 4 stars instead of 5 was that I wished they would have been more moist.

I LOVE these corn muffins!  My dad grew up on dry cornbread so he isn't a fan of these but as I was never a fan of dry, sometimes not even cooked all the way through cornbread, I was instantly hooked!  Best ever for sure!

These are awesome! They bake nice and golden brown they are soft and not crumbly and sweet! I suppose you could decrease the sugar amount, but I like this recipe just the way it is. They are great with warm butter, honey or homemade strawberry jam. FIVE STARS!

My husband and I love these, however they are a bit sweet for a dinner bread.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar and increase the cornmeal to make them work a bit better with dinner.

The texture was good and the taste was too cake like but it was edible. I like every one else will tweak this recipe to make it taste more like CORN muffins. One T. of vanilla did astound me - needless to say that will be cut down to 1/2t. instead and the butter and cornmeal will increase.

I followed other's advice: 1/2 c. cornmeal, 1 1/4 c. baking mix, 5 T. sugar & 1 teaspoon of vanilla. The vanilla made these muffins taste weird - they really should be called "Corn Cupcakes" - not bad tasting, just not what I wanted to serve with chili! (Side note: the recipe does make 12 muffins)

I give this recipe 5 stars only because truth be told, these are in fact muffins. They were sweet and cake-like. However, if you are looking for a "Cracker Barrell" style muffin - this is not the recipe to try!

Used 1/2 cup of cornmeal instead of 1/4.  Made 6 large muffins and 12 mini muffins. Thought they were excellent. Wish I had thought to add some whole kernal corn. Using to serve with stew.
Yummy though,I will make again and again.

This really is the best ever recipe for corn muffins!  I made it in a cake pan and it still turned out fabulous.  Really rich, moist and cake-like.  I "frosted" it with honey butter which made it all the more delicious.

I make these instead of plain cornbread all of the time.  The muffins are sweet like jiffy mix but homemade. You can also adjust the amount of cornmeal or flour slightly to get more taste of one or the other. Very tasty and great texture too!

I was not impressed at all with this recipe.  the muffins came out heavy, dry,and didn't taste much like corn.  they also could have used more sugar.  buy the honey cornbread mix from target (archer farms)  it's easier and tastes a whole lot better!

I am eating a piece of this right now, and I feel like I'm eating cake.  I baked it in a small pan instead of making muffins.  Anyhoo, this is a great recipe, but next time I will decrease the bisquick, add more corn meal, and a little less sugar.  I bet when my husband gets home he will tell me not to change a thing though!

This was a great recipe!  I can't have sugar so I replaced sugar with 6 Tablespoons of Splenda.  I also cut back on baking mix and increased corn meal.  Loved it!!!!!

SO GOOD!  My husband usually needs to add syrup to his corn bread and he was very impressed that he didn't need too!  They are sweet, (which we love!), but not heavy and dense like most cornbread!  My kids ate them too!  I would rate this a 10 if I could!  Thank you!

Excellent recipe! Very easy and just with basic ingredients.  Good buttery taste, moist too. I overcooked mine a bit but were still good. Will definitely make again.

This was a good recipe, but too sweet and not enough corn meal for me. I also would rather not taste vanilla in my corn muffins. The texture and ease were great. I sprayed my muffin tins and they came out beautifully. Check them early, mine were definetely done by 20 minutes.

These are deliciously sweet just the way my husband likes them. Mine did stick to my Pampered Chef muffin tray even though I sprayed a little Pam on it. I too, like the last reviewer, will use tins next time. Stii deserves 5 stars!

Tasted great, but they stuck to the pan, even after spraying it.  I would definitely recommend using muffin liners with this recipe.

So good! Now this is a very sweet recipe. Everyone thought I was serving cupcakes. If you don't like your cornbread sweet then this one is not for you. We all loved it, though.

Was really good.  Since I didn't have any biscuit baking mix, I followed BABYDANE's advise about using 1 1/2 cups flour but only put 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt and reduced the sugar to 7 Tbs.  Mine was done in about 15 minutes.

Very pleased with the results I got from this recipe. I was looking for a corn muffin that had a light texture, sweet taste, and was easy to prepare--this recipe hit the spot! I reduced sugar to 5 tablespoons and added only half the vanilla. Nice alternative if you like Jiffy mix corn muffins.

I was not at all impressed with this corn muffin recipe.  It was more like a cupcake than a corn muffin!  Too sweet and too much vanilla flavoring, and not at all like a corn muffin. Sorry.

These were very good.  I grew up with unsweetened cornbread, so these were a nice change of pace.  I used the recipe as is and they turned out great.  The leftovers I stored in a ziploc bac and the next morning I cut the muffins in half and toasted the cut sides under the broiler of a toaster oven and then buttered them.  Wonderful!

I give this recipe 5 stars even though i made it with the wrong ingredients. I live in europe and mistook cream of wheat for corn meal. Made the best ever muffins! Sweet and moist! I will try this recipe with corn meal next time (after my cream of wheat or "semoule de blu" runs out!)
