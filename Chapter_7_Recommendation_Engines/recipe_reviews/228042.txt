Because we have lots of snow on the deck, we broiled this trout that was freshly caught and it turned out great.  Yumm!

I took a shortcut and did not refrigerate for the hour so my bad there.  Also, I had 3 trout to make and it did not seem as if the ingredient measurements adjusted properly as the spices/herbs did not make a paste so much as a thick syrup.  Too much lemon juice?  Therefore the sauce did not stay on the fish very well.  It was still tasty (it's trout for goodness sake!) but really could not taste the flavoring that much.  So, may give this one another try as I think most of the problem was user error.  :-)

I gave it a try but I really thought it would be too spicy tasting and take away from the flavor of the trout. It didn't at all. This was a great new way to cook trout as my wife and I like fresh fresh, river trout.
