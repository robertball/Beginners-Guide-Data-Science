YUM!!  I used an entire turnip, and omitted the corn.  Instead I used a large bunch of fresh spinach and 2 potatoes.  I also put in some diced jalepeno for more spiciness. It was so healthful and yummy.  I can't wait to make it again with different veggies.  This is such a great recipe, thanks! :)

This was everything I hoped it would be. I doubled the recipe, soaked dry chick peas overnight, drained them, and cooked everything in the slow cooker with 3 cups of water added -- I'd suggest a cooking time of 6 hours if you try it this way.  I've got another bag of dry chick peas in the pantry, and I know what I'll be making with it. Might add some potatoes and/or lentils next time, too.

Very simple and delicious.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes in place of sauce.  I also doubled the veggies.  My first time cooking turnips and this recipe will be made again soon.

I had lots of leftover Turnips from my winter crop so gave this a shot. I used a whole red bell bepper and turnip and well as WAY increased the spiciness factor. It was pretty good.

I made this recipe several says ago with some added celery and carrots and my wife hasn't stopped raving about it yet!

I enlarged the recipe to 16 servings so that I would have some to dry for later. After having eaten from it twice, I stirred in the remaining basmati rice and popped it into the drier. It dried up "crunchy dry" in about 12 hours. I'm looking forward to eating this while backpacking, as well as storing a couple quarts for home use.

My sister-in-law just brought some more monster-sized turnips. So I'm off to find other recipes, too!

Hearty and flavorful!  I substituted 2 small turnips (unpeeled) instead of half of one, a 15-oz can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes instead of 1/2 can of tomato sauce, and I added one medium-sized red potato, diced.  I ended up simmering for 3 hours, the last 20 minutes I simmered uncovered to help it thicken.  It is easy with a quick prep time, and lends itself to using all kinds of vegetables.

I doubled most of the recipe, leaving the cumin, curry and tomato sauce the same.  I'm glad I did, because the spices are quite strong!  This has good flavor, texture and color appeal!

LOVED this recipe. I did not have corn available, instead I added a sweet potato, vegetable broth, parsley, and spinach. After I sauteed the onion, I added the sweet potato before the other ingredients. I let them cook a few minutes, then added just a little of white wine vinegar, mixed, then about a tablespoon of water. I put the lid on and let them cook a few minutes more. Then I added the rest of the veggies and beans. When I added the sauce, I added the veggie broth. When the potatoes and turnips were almost done (I simmered at medium low) then I added the spinach and parsley. I served over brown rice. My husband thought it was a little too sweet, but I thought it was just right. He added some extra salt to his- I added extra parsley to mine!

Yum yum YUM! And easy too! I appreciate all the other reviews, and followed some of the suggestions.

The can of corn I had was a bit more than called for in the recipe, so I added all. I added a full red pepper instead of a half. I used a full turnip (small sized). I also added half of a shallot along with the half onion.

Since I added more vegetables than the original recipe called for, I used a full can of tomato sauce (just shy of double what the original recipe suggests).

An hour and 45 minutes later, I'm in vegetable curry heaven! Fantastic recipe!!!

Love quick, healthy recipes like this -- I just improvise with whatever veggies I have on hand (though zucchini and bell peppers are especially in this..)

I've made this numerous times and it's always absolutely delish.  I've found that the recipe itself is very adaptable.  Today, for example, I had a lot of veggies from my CSA box (my daughter and her husband are organic farmers in Lake County, IL), so I just "went for it" and added veggies not mentioned in the recipe, e.g., carrots, Swiss chard, even a parsnip!  Since I was making a larger batch than the recipe described, I added a large (28 oz.) can of crushed organic tomatoes and a 1/4 cup of filtered water.  Perhaps most importantly, I added an extra teaspoon of cumin and also one of turmeric.  (You can also just add more curry powder, to taste basically.)  This is a great recipe and just cries out for adaptation.  Use the veggies you have on hand and the spices and low, slow simmer will take care of the rest.  Btw, I serve it over brown rice.  Better than any Indian restaurant!!!

OK, I brought the spices way down- to taste and added fresh tomatoes with the garlic. In addition, I added agave nectar and carrots. Both sugar and carrots are natural pair with the spices here. I did not add so much agave that it tasted sweet, only enough to pull together and soften the flavors. I did also add shaved almonds. With these additions I think this is a nice recipe. I am also certain adding a pinch of cinnamon to this dish would really add depth and color to it's flavor, but I am not one for cinnamon in my food. By the way, I used two small turnips rather than half of a large.
For a non-veg alternative I seered some chicken tenderloins on both sides before starting with the recipe- just let the tenderloins go along for the ride in the pan!

I thought it was an excellent vegetarian recipe that even my family liked who are not so crazy about vegetarian food that much. The turnip was a nice surprise. I did use a whole turnip since I didn't what else to use the other half for.

I made some changes, most notably using potatoes instead of turnips and reducing the amount of curry powder used.  I have a spicy curry powder, so only used 1 T.  I did drain the chickpeas, and rinse, because I don't like the taste of the liquid.  I added water to the recipe, but it still burned to the bottom of the pan a bit.  I added a half cup of light coconut milk at the end, which I thought really added to the richness of the recipe.  I served it over quinoa...the flavor ended up being lovely, but I wish it had been a little more liquidy.  If I make it again, I'll adjust it further.

Great vegetarian dish.  I omitted the cumin (don't really care for it) and used Garam Masala instead.  And I used rutabaga instead of turnip and crushed fire-roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because that's what I had on hand.  I also added the whole onion and pepper (red Diablo from my garden).  I didn't use the red pepper flakes but added a generous dose of cayenne which was perfect.  I also added chopped kale for the last half or so of cooking time.  I will definitely make again, but I'm thinking about roasting the veggies first to caramelize them a bit (still leaving them firm) and then proceeding.  This dish has endless possibilities!

Delicious & easy recipe. I added a lot more veggies because I had them on hand and wanted to get an additional meal or two out of this dish. 

I followed the directions, but also added a potato, a zucchini, a yellow bell pepper, two jalapenos, and spinach. Really yummy!

I made this for dinner tonight. I didn't have turnips on hand so I didn't add those. I added carrots. I used tomato sauce as in the recipe list and I think this is important to get the right consistency rather than those who have suggested using diced tomatoes. I served with jasmine rice.  It was delicious!

Good recipe, very simple, and satisfying.  Had fresh turnips, and dried chickpeas, so made a few modifications.  QUick cooked about 4 c. dried chickpeas (boiled for ten minutes, let soak for a few hours, then drain and proceeded with recipe).  Used one whole large turnip, a whole onion, omitted red pepper flakes as serving to children.  Added about 3 cups of water.Towards the end, threw a chopped unpeeled zucchini in.  Would like it with more corn next time.

This was delicious! I served it with rice, and it was a filling and satisfying meal. I was generous with the red pepper flakes, and it had a lovely heat. The balance of the spices with the tomato sauce and turnip was perfect. I would omit the corn in the future, but that is just because I am not a big corn fan. Thank you mia_bella84!!

This was absolutely wonderful. Doubled recipe and glad I did because now we have some leftovers for another dinner. Used a bag of frozen diced turnips (rutabagas), a bag of frozen corn, a can of tomato sauce, and 2 cans of rinsed garbanzos, along with double of everything else. Cooked as directed. Really easy and sooo yummy. Husband and I loved it. Will make again.

Great flavor! I added about 1 1/2 Tbsp grated fresh ginger and I cooked everything in the slow cooker (low setting 9 hours) adding  1 cup water. Served with basmati rice and Moroccan Lamb Kabobs. Very filling and delicious!

Didn't have any turnips (and not a big fan), so I used a whole red pepper and spinach instead. Turned out very nicely! Also used basil tomato sauce since I was out of plain sauce.

Doubled the recipe, but tripled the turnips and garlic. Even added some parsnips. Delicious over brown rice! Next time I'll add more turnips (trying to like them since they're so abundant in the garden!) This recipe would be great with any combination of root vegetables!

I was surprised how much I liked this and that everyone ate it. I used a little more tomato sauce and cumin and scraped a tiny bit of ginger in as well. Left out the corn. Also, I used half a turnip and a tiny russet potato cause my family had never had turnip before and were a little wary. Next time will try with only turnip cause no one could tell the difference. Thanks!

I don't like curry...so I left it out and added Tony Chachere's instead. I used three turnips and canned beans and corn. I used petite tomatoes instead of sauce. Lots of garlic and cumin. Very happy :) Very versatile and easy.

I have made this a couple of times.  A great healthy crockpot dinner.  I used 1 cup of dry chickpeas that I soaked overnight before using, and added one cup of water to the recipe.  I also replaced the tomato sauce with 1 can of crushed tomatoes.

Like it a lot.  I usually double the recipe so that there is  not half cans of stuff left over.  Very filling for someone who does not usually like meatless dishes.  Also it is super easy to use frozen corn and to reduce the cooking time.

So, no curry... I used turmeric and substituted adobo for the pinch of salt. I also added Beyond Meat sausages. They fool my youngest son who wants meat with every meal, though everyone else in the house can do vegan or veggie meals. It was delicious!

I used my Instant Pot, Saute the veggies to give more flavor then pressurized it for 10 minutes, then cool down, veggies came out perfect and not mushy. I followed the recipe, but I added a good tablespoon of curry paste  that I had in the fridge. As my Mom can't eat spicy food, I could only season it mildly, I will make this again just more spicy for the rest of us. 
PS: My (newly)vegetarian 23 year old son jumped at the offering of taking a container home! :)

Big hit at my house.  No changes to the recipe, just doubled it for big portions.  It was easy and inexpensive.  Served it the first time over rice.  The second time served with pita bread.  I'm no vegan, but I'll be making (and eating) this a lot!

Excellent dish.  I would only do 1.5 tbsp of curry next time instead of 2.  Liked the way it made the whole smell while it was simmering.

This is delicious. In fact I'm making it again this week.  I looked at the recipe and figured the key ingredients were the chickpeas and the turnips. As I had one zuchinni and no corn or red pepper I just used it and the meal was delicious. As someone else said I used coconut milk at the end for a silkiness that I like in my curries.  Thanks for the great base recipe.

After a good friend gave us some organic turnips from his daughter's garden, I was not sure how I was going to prepare them so my husband would  eat them.  After searching for ideas, this recipe came up.  It had many of my favorite ingredients and the curry/cumin spices did the trick.  My husband actually did not mind the turnips at all when presented in this recipe.  It was easy, delicious, and I'll definitely make again.

Delicious! I made two versions, one as written with the exception of doubling the amount of turnips, but then I made a version using chicken for my husband, instead of chickpeas. Both were quite good. My children all enjoyed the dish too; their first Indian flavored dish!

I am a beginner cook so am looking for simple recipes I can handle without taking too long. This recipe fit the bill! I did make a small change - instead of "curry powder" I used half turmeric and half garam masala. I was surprised by how spicy it became, I think next time I will add some sweet potato to tone it down a little. Nonetheless, this would be a great side veggie dish as is.

There was a lot that I didn't like about this dish. I served it on a bed of rice. For my family and I this was way too spicy. 2 tablespoons of curry was too much, plus black pepper, plus red pepper made it undesirable and I didn't finish my plate. Plus, the garbanzo beans didn't soften-up. they weren't hard, but they were too crunchy. A softer bean like Great Northern or Chili Beans would have been a better choice. If I made this again I'd only put in 1 teaspoon of curry powder and 1 teaspoon of cumin, taste and decide if I need pepper. I'd also use a different bean and I'd top it with cheddar cheese. 

I may re-experiment with this, but not for a while. Those who wish to make this should be mindful of the heat index.

I made it today and it was very easy to make. I had a package of chickpeas and left them in water during the night. Today I drained the chickpeas, added water, added all the spices, potatoes, green onion, and a tiny bit of  coconut oil and cooked everything in a pressure cooker for about 6 minutes.

This "stew" was amazing. I added celery to the vegetables and substituted the turnip with cauliflower. I also added cubed chicken early in the recipe to add protein. I misread the recipe and used tumeric instead of cumin, then worried that I had messed up dinner. Decided to serve it anyway, and it was delicious!  I highly recommend you try this easy weeknight meal. If you like curry, you won't be disappointed.

Very delicious and flavorful basic recipe! I doubled everything but the chickpeas and added more water for broth. Next time I'll add some coconut milk for extra richness. As is, a bit of Greek yogurt on top adds a lot!

Really, really yummy! However, cut the recipe in half, and thought it seemed a bit dry. Had to add a ton of water for desired results.

Great recipe - can use really any veggies that appeal to you.  A great way to use up those leftover veggies at the end of the week.  I may try throwing in some chicken next time as well.

Wow, so delicious.  Hearty and just enough spice to keep me wanting more!  I used 2 turnips and did not add the red pepper.  Fantastic! Thanks for the recipe.

I have used this recipe exactly the way it's listed and with all sorts of veggie substitutions. (radishes, kale, broccoli, carrots, potatoes to name a few) I love it. It's a great base and usually end up making it at least every two weeks to finish up the veggies from my csa box. Sometimes I add yogurt at the end, sometimes I don't. It usually doesn't take an hour to be ready if I've copped the veggies into bite size pieces but it does taste richer the next day.

I've wanted to try making a curry for awhile now and yesterday seemed a good day to go with it.  Snowy and cold, the day called for spicy comfort food.  This recipe was exactly what I needed. It was an excellent guide to help whip up a wonderful curry.  I did make several changes based on what I had on hand and personal taste.  The result was delicious.  I think curry is like so many widely loved dishes, such as chili, in that there are a zillion ways to adapt it.  Speaking of chili, I only like cumin in chili so I left it out and used coriander.  I agree with another review -- add the spices a little at a time so that it is the right amount for you.  I used about 1 1/2 TBS of curry powder and about 1 1/2 TBS of coriander. I didn't have a turnip.  I did use parsnips, carrots, and a small potato.  I also added a touch of agave syrup to bind the flavors as suggested in another review.  Don't you just love learning from new recipes AND the reviews?  Sadly, did not have a red pepper.  Left out the corn, but I think it's also a good idea.  Served it on jasmine rice.  We loved it.  Oh, I used  more tomato sauce and kept adding water because I wanted plenty of liquid.  Thank you, mia_bella, for helping me make my first curry!

A simple and easy dish to make if you have a little time on your hands.  The basmati rice was an almost must add for me.

Very tasty. A had a big turnip so automatically doubled the recipe. My only tip might be, don't go too crazy on the spice. Maybe do half of what's called for, taste, then add more if you like. Very spicy according to what's called for of the recipe itself. Still very good, can see myself making it again(with less curry powder), so for that 5 stars!

The small changes I made were mostly to try to bring down the heat some. A drizzle of maple syrup, 1/2 cup milk, cornstarch and 1/3 cup rich to soak up extra liquid. Took about an hour and a half for me.

Thank you! Great idea. We loved it even without the corn and served with rice. We will make it again...

Wonderful!  Doubled the recipe since we like leftovers.  Mostly made as directed, but decreased corn to one cup and added an extra turnip.  Lots of flavor, spice and heat!  Going into rotation.  I think this would be wonderful with the addition of chicken.  Thank you for the delicious recipe.

FABULOUS! I used items I had on hand so ended up using shallots instead of onions, and an assortment of red, yellow and orange peppers from my bag of mini peppers. I also like "kick" so I added extra crushed red pepper to suit my taste. I also had a pound of ground turkey that I needed to use, so I added that as well. Wasn't sure if I was going to like it, as this was my introduction to cooking with turnips. All I can say, is that it is so good, I can't stop eating it! This is going to become a regular dish at my house.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe except substituted green bell pepper for the red. My only regret is not doubling it because I wish I had more left for lunch tomorrow. Even my four year old liked it. :)

I am trying to limit the canned food used in my cooking and this recipe calls for a lot of canned food. The dish turned out all right, but next time I might avoid using canned tomato sauce and corns.

I was looking for a veg. recipe that used turnips and found this one.  Loved it!  I followed the recipe as written, with just the following adjustments: used a whole turnip and pepper (not half) and used half cup of corn and half cup of frozen peas (instead of a full cup of corn).  the seasonings in the recipe as written were perfect.  My dish was done after 60 mins simmer--the turnips were tender by then.  Will add this to my regular rotation.  Bonus, can serve to vegan friends.

I make a chicken curry with coconut milk all the time but wanted to try something different.  I made the vegetarian chickpea tonight and loved it.  I swapped zucchini for the bell pepper (just out of personal preference) and added some cayenne pepper for extra kick, but other than that, followed the recipe pretty closely.  It was a big hit with the fam.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe with 3 small turnips that came in my veggie delivery box.  I also had to use less spice because I realized at crush time, that I only had 1 tbsp. Of curry left.  I served this to my family and an out-of-state guest on his first night here.  My kids ate it up, and our guest said he didn't think he would have a better meal for the duration of his stay.  Very adaptable recipe, I will keep it and try other veggies as well.

My first time with currys as well as turnips. YUMMY!! This is a great recipe. I forgot to buy a bell pepper so I left t out. I prepared it with brown jasmine rice & sauteed green kale with onions ... flavors complimented eachother well.

this was an awesome dish, I used a can of tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and I used a whole turnip. I also added 2 tsp of curry paste. I would make this again
