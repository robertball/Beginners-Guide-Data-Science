this was the most excellent onion soup ever!!!!! I followed it to a T and it wasn't all that creamy but used unsalted butter and condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, added pepper but no salt. It was just so darn delicious, the onions were melting in my mouth they were so tender. I can say it wasn't that "creamy creamy" like I thought it would be but it was still excellent. So I added  a dollup of sour cream, which added the creaminess to the soup...All in all and excellent filling soup and wished I had thought about adding some portabella mushrooms to it. Thanks wmat, this is a total keeper.

This was so good and so easy. My husband loved it. It tastes just like french onion soup when you add some cheese and croutons. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was definitely easy to make and quick. It turned out very good and delicious. The only difference in mine was that I added some water, a bay leaf, and some carrots for variety. I also simmered a bit longer.

I thought the onion in this was way too overpowering. It smelled up the whole house and I had to throw it away. It was a big disappointment. I will stick with the classic french onion soup. For some reason the cream just didn't taste right with so many onions.
