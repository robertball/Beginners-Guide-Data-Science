AMAZING!!  Makes a LOT of sauce, and uses a lot of spices, but OMG it is so worth it.  My husband scarfed it up (so did I).  It has exactly the right amount of heat, just a little zip.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs - which I would highly recommend.  I used less butter, and had to sub sour cream for the plain yogurt, so it's tweakable - but the spice combination is heavenly.  I served it with white rice and steamed snow peas.

First: I'll make this again this weekend.

Second: apologies to the author, since I *thought* I followed the recipe to the letter.

Third: this week I will learn how to read, and NOT add 4T cayenne when it calls for much less!  I coulda killed a moose!!!

More later, since I really, really love curry.

If I don't kill myself in the kitchen.
