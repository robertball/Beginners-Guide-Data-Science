Fantastic! Great for camping too! Stuck them right by the hot coals. Took longer to cook but it was great!

I would leave out the celery and green onion. Less BBQ sauce.

Instead of frozen veggies I used the Steam fresh bag of wild rice mixed with veggies so you get the rice and veggies in one!

I did not add veggies only meat and sauce but it was very good. The pork was tender and delicious. The clean up was super easy. I will make this again.
