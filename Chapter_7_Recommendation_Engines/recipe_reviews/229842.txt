These brownies are very moist and have a good flavor.  I especially enjoyed the chocolate chips.  I didn't change a thing except to bake for a few extra minutes, and I used an 8x8 pan, because that's all I had.  I wouldn't use a larger pan unless you like really thin brownies.

My family loved these brownies!  They are so moist and tasty with a chewy texture.  Definitely a keeper. I doubled the recipe & used a 9x13 pan.

Perfect chewy brownies; quick and easy to make!  I made random cuts through them once I pulled them out of the oven, then poured melted dark chocolate in the cuts. Amazing! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent crumb with fudgey texture and a nice cracked top, oil brings the chew in this recipe. I used less sugar, Penzey's dutched cocoa, and cracked kosher salt lightly sprinkled on top. This is definately my new go-to for brownies, Thanks Egg farmers of Ontario and allrecipes.com!

I'd give this four and a half stars if I could.  We found them a bit rich and I'd cut back on the oil a little in future.  They definitely need the full cooking time of 30 minutes as they were still doughy at 25. The whole pan was gone by the end of the evening so they were a real hit with company!

I tried this recipe because it has oil instead of butter. It was too cakey for me. I personally recommend using just one egg. Also, without the chocolate chips, it is pretty blas√©. (I made one batch. Half of it had chips and half didn't.) In a pinch - meaning if I don't have butter - I might try it again.

We made a double batch, baked In a 9x13 pan, for about 30 minutes. Delicious. Thank you for this recipe. I am seriously considering never again buying a box mix. Yum!

Very soft cookies, used 17g extra chips, maybe it will be better when cooled completely or perhaps bake for 27 minutes.

Very good. Made me proud to make them from scratch. Very moist. I just wish I had chocolate chips to put on them like the recipe asked for.

Just finished another batch b/c the first post didn't last long. The only thing I say is make sure to double the recipe.

These are delicious. I have made them a few times and they never fail to impress. I am just about to take another pan out of the oven, half topped with bacon :)

I found this recipe because I was looking for one that used oil instead of butter.  Delish!  I doubled it and baked in an 8 x 11 glass pan because I like super-thick brownies, then baked for an extra 5 minutes. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I've made this recipe many times, and just realized I'd never left a review.  I usually change the serving size to 32 servings (I love this feature--change the servings and let Allrecipes do the math!) and use a 9"x13" pan.  I don't always add the chocolate chips, but I have used other flavor additions--mint extract/essential oil; instant coffee granules; or peanut butter chips.  This is an all-around great brownie recipe!  Thank you egg farmers, Steve and Marsha Shaw!

My 14yr old son made this, and it turned out great. We didn't use choc chips and it still was moist. Also cooked about 5 minutes longer. It was a easy recipe for him to do. It calmed my surgar  tooth down. LOL !!

I wish I had pulled these out of the oven at 25 minutes.  Toothpick didn't come out clean then, and at 30 minutes it did, but 30 minutes was too long.  I think they might have been perfect at 25.  My guests loved these brownies when they were fresh.  A day later a little microwaving helped soften them.  I had some toffee sprinkles that I sprinkled over the top of the brownies, and these were a big hit too.
