I have had a few kugels before and this was really not one of my favs. at all. It turned out pretty bland for my familys taste and the noodles on top were dry and crunchy, in a very unappealing way. recipes i have used and loved before used cream cheese and Kellogs Frosted Flakes for a delightful and tasty crunchy top.

I am the author of the recipe and I wanted to mention that if you do not want the noodles on top to come out crunchy, then you should cover your pan with tin foil before putting it in the oven.  You may want to adjust your baking time a little to ensure it doesn't overcook.  Some people love the crispy noodles. I do not, but my mother and brother always fought over who would get to eat them. :)

I have never had kugel before. I thought it was good. I only used half the amount of butter and next time would cut up apples to add to it because it didn't taste like apples at all and I think the apple flavor would be good. I also sprinkled a little rolled oats into the mixture when I ate a serving so it tastes more hearty.

I really liked this kugel recipe. I look forward to making it a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing is that I substituted sour cream for margarine/butter (seemed healthier/creamier that way) and I added apple pieces.

Thank you, Lisa, for a good recipe. I usually make a half recipe, unless we're having company, and it is always good. While the water comes to a boil and the noodles cook, I mix all the other ingredients together except for the butter and add that mixture to the noodles and butter. One time while making this, noodles cooking, I found I had half the needed  sugar (I know I had more sugar but the gremlins got it) so I used light brown sugar for the other half. It worked, but I don't think it was good enough to change the recipe. Another time I sent some home with my 90+ year old FIL, who called me the next day and told me before he reheated it he added some raisins and really enjoyed the leftovers. Quite a versatile recipe and very good as written.
