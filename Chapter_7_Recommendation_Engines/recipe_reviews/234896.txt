I followed the recipe exact only leaving out the avocado (I am sorry, I just do not like it). I did use BROWN rice and fresh lime juice. This salad was AMAZING. No leftovers, we ate every single bit of this salad.

Delicious!  I cut down on the oil and added black beans and it was still wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

This may be our favorite allrecipes dish yet.  It's quickly become our summer go to!  I'm usually able to make it with leftover rice and produce we just tend to have around the house, making the only "cooking" the chicken.  I throw 3 chicken breasts in the crock pot first thing in the morning, season them heavily with kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, cayenne, chili powder, red pepper flakes and paprika.  After 4 hours I put them in a bowl and just pull them apart with forks.  I also add a can of  rinsed black beans to the mix.  Serve it over butter lettuce which is often in abundance in folks backyards in summer.  We're big fans.  Great, easy, refreshing summer lunch!

Tried this recipe this past weekend.  I like the recipe because it is very nutritious for you.  However, it is a little on the bland side if you make the salad exactly by the recipe.  If I make the recipe again, I will add more salt and more lime juice to give it a little more kick.

Excellent summertime recipe! Made it following recipe with minor changes. Instead of using plain white rice, I used some leftover Mexican Rice I had on hand, which turned out great and gave it even more flavor. Due to personal preference, I cut back the amount of Jalapeno I used to only 1/3 the pepper and the Chili Powder to only 1/4 tsp, which was spicy enough for our palates. I also used half the amount of Cilantro recipe called for as I felt entire amount would've given it too strong of a flavor. Husband loved it and said this recipe's a keeper and I agree with him!
Update to review: we were only able to eat 1/2 the filling for one meal so I saved the other half to serve the next day. I found the lime juice in the dressing made it a bit sour after sitting a day so in making the dressing the next time I added about 1/2 Tbsp Honey that cut back on the sourness. Much better this way.

My husband and I loved this salad!  Since it is just the two of us we had it for two meals.  He (yes, I said he) reserved half the tomato, avocado and dressing for the second meal.  The dressing flavors infused and had a much better flavor the second round.  He added more cilantro than the recipe called for since the both of us like its so much.

I used brown rice, olive oil,  2 heaping Tablespoons Rotel original canned tomatoes with chili pepper instead of the jalepano in the dressing, added some chopped red pepper for color and black olives.  Also used lemon juice and zest instead of lime.  Served over "Power Greens" Otherwise followed recipe.  My husband and I definitely want this in the "regular" rotation. I can see using the dressing with whatever leftover meat and grain  and veggies are in the frig.

I followed the recipe but added grilled chicken and brown rice to make it even more healthy. The recipe was absolutely delicious. I will be making this for many years to come.

Somewhat bland, could use a kick of something. It was okay this hot summer evening but I doubt I'll repeat it for the all the work that went into it.

OMG, this was fabulous!  While grilling dinner the night before, I threw on two chicken breasts too.  I also made the rice the night before (brown rice) as well as combining the ingredients for the dressing.  In the morning, I put all of the ingredients together (except for the avocado) and poured the dressing on and let it sit all day while I was at work.  When I got home, I shredded some lettuce, diced the avocado and dinner was ready!  And boy was it delicious - very similar to Chipotle.  Leftovers today for lunch and they were just as good.  I did add a can of black beans and will probably reduce the amount of oil next time since I don't think it needs that much but other than that, I will make this often!  I'm thinking I will make a double batch of this on a Sunday and have delicious lunches for me and my husband during the work week.  Excellent and full of flavor!

My husband and I loved the flavour and will definitely add it our regular meals. Kids, not so much. They found the cilantro taste too strong so I will try cutting back in that next time.  Overall it is a delicious healthy dinner.

Good recipe. I added black bean and corn to my recipe and skipped the jalapeño.

Delicious! I seasoned and grilled a couple chicken breasts and added black beans. The dressing was incredible!  My daughter said it was better than Chipotle.
