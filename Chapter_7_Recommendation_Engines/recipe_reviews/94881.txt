Wow, I love this. 2 of my favs . . . hummus & bruschetta. When I started, I didn't realize that the hummus needed to be refrigerated overnight. I skipped that step. I also make garbanzos from dried beans. I toasted the bread with the parm for a bit, but I also wanted the hummus, cheese (I used mozz since I don't have any feta) and tomatoes toasted, so I took out the bread, put the mentioned ingredients (with the herbs) and finished toasting. Delish!

This is Amazing!  Believe it or not, I actually "invented" this recipe a few weeks ago when I happened to have a leftover ciabatta, some bruschetta salsa that a friend had canned and given to me (minus the feta) and my usual hummus that I always have on hand.  I was just Googling Hummus and Bruschetta to see if anyone else had ever thought to use them together.  In my mind, the cumin in the hummus together with the italian herbs in the bruschetta salsa might not be "considered" a good combo (even though I absolutely loved the result) Now that I know three other people here loved it, I can feel more confident about serving it to guests.  :)

I didn't totally follow the recipe because I had missing ingredients... but I used the general idea and it turned out fan-freakin-tastic:)

This is the BEST Bruschetta I have ever had. I love the hummus that goes with it, and not cooking the tomatoes.  I did not alter this recipe what so ever. We acually left the hummus covered bread plain, and you built your own as you wanted so that it would not get overly soggy. I sprinkled the garlic powder on, but left the tomatoes, cheese and oregano for you to add yourself. For a large crowd assembly would be just fine. It was only me and my mom.

My husband, his friend and I all loved this.  I felt that the hummus really added some extra substance to the bruschetta and the combination of flavors was phenomenal.  Maybe it's just my oven but by the time I checked on the toasting bread at 2.5 minutes, it was already burned on the edges.  Next time I'll check at 1.5 or 2 minutes.

Now, these were REALLY delicious! They are great as written, but I made a couple modifications on several of the bruschetta.     On some I used olive oil instead of butter when broiling.  Also, I whipped up some delicious guacamole  (Bob Cody's recipe on Allrecipies.com! ), and added this along with a couple green olives on top of the regular bruschetta recipe - and it was oh, so good!
