This was a hit!  I made some cream cheese icing for the top, used 3/4 cup molasses instead of 1 cup, and rolled them out to just a little bit thicker than the recommended 1/4 inch.  My friends loved them and they were so fun to make :) 

The recipes does have a type-o in it.  It calls for the use of baking soda in the ingredients and baking powder in the recipe.  It was a 50/50 chance and luckily I chose the correct one, which was BAKING SODA.

Molasses, gingersnap, and gingerbread recipes are all very close..,I've tried so many different ones trying to find that one with the perfect bite and chewiness and flavor, and for me, this is the one. I added 1Tb. orange rind to the batter and did my usual changes: used half whole wheat pastry flour and only half the sugar, and I won't get through this season without a constant supply on (or in) hand. I think the name keeps people from trying this recipe, too, because it doesn't come up on gingerbread searches. Well, as they say, seek and you shall find.

THE BEST. My 4 year old son has autism and is very, very picky -- he won't even eat chocolate chip cookies or cake.  Whenever I want to bake him a treat, I turn to these cookies, which he inhales. It's a bit time consuming, and you have to plan ahead a little, but the results are so yummy.  

I give these out at Christmas in shapes of trees and bears and moose. Will hold their shapes even if cut really large.  And the house smells wonderful afterwards!

WAY too much molasses for my taste. The dough was extremely sticky, as others have noted.  I probably added another whole CUP of flour as I was rolling out these cookies, just to be able to get them up off the counter. I think I will play around with this recipe, though, because I really liked the texture of the cookie--firm yet chewy. Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of molasses and substitute the other half with light corn syrup. I think I will also skip the cloves and add in cinnamon instead.  I may even think about adding more flour to the dough to cut down on the stickiness and help with rolling out. For now, this recipe only gets 2 stars, but I will try again.

Very nice molasses cookie, however not a Joe Frogger. Two Stars for effort. I knew it was "off the mark" when I saw the cut out cookies with a sugar frosting on top!!!! A recipe for Joe Froggers first appeared in print in Eleanor Early's cookbook, "New England Cookbook"published by Random House in 1954. Here is an excellent blog on making Joe Froggers, which gives some great background on the cookie and its history in Marblehead, Massachusetts. http://www.katyelliott.com/blog/2011/12/recipe-joe-froggers-cookies-from-marblehead.html
Eleanor Early's recipe calls for rolling the dough to 1/2" and cutting with a large round cookie cutter, suggesting a coffee can be used as such. Though named after Joseph Brown, a freed slave from Marblehead, the cookie is credited to his wife Lucretia Brown.

Make them as written, and make no substitutions and you will enjoy a true New England classic.

The flavor of these cookies was good. I could not roll them out/cut them out even after refrigerating overnight as the dough was too soft to do so. I ended up making balls, rolling in sugar and pressing flat w/ the bottom of a glass. That worked well, but all the cookies except the batch I accidently underbaked became rock hard.

These are cutout cookies that are real soft and squishy-like, so they might not work so good with ginger boys and girls. They are not overly sweet, so maybe a light frosting would be a good add on. These are real easy and make the house smell festive.

Not bad.  I was hoping for something with a little more crispness, and a little less bite.  I think a light layer of cream cheese frosting would really have helped.

We didn't attempt to roll these as cookie cutter cookies--the dough rolled out, but was much too sticky to lift & allow the cut-out to hold shape.  Instead I did them like Peanut Blossoms--made balls, rolled them in white sugar, and flattened on a pan with the bottom of a glass.  Great!  Yummy with frosting, too.

Just made these.. they are great.  I didn't even refrigerate them, just rolled into balls, put sugar on top and flattened with bottom of glass (as another reader suggested) right after I mixed them.  They will be added to my christmas cookie list!

Added 3/4 cup molasses as suggested which made it a perfect dough; would have been too sticky otherwise. Added about 1 teas cinnamon as well. Good flavor.

Don't do what we did: we subbed butter for shortening, made dough balls, rolled in sugar and cooked a bit too long--I couldn't get these off the cookie sheet!  The dough was delicious BEFORE adding the 1-1/2 tsp salt (seems like alot but we added what was called for--dough turned extremely salty). Our cookies came out of the oven and went into the trash which was unfortunate.  Glad to read others had good luck! (i'm rating *** b/c too much salt)

We loved these cookies. I was skeptical making them because gingerbread cookies don't usually get eaten in our house, the kids just like decorating them. But every last cookie was eaten with this recipe! I am glad I found it!

fabulous recipe - good flavour (a little bite, but not too much) and good consistency (firm and chewey, but not hard).  i found the cookies were not that difficult to roll out, as long as it was chilled enough and everything was well-floured.  i made gingerbread men, and with the scraps (which were too soft to re-roll and cut) i rolled them into balls and used a sugared glass to press them down.

Yummy!  To me, these tasted like a nice mild gingersnap-without being rock hard!  The dough was a bit sticky to work with, but nothing that a well floured surface couldn't handle.  I rolled these out and used cookie cutters, and they held their shape nicely.  My family really liked them, from hubby right down to 3 year old.  I did moisten them slightly and sprinkle colored sugar on before baking.  Oh, they cooked quickly, too, but maybe I rolled them a bit too thin.  I will definitely make these again for the holidays!

Maybe I did something wrong but these did not turn out very good.  They did not seem sweet enough or something.  Maybe it was the kind of molasses I used.

Not great for the really little kids, as they had to wait before dough was chilled enough to work with -- and even then, the texture couldn't stand up to their heavy-duty rolling and cutting procedures.  Wham!  It became a sticky mess pretty quickly.  If you like molasses, a pretty good flavor.  Ours were hard, not chewy -- but might be the fault of our technique, rather than the recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I was looking for a good vegan gingerbread cookie recipe for the holidays. I made a few changes based off of other reviews and they turned out great. I added 1/2 c. more flour, substituted coconut sugar for the white sugar and went heavier on my spices and added 1/4 tsp of black pepper and cardamom and a little zest from a lemon to add more dimension to the cookies. It's not a very sweet gingerbread cookie (which I personally love) so I let my daughter decorate some with icing. The dough was a little sticky/not very firm after sitting in the fridge overnight but rolling it between 2 sheets of parchment made it not stick. Also did 8 minutes for bake time.

Not everyone's taste buds are the same.  Having said that, these cookies must be an acquired taste because I made these and my entire family all thought that they tasted terrible.  Everyone said to toss them.

I left the dough to stiffen over the night but was still a wet mix in the morning, so cut-outs weren't possible, making it hard to put on the cookie sheet.

I'm not usually a fan of Molasses cookies, but this one is really tasty.  I think it would be a hit at any gathering!

This is a great recipe!  If you like soft, molasses cookies like grandma used to make, you will love this one.
