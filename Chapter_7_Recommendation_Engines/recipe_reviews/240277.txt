Take my recipe with a grain of salt because I made some big changes: Used Â½ tsp nutmeg instead of only a pinch in the batter, 1 C dried apples, 3.5 oz of caramels (guessing about 1/3 - 1/2 C), omitted nuts and topping. It was bland. Glad I added the nutmeg for at least some flavor. And glad I reduced the caramel because there was plenty at 3.5 oz. I C would have been way too much caramel.
