Really nice hash style recipe. Only thing I added was some spicy seasoning at the end. Do toast the hazlenuts..  there is a huge difference in thair flavor. Taste some untoasted and then toast some up... so much better toasted

I changed a few things... use apples instead of pears as that was all I had, used Jack Daniels instead of Irish Whiskey, walnuts instead of hazelnuts and used chicken boullion instead of just water. I also tripled the whiskey amount, as my husband and I both love the taste of whiskey and the dish was not overpoweringly whiskey tasting. It was perfect! Absolutely will make again, especially in the fall.

Made this tonight on a whim to use some sweet potatoes I had. I used some drumsticks instead just because I had them and it was great. 

 It was delicious! I would however make a few adjustments next time. I loved the pears and would add another. I would also double the spinach, since it cooks down so much. 

Other than that - fab!

My husband and I are about to endure a 30 day cut diet, so with a few modifications, this will be one of the recipes.  I toasted slivered almonds, used ground sage (about 1 tbsp); used three thinned chicken breasts and substituted one apple (which will likely fall out once the diet starts, though shouldn't alter the taste greatly).  Also, if you don't add some olive oil during the browning of the sweet potatoes, they will get destroyed.

I hate when people rate recipes after they've altered it, but I'm sure the original is just as good, if not better, than the version I made.  Based on what I had on hand, I used granny smith apples instead of pears, omitted the whiskey, and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts.  It was delicious!  Next time I will make it as written to see which version is better, but I'll leave the chicken out because I don't think it adds anything.

I didn't have spinach so added leeks and mushrooms instead. Very tasty! The pear and sage make a lovely difference

This is a really tasty fall recipe, and I will definitely be making it again.  Based upon what I know I like, I followed the directions, but with the following changes:  Lightly fry 1 hot Italian sausage patty in the pan first.  Remove the sausage, then use butter instead of olive oil to cook the chicken.  I did not 'brown' the chicken, as I didn't want to dry it out.  Remove the chicken, then add 1 small chopped onion and the sausage diced into small pieces to the sweet potatoes.  Use chicken broth instead of water.  When it was done, there was quite a bit of liquid in the bottom, so I stirred in a tablespoon of corn starch mixed with a little water, and brought back to a quick boil to thicken it.  The whole process was easy, and the results are wonderful... it's very much 'comfort food' on a cold day, and I bet the leftovers will be even better!

Tastes like a hash with sweet potatoes, rather mushy and spinachy...
Don't like sweet potato and spinach combo....just my opinion.
Nobody here ate it except the insinkerator....

Very good. The flavors work together. I doubled the recipe but only had one pear. It prbably would have been beter with two.

Good flavors, but I felt like it was missing some depth. I'll add more whiskey next time and maybe chicken stock instead of water. Wait on adding the pears until just before serving or they start to break down.

I doubled the recipe and used leftover cooked chicken. I even made sure to buy hazelnuts for this and toasted them which was very easy to do. This recipe was delicious and a good way of getting a lot of healthy items into my hubbys diet in one dish. Spinach cooked down so much that even more could be added without overpowering the taste of this lovely hash.

I added onions, garlic, more salt and pepper, and I used beet green and stems.  Added the stems with the sweet  potatoes as they need more time to soften.  The beet green will take a few minutes to soften.

We have another favourite apple & sweet potato meal (with garlic sausage) so I tried this, but it was not a hit. I ended up deconstructing the leftovers (there were a lot) to make apple sweet potato curry soup and use the chicken in another meal.

We liked this but found it a bit dry. And I think the sage I used had lost its savor, because it couldn't be tasted at all. Still, it was good enough that I'll be making it again, with new sage and a bit more liquid. Probably chicken stock.

Warm, feel good brunchy dish. Between the sage, hazelnuts and pear, it may have been a bit fragrant for my taste and perhaps a bit sweet for breakfast. Might sub pecans for all or part of hazelnuts and add onion. Will make again in the fall and try with some squash instead of sweet potato! Otherwise, for how it was written, I enjoyed the dish and will make it again with revisions!

Absolutely delicious!!! Unfortunately, I didn't plan ahead on this and had to make a few substitutions. I added onion, garlic and chicken stock ( instead of water). I had to substitute hazelnuts for pecans. I had no fruit or whiskey. I know it is almost a completely different recipe, but I wanted to share in cases someone needed ideas or substitutions!

I made this with some changes.
First of all i used a green apple instead of a pear, just because i didn't have a pear- still came out great.
I used about 1 cup of spinach, but next time i will add like 3 cups ... i love spinach and the more the merrier for all i care.
I used 1 tbsp whiskey as in the recipe, next time i will try with twice the amount. 
I used dry sage and i used about twice the amount- it wasn't overwhelming at all... that might be because i used the dry kind.
Came out great!
Very tasty and really felt like a healthy meal

Terrific concept. Our version was non-alcoholic, with better than bouillon, once it was pear, this time a fuji apple peeled and chopped, this time it's kale, i only had toasted almonds, and it was delicious! Delish and healthy with room for tweaking that was neccesary for us and what I had on hand. But like i said, loved the new concept! Oh and we also only had ground sage. I think that was a first time that i have ever used so much sage...but awesome!

Although I have been using Allrecipes for a long time, this is my first review! I made this recipe tonight, and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I substituted a few things because they are what I had on hand. I used butternut squash instead of a sweet potato, chicken stock instead of water, and a heaping teaspoon of dried sage instead of fresh. I will be making this again.

Kicking good, We made some adjustments simply because we didn't have what the recipe called for and it was great. My feeling is if it was this great with me messing it up it must be 5++++ doing by the recipe. We used Rosemary(always on potatoes) and at the end some tried it with a Thai Peanut sauce.... better without. No pear but I bet that kicks it up more. This is now in the rotation, Fall time I think we add some nutmeg and an apple!

I replaced the spinach with kale (all I had) and cut it into tiny pieces. It didn't effect it. I also used pre-cooked chicken meatballs (again, all I had) and my 16 year old daughter ate it and didn't complain. That's a plus! Thanks for the great recipe!
