Very good and easy to make. I was worried about the cayenne making this too spicy so I cut it in half - although I later found that by using mild chili = it covers it up pretty well and next time I may use the full amt. I used mild chili (one can w/ beans one can w/out making 30oz total). THIS MAKES ALOT!! My boyfriend came home for lunch and wondered who all I was cooking for:)!! Finally I added some cheese to melt over my serving but my boyfriend and daughter liked it as it was. NOTE: I think this could use an 8oz can of tomato sauce to ensure that this doesn't get dried out! Leftovers were pretty dry - some tom. sauce might remedy that but overall - a tasty & easy - great when your in a time crunch for lunch.

This recipe was simple and easy.  I used chili beans without the meat sauce.  It was still very, very good!  I also added salsa to it while cooking.  Nice and easy and delicious!  -Kathy

This was great - made it according to recipe - didn't change anything. It makes a LOT which for our family of 5 is great. I used Hot Hormel Chili with Beans. We kept leftovers covered and didn't think they were too dry but maybe I'll experiment next time!

Used chili without beans and left out corn because of fussy kids.   Easy and delicious.

Well, I ended up not having Chili with beans, so I added two cans of chili ready diced tomatoes and black beans. I used frozen corn instead of canned. I also added fresh garlic to the hamburger. It turned out good. It was still a bit dry, so I might add a can of tomato sauce to what is left. This makes a large batch, lots of leftovers.

I took others advice and added a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic to give it a little more sauce. I also added garlic and cilantro. I did not add the corn, but served it with corn bread. I only used 8 oz of pasta, 16 oz was just over the top. I also substituted frozen mixed peppers for the green pepper.  I really enjoyed this as an alternative to  regular old chili.

We thought too dry (and I even added 1/2 can tomato soup and 1 c. water). We only added 1 t. each of cayenne pepper and chili powder and a little spicy for us. We used chili w/ just beans. If using some w/ meat watch the meat portions because of adding the ground beef. Noone liked it enough to make again.

I scaled this down to three and we have enough for left overs. I omitted the salt and green pepper, added a 14 oz can tomato sauce, only put in 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and all chili powder and it is too spicy for us. I also used fresh freezer corn. Also used mini bow ties because I was out of wagon wheels. My hubby wanted to know if we had sour cream, but he likes everything creamy.

Pretty good recipe. I left the corn out and would probably only use a dash of cayenne pepper because I don't like spicy food (my sister said the same thing). There was SO much food - more than I expected so we had lots of leftovers. I sprinkled cheese on my food which made it taste great. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is missing something... can't quite figure out what that would be. Maybe some type of sauce would help or adding some grated cheese. It's bland even with the chili and spices. I added stewed tomatoes while cooking but that didn't help much. My husband felt the same way about this recipe. It's filling though and makes a lot. We will eat it leftover but I don't think I will make this again.

Good but a bit spicy. I d reduce the amount of cayenne next time. This would be great topped with some shredded cheddar and/or sour cream.

This was a great alternative to regular tomato based meat sauce. I added a little red bell pepper and left out the spice onions and corn. I also used half the ground beef and a 15 oz can of turkey chili. I added about a half can of water to the "sauce" for moisture. I also added about a half cup of shredded cheddar cheese and put some on the table to sprinkle on more. The kids were skeptical but won over. So quick and yummy!
