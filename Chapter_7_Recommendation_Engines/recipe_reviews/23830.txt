I have been making this sauce for over 1 year.  This is a GREAT recipe for sauce - My kids, ages 15, 9 & 7, LOVE it!!  Everytime I make it they all say "Mom, you make the BEST sauce!!" When we go out to eat they say "Mom you should give this restaurant your sauce recipe!!"  THANK YOU BRYAN this is the Absolute BEST SAUCE!!!   It's DELICIOUS!!!

I have used chunky tomatoes as well as puree and crushed.  Sometimes I add celery salt and sometimes I don't.  You don't necessarily need that ingredient, so if you don't have any don't go buy it just for this, it's PERFECT without it!!  And as far as chile pepper, I just use regular crushed red pepper and it works just fine.  You will LOVE it!!

FANTASTIC!  It was the perfect blend of sweet and hot.  The longer it simmered on the stove the hotter it got.  Next time we won't let it simmer quite so long.

Haven't yet gone food shopping I didn't have much on hand this afternoon but an abundance of pasta and no ready-made sauce in a jar.  I looked at the can of crushed tomatoes I had in the cupboard for months with the intent of making my own sauce and was finally forced to take the challenge...so glad I did.  This was the absolute best sauce I've ever tasted!!  I won't go back to jarred.  I only required 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Suggestion: only use 1 TBS oilve oil - 2 made a film of oil around the end that just wouldn't encorporate into the sauce.  Quick and Delicious!! Thanks Bryan!!!

This is AWESOME sauce!  I made a few minor variations - used chipotle chili pepper for a smoky spice, and threw in a small palmful of both basil and oregano (dried) for a tad more Italian flavor.  I added the 1/2 cup of brown sugar it says to do initially, but I only added about another 1/4 cup because it was perfect.

This is delish and different, not to mention easy.  I'll make it again!

This was easy to make and put a nice little spin on regular tomato sauce.  I put extra crushed chile peppers (closer to a full Tablespoon) in it because my husband and I like hot things.  It was a little too hot so next time I think I will stick to the recipe.  Someone else said that the brown sugar made it too sweet but I didn't think so.  I browned some ground turkey and added that.  I'll make this again.

I'll repeat what someone else has said, I will not go back to marinara in a jar!  If one follows to recipe correctly, it has a wonderful aroma and the balance of sweet and spicy is right on target.  I substituted the celery salt for 1/4TBLS of Garlic Salt and I also added 1 TBLS of dried Oregano.  I highly recommend this sauce!

This is the stuff italian-food dreams are made of. Soooo delicious, and quick to put together. I used crushed red pepper, omitted the celery salt and ended up using slightly less than 3/4 c. sugar. Also, used crushed tomatos with italian herbs. I think my husband would love this over some italian sausage.

I used seasoned diced tomatoes and only 1/4 cup sugar but it was still WAY too sweet.  I added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and it was much better.  Rating based on revisions.

Cut the brown sugar in half as well as the red pepper - maye add a bit more of both next time around.  Sauteed garlic and shrimp and put those with the sauce and just served that with roasted vegetables and bread on the side.  LOVED THAT MEAL!

I love this sauce.  The only sauce that my husband and i both like.  I add lean ground turkey and splendid brown sugar and it is still great.  I serve over whole wheat pasta and hubby barely notices.  Tasty, easy and healthy-very rare combo.  i make once a week.

This was not for us. I like sweet sauce, but this was overdoing it (and I used the minimum called for). It was spicy, but that did not improve the quality. Quite frankly, both my hubby and I thought it tasted like (and has the consistency of) ketchup. No other spices come through at all. Will not make again.

I gave this a 3 for initial preparation, and a 5, after modifications, for the final product, so averaging a 4. On first reading of the recipe, I knew there was too much sugar for my taste. I started with 1/4 cup - 4 tablespoons - and even then I added one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar to restore some acidity. As the author suggested re adding vegetables, I put in about a cup of sliced Baby Bella mushrooms, maybe 3/4 cup of coarse chop red onions, and some typical Italian herbs, all sautéed with the garlic. Also, I used celery seeds, having no celery salt. Since the recipe didn't specify how long to cook the sauce, I let mine simmer maybe an hour, tasting now and again, with a lid. The flavors blended nicely, although maybe still a tad too sweet. With the long simmer, the spices all toned down a bit, so you may want to readjust the pepper, oregano, etc. after a while. To my amazement, this turned out thick and very much like my mother's tomato sauce, and I know she didn't use sugar, let alone brown sugar! I think tomato paste, which many sauce recipes do not call for, adds a certain amount of sweetness and certainly body to the sauce. Like many stews and sauces, this is even better 2 days later! After slicing and sautéing, let it slow simmer and forget it. I'm going to double the recipe next time and freeze some! I had my doubts, but it's really quite good!

WOW!! I haven't been so stunningly pleased with a recipe for a long time! I made this sauce to go with 'Meatball Nirvana' posted by lovestohost as a sauce for meatball hogies, and I love the initial sweetness, followed by the spice. A little mozzarella cheese lightly toasted on top, and it is a perfect hogie. . . Thanks Bryan!

My search for the perfect homemade pasta sauce has ended! What a winner! I absolutely LOVE this combination of sweet and spicy. I added chopped onion and Italian sausage to the initial saute and followed the recipe from there. I also found that a 1/2 cup of brown sugar was plenty. I'll be making this sauce at Christmas and giving jars of it as gifts to my pasta loving pals! Thanks a million Bryan!

Good recipe. I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I added cooked ground beef. I also let cook on low in my crock pot for several hours! My husband loved it and the Kids even ate some! Will use again!

I really enjoyed this recipe - its something different but really tasty.  Unfortunately, my family didn't like it so I'll only be making it in small batches for myself.

I am one of those ones that is a little hesitant to try the recipes that have not been rated by many people but I am so glad that I did with this one. It was wonderful! A great blend of hot and sweet. I lessened the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup and it was perfect. I will definitely be making this one again.

Wonderful! I felt it was wonderful because I wanted to make something delicious with what i had in my kitchen that day (which was not much). And this was perfect! My boyfriend, who dislikes pasta, ate a whole serving, and then some!

Excellent sauce!  the receipe calls for 3/4cups of brown sugar.  I put in less than half of that and it was still a little too sweet.  Otherwise, very tasty!

Better than store bought!. Followed the recipe and it was very, very good. I thought it was a tad sweet, but husband said he thought it was just right. Next time I will cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and see if I like it better. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good!! I made it to go with "Crispy Chicken Parmesan" per the request of my son for his birthday supper choice - we all loved it! The only thing I'd do different next time is try it with a little less sugar, and we only used the initial 1/2c and found that to be a bit too much but it wasn't so bad, everyone liked it just thought it was a bit too sweet.

I love allrecipes and have over 100 recipes saved. But this is the first recipe that I've reviewed.  I just had to do it. This was not to my liking! I'm sorry, but the worst sauce I've ever had. Very bland, tasted like canned tomatoes, but with a kick that just didn't fit. Basically no spices at all and the brown sugar was just wrong. I have to say, it's coming out of my recipe box.

I doubled this recipe and now I can't wait to use the rest! I made spaghetti and meatballs (frozen) with this sauce last night and it was amazing. I used a little less brown sugar. I didn't have dried red chile pepper but I did have powdered red pepper which worked wonderfully. We had leftover Hawaiian rolls and their sweetness and the sauce's sweetness was so yummy together!  I can't wait to try this sauce on homemade pizza dough tomorrow night. When I asked my husband if he liked it, he said "This is the best sauce you have ever made!"

Good sauce but a little too sweet for an every day sauce. I really liked it because it was different.

I won't repeat a lot - except to say that the kids and wife loved this.   I kept the sugar at 1/4 cup, and probably over did it on the crushed chiles..... we will be having this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The spices were overwhelmed by the tomatoes. I'm also a big fan of chunkier, bolognese sauces for my pasta.

This has a really unique flavor with the start of sweet and the spicy finish.  My family still can't decide if they like it or not.  I would definately recommend trying it!

This is very sweet, I only used 1/2 cup sugar and had to put in more tomatoes and vinegar just to make it tolerable. I would advise anyone making this recipe to start with maybe 1/4 cup sugar and work your way up from there. It tasted quite nice after I added some basil and oregano to it, and I think it would be a really nice pizza sauce, not as good for pasta though. Thank you for submitting, it is a good base recipe to use as a starting point and modify to your taste.

Fabulous flavor, followed the recipe exact and also used some of the other viewers idea. Few questions if someone could respond back, how long do you cook the sauce for? my sauce even though it cooked on low simmer for 2 hours, burnt alittle on the bottom of the pan and had to change the pan twice, does anyone experience this. A few thoughts on the burning, could it be the thick tomato paste and or the brown sugar would cause the sauce to burn at the bottom of the pan, if anyone could help me out with these questions it would be great and share ideas you might have also.

More sweet than hot. I didn't know which type of peppers so I used a mix of ancho chile powder, cayenne pepper powder and crushed red pepper to equal the total amount. I only used 1 T of olive oil and browned a lb. of ground beef in with the garlic too. I really liked this a lot but my husband didn't and ate something else. Our teen devoured it without a word. I guess it's simply a matter of preference. I was surprised how good this was without a lot of spices and traditional spaghetti sauce herbs. I would fix this again for me, but my husband disliked it. Thanks, I enjoyed trying this!

I used 1 TBSP crushed red pepper.  WOW!!!!!!! TOO MUCH!!!!  I think the brown sugar needs to be only 1/3 cup as it was very sweet.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp each of parsley and oregano.  I used garlic powder instead of celery salt as well.  When my husband tasted it, his words were WOW!  He loved it, then again....he loves HOT sauces!  He said it was better than any restaurant sauce he ever had!

Excellent recipe!!  As some suggested, I tinkered with the recipe slightly. I sauteed a half cup or so of chopped onions with the garlic.  I only added a half cup brown sugar and added 2 tsps. of crushed red pepper. I served it over store bought crab/lobster/shrimp ravioli I purchased at our local BJ's warehouse store.  Since I had some frozen jumbo shrimp in our freezer, I also added them to the sauce till and cooked till done.  I served this with fresh Parmesan cheese.  DH went CRAZY over the recipe.  Thanks!!

This sauce is delicious!  I did not have any celery salt, so I used garlic salt instead.  I don't know if it made any difference.  I will definitely be making this sauce again.  The blend of sweet and spice is perfect!  I used the full 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  Great recipe!

I really liked this and my girlfriend loved it.  I used 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce instead of the paste or the tomatoes.  I also simmered the sauce for about an hour and added 1/2 an onion, 1 green and 1 red pepper, and also 2 cans of chopped mushrooms to give the sauce a little more substance.  I will be making this one again and again.  Enjoy.

This was excellent!  I used the entire 3/4 cup of brown sugar, and I was extremely liberal with crushed red pepper - perfect blend of sweet & spicy :)  We're definitely going to be making this again! Thank you!

This was one of the best pasta sauces i've ever tasted. If you cut back on the red pepper a bit, you get the exact recipe of my late grandfather, who in my opinion made the best sauce in the world.

Not the usual bland, bitter store junk!  I didn't add as much suger as suggested, but it did say to add slowly to taste.
I chopped a few green peppers and mushrooms into it and was AWSOME!
I love spicey foods and I am Vegetarian.  Perfect!
Will make over and over again!

I can't wait to try it with fresh ingredients!

I thought that it was the strangest ingredient, brown sugar.  I am Italian and have never added brown sugar, white sugar yes, really cuts down on the acidity.  I also added a few herbs, oregano and basil.  But this was very good.  I only added 1/2c brown sugar, I think 3/4c would be too sweet.  Nice change to regular spaghetti sauce.

We really loved this. The only things I done different was I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and thats because thats all I had and I added 1 can of tomato sauce trying to stretch the sauce because the recipe only served 4 and I needed to serve 6 and it did perfectly.

This was delicious! I don't think I added enough brown sugar, but it was still good. It was sweet at first, and the aftertaste was spicy. I added some oregano and basil as well.

I often use just plain tomato sauce instead of tomatoes+tomato paste but it doesn't matter...this sauce is off the hook!  It's a part of my regular meal rotation now.  I usually make it with sauteed red/green/yellow peppers and onions.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.

Thank you for such a FANTASTIC pasta sauce recipe!!! Anything sweet and spicy with tomatoes is definitely my thing. This recipe is very easy to make and very versatile -- you can almost add anything you like. I added Italian sausage, diced onions, mushrooms, and a bit of oregano. Yummy!

I'm really sold on this sauce - it's so good!  The multiple times I've made it I've used tomato sauce only instead of the tomatoes/paste combination and to give it a bit of texture I saute finely chopped onion with the garlic.  I also like to add some oregano along with the celery salt.

I prepared this sauce, not varying from the recipe, and it turned out much tangy - almost like pouring bbq sauce on my noodles. If I had wanted bbq sauce, I would have used it.

quite good! I found this recipe a little too sweet so i took some sugar out, but other than that great! It has quite a unique flavor.

Easy.  Pretty good - I used less heat because of my daughters.  Might have been better with more heat.  Just okay.  Not going to add it to my regular routine stuff.
