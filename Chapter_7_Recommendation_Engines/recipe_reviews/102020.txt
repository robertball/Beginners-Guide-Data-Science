Great recipe! I pounded the chicken down thin and let it marinate all day.  We grilled it and it came out very nice.  I did cut the olive oil in half for the marinade.  I also marinated the tomatoes in the olive oil (also cut that in half) and the balsamic vinegar along with some minced garlic, salt, pepper, 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and chopped fresh basil.  While the pasta was boiling I sauteed 1/2 c. of chopped onion then added the tomatoe mixture and let that warm up just a bit.  Tossed that in with the chicken and pasta and topped it with a little parmesan cheese - delicious!

I made a few changes but my fiance said this was the best thing I ever made for him. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken 2 hours so here is what I did: I combined the balsamic vinegar and olive oil and set the chicken in there for about 30 min. Meanwhile, I chopped the garlic and sauteed with mushrooms and two dried basil leaves (didn't have fresh) until brown. I browned the chicken then added the garlic, mushrooms, and basil back in as well as 2 cans of diced tomatoes (1 fire roasted and 1 italian). I let this cook and simmer for about 15 min and served with pasta. It was delish.

This was great.  I was bored and searched recipes that had Balsamic since we had some on hand. This is definitely my new favorite.  Not too many ingredients, and tasted so good.  I know this is a bit silly to say, but it even looked great.  There are several recipes that I make that taste wonderful, but aren't impressive to look at. This will be something to serve for any night of the week or when we have friends over.  I didn't change a thing either.

A new favorite! I pounded the chicken and marinated overnight. Sauteed the tomatoes with a large onion and a couple cloves of garlic. Other than that i made as directed and it was fantastic.

This was amazing! I LOVED the marinade. I didn't have any grape tomatoes so I chopped up some hot house. I also threw in some feta cheese on top. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it.

This recipe worked great in the slow cooker for 6 hours on low. I did not marinate prior to cooking in the slow cooker or brown chicken in skillet. I simply put all ingredients in the crock pot, except for the noodles and tomatoes. Amazing flavor! Very easy to make, too! I will definitely make for our family again!

Phenomenal!  If you like balsamic vinegar and haven't tried this, you are missing out!  Subbed Farfalle noodles for the penne out of preference.  Topped with mozzarella cheese.  Out of this world, yum!

This was really good but I ended up changing the recipe a bit to make it even easier.  For the marinade I used store-bought pesto and blended with a bit more olive oil and balsamic.  I marinated bonless tenders, and then sauteed them for a few minutes and kept them in the pan and tossed in onions and sliced mushrooms.  after they cooked a bit, I added sliced yellow cherry tomatoes (for a bit of color) and  a can of diced tomatoes with juice.  Let that cook down a bit and tossed my cooked rigatoni into the sautee pan.  Delish and ready in 15 minutes.  Thanks for the inspiration.

This sauce was very good. I was already marinating some chicken and was looking for a sauce. I had to substitute the grape tomatoes for canned. But it was still excellent. Next time I will make double and marinate it in the sauce. Keeping this one in my recipe box!

super yummy! I actually ended up marinating them for 2 days and it still turned out perfect.  I did add some mozzarella cheese (between the noodles and the chicken) and feta to it in the end really gives it a kick! I will be making this again.

This was really good and suprisingly easy! Next time I would maybe add some spinach and/or mushrooms but overall i thought it was delicious. Just a side note, it does not re-heat well.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Thank you for the recipe!  only changes I made were to chop up roma tomatoes and use those instead of cherry tomatoes.. and I added some shredded mozzarella cheese.  This is good cold too!

Wonderful recipe!  The only thing I did differently was I grilled the chicken for a few minutes on each side, then placed all the breasts in a baking dish with the rest of the marinade and baked at 350 for 15 minutes (they were thick breasts).  The addition of some sauteed Shitake Mushrooms were really fantastic.  Added a true depth of flavor.

I LOVE this recipe but being time poor I tend to buy a quarter roast chicken (makes 2) or a full roast chicken from the deli  dice up the meat and marinade it for half an hour-hour then boil up the pasta and stir it in. It soaks into the cooked chicken and works really really well while saving so much time and effort and still tasting fabulous.

Really delicious...Excellent flavor...The only change I made was to saute a half onion and a half red pepper (chopped) in margarine and I added this to the chicken before placing chicken in oven...This dish was very flavorful...and I will be making again.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!!  I love trying a new recipe that comes out excellent to mine and the hubby's standards!  We're picky!  I think I would cut back on a little bit of the oil next time though.  I have to read the rest of the reviews and see if anyone else tried something different!

All-in-all, this is a pretty tasty recipe. The directions could have been a little better, like stating whether or not to add the chickens marinade to the pasta after cooked, or even to cook the chicken in it's marinade.  My girlfriend and I liked this a lot, with some alterations; A large bowl works fine for marinating the chicken (refrigerate covered about 45 mins - 1 hr). We mashed in about 1/3 cup Philly cream cheese to the chickens marinade before cooking, and used the marinade as pasta sauce. For the halved tomatoes, we thinly sliced about 4 or 5 big basil leaves and added 2 tbl spns olive oil, and 1 tbl spn balsamic vinegar. We place the tomatoes on the pasta after it was served. Looked, smelled, and tasted great. 4/5

This absolutely delicious.  I sauteed mushrooms and onions in the same pan that I browned the chicken in plus a couple tablespoons of butter.  Once the chicken was out of the oven and sliced I added it to the pan of mushrooms and onions and covered put on low to simmer.  I added my sliced tomatoes, sliced basil with the fourth cup of oil and balsamic vinegar and let marinate.  This was done before I even started cooking the chicken.  When the noodles were done, I put them in a bowl poured the whole pan of chicken, mushrooms, onions and all the juice in the pan on the noodles then poured the tomato mixture on the noodles and tossed.  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, chicken was tender, juicy and so incredibly flavorful.  I topped with parmesan cheese.  This is a fave dish and will be serving it regularly.  Even my seven and fourteen year old LOVED IT!

This is just wonderful.  I marinated the chicken overnight just to make it easier to prepare on a weeknight.  The chicken smells absolutely divine as you are cooking.  I had to use dried basil as it was all I had on hand.  Added some fresh parmesan (and red pepper on mine for a little zip).  Beautiful, light and yummy.

Super!  The chicken was wonderfully flavorful!  I marinaded in the fridge overnight.  The pasta was wonderful also, but I only added half the balsamic vinegar....after reading the other reviews.  It was a big hit!

This smelled delicious cooking and the chicken came out very tender.  I had to down size the recipe so I think I may have not added enough of something because the final dish was sort of bland and somewhat dry.  I will use that marinade again though-it was awesome!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I had no idea how much two ounces of basil is (used fresh from our garden), so I used a good-sized handful.  I cut this recipe in half for three people.  Using my Vitamix blender, the marinade part of this didn't chop up fine until I got all of the ingredients in the blender, including the balsamic.  I only had an hour to marinade, so I cut my chicken breasts in half.  I removed them from the marinade and grilled them quickly over very low heat.  I used another "handful" of basil with the pasta and tomatoes (the fresh, uncooked tomato/basil combination here is excellent).  We topped it with a little fresh parmesan.  Keep in mind that when you're serving uncooked ingredients like olive oil, balsamic, etc. - you want to use top-shelf quality.  My 8yo son gave this two thumbs-up!  We will definitely keep it in our summer rotation, when basil and tomatoes are at their peak.

WOW!!!! I LOVE IT!!! My husband does too! I had to use spaghetti noodles and didn't have tomatoes, but it was still DELICIOUS! I also took the advice of cooking through on the stove top. I've also used the oil, vinegar, basil, and Fetta cheese on my salads ALL week! This is definetely one of my favorite dishes now! Thanks sooooo much for sharing!

Great Recipe!!!! I followed it exactly except I quarted my tomatoes. I just like them smaller. I was really concerned about 2 ounces of fresh basil, but it was fabulous. I eaten it warm and cold and it is great both ways. The recipe says 6 servings but I divided it up into 12 servings. This recipe makes a lot!

Outstanding flavor. I cooked the chicken through on the stovetop--didn't need the oven. Used whole wheat pasta for a really healthy, filling dish. Yum! It smells amazing while cooking.

Perfect!  A bit time consuming, but it all works well together (you're always doing something while other things are happening), it's a very well organized recipe!  I felt there wasn't enough "sauce" on the dish, but my guests and husband enjoyed it as is!  Made enough for 6 EASILY!  Delicious!

Really really liked this. I did it on the george forman and the chicken is to die for.  I will be making the chicken over and over.  The dish was great but id use less balsamic vinegar in the last step.  I enjoyed it but it was a little to strong of a taste for the kids.   This makes a huge amount of food even for our family of 6..

Didn't have time to marinate for hours and it's too hot to turn on the oven, so cut chix into chunks, marinated while I prepped and then cooked all on stove top.  I would give it 5 stars for aroma too.  Sauted some onion and red pepper with it too.  YUMMY!

Tasty and easy dish!  Will definitely make again.  Here's what I did: Used 2 chicken breasts, but halved the quantities (to make 3 servings).  Marinated in the fridge for 4 hours.  Subbed campari tomatoes (9-10 of them, sliced into 1/6ths) and marinated in the olive oil / balsamic vinegar mixture with salt and pepper for 15 minutes.  Followed instructions for browning the chicken - note to self for next time: put olive oil in the pan first! Otherwise, the chicken will stick to it...  Also sauteed 1 small chopped onion + 2 cloves of garlic + 1 chopped yellow pepper (do not omit!), and added the tomato mixture into it.  To finish off, tossed the pasta and chicken into the sauce and mixed it all up.  Very yummy and easy to make.  :)

I made this recipe almost exactly as written for a potluck. The only change I made was to drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt and roast them in the oven. It was okay, but definitely not a hit at the potluck-- I had a lot leftover. It would have been better with parm cheese or something. I'd probably make it again because it was easy, but may make some modifications so people (and myself!) like it enough to go back for seconds.

This was really good.  I didn't add the additional balsamic/olive oil at the end because it seemed like too much and it was perfect without it.  The only change I would make next time is to add the tomatoes to the chicken in the oven because I like my tomotoes cooked a little.

Perhaps I did not use enough oil in cooking, but I had no "juices" in the pan to speak of, hence, the dish came out a bit dry.  Next time, I may make a pesto sauce (using basil, garlic, nuts, and olive oil) to serve on the side.

Amazing!  I can't believe more people haven't tried this recipie.  It is perfect how it is.  We did chop up regular tomatoes because we didn't have cherry, but it is so good.  We also only marinated it for 2 hours...we were too hungry to wait.  Try this recipie - so fresh nd delicious.

I did something a little different with this recipe. I didn’t have access to a grill so I cooked the chicken in a pan on the stove, melting 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter first. When the chicken breast was 1/2 way done, I removed them and added halved sweet grape tomatoes, sliced yellow bell pepper, minced garlic, sliced sweet onion, halved kalamari olives, 1 teaspoon of workishire sauce, and 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar. I let it simmer for 5 minutes before returning the chicken breast to the pan. And I than cooked the chicken until it was about done, I than added sliced mozzarella balls to the tops of the chicken so it could melt. Pairs really good served over angel hair pasta!

We loved this.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used a little dried basil instead.  I didn't have enough tomatoes on hand, so I used what I had and it was still delicious.  This is a keeper.

Very quick and easy to make and delicious on top of that! Had most of the ingredients on hand, which is always a bonus. I did not deviate from the recipe, but I did cut it in half as I was only cooking for 2. There was enough for us to make another meal of the leftovers. I will definitely make again.

The method for cooking the chicken in this recipe was perfect! Marinade gave it great flavor and the cooking method made it juicy and delicious!

This was SOOO good!!!! So I followed the recipe as is and marinated for 3 hours. When I started to brown the chicken I realized the paste was a little bland so I added more salt to the pan. Then when the chicken was baking, I sautéed onion and spinach in that same pan with the rest of the marinade. I added salt, some adobo, garlic powder to it also. I cut the tomatoes with the olive oil and balsamic and set aside, sliced up the chicken and added it to the spinach pan and poured the tomato mix over the pasta. Im telling you when I took that first bite I was like UGHH SOO GOOD!!!!! Can't wait for hubby to get home and try it!

I'm giving this a 4 because my husband liked it more than I did. Heads up.  At least the 1st time around I could not do all the prep in 15 minutes...they don't count the pan searing time and I do as you have to be there. Plus this dish requires a number of pots and pans, blender or cuisinart.  But it is tasty and different. Try it first before you entertain with it to see what you think.

I followed the recipe and added zucchini to get my vegetables in. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces when I marinate them and let them sit for two hours, but next time I would definitely let them sit overnight. The pasta tasted kinda bland last night when I made it but it taste really good when I eat it for lunch today, prob just takes some time for the flavor to sink it to the pasta.

Made this recipe tonight and LOVED it. We added zucchini and a bit of fresh mozzarella cheese, and used our garlic cilantro infused balsamic. The chicken was so tender... almost melted in my mouth! YUMMMM.

I had an idea of something similar to this recipe and found this when I googled balsamic chicken. I had to change a few things based on the ingredients that I had, but this was a wonderful starter recipe to adapt. The only thing I would suggest is not to use as much balsamic as it calls for in the sauce. I only used 1 T and it was perfect. You could still taste the flavors.

I made this tonight with my 8-yr old daughter.  A nice, simple recipe that was easy to prepare.  We only marinated the chicken for 30 mins and then broiled but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was flavorful and tender while the pasta tasted fresh and light with the tomatoes and basil.  Very nice, simple meal.  Thank you for sharing.

I've made this many, many times with minor adjustments. I omit the salt and pepper all together. Doesn't really need it. I also don't bother getting the food processor dirty, so I just whisk the oil, vinegar, minced garlic, and ribboned basil together. While the pasta and the chicken is cooking, I put the tomatoes and more fresh basil in a large bowl and add the 1/4 vinegar and 1/4 oil and let it sit. I add the hot pasta on top, which slightly softens the tomatoes. Then add the chicken and toss together!  Great dish! A family favorite! I also make this with only 1 lb chicken, 1 pint tomatoes, 1 lb pasta. FRESH basil is KEY.

I really enjoyed the lightness and overall flavor of this dish, but the balasmic seemed a bit too sweet. I marinated over night, I might try a couple hours next time and see if that cuts down on the sweetness. I cut my olive oil in 1/2 in the marinade and sauce. I also used Italian stewed tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes (what was in teh pantry).

This dish is GREAT!  The only alteration I made was grilling the chicken and adding a little feta cheese before serving.  My nine-year old said it was the best chicken he ever had!

I liked this quite a bit and my husband absolutely loved it. A couple of bites in he claimed it was his new favourite pasta dish. I added some feta at the very end as suggested by another reviewer and I found the saltiness of the cheese complemented the dish nicely. Thanks, Katherine!

This was delicious! Good olive oil and aged mellow balsamic are paramount. I had some fabulously fresh tasty tomatoes that I damaged by baking. Next time I make this, I'll chill it, not bake the tomatoes, and serve it cold for a picnic. Very good! Thanks!

This was tasty.  I used thin chicken breasts so I just cooked them in the pan and didn't transfer them to the oven.  Definitely add fresh basil as this compliments the balsamic. Bon Appetit

This has a great flavor!  I even used a can of diced tomatoes and it was still very good.  The only reason I subtracted a star was that I think the balsamic vinegar in the marinade is enough.  I think any more will really overpower the meal.  It was great and I would definitely make this again!

This is so flavorful and really easy to make. I marinated the chicken for 4 hours, I can only imagine how it would taste if marinated overnight. Everyone raved about the flavor and I was thrilled with the results. A great summer dish that I will keep on the menu.

This is delicious!!  You can add things like feta cheese, diced red onion or artichoke hearts if you have them on-hand.  So versatile, but the basic recipe is amazing!  I also mixed a little tomato paste in with the oil and vinegar and it gives it a little kick.  This will definitely be a summer favorite!

This was really great. I tweaked it a little by putting in diced tomatoes instead of grape, and much less oil in the noodles! Filling dinner great for the whole family!
