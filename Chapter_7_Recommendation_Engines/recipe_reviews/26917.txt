Good quick and easy but how can you go wrong with any of these ingredients? It doesn't make very much so you might want to double it if you're feeding a crowd.

I have a version of this recipe that is only a bit different. I only add 1/4 cup of salsa so that the dip doesn't turn a strange shade of pink (not very appetizing even though it tastes good!). I also stay away from red pepper unless I chop them well in advance and they have been drained. Otherwise the water from the peppers makes the dip runny... People at parties and picnics can't get enough of this dip and I have handed out the recipe 100 times. I prefer sharp cheddar cheese to mild as it gives the dip an extra kick. That is a matter of personal preference though...

I changed recipe slightly and it was still great. Use 1-8oz cream cheese 1/2 cup garden salsa 1 cup finely shredded mild cheddar 3 TBS chopped black olives 1 tsp green onion (no red bell pepper). Use a hand mixer to blend all ingredients together. Sprinkle some finely shredded mild cheddar on top and chill. Serve with crackers.

Very good and tasty recipe. Perfect for parties get togethers etc. Just be careful when mixing salsa with cream cheese mixing too much makes it pink. Otherwise very good! Everyone loved it!

A solid recipe - I used fresh salsa (Pico de Gallo) it comes together quickly and everyone seems to like it. Thanks.

There wasn't really anything exciting about this recipe. It was very easy to throw together. Sorry but this was just ok.

It was good for what it was a quick basic salsa & cream cheese dip. It came together quickly and I liked that I was able to prep it the day before a party. I did put the fresh veggies on top the day of but even the following day it tasted nearly as fresh. I really didn't want a pink-colored cream cheese dip so I used a roasted tomatillo salsa and think it turned out very pretty. If I make it again I may use more salsa so that it isn't so "heavy" and thick.
