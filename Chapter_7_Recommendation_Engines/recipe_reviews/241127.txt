3.1.17  I was a bit concerned about the amount of corn syrup making this too sweet, so I did reduce that amount by 1/3.  Blended the dressing, tasted, and then added more red pepper flakes (personal taste preference), otherwise followed the recipe.  Dressing has a nice bright and tangy flavor, certainly was quick and easy to make, and was a nice luncheon pasta salad today.

This is a Good Recipe for pasta salad. I made 3 x's so far and forgot to take a picture. I put a little spin on mine, extra Balsamic Dressing, lots of pepper roni, and salami, and Italian dressing. Awesome

I used lots more Parmesan cheese because we love the flavor. I also added some Dijon mustard to the dressing- about 1 tablespoon. I had to use red wine vinegar since that’s what I had on hand. Very flavorful!! And the flavor held into the next day where as some dressings just don’t keep that tangy flavor.
