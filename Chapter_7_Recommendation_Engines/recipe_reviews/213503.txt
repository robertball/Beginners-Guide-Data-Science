I absolutely LOVE this soup.  I thought it had a ton of flavor.  I changed it a bit and heated some garlic in EVOO right away in the beginning and then added everything to that.  I also doubled the recipe and added garbanzo beans. I had to salt the soup slightly and also added chopped cilantro on the top when I served.  My hubby said it was one of his favorite soups of all time.  Great recipe and so quick and easy!  I know I will be making this one often.  :)

So good! I seasoned the chicken and sauteed up about 1/4c. of diced onion before adding to the soup. Served with buttermilk biscuits.

This didn't ring any bells at our house, but it was good.

Very tasty..made a few changes used cream of chicken soup, added a 1/4 cup of soymilk, and added a tsp of onion powder...would have perferred fresh onion.  Chopped up fresh celery and threw that in.  Used stewed tomatoes added a can of butter beans also....all in all wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, quick & easy! What more could you ask for? I used Hormel real bacon bits and some leftover chicken I had on hand. Threw it together in minutes and kept it warm in the crockpot while I went to class. Served with homemade garlic bread. yum!

Sooo good.   Everyone I've ever served this to loves this soup- from my 2 year old granddaughter to my 91 year old father.  The only changes I make are to add a second can of beans (I use navy beans).    I also use chicken broth instead of water.  Delicious!

eh. This is strictly OK. It tasted really processed, but I probably should have expected that. I did add basil, but I don't think it made much difference.

Okay I am giving this a middle of the road rating to start with because I am in the process of making it now & figure this will obligate me to finish the review!  I don't want to go to the store and have no celery soup and no baby spinach leaves!  So am going to try it with Cream of Chicken Soup and some celery salt and celery seeds, and use Romaine lettuce instead of spinach. I've sauteed a little chopped onion and garlic in EVOO based on others' comments, and have added a little chicken flavor granules and a pinch of white pepper to the broth.  Will come back and let you know! (Wish me luck!)

This soup was all right, but not a favorite of ours. It was very easy and quick to make so that was a plus. I felt like all we could taste was the spinach and not much else. My four year old didn't want to eat "the green stuff" so he picked all of that out, but my one year old seemed to like it pretty well though. I'm hoping that with the leftovers the soup will kind of meld together a little better, and the spinach taste won't be as strong. We'll see. Great for convenience, but the taste wasn't that great.

Very very good soup! Extra Parmesan cheese and a bit of butter added to it also gives it a bit more Italian flavor.

I loved this soup.  Don't add any extra salt if you're using bacon bits; it doesn't need it.
