Made this for the Recipe Group. We really enjoyed this sandwich. Hubby took a bite and said "Wow!" always a good sign! I couldn't find any focaccia bread at my bakery so I made my own using Michael's Foccacia Bread (on this site) it was great. I did add more mayo to the chipotle mayo since it was a bit spicy for my tastes. Also I don't have a panini press so I heated up a non stick pan and a cast iron pan, put the sandwich in the non stick pan then placed the hot cast iron pan down on the top and pressed down slightly, using a hot pad. It worked really great. Thanks for the recipe!

Really liked this, except I used only one chipotle pepper in the mayonnaise.  We found it spicy enough for us, that way.  Other than that, I made the recipe as stated.  If you don't have focaccia,  I think any sliced, substantial bread would work.  I'm happy to find another way to make panini!  Thanks!

Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding! My husband & oldest son are begging me to make these again 2 days later! I only used 1 chipotle, which was perfect heat for them. On mine, I used garlic mayo instead(not a chipotle fan). I used ciabatta bread & just toasted it(no panini maker). I think this has moved to the #1 spot on our favs from AR!!

We make these (& LOTS of other panini's) all the time on either our GF grill or cast iron skillet! We use a couple teaspoons of olive oil instead of the butter, onions depending upon our mood & just 1 (or none) of the chipotles. Deli turkey, leftover rotisserie chicken, provolone or mozzarella...the ingredients can actually be determined by what you have on hand. It's pretty hard to mess this one up!

I made this for company last night and we loved it.  The only change I made was to use 2 slices of cheese per sandwich instead of one.  We love cheese.

This was delicious!  After I cooked the bacon I poured off some of the grease but left a little to cook my onion, spinach and garlic in.  Saves you a dirty pan.  The mayo was yummy!  Once again...delicious!

I don't have a panini press, so I used my indoor grill.  Using a square baking pan, I gently pressed down on the sandwich as it was cooking.  Flipped it over and repeated on the other side. You could easily do this on a BBQ grill, too.

I used freeze dried red onions, monterey jack cheese, and precooked bacon. I also had jalapeno cheese focaccia bread that I bought at HEB. I had to scale the ingredients in my head for just one sandwich. Everything else I prepared as the recipe called. I am in love with this sandwich. I honestly didn't think I was going to like it because of the spinach, but that was one of the best parts. I will definitely make again for the family. One more thing...I don't have a panini grill. I didn't even grill it. I know I made changes and I hate when people rate things based on their changes, but this sandwich could only be a hundred times better if it was grilled and made exactly as written.

Made this for Recipe Group.  This is an excellent sandwich!  I didn’t have focaccia bread, so I used a sandwich Italian and I don’t have a panini press, so these were done on a griddle pan.  I was cautious with the Chipotle peppers and just added them to taste and then opted to serve it on the side, rather than putting it on the sandwich.  We both really enjoyed this one and would definitely make it again!

I really liked this, but hubby wasn't as keen so we compromised on the rating. I did use homemade Ciabatta bread though. I want to make again, but need to have hubby agree.

This was a great receipe.. my first time making a panni.. I don't have a panini press so i used my cast iron grill i put on my gas stove on low heat... I used a brick double covered in aluminum foil, got that from Rachel Ray... Since i was making this for 1 person.. myself.. so I cut the ingrediants.. Also since I am on a low fat diet I had to change some of the ingredients. I made my spread from lite mayo , spicy mustard , and mixed sundried tomatoes in with it..mmmmmmmmmmmm  delicious.. I use jack cheese .. And since I had just loaf bread.. I used my whole wheat bread ... This sandwich was so good.. Much better than having a plain turkey sandwich.

Used George Foreman Grill instead of Panini press. Cooked for 3 to 4 min this way. Also used Flat Focaccia Bread. Used turkey bacon in replace of bacon to reduce fat. Very Delicious.

This was very good. I just used plain mayo. We don't like chipotle. The garlic, spinach, onion mixture is a winner!! I didn't have focaccia, I used a wheat loaf and it was very good.

I have made these twice and have turned out great both times.  The first time I forgot the red onion but added it the second time.  I thought the red onion was a little too strong but my husband liked it.  Also to make it easier and because my kids don't like spicy, I added some chipotle hot sauce to the mayo instead of the chipotle in adobo for my husband and I and the kids just got plain mayo.  This saves me from buying a whole can of chipotle in adobo and only using a small portion of it.  Just used regular bread that I had on hand too.

Excellent panino recipe. Halving the adobo sauce and the chopped chipotle made this plenty spicy but capable of being eaten by a bigger group.

I've made these twice, now, and both times they were absolutely delicious.  The first time, I used all of the ingredients exactly as listed in the recipe.  My hubby and I both LOVED the sandwiches.  But last night, I opened up the new package of turkey only to find that it was spoiled from being improperly sealed.  So, hubby suggested using tomato slices instead.  I built the sandwiches the same way, and added one extra slice of cheese before topping it with the bread, then grilled.  They were fantastic, and just as tasty!  Just goes to show how versatile these sandwiches can be.  Thanks so much for sharing this!!  P.S.  I use the "Fantastic Focacia Bread" recipe on this site for the bread - you can't go wrong.

I wasn't sure at all about the spinach part of this sandwich but decided to roll the dice and follow instructions exactly.  What good instincts I have! This was incredible!  It takes a little work for what is supposed to be our quick Tuesday sandwich night but certainly worth the effort.  I did use pre-cooked bacon, the only change I made and both hubby and I loved these. Will be repeating often.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed some of the suggestions and used less of the chipotle peppers and we all loved it.   I even made a large batch of the chipotle mayo to use on other sandwiches. Have made this a half dozen times and it has become a family favorite.

Loved it! The only change I made was using turkey bacon instead of normal bacon. My husband is obsessed with this sauce , but we did notice it tastes best hot (not on a cold sandwich). He also said I could sell this sandwich it was so good, but I can't take the credit. :) Will definitely make again, much to my husband's delight!

Bought a panini grill today, and was looking for a recipe that used what I already had on hand. This fit the bill! I didn't want to dirty up two pans. Instead of cooking the bacon in one pan and the veg in another, I cooked the veg in the bacon grease (well, some of it) after the bacon was done. I didn't have chipotle in adobo, so I made the sauce with mayo, sambal oelek and chipotle powder. Pretty good substitute. Also, cutting the onions in slices makes it tough to eat, always pulling out strings when taking a bite. I'll dice the onion next time. Alas I didn't have focaccia, had to make due with plain old rye bread. All in all, this was a great combination of flavors and a nice way to break in the panini grill.

This sandwich was really tasty and we will make it often. Everything just seemed to go together and I followed the recipe exactly.

Delicious!  I had to use regular sourdough bread because I dropped the ball on making the foccacia.  It was delicious!  Quick and easy but I ended up with fabulous results!

excellent flavor ... a bit time consuming for a sandwich, but the end result was well worth it. I added sliced avocado (because I love turkey, bacon, w/ avocado) and used ciabatta rolls since the grocery store didn't have any focaccia bread. Other than that, followed the recipe as written -- delicious!
