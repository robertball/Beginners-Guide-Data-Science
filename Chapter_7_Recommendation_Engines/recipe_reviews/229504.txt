Terrific. I loved it and so did my girlfriend. 
- I added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a little extra spice,
- I used angel hair pasta b/c that's what I had on hand
- I added a teaspoon of sugar as suggested
Otherwise left as is. Really tasty. Thanks, Brianna!

I've made this dish twice. I followed the directions exactly. one time, I used plain canned tomatoes, the other time, as the recipe states, I used the San Marzano tomatoes. The difference is noticeable. Use the San Marzano to get this dish tasting perfect!

Good base recipe. Adding just a pinch of cayenne helps and add more if you'd like it spicier.

This was heavenly! I altered it a little bit, using crushed tomatoes and adding a teaspoon of sugar. This recipe is definitely on my list of keepers! So delicious!

This is the best vodka sauce I've ever had hands down! I used half and half instead of cream and the sauce was perfect. It didn't make as much as I anticipated so next time I will double the recipe but I wouldn't change anything else. Thank you for sharing!

This was easy and delicious!I made some adjustments. I did not have San Marzano plum tomatoes so I used a can of crushed tomatoes. I doubled the garlic because I love garlic. I sauteed the garlic and spices in a little olive oil before adding the tomatoes to release all the flavors. I used fresh basil because I am growing it in my garden and have an abundance. I had light cream instead of heavy cream so that's what I used. I added about a teaspoon of sugar as others had suggested and it was perfect!

Even my picky husband liked it! I usually include meat and veggies in my pasta sauce so I first cooked about a lb of sweet Italian sausage and chopped up some raw asparagus and added them to the sauce. The meat made the sauce hardy and the asparagus added a bit of color and texture. If I don t have asparagus next time I may throw in a handful of frozen peas. Thanks for this recipe.

This was better after adding 2 tsp. of sugar. I also added some frozen turkey Italian meatballs and fresh parsley over the top.

I made this looking for a meatless vodka sauce recipe. It was very good but somewhat lacked flavor. Next time I would add some red pepper flakes as suggested and some olive oil.

This was amazing! I saut√©ed prosciutto and white onions and added to the sauce as it was simmering, delicious!
