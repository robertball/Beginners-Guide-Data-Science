Lazy Golumpki Haiku: "Used some of cook's notes, coz we don't like it too saucy. Couple swaps as well." Unlike the recipe submitter who prefers a wetter golumpki, we want it a little more dry, so I only used 1 15 oz. can of Hunt's tomato sauce; I believe it was an Italian-seasoned one. To save a step, I used a coleslaw-mix produce bag, but added some work back in (lol) by using 1/2 chopped onion instead of onion powder. This is one of those very forgiving, very comforting casseroles that some may call bland, but we just love. Other than it possibly needing garlic (and myself adding Sriracha to my plate), I think it was great. Making it ahead of time and leaving it covered in the oven for a bit longer than the recipe stated (so the cabbage on top didn't char too much) made dinner even easier.

Easy and perfect lazy golumpki recipe. I did add a teaspoon of paprika and tweaked recipe slightly by excluding tomato soup and crushed tomato. I added 24 ounce pasta sauce and 14.5 ounce of stewed tomatoes. A little less liquid than what recipe called for but it wasn't too dry. I like golumpki's and would make this lazy version again.

As always, the first time I make  a recipe, I follow it exactly. Not complicated to make, but disappointed in lack of flavor. Very bland. Would like to make it again but not sure what to add to give it a boost! Great texture, perfect amount of liquid. Maybe next day it will taste better!

Makes more than will fit into a 9x13. Husband and father-in-law thought it was good. I found it lacking. Iâ€™ll try some of the others.

I used red cabbage because it is better for you than green, and because of my food intolerances, I had to substitute the soups for other things like more tomatoes and some ketchup. Will do it again!

We love golumpki at home but it is a lot of work. This is a great replacement when you get the craving. The whole family loved it even going for seconds. We followed the recipe to the letter and came out great. A few of us drizzled a little ketchup on it as we do with golumpki. We will make it again.
