I made these for Christmas eve with the relatives.  WONDERFUL!!!  I did add spinach to the mix and they were eaten up in no time flat. My husband doesn't even like spinach.  I'm positive I will make these again.

Be careful to adjust to your taste - I cut the Cayenne pepper in half to begin with and these still had a little kick...  but were a good breakfast treat.  Thank you.

These are great to even double the recipe, cook, then freeze!

These were easy and worked...we just did not like the strong cream cheese flavor and felt that it needed more seasonings or maybe sauteed onions and garlic to boost the flavor. Cayenne was too hot for us too.

I added additional seasoning, and also cut up pepperoni.  It was very good.
