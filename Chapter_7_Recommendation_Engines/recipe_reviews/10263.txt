These are fantastic, like eggnog in a cookie! My grandmother used to make these with this variation: Don't color the icing.  After frosting the cookie, score lengthwise with fork tines, then sprinkle with nutmeg.  Meant to look like snow-covered bark.  Bigger kids can help frost and roll the logs.

Would give these cookies 10 stars if I could. Just WONDERFUL! I did use the nutmeg sprinkle on top (like the first reviewer) instead of the food coloring. I had 14 people over for Christmas Eve, and over a dozen different kinds of Christmas cookies (had help) and this one EVERYONE raved about. A definate keeper.  Thanks Carol

I love nutmeg cookie logs!  We have used this recipe for years and also don't color the frosting.  We use a star tip to frost & also sprinkle with nutmeg.   A holiday favorite

PLEASE do not color the icing! This cookie is meant to LOOK like a LOG; thus, score the icing with fork tines and sprinkle with nutmeg. Icing can't be too thin, or you won't accomplish the look of rough bark. I ship these off to my brother and sister every Christmas, as this cookie has been a family tradition.  It has carried over to MY children. This is one of two cookies REQUIRED at Christmas. No rum in mine, and I actually use half unsalted butter, half margarine, which gives me the taste and texture I want.

OMG! This cookie is so simple, I didn't even have to make a trip to the store for anything. And WOW! These cookies, with the icing, have the perfect taste for Christmas. I'm taking them for dinner on Christmas Eve, and I should wait to get feedback before reviewing, but it doesn't matter what anyone else tells me, I'm making these cookies again and again.

These were great - I had just returned from St Lucia and wanted to make something using the fresh nutmeg I brought back. I used rum (also from St Lucia) instead of rum extract. I rolled them into logs and then put the ends together to make rings.

I have made these a few times over the course of 35 years, following a recipe that had the wrong amount of butter.   They came out hard as a brick !  I made these with the correct amount of butter, and they were delicious and soft  !    The right texture,  absolutely perfect !   I will make these again and again !

My family has been making these cookies for Christmas for over 40 years.  Only, we don't dye the frosting and we run a fork through the frosting and sprinkle with nutmeg. It gives it the appearance of a log and tastes spectacular!  They are my absolute favorites!

I love these cookies! I omitted all rum, did not color the icing and sprinkled with nutmeg on top. The icing really makes this cookie.

These are a family staple during the holidays.  I had lost the original family recipe, this is a very close version.  I did not use any food coloring, and when making them.  I also use the cookie press when making them instead of rolling into logs.  
Was very excited to have found this receipe

Great recipe--made as a gift for a friend as it is his childhood favorite. Made them about an inch and a half instead of recipe's 3 inch length, frosted, sprinkled with fresh nutmeg, then piped with green frosting for holly leaves with a cinnamon red hot center--very pretty for the holidays!

These cookies are fantastic! This is the exact recipe my mom used when I was a child 50 years ago! I omitted the food coloring.  I also score the frosting lengthwise with  fork tines then, sprinkled with nutmeg.

I am so happy to have found this recipe.  I used to make these cookies at Christmas and lost the recipe many years ago.  I would not use the red food coloring but the rest of the recipe looks exactly like the one I used.  Can't wait to make these for the family again.

Really good! For some reason my dough wouldn't roll into logs, so I just made them into little round cookies.

Excellent and easy! The flavor is unbeatable. I did not use red food coloring; they turned out great!
