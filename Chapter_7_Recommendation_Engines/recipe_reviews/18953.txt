Enjoyable drink and easy to make. Made it with some bottled lime juice as I didn't have any limes. I will definitely be making this again.

love it.  Thanks.  I put the lime juice and sugar in the blender first, mixed, then added ice cube one at a time and added the rum as needed until it was all blended.  Excellent frozen drink.

This was pretty good. It did seem like it was missing something though, not sure what.

I looooove this but omitted the maraschino cherries  (couldn't find any) and used a few mint leaves instead. Perfect!

Tried this recipe last night and would have reviewed it then but after two of these there were two keyboards in front of me. Will probably try with a little less sugar next time.
Simple, easy and tasty!
