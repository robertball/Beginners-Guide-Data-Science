I gave this recipe 4 stars because it meeded alterations.  Try making this recipe with these changes: use white or yellow cake mix, only 1 box vanilla pudding and only 1 (8 oz) container Cool Whip (everything else is the same as the recipe).  Mix and bake cake according to directions for 9x13 pan.  Let cake cool, then top with drained crushed pineapple. Mix vanilla pudding according to pkg directions, then add cream cheese and mix till smooth (be sure to mix very well to avoid lumps of cream cheese in the topping).  Fold Cool Whip, and maraschino cherries into pudding/cream cheese mixture. Spread evenly on top of pineapple.  Top cake with coconut and chopped nuts.  As written this recipe has the pineapple on top of a huge mound of pudding and Cool Whip.  This is a great recipe with these alterations.

Needed a quick easy recipe for KDG Luau. I changed it around a little to be more convenient.Made the cake and pudding, then layered according to directions. But, I got clear plastic cups, dished cake and other ingredients and layered as directed into cups. Added a cherry and orange slice on top to make a Pina Colada 'drink'. Served with a spoon. Great for a group of 5 and 6 year olds! They loved it and it put the other moms' Hawaiian desserts to shame! Thanks!

Best cake I have ever made!  I substituted some pineapple juice for some milk in the pudding and layered it between two halves of cake.

I would not recommend this recipe. It tastes okay but it calls for too much pudding and whipped topping. You cannot put all that on a cake. I only used half the amount. Not worth the effort!

This recipe was easy and tastes great.  I used a simple buttercream frosting with pina colada and rum flavoring.  They were a hit!

This cake is excellent as is>  I don't understand why people have to completely re-write a recipe.  If you don't like it as is instead of changing someone else's recipe submit your own.

Loved it.  Put cake in large tupperware dish so had lots of room to add pudding & cool whip,  etc.

I followed everyone elseâ€™s reviews and just used one box of vanilla pudding. This was more than enough pudding. This is a good recipe that is easy enough for a six year old to make.
