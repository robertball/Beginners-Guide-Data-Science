I LOVE this recipe and have made it at least a dozen times.  People offer to pay me to make them one.  Only hint I have is to increase the Bailey's to just under a 1/2 cup.  Also, leave the cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar once you have turned it off for about a half hour to cool. This will help it not to crack and then bring it to room temp before refrigerating it.  Fantastic recipe!!

I made a few changes but only because I know my personal taste.  I added a little instant coffee granules to the melted butter for the crust and I omitted the chocolate chips because I don't like chocolate in my cheesecake.  However, I thought the amount of Irish Cream in the recipe was sufficient.  I could definitely taste it - don't know if it had anything to do with the chocolate not being in there to overpower it.  And I was unsure of how it would be in texture due to the only main ingredients being cream cheese & eggs - no sour cream - but it was actually one of the best textures ever!  I took someone's idea and added a little Irish cream to the whipping cream, too.  Oh, and I did cook it at 350 for about an 55 minutes with a water bath rather than at 375.  No cracks at all, not brown at all yet it was done all the way through.  Overall, great!

This recipe is awesome!! I've made it three times already. I put in at least 1/2 cup Bailey's instead of 1/3 and substituted pecans on top instead of the chocolate chips, it looks way better this way!!

My first cheesecake ever! This was amazing. I did not change a thing except to cook it in a water bath at 350, which took a tad over an hour. Then I turned the oven off, cracked the door open, and left it alone for several hours to cool before putting in the fridge with plastic wrap over the top. Great texture, awesome flavor. The Bailey's was just the right note, and I love chocolate in my cheesecake :)

Very nice, smooth cheesecake.  A friend who can taste (and hates) alcohol in ANYTHING, liked this recipe very much (as did everyone else who tried it)!

Excellent!  Has a great Irish Creme taste, without being too overpowering.  Would also be good (and smoother) without chocolate chips.

Baked this for Valentines Day - was a hit.  I followed other reviewers advice and increased the Irish Cream to a half cup.  Was concerned about not pre-baking the crust but it turned out fine.

Fantastic cheesecake!  I added a little Irish Cream to the whipping cream when I made it for the cake topping.

This cheesecake turned out really good, my two year old came back for thirds! Since there is no such thing as unwanted Bailey's at our house, I made a batch from scratch with an Allrecipes recipe and even saved some money.

This is a great way to use up some unwanted Bailey's Irish Cream! It tastes great & pretty easy to make for a cheese cake.

It's a cheesecake that'll warm your heart - it sure did mine! The Irish Cream and chocolate chips are a wonderful combination. Both smooth and elegant.

This recipe was pretty good. The taste was AMAZING though, the Irish cream added that little something extra. Although my first attempt, i over filled the pie pan a bit, so it looked a tad bit funny. But nonetheless, it was delicious!

Nice cheesecake, but not great.  The texture wasn't smooth, kindof granular.  I also thought the cooking temperature was surprisingly high, and it ended up browned on the surface!  I took account of some earlier comments and doubled the Irish Cream, which may have been a mistake; I think I personally would have preferred a subtler hint of flavour as this was slightly overwhelming.  May also have affected the texture, of course, so will probably try it again as written...  :)
