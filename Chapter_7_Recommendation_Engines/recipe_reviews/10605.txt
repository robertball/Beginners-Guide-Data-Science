They were pretty good!  The insides are like cake and the outside is crisp.  Don't use this recipe if you are looking for chewy cookies.  I recommend adding a little (1/2 tsp. to 1 tsp.) cinnamon also for more flavor.  I agree that they were pretty pale -- don't leave them in the oven longer b/c you think they need more color b/c they'll burn!  The cinnamon adds a little color also....I bet nutmeg would work well too.  I would make them again.  They're very fast and relatively easy.

This recipe was the best Oatmeal Chocolate Chip recipe that I've ever found, although I did use 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and I left out the walnuts. I dropped the dough in very small balls and wound up with many more than anticipated.

Very tasty cookies. Flavor may be too rich for some, but not me! We sometimes substitute apple sauce for the butter to reduce the fat content. Cookies w/the apple sauce are chewier and more moist. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I noticed so many different changes were made to this recipe with varying results. I decided to stick to the original recipe and see for myself.
As it turned out i had no nuts, nor did i have milk so i omitted them. (I don't understand why milk would be listed anyway as it would thin the dough too much) Also i was using a dark baking sheet so i lowered the temperature to 350F and baked for ten minutes.  They did not go flat as others mentioned, they were crisp and golden on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside.  My whole house smells wonderful too!  This is a keeper!

Yum! I made these as bar cookies, and they were delicious! They tasted very similar to traditional chocolate chip bar cookies, but the oats gave them a nice, chunky consistency. This recipe is a keeper!

We had several problems with this recipe and eventually threw out the first two batches.  By adding a half cup of flour, we were able to save the third batch.  We added cinnamon to give a little twist and hide the additional flour needed to keep the dough together.  The cookies were very thin and flat, quick to burn on the edges and not cook in the middle. They stuck to the pan and the taste was lack-luster.  I will not recommend this  to someone I considered a friend.

I too had to add more flour to the recipe.   I used 2 2/3 c.  First batch I made didn't look done and were flat.  But when I added the extra flour they turned out fine. Nothing spectacular, just fine.

Recipe was very good, but then again I am a sucker for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  I didn't add walnuts to mine, though. Like everyone said, they do look very pale when you take them out, but they get darker while cooling. And I only cooked mine for 9 minutes and they were great.

Soft, but with lots of chewy texture from the oatmeal.  I made mine larger than the recipe directed and I think that may contribute to their being nice and thick and tender.  I love oatmeal cookies with chocolate covered raisins so I used them instead of the chocolate chips and nuts.  Just a darned good, reliable, cookie jar oatmeal cookie, one to keep in your recipe box to return to over and over again.

The cookies tasted great but they looked pale even after 10 mns in the oven.  I tried to leave a batch a little longer but I ended by having burned bottom cookies.

Delish.  I sprinkled in a wee bit more flour and let the dough chill after the first batch came out a little flat.

Cookies turned out great.  Some of you complained that the cookies were pale or were flat.  Try substituting butter flavored crisco instead of butter.  It will give the cookie a browner look and because it melts at a higher temp the cookie won't spread out and flatten.

I followed the recipe pretty much with the exception of using half Crisco and half butter. I also added a half a teaspoon of baking powder. AMAZING cookies. I baked at 350 for 12 minutes. YUMMY!

Needed way more flour and the taste was awful.  I threw away the first batch and the dough to look for a better recipe.
The cookies melted in the oven, turning flat with burnt edges.  I was expecting cookies, not burnt tortillas with chocolate chunks. :(

I liked the texture of these (thin, crispy edges, slightly chewy centre); but they seemed to lack something in flavour as a few other reviewers noted as well.  I can't put my finger on it..maybe needs more vanilla...regardless, next time I will try another recipe.

Yum! I made a few substitutions and additions. 1 jar zucchini apple cinnamon baby food (large jar presidents choice organic) and 4 heaping tbsp organic applesauce (these two pureed measured 1cup) in place of butter. i also coarsely chopped a can of chickpeas and added in at the end with the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (I pulsed the nuts and  chickpeas together in my food processor until they were a crumbly texture. I also added 1tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. I had no brown sugar so I used 3/4 cup sugar cane sugar in place of both the white and brown sugar-they turned out plenty sweet enough. I also added 3tbsp of milled flax at the end. Because of the addition of chickpeas there was enough to make two trays. I only had to cook them for 25min. My kids (and my husband) loved them!! This is a healthy and protein packed version! They are however a bit cakey from the addition of a fruit and veg puree. Enjoy

The cookies taste OK. I used whole wheat flour and added cocoa powder to make them chocolate chocolate chip cookies. They cooked in 10 minutes but did not go flat. Not sure why.

My family and I love these cookies.  We can't eat enough of them.  Based on the reviews I read and personal preferences I changed the recipe a tiny bit: I doubled the vanilla to equal 2 teaspoons and for the flour I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was like another similar lactation cookie recipe I have made. I only modified it by using less, much less, chocolate chips. Not by choice but that's what I had available. I love these because they aren't super sweet. Andit makes a ton of cookies that lasts us days.

Did NOT like this recipe at all! Too much butter not enough flour. They turned out like flat crispy pancakes. I added 1/2 a cup of flour to try to fix them. It somewhat worked but they were pale in color. Totally disappointed :(

I made the bar cookie version.  They turned out crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside.  Super yummy.  The only variation I made to the recipe was using pecans instead of walnuts.  Will make these again!

Delicious! My husband said these are the best cookies I ever made. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

Easy to make, hard to mess up. I added a bunch of stuff to mine. Craisens, coconut, butterscotch, mixed nuts, etc. total was still 3 cups of add-ins. They came out great - kind of like a trail mix cookie!

I give this 3 stars because the batter was runny and the first batch (made exactly as listed) all ran together on the cookie sheet as they baked.  The remaining batter, I added about 1/2 cup flour to and they baked up much better.

This is actually the second time we have made this amazing recipe. It's like the childhood recipe I made in 4-H that was misplaced years ago. The first time, we followed the recipe exactly as written, and they were divine. This time, I realized I was out of all-purpose flour, so I used whole wheat flour instead. They turned out PERFECTLY! We couldn't tell the difference, and it made them a little bit healthier too! My kids were actually eating the batter right from the bowl, and the texture of the cookies turned out exactly the way we like them!

These were pretty good, I definitely recommend making small cookies (because bigger ones tend to burn on the bottom and stay uncooked in the center)and lowering the baking temp to 350 degrees. They tasted kind of eggy, but my boyfriend liked them a lot. I wasn't crazy about them, and I probably won't make them again.

I've made this recipe twice now, both having very different results. The first time I used half butter and half crisco as some of the other reviews had mentioned.The cookies turned out cake like inside with the outside crispy (which is the way I LOVE them :)) This last time I made the recipe, it was according to the directions (only because I forgot that I originally did the substitution)and my cookies turned out very flat and crispy. So, depending on your tastes, this recipe can be modified to accomodate everyone's preferences.

I'm at high altitude (5,000ft.), so I baked them for the 9 minutes listed and the second batch was 10. They looked a bit brown, not to pale. Keep the spoon heaping when you put them on the pan, the smaller scoops I used were flatter. I also used half butter and half butter Crisco. I added a little bit of flour (just heaped the measured amount) but it still seemed sticky, so I added a touch more. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg and a little more than a sprinkle of cinnamon. I split the batch in half in the end and added the chocolate chips to one and raisins to the other. Good taste. Might use this one again, might try another.

Disappointed at this recipe.  First 2 batches came out flat as a pancake and slightly burnt.  I baked them less time than called for.  Had to add more flour to make them come out decently.

My family really enjoyed these cookies.  I did add a dash of cinnamon as other reviewers have suggested and was careful to not over bake.  The cookies didn't turn out the prettiest but I loved the chewy texture.

I made these cookies following every detail and not adding anything or changing the measurements and they turned out great! the only thing I did differently is that I did not add any nuts. They perfect, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I would definatley make these again.

My cookies stuck to the pan, if you make these defintitely grease your pans, they burned around the edges and were raw in the middle, I could tell before baking the dough needed more flour, telling myself to stick to the recipe was a waste next time I will try my favorite chocolate chip recipe adding oatmeal to that

Easy and Delicious!
I made the BARS option and followed recipe EXACTLY as written. I used REAL butter, pressed the dough into an ungreased 9x13 pan and baked for 35 min. at 375. They were perfect, thick bars chock full of nuts and chocolate. Three of us practically ate half a pan in a day! I already shared it with friends and relatives and plan to use it a lot!! Be sure to use quick cooking oatmeal NOT instant, maybe that is why some people had problems.

I baked 4 cookies and put the rest of the dough in the freezer so I could have cookies for the grandkids at a moment's notice. These cookies did not turn out flat at all as some other reviewers suggested. Mine were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I baked them for 9 minutes. I would definitely make these again. ***They also bake up quite nicely after the dough has been frozen.

the dough tasted divine, the end product was flat, crispy and a waste of products. too much butter, adding flour just made them more bland and a bit less flat.

i substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c butter, cut back the sugar by about 1/3 c, cut chocolate chips to 1.25 c. it definitely tasted healthy (boo) but since i eat them semi-frozen, i can't really tell. edit: i also tried 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c butter, only 1/3 c sugar, 1 c chocolate chips, and 1 c wheat flour. they come out the same shape they go into the oven. they taste more like pancakes, but i kind of like that.

Tried this recipe and I really liked it! I did change a few things because when I made recipe as is, the cookies came out flat and a bit too salty. The second time I added more flour- 2 and a half cups- and less salt. I also put the recipe in the fridge for awhile before cooking. Then my cookies came out amazing! My brother ate them all in two days!

These cookies are wonderful!  Followed the directions exactly except added a little more chocolate than required and they turned out great.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Very good recipe, this was the first time i made these cookies. I had to add more flour because the batter was too wet and i also lowered the oven down to 350, i burned my first batch at 375. Overall with the minor changes that i made they turned out great!

Very good recipe! I used slightly more brown sugar and slightly less white, and substituted half of the chocolate chips for dried blueberries. I also added some flax that I had kicking around, and baked at 360 for 11 minutes or so. The batter is also delicious - I think I'll make it without the eggs and scoop some uncooked batter into vanilla ice cream for a simple dessert.

SO!  I did not have chocolate chips or walnuts, much to my surprise, when I threw together all of the ingredients besides.  But it all worked out! nyahaha.  I put in two bananas, about 1 1/2 cups of salted cashews, and about a half cup of butterscotch chips.  They were a hit! ;)  I had one of my friends say she normally does not like oatmeal cookies, but she had three of these, haha. Oh, and they were giant, too, so I had to bake them for about 15 minutes.  (I'm being told right now, too, that they were "super delicious," haha.)

I chose to make these as cookie bars.  I stuck to the recipe except I added more chocolate chips and 2 TBSP of half n' half because I had it on hand.  I cooked them for about 40 minutes and they came out perfect.  The flavor and consistency were excellent.  The batter was softer than traditional cookie dough but I found that made it easier on me to stir in all the oatmeal and chips!  KEEPER.

This was a good, basic recipe.  I'll be honest, I miss my old one that was written on a slip of paper, and I negelected to properly tuck away.  I didn't find them to go flat as others have mentioned, they just weren't anything to write home about.

These are really good cookies! They turned out wonderful.. you really do have to let them cool longer than 1 minute though.  And When you take them out they almost look undone but once they cool they are perfect!  I did add come cinnamon like some people suggested.  Worth a try, these made it to my recipe box!

Just made these for my son's camp. I followed the advice and added extra vanilla and some cinnamon and raisins too.  Very moist.  I also cut down on the sugar a little bit.  These came out great...baked them as bar cookies.

The cookies had good flavor but could have used some more cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla but the biggest issue which made them awful entirely, was the thinness of them. I came up with two solutions that will make them eatable. Refrigerate the dough for about an hour covered in wrap, then, after baking, cool for about half an hour to an hour rather than  1 minute  so they don't fall out through the middle when you scoop them off your pan. In addition, you certainly do want to grease your pan even for non-stick, because the cookies become so thin and fragile. Don't even touch them when they are warm or you'll loose the middle.

Giving a 4 star only because I know the vanilla that I forgot to add, would make them even better.  Without the vanilla they are still good!!  I just had one fresh from the oven, and mmmm mmmmm good!!  My fiance will be the real judge when he comes over though.  He asked for oatmeal chocolate chip specifically.

I made this recipe exactly as it appears, and the cookies were just fine.
They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with plenty of chocolate chips and nuts.  They certainly were popular at a gathering I toted them to - I think three tiny crumbs were left!

This is a GREAT base recipe. As it is, it's the quintessential oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. They bake up beautifully. No crunch here. Just a chewy cake-like consistency with loads of chocolate! With the dough base, the options for changing it up are limitless. Next time, I'll probably go for coconut, white chocolate, macadamia nuts and cranberry with pumpkin pie spice. Or maybe Pecan and toffee bits??? Either way, I'm sure they'll bake up as beautifully. Quick note...I used silicone baking mats and they baked for 11 minutes. Perfecctly brown all around:)

Great cookies!  My husband and son love them.  As one of the other reviewers suggested I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg - just a little, but it was a great addition.

Very yummy! Chewy and hearty. I made the bars and used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening because that was all I had. My kids don't like nuts so I spread the chopped nuts on the top of 1/2 of the pan of bars and gently press them in. Thanks Rosina!

My family loves these! I've run across a lot of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and they've all had cinnamon. I only like cinnamon when they're full on cinnamon cookies, not when there's just a hint of cinnamon. We love that these had NO cinnamon. They were all chocolate chip oatmeal.

I had to make a couple substitutions. I had no vanilla, so I used 1/2 TBS Kahlua. I only had 1 C white chocolate chips, so I added 2 TBS organic Cacao powders for contrast.

These cookies were extremely moist and I have no complaints except for one. There were too many oats . I suggest adding  3/4  of  the amount you're using. I will make these again.

This is pretty close to my favorite recipe in a church cookbook. I add two teaspoons of vanilla and am not strict on oatmeal. Oftentimes I add a little less- 2 cups. These are so tasty with a glass of cold milk! Taste of home.

I just made these for my husband (who has a wicked sweet tooth) and he loved them. I did make them larger so I had to bake them longer, but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. (I am gluten-free, so am going by his judgement). I will make them for him again.  I may add a bit of cinnamon next time..

I made this recipe with a couple of modifications.. I used all natural locally made honey instead of the white sugar, and use one cup of chocolate and one cup of butterscotch chips. They turned out awesome!

I found this recipe a couple years ago and have been using it ever since. Everyone who tries my cookies loves them (even if they don't usually like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies). After experimenting with this recipe, a few things I do differently are: melt the butter (but not completely), use about 3/4 of the salt that it calls for, don't use the walnuts, make the cookies a little bigger (and cook them for 12 minutes), and let them sit on the hot cookie sheet for 4 minutes before letting them cool.

Following the recipe completly it turned out a nice looking cookie after the 10 minutes baking. After cooling, and tasting them, I realize that it's way to much chocolate for this cookie. Defiantly cutting down on the chocolate chips next time. For now were calling this cookie, "Death by Chocolate!"

We love this recipe..My husband took some to work and now everyone wants the recipe. I did change it just a bit to use up what I had in the pantry..I put half mini chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips in and used old fashion rolled oats and added a little more pecans as my husband loves nuts.He said they taste like granola cookies.They taste great with ice cold milk or a cup of coffee in the morning.

We made this recipe & loved it...made sure to use large flake oats...not quick oats...cookies were chewy & not flat at all! We added an extra cup of chocolate chips instead of the nuts.

Love these cookies!!! Chewy in the middle crunchy on the outside. I used what I had on hand as far as chips go, which was 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips. The rest of the recipe was followed as directed. Super yummy!!!!

Followed recipe but for omitting milk (saw no need), adding 1/2 tsp baking powder & substituting pecans for walnuts - cookies were perfect. Baking time & temp was spot on. Love the amount of nuts & chocolate chips called for. Will definitely make again.

Flat. Flat. Flat. I followed this recipe exactly  and my first dozen cookies came out super flat, pale, and would not hold their shape.  I added another cup of flour to the remaining cookie dough and they rose a bit higher and held their shape. But they were pretty bland. I won't be making this recipe again :/

made the bar cookie version as well as the drop cookie version, both great.  On the bar cookie version I subbed whole wheat flour for half the flour called for and used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar and the result was delicious!

I make bar cookies with this recipe, and they are fabulous! Everyone raves about them.  The only changes I make to this recipe are in the goodies.  I like my cookies with lots of textures--I add a half cup of raisins and reduce the nuts and chocolate chips so that I can add white chocolate chips too.  I've seen the reviews about adding flour, but it definitely doesn't need it for the bars.  Love these.

I thought this recipe was excellent! I used a little less oats and chocolate chips and instead put in cranberries. Also baked it for 8 minutes b/c 10 burnt (but didn't destroy) the first batch. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I was very disappointed with the way these cookies turned out!  It tasted good but if you are planning on bringing it some place, don't!  These were not presentable whatsoever.  They came out incredibly flat and were hard to scrape off without breaking the cookie apart!

These are delicious, but not pretty at all. They spread out which makes them hard to keep together when removing them from the pan. They definitely need to sit for at least a minute before you try to remove them!

I made the cookie bars and cooked at 30 minutes and the bottom and edges burned. They burn quickly and I could smell them burning at 15. They didn't taste that oatmeal-y...

Flavor = b +
Directions/Technique = c-

Flavor to be made 'perfect' (in my palette's opinion):
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup more oats
1 teaspoon cinnamon
No nuts for me:)

Technique changes:
1) sift dry ingredients together--no flat cookies that way
2) I made the cookies and the bar version (in a 8x8 glass), the bar version turned out amazing and will be my 'go to version' now

i loved this recipe... but i did augment it a little. i put 1 tbsp of Kahlua in the mix and i didn't use any milk. and instead of just adding the butter, i melted it down over the stove and added like 20 chocolate chips to it. that's why my cookies are a bit darker. yummy!

I used mini chocolate chips and left out the walnuts (not necessary at all!) I recommend using the mini chips for those that are not necessarily fans of oatmeal cookies.  This way you are getting more chocolate taste than oatmeal taste and are still getting a healthier cookie.  They tasted great!

I love these best when they are raw!  But they are great cooked too!  These will be my "go to" recipe for Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies!  They flatten out and are crispy on the edges with a little bit of chewiness!  GREAT!

Gosh, what's not to like...  These cookies are fabulous!  I used dark chocolate.  The oatmeal, walnuts, and chocolate are perfectly balanced in this recipe.  (A dangerous little cookie :-)

These are a standard, oatmeal cookie.  There was nothing to ooh or aah about.  You have to give the cookie a couple of minutes to set before taking them off the pan or they will break apart, but that does make for a gooier cookie, which I do prefer.  Cinnamon is a must.

These cookies tasted great, but fell apart when I picked them up...I cooked them a little longer on the next batch and although they looked overdone, they were soft and moist in the center with a slight crisp on the outside.  They tasted even better the next day.

This recipe didn't work at all for me.  The cookies stuck to the pan, then fell apart when I tried to pry them loose.  I added some flour to the last ones to go in the oven and that helped a lot.  I'll try a different recipe the next time I make this type of cookie.

I used light butter and half splenda/half sugar to save on calories and they were still yummy!I liked the thicker, moist texture of these cookies. My husband loved them and when I brought some into work my boss ate them all up within a day and he is a super healthy eater.

I made the bars with this recipe, and they were perfect! The only thing I did differently was double the vanilla, add a dash of nutmeg, and did not add nuts. (I'm the only one in the house who eats them) I'll be using this recipe again, definitely.

Great cookies!  I used dark chocolate (60% cocoa) chips and omitted the nuts.  This recipe makes a nice chewy, not too sweet cookie that my family enjoyed.

I try to cut back on my sugar so made some minor changes.

I used splenda baking sugar instead of gradulated sugar and only added one cup of chocolate chips & used dark chocolate instead and added one cup of raisons. I also added 2 spoons of vanilla  & cooked on 350 for 10 minutes. These cookies were amazing.

I love this recipe because it is the first oatmeal chocolate chip recipe that I have found where I was able to use an egg substitute and still have moist cookies as a result!

My daughter has an egg allergy so we use Ener-G egg replaces which tends to suck all the moisture out of things.  I usually add mroe liquid to compensate but forgot to this time and they turned out great!

We really love these cookies.  I didn't include the nuts (because I didn't have any) and it was still a great recipe. It'll become a family favorite.

I skipped the walnuts on this one and added two tablespoons of applesauce. They turned out very well but if using applesauce I would recommend greasing the cookie sheet as they are more likely to stick!

The cookies are good (if you like very rich chocolate, I used Ghiradelli 60% chips and they always taste excellent).  I didn't think they were great... the consistency seems tough when you bite into one, but perhaps it is just my oven!

Excellent cookies!  I have made these both with and without the nuts.  Either way, they're awesome.  Definitely not a wimpy cookie.  Yummy and hearty!

After reading the reviews, I decided to change a couple of things, I switched the measurements of the brown and white sugars and added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. Absolutely the best, just what we had envisioned on our tastebuds. Light and crispy and not gooey in the center. Thanks!

This was a good standard recipe. The consistency after baked was amazingly chewey. Even the ones I overcooked stayed soft! I substituted golden rasins for the chocolate chips, but I found that the flavor of the cookie itself seemed to overpower the flavor of the rasins.

I tried this recipe but with some changes. First I used half butter and half crisco and used dark brown sugar instead. I also used a combo of milk choc, semi-sweet choc, and white choc chips, craisins, and chopped pecans for add-ins.  They were the rave!

My husband LOVED these cookies! And he's a little picky at times. I made them kinda big so it took a little longer than 10 minutes in the oven, but they were very, very good!!

I was going to add my awesome recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies to this site, not remembering where I got the recipe from. Then I wanted to make sure there were no duplicates. Well, THIS is the recipe that I love! I won't make any other oatmeal cookie. I like these because they don't flatten out. Tastes great!!

These were just about the best a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie can be. I was out of regular chocolate chips and walnuts, so i used mini chocolate chips and no walnuts. I am going to try the bar cookies next!

This is a good basic recipe. We loved it, especially the kids. I did not have any problems with this recipe. We followed the recipe exactly, baked them on a stone for about 15 minutes, and they came out perfect. They were nice and brown. Thank you for the recipe.
