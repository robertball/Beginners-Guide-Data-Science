I would give this recipe 100 stars if I could!!! I am in love with McDonalds sweet tea.  I would go every morning after I dropped the kids off at school and buy 2 large teas with no ice.  I would grab a drink here and there!! I would crave it if I didn't have any left!! Well sorry Mcdonalds!! You have met your match!! I double this recipe and make a gallon of sweet joy!! I love the baking soda trick.  It really does keep the tea clear and not bitter.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

The baking soda is the key ingredient in this recipe to make a smooth tea. It helps to cut the bitter taste that you can get from tea.  It's really refreshing and  for me it has the right amount of sweetness.  Thx.

As if this recipe needed ANOTHER 5 star rating, but I couldn't help myself. I agree with another reviewer that the baking soda DOES take the bitterness out of the recipe. I had stopped making iced tea for that very reason, and then I found this recipe. It's absolutely delicious. For those of you who see the baking soda in this recipe and frown in curiosity, turn that frown upside down. The baking soda makes it delicious (and is necessary in my opinion)! Now, I will say that I did not use quite as much cool water as the recipe calls for. I think I stopped at about 4 cups. But the strength of your tea is such a personal taste thing, so I would recommend that as you're adding the water, give it a good stir after the first few cups and taste it and see whatcha think. As for the sugar, I used exactly what the recipe called for (keep in mind I used less water) and it tasted perfect. Not too sweet, because I don't like sweet, sweet tea. This recipe can be tweaked to suit any taste. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. It's absolutely delicious! Try it...once you do, you won't have it any other way!

Some of my family members are not sweet tea drinkers, they prefer their iced tea unsweetened so I tried the pinch of baking soda in unsweetened tea and it seemed to be just as effective at smoothing the bitterness and preventing it from getting cloudy. Thanks for the tip!

A lovely recipe. I used 1 cup of sugar (If you've ever had the "Tradewinds" brand of iced tea, then you'll know what I mean when I say I prefer "super sweet"  to simply "sweet". The baking soda worked its magic even better than I thought it would. I also substituted ice for some of the cold water which speeded up the cooling process. This will make you feel like you're sitting on your wrap around porch in a white rocking chair, even if you live in the city without so much as a patio.

I made this yesterday for my husband, as he's big on sweet tea. Yes. Thumbs up. He approves! I'll be making the sweet tea like this from now on. EDITED: This also works with Splenda and agave nectar!

Yey! No more cloudy tea! And all it took was a pinch of baking soda?  So clear you can see right through it. Using 1/2 cup of Splenda was the perfect sweetness for us and I thank you cookincode3 for sharing your great tip!

I love this recipe! My man is from Ga and misses his sweet tea.  This did the trick and thinks it is the BEST tea he has had.  I double the recipe using 4 family sized tea bags and only add 10 cups of water after the 1 1/2 cups of sugar dissolves.  He says its the BEST sweet tea ever.

Pouring boiling water into a glass pitcher (even a "heat-proof" one) is a recipe for disaster.  The glass will crack/shatter.  The best thing to do is to pour it into a plastic container first and then put it in the glass pitcher after it has cooled.

Following this recipe exactly I make this daily in my household. To keep this on hand I make the concentrate, freeze it in a container, pop it out then store it in the freezer gallon size ziplock bags. Whenever I run out I just place the frozen concentrate in a gallon container and add the 6 cups of water and WHOLAH!! Simple and Tasty!!

Very good tea with no bitter aftertaste!  I only let mine steep 10 minutes.  I subbed 1/4 cup of organic agave in place of the sugar.  I will be making this again soon.

I used about 1/4 t of baking soda and it was neither too much or little for the full recipe. It really did take away the bitterness and made a really nice sweet tea. I used the full 3/4 c of sugar and did not find it to be too sweet.

Well, I can see where all the 5 star ratings come from!  This stuff really is good, so good you could bottle it and sell it!  I'm the unsweetened iced tea drinker in the house so that's saying something. I'm going to try the baking soda trick with the unsweetened iced tea as well.  My husband loves this iced tea - Thanks for the recipe we'll put it to a lot of use over the summer months!

This tea is great!  My husband is from Virginia and loves sweet tea, and he is giving this rave reviews.  I like that it tastes like tea (it isn't just syrupy tasting) but is never bitter, even after a few days in the fridge.  If you like mint iced tea, just put several fresh-picked mint leaves in to steep with the tea bags.  It is so refreshing on a hot day!   I know others increased the sugar to one cup, but the recipe is really perfect as written; sometimes I even use a tiny bit less sugar.  This tea is now  a summer staple in our house!

This is my go-to recipe for iced tea; the baking soda really eliminates any bitterness. If you decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and replace the cool water at the end with lemonade, you have a delicious tea lemonade, best with black or green tea, in my opinion. If you replace the cool water at the end with milk, you have an incomparable tea latte -- you must try it with chai or earl gray! Absolutely amazing.

Just another member giving a 5 star review!  I used 1/2 cup of Splenda and it was sweet enough for me.  Love the Baking Soda trick.

For those of you who would like a precise measurement for what a "Pinch" is - it's 1/16th of a teaspoon or half of the 1/8th teaspoon.
1/8 teaspoon = Dash
1/16 teaspoon = Pinch
1/32 teaspoon = smidgen

Very good recipe.  I do not like my ice tea getting watered down when I put it over ice.  So I freeze some of the tea in old fashion ice cube trays and pour the tea over "tea cubes."  Flavor stays just as I prefer it - like tea.

this is the best sweet tea ever, thats what my 3 year old said. i used 2 family size tea bags since that what i had. i didnt pour the hot tea into my glass jar, i was afraid it would break. so i boiled 2 cups of water in a large pot, removed from the heat and added the baking soda & tea bags covered and let sit for 15 mins. then i added the sugar and when it was desolved i added the 6 cups of cold water.  then i poured it into my glass jug.

Iced Tea has always been a staple for me in the spring and summer months, even though I have always hated that bitter aftertaste.  Well, the pinch of baking soda takes care of that!  Thank you, thank you for making my favorite drink even better!  I add fresh lemon slices to the pitcher (and sometimes lime slices, too).

This might be the only thing I drink for the rest of my life, except for the occasional beer. I was hesitant because I like lemon (or lemonade concentrate) in my iced tea, but now I'm a convert. Thanks so much! (I followed the recipe as directed, but put in about a 1/2 tsp soda)

The best sweet tea I have ever had. We were curious as to how much of a difference the pinch of baking soda would make. To our surprise, it makes all the difference in the world. So smooth, absolutely no bitterness and no cloudy tea! Perfect. We have been using this recipe for a while now and I make a double batch a couple of times a week. It's always gone in one day with this crowd. Thanks for sharing!

Being born and raised in the deep South, I had to laugh when I read that this was a "Southern" sweet tea posted by someone from New York and now living in Seattle, Washington (No offense meant at all; just ironic). Nobody I know from the south has ever heard of putting baking soda in tea but I was intrique enough to try it.  Turns out, it doesn't change the taste at all.  The result is just like the tea we make in south Mississippi! I'm not sure what its purpose is in this recipe but my 83 year old mother said her mama would occasionally put baking soda in fresh beans to help keep kids from getting a tummy ache. (Who knows.)  Either way, this tea is very good and very "Southern," with or without the baking soda.  Thanks cookincode3.

Amazing! This will be in my fridge forever, I LOVE iced tea! Also, for those inexperienced cooks who don't know, a pinch is about 1/16 tsp so don't over/under do it!

Just thought I'd share that the longer you let tea steep the more bitter it gets. That is why you should only steep tea for 3-5 minutes.  Any longer and you get bitter tea.

So I just made the tea doubling the recipe to make a gallon. It's the best I have had since my grandmother stopped making sweet tea. Beautiful clear red color. I did make a few changes -- insted of the individual tea bags I used 2 gallon sized bags and only 8 cups cold water and ice to fill the rest of the way - no patientce to wait for it to chill in our house lol  BTW dont forget the lemon wedge it is even better than I thought it could be

I am a Virginia girl, and I love authentic southern sweet tea. This recipe rivals many of the sweet teas I have ever had!
I used my Iced Tea Maker for this recipe, with a few minor adjustments, it came out fantastic.

The recipe (as is) makes about 2 quarts. My machine makes 3 quarts. To accomodate, I adjusted the baking soda up by a half of a pinch,used 3 family sized tea bags (equivalent to 9 regular tea bags), and increased the sugar to 1 cup + 3 tablespoons.  

If you use an iced tea maker, just sprinkle the baking soda at the bottom of the pitcher, add the recommended amount of ice based on the amount you are making, and once the tea has finished brewing all you will need to do is add the sugar, stir, and enjoy! 

Thank you for such a great recipe.

I make sweet tea on a daily basis in our home. Its delicious and refreshing. Just a note...when placing tea bags in the boiling water, anything over 9 minutes burns the tea leaves and makes it bitter. I steep them for exactly 9 minutes and its perfect tea every time. the pinch of baking soda will take the bitterness out, yes. Also, by placing the hot tea in the fridge, that makes it cloudy. Try pouring it over ice cubes to make up the water volume.

Not particularly caring for this recipe. It's a bit inefficient whn one can just leave tea bags in a gallon of water in the sun for 45 mins, add sugar, lemon and ice.

Yep its McDonald's tea although I had to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I've also made this using Splenda and it works just fine. Do yourself a favor though and don't skip the baking soda, it keeps the tea clear and cuts out the bitterness often times associated with tea.

I can now drink ice tea again!!! I have never heard of adding baking soda, but after reading the reviews I figured I might as well try it. It worked!!! I'm happy because I absolutely LOVE ice tea--just hate the bitterness that often accompanies it :) 

The only thing I changed was I doubled the recipe to equal a gallon, but only used a cup of sugar. That's just enough sweetness for me :)

From all the good reviews, no one probably needs to hear mine to help them decide whether or not to make this, but here it is anyway. This tea is outstanding. I scaled the recipe up to 3 quarts (12 U.S. servings) and used two family size Luzianne iced tea bags instead of nine little ones. Great recipe!

I have lived in the South for almost 25 years and never learned to make iced tea. It would always be cloudy and bitter no matter what I did. Finally I did it! I made iced tea and it's really good!

Not that this recipe needs another 5-star rating...I love iced tea, but am reluctant to order it at restaurants or make it at home because it is so often bitter. Well...not any more! While a little too sweet for me as written, this recipe makes the smoothest-drinking glass of iced tea on Earth! I have now adjusted the amount of sugar downward to suit my taste buds and get a consistently wonderful result. Thanks, cookincode, for this wonderful recipe!

Great b. soda trick - love the tea, but I prefer to cut the sugar in half.  This recipe tastes just like McD's Sweet Tea, which I always order 50/50 sweet and unsweetened.

This is a huge hit!  I made this for a SoCal gathering of AR Buzzers this last Saturday.  I used Earl Grey Tea perfectly flavored with natural bergamot.  I followed the directions to a "T"!  Who could have guessed what a little pinch--and I mean pinch--of baking soda can do!  Perfection in a glass!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Love this recipe!  I add in 1/4 cup of lemon juice at the end and it's PERFECTION... way better than the bottled high fructose corn syrup iced teas.  So easy, too!  UPDATE 2/7/13 - If you love this sweet tea, then you absolutely have to try it with green tea!  Just made it this way today (including the 1/4 cup lemon juice) and it tastes so similar to those bottled citrus green tea drinks.  YUM!!!

The baking soda really does make the tea nice and smooth--definitely no bitterness. I used Lipton iced tea bags and think 3/4 cup sugar is a tad too sweet...next time I'll probably use 1/2. Great stuff. *UPDATE* I just followed this recipe exactly using Tazo Passion Tea bags. It is EXACTLY like Starbucks sweetened passion tea, except a much better deal -- and that makes it all the more amazing! DEFINITELY TRY IT!

I knew this was a recipe for "sweet tea", but I honestly wasn't sure what "sweet tea" tasted like, having never had it before.

For my taste, this tea was far too sweet.  It had a nice flavour to it (I used Early Grey tea), but much too sweet.

Still giving 4 stars, as I can't rightly downgrade a "sweet tea" for being sweet.  lol

But, if I try this again, I will cut the sugar down by about 1/2.

I made it for the first time last night.  I doubled the recipe so I have plenty of tea, but I have already had several glasses.  Very good!  I've always wondered why my tea never tasted as good as many restaurant teas, but now it is!  I live in Hawaii, where it is very hard to find sweet tea...even McDonald's doesn't have it here.  Doesn't matter now that I can make it myself!

This tea is really good.  I think the baking soda really makes the difference, I was very surprised it wasn't bitter.  I do reduce the sugar, though to about 1/3 cup.

mmmm, mmmmm, mmmm, mmmmmm and again, mmmmm. I am a Yankee born and bred but I have spent quite a bit of time in Atlanta and this is IT. Southern sweet tea at its best. I had heard about using baking soda to make clear iced tea and it sounded odd to me but just a tiny pinch yields a crystal clear tea with no discernible flavor. Adjust the sweetness after the first batch if you want to but try it first as written. It really is a treat.

Although I have always made a good tea, I gave this a try and switched brands as well. Lipton has always been a go-to for me, but I went and bought Luzianne before making this recipe. The result was unbelievably astonishing and thats not a lie! This is the kind of Southern House Wine you want to put in a fancy glass pitcher and serve the right way! Thanks a bunch for sharing! Makes living up north just a tad sweeter, lol.

I used green tea,  it's good!   Can't believe I didn't think of this myself.     Baking soda nuetralizes  the acid!    That's the key, thanks for posting older recipes, I wouldn't have gone looking for this.

FINALLY!!!  I am originally from Tennessee and my Midwestern husband was always dissapointed that I didn't know how to make a good batch of sweet tea.  I experimented sooo many times and it always ended up cloudy and bitter.  If I added more sugar to cut the bitterness it ended up super-duper-cavity-sweet.  I always wondered what the secret was and now I know...BAKING SODA!  I just had my first few swigs of a fresh batch after trying this recipe and I seriously could not believe my taste buds.  Wait till my husband tries this, I'm a true Southern Woman now!  (I don't think I'll share the little baking soda trick with my friends, I'll let them wonder what my secret ingredient is! *evil laugh*)

The best.  Garnish with fresh mint and a lemon slice or use frozen cubes of lemon juice.  I rimmed the glass with Cat Hill's Minty Sugar, sooooo good on a hot day!

Great tip about the baking soda!  It really does work.   Have made this many, many times with different combinations (stronger/weaker, sweeter/not so sweet, etc.).  This worked the best for us ... 1/8 tsp baking soda, 5 Red Rose tea bags, 1/4 c honey, same amounts of water and steeped for 15 minutes.   MMMMM perfect!  Thanks cookincode3 for sharing!

This is my absolute favorite sweet tea recipe!  Sometimes I add a few slices of fresh ginger to my batch of sweet tea.  I have also substituted two of the tea bags for flavored tea bags, such as peach to make a delicious batch of flavored sweet tea!

I have made this recipe lots of times and it is my go-to recipe! My husband prefers his tea unsweetened so I just use 2 tablespoons of the sugar to counteract any bitterness the tea might have. My son likes the sweetened tea. Perfect either way!

This beats any prepared mix I've tried. I agree with others that said the baking soda is essential for taking away that bitterness. It was a tad on the sweet side for me but everyone else in my family thought it was perfect! From this transplant to the South...Thank You for teaching me the secret to Smooth Southern Sweet Tea!

It's not that it didn't taste good, but it was missing something. I only made half the recipe but fell short on the sugar (used 1/8 cup, maybe slightly more) so perhaps it lacked the the sweetness of 'sweet' tea (which I have never tried, I may add. They do not sell this at McDonald's in Canada- I work there) and maybe some lemon may do some good on cutting back the overly strong tea taste. I want my iced to taste like there's tea in there, but not like plain black to left on the counter that got cold. I'm going to give this recipe another chance when I have more sugar and add lemon wedges; then let it sit a few hours and see how it turns out.

Here in East Tennessee, folks can be downright snobby about their sweet tea.  And I've never made a pitcher that I felt confident serving to guests...  Until now!  THANKS A MILLION!  No more store-bought for us!  Not sure of the kitchen science behind it, but the pinch of baking soda does the trick and as long as I follow the recipe exactly, my sweet tea is perfect every time and a pitcher never makes it through the day!

I have made this recipe so many times in the past week, I've lost count. We love it. No other recipes I've tried for iced or sweet tea have been this consistently good. I must say that 6 tea bags made it a bit strong, so I cut back to 4 and it's perfect. I think I read somewhere that Canadian tea bags are 'bolder' than American? Anyhow, I brew it in my 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup, then top it up with the 6 cups of cold water, then into a plastic pitcher in the fridge. It does not last long in our house! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent solution for bitter tea.  I always have a jug of this tea in the fridge, make it in my 8-cup Pyrex measuring cup and don't have to worry about breakage.  For those concerned about caffeine, I use decaffeinated green tea bags and never have a problem if we drink this at dinner time,

I grew up on sweet tea and make at least a gallon a day, usually more. I just wanted to suggest, if you are anything like me and don't like to add ice to your tea, as it tends to water it down, then when mixing, add ice. This will eliminate having to add ice or to wait for it to get cold. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I am a Southern lady from Tennessee.  My mom did not make any kind of tea, but I loved tea.  After getting married my husband and I would visit a friend.  His mother made the best tea and I could never get enough of her tea.  I watched her and learned.  She used the baking soda.  For years I did too, but somewhere in the past 40 years I stopped and then started buying store made tea. Being as I am diabetic, the sugar went away a long time ago, too.  I calculated my tea consumption a few months ago and learned I was spending $25 to $30 a month on Splenda sweetened tea.  Pot of boiling water use to be the way; however, now I am using an electric tea maker set a little past medium-strength-brew, pinch of BAKING SODA, 6 Louisann tea bags, 1/2 cup of Splenda, add my cold water and I am home again.  I never knew what the baking soda's part played in southern tea, but "I now know what's been missin in my Southern Tea." So to all my family and friends. When I make your tea from now on, a pinch of baking soda is going to make it better.  Thanks for listing.

Simple and very easy recipe.  I did not add the sugar as some of my family prefer to drink it without.  I will certainly be using this recipe again.

Not being from the south, I can honestly say that while I have always liked iced tea, I never LOVED it.  Last year, I tried some real southern iced tea while in New Orleans and was instantly smitten.  This little secret makes it so much like the southern iced tea I experienced, it has made drinking iced tea at home very enjoyable and I always try and keep a cold pitcher of it handy in the summertime.  I use splenda or stevia in replacement of sugar to keep the calories down, but it is just personal preference.

Ok, I had to create a membership just to rate this.  I don't drink tea, I've always wanted to for the health benefits but I've always hated the taste.  This was great!  Thank you so much for posting this.

The iced tea normally drank in my part of Canada usually has lemon in it. I thought I would look for something different. I tried this recipe and we all really enjoy it. I will make this again. I cut back on the sugar and still like it. Thanks for sharing.

I have never really liked "dirty water" before, but this recipe changed my mind!  I thought 3/4 cup of sugar was a little much (I used two family size teabags for 2 quarts), but next time I will use 1/2 cup of sugar or Splenda.

This was really strong, a bit too much for my liking. I ended up adding some more water and sugar to balance it out, but it's just not getting drank. I think maybe we're just picky tea-drinkers though! :)

After moving from Texas to Pennsylvania I've been missing some good sweet tea and BBQ. I tried this recipe out along with one of the pulled pork recipes I found on here and I felt like I was back home. The tea has a great taste and I will definitely be making it again.

Absolutely the best sweet tea recipe!  I don't boil the water, but instead I make Sun Tea!  I start with warm water and then let it sit out in the sun all day to brew, I will no longer buy Iced Tea at the store!

This is by far the most refreshing tea I've ever tried! I would have never thought that baking soda would play such an important role in great tea.I used Lipton tea bags and fell in love! I wonder if I can use the same trick on green tea? Thanks for sharing!

I love this tea! I almost didn't try it because of all the references to McDonald's sweet tea, which I don't like at all. (Watery, not very sweet, very little tea flavor... Maybe it's made differently in my part of the country, or my McDonald's makes it terrible?) I had trouble getting the sugar to dissolve, so now I boil the water and split it, one half to steep the tea, the other to dissolve the water. It turns out strong and sweet!

Lovin' the baking soda trick... my daughter has me making this every morning... she loves the recipe, but I find personally that 1/4 cup sugar is plenty, and then I'm tempted to throw in a 6 oz. can of lemonade concentrate to boot! (lol) Thanks for sharing... keeps her off the darned soda, so that's a big plus too!

We used this as a simple guideline for our tea. The baking soda trick was extremely helpful! We used 2 cold tea bags and 2 quarts of water which we steeped for 3 minutes. We added a little less than 1/4 cup of sugar and had the perfect ice cold sweet tea! No fuss here :)

This is a really good sweet tea, almost as good as McDonald's. I left the tea bags in longer than 15 mins, but by mistake. Next time I will leave the bags in for 10-15 mins and I think that will make it even better.

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as submitted but it can be (and i have) adjusted to your personal preference.  I had stopped making iced tea for my husband because I could never figure out why it was always bitter.  I never knew baking soda was they key!  Thanks for clueing me in!

This recipe has made a sweet tea lover out of me.  I have never liked iced tea with any flavor or sweetener in it but while in Alabama this past winter visiting family I decided to try the sweet tea, it was okay but after returning home and trying it I decided I would stick to my non sweetened tea.  My children however asked my to make sweet tea for them so I tried this recipe and absolutely loved it.  It is not too sweet and not bitter at all like some tea is.  I will definately be making this repeatedly, especially with summer coming.  Thank you for offering this recipe.

YUM!! I don't drink sweet tea, but my southern husband loves it. I decided to make him some today and found this recipe. I used an all-natural sugar substitute (I can't talk myself into drinking pure sugar :P) and it turned out AMAZING. Thank you for sharing this recipe, especially since it exposes the secret of baking soda. I'll be making more as my in-laws are coming to town next week.

i actually added a bit more baking soda than the recipe called for because the one i originally made was VERY bitter. Overall, however, a wonderful recipe.

Im not a tea drinker, but according to my husband it was delicious! The reason for 4 stars is because there is such a thing as too much of a good thing...drink responsibly.

I love barely-sweetened tea, but the bitterness always stood out.  Adding the baking soda (which I had never heard of) actually made the tea great!   I will make it this way from now on.

I made this for my Ice tea loving husband. I have NEVER liked hot or cold tea, but I always try it to make sure it is sweet enough for him. I thought I would try this because I always have trouble with my tea getting cloudy. I was SHOCKED when I tasted it & it was really good. I guess adding the baking soda made all the difference in the world.  I guess I am now a tea drinker!

I've been struggling all summer to get my iced tea right, and all I'd produced was too weak, too bitter or cloudy tea.  I finally decided to search for a recipe and I am very glad I found this one-- perfect!  I don't sweeten it, and it's great that way.  If, like me, you want to make it with loose tea, I found that two gently rounded tablespoonsful did the trick.

Yummy!!  The baking soda makes an incredible difference!  It was a little sweet, so I'll cut back on the sugar.  There was no bitterness to this recipe at all, and you can still taste the fact that it's homemade.

This is an excellent recipe, but I had to tone down the sweetness a bit for my own tastes. I double this recipe and only use 1/2 cup of sugar. Obviously this is better calorie-wise, as well. For those wondering what sort of tea works best, I find that a nice organic chai works amazingly well.

Great tea.  The baking soda is an awesome tip.  Though being a GRIT (girl raised in the south) this was too sweet for our house.  Next time I'll scale back to half the sugar.  I crack up at all the reviews referencing this recipe passing their "southern folk" test.  We don't all like super sweet tea nor talk with a twang.

Excellent. And if you'd like to have your tea without it being watered down as you drink it, put some of the tea into an ice cube tray, and use those ice cubes in place of regular ice cubes. As they melt, no watering down takes place!   Thank you, Cookincode3.

nice! It turned out quite well. I didn't have a glass pitcher so I boiled the water for the tea on the stove, set it on another burner, and put the tea bags and baking soda in there to steep. I put the cold water in a plastic pitcher and then poured the tea mixture into the cold water after 15 minutes. I ended up adding a little more water and a squeeze of lemon as it was a bit too strong for me. It tastes great! I didn't realize it was so easy!

I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It's a little too sweet for me, so I made a second pitcher and used 1/2 cup instead.  I also, doubled the recipe.  Much better!

I don't think it gets any more refreshing!  This is a great Sweet Tea.  I doubled the recipe using family size tea bags (6 of them) and about 1 3/4 cups of sugar.  The baking soda does the trick to keep the tea nice and smooth.  Thanks cookincode3 I'm sure we will be enjoying this all summer!

Very good tea!I make this by the gallon all the time.The baking soda will cut the bitterness but may not be necessary if the tea isn't steeped too long or the tea bags are removed gently (no pressing)when removed after brewing.

We live in the Chicagoland area and on a our trip to North Carolina to visit family last year my husband and I were in love with sweet tea.  I was so excited to find this   recipe.  He has me making it (double batches) a couple times  a  week.:)  We originally found the recipe for our annual 3rd of July party where we do pulled pork and coleslaw. It was the perfect drink to serve with the meal.

Super easy, tastes great.  Only change is that I increased sugar to 1 cup as per previous reviewer.  If you are looking for sweet tea from the South, this is not as sweet, but still is very good.

I made this tea for a southern-style dinner with fried chicken and mashed potatos, and love taking it to the park in water bottles on hot days.

I used only 4 earl grey teabags, as these seem to be very pungent, as it were. I was very happy with the recipe, and served it with a slice of lemon on the glass.

I was a bit skeptical about adding the baking soda but had I not tried it I would have missed out on the most delicious, smooth sweet tea. This portion lasts me two days. I make it all the time now. Thanks.

I grew up in Kentucky where sweet tea is a staple of life - and I must say this tea is the absolute best! That pinch of baking soda takes away any essence of bitterness.  It's delicious.

I haven't made iced tea very often so was hesitant to try but my family loved it. I think the baking soda did make a difference in the sometimes bitter tea taste. Thank you so much.

Delicious, healthy, and refreshing!!! We replaced the sugar with "sugar in the raw" instead and cut back to only 1/2 cup (added honey to sweeten it up).  Also, we added the juice of 2 fresh squeezed lemons. The recipe is exactly what it says- smooth and sweet! Thanks for posting this.

I did not like the aftertaste the baking soda left. The key to a non-bitter tea is not to let the tea bags steep too long. I made a second half-gallon: 3/4 c sugar in bottom of pitcher with 1 c HOT water stirred to make a simple syrup. Bring 2 qts water to boil, place 5 tea bags in HEAT PROOF glass bowl and pour water over them. Allow to steep for 10 minutes. Pour into the half-gallon pitcher containing the simple syrup, stir well and top with cool water to fill. Let sit to come to room temperature before putting in fridge so you don't get cloudy tea.

Surprisingly good! I was somewhat skeptical of putting baking soda in ice tea but figured that I'd give it a try. I'm very pleased that I did! I followed the recipe exactly but for a couple of procedural steps. I changed the steps a bit because I didn't have a glass pitcher and didn't feel comfortable pouring boiling water into my cheap plastic pitcher. This way made it possible to have the same great results without my worrying over whether or not my pitcher would hold up to the boiling water. Here's what I did:
First, I started with a 4 cup glass measuring cup and heated the 2 cups of water to boiling in the microwave. While that was going on, I filled a plastic pitcher with 6 cups of cool water and got the 6 tea bags ready along with the baking soda. By this time the water in the microwave was boiling and I took it out and added the pinch of baking soda directly to the measuring cup of boiling water. I then placed the 6 tea bags into the measuring cup and placed a small plate over the top of the measuring cup. I waited the 15 minutes, took out the 6 tea bags and added the 3/4 cup of sugar and stirred it inside the measuring cup for about 2 minutes to ensure that all the sugar had dissolved. I then poured the tea/sugar mixture into the plastic pitcher containing the 6 cups of cool water and stirred again for a minute or two. Then into the fridge it went until the next day. It was excellent! and had absolutely no acidity or bitterness whatsoever!

We don't have sweet tea in Canada and I love it more than iced tea.  This tastes exactly like the restaurants!  I used 4-5 cups of cool water so it is not watered down when I serve it with ice.

This recipe was both simple and sweet! I used Lipton Yellow Label Tea bags and 1/2 a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 and I found it sweet enough. I literally use to drive all the way to McDonald's in the middle of the night just to get Sweet Tea, but I'm glad I don't have to anymore because this tea is even better.

I made this with Stash Tea's "White Peach Oolang Tea" and sweetened with only 3/4 cup of Splenda, rather than sugar.  My guests absolutely RAVED about it!  Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is pretty good. I decided to add the cool water slowly and kept tasting it as I added it bc I thought the 6 cups would make it too watered down. I ended up stopping at 3Cs and it was great! I made this using Green tea and it was very tasty :)

I make this often.  The first time I mde it I sweetened it using 50/50 Splenda and sugar.  Subsequently, I make it with much less sugar or sweetener.  I make a double batch using 4c. boiling water, 16 tea bags, 2 pinches baking soda and 1/4c. splenda.  Stays clear and doesn't get bitter.  Thanks cookincode3 for the recipe. :)

I LOVE homemade tea -- unfortunately restaurants rarely get this right. I usually use a six quart pan of water and 3 teabags (2 decaf, 1 caf) steeped for 4 minutes. the tea is light and not bitter at all. still, i love the idea of being able to drink stronger tea with the addition of the baking soda. I'm going to start carrying it in a baggie and try adding it to bitter restaurant tea. Thanks so much for this hint!

Mama always put baking soda in sweet tea when we were growning up and so that is how I make mine, you can really tell a difference in the flavor of the tea.

This method really does make the best sweet tea.  The only thing I needed to do differently is use a couple more tea bags, but that's just my personal preference.  I like my tea strong and sweet.  It came out perfect....clear, never got cloudy; and no bitter aftertaste.  I've also tried it with loose black tea leaves, and it was also very good.  I used 2 heaping tablespoons of tea leaves.  I'll never use the ice tea maker again.  This is so much better and just as easy!  Thanks!

Prepared as advertised and turned out great!  We combined this 50/50 with "The Best Lemonade Ever" for a wicked Arnold Palmer :)

This tea is delicious!  I never realized my tea was bitter until i followed the recipe and added a pinch of baking soda.  How wise! I served it at a baby shower and discovered too late that 5 gallons was not enough!  Everyone loved it and they were disappointed to not get more of it.  This is a keeper!

Not sure what happened here. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with little more than colored water with a bit of sugar.

I never had Sweet Tea before because restaurants never have it in decaf! That's the way I made this one! Other than that I followed the recipe exactly...well I also added a squeeze of fresh lemon...but other than those two things, I made it as written! This was very good! It tasted like a really good iced tea! I love the baking soda trick because it seems to make it taste 'Smooth', just like the title!

Great recipe. I add a teabag of raspberry zinger tea to the six regular teabags and a half cup of sugar does the trick for me.  Nice subtle raspberry flavor.

This is perfect!!!! I grew up in the south and this tastes just like my granny made it. The baking side is definitely the key! The tea is perfectly smooth and not bitter at all. I have a feeling this will be a regular in our house now.

I am not a tea drinker at all but I have children and grandkids who love their sweet tea. Although I just happened on this recipe I have been making mine exactly like this for several years. According to the kids it's better than anything in the stores.

Originally, I thought to myself, "this is a bit weak".  Then I re-read the ingredients and realized that I only used TWO teabags.  OOPS!

Once I went back and added the remaining teabags, it was perfect.

Add another 5 star rating for this simple yet delightful tea.  Thanks!

Thought it was a bit to sweet and not enough tea flavor.  I used 2 tea bags for 8 cups of water and did not think that was enough.

Having lived in the south my whole life, I had heard about baking soda in sweet tea before, but was always afraid to try it, but I add it every time to my tea now, so don't be afraid! It really cut out the 'bitterness' of the tea, and made it very smooth. We always use Luzianne Tea and at least a cup of sugar.

This is my go to iced tea recipe. I usually double this and keep a pitcher in my refrigerator. I try to have some on hand when having guests over, and I have always had great reviews on it. Thanks for posting this!

I can drink a gallon of this in one day. It's that good. Living in the southeast for a couple years really makes you crave the sweet tea when it's unavailable and this totally hits the spot! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

perfect!  in hawaii we don't get sweet tea (the one thing i miss from mcdonalds) so i am glad i was able to find a great sweet tea recipe.  And the best part is you can change it to suit your tastebuds.  i like my tea really really sweet so i added about a 1/3 cup more of sugar.  mmm!

This is wonderful and the tea is crystal clear with no baking soda taste at all. I have always poured the hot water over the sugar first to make a pseudo simple syrup and then added the tea bags to steep after the sugar is dissolved. Makes a "smoother" taste. I also added some fresh mint from the garden. OMG...heaven in a glass!

I too am IN LOVE with Mcdonalds' Sweet Tea, and this recipe is pretty much exactly the same, depending on what type of tea you use. I used chamomile because it was the most generic kind I had on hand, and it almost matched the Mcdonald's version. I am now going to make this tea regularly!

Until now my husband made the best home made iced tea I'd ever had.  This recipe tops his, mainly because the baking soda takes the bitterness from the tea.  This is the best homemade Iced tea I've had.  I use a cup of sugar and I let the teabags steep much longer because I like my tea sweet and strong.

Yum!! I love SWEET tea!! Thank you!!
I make this tea everyday, I like to let the tea bags soak in the water for a few hours you get a stronger tea flavor. I boil the water first thing in the morning and throw in the tea bags in the pot let them rest in there for a few hours then I just throw in some baking soda (it sounds weird but it works) and a cup of splenda then pour it into a container with cold water. This tea is better than the sweet tea they sell at many fast food chains.

I had an abudance of fresh mint so I made some mint syrup.  I then went searching for an iced tea recipe in hopes of adding some mint syrup to a glass of it and I came across this one.  I made this recipe exactly as written and tried it with and without the mint syrup and I must admit this recipe is simply delicious on its own.

This was so good. I love McDonalds sweet tea and being that I don't really eat much fast food anymore this was an excellent alternative. I doubled the recipe and made about a gallon of tea. Thank you for this recipe! EDIT: I've been adding 1 vanilla caramel truffle tea bag in addition to the regular tea and it's AMAZING! :)

DH thinks this tea is great!  Used 3 regular tea bags and 3 green tea honey lemon ginseng.  Also used splenda in place of sugar.  As I like my tea unsweetened, I have never been able to get the sugar ratio right - this must be it!  Thanks for sharing.

I know I don't need to say it again, but the baking soda makes such a difference.  I might never go back to the Mcdonald's sweet tea again.

Loved this!  I served it at a birthday party and everyone loved it.  It certainly does seem "smoother" and does not have the after taste that even sweet tea usually has.

I absolutely love this. Smooth and not too sweet. My family was waiting for the bitter aftertaste that often comes with our brewed tea but this was perfect. Thanks so much!

This is exceptional. I like a less sweet tea so I cut the sugar down for personal preference, but everyone asks for more when I make this. We now serve this at all our church functions. You can make this 20-30 minutes before serving and then just pour it over ice.

Refreshing and delicious!  My mother-in-law loves sweet tea, but has stopped ordering it in restaurants due to never knowing if it will be brewed the way she likes it.  She drank this a few weeks ago when visiting and said, "Can you make me a few batches of this so I can have it at home and take it with me when going out to eat?"  We all love the taste and I love how clear it looks in a glass pitcher.

This makes perfect iced tea.  The pinch of baking soda really is crucial to taking away the bitterness and making it crystal clear.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness, too.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!

I don't like tea, but my husband said this was really good.  I used Lipton's tea with a hint of peach, then added peaches while the tea was steeping.  I also took another reviewer's idea of making tea cubes because hubby complains about watery tea caused by ice cubes.  He loved them!  Thanks!

This makes the very best sweet tea you will ever drink! I confess, I do add an extra 1/4 cup of sugar since my husband likes it really sweet, and it is just perfect! My relatives from Tennessee even say it's the best sweet tea they've ever had, and they drink alot of sweet tea! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

first of all i am from Canada and for the most part our idea of iced tea is made from powder form. I'll be honest I love my good old powdered iced tea. still i have found myself intrigued by 'real iced tea' and time and time again i have been disappointed. I guess I'm just not a true tea lover. However, this tea is divine. It is amazingly smooth and so easy to drink. Very refreshing. I followed directions exactly, it was a bit sweet for me, so next time I might reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup. Other then that it simply can't be beat...can hardly wait to try on some of my die hard 'powder tea' friends. update...i have now begun to add the juice of one lemon and two limes...omg...i didn't think i could make it any better, i love it...in fact the other day i had iced tea in a restaurant...the powder kind...and it just didn't taste nearly as good.

I was so happy that I made your drink. It's much better than Mc Donalds & White Castle's version. I'll continue spreading the word. I wanted the whole picture to myself, but my niece's & nephew made it there favorite in the house too. I used no plain black tea. But used Lipton's decafe tea. Came out the same. Just like I like it  Sweet. Thanks, CC3. :}

This is perfect!  I am from northern Wisconsin and make mine with this recipe minus the sugar, but my family loves sweet tea, so I make theirs with sure.  They love it!  Our friends from Kansas said the sweet tea was great!   It is never bitter or cloudy.

I never would have believed how much of a difference a couple pinches of baking soda could make in a gallon of sweet tea. But, it does! There is no bitter after taste and the tea does not get strong after being refrigerated overnight. Thank you for the great tip!

I love this Sweet Tea Recipe! Because it uses less sugar than a traditional Sweet Tea (that we call Sugar Shock Tea), I feel I can make it more often. I use decaffeinated tea bags, and it has not affected the taste. In fact, my husband likes this recipe better than any other I've tried. It's very close to his SC Momma's Tea...minus the bitter after-taste. Definitely a keeper! Give it a try. You'll be keeping it too.

This tea was fantastic! The added baking soda really changed the taste to absolute perfection. All the measurements make a perfect pitcher of tea. I used decaffeinated tea and substituted Splenda for the sugar. Now I can drink a lot of it with no guilt. The really cool thing was no one noticed the change when I served it at my dinner party. I got rave reviews and everyone asked for more. Thank you for posting this recipe. You have changed my way of making tea from now on!

I can't handle the full dose of sugar in this recipe (I'm Canadian; when in the southern US, I ask for half-sweet tea). A heaping 1/3 cup is perfect for me.  Aside from that, this is a fabulous recipe. I was apprehensive about the baking soda, but it does prevent the overbrewed-tannin taste.   I've also made this with Splenda (8 packets = half sweet), just to cut down on the calories. Using sugar is by far more satisfying. Definitely a keeper!

This is exactly how my Texas grandmother made tea. Don't be tempted to skip the baking soda. It's essenial for removing the bitterness and cloudiness that tea sometimes has. Yummy!

Great recipe but I found it too sweet for me.  Luckily the amount of sugar is so easy to change.

I froze some raspberries into the ice cubes reduced the cold water a bit and added the ice cubes when serving...as the ice cubes melted it gave it a raspberry flavor, going to try with other fruits to see how that goes....definitely a hit with the teenager in the house that does not drink much soda.

I wish I had learned this trick years ago! Adding the baking soda does something to make the bitterness go away. The tea is indeed very smooth!

This was too sweet for us but can't criticize it for that because it is called (sweet tea) :). I liked very much how smooth it was, I will make it again with less sugar. :)

Thank you for this recipe!! Mcdonalds stopped selling the sweetea for $1 so I was looking for a way to make it at home. I tried other recipes and they tasted bitter. I thought it was the lipton tea bags that I was using, but it wasn't. I was missing the baking soda. Wow, what a difference a pinch makes, the sweet tea is so smooth and delicious!

This was wonderful, I could tell, there was no bite to the tea like it usually has. I never would have guess a a pinch of baking soda would knock that right out. Wow. I'm impressed. I used decaf tea and splenda due to my preference and health reasons. My kids couldn't tell the difference between caffeinated and pure sugar tea verses this...other then it wasn't overly sweet, to me it was just right. Thanks, I think this is going to be the preferred way I make tea.

Very good! I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was REALLY sweet. Made another batch using 1/4 cup of splenda which was equally as good, minus a few hundred calories ;)

Just as the name implies, smooth and sweet. I used 2 large tea bags for a 2 quart pitcher (I assume the 6 bags in this recipe refer to those little bags.) I also only needed 2/3 of a cup of sugar. It was plenty sweet for us. The addition of the baking soda really does take away that bitter taste. Great idea! Thanks for this recipe.

I should give this recipe 10 stars. I gave the recipe to my grandma, who was addicted to Mc D's tea, but now she can just make it at home! I too love making this and its definitely way less bitter! Thanks for a great iced tea!

Thanks for the tip!  This tea is awesome!!!!  I use the family style tea bags, so I used another users suggestion and double the water, use 1/4 tsp. of soda and four family style tea bags.  Let it steep and stir in 1 1/2 cups sugar and after sugar melts, 10 cups water.  Finally got my tea to where both my husband and I like it.

Awesome recipe!! I've never been able to make good iced tea, though I've lived in southern Virginia most of my life, so this is a great day! Smooth and perfectly sweetened tea ... made by me. :P  The baking soda, as so many others have agreed, did the trick on the bitterness. I doubled the recipe and used four family-sized tea bags. Since I didn't have a glass pitcher, I used my trusty Rubbermaid one, filling it to the spout with cold water after the sugar dissolved (about eleven cups).  I will definitely use this recipe on a regular basis. Thank you!

This would have been good, but I had to add some things to make it better. I put some lemon juice right before serving along with a splash of orange liquer and it turned out great.

Delicious! Not too sweet and no bitter aftertaste! I doubled the amount so I could use my gallon tea jar. I only used 7 tea bags though. I didn't reduce the amount of sugar.

I've reduced the sugar to just a little over 1/3 cup.  This tea, in all of its forms (black, green, fruity or not) got my family and friends through the hottest days of the summer.  Love it!

This is so good. I have had the recipe about 2 days now and have made double the recipe about 3 or 4 times now. Its that good and it is very smooth.  I may go through alot of tea bags but its worth it.  I will make this for my next family get together.

I love sweet tea, and since I live in Korea- it's VERY hard to come by. After getting tired of powdered Lipton tea mixes, I decided to give this a try. It's perfect, and very quick to make.

Pretty good. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar as the others suggested and thought it was great. No bitterness at all from the tea. I like mine a little stronger, I add about 2 cups of water less.

Super sweet, just like it is made in Georgia and Alabama.  I used RED ROSE tea bags because they are cheap and multipurpose...I'd recommend only using 4-5 and steeping for only about 10 minutes.  The black tea flavor is very strong otherwise (but still good).

This tea really does taste like or as good as the McD's sweet tea!!! I would never have thought to put a pinch of baking soda in to counteract the bitterness. I am so glad I found this recipe. Thanks!

Love the tea.. thank you, I did only use 1/2 cup sugar and may even try with even less next time, but the steeping steps and baking powder add alot.  My boy will love this tea.

I used two large size Luzianne tea bags and 1/2 cup of sugar-splenda blend.  My pitcher would not hold the entire 6 cups of cold water, so I added 5 cups and it worked perfectly. The tea did not get "cloudy" after being in the fridge. I will be making tea this way again!  Thanks for the recipe!

You would think that you would be able to taste the baking soda, but you can't.  It tastes very smooth without the wang.  Great tea!

I tried several recipes to make sweet ice tea! FINALLY - the real thing! I made a slight modification by replacing the sugar with splenda. Yum!  THE BEST ICE TEA EVER!

This summer we traveled to the South for the first time.  My daugher, who had never even heard of 'Sweet Tea', fell in love with it and really missed it when we came home.  I found this recipe and am so glad I can make it for her (even though I am not a fan!). I have even made it using Splenda and she loves it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am really enjoying this tea. Be sure to include that pinch of baking soda. It rounds the flavour and will cut any bitterness from the tea. It's also a good idea to never squeeze the tea bags as you are removing them as this too may cause your brew to be bitter. Thanks for this recipe.

We had guests visiting from FL and they were talking about 'sweet tea' so I had to make some.  SUPER!  I also sugared some lemon slices for a garnish if desired and they loved those with the tea.  Have made several pitchers of this and will continue to do so.  Thanks for the recipe.  I have now made Southern Sweet Tea!

I'm hooked. This is fantastic and has become a staple in our house. The addition of the baking soda allows you to steep the tea longer for a stronger, more concentrate taste without the bitterness and without having to use far more tea bags than necessary (I hate the ice-diluted taste!). Great stuff.  Really!

I liked this recipe very much, the first batch I used peach flavored tea and followed the suggestions and added the extra 1/4 of a cup (way to sweet, even for me and i have a sweet tooth, I made it with earl grey which is lovely but I like the peach tea, will follow the recipe exactly next time, but a real keeper...

Being a born and bread southerner, I have made sweet tea me entire life.  When I ran across this recipe, it was the first time I had ever seen it made with baking soda.  I tried it and loved it!  I'm not sure what the exact purpose of the soda is, but it seems to take the slight bitter edge off of the tea.

I doubled the batch and used a "Gallon sized" iced tea bag and it worked perfectly. The baking soda, as stated, really helped the bitterness. Crazy to see that this has been on here for so long and I'm just now making it!!!

Best sweet tea ever!  The baking soda really does take the bitterness out.  This is the cleanest, freshest, sweet tea I have ever had.  This is definitely the way I will make it from now on.

So easy and so good! This Sweet Tea is so smooth and has just the right amount of sweetness when 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon/lime juice is added to the recipe. I can't wait for the summertime to get here - I'll make a batch of this everyday for sure! But of course I'll be experimenting with flavours all winter too haha. Best sweet tea/iced tea recipe I've ever tried! It's now a staple at my house.

Great sweet tea! All my friends from the south LOVE it and ask me often to make it for them! My only advice would be to follow instructions and use a GLASS container for initial mixing. I used just my pot that I boiled the water in the second time and it tasted horrible! But every other time o have made it it has been great!

This is the official drink of southerners!  I double the recipe and add one container of frozen juice (5-Alive is my favorite, but orange mango, any citrus blend will do) in place of some of the cold water.  It's a real treat for my adult children.

Made in a 2-cup measuring cup in the microwave, covered with a towel, and steeped with some re-used sliced ginger that I had used to make Ginger Lemonade from this site.  Cooled and then  added to a jug with pre-chilled water and chilled some more.  Wonderful!  The ginger was so good in the lemonade I thought why not try in some tea, too.  Very good!  The baking soda did the trick in removing the bitterness that often would give me a stomach ache.

Very good level of tea strength and as the name says "smooth".  Although I hail from Southern origins, I am a traitor to my roots because I don't care for super-sweet tea, which is why I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup; more than sweet enough for my taste. In fact, next time I will make this without sugar and sweeten it with simple syrup in my drinking glass. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

For those that gave this a low rating not because of anything to do with the recipe, but because they never heard of Pyrex, I think that is unfair to the person that posted this recipe and to the community. I wish people would just rate the recipe for what it is and then give their advice as an added note.

No fuss, super easy and the tea drinkers in our house loved it. Suggest keeping a full jug in the fridge during the hot Summer months. No need to swing by Micky "D's" for your sweet tea fix any longer...

This was pretty disgusting. Granted, I'm not American, so maybe it's just a difference in culture, but I've had sweet tea in America and this in comparison is ike drinking sugar water. I was a little worried when the liquid looked a little syruppy and checked all the quantities, but I definitely made it right.

Gonna try it again with maybe a fourth of the recommended sugar.

Super easy recipe .... although I would prefer that an amount be specified instead of a "pinch" of baking soda (trust me too much is bad, not enough is worse). I have since found out that a "pinch" is an actual measurement that equals 1/8 teaspoon.

I lowered the sugar to 1/2 a cup as we all found it too sweet, we use Tetley tea bags so we lowered it to 5 bags and 17 minutes to steep.

Then once we add sugar, stir then I add 2.5 Tablespoons of lemon juice.

Absolutely love it - can be made with other flavoured teas as well. Blueberry white tea is AMAZING using this recipe.

We can't have a lot of sugar, so I substituted stevia and/or  honey for the white sugar. I've heard of the baking soda trick, and I'm glad to have this recipe because it shows how to use the baking soda and the tea to water ratio. The tea is nice and clear. My Grandmother made southern sweet tea, and this tastes and looks like hers. It's great for the summertime, or anytime. It won't last long around here. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is nearly perfect!

In my house, this recipe needs doubled, or even tripled.  I doubled this recipe exactly, and used 8 regular sized tea bags.

Because I was afraid of my tea jar cracking, I decided to do all steps within the pot I boiled the water in.  After the sugar had been stirred in, I poured the mix into my tea jar that already had the additional water needed inside.  

Turned out great!

I'm not a fan of sweet tea but it's all my wife will drink so I decided to make this for her one day.  It is now my go-to tea recipe, sweet or unsweet.  It couldn't be any easier and the tea is fantastic.  Who knew a little baking soda could have such a profound impact?  A few days ago, I needed to make enough tea for a crowd so I made a gallon of concentrate (complete step 1 only).  When I got to the event, it was super easy to add the concentrate to the tea dispenser and top it off to the 4 gallon mark.  This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing!

The first time I made this tea I had only half of the ingredients, so I divided all the ingredients by two and voila, this recipe was still totally delicious. I loved it so much I will make it a staple in my house.

I am a Southerner and have been making sweet tea all my life, and have never heard of adding a pinch of baking soda!  What a difference it makes!  Thank you.  In the summer I add fresh mint leaves from my garden to the steeping tea bags.  I add lemon when I add the cold water.  It is divine.  It does make a difference in how long you brew the tea bags, and it's best to not squeeze the bags before discarding.  I always want to do that.   And covering the tea while it steeps also helps make a better tea.  I like Luzianne tea the best.

Great recipe, I cut the sugar about 2 tablespoons, but it's such an insignificant amount I still give the recipe 5 stars. I love sweet tea and this definitely satisfies my craving, and this is coming from someone raised in Louisiana!

It was a little too sweet for me. So, I cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. It's perfect...delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe. I love sweet tea and I was taught one way, but it didn't taste as good as other sweet teas i have had. The baking soda is the difference. I was worried it would taste weird but it was amazing

I was worried that this was too many tea bags and that they steeped for too long. Plus we only had a plastic pitcher and not a glass one. I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect.

I've never had great luck making sweet or iced tea. I can bake my own bread make pastry yet, time and again my sweet teas always turned out bitter, and ended up down the drain. I'm happy to agree with all the reviews here the baking soda makes a huge difference! I will be making this sweet tea from now on

My husband is SUPER picky about his Sweet Tea, and I have tried other recipes. My family was not impressed until I tried this version. This recipe is a keeper! I followed the advice of another and added only 4 cups of cold water to make it Extra Sweet... I have made TWO double-batches already today! Thank you so much for sharing!! I will now save $$ AND help the environment by not having to purchase several bottles of Pure Leaf (formerly Lipton) Extra Sweet Tea every day!! Yay!!!! ??

Excellent! Having grown up in Florida and moved to Michigan there isn't much sweet tea here. This is by far the best I've had since I was a kid. I'm sure the baking soda did the trick because it's not a least bit bitter. My new favorite!

Be careful, too heavy a pinch of baking soda tastes salty.  I wou1ld make this again and again but I have another procedure that works for me:
Fill my 2 qt pitcher almost full with water from the hot tap (our hot water is softened) plus 1 or 2 large tea bags (Tetley or Luzianne).  Heat this on high in the microwave for 10 minutes and let sit until cool enough to handle.  Remove tea bags, add a big scoop of turbinado sugar (probably 3/4 cup).  Chill and serve over ice.  I add other flavor teas occasionally (orange spice, chai, mint, ...).  We had some issues with our kitchen sink that required turning off the cold water for a few days.  This is when I discovered that softened water makes a smother tea with no clouding or bitterness.

I do like this recipe and it is a great substitute for the $3/gal Milo's tea my kids are "addicted" to. I seriously think they must be putting something in it to make them want it! lol  Since they are "addicted" and even though this tea is really good, my son STILL won't accept this substitute! I may have to begin mixing half and half as a cost savings! Thanks for the recipe!

6 tea bags per 8c of water? As skeptical as I was I hate it when people don't follow the recipe as written and then give a bad review so I followed it to the letter. What I ended up with was a pitcher of the darkest strongest iced tea in existence and it was so over sweet. Afterwards I tried to dump 1/4 of it out, add more water and some lemon but its still too strong and wayyyyy too sweet. Other recipes call for FAR less tea bags so I think I'll go try one of those. I would not make this one again.

Oh My!  I didn't have any regular black tea on hand, so I made it with Red Rose Sunset Spice tea (black tea, orange flavor, cinnamon and cardamom) and used the specified amount of sugar.  A little too sweet for me, but I'm a northern New England gal who's used to unsweetened tea with lemon..  Anyway, I digress.  I drank it all in about 2 days.  :)

My 2nd attempt had me using the same spiced tea and reducing the sugar by 1/2.  I didn't add the cold water, and put this concentrate in a Mason jar in the refrigerator.  On the advice of a review on here, I mix the tea concentrate with milk in a glass in roughly a 1:3 ratio (like the ratio for tea to cold water in the recipe).  It's an amazing iced spiced tea latte.  I'm really bummed winter is coming - these iced lattes are SO good!  Of course, I can heat the whole thing up for a delicious hot latte...  No more Tim Horton's for me! 

Can't wait to experiment with another flavor of tea.  

Thanks for a great recipe and to the review(s) that gave me the latte idea!

This is my favorite sweet tea! I use 2 Luzianne ice tea bags. I actually pour my sugar right into the pan and heat it up with the water, just like when I make simple syrup. I pour enough ice and cold water into a pitcher to make 6 cups total and stir my baking soda into that. Then when the tea is done seeping, I pour it right into the cold water and stir.

I make this recipe probably 3-10 times per week, dependent upon the number of guests we have in the home. I never change a thing except to make double or triple the amounts, as needed. Absolutely the best find on this website!!!!

Great recipe!   Bit too sweet for me so I reduced the amount of sugar until I figured out what works for my tastes.  (I prefer 1/3 cup of sugar).   The Baking soda really works... before then I always had this slimy film on top and it eradicated that problem!

I love iced tea but can never drink it because it gives me heartburn and I don't like the bitterness.  The baking soda trick is exactly what I needed.  This is a little sweet for my taste, so I'll try cutting the sugar next time, and maybe adding a little mint.  Wonderful simplicity.

I wanted to see how close this tea was to the tea that I was raised on in Alabama.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The proportions of ingredients are perfect.  It's definitely sweet, without being painfully sweet.  It's the perfect drink to sip on while you are sitting on the front porch!  My 5 year old son tried it, and LOVED it!  You made this Alabama girl proud!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I am under 12 and I made this tea. I am a HUGE sweet tea drinker. It was fairly easy and I only used three tea bags and it was almost too strong. I substituted sugar for Stevia. Also, I added lemonade mix to part of it, and both are delicious. The baking soda thing is clever. Thanks!

i have used the proportions in this recipe including the baking soda for every kind of cold tea for summer months. sometimes i use Constant Comment, sometimes i use green tea, somtimes a fruity Celestial Seasonings.  i ontinue to use the bakiing soda because it does chse off the bitterness regardless of the leaves being used.  and it adds that bit of saltiness that every sweet thing needs to make it work.  i really wanted a good raspberry tea rx, used this and a few drops of raspberry extract. half a gallon gone in a few hours, and it was just me!!!

Simple recipe for delicious iced tea.  Everyone has their own preference when it comes to the sweetness, so just adjust the sugar to your tastes.  I prefer 1/2 cup.

I never was much of a tea drinker and didn't know how to make good tea.  I was having to make tea for the family gathering for Christmas Eve and found this recipe.  I followed the ingredients list exactly, but I changed the method a bit.  I wasn't sure my glass pitcher could stand boiling water poured into it, so I boiled the water in a pan, turned it off, put in the pinch of baking soda and steeped the tea bags directly in the pan with the 2 cups of water.  While it was steeping, I poured the cool 6 cups of water in the pitcher.  When steeping time was up, I removed the tea bags and dissolved the sugar in the pan before pouring into the pitcher with the cool water.

My grandson likes the full amount of sugar.  I can do with a couple of tablespoons less.  It's great tea and very smooth, not bitter. Thank you!  Now I'm a tea drinker!

Thank you for posting this recipe.  Wow!  I have been trying to make sweet tea for years without any success.  I never knew about the baking soda trick.  IT WORKS!!!!  I used 1/4 teaspoon.  I also used Luzianne tea bags and white sugar.  It makes it pretty sweet so if you don't like your tea really sweet, try using 1/4 cup less sugar.

As for the review that said putting the boiling water into a heat proof glass pitcher was a recipe for disaster - I have done this for years. I just put a big metal ladle in the pitcher to help absorb the heat asnd pur the water into the ladle and let it run over the edge to cool down even further. I prefer to use glass over the plastics because of the chemical content in plastics.

Me and my husband are big on sweet tea, and this is by far the best and easy too! The baking soda really does the trick. I couldn't help but take a little test taste before putting it in the fridge, sooooo good! Definitely a keeper.

My husband (southerner) and I (midwesterner) both loved this tea.  I like that the taste of the tea itself is still discernible beneath the sweetness.

As a southerner I did know about the baking soda in tea, I also add baking soda to beans. I had forgotten about adding it to tea so thanks for the reminder. As for bitter tea, brands vary in their bitterness so I have never been a fan of Lipton. I prefer Luzianne or even Walmarts to Lipton. I don't own a tea maker or even a glass pitcher. I do have a 4 cup glass measuring cup and I add 2 cups water and bring to a boil in the microwave. Remove from microwave, stir in sugar, add tea bags, cover and let it steep 10-15 minutes.

My middle daughter always looks forward to when we travel in the South because sweet tea is served in every restaurant, not something we experience in the North except at a few fast food places. While I grew up on homemade iced tea, iced tea around our house typically was Crystal Light Peach Tea. I discovered this recipe a couple of weeks ago and, let me tell you, homemade iced tea has become the beverage of choice in our house now! Can I just say, though, if I made only a single recipe at a time, I would be makinng it at least 2 times a day. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I'm a Northern PA lady who adores Southern Sweet Tea.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to get sweet tea except at McDonald's (yes, McDonald's).  In Pennsylvania, tea is a cup of hot water and a tea bag.  Iced tea is the same thing with a few ice cubes thrown in for good measure.  The South has it all over the North with its sweet tea (and grits).  Thank you for posting this recipe and saving me trips galore to Mickey D's!

I enjoyed this and so will my bank account!  I will cut back on the sugar just a bit or maybe steep my tea longer as it was a little too sweet for me.  I was buying sweet tea already made and I was feeling guilty since I figured it was something I could make at home.

I grew up with my southern mom's good ol' sweet tea (but she uses half Lipton tea bags and half Constant Comment made by Bigelow - it just adds a nice sweetness/flavor to it and helps not be as bitter). Now I am making my own pitchers of tea and I had never heard of adding the baking soda which is wonderful.  Thank you for sharing that tip!

Excellent!! I made it with Rooibos South African tea, which I love hot. Since it is getting so hot out now I figured I'd try it cold. This recipe worked perfectly as is. No changes at all. Thanks for sharing!

I started making this tea back in June 2011, removing the tea bags really does keep the tea from turning cloudy. My family and friends all drink tea at my house, can hardly keep up with the demand.Thx.

I live in an area of the country where asking for sweet tea at a restaurant gets me strange looks.  So, its great to have a good sweet tea recipe to satisfy my cravings.  This one is the best I've had!  Even better than most sweet tea I had when i lived in the south.  So simple to make too.  Amazing!

Great tea! Mine did not seem strong enough but I think that was my fault, maybe I didn't let it steep long enough. Also, I accidentally added an extra cup of water.

Love it!  I triple the recipe and itis still perfect.  The baking soda is the the key to the smoothness. I use Luzianne ice tea brewing bags. The bags are double the size of a normal bag so I use 5 for a triple brew.  I am trying to use a sugar substitute. Haven't found the key for that yet.

This recipe is great, if enough people havent' said so yet!

The only thing I'm unsure about is the type of tea I used.  This has nothing to do with the recipe, but I'm wondering if there is a specific kind of tea that is best for sweet tea.  Ideas, anybody?

I'm not a tea drinker, so I can't really comment about how good this is compared to other iced teas. But, every time I make this, everyone comments about how good it is.  I am guessing it is the baking soda that makes the difference.

Really Good!!!  no more bitterness!! I wish it was a little stronger. Next time I may reduce water just a hair, or use a couple extra tea bags.

I did make a simple syrup, 1 to 1 ratio.  I think this could be skipped but, I was going for the gold medal of tea. It was a photo finish... Under review.

Thanks!

I particularly like to use vanilla or coco chai tea. Then I just add a bit of milk for a perfect iced chai tea.

I would have never guessed in a million years that baking soda was the key to getting rid of that indescribable after-taste I usually find in home-brewed tea.  I love making this drink.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

WAY too sweet for our liking.  We like our sweet tea, but this was REALLY sweet and a bit on the weak side.  I would have let the tea steep longer or added more teabags, for sure.  And I'd definitely cut the sugar at least in half.

Oh my gosh!! This was absolutely as wonderful as the rest of the reviews depicted. I didn't have a glass pitcher, so I simply steeped the tea bags in the pan in which I boiled the water and the baking soda for 15 minutes. I added the sugar to the pan after removing the tea bags, and brought the water JUST to a boil again to help dissolve the sugar. Next time I will try this using Splenda because 3 of the people in our house are diabetic. My boyfriend loves the sweet tea from McDonald's and Speedway and he said it's similar to theirs.

This made some great tasting tea.  The sugar was the perfect amount to make for gatherings when you dont know how sweet people like it.  For me I would add about a cup of sugar in this recipe to fit my tastes, we like it sweet!  Im giving it 4 stars only because I make tea a lot and this didnt taste any different than how I normally make it.  I always use Luzianne brand and steep it for only 5 min. so that you dont get that bitterness flavor.  Im sure steeping this for 15 min without adding the baking soda, would of made it taste bitter.  So I am convinced that it works!  Still this is a good "go to" recipe for when Im using a different brand of tea that has more of that bitter flavor.  So Im sure I will use again!  Thanks for the recipe idea!

I was a little skeptical of the baking soda, but it totally does take away the bitterness. I didn't steep it but five minutes, because that's all I used to do without the baking soda, but I definitely could have steeped it longer for a fuller tea flavor without the bitterness!

Too sweet. I like an iced tea to taste like it has some tea in it, not just sugar water. 1/2 the sugar or increase the water and use more tea.

I wasn't too sure of the baking soda, so I didn't use it and it's still ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! It does remind me of McDonalds sweet tea, which I have come to love. This will save me $5 plus per week by making it myself. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

love that sweet tea! I use two family size teabags, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1 cup sugar. I make it in a mr. coffee tea maker. i put the sugar and baking soda into the container that the tea is made in, it helps to melt the sugar down. then i stir the sugar till melted and then i pour into a gallon pitcher and fill with water.

thx, cookincode3, for a fool-proof sweet tea recipe. it is now my old man's water, so much cheaper too than the store-bought kind. i follow it exactly each time but i double the recipe which he can finish in about 2-3 days. last time i made it though, for some reason, i ended up with 64 oz of tea using 14 bags of tea and 1.5 cups sugar. clearly, i intended to double the recipe again but forgot to double the liquid. the tea still turned out the same, no sweeter than usual. weird but glad it still turned out great! (i didn't add water because there was less than a third left when i realized what i'd done :)

This is great, but I did add a small amount of lemon into the glass of ice before adding the tea.  I have now tried it with all sorts of different teas, they all turned out great.  Thanks for a great summer of TEA

I spent a few weeks of vacation eating at The Cracker Barrel and fell in love with Sweet Tea which I had never had before.  I hit home and came here to find this perfect recipe!  My first batch was dead one perfect and the second the same and with Fresh squeezed lemon I am hooked for life!

We're from Mobile,Al.(born,raised and still residing!)....in the South, sweet tea is like water-it's a staple....I've never used baking soda in mine and I've never even heard of it.....but, I can try it! Another way if you're pinched for time to do the actual steeping is run it through your coffee pot....just put your bags where the filter would go and start your pot, then add everything else to it! I saw some other members talking about mint leaves-we add lemon to ours; a sliced wedge or a splash of lemon juice..when I say "ours",I don't mean my family,I mean SOUTHERNERS! Enjoy!

This recipe is perfect! As other reviewers have mentioned the pinch of baking soda really takes the bitterness out of the black tea and I find that the 3/4 cup of sugar is just the right sweetness for me. I'm a huge tea drinker so I've also adapted the recipe for a number of other iced teas. I have a nice Ginger Peach Black Tea that I've been making for years with fresh ginger, peach slices, and fresh mint and this recipe makes it even better! Also, I've found that it works nicely with herbal teas like mint and lemon balm, although for lighter teas I think it's better to cut the sugar down to half a cup to not overwhelm the delicate flavors.

I have been trying different recipes for sweet tea and this one is THE ONE!!! This taste better then the McD's sweet tea I think. The baking soda does seem to be the trick to this tasting SO yummy.

Having grown up in NC, I have always been a fan of sweet tea.  And this is no exception!   It's very similar to the tea I've always made, but I like that I dissolve the sugar in the strong tea before adding water.   Definitely a keeper.

I use this recipe but a bit backwards. boil 3 cups of water, remove heat. add baking soda and 3 fam. sized tea bags let steep for 13 minutes. add to gallon pitcher to make 1 gallon of iced tea. same results... Tea the whole neighborhood loves!  Promise your neighbors your southern brewed sweet tea and they will do just about anything!

Wonderful sweet tea.  The only problem is that, when made as written, it only makes 8 cups... which lasts about 8 minutes in our house! :)  BF says "this can be in the fridge all the time".  I agree.  I can see this tea taking getting a permanent spot alongside the milk and oj.  If you plan to make this often, as I do, buy the big tea bags.  Only takes 2.

Honestly, I didn't think a pinch of baking soda was going to make such a big difference. I'm a HUGE Ice Tea fan, always have it in the house and I've never had a better tasting one than this! Totally gonna keep adding the baking soda from here on out! No more bitterness!

WOWZA!!  What a score!  McDonald's sweet tea at home - no drive thru!  I made this just like the recipe, then did a taste test with the Mickey D's that was in the fridge, and couldn't tell the difference at all!  Next stop, trying one recipe with decaf tea and one with at least partial sweetener (to cut the calories down from 9/oz.) just to see the differences.

Yup, this is the one!  I live in North Carolina, and you can get this stuff anywhere, but you'll pay for it. Here you can make it at home for a fraction of the cost, and it tastes just as good ( actually its even better than some of the restraunts sweat tea around here! )

for whatever reason, i've never been able to make iced tea that was drinkable, until now. not sure if it's because i was using one family sized tea bag for every 2 called for in previous recipes (thanks, heather, for straightening me out), or because i wasn't yet privy to the baking soda trick. but i'm cured now. this turned out perfect and was enjoyed by some pretty serious sweet tea enthusiasts.

This is very smooth but it is a little too sweet and a little weak for my taste.  I'm going to steep another cup or two of tea and see if that helps.

I LOVE this recipe.  Over the summer, I fell in love with Chick-fil-A sweet tea.  This has become my new favorite.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, but the sweetness is a matter of personal taste anyway.  The baking soda takes out the "bite" and this is, as the recipe says smoooth.  Smooth & yummy.  Thanks!

This was DELICIOUS!!! I ran across this recipe and whipped it up in about 20 minutes. I served it with my Sunday dinner and my family loves it. Bye-bye diet cola, this will be a staple at my house from now on.

Maybe I'm just not used to sweet tea, but I thought this was only okay. It was very, very sweet for my taste and a little too strong. I only steeped the tea bags for 10 minutes, but maybe the kind I used - Ceylon Assam - was simply too strong. I felt it needed some lemon or lime to give it additional flavour. Maybe I'm just an iced tea, not a sweet tea kind of girl. I liked the idea of the baking soda though.  I would definitely recommend filling the glass pitcher with hot tap water and letting it warm up for a few minutes before filling it with the boiling water and tea bags, or the glass is very likely to crack!

Love the method of making this tea (the pinch of baking powder).  Great idea.  Way too much sugar for us though.  Will make this a lot but I'll keep it unsweetened and let people sweeten themselves.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent tea.  I had no idea that baking soda could be used but it made the tea very clear.  I used Splenda so it was sugar free also.  Thanks for this method, I will use it from now on.

Great recipe. I tried adding 1/2 cup lemon juice and the result was superb. Now, I make it on daily basis as my refreshing drink while on diet. My tip: skip the sugar and add 1 cup of unsweetened pineapple juice to 3 cups of this recipe without the sugar. The result is one liter of refreshing drink to enjoy while dieting with only 133 calories (of pineapple). You can also use orange juice or whatever unsweetened juice you like. But I use pineapple for the fat burning property of it.

Excellent!  I boil 7c water, add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, use 8 family size tea bags, steep for 15 min, stir in 3c sugar, pour in 12 (16.9 oz) bottle water which I put in the fridge before.  Since the cold water makes the tea cool fast, I can right away pour it back into 17 bottles to about 1.5 inches below the cap (I also have 5 empty bottles).  Freeze them on Thursday night, take them out and head to the beach Sat morning.  The frozen tea bottles keep other food cool, and make a great drink.  If you only double the recipe, freeze them 1 night will be ok.  This is a wonderful recipe.  No need to adjust anything, the amount of sugar is perfect.  My husband really like it.  Thank you very much.  A+.

Most fun I have ever had with a recipe.  As Ya'll can see I am a Yankee and as such have never made sweet tea before.  I have a new found friend from the South and he was talking about sweet tea.  So I thought I would whip up a batch!  This recipe had 5 stars so why not try it.  I have now made it with Luzianne Tea bags and 2 cups of splenda for baking and Lipton tea bags and 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda for baking, both were WAY too sweet for this Yankee, but my Southern Friend prefers the Luzianne Tea and the splenda for baking try (the sweeter of the two) the best........so far. The rest of my friends from below the Mason Dixon are just laughing at me for having to look up a recipe!!! Thanks for all the cooks out there who make this web site one of the BEST!!! Now am I ready to move on to chicken fried steak???? :-) keep cooking Ya'all

The baking soda really does make a difference! I might decrease the sugar next time, but that's just a personal preference. It's delicious and refreshing nonetheless.

This is really good sweet tea. I only had family size tea bags so I used 2 and that was perfect. I used a little less sugar by personal preference. My only wonder is what exactly the baking soda does for it.I guess I need to try it without the baking soda to see if I can taste a difference! It was great though!

Yum! This recipe yields a very tasty sweet tea! I made a few modifications for personal taste: 1. I cut down the sugar a bit because I prefer a less sweet tea (plus, other people can add their own if it isn't sweet enough) and 2. I used a Raspberry flavored tea (Raspberry Zinger). It was delicious. Better than in the restaurants.  Also, I was too afraid to pour boiling water into my glass pitcher, so I switched things around a bit. I boil the water, sprinkle a pinch of baking soda in the water when I add the tea bags. While this is steeping for fifteen minutes, I stuck my glass pitcher filled with 6 cups of water in the fridge to cool. When the fifteen minutes is up, I stir in the sugar (I will try this next time with Splenda) and when it is dissolved, I poured it into the glass pitcher.

Wonderful tea recipe. I did as another reviewer suggested and used 4 family-sized tea bags and doubled all of the other ingredients. I think that the baking soda was what made it so wonderful. I just couldn't believe that I made some tea that was delicious and not bitter. I even used the Splenda for baking in mine, because I try to watch my sugar intake, but it was still really good. Thank you so much for a wonderful tea recipe. I am so happy to finally be able to make my own tea!

I am a northerner, but recall the delicious sweet tay I had in the south and have been craving it when the weather up north gets warm.  I decided to check allrecipes.com (my favorite site) and found this recipe.  I followed it exactly except for the amount of sugar which I cut back to 3/4 cup per other reviews.  Personally, I still found it a bit sweet for my taste, so next time I will start with a half cup and taste from there.  This tea was delicious--and will be my drink this summer!!!

I can't pass by a McDonald's without stopping for a large Sweet Tea. Now, I can make it at home that is just as good. I found with my first batch that my "pinch of baking soda" might have been a tad bit too much. My second batch was just right. Even my son who likes Sweet Tea finished up my pitcher when he was in town. Thanks for my MickyD Sweet Tea fix!

I"m not a big sweet tea fan, but this recipe was great!   I did sub the 6 tea bags for 2 family sized bags (Luzianne) and then added a third about half way through te steeping process.  turned out really well.  Thanks!

Absolutely perfect!!! I've been searching for a "real" sweet tea since my last trip to Tennessee. That bottled stuff doesn't even come close. This is perfect. I will be making this stuff a few times a week for sure!

I never would've thought of adding baking soda to iced tea, but it was pretty good! I'm known for my good southern style sweet tea, but I must say this is a step above mine. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This is perfect sweet tea!  Didn't change a thing.  I had been trying for so long to make perfect iced tea (and consistently) and this recipe nails it. It is not the least bit bitter either for such a long steep.  Thanks for posting it.

I love this tea!  Not bitter at all.  It's really sweet - so cut down the sugar if you like it more middle of the road.  I love it this way but a few people I've served it too have complained.  I also made it with splenda and it came out great.

Great sweet tea! I've never heard of the baking soda idea, there was no bitterness though! Next time I'll let it steep longer, it could have been stronger, and I may reduce the sugar a little. Thanks!

This is great tea. I had to make mine with chamomile because thats all I had and I was dying to make this so I thought I'd give it a shot. Turned out very nice. Pretty sweet, so I think next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I can't wait to try this with all different kinds of tea!  UPDATE: Ive made this several times now with black tea and its perfect! Also, I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and that works for us. Love this tea! :)

Had to try this since I am a "yankee" who recently moved to Alabama. It was easy; Six tea bags is the same as 3 family size tea bags. I only added about 5 cups of water and it tasted like restaurant quality to me. I HIGHLY recommend stirring the sugar into the boiling water so it always dissolves and won't need alot of stirring.

The baking soda worked miracles.  It was absolutely perfect when I used a simple syrup boiled with a sprig of mint and a couple of lemon wedges in place of the sugar.

Oh my God!  This recipe is perfect!  This saves me so much money!  I was buying a gallon of sweet tea from a local restaurant twice a week but it would sometimes be too sweet or too old tasting.  Now I can make my own perfectly.  I used decaff tea bags.  Thank you for the recipe!

Great basis recipe for a strong extra sweet tea. I made it with 4 bags instead of six, but I will definitely reduce the sugar next time.

Made a couple modifications because indont like super sweet tea. Put in about 1/3 cup sugar in my 2qt Takeya pitcher and filled half with boiling water. Added 4 Lipton  tea bags and steeped for 5 mins. Filled the rest of pitcher up with ice and shook for 30 seconds.

It turned out really good! I do recommend not adding as much sugar as the recipe says, because mine turned out a little bit too sweet for my tastebuds. If you enjoy sweet tea, then this is the perfect recipe for you!

Very good tea.  I used 1 cup of sugar, rather than 3/4 cup.  First time I made according to recipe.

This is a winner. I used approx. 1/3 cup sugar, but may increase a little next time. I am one who orders my tea half & half. Thank you for the instructions on how to make great tea!

My son and I absolutely LOVE ice tea/sweet tea and wanted to make our own. We tried this recipe before and it was good, but like anything on allrecipes, you tweak the ingredients to your liking. We used Tetley tea for our base which is a bit bitter so we used 1 1/4 of sugar instead of 3/4 and squeezed 1/2 lemon in and stirred. Absolutely DELICIOUS! Very very comparable to Brisk ice tea which is my son's favorite. Will definitely be using this recipe as our go to ice tea/sweet tea craving quencher for now on!

this is hands down the best sweet tea I have made. other sweet teas tend to leave a sharp acidic taste in the back of my throat, but this delivers as being smooth.
plus not to much sugar when you think about it, so it's not sickly sweet.

I have been making a version of this for years.  I love this recipe for the exact measurements and timing.  Sometimes in the past I let my tea bags seep too long.  And the pinch of baking soda is the deal breaker.  I will no longer be making any other version of my "sweet tea".

My first attempt at sweet tea...very happy with the results. Made no changes to the original recipe. Per my southern son-in-law's advice, I used Red Diamond tea.

Thanks for the baking soda tip! For a half sweet, no white sugar drink, I substituted 1/4 cup of honey. It was perfect!

I've made this NUMEROUS times and have forgotten to leave a review each time. I have made this for a single night, small parties, and even large family parties where I've had to use 84+ tea bags. I usually reduce the sugar a little based on other reviewers and it always turns out amazing. Thank you for this super simple, super delicious recipe.

This was perfect! I adjusted the recipe for a gallon and it's going FAST! I didn't completely double the sugar though because that seemed excessive. So instead of 1.5 cups I did a little less than 1. It's always personal preference of course as far as how sweet you like it. But this is the best recipe I've found so far!

First time making sweet tea and it didn't disappoint, I did squeeze half a lemon in and it really balanced everything out. Safe to say I'll be making it again.

This was the best recipe, I am a huge Chic-fa-las sweet tea and this tastes just like it! It made it in a plastic pitcher just to be safe and added at bit more sugar (which made it sweater). I totally reccomend this

I thought I didn’t like sweet tea because I grew up with iced tea with lemon (still a fave). My only experience with sweet tea came by way of McDonalds and Popeyes Fried Chicken. Both were way too sweet. 
This recipe, however, is a revelation! I shared the recipe with my best friend and now she is always a sweet tea drinker. 
I made it with Splenda. Still smooth. Still delicious. This is a keeper!

Made this exactly as specified, except I doubled it to make a gallon of tea.  Turned out great and earned high accolades from a friend who is discerning about his sweet tea.  I will definitely be making this again.

The  title aptly describes this tea. It is very smooth tasting! I used a large Pyrex bowl that I put a spoon in for the boiling water.  The whole thing filled my 2-qt plastic pitcher about 3/4 the way. The tea bags were orange pekoe, and they worked great, and the tea had just the right amount of sweetness. This will be nice on a hot summer day, or anytime! Easy recipe with no additives that you cannot pronounce! UPDATE 8/12/18: Used peach tea bags with same method, and it was really good. Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, and it had a nice, subtle sweetness. Good way to cut back on the soft drinks. (Recently did iced peppermint tea; like this much better.)

This iced tea tastes better than McDonald's sweet tea! I always chose coke and probably always will when I order from McDonald's, who makes better soda than them? But at home, I have become an iced tea drinker because of this recipe. I am sensitive to caffeine, so I have to limit myself and watch the time of day when I'm drinking it. This is a recipe that you will want to save!

I used 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar and made 12 cups with 8 tea bags, steeped in 8 cups of boiling water, before adding the other 4 cups of cool water. I don’t like it too sweet and this was perfect for my taste. The baking side tip is really a game changer. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Personally, I steeped the tea for roughly five minutes as I was afraid of it turning bitter. I also added some fresh lemon juice. Turned out great. Not too sweet, but just sweet enough. Definitely will make again

We love this sweet iced tea!  It's so smooth, has the perfect amount of sweetness and so refreshing.  I think we are ruined for all other sweet iced teas now!  Going to try this using Green Tea with Honey instead of sugar, then garnished with lemon slices.

The absolute BEST recipe for sweet tea ever! Baking soda is the secret, it's magic. Try it, you won't regret it. Perfect as is but I do cut the sugar a bit to suit my taste. Yum!

Finally after making several different recipes I came upon this.  After trying  several different teas and experimenting I came up with the BEST tasting sweet tea ever.  I used three of the Red Diamond (large) tea bags along with a regular size Earl Grey Bigelow black tea bag and put them in my Pyrex 8-cup shatterproof measuring cup with two cups bowling water and a pinch of baking soda.  I let it steep for ten minutes, removed the tea bags put a cup of sugar in it...stirring really well, poured it into my ice tea pitcher followed by six cups of filtered water.  The taste was perfect and so I chilled it in the fridge.  Best tasting ice tea so far.  Now,,, I just need to add a mint leaf,  lemon wedges, ice and I am set for the warm summer months of Texas!!!  Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful recipe.   Awesome!!!

Awesome! My go to recipe every Spring/summer! Someone mentioned glass cracking when pouring hot water in:  pour the hot water onto a table spoon that you hold in whatever glass container such that the hot water hits the sides of the container slowly and you shouldn't have a problem.

This is the best sweet tea recipe around! The tea is not overly sweet---just the right amount of sweetness, if you know what I mean. And it makes a lot (for one person, anyhow) so it'll last you a while! I pour the boiling water over the baking soda and tea bags into a 4-cup Pyrex measuring cup to sit for the 15 or so minutes, and, after removing the tea bags, I mix in the sugar until it fully dissolves. I then pour the hot tea and sugar mixture into an old glass apple cider jug using a funnel, and follow that with the 6 cups of water. That way just worked best for me!

A great refreshing tea.  I only use 1/2 cup sugar, as I like it a little less sweet.  I also add Lemon to it, which seems to give is a very refreshing taste.  Of course, the baking soda cuts the bitterness of the tea as well.  I also Luzianne Tea Bags, which seem to have less bitterness than other brands.

This is a pretty easy recipe for iced tea and also is easy to tweak.  I make two gallons at a time and use 4 family size tea bags.  I let them steep in the boiling water for 15 minutes before I remove them and add the tea to the pitcher where I stir in about 1.5 cups of sugar.  Once that is stirred in good, I finish filling the pitcher with water and refrigerate.  I don't even add the baking soda, and have no issues with the taste.

Some guys said pouring boiling water into a glass pitcher(even a "heat-proof" one) is a recipe for disaster. Obviously this guy has never heard of tempered glass.   Besides that, the recipe is spot on. Georgia born & bred southern boy here.  Was unaware of the baking soda trick.  Add your favorite fruit for an extra flavor.

Great recipe. I used Twinings single cup tea bags and steeped for the full 15 minutes. This will be the only iced tea recipe I will ever need. Next time, however, I will add a little less sugar. Thanks for sharing this.
Update: I have started using two-cup teabags to make the tea less weak. After steeping and adding the sugar I let it cool. I then divide the mixture into two tall containers and top each up with the required amount of cold water.

My wife and I absolutely love this tea. I boiled 4 cups of water instead of two. The tea turns out quite a bit darker and more favorable to our liking.  Thank you for the recipe.

This New Yorker just made the perfect pitcher of Southern Tea thanks to this recipe. I did measure out 1/4 a tsp of baking soda as opposed to the pinch listed to permit for consistency if the recipe proved worthy of keeping. Yes, it is a keeper! Thank you.

This sweet tea is phenomenal!My whole family loved it! Usually my father isn't big on sweet tea because it could sometimes be bitter or too sweet or just downright awful but even he loved it!I'd give this recipe more stars if I could.   I'll sure be using this recipe more frequently!

Even though I don't drink sweet tea, this method and the addition of the baking soda works for a smooth iced tea. It's true. Mine was a bit cloudy, but still smooth. Thank you for the recipe.

I don't have a large enough glass container so I boiled 4 cups water on the stove, added baking soda, mint sprigs and tea bags (2 peach, 5green tea) and steeped. Then I removed the mint and tea bags, added the sugar and 8 cups water, and placed in the refrigerator. Yumm!

I have tried many iced tea recipes, and all were WAY to sweet, I made this for a party and tripled the recipe...REALLY good, just like another reviewer said it tastes just like McDonald's tea except better! Everyone liked it a lot. We are making it again for another party, but I made a few minor changes to make it perfect. Since I was making such a big batch, I boiled the water in a big pot, and just made the recipe in the pot, also the second time I made it I used half a cup less sugar.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Baking soda really works in eliminating that bitter tea taste.  When I make this tea again, I will add either lemon or raspberry juice to make this iced tea taste even better.

Followed the recipe as stated.  My goal was to get my husband to stop drinking fake ice tea.  He love this and I'm happy that he is drinking real ice tea.  I've made two batches in a week.

Perfection! Tastes exactly like the sweet tea I've had at any restaurant down south and also just like McDonald's sweet tea. I double the recipe.

Baking soda was key! I didn't want to sweeten mine, but the baking soda helped cut the bitterness and I've been able to enjoy iced tea to cool down on hot summer days (mission: accomplished)

LOVE this recipe.  So easy, good tip about the baking soda, the tea is not bitter at all.  This is way better than the store bought 'real' brewed tea and it costs just pennies to make.  Hats off to saving money!

This was DELICIOUS. I'm an absolute fiend for sweet tea, so when I saw how many positive reviews this had, I knew I had to try it. I doubled the recipe because my pitcher holds up to a gallon of liquid, and it was hands down the best sweet tea I've ever tasted (and believe me, I've tasted a lot of sweet tea). It's not bitter and there's no weird aftertaste like the tea I'd made in previous attempts to get copious amounts of the stuff without shelling out a ton of cash.  I didn't add quite as much sugar as the recipe called for because I like a little bit more of a mellow sweetness, and I used black tea bags. I kind of want to try this with green tea too. Thanks a bunch for sharing this!

I follow this recipe exactly but use decaffeinated tea bags because I don't consume caffeine. It is perfect! When I have friends or family over who do not like sweet tea I leave out the sugar and offer lemon instead. The baking soda trick keeps the tea crystal clear! Everyone loves it

Love this sweet tea recipe!  The pinch of baking soda is genius too.  I use just less than 3/4 cups of sugar for my family's taste.

I've been making this for 2 years now, and while it's a bit more work, it comes out wonderfully. My favorite teas are Celestial Seasonings Peppermint, and Celestial Seasonings Apple Spice. The mint is just so cool and refreshing, while the Apple Spice comes out tasting like a very light cider. Nummy!

Excellent tea!  I even make it with the flavored teas and it still comes out tremendous!  I use Splenda to sweeten tea for myself but I use regular sugar when I make it for the rest of the family. One note to a previous reviewer:  when you pour boiling water into a glass container put a metal spoon/utensil  in the glass container before pouring in the boiling water to take away the "shock" of the heat to the glass. My mother showed me this trick many years ago (40+) and I haven't lost a glass container yet.

This is an awesome tea! At first I was curious about the use of the baking soda, but then I realized it was to cut the bitterness of the tea. I like honey in my tea, so I added 6 tsp of honey and cut the sugar in half (I also don't like my tea too sweet). It is a very refreshing beverage and Ill definitely be making it again!

I learned to add a pinch of baking soda to the brewed tea from a blog a waitress posted online. It makes the tea absolutely perfect with or without sugar. Just put a pinch of baking soda in the teapot along with the teabag and pour in the boiling water. It removes any bitterness. Can be served hot or iced.

I have a new addiction... LOL Great recipe, and so simple to make. Just made a double batch. And yes, I did have that fear of destroying my glass container with the boiling hot water, but a simple solution is to "temper" the water. In other words, pour it in a little bit at a time, stir.

I was unseccessful at making tea the other times I tried, and this came out perfectly. (Didn't have baking soda though.)

I really like this recipe, I've gone through hundreds of tea bags brewing and rebrewing tea following this recipe. The flavor I got was very consistent when brewing the half-gallon amount explained in this recipe, but it was annoying to brew so often, and doubling the recipe resulted in more bitter tea. I also felt this recipe was overly sweet, which can be good, but I liked stronger tea with less sweetness, so I ended up adjusting my version to produce something that worked out. 

I have noticed that the brand of tea definitely changes the quality and flavor. Lipton original black works well, but their cold brew actually works better, it results in a far less bitter taste. Using stale tea also results in some pretty poor taste, so if you really want to give this a shot, get some fresher good tea.

This is my go-to sweet tea recipe. I adjust the sugar to make it less sweet based on who is drinking it.

Very good. I've made it with all kind of teas, black, green, flavored tea bags,.. They all made a delicious and refreshing iced tea. But I do cut the sugar down to half the amount.
Also I start the process of making this tea in my 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup ( this is after breaking 2 glasses pitchers last summer while making ice tea as directed here). The Pyrex can stand high heat and quick change in temperature. Then I fill my glass pitcher with cool water and pour the hot tea in it.

This recipe is great! I used 2 cups of lemonade and 4 cups of cold water in place of the 6 cups of water for a different taste. I'll be making this all summer!!

Awesome recipe! Made this today because I wanted something different when I got home from work. It was 30°+ later in the evening and it was perfectly chilled when I needed it. Tastes AWESOME! Better than any store bought iced tea and I'm glad I know what's in it!

I followed the recipe, except I doubled after tasting the first pitcher!  I added slightly more than a pinch of baking soda because it was still a little bitter even with only 4 min in the hot water.  Also, I added the cold water to the pitcher first so the glass wouldn't break when adding the hot tea concentrate. I just came home from a Florida vacation and was craving sweet tea. No more cravings after having this! This definitely will be the only way I  ever make tea again!

I haven't had southern sweet tea before but holy cow this was WAY too sweet! I diluted it by half in the end and it was better. Maybe some lemon or lime would help cut the sweetness too. I did like how the baking soda cut the bitterness and will definitely be adding it now on.

Amazing--I have not been making fresh brewed iced tea for years because of the taste and cloudiness.  Wow--who knew all it would take is that tiny pinch of baking soda?  This is a game changer!! Thanks so very much!  Iced tea all summer long!

I am not a sweet tea fan.  However, I made it without sugar .  The baking soda made a world of difference.  This tea is not bitter at all.  I will make my tea like this from now on!  Truly the best tea ever.

Great recipe I used agave syrup instead of white sugar because it is a healthier substitute for sugar. I sometimes add a squeeze of fresh lemon to my glass when I want an iced tea taste. I love this in the summer when it is too hot for hot beverages.

Sooooooooooooooo good!!!!! I am a die-hard sweet tea fan and am very picky about my sweet tea. This is perfect! I used an 1/8 tsp of baking soda and it's perfect. Very smooth flavor, no bitterness at all. Will forever make this recipe!

Made a big batch for a Fourth of July party and it was a huge hit! I used the "adjust servings" tab at the bottom of the recipe to make 30 cups and it worked great. I didnt need to adjust any measurements due to making a much bigger batch. People couldn't get over how good it was and some non-ice-tea-drinkers said they were converted!

Love this recipe!  I used cane sugar instead of white sugar because I think it adds a degree of flavor to the tea.  I also like my tea sweeter, so I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar.  Helps keep the tea flavor when I add ice.  Thank you!

I never made homemade iced tea with real tea but I thought I'd give it a try because I was having a southern BBQ themed birthday party. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it to make a gallon. There were only 10 people at the party so I didn't expect much of it to be drunk but the whole pitcher was gone within a few hours. It got a lot of compliments! Personally, I'm not a fan but it's a nice change from the usual juice and soda served at most BBQs.

Perfect sweet tea and very close to what I was used to growing up. We actually used more sugar and no baking soda. But like others have said, the baking soda really takes the bitterness out so you don't need as much sugar to compensate. Great idea, I never would've thought of it.

This is my favorite tea recipe. I always have to make a double batch because it goes so fast. I use two cups of sugar and 5 cups of water because that's all my pitcher can hold. I do have one question though. My boyfriend bought the gallon size tea bags instead of the regular. How would I tweak the recipe so it still turns out the same?

I'm really glad I found this recipe. I used a mason jar to steep the tea and then transferred that(after adding sugar) to a plastic pitcher with 6 cups of cold water in it already. For the first pitcher, I followed the recipe exactly but it was quite sweet for me. So the next pitcher, I put only 1/3 c sugar and it was good. Next time, I think I would probably put a quarter cup. I'm gonna have to make a pitcher of unsweetened tea to mix with the first pitcher I made.

I love tea but I can not stand how sweet this is. I'm not much of a "super-sweet tea" drinker myself. I used Raspberry tea which may have changed the recipe though I didn't taste much of a raspberry. Black tea should work better but it's always a good idea to experiment and use your preferred flavors.

I've tried other recipes and still you could taste a residue of bitterness. This version is now the only one I'll use. Tastes as good, in fact better, than the one served in many restaurants.

I tried this recipe and it's not bad. I did find the steep time a little long. It wasn't too bitter, just extra strong and I had to water it down. I might either decrease the tea bags or the steep time next time, but I will make this again.

This is the exact recipe given to my sister and I years ago by our neighbor, a sweet little southern lady who would constantly tell us how we were "makin' that tea all wrong!!" She said the baking soda kept it from getting cloudy as well as taking out the bitter edge.  BEST TEA EVER!

Wonderful!  We love tea but it often tastes bitter after a few hours and gets cloudy if it sits overnight.  The addition of baking soda made it smooth tasting and not cloudy.

We make Sweet Tea with Luzianne teabags. 5 normal bags per half gallon.We use our Cuisinart Coffee maker. Bags in basket and brew 14 cups. Put in Half gallon pitcher with 3/4 Cup sugar. Try that and see what you think.Have heard of the baking soda thing, but we don't see the need or the difference if using it.

I made this to go with supper last night, and the whole family liked it, was gone in no time! I just put put some water on to boil, maybe a few cups, I didn't measure, and once it started boiling I added the baking soda and the tea bags, boiled for 6 minutes, the took it off the burner and scooped out the tea bags with a fork, the poured it in the pitcher putting a little cold water in it first because it was a plastic pitcher. I made a full gallon, and only used 9 tea bags and added about an extra half cup of sugar after doubling the recipe because my husband likes it a little sweeter. I'm not a big sweet tea fan and I liked this alot. I'll be making this again!

Wonderful tea recipe!  There is no indication of which size of tea bags but figured it must be the small size.  If using family size, you only need 2 tea bags.  I like sweet tea so for this full recipe I add a total of 1 cup of sugar!  Perfect!  Now just to figure out how to half the recipe successfully.....

I think that the baking soda is what makes this tea so good. There is a little too much sugar for our taste, so I cut that back, but that is different to each individuals taste buds.

Finally, tea that tastes like tea!  We have been searching for years to recreate the taste of tea we remembered from when we were children. This is it! We're going to add a very small pinch of baking soda to hot tea and coffee just as an experiment. Thanks so much for the recipe.

The baking soda really works! Although I found this recipe quite sweet, I would dial down the sugar. Next time I make this I'll probably go with 1/2 cup of sugar instead.

This was good, I also made a version with green tea and Turbinado sugar and followed the same instructions just replacing green tea bags and Turbinado sugar. It is a keeper for me.

Fantastic! I used 4 family size tea bags.  You can do it with 8 small tea bags and then use different flavors of tea such as chamomile or green tea. You will love it!

Took me 3 tries to get it to taste like tea lol. 2 cups of boiling water wasn't enough so I used 8 cups. 6 tea bags gave it no tea flavor, so I used 12 and let it steep for 20 minutes. Once cold, it was very good. Very much like McDonalds sweet tea.

Best Ice Tea ever. I had bought an ice tea maker at Walmart but
it just didn't make good Ice Tea. After trying this recipe I threw it out this Ice Tea was so good I drank 2 qts the same day I made it. I do agree with others to taste it while adding the cool water that way you can get the strength just the way you like it. Many thanks to the whoever posted this I think it was cookincode3.

Great recipe. I found that you can use frozen juice concentrates to make lemon or peach flavored sweet tea or others to be more creative. The tea seems to be even better the day after.

Excellent! I've followed the recipe exactly 2x and have been extremely happy both times! This took me about 10-20 minutes to make. I will definitely be making this drink over and over again!

Perfect sweet tea recipe that I like to double to a full gallon. I don't own a glass pitcher, and wouldn't want to pour boiling water into one anyhow, so I simply let the bags steep in the sauce pan in which I boiled their water. When the bags are removed I add the sugar and stir until dissolved, then transfer to my plastic pitcher and add the remaining cold water. A sliced lemon or two in the pitcher makes it extra special!

I love this tea!  I added the juice of 1 large lemon and it's perfect.
By the way, a heat proof pitcher won't crack if you warm it up first by filling it with hot water from the tap.  Just let it sit for a minute before adding your boiling water.

I had never made sweet tea before so was unaware of the cloudiness and bitterness that seem to be common. This method definitely produces a beautifully clear sweet tea free of bitterness. What a great tip! I look forward to making this in the summertime for barbecues on the patio. I did find it to be much too sweet for my taste, as did other family members, so I will cut the sugar by up to half the next time I make it.

I agree with the other reviews that the baking soda is the key.. Give this a try it is great. I havent made tea in years because the tea is so bitter you can NOT drink it. I have been blaming my water because it is terrible itself but this worked and is wonderful .... THANK YOU SO MUCH..!!!!!

Best sweet tea ever!  Do not neglect to add the baking soda.  That is what makes it taste like traditional, old-fashioned sweet tea.  I fell in love with sweet tea while attending a teaching conference in South Carolina and I wanted to recreate it at home.  When I make this, it tastes almost as good as the real deal I had in the south.  Brings back great memories of an exciting time.  Thank you for sharing this simple and delicious recipe!!

I found this recipe in a Southern Living magazine several years ago written by a man about his grandmothers tea. he said she had a special pan that was only used for tea.  I made it one summer and everyone loved and i promptly lost the recipe. I am so glad I found it again because the baking soda is the best secret..  I will make several copies and put them everywhere so I don't loose it again.

Made this recipe last night. It was delicious! I reduced some of the ingredients though... Instead of 3/4 cups of sugar, I put a 1/4 and 1/8 cup. Also, instead of 6 tea bags I only used 3. It was a success! Definitely using this recipe again.

Having made this countless times, it always turns out perfectly. The winning ratio for my family is 6 family-sized tea bags, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and 1/3 c Splenda. My husband loves this tea, so I make it A LOT! I use this method for any home-brewed tea. I especially love iced green tea. Always a winner!

I make this recipe all the time! I always double the recipe, and the only changes I make are: steeping it for 10 min (15 made it too strong/bitter) , and add 2 1/4 cups of mango or peach juice. I put it in the fridge until ready to serve, and voila! It is so delicious! I also pour it into ice cube trays and freeze them, and then put those instead of ice-cubes. That way it doesn't water down the ice tea.

I'm sure it's my fault and not the recipe's fault, but my tea still turned out very bitter despite adding the soda. I was so disappointed!

Now THIS is the tea that my Mamaw made! Good southern sweet tea. I like it sweet. I used 2/3 cup sugar (only b/c my 1/4 cup was in the washer) but it was perfect!

Wow! I went looking for a recipe after getting tired of paying $$$ for readi-made.  All I can say is I wish I had this years ago.  The baking soda is definitely the secret.  (Cloudy tea was one of the reasons I wouldn't make it).  This tea is perfect, just the way it is.

I've made southern style sweet tea before but never with a pinch of baking soda...i can totally see what they mean by smooth. No bitter brewed tea taste hidden within the final product. Smooth, sweet, southern tea! Delicious!

This recipe is perfect, perfect, perfect so don't get smart and change anything. Although, when I told my wife to add a pinch of baking soda she was a little confused. I hadn't made ice tea in 20 years and then I think mama made it. I couldn't remember how much tea to use with how much water and what to do exactly but I know its easier than making cornbread. We made 2 gallons with this recipe X 4 and it worked out perfect. Not too strong or too sweet and if you like a little lemon it's good that way too. I would call this recipe a classic. Good job.

I really liked this recipe has a starting point.  I live in Canada where iced tea means sweet tea, not like the south where iced tea is unsweetened.

I used very strong tea Twinings English Breakfast Tea my son went on his Honeymoon to England and brought back the real thing.  I tried to mix with the amount of hot and cold water suggested, but the tea was almost black, even with all the water added, so i added more water and sugar and a little more soda to cut the aftertaste.

After the tweaking it was great and will be a staple around our house.  It beats the pants of the premix (Hostess) powder.

LOVE this recipe, made it 3 days in a row, it goes fast! I cut the sugar in half and add a half cup lemon juice to taste, but that's just my preference. My husband loves it as is. My new summer staple :)

I only gave it 4 stars because it was far to sweet for my liking. I even made it with 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time I'll use 1/4. 

The baking soda cut the bitter taste perfectly! Overall, this is an awesome recipe and I'll be using it all summer :D

Absolutely the best recipe! I usually start with 4 cups of cold water and add more as necessary-- same with sugar, starting at half of a cup. I prefer stronger tea, so this always work well for me.

Never would have though baking soda would make a difference but it did. Removed the bitter taste just like every review said it would. I had to add more sugar for my taste but other than that a great recipe.

I relocated to the south and could not figure out how to make proper sweet tea. Who knew baking soda would be the secret to smooth, clear tea. Thank you for this great tip!

I love Mcdonalds sweet tea, but I dont want to keep spending money getting it, so Ive been making my own fresh brewed tea at home. I like it but it always had a strong bitter taste to it. I saw the baking soda and thought it was strange but when I used it, it made all the difference to my tea. It is so smooth and perfect tasting..no more bitterness. Thank you!

This tastes just like the tea from McDonalds!  When I make this you had better grab a glass quick or it will be gone.  The pinch of baking soda keeps the tea clear but is not detectable in the taste.  I just use the ice tea maker to heat the water and throw the bags into the pitcher and let it sit for 15 minutes before taking them out and continuing with the recipe.

I decided to make some iced tea today but noticed something was missing after tasting it. I looked up the recipe here and decided to try it (before reading the comments). I admit I was wondering about the baking soda ingredient but I added it to my mixture anyway. Well, baking soda IS the missing ingredient! I have perfect sweet tea now.

I make this for the house (I don't drink it), mainly for my son and my dad.  My sister from N Carolina says it's close to the sweet tea from 'down south'.  I use 1 full cup of sugar (the original recipe I got from a friend actually called for TWO cups) and sometimes add fresh lemon.

My whole family LOVES this recipe! My husband was a big Arizona Sweet Tea fan until I made this recipe. He swore by it, wouldn't drink any other. Now if there's Arizona in the fridge, it just sits there until I make more of this tea! Excellent recipe, easy enough to make daily.

This recipe is perfect.  I've used it for years now.  I've been bad and have been getting McD's sweet tea this summer but this is almost identical and you can control the sweetness.  For us 3/4  of a cup is just right!!  Thanks!

Very good on a hot summer day!  I made just like the recipe said too, but I think next time I will cut sugar down to 1/2 cup and see if that sweetness is better for me.  Great recipe!

This is a simple way to prepare great sweet tea.  I noticed that it stays clear instead of becoming cloudy, which I think must be due to the baking soda.  I do find it a little too sweet for my taste, but I just reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Thanks for sharing this, cookincode!

This recipe is very simple to make.  I have always liked unsweet tea, but have grown to like sweet southern tea in the summer.  And, with all the sugar it still is under half that of soda an added bonus! Only note: The recipe as is only filled my gallon pitcher slightly over half.  Will have to increase the recipe to make more than about 6 decent servings.

By far the best iced tea I've tasted. Made with Earl Grey, final product was mellow, smooth, not too sweet, and none of that bitter aftertaste you sometimes get with tea. It's so easy to make too! Great summer drink to always have on hand.

The recipe is simple but I found the tea to be very weak.  If I made this again, I'd probably add more tea bags to steep or add less cold water at the end to make a stronger tea.

Wow!  Never even thought to use the pinch of baking soda, how clever!  Made a batch & used 1/2 green tea bags, added fresh mint, tsp vanilla and 2tbl of lemon juice, 1/2 cup sugar and 3 tbl honey.  Soooooo good!  Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for the perfect tea recipe for years! I am so tickled over my tea, I can't wait to make it again. I love tea but I just couldn't ever get it to turn out just right or to be clear and my dad would even make fun of my tea! Not anymore, I will be proud to serve my guests my tea now! Thank you:)

So many 5 star reviews - and its worth every single one! Delicious.  I do not like very-sweet tea, so I used about 1/2 cup sugar with the same amounts of water/tea and it was PERFECT.  Thanks for posting!!

I really don't care for sugar in my iced tea, but my friends do, so I decided to try this out with all the great reviews.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and added two cups of ice and only 4 cups of ice water to cool it off in a hurry so I could try it out.  I may just for myself alone, only use about 1/3 cups next time. This is absolutely wonderful!!  I certainly will be making this often for my friends. This is really delicious.  Adding the baking soda was pure genius.  It is so beautifully clear.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for the first time today, it was wonderful. No wonder sweet tea is so popular. Iwill definitely make this again, I usually make my tea without sugarand I want to see if the baking soda helps it lose that sharpness that unsweetened tea sometimes has. Thank you for a new favorite recipe!

If you had asked me last week if I knew how to make Iced Tea I would have thought you were crazy. But apparently I didn't know!  This is really wonderful  and will only make it this way from now on. I love ice tea in the summer but the caffeine will catch up with me by the end of the day so I like to use flavored herb teas.  I made this with raspberry herb tea and it's to die for.

We love this tea!  The baking soda is a must.  It keeps it clear and cuts the bitterness.  We double the recipe to make a gallon.  My kids make it all the time, it's so simple.  Thanks for sharing this gem.

My family really loved this tea!  My husband says it's "southern" style - his beloved mom who's now deceased used to make tea like this, but I don't think she knew about the baking soda. One question:  has anybody used substitute sugar like Splenda?  Wanted to know if it works just as well.

Wow! I've never been a fan of sweet tea until now. Only change I made was using a couple green tea with orange, passionfruit, and jasmine tea bags in addition to regular black tea for just a hint of fruit flavor.  Having used that combo before and feeling it was just so-so, I have to conclude it is the baking soda that makes the difference.  Thanks!!

Finally, the answer to the bitterness. This tasted good even though I had to mix some orphan tea bags from various boxes. I think next time I'll try cutting back on the sugar, though (or use stevia for part of it). It's plenty sweet. Delicious!

Very smooth tea.  Reminded me of the tea I had at Ruth's Chris' Steakhouse.  Theirs is VERY smooth and I've always wanted to make tea like it. Thank you for the good idea.

Very good!  I used 1/2 cup sugar and a bit less water (maybe a cup less) and it was plenty sweet enough for me.  Very refreshing!

Delicious!  Made this tonight and used Splenda instead of sugar, tasted great!  Alternated 1 cup crushed ice with each cup of water to speed up the cooling process....I couldn't wait!!   Thanks for sharing!

This tea is absolutely wonderful!  We drink tea all year round and this recipe is great.  Taste pretty close to McD.  I have always let my tea steep in the pot, but the instructions called for it in a glass pitcher.  I followed the directions and cracked my pitcher.  (apparently not heat safe) Trying the pot method again!

If you tell folks you're putting in the baking soda they seemed put off by it. But if you make the tea, add the dash of soda and then let them try it... they love it! Never making my tea without baking soda again!

I really do like this tea. I've been looking for a  sweet tea receipe and I saw some reviews saying it's as good as Mcdonalds sweet tea, and it is pretty similar. I will definately be making this again! I like mine a little sweeter, so maybe I'll add 1/8 more cup of sugar next time, but overall very yummy and refreshing!! Thanks so much!

Absolutely a fantastic sweet tea recipe! I have been looking for a good method for the longest time and I never would have thought the baking soda makes a difference but it truly does! Excellent!

I made this tea first for my daughters tea party. The girls loved it and so did my husband and I. I've been making it ever since. I buy the Lipton ice tea bags which are larger then regular tea bags and only use 4 tea bags per 8 servings. (as suggested by another reviewer) I was surprised to see that the recipe listed baking soda as an ingredient. To my surprise it really did take the funny after taste away. You do need to put in the water though when it tells you to. I forgot the one time and thought I could just throw it in quick at the end and it didn't work as well. Thank you to the person who posted this recipe. It's fantastic!

The first time I tried this recipe, I tried it as is, and I found it much too sweet for me. So I cut the sugar down to about 1/2 cup, and it is wonderful. No bitterness at all! Thank you!

I am one of those as well who is addicted to mcdonalds sweet tea! after today I no longer have to give my savings to mcdonalds this is great!!!!! i used a cup of sugar because i like it a little sweeter that extra sugar really made it compare to mcdonalds! the baking soda does its job and takes away all of the bitternes sfrom the tea. Thanks so much for the great recipe

We went through about a jug of this tea a day during the summer.  For something so simple it turns out tasting better than a pre-made tea.  It tastes best as written, but after a few jugs we wanted to cut back on the calories some, and substituted splenda for half the sugar.  Don't forget the baking soda, it really helps to remove the bitterness of the tea. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this for a luncheon and the first person to taste it asked if I made it. Everyone raved about it.  Maybe it's the baking soda or just the right amount of tea, water and sugar.  Either way, it's now the only tea I'll make.  Thanks for the recipe!

I hosted a Southern-style thanksgiving luncheon for a senior population and decided that sweet tea would be the perfect beverage. Personally I've only had it once in Georgia, just last year, and then again in Kansas City a couple of months ago...that time with vodka. I was not overwhelmingly fond of it...until I tried this recipe!! OMG...it is absolutely the smoothest, most delicious tea that I've ever had.   The  recipe calls for what seems like a large amount of sugar, but the tea was not overly sweet at all. I'll definitely be making this again...as soon as I run out!

Not a huge fan of the baking soda, but all the other instructions and amounts are spot on.

This is so good!  A nice alternative to pop this summer.  I don't understand what the baking soda does, but I follow the recipe and it is great!

The summer hit of the house.  The first batch I made was with Black Chai tea.  My wife loved it.  I made the second with Lipton's regular tea; it was less spicy but great.

This was great! We drink a lot of sweet tea, and this was perfect. Who would have thought something so simple could yield such delicious results. This is way better than I've been making it.  I didn't have 6 regular size tea bags, so I just used 2 of the jumbo/family sized. Thanks so much!

This tea is the BEST!!I make almost three double batches every week!! It is just perfect, as I do not like overly sweet tea. Thank you so much for the recipe!! I sprinkle a packet of True Lemon into my glass and pour the tea into that-a perfect tea to lemon ratio!!

This is really good.  I have made two batches now, the only thing I do differently is, is I make the tea as a sun tea and then just do a simple syrup with the sugar, a little water, and the baking soda.  My kids love this.

This tea is amazing, and is satisfying to southerners and non-southerners alike!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough that you know it's sweet tea.  The baking soda really keeps it from having a bite.  I triple or quadruple the recipe to make it for a large group.

Awesome tea! I was skeptical on the baking soda but it really takes any bitterness away. Adjust sugar to suit taste, as written not as sweet as the tea I am used to.

I'm from the south and thought I knew how to make a great glass of tea and did not know why you would need a recipe it make tea. However, after trying this I'm must admit I'm a fan. This is how I will make my tea from now on. Something about the baking powder make all the difference.

This recipe is easy to follow and the tea is delicious! I took a jug of it a BBQ and it was the favorite drink there. I used 6 western family tea bags. Some may think it's too sweet, but compared to other sweet teas I've tried it's perfect. The flavor of the tea still shines through well.

I think this is a pretty good recipe, but it's definitely a work in progress for me. I made it as the recipe stated, except I used 3/8 c of sugar instead of 3/4. I think next time I'll use 1/2 c, but definitely for me 3/4 c would be too sweet. Also, my tea has a weird after taste to it, and I am not sure if it's the baking soda or just the brand of tea bags I used. I used Lipton family sized tea bags, and they may have been too strong (based on some other reviews). I think next time I'll use 3 bags instead of 6. Overall though, this recipe has promise!

Wow!  Just...wow!  This is how I make it in my iced tea maker:  I put the pinch of baking soda in the water reservoir.  Tea bags on top.  Before I pour the water in, I add the sugar and then dump the water in.  I don't put ice in the container.  I brew the tea and then add cold water up to the 2 qt. line.    This is the best tea ever!  Thank you!

Absolutely, hands down the BEST iced tea I have ever made or had! DELICIOUS!!! I am also one of those addicted to McDonald's Sweet Tea, but now I can make it at home! I will be making this very, very often. Thanks for posting :)

We made this last night. I wasn't expecting much, but surprisingly it did feel "smoother" than other tea we've made. It kind of reminded me of Chik-fil-a tea.   Hubby likes his tea like syrup so he thought it didn't have enough sugar, but I thought it had a little too much for me. That's easy enough to change though.

This is an AUTHENTIC Southern Sweet Tea recipe! I haven't been able to find anything close to southern sweet tea here in the west (not even McDonald's as other folks say) until now. I've used orange pekoe and green (not the greatest) and Nutcracker seasonal. The great thing with the Nutcracker seasonal is tha, if you use a 1/4c sweetened condensed milk blended to 16oz. of tea, you have Thai tea. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe and keep the tea in my fridge constantly. Thanks so much for this!

This makes perfect Southern Sweet Tea every time. The pinch of baking soda keeps the tea smooth. I usually double this recipe, and it can also be made with Splenda for a lower calorie drink.

This is exactly how I made my Southern Sweet tea for years until I discovered Lipton's Cold Brew tea bags. You make your tea just the same way, only with no boiling!!  use cold water and three tea bags then add the sugar and baking soda and stir well.  I will let mine brew for 30-min. to an hour because I like it strong, but you can go with it in 10 min. if you are in a pinch.

I haven't made a good pitcher of tea in a long time, it always comes out bitter and cloudy. I have tried many different things like using only bottled water, different tea bags etc, all to no avail.  Good sweet tea has always eluded me, until now.  I honestly thought I would have to buy sweet tea forever!  I think the baking soda must be the trick, because on my first try with this recipe the tea came out perfect!  The amount of sweetness is just right for my taste, and it isn't bitter or cloudy at all!  Thanks so much for sharing this with me, because truthfully, sweet tea is about all I drink and it sure will be nice to make it at home!  I judge a restaurant by the sweet tea they serve, and this is about as good or better than any I've been to.  Thanks again!  YUMMY!

This recipe was quick and very easy to make.  For my taste, I would increase the number of tea bags since I thought that the flavor of the tea didn't stand out enough against the sugar (I used Lipton tea bags so maybe they were weak?), but it's true that the bitterness isn't there, and if that's due to the baking soda, then hats off to whoever discovered the trick!

This is really great.  The first time I doubled it and it had a bit of an after taste.  The next time, I used 10 tea bags and it was great!

I was just about ready to go to McDonald's to get a Sweet tea when I thought I should go to allrecipes and see if there was a recipe for it. Boy, am I glad I found one! YUMMY! I didn't have just plain black Lipton tea in the house, so I used some White and Red tea instead. Turned out GREAT! I won't have to head to McD's for my fix anymore! Thanks for sharing!

This tea is excellent! I used 1 Cup sugar. I love sweet tea, and thought I'd start making my own instead of always buying it. My Husband was a little skeptical at first until he tasted it. He thinks it could use some more sugar, but I think next time I might stick to 3/4Cup or just a tad bit more.

Perfect Sweet Tea! I needed a recipe for the perfect tea because I always seems to come out too sweet or not sweet enough. I think this was perfect! Not too sweet, but just right. I also just made this on the stove. Super easy and very yummy! Thanks!

I never heard of putting Baking Soda in iced tea, its great!  I agree with the other reviewer saying it cut out the bitter taste.  - also, the pinch wasn't enough for me, I added more even after it was cold and it worked great.

This is the best tea recipe I've ever had. it's not to sweet, and doesnt have that bitter taste at the end. Plus it gets cold a lot faster then any other tea ive made. I'd recommend this to anyone. The nice part is my live in boyfriend hates tea so I get to have it all to myself. YUM.

I agree with other reviewers.  It does taste just like McDonald's Sweet Tea!  Very easy to make and not bitter at all!  I enjoyed this very much.  I think next time I will try peppermint tea and see how that tastes!

Who knew??? I've been making sweet tea for years & always had a problem with a bitter taste. I've tried every brand of tea I could find, but to no avail. Then, I found this recipe & couldn't be happier. The baking soda is "magical" & I know I will never have a bitter pitcher of tea again. Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I love this recipe! I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup since I find 3/4 cup makes it too sweet for my taste. My Brother in Law is from South Carolina and can't believe me, a New Yorker, can make sweet tea just like his Mom.

as far as sweet tea goes this one is great!  i'm not a big fan myself normally.  my husband's family drinks it all the time so he has a "homemade recipe" but i always thought it was really bitter.  this was surprisingly tasty and without that grosse after-taste which i totally expected to be there with this kind of tea.  awesome little trick with the baking soda!

Absolutely the best iced tea recipe! I added some lemon juice (2 tbs) to give it just the right taste for me.

This is the BEST sweet tea. I was always having to go to the store to buy the Arizona Southern Style Sweet Tea and that is the BEST tea in my opinion (store bought). My kids were begging me to make this tea last night and they aren't the easiest pleasers... So this gets a 5, I would rate higher if i could!

excellent recipe!  I discovered sweet tea when I moved from Oregon to Florida.  I've missed sweet tea since moving back to Oregon and I never could find a good recipe.  I like mine pretty sweet so next time I'll probably up the sugar to 1 cup but this is sooo good.  Can't recommend it enough.

My hb loves the sweet tea we get at Famous Dave's but we could not for the life of us figure out how they made it until now.  Wow! I used an electric ice tea maker, 8 reg tea bags, ice and water the machine called for, and 1/4 tsp baking soda and 4 TBS sugar.  10 minutes later we had delicious smooooooth sweet tea!  Yummy.

Can you say "Goodbye McDonalds sweet tea"?  This is soooo much better and think of all the money I'll save by making it myself. It's so incredible what one little change (ie baking soda) can do for a recipe.  Many thanks for sharing!!!!

This is perfect sweet tea!  I cut back on the sugar (my sweetness preference) and I use a combo of 4 regular Lipton tea bags and 2 orange & spice tea bags.  Very refreshing!

OK, I'll admit I'm one of the many who did not make this tea because of the baking powder but I couldn't resist because of all the great reviews. I am very fussy about my iced tea- i only drink Lipton lemon flavored dry mix or homemade unsweetened. I really like this. Does anyone know how long tea lasts in the fridge?

I was simply searching for the perfect sweet tea for my husband (I don't drink tea) and after many (unsuccessful) attempts I finally did it with this perfect recipe!! Thanks so much he loves it and everyone that comes over raves about how good it is also...if you love a really SWEET tea use the whole cup of sugar!

Well I didn't know that there were different sized tea bags - so I used 6 family sized bags and wow was my tea unnecessarily strong. But still it wasn't bitter and I don't have to throw it out. Next time I'll use 3 family sized bags though. I thought the amount of sugar was perfect. Thanks so much!

Perfect drink for a hot day! Will not disappoint you. I use the lipton ice tea bags (they're larger than regular ones) and use three. It's perfect! A staple to our diet during the hot months!

Delicious and refreshing.  This tea has a wonderful flavor, and even with what I thought was a lot of sugar, it didn't taste overly sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought it was a little bland and could be a little sweeter, but it was pretty good as is. I'm going to use English Breakfast next time I make this to pump up the tea flavor and put an extra 1/4 cup of sugar.

EXCELLENT!  Smooth Sweet Tea, just like the title states.  My husband craves sweet tea.  (He currently likes McDonald's Sweet tea.)  We had been buying sweet tea from McAlister's Deli....but it was $5.50 a gallon.  Then we discovered White Castle sold ConTea Sweet Tea (very good) by the gallon for $2.99.  We would buy one gallon of sweet and one gallon of unsweet about once a week.  I could never make good tea!  Always bitter.  I just made this yesterday, and I must report that this is awesome, and I can now make it for pennies a gallon!

This is only the second time I have felt moved to write a review. Finally I made iced tea that was perfect. Instead of 6 small tea bags, I used 2 family sized and 1 regular bag of Constant Comment with slight orange  spicy flavor because it is my favorite tea. I also used Suzanne Somers sugar substitute instead of sugar. My mom used to add baking soda to keep the tea from becoming cloudy but we did not know it took away bitterness. Really good tea!!!

Really excellent iced tea.  Since I don't like Lipton tea, I used 'Great Value' tea (i.e., the Wal-Mart brand).  I used two of the large family-sized tea bags.  The taste was great.  Like others have said, my pitcher is slightly smaller so I added only five cups of cool water.  I also used slightly less sugar.  Next time I may try it with only half a cup as some others have mentioned.  After steeping and removing the tea bags, I let the sugar dissolve in the hot tea a few minutes before adding the cool water.

The tea was ok.  It wasn't the best I've ever tasted.  Maybe my pinch wasn't big enough because I still had a little bit of a bitter taste.

Baking soda! Who knew? Because of the calories, I don't drink a lot of sweet tea. For some reason, I decided I wanted to make a pitcher today and couldn't remember how much sugar to use. Luckily, I found this recipe and learned that baking soda cuts down on the bitterness. I followed the directions on the box of tea bags to determine the number of tea bags to use and the time frame to steep. I used the amount of sugar and baking soda listed in this recipe. Being a Southerner, I like my tea sweet and would probably add even a little more sugar next time. I'll have to try Splenda so I can indulge in sweet tea more often. Enjoy y'all!

It's just OK...made twice, not impressed. First time made exactly as written (but in a plastic pitcher) it was a little too strong.  Second time I steeped only for 10 minutes and it was better but not sweet enough.  Used Luzianne both times.  Will look for another recipe.

This tea is the best. I've gotten totally hooked on MacDonald's sweet tea and this is even better. I make a pitcher almost every day.

Very good!  Could definitely tell the difference in this tea with the addition of the baking soda!  Next time, I'll add a bigger pinch of baking soda.  I don't think I added enough this time.

***Update*** Since I first made this recipe several years ago, I always add baking soda to sweet tea! Yum!

Great Sweet tea.  I don't know why the pinch of baking soda seems to help but it seems to be the secret to great sweet tea.

Really good recipe!  The baking soda definitely helps keep the tea from being bitter.

Used 3/4 cup white sugar, a little *too* sweet for us, but easily adjusted!

I've been wanting to add my two cents in here for a while, but I've been lazy. I've always made sweet tea, however, for the past month or so I've been doing like you say and putting in baking soda and WOW it's made a big difference!!! Thank you so much! The tea gets sucked down much faster in this house now.

Delicious!  Need I say more?  The baking soda really does make all the difference.  I tried that trick in my usual sweet tea and it also made it a smooth sweet tea.  Thanks, cookincode3!  :)

MMMMM!!! yummy! I love sweet tea at local restaraunts and have been craving some because it's getting hot.  Decided to make some today and boy I'm glad I did! I used some earl grey tea and only used 4 cups cool water and about 2/3 cup of sugar.  I am so pleased!!! I'm going to have to make some more tomorrow for my singing teacher who is from the south.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed it,

I think I added too much of a pinch of the baking soda. Next time, I will make sure it will be a pinch.

Lovely!!  I don't think I've ever had better.  This is so great with a mint-flavored tea (of course fresh leaves would be better...).  If it's not clear by the countless rave reviews already, there is absolutely NO bitterness in this drink.  And I did squeeze my bags :)

Very good tea! I love sweet tea and wanted some for thanksgiving, but the place i get it was closed.  So i searched here and found this recipe and it was exactly what i was looking for!  I used 1 cup of sugar and 5 cups of water.  I suggest like someone else said to add a few cups of water and taste it since some like it sweeter than others.  A+!

Very good sweet tea! It is not too sweet but just right. I also added ice to speed up the cool down process.

Our family drinks a lot of tea all year long. I have tried many ways to make the perfect iced tea.(suntea or boiled.  No powdered tea allowed here!)  Well this is it!! I wasn't sure about the baking powder but it mellows the tea no matter what kind of bags you use.(generally the cheapest store brand will do ) It is a keeper at our house. I do however cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it is very refreshing.

delicious, and as the name says...smooth!

I put my sugar, a whole cup, in the pitcher with the baking soda, then added my boiling water and tea bags and let it brew that way for 15 min., covered, as it called for. Then I removed the tea bags and added the cold water.

I used my favorite tea, Constant Comment, and it's SOOOO GOOD!!! 

Thanks! the Baking soda bit is genius!! I squeeze mt tea bags to get all the concentrated tea out, so it's strong....and this totally kept it from being bitter!!

Really good recipe for sweet tea. Thanks for bringing back memories of my mom & gramma's delicious southern cooking.
