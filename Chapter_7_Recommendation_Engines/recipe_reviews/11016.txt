Great idea to do the carrot, I'm always looking for ways to make snacks for my toddler more nutritious! I apologise if this offends but I played around with this recipe quite a bit. I bake a lot of cookies so I set out to fix the crumbling issue the other posters commented on and the turned out fantastic. Got my toddlers seal of approval. Here's what I did.  1/2 cup butter slightly cooler than room temp so still firm but able to be cut easily 1 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup peanut butter 2 eggs no milk 1 3/4 cups blended whole wheat flour 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp baking powder 1 3/4 1 generous cup of grated carrots  bake @ 375 until golden around the edges and they look dry on top. My oven (gas) took around 15 mins. Cheers! 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

These cookies were really nice. I used a little bit extra flour, since I read that the cookies kept falling apart. The first time I made these cookies, I did it without the chips, and they okay. The second time I made them with semi-sweet chips and some dried cranberries and WOW did the chips make a difference. These are really yummy, don't be scared by how many different ingredients are in it! I will be making these again for sure.

These cookies are a great way to use up some carrots. Following Cooks Illustrated guidelines on leavening, I added 3/4 tsp baking powder. Also added 1 tsp vanilla. Used two cups of chocolate chips. Also, be sure to cook for less time - 12 minutes was plenty.

I am a young woman with celiac disease who is constantly on the lookout for recipes that are either gluten free or can be easily converted.  Thankfully I am able to tolerate oats so I jumped up out of my chair and into the kitchen when I came across this recipe.  By replacing the flour with brown rice flour I was able to make these cookies without any other alterations.  Not only was it easy and convenient but they are DELICIOUS!

I am always looking for healthier cookie recipes for my toddler.  This one is great--so glad I found it.  It's not a terribly sweet cookie, so the chocolate chips are a perfect addition.  Really good and the only problem I'm having is saving some for my son and not eating them all myself!

Peanut butter, oatmeal, and carrot sounds like an odd combo, but it works!

These cookies taste great and you feel somewhat healthy eating them.  I used the suggestions of several other reviewers - decreased white sugar to 1/2c and used whole wheat flour.  I'd like to try them with raisins and/or cinnamon. My only complaint... I ate too much of the cookie dough!

Overall, a good cookie.  I think it needs a little more flour or oats, the cookie fell apart quite easily.  After i made the first batch I added more flour and they turned out much better.  Still soft and moist.  I also don't recommend cutting the sugar back.  I also tried it that way, it tasted more like a biscuit to me.  I do plan on making these again! Who knew, carrot in a cookie is pretty tasty!

As some have suggested, I used whole wheat flour, added just a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, omitted the chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  They were very tasty and interesting but too moist, they just fell apart. I'm not sure what I did wrong but I might try it again sometime.  I thought the peanutbutter flavor is kind of hidden and I'd more likely call these oatmeal carrot cookies.

A good cookie, healthier than most and a good way to use up carrots. Nice to have in the morning with coffee if I don't have time to make a proper breakfast.

These cookies smelled delicious as they were baking and I give them two thumbs up! They were sweet without making you getting a glass of milk and moist.

I followed other review-ers suggestions and made some changes. I used:
3/8c flour, 2c quick oats, 2eggs. 1/4tsp salt, 2c finely shredded carrots, 1c dark brown sugar, 1c semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2tsp baking soda, 1/4c 2% milk, 1/2c softened butter, 3/4c peanut butter. I didn't need to grease the sheet and the cookies don't spread out as they cook, so you can leave minimal space between them. When I dropped them, they were about 1.5-2Tbsp. All in all, a great recipe to use those carrots.

These sounded bizarre, but I liked all the ingredients, so I gave it a try.  I was surprised at how delicious they were!  I followed the instructions exactly as written, except I used white chocolate chips.  I love how you can taste a little of all the flavors, and nothing is overpowering.

Made these using the review written by "cookaholic" though I did need to include the milk unlike that reviewer. Extra grated carrots and raisins instead of the chocolate chips. It was alright, but we didn't care for it.

awsome cookie! especially when you make it your own! did add flour to keep from crumbling and cut cooking down to 12min but I like chewy cookies. I added raisins and cinnamon to mine just because that's what I felt like. Plan to try different flavors later (pineapple and cocconut for tropical, apples or peaches for fruity, etc.) Thanks for posting such an easy and modifiable recipe!

I love the taste and the nutritional value of these cookies, but I wasn't too crazy about the texture. Like other users, mine fell apart!  I can't even pick them all up without it falling apart in my hands.  I'm not quite sure what I did wrong. I made these before and they turned out better.  This second time around was disappointing.

I really did enjoy these. I reduced the sugar and added cinnamon and vanilla like some others. I ended up giving some away to stop eating them. I hate grating carrots tho, and I am one of those people who like to throw ingredients in the bowl and mix. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars.

Wow these were good.  As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the amount of sugar and used whole wheat flour.  I also used reduced fat butter, replaced the egg with 1T cornstarch and 1T water, and used reduced fat crunchy peanut butter.  Excellent and healthy cookies!  Next time I will probably reduce the sugar a bit more and leave out the chocolate chips (or maybe do a half batch with the chocolate - hubby is a chocolate fiend!).  For my tastebuds, the chocolate overpowered the other flavors a bit.  I might also add a bit of wheat germ to give them even more crunch!  Hubby was skeptical at first but said that if he hadn't seen me put the carrots in, he wouldn't have known they were there (from the taste :)).  Thank you for this recipe!

I'm a healthy eater who is also huge on taste. My family and I were all blown away by the taste of these, even after the substitutes I made (listed at bottom). 

The carrots soften in the oven, and the oats give them a wonderful texture. Bake them until they're golden brown--they have a fantastic crunch but are still quite a bit chewy. My only minor complaint is that they're a bit crumbly and fall apart easily.

My healthier substitutes: 
-trans-fat free/vegetable-oil based margarine (Olivio Light) for the butter
-all whole wheat flour for the flour
-brown baking substitute (Splenda) for all the brown sugar
-Splenda for 2/3 cup of the 3/4 cup white sugar
-only egg whites
-skim milk
-no chocolate chips

Just realized have been making these cookies
since 2009.  Its a good "go to" when you have
extra carrots.  I have been using 1/2 cup of whole 
wheat flour along with the 1 cup all purpose.

Yummy! Moist, and very much like a peanut butter oatmeal cookie. The carrot is not detectable  as far as the flavor goes. Also, they are not very crumbly. I'm glad for that because I made them to take on errand day for a snack for my kids and myself.

I just finished baking this.  Wow- these are amazing!  I especially liked how there is carrots in them just because its something different.  I did everything that the recipe said but added a little more flour like other reviews.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very good. Based on reviews I tweeked it alittle. Used 1 c brown sugar, 1/3 c milk, 3/4 c pb, 1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 c of wheat flour in addition to 1 c all purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda added 1 tsp vanilla and sprinkle of cinnamon. The rest of ingredients as recipe stated. These did not crumble w/the tweaks. Oh also added 1/2 c more carrots & used crunchy pb instead of reg. Flavors blended nicely. It was easy. Will be making again. Thanks for posting.

Awesome cookies!  I used egg whites instead of eggs and buttermilk instead of milk and because I was out of chocolate chips, I used peanut butter chips.  I think next time I may add 1/2 cup chopped nuts or use chuncky peanut butter.

I followed the recipe as written by reviewer cookaholic and the texture was fine.  The carrot is interesting.  These really aren't too sweet.  I might make them again with my bumper crop of carrots.

Great recipe I only added 1/2c sugar and instead of chocolate chips I used raisins. My children 9 7 & 6 really enjoyed these as well as my husband...

These were a very tasty cookie.  I had to add a little more flour so they wouldn't fall apart.  Didn't have milk at the moment, so I subbed in sour cream.  Very peanut buttery and the kids don't even notice the carrots.

Super tasty!  These cookies are great.  I used whole wheat flour, organic oats and fresh carrots from the garden.  (A great way to use up carrots from the garden.)  I made this recipe twice and the second time I filled 1 cup with grated carrots then I juiced some carrots and filled completed the 1 cup of carrots.  The cookies came out very moist.  Great cooking time.  It's rare I come across a recipe where I like to cooking time for fully cooked yet moist and soft cookies.  Thank you!  I will be making this one over and over again!

Mmmmm, delicious! I absolutely love these kinds of fruity oatmeal cookies and this recipe was no exception. I've made this one several times and it always has turned out soft, moist and flavorful. The only changes I make is that I decrease the amount of butter and sometimes I add a grated apple into the cookie dough. Wonderful! Five stars. Thanks, Marilyn!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I've had better.  I wont make it again.  There are some really bad cookie recipies out there, this is not one of them.  If I didn't know better or have better recipes, I probably would have given this 5 stars.  The texture is a bit moist after baking.  I prefer my cookies to be crisp on the outside & chewy in the middle.  I suppose you could play around with this, but then it really isn't the recipe is it?  At least you can get your kids to eat a bit of carrot.  I would say it's worth trying out since we all have different tastes.  You just might love them.

These cookies were very good. Though I would say that for me 15 minutes was too long to bake them for. I found 8-10 minutes was sufficient. Thanks.

This recipe is delicious.  Every friend I've shared it with has asked for a copy of the recipe.  I love it because it's both delicious and nutritious.  I feel good about giving this as a snack for my 4 year old.

They are OK. I thought they were too moist and not very cookie-like. They might be better prepared as bars. Didn't taste like there was enough peanut butter after the carrots were added. I did like that there were carrots in them.

Just made these and I can't stop eating them!  They are delicious.  I made pretty much as directed except used white chocolate chips.  I used a bit less white sugar and just didn't measure the flour exactly so there was a bit more than listed.  I have no trouble with them falling apart.  I will be keeping this recipe for sure.

I love this recipe!  I had read the reviews before making my first batch and decided to eliminate the milk because of complaints of maybe needing more flour.  Also I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  They turned out great!

Absolutely perfect recipe.  My 5 year old was not sure about trying because she could see the carrots, but decided to give them a try and kept telling me over and over how good they were.  Everyone I had try them said how good and moist they were.  Will definately be baking these again.

Pretty good, though my cookies were done after 9 or 10 minutes -- be sure to watch the oven with these babies!

I subbed applesauce for most of the butter and some of the carrots, and also replaced the oatmeal with the same quantity of crushed cereal (try Total, Raisin Bran...it's a GREAT replacement for oats or flour in baking recipes!)

Also cut back on the white sugar quite a bit.  The little bit of chocolate chips in the end make up for it. :)

these are good, but there is room for improvement. I think adding more peanut butter and less oats would help.

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 C and used wheat flour - we didn't think it was sweet enough for us.  However I didn't have any chocolate chips so that probably would have helped!  I really like the idea of these cookies though, so next time I'll get some dark chocolate and chunk it up to put in there.

Very good, yet not quite great.  I didn't use any chocolate chips because I didn't have any but I firmly believe that they will make the recipe better.  They need the sweetness that only chocolate can add!  I will make these again and play around with the recipe a bit.

These were pretty good.  A little bit of a weird combination, but good nonetheless.  My husband thought he wouldn't like them, but he ended up eating quite a few.  I will probably make these again, thanks.

Made a very nice moist cookie - and not too sweet. Oaty and peanut buttery, I was very pleased. I did not include choc chips and added just half a tsp of cinnamon (each to his own!)
