I like a "wetter" dish but did not want all that butter.  A good trick is to reserve some of the pasta water, after cooking, and add that in to final dish.  This works great for a lot of pasta recipes.  If the finished product is a little dry the pasta water works wonders wihtout adding more butter, cream, etc.

This was an excellent and easy recipe for someone who has never made scampi before. It was easy to follow and came out delicious. My only remark is that when we added the wine, we turned the heat up for a couple of minutes to high to cook out the alcohol and leave the flavor. We did this before adding the shrimp to avoid the shrimp absorbing the alcohol. We served it on a bed of spinach leaves to add some color and it was very presentable. It was also easy to half for 2 people (1/2 stick of butter, 1 lemon squeezed, dash of worshishire, 1 teaspoon of the wine, 1 tbs of fresh parsley, 1/4 white onion). One note is no matter how strange it may sound, the avocado is essential. It really adds to the dish and works wonderfully. I like tomatoes in my scampi so I added some but it did not work very well after all.

One word - AWESOME!  The 1 Tablespoon of salt has to be a typo, I added 1 teaspoon and it was plenty.  Didn't have any wine so I omitted that and used Parmesan cheese (freshly grated) instead of the Asiago.  Super fast and easy to make.  LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

Really great Scampi!!  I have been looking for a traditional shrimp scampi recipie and this is it.  My wife said that is the best thing I have cooked for a while and since I retired, I have been doing most of the cooking.  I, of course, made a few changes. Two more cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also cut the butter by 2/3ds and replaced it with olive oil.  Really good!!!

I know this is wrong for rating it although I changed the recipe to suit my taste. I did everything in the begining like the recipe stated. Where I changed it was I added cilantro instead of parsley and added tomatoes. IT gave it a totally different flavor, but I prefered it that way.

Delicious!  The avocado really complements the shrimp.  I've tossed out my old shrimp scampi recipe in favor of this one.

Loved it!  I could not find asiago cheese so I added some parmesan and the avocados.  I added about 1/8 cup wine but be sure to cook the sauce as called for so the shrimp will not take on the strong wine/lemon juice flavor.  This makes a pretty presentation.  It is simple but elegant.  Will make again for sure!

I wasn't entirely pleased with this recipe. The sauce came out watery and I expected it to be thicker. The cheese was also a bit overpowering. The avocado was a nice touch but the shrimp didn't really retain the flavour of the sauce- that might have been because it was precooked though.

Absolutely the BEST shrimp scampi I've ever had.  I added two cups of fresh baby spinach to the sauce at the end  just long enough to wilt. EXCELLENT RECIPE - not one bite left and can't wait to make it again!!!

This is very similar to George Stella's Anaheim Shrimp Scampi recipe available on the Food Network website. That recipe calls for spaghetti squash instead of pasta. I have made it both ways and it is delicious!

This recipe deserves nothing less than 5 stars. Anyone that suggests it has too much of anything is not following directions or measuring accurately. Perfect in every sense of the the meaning and also wonderful over linguini. Loved the Avacado addition, adds a perfect touch of color!!!

Excellent meal! I made some alterations. I added bay scallops to the recipe. Also I melted some if the cheese in the sauce while it was sitting.  I used red onion, which was a good compliment to the dish. The only thing I would add would be fresh tomatoes at the same time as the avacado when plating it. A great light summer meal that anyone could enjoy!

I made alterations to this recipe but it's a great base for a wonderful dinner--adding avacado is a creative way to add color and flavor.  I used a ton of white wine and all organic ingredients.

This was the first scampi dish I ever tried to make and it is pretty tasty, however I had far more noodles then I did sauce, so parts of the dish ended up just being plain noodles.  I used Parmesean cheese because I didn't have Asiago, but I thought the cheese addition was good.  Maybe with a few tweaks, I'd try this recipe again.

This recipe is awesome! I actually cut everything down in half since it is just my husband, 3 year old daughter and myself. Everyone scarfed it right up. I loved the asiago cheese!

Yummy!!  I followed the the directions but did take some other reviewers suggestions...I added a bit more garlic, onion and wine and not as much lemon.  I did not add the avocado, even though we love it, it just didn't seem to go with the dish.  I also didn't have asiago, but did have pepperjack and that worked fine and gave it a little kick.  I boiled the angel hair pasta and then added it to the scampi a little at a time so it was all nicely coated. YES - you will have more pasta than scampi if you use a 16oz package so just add it all together in portions so you have a nice ratio.  I have made this twice and my husband and I just love it!  The second time I had thin asparagus and mushrooms in the fridge and I cut and sauteed them and added them to the scampi and that was a really nice addition.  This recipe will definately be in the rotation!

I thought the lemon was over the top.  I agree that it needs to be cut down.  It didn't taste like a scampi sauce because the lemon was too overpowering I couldn't taste anything else. It tasted more like a Picatta Sauce.  Anyway, loved the avacado in it and I also added grape tomatoes.  This really made it interesting and tasty.  I wound up cutting the sauce in half and then adding olive oil, some more butter and chicken broth with a little more wine.  Finally got it to where my kids would eat it and they actually asked for 2nds.  So definitely good base but I did have to tone down the lemon.

This was absolutely delicious & by far one of the best pasta recipes I've tried on the site!!!! The only change I made was that I threw in some scallops along with the shrimp because I had some leftover. Also I would use a tiny bit less pepper because it was a bit peppery for my husband & I's taste....other than that very tasty & quick dinner! Loved the hint of lemon it had in it...made it taste very fresh & summery!

Okay, I needed something to make the last meal before I go grocery shopping for the week, so I cooked this up.  I had to leave out the parsley, Worcestershire sauce, and wine because my sister is such a picky eater and I didn't have any wine on hand, but it was STILL absolutely amazing!  I didn't add avocado or cheese to my plate and it was still awesome.  Very simple and light, which I loved since I don't usually care for pasta sauce.  Thank you for posting!!

Made for Valentine's Day and it was amazingly delicious!  I thought the avocado would be weird, but it worked surprisingly well.  YUM!  Very elegant dish of fine restaurant quality.  I made it exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  My SO would like for me to make this with reduced butter next time, but I worry it will impact the flavor.  We'll see.  This dish is a keeper.

I would recommend marinating the shrimp prior to cooking. (white wine, garlic, salt, olive oil, S&P). I  also add a very slight coating of sugar to carmelize the shrimp- which I actually cooked seperately in saute pan with butter.  Cooked until seared on one side and flipped for only a minute or two on the other- then set on a platter to finish cooking. Otherwise shrimp are colorless and tasteless.  Added roasted red pappers and sun dried tomatoes but due to personal taste, but otherwise good recipe.

This is the best shrimp scampi that I've ever had! The worchester sauce and the white wine really give it a great flavor.  This is perfect for a special dinner for two.

My daughter said I can make this again, quite a compliment from a girl who doesn't really 'like' shrimp.  I omitted the avacado and asiago (didn't have any) and it also kept it lower in calories.  Will definitely make this again.

I added pancetta and it was really delicious. Only change I would make next time is to not use the angel hair, but use a thicker pasta instead.

Very easy.  To mince my onions mega-small, I first sliced on the smallest setting on my mandolin, then took the knife to it.  Perfect.  When the shortcut easy route and used minced garlic in the jar and frozen shrimp.  Tossed the shrimp in frozen and it turned out just fine.  Don't skip out on the wine - that's what makes this dish if you ask me.  Dear hubby said "don't forget how you made this"  Yum-o

Absolutely delicious! Restaurant quality. I used fresh lemon juice (about four lemons made 1/4 cup), and left out the worcestershire and subbed chicken broth for the white wine.  I also used the minced garlic in the jar (about 4 tsp) and it was so good. Would make again and again. A keeper!

This is great! I've made it 3 times now and I did end up changing some things: much less butter, added 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, 2 tsp of paprika for color, more worcestershire, (after the shrimp cook) I add in chicken stock with corn starch (1/4 c: 2 tsp) to make more sauce and the most important part is to salt your avocados before you add them. I served it over bow tie pasta.

This was pretty good! I think the avocado and shrimp went together really well. I made with sticky rice instead of pasta bcuz I had with veg dumplings. Next time I will use less lemon and mince onion up more or use dry onion flakes.

I browned the butter (not all the way but enough to enhance both flavor and color), added all the seasonings BUT cooked the shrimp separately on a skillet with a dash of cajun seasoning. They come out more flavorful and looking a lot more appetizing. I tossed the sauce with the pasta, reserving some to top the shrimp, chopped avocado and chopped fresh tomatoes that I spooned on top. Then I added a handful of smoked mozzarella and voila!

Oh my was this ever delicious and SO different from how I usually do scampi.  On vacation I had quite the audience to cook for and this was a true hit!! The kids went wild over this because it included all of their favorite things plus those little extras that sent it over the top. Truly company worthy and will be making this one again!!

Excellent recipe! I add crushed red pepper for some spice (this is a MUST!) and also like to squeeze lemon juice on top of the shrimp right before I eat it. I also put a couple of extra 'dashes' of Worcestershire sauce in along with more onion because we like it.  I've made this several times at home and just recently made it for my sister in law's family. I leave out the cheese and avocado, just haven't tried it with it yet.

Made it on the fly since my planned meal fell through, no avacado the bf doesn't like and I didn't have any on hand.
This was truly the best shrimp scampi I have ever had!

ONLY USE 1 TSP. SALT.  Excellent dish and I used half basil and half parslely which was very nice. If there was too much butter for your taste, you could also cut it back add chicken/seafood stock (I use the Bovril in a can).

This delicious and quick!  I didn't have onion so I used green onions and 1 tsp of onion powder. I also omitted the white wine and I have to say it was probably the best shrimp scampi I've ever had. I also used Smart Balance butter instead of real butter since I am avoiding dairy and you couldn't even tell. The flavor was amazing.  For you shrimp lovers this is a must!

I doubled the recipe to feed a family of 5 and I still felt there wasn't enough liquid to adequatly cover all of the noodles.  I did read someones review about adding some of the noodle water for volume, so I'll try doing that next time.

This was restaurant quality and I even used frozen shrimp!  I added them in at the end for about 2-3 mins to heat them up.  I also used a half cup of wine instead of the teaspoon it called for, which was recommended by another reviewer.  I was shocked at how good the avocado tasted with this.  There is no doubt I WILL be making this again!  Next time I might try it topped with cherry tomatoes.

My husband and I enjoyed this so much we made it two weekends in a row!  We didn't have avocado the first week, so tried it with the next.  The asiago and avocado make such an amazing difference.  We've never had asiago and my husband is not a fan of avocado, but we won't make it without, now.  I even took leftovers to work the next day and added the two on top and it was just as good.  This is our only scampi recipe from now on!  FYI, it is wonderful with whole wheat angel hair pasta.

This was a good recipe! I will likely make it again to play with flavor combinations.  I did have a few small changes, mostly because of what I had (or didn't have) on hand. I used pre-cooked shrimp that I took the tails off of. Did not add the salt, because I used salted butter. No white wine, but I did add a little bit of chicken stock. Dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh. And no onion, because of personal preference. When it came time to serve, I grated both Asiago and Pecorino Romano cheeses on top with my microplane.  I was a little unsure about this recipe, mostly because of the avocado, but decided I'd give it a try. It turned out pretty darn good! It was a nice change from my standard go-to dinner dishes. My Father (who was over for dinner) also was suspicious when I put the plate in front of him but ended up really enjoying it!  One note: 16oz of Angel Hair seemed to be waaaay too much compared to the amount of liquid I ended up with. Probably will only do 1/2 or 3/4 of a package next time.  I would definitely recommend trying this if you have never made your own shrimp scampi before.

I've never made scampi before, and this was super-easy.  I'm also one of those never-measures people, so the wine ended up being several generous splashes (and the rest of the Pinot in the glass!), and 1/2 juiced small lemon was plenty.  The amount of butter seemed extreme:  I started my saute w/about a Tbsp of canola oil (or any other mild, high-scorch-point oil will do) and then added about 2 Tbsp salted butter to the sauteeing garlic/shallot (adding the oil helps raise the burn point for butter), and finished it off with about another Tbsp towards the end.  The sauce was thick and lovely, and the flavor AMAZING:  Sorry, Red Lobster, I'm eating my scampi in from now on!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written. It was an amazing sauce, the only caveat was that I made the amount of angel hair as intended and the sauce didn't seem to go far enough. I feel you should double the sauce recipe for 16oz of angel hair. (or halve the pasta, we had tons of extra pasta when we were all done, but the shrimp was gone) I also rubbed my cut lemon on the avocado until ready to serve to slow the browning. Other than that, the recipe was phenomenal! My step-dad-in-law was digging around in the leftovers...for avocado!! (He protested his dislike for it in the beginning, dismissing it as rotten canteloupe.) Highly recommended and very simple. The amount fed us 4 easily w/ leftover pasta. We served with salad and crusty bread.

This was an excellent dish.  I followed the recipe exactly although I halved the quantities for just the two of us.  I ended up adding a whole avocado as it was a very small one.   Regarding the salt quantity - the recipe now shows 1 tsp of salt but next time I would even reduce that amount a bit. When I drained the pasta, I kept a small bit of the liquid in the pot to keep the pasta moist, while I finished off the shrimp- that moisture combined with the sauce made this one mighty fine dish.  I'll be making it again. Absolutely delicious.  Kudos and thanks to "Slipmaloney".

Easy and delicious, and even though I adore avocado, I left them out because hubby can't even stand the sight of them! The only change I made was to use half the butter and substitute olive oil for the other half.  I made this for company and it got raves.

Absolutely divine! I wasn't to sure about the avocado BUT it took it to another level with a creamy texture. I mashed it up and added it as a topping. Only criticism is way too much pasta in my opinion. I would have used half a box.

I made this recipe for a group of 8 people. I reduced the butter and added a lot of wine to make a really nice sauce.  Without the wine the shrimp simply sit in the butter sauce . I was able to make the sauce ahead of time and simply add the shrimp 3-4 min before I served it.  The recipe calls for far too much pasta in relation to the sauce.  I threw in extra shrimp so everyone would have lots.   It was wonderful.  I did serve it with the avocado and asiago on the side, which were both a big hit and allowed my guests to add if they so desired.   I would make this recipe again

I loved this dish and so did my wife.  The asiago cheese has such a distinct, excellent flavor that I loved in this dish.  I think it would taste fine with Parmigiano, but those that don't try it with asiago are missing out.  I also loved the avocado in the dish, which I thought was a little strange when I first read the recipe, but I'm really glad I added it.  I did add an extra clove of garlic and about 1/4 cup of chardonnay rather than 1 tsp.  I also added 12oz of baby spinach to the scampi about a minute before it was finished cooking based on another reviewer's recommendation, which I really liked.  Excellent recipe!!!  I'll certainly be making this again.

Delicious! Followed recipe except I used 3 tbs butter and 1/4 c olive oil instead of all butter. Sauce turned out so good! We felt the texture of the avocado was not appropriate to the rest of the dish, and it didn't make sense to us in the overall taste of the dish. Will make again without it!

This recipe is amazing! It's my go-to recipe for special dinner for my husband. I do everything the way the recipe calls for but I add fresh baby spinach, and I add it with all the ingredients EXCEPT the shrimp, I put a lid on the skillet (while on medium heat still) to let the spinach wilt, which only takes 1-2 min. Then I add the shrimp until pink, etc. It's better than any restaurant dish! Don't' skip the asiago or the avocado!

I give this 5 stars- It is easy.  I used frozen shrimp to save time.  I also added more than 1 tablespoon of wine, what 's the point with just 1 tblp.  I added ~ 1/2 cup wine. Wonderful. The avacado really add color and a nice taste.

This tasted nothing like shrimp scampi! I've tried shrimp scampi at many different restaurants and they all are very similar, but this is NOTHING like it! I don't know how it got such good reviews! Never again! If I could rate it no stars I would definitely rate it no stars!

We actually found this rather bland. A tsp of white wine and a dash of worcestershire sauce really don't add anything to this dish. And parsley has to be one of the most bizarre flavors to add to anything. Our vote is for spicing it up and substituting cilantro for parsley.

I thought this was ok-good. Not excellent. I added about twice the amount of seasoning because we like spices..I also added cherry tomatoes which were good. Didn't use the avocado or asiago-sub'ed Parmesan cheese instead.

I used I can't believe it's not butter, whole wheat pasta and sub'd Parmigiano-Reggiano for the Asiago. This was absolutely delicious. The avocado added a wonderful texture.

This is a once-a-week meal for us.  It's my five year old's favorite and super-easy to make.  We serve with whole grain angel hair and toss together with the dish.  We sometimes add red and yellow peppers and/or mushrooms.  We used imitation butter, and no one can tell the difference.  Great recipe!

Anything with fresh shrimp is tasty.  If this was just a way to cook shrimp, it'd get my stamp of approval.  But the utterly insane amount of butter in this made the idea of sauce impossible.

SO GOOD! I have made it several times now and it is perfect! I didn't add the avocado, and used parm instead of asiago.  I made a vegetarian scampi one time too and instead of shrimp, used tomatoes and broccoli.  This is a great addition to my meal rotations!

This is a great dish.  Even my picky three year old went back for seconds.  Has a great garlic favor.  The only thing I will do different next time is use more shrimp.

Surprisingly, this turned out delicious despite not having garlic or asiago. So we can't wait to try this with both. We used garlic powder since we somehow didn't have garlic cloves in the frig. The sauce was wonderful.

I concurn with reviewer,Jessielude. Depending on how much you want to prepare, the sauce should be doubled or the angel hair pasta halved. As it, the quantities don't match. We also had a lot of leftover pasta. Despite that minor flaw, this recipe is elegant and delicious, a superb flavor, which I served with Parmesan Garlic Bread.

Dh loved it more than Red Lobsters! I ommitted the wine and used parmesan cheese instead of asiago. No avacodo or noodles, but served over wild rice instead. I'm drooling just thinking about it. SO GOOD!!!

I thought the recipe was okay, but good, the avocado didn't do anything for me though. I still think this recipe should be tried, I would have wanted a little more base for the pasta, but still tasty.

I made this last night and WOW what a hit!  I followed the recipe but also added a little bit of cilantro and mushrooms.  Hubby was very pleased and said that it was a "keeper".  He even got out the recipe cards so I could write it down. LOL!!

This was pretty good! I thought the addition of avocado sounded really strange at first, but I tried it and it was definately delicious! I mixed all the pasta and shrimp with sauce together and topped with the avocado and asiago cheese. My only tip is to make sure to use unsalted butter since you add a whole tablespoon of salt.

This was very good! I skipped the avocado since I didn't have any on hand, but the sauce went very good with shrimp and pasta. I added fresh tomatoes and loads more garlic since we are garlic lovers in this house.

My daughter and I had this for dinner tonight. This is a very good dish. We omit the avacado because we do not like it. We used asiago cheese and doubled the wet ingredients to make it a little wettier. We reduced the salt(a pinch)and added red bell peppers and baby bella mushrooms. We also added Mrs. Dash lemon pepper and chopotle pepper on the shrimp for seasoning.  Soooooooo good.  Enjoy

Excellant!  My whole family loved this.  Only thing I did different was using Parmesian cheese instead of Asiago, because Asiago is very expensive.  Otherwise, it was great!!

This was VERY good.  We really enjoyed it. Even our worker/guest who "doesn't like shrimp" liked this shrimp.  Because I didn't have them on hand, I omitted the worchestshire, avacado, and lemon juice and subbed fresh parm for asiago.  I can't wait to try it with the "right" stuff.  Thanks!!!

Made this last night for dinner for three adults and 2 children.  There was way too much pasta, I should have used 2/3 of a bag (angel hair).  I also had to double the sauce, even after adding 1/4 cup of wine for each batch there was barely enough sauce to cover everything.  Flavor was excellent--omitted the salt entirely.  Bought a block of asiago, shredded it and let everyone sprinkle their own on.  I also added 1 head of broccoli to the pasta while it was boiling to add some color and veggies.  All in all 5 very happy and full people, with leftovers for lunch.  Thanks!

Very bland. Very poor shrimp scampi recipe. Asiago cheese and avocado added absolutely nothing to the quality of the meal. Very little lemon taste plus addition of 1 teaspoon of dry white wine was absolutely worthless. Would not recommend this to anyone

Great recipe gathered everything for 4 servings accidentally when I meant 2. 
Only used half of the noodles for 4 servings and tossed them with everything. the flavor was great. Looking back if a whole pack was used in this 4 servings I think it would be very dry.

Very tasty, however, next time I will only use 8 oz of spaghetti. This recipe didn't have enough juices for the full 16 ozs.

Very good - I didn't have Asiago so just sprinkled on parmesan.  Other than that, made as written.  Could probably use a bit more seasoning.

Loved it! Super fast and easy- squeezed half a lemon and needed a tiny bit more liquid so added more wine. Would double the parsley for color and maybe wilt some spinach as well.

I have made this at least 5 times already. My husband and I love it. I don’t ever have any dry white wine so I never add that and my husband doesn’t like avocado and I never have the right cheese but Parmesan works great!

It was great, Italians would object to cheese with shrimp, but the addition of avocado is brilliant.  Also I added Asparagus!

This was delicious.   I did add extra garlic and sliced cherry tomatoes because we love garlic and I like colorful dishes.  I used Kerrygold butter which is a higher quality butter and I also think it gives it a better flavor.  As for the exact measurements of salt, pepper, lemon juice, etc, I rarely measure these things.  If you like things less salty or have a family member that salts everything, cut back a bit. If you like lemon, add a bit more or add a little lemon zest.  Play with this recipe to make it your own.  This has been added to our favorites list and will be made again.  And again.

I don 't know if this is the "Ultimate" scampi but it was really good. Don't forget to use the cheese on top. I added some thin sliced summer squash at the end and heated it 3-4 minutes so it wouldn't get squishy. I had no cilantro so I used my fresh basil and it turned out good. I will be making this again with cilantro next time.

El Esposo LOVED it (and he's hard to please!) I made it with pre-cooked shrimp, but based on suggestions marinated them (white wine, spicy balsamic vinegar, spices) for an hour.  Use dried parsley rather than fresh (didn't have any), and used the marinade to warm the shrimp--marking it into a thick "sauce".  AWMAGAWD.  AWESOME!!!

Delicious and complex.  I substituted shallots for onion, used more garlic and parsley, and sauteed everything for a while before adding shrimp and then lemon juice and wine.

This is really a very easy scampi and really tasty.  I will take another reviewer's advice and add a little pasta water to loosen the sauce a bit.  Loved the combo of lemon and avacado.

Wonderful recipe. I increased the butter by a 1/4 cup, the wine to a tablespoon and most important I used a shallot instead of onion. Since it's like a cross between garlic and an onion I felt it is a bit milder than an onion.   I am on a low carb diet so I made cauliflower in a grits texture. I like shrimp and grits so it was PERFECT!  I will make it again, thank you.

This was a good simple recipe with enough flavor. Our little kids ate their whole bowl. My only suggestion would to be use less angel hair. 1lb is way to much for the amount of sauce you make. Otherwise, GREAT!

I made it as the recipe says, but. I added a bit. I had Merlot infused asiago cheese. Very small cubes. Would have preferred shredded. Also my husband does not like scampi/garlic butter sauces. I had 1/2 a jar of Alfredo sauce in the fridge and added it to the shrimp and sauce mix. He loved it! I also added fresh grape tomatoes from our garden with the avocado. Definitely could taste the lemon and garlic even with adding the Alfredo. We really liked it!

I made this recipe and was very pleased. I used only a dash of salt, I substituted Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill for the white wine, and I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms. I will absolutely be making this again.

Wonderful recipe! The only things I did differently was use dried parsley (fresh would obviously be much better) and I added some of the pasta water, maybe 1/2 a cup. Next time I would add more garlic, and use the fresh parsley. Still, it was delicious and will become our go to scampi recipe. Thanks so much!

This was awesome ! I used about 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp and added about 1 Tb of sesame oil and about 1/4 c extra virgin olive oil to be sure I got the pasta dish wet enough. Also, instead of chunks of Asiago, I grated it and tossed it into the pasta  I also added a few black olives and toasted pine nuts. Mmmmmmmm ! Will definitely make this again !

I have been asked to make this for my parents so many times! We like to add mushrooms, broccoli, fresh spinach, zucchini, or tomatoes (or some combination of these veggies), and extra fresh chopped parsley to the sauce and garnish. Maybe also a little extra garlic! Be careful with the Worcestershire sauce -- too much can overpower this dish. Overall, this recipe is super great, fast, tasty, easy to make, and filling!

This was very good and I will make it again however I felt it needed a little something more.  A flavor was missing.  I doubt it was because I had peccorino-Parmesan instead of Asiago.  I think a pinch more of salt or worchestershire might do the trick.

Love this recipe... I add yellow, orange and red peppers and sliced mushrooms. I also use parmesan cheese instead of asiago.
So good, I've made it several times and its always good, fast and easy!

Very good but could use more seasoning. I used unsalted butter.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just OK.  I was looking forward to the avocado but I think that next time I won't add it in again.

This recipe was super easy and very yummy. I did not use avocado but did put in other vegetables. I think any would work just fine in this recipe. I will definitely be keeping this one.

Really tasty!!! Never would have thought to add Worcestershire sauce in scampi but it works! Followed recipe exactly except for adding a bit more wine and some pasta water to make a bit more sauce. Also added 2 handfuls of baby spinach as recommended by someone else to add some greens and capers because we like capers in our scampi. Highly recommended

I would give it 5 stars on flavor, but it just needed more sauce.  I think I'll double all the sauce ingredients next go around.  Plus I used angel hair and it probably absorbed more than spaghetti or linguini would have.  I will make this again!

Great easy recipe. I also added aparagus, which turned this one notch up. I would have never thought to add avocados, but it was great. No cheese was necessary, as the butter made it rich enough. I'll be making it again!

Pretty good -- an easy, go-to recipe.  I followed others' advice and cut the butter in half, just because we're watching calories, and we also increased the wine a little bit (just because it's good!).

AWESOME. Added 1/2 & 1/2, several more cloves of garlic (personal preference), and didn't spare on the Asiago. Also added lemon zest from the lemon used for its juice.

Asiago cheese was a little overbearing. And was not sure how avacado was to be served cold vs hot with the cheese made a confusing recipe and presentation. Not for me :(

This is one of the best scampi recipes I have made.  I cut the butter in half & replaced it with 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I didn't use the asiago cheese or avocado.   It was deelish!

I made this exactly like the recipe but cut the butter by 1/4 and halved the amount of cheese an it was just fine! I added a half pound of mushrooms because I had them. I think you could throw in whatever veggies you like. Added it to my recipe box.

Awesome! Needed to cut the lemon juice in half and next time I'll probably put more garlic and wine in it. Super good though. Used a shrimp and scallop mix.

I love this recipe!  The avocado made the dish interesting and unique.  This dish (as most are) is much better if you use all fresh ingredients.  Open your bottle of white wine to add to the recipe and drink the rest with your meal!  Enjoy!

I am only rating this on the shrimp in the sauce, I didn't put it over pasta or use the avacado.  We just ate the shrimp on the side w/ fish.  It was great!  I love that there isn't a ton of wine like some other scampi recipes where the wine flavor takes over the whole dish.  This is good, easy and fast!  ETA:  Made again about a year later and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil and added the avacado.  Very tasty addition!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  My husband does not like onions so he snubbed it.  The sauce was very light and fresh tasting (probably why my husband could see and taste the onions).  This is a quick fix meal that tastes upscale.  Will make again!

This is my nine-year-old son's favorite meal.  I don't use the avocado, but keep the recipe the same otherwise.  Tastes like what you get in restaurants.

This is a delicious dish and has a beautiful presentation. I made this as written, except i used fresh parm in place of the asiago. The only thing i will do differently next time is to cut back slightly on the lemon and the salt. I found the lemon to be a little too pronounced. Thank you for a fantastic and easy scampi recipe.

Delicious! This recipe saved my life! (not literally of course) but I had two hours to clean cook and decorate for a dinner party I didn't know about til the last minute. Everyone raved about this dish. I did add some garlic and olive oil, served with grilled asparagus and garlic bread and a bottle of white wine.

Quite honestly, my family did not like this dish.  I followed the recipe exactly (minus a tablespoon of salt)...maybe that was my problem.  Very disappointing especially after reading all the great reviews.

I've made plenty 5 star recipes that I've been ultimately disappointed in but this is DEFINTELY not one of them!  Just great ... we all loved it.  My husband, myself and my three children (one teen, 2 elem age).  The only thing I changed was reducing the salt to 1 teaspoon as others suggested, but other than that, I followed the recipe to the "T" and it was delicious.  Definitely a keeper - thanks for submitting!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I followed the recipe exactly (but I lessened the salt -  I used about 1.5 teaspoons of salt instead of 1 tablespoon and that was plenty and I love salt, I think 1 tablespoon would be too much) and this was SOOOO good, I will definitely be making this a LOT!! My husband loved it also, YUM!

I used half the spaghetti and it was still a huge meal. My boyfriend said it was the best scampi he has ever had! I had to take his word for it though since I am allergic... It smelled amazing! Thank you so much for helping to make his birthday a little extra special :O)

the shrimp scampi was very delicious! however, i thought that 1 tbs salt was way too much. I just ate it a few minutes ago, and my throat is now parched and my lips salty!I recomment perhaps 1 tsp of salt.

Great!  We didn't have the avocado to put on top.  I added a little more garlic to the leftovers and we had made roasted broccoli as a side dish and put that in to what little was left and hubby had that for lunch the next day.

I Love this recipe! I have made it several times.  I don't add the onion just because I don't like onions and I didn't have white wine, but I do add a little olive oil with the butter.  My kids go crazy for this.  Great recipe, definitely one to try!!!

The original recipe called for 1TB of salt and I found that to be way too salty. However, with the adjustment to 1tps it is much better. I recommend doubling the sauce.

YUM!  This is the best shrimp scampi I've made in a long time.  I was pleasantly surprised at the addition of fresh avocado to this dish.  I had to add fresh tomato...can't have shrimp scampi without it!  It (the avocado and tomato combo) definitely compliments the shrimp in a unique way.  I only made a few other changes (without changing the flavor of the dish too much).  I'm not a cheese person, so I left it out (husband didn't know it belonged in the recipe so he didn't miss it).  I used dried parsley instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand.  I subsituted half the butter for half a cup of olive oil so it wouldn't be as 'heavy' on the stomach and also added chicken broth in small increments as the onion and garlic simmered.  I definitely cooked the 'sauce' for a while before adding the shrimp toward the end of cooking time.  I agree with others in that you don't to taste the lemon juice and wine in this dish.  You want all the flavors to come together.  I didn't have angel hair pasta, so I just served the shrimp over a very small portion of regular spaghetti and added steamed asparagus to the side.  I know people get mad when a cook rates the recipe after making changes, but this recipe (no matter how you do it) is five stars all the way!

I'm not a shrimp person, however, I made this for my husband.  He loved it. I did cut the salt down to a tsp, a tbs just seemed like a lot.  I used a couple extra cloves of garlic as well.  My husband said he does not have to order this when we go out anymore because this was awesome!  Thanks for posting!

This was by far one of the best recipes that I have ever made. I am not a big seafood fan but I loved this. I followed the directions and if I had to, would have y made only one change.  That would be to make 1/2 of the box of pasta.  We had a lot left over.

Wow! This is a wonderful recipe. The avocado and asiago cheese really sets this apart from all the other scampi recipes I've tried. I'll be making this often. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Awesome! I halved the recipe since there was only two of us, and used parmesean and cilantro instead of asiago and parsley. Quick, easy and delicious -- I will definitely make this again.

I make shrimp scampi when I am craving garlic, unfortunately the lemon juice totally cut the garlic flavor. If you're looking for turbo garlic flavor, reduce the lemon juice or add more garlic cloves. The avocado addition added great flavor and textured.

Excellent!  It was very light and tasty.  I didn't use the avocado but that is just because I didn't have it.

Great recipe! I didn't have any worchester sauce so I skipped it, also I didn't have white wine so I used white wine vinegar instead and it came out great! My husband had never eaten shrimp scampi so when I made it he said, "why did you make that, I don't think I like that!" But when I served it for him he loved it and said it must be a regular on our dinner list!!

A little more spice would have been great! I also wish that the pasta sauce didnt wholly consist of butter. I would make this again.

Tia was really good, but you need to add the parsley the last minute of cooking.  It wilted and didn't add much, I figured this would happen but I've never made scampi before so I thought I'd follow the recipe.
Also, this was begging for fresh sliced mushrooms, maybe I'll try adding crimini mushrooms next time.  Yum!

This is one of my favorite dishes to make!  I must admit that I rarely have white wine or asiago cheese on hand and it still turns out fabulous!  I even ran out of lemon juice last time I cooked this and used lime to compensate and it was still fantastic!  The avocado may sound odd at first but it's a must! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This was fantastic. I was a little hesitant to try it because of the warm avocados, but it was was delightful. I definitely will made again. This dish will become one of our camping dishes, too, as it will be easy to fix with simple ingredients.

Wonderful! 1 tbl. of salt seemed too much so I reduced it but other than that adjustment, I wouldn't change a thing. Great recipe that was loved by all. Thank you so much.

Took another reviewers advice and used 1 Teaspoon Salt instead of Tablespoon.  Only had some ingredients on hand, so I had to get creative but the recipe was INCREDIBLE despite major deviations... I omitted avocado and garlic (I know, who heard of scampi w/o garlic??) , used red onion, was more generous w/ the worcestershire and wine.  With more preparation I'll try it as written.  Enjoy, this one's a winner!

Good recipe.  I'm not sure why so many recipes give a measurement for salt.  While a tbs might be fine for some, its way too much for others.  Always salt to taste.  If its not salty enough, then you can always add it later.  You can't take salt out.  Plus consider the fact that you probably salted the pasta water as well.

One thing I substituted was fettuccine, as I don't care for angel hair.  And instead of cooking the parsley, I just added after plating the dish as I like the fresh taste.

This was a great dish!  Was the salt amount correct? Next time I will cut the salt amount in half and add a little more lemon.  Very yummy and will definitely make again!!!
