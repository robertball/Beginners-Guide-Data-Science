These were tasty! I accidentally bought just plain honey mustard, instead of dressing, but I think it worked well. I used 'King's Hawaiian' rolls, and that was great! Love how this recipe uses sesame seeds instead of the usual poppy seeds. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Love these things! Only change I made was to use provolone cheese, and add some minced dried onions to the top. They didn't make that big of a difference, so I'd probably stick with sesame seeds only next time.

These are a winner! My husband said "These are really good, you will definitely have to make these again." I used Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site (which I definitely recommend) for these. You really could use any combination of meat and cheese you want. I did use ham, but I used provolone and cheddar cheese. Thanks for sharing!

I made these the other day with left over ham and rolls from Easter. These were WAY better than I expected them to be. I used the Honey Mustard Dressing II from AR as another reviewer suggested. That was a five star recipe as well, so I would also suggest using that with this recipe. I didn't know I was out of sesame seeds, so I used dried, minced onion on top instead which I think was probably better anyway. We all really liked these and I will make them again soon for sure!!!

I make these every year for our family's white elephant Christmas party. They are a HUGE hit. Can't wait to do them again this year!
