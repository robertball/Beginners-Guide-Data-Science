So Yummy! It's a hot day so I added some grilled chicken. Cooked with dill & seasoning salt. It made a quick 1 dish meal. My husband enjoyed it also.

Good to have something different sometimes other than our normal veggie topped grilled chicken salad.

I'm breaking one of my key rules - rate a recipe not exactly as written - but in my defense the things I didn't have were VERY close to the original and it was WONDERFUL!! I didn't have the dill or the mixed greens so I used baby spinach and a bit of dried dill. This is the PERFECT salad for a hot summer dinner or side salad. Her dressing is extraordinary! I grow most of my own vegetables so this was REALLY fresh and flavorful. THANK YOU LISAWAS!!!
