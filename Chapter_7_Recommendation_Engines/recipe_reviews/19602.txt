WOW!!!!  What a really good recipe!!  I always thought I made a mean pasta salad, but this recipe makes me want to chuck mine out the window!  While I wouldn't recommend changing a thing, I did try adding a couple of things that might be worth your time trying:  cubed cucumbers, sliced black olives, and different colored sweet peppers.  Something to note as well:  when you first make this salad, it almost appears as if there might be too much dressing.  If you chill it overnight, or even for a few hours, the dressing homogenizes itself and you have just the right amount.  Thank you, Karena, for this great recipe!

This recipe is the best salad recipe on this site...trust me!  I usually double the recipe and use two green peppers, one red pepper and one orange pepper to make it more colorful.  I prefer to use cavatappi pasta though as I think it does a great job at holding the sauce, more so than ziti would.  Everyone who tries this is left guessing what exactly makes it so good. I think its the pickle juice.  If anyone wonders how much a double recipe of this gives you, well it fits perfectly in the large Tupperware "Thatsa Bowl" which makes an ideal amount for picnics and gatherings.  This salad still tastes great 3-4 days after you make it, so make a lot as leftovers will be appreciated by many.  One recommendation I have for this recipe is the addition of grated parmesan cheese.  Just sprinkle about 1/4 cup over the completed dish and stir it in.  I also add a sprinkling of oregano.  This dish is a great recipe and minor alterations and additions can easily be made to suite various palates.  Thanks for adding such a great recipe Karena.  It may take awhile to cut up all the veggies but it is definitely worth the effort!

An extremely good recipe, receiving raves from everyone I've served it to.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time out but certain ingredients are easiliy substituted if not available, as other reviewers have suggested, such as relish for pickles, Miracle Whip (my preference) for mayonaise, all green peppers, however, it does require 24 hours for the flavours to meld properly.  Definitely a keeper and a repeater in my home.

This is the best of the best... I may have reviewed this  a few years ago but I'm not sure... I have been making this for a few years now for a hot weather meal, and no one seems to tire of it... I always use sweet pickle relish in the dressing along with the picle juce.. I have made it with dill and dill relish also as I have a friend who prefers dill rather than sweet... Eather way it is a wonderful hot weather main dish... This is my favoreite recipe form this site and I have tried a lot of them.... LANIEBABE

My husband LOVED this.  For a mayonnaise based pasta salad, I thought it was excellent, it's just that I prefer oil/vinegar pasta salads myself.   I thought it needed a whole 16 0z box of pasta, there certainly was more than enough dressing.  Also, I used a bunch of chopped green onions instead of a red onion.  I think it would also be good with shrimp instead of the ham.

I found this recipes on this site over a year
ago and its been a family favorite. Every since the first time I made it, they look forward to me bringing this salad. I omitted the garlic,were're not garlic lovers and I added a tablespoon of sugar because even with the sweet pickle juice I find the vinegar a bit tart. Overall, this is a great salad; even my picky kids and husband love it.

Wonderful Pasta Salad. Everytime I go home, my sister requests that I make it for her. I add brocoli and cauliflower and sometimes fry up some bacon and add crumbled bacon bits to it. Tastes wonderful. Sure to be a hit.

Awsome is right!  I made this up and have been eating it for lunch and it just gets better.  My family doesn't like sweet pickles, so I used sweet pickle relish instead.  But I have to wonder, what am I missing by not having that 1/2 cup pickle juice to put in the salad.  The next time I make this salad (and there WILL be a next time!), I'm going to buy a jar of sweet pickles specifically to put in here.  If its this good when NOT following the recipe exactly, how good will it be when I do?  Thanks for the recipe.

Have used cubed ham and cubed turkey!  Great either way!  I used dill pickles instead of sweet and it reminds me somewhat of a sub sandwhich. In future attempts, I may add some shredded or cubed cheese. Guests really enjoyed and we all agree its a keeper.

I used two very large red bell peppers (instead of one red, one green) and I used equal amounts garlic dill pickles instead of sweet pickles. To the dressing, I added a few spices (onion powder, garlic powder, dried dill weed, fresh ground pepper, a little hot sauce). I did not add the full amount of dill pickle juice, I just kept adding until it was the consistancy I was looking for. This makes an excellent quick lunch--I mixed it up the night before and portioned it out into small Tupperware containers (my husband took two!)--with a homemade yeast roll. Very filling. Adding additional spices really made this salad great. I did miss the addition of hard boiled eggs, I will make this again but add in a couple chopped hard boiled eggs.

My husband and I really like this recipe. We both kept eating after we were full.  I had leftover Ham from Easter and it was a great way to use it up.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little nervous about the pickle juice, but I am glad I did.  It gave it a very unique but yummy flavor.  It seems like a great pot luck to and so colorful.  I plan on making this again, especially when I have leftover ham.

This pasta salad is the best I have had yet. I made a few small changes.  The only decent peppers I could find were yellow and orange.  They gave it a fantastic flavor.  I also added chicken instead of ham.  The only negative is waiting until it chills well because it smells incredibled!!

Not bad, but I don't think I'd make it again. I could see it being a hit at a party, but definitely isn't a dinner salad.  I liked it, but the leftovers in the fridge were tell-tale signs that the family had enough.  The sweetness of the pickles with the fresh garlic was the problem.  If I did make it again I'd leave out the garlic.  It was very pretty, though!

Wow!  I just made this, and I don't think I'll be able to let it sit overnight!  It's delicious!  I used leftover Easter ham, small shell pasta, and 1/2 red onion.  Also, I used 2 Tablespoons sweet pickle relish and 2 Tablespoons dill relish (since sweet pickles are not our favorite.)  This is a winner, and can be easily adapted....may add shredded carrots, etc. next time.

YUM!  This is awesome!  Loved it!  Only changes I made were to omit the peppers and the onion b/c I don't eat them, and substitute dill pickles for the sweet ones.  I also added a bit more garlic (garlic fiends here!), mixed in about 1/4 cup of Ranch, used 16oz of egg noodles b/c I don't know what ziti ones look like (LOL), and added some shredded cheddar!  All in all, a super recipe to tweak and play with whenever you have some time on your hands!

LOVED this!!  I used miracle whip in leiu of the mayo, and dill instead of sweet pickles.  MAKE SURE you let the flavors meld otherwise the red onion will overwhelm the taste.  Thanks Karena for another great salad recipe!

It IS awesome! Couldn't wait till it chilled overnight. It is delicious right now, and we can't wait to try it tomorrow. I didn't add cherry tomatoes because their cost was totally prohibitive in our grocery store this week. I would love to try this in the summer with chunks of grilled chicken instead of the ham. This will be a regular. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best pasta salad!  We made a few changes to suit our taste - omitted the tomatoes altogether, substituted green onions for red and ditalini pasta for ziti, used only red peppers, and used sweet pickle relish instead of pickles.  I thought the dressing sounded weird with the bouillon but it's fabulous!  I agree with another reviewer that it looks like too much dressing at first but the next day it's got a great texture.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

What a great recipe. I made it for a graduation party. The only change I made was to use 16 oz. of ziti &  relish instead of pickles.  There was enough sauce for the extra ziti.
It tastes better the longer it stands.
Can't wait to make it again.

I am still looking for a pasta salad my husband and I can agree on.  He gave this a 5 star plus, but for me it was really just way too sweet.  I probably should have opted for dill pickles instead.  My husband loved it though, and ate the entire bowl in three days.

Awesome is the exact word for this salad. Loved it. Used hamburger dills instead of sweet. It got better every day..but didn't last too long because everyone loved it too. I will definitely make this one a bunch of times.

this was a good salad with a sweet dressing.  It stayed very creamy even the next day.  It may be too sweet for some people.  My kids thought it was just ok.

This was very good BUT loaded with fat.  I made a few modifications which really did not make a difference.  I used 1/2 cup of mayo, 1/2 cup of no-fat yogurt and 1/2 cup of lite sour cream. No one could tell the difference.  Thanks for sharing, I will make this one again!!

Took this to a bbq and it was well-received, but I really wasn't very thrilled with it, myself.  I cut down on the pickles but it still tasted like pickles and mayo to me, even two days later.

I adapted this recipe and it was great!   I only used half a green pepper, a handful of pickles, no onions.   Also I added some shredded carrots, broccoli, and cucumber, and tomatoes.   I used light mayo and sour cream for the dressing and tricolor rotini pasta.      My mom and I think it's terrific!!  Thanks for a winning recipe

I probably won't make this pasta salad again.  It was good, but nothing spectacular. I'll keep looking for THE pasta salad recipe.

I would rename this salad "Pretty good Ham pasta salad". I personally really liked it however there was quite a bit leftover after my luncheon was done. My husband found it quite sweet and didn't really care for it - and per other reviewers suggestions, I had reduced the pickle juice. I'm keeping this recipe, however what I may do in the future is add more salty ingredients to balance out the sweetness, like crispy bacon or olives.

Fantastic recipe.  I had to omit the ham since I was taking it to a group that included those who are not permitted to eat ham.  I used green onions and relish in lieu of pickles.  Couldn't find ziti so used Penne instead.  Many thanks for an incredible recipe.

This is a great recipe. Even my fussy asian friend who doesn't eat much pasta likes it. However, he recommends a dash of lemon or soy sauce (just kidding!). I might try some lemon next time and less onion.

Really good recipe but if you are like my husband and I and prefer more tangy than sweet, use baby dills instead of sweet pickles and add some sliced pepperoncini...perfect.

I first made this salad for a family reunion and made a huge roasting pan full. All of it was gone! I have had requests since then to make it for any family/office get together and there is usually none left. GREAT RECIPE!

This salad was good for my husband to take to work.  A little sweet, so I'd leave most of the sweet pickles and juice out next time, but surprisingly a good mixture of ingredients.  Thanks for an easy lunch recipe.

I've made this a few times and have received MANY compliments!  I don't do the garlic, and I sub dill pickles for the sweet. But, this is a great basic pasta salad, even WITHOUT the ham!

I made this for our Brownie gathering and the girls liked it. I did use only half of the dressing though since personally I don't like too creamy salads.

I have been visiting All Recipes for quite a while but never joined.  I fixed this salad and had to write a review.  This is the best pasta salad I have ever had.  I cannot believe the combination of ingredients that all come together with the dressing. Delicious.

I was skeptical of this because of the beef bullion.  I didn't have the granules, I used Better than Bullion.  This is SOOO good!  I made it because the reviews were so good, and I'm glad I did!  This will go in my regular recipe list for sure!

I love a sweet, creamy pasta salad and this recipe fits the bill.  I made this for 4th of July Weekend and it was a huge hit!  We had several picnics planned and I had 2 lbs of ham to use so I doubled the recipe, it doubles nicely and filled a plastic 5 qt icecream tub.  To satisfy picky eaters, I subsituted elbow macaroni and used onion powder instead of red onion.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used pickle relish; for fear of the salad getting too 'pickle-y' I only used about 12 oz of relish in the doubled recipe... you can always add more but you can't take it out! :)

A nice alternative to the usual "bottle of italian dressing or mayo poured over pasta" pasta salad.  The pickles added a nice twist.  Best served cold.

I loved this recipe!  Everyone went back for seconds.  I used dill pickles because I prefer them to sweet and it probably could have used more pasta, but it tasted great.  Very different from the same old pasta salad.  Thanks Karena!

This is the best pasta salad I have ever made! I usually do not care for sweet pickles, but they are awesome in this. I use medium shell pasta because it seems to hold the dressing better. Just to let you know how good it is, I made this on a Saturday (for a family of three) and had to make a double batch on that next Thursday! My husband wants to eat it with every meal.

That ham and pasta salad was so good.  My mother asked ME for the recipe.  I subbed relish for pickles...too lazy to chop up pickles. Thanks a bunch!

Thank you Karena for a great recipe! You're right about its popularity! This recipe makes a ton! The only things i might change are: Less red onion or use a sweeter variety like a peruvian red or vadalia or even to switch it up, green onion in place of it. I used bread and butter pickles, and 3/4 of the mayo called for. If anyone doesnt like the acrid taste of the onion, but still wants to include it, just chop it coarsly like the recipe but before adding to all the ingredients put in a bowl with a fat pinch of salt, stir and let it sit for 15-30mins, then rinse and taste then add to the salad.

My kids and I loved this pasta salad.   I made a few changes.  I used Barilla Piccolini Mini Farfalle with Tomatoes and Carrots pasta.  I substituted a few items since I was using what I had on hand.  I used a sweet onion, sweet pickle relish and chicken bouillon granules in place of a few items.   I omitted the tomatoes, salt, and garlic.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This was ok.  I followed the directions exactly and there was entirely too much red onion for my taste.  It was not a hit at our employee lunch.

I enjoyed it but my kids all said there was too much garlic in it and I didn't even put onions in. I thought it had lots of flavors. You really have to let it sit overnight or there is way too much dressing.

What a good way to use up left over ham!  This is a pasta salad you can add what ever you want (I added peas, cheese, cucumber, olives) or take out what you don't want.  I probably didn't put in a pound of ham but you really don't need that much.  I will be making this again & again.

This salad is pretty good. I used reduced fat mayo with olive oil and low-fat sour cream in my recipe.. I about fell over when I saw the fat and calorie content of the original recipe. I served it over a bed of greens. Note that the recipe makes a LOT. For our family, it's well beyond six servings. A lot of people said it tastes better the next day, but to me it tasted exactly the same. This is a great way to use up leftover ham, and it would be great for a bar-b-que.

My family thought this pasta salad was pretty good but not spectacular. I made this salad using medium shells which were a good choice. Next time I will use the entire box of shells and double the sauce. I did not use the sweet pickles and substituted sweet relish instead, next time I will follow the recipe on that one. For my tastes there was way to much ham, I will cut back on that too.

I don't know why every review I read on this recipe raved about it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't think it was anything special at all.  I won't be making this again, and I am disappointed that I was mislead by all the 5 star reviews this received.

This is my NEW FAVORITE POTLUCK DISH! Any recipe that you make the day before an event is PERFECT in my opinion.  The flavors take about 12 hours to really get "happy", but it remained crisp and fresh tasting.  I followed the recipe 100% according to directions except for using a sweet onion instead of the red one.  The WallaWalla sweet onion was what I had on hand. 

I doubled the recipe...and I had enough to feed an army...lololol  Not one drop was left over!

This is scrumptious!  It's the combination but the beef granules are the secret ingredient and adds so much.  Personally we like it just the way it is, doesn't need to be altered.  Thank you for adding it.

This was very good.  I could not find ZITI so instead I used the shell macaronis.  They came out still great!  If you like a little sweet taste of pickles you would love it.  My husband thoguht this was the best macaroni salad he ever had.  Thanks.

This was very well received by the entire family - guys, too.  I used whole wheat pasta - tho not ziti specifically. And I used sweet realish to taste. This will be a great summer dinner dish.

I didn't have the pickles on hand so I used relish instead and a little bit of vinegar and water for the pickle juice.  It had a strong vinegar-y taste to it but my husband and I liked it, it wasn't so bland like many other pasta salads!  I'm looking forward to trying it again with the pickles and pickle juice instead!

I just made this recipe and think it is very good, but I find it to be a bit too salty, even after setting overnight.  Ham, beef bouillon, and mayonnaise all are salty to begin with.  I don't see a reason to add an additional half teaspoon of salt.  I am wondering whether using equal amounts of sour cream with the mayo also would help curtail the salt.

I made it with mini farfalle instead of ziti, and that worked just fine.  I like garlic, but I tried the option without.  I also added some green peas to one serving and liked them, so I might add a bag to the mix the next time I make this.

If the original recipe is supposed to make six servings, they must be huge servings, because this made a LOT of salad!  I made this as a trial run for serving a crowd, and I'm glad I did, because I probably will prepare for fewer servings.  I scooped out at least 10 8-ounce measuring cups of salad from this single recipe.

This is a new favorite  I used a 12 ounce box of whole wheat rotini, and a little extra mayo/sour cream.  I only had two beef bouillon cubes, so I let them soak in the vinegar and then mushed them up into a liquid before adding to mayo mixture.  I only chilled it for about an hour before serving, and it was still awesome, can't wait to have the little bit of leftover tomorrow.  Looking forward to playing around with additions such as peas.  Thank you for this new favorite!

This sounds like a weird combo,however it is over the top delish.  An excellent and very delicious way to use leftover ham.  I totally recommend!

I'm giving this 5 stars een tho I had to adjust the recipe somewhat. I didn't have beef bouillon granules on hand or red bell pepper. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar (personal preferance). I also added about 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese (to compensate for the lack of other ingredients). We loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I just made this and it is AWESOME!  I bought some pasta, ham, and veggies so I could throw together a pasta salad for a night I didn't want to cook and came looking for dressing ideas.  I did change the veggies that are included in the recipe...but the dressing (the real star of the show here) I made as written only subbing dill for sweet pickles as I hate sweet pickles:).  For veg. I used gr. pepper, gr. onions, celery, broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumber.  The red onion and sweet bell peppers would def. make this more colorful as my salad is all green;).  It is delish and will def. use this as my pasta salad dressing fave from now on.  Thanks for a great salad!

I tried this for the first time today, and it's everything promised!  Made the recipe exactly as stated except I used garlic powder because it was all I had on hand.  Delicious!  Has a nice bacony flavor, even though it has no bacon in it.  I was skeptical of the sweet pickles (not a big fan), but the flavors all melded so well together that they weren't over powering.  I'll be making this again.

I have made this salad for several get togethers, family reunions and weekends at the lake and everytime, it disappears with gusto.  This is a great summer pasta salad - fantastic for premade dinner during the week.  Thanks for the recipes!

Not a bad recipe.  I did not use all of the pickle juice recommended, thought it would be too much glad I didn't mixed in broccoli with mine.

I doubled this pasta salad for a funeral.  I used light mayo and turkey ham. I used 2 green peppers, one red, and one yellow.  I had green onions so I subbed them.  I also subbed 5 tablespoons of sweet pickle relish.  I used 2 cans of drained, chopped tomatoes instead of fresh.  I don't think my substitutions changed the flavor of this salad.  It tasted great and makes a lot.  It would be great for a potluck.

I made this recipe recently when I had a lot of leftover ham.  I guess I should try it with dill pickles instead.  I found the sweetness of the sweet pickles and pickle juice to be a bit overwhelming.  It did taste better the second day, but overall not my favorite flavors.

I had to try this recipe as so many people wrote about it.  As I had been to the store twice already, and I forgot to put all the ingredients on my list, I had to make due with what I had on hand.  I cleaned out my pantry of partial boxes of pasta to yield one pound.  I used dill gerkins, sweet relish, and dill pickle juice.  To keep it in line with the recipe, I also added a spoon of sugar to tame the dill.  My other major sub was to use a dry Knorr's Au Jus Sauce packet for the beef flavoring.  As I expected, the dish turned out to be great.....you can make it with just about anything you have on had.  Five Stars.

My husband was so sorry that we finished this pasta off today, and I believe that says it all! Not having any ziti on hand, I used rotini. It worked beautifully. Along with other reviewers, I used sweet pickle relish instead of cutting up 15 sweet pickles, but I still included the 1/2 cup pickle juice. Finally, I added some chopped celery and cucumber to the other veggies. I thought nothing could be better than my mom's macaroni salad, but this was unbelievable! Absolutely delicious with every bite. This is definitely a keeper...and my new favorite cold pasta salad!

Very easy and tasty alternative for left over Christmas ham!  I only had spaghetti noodles and I added black olives and left out vinegar and pickle relish.  My family of 4 just loved it and we gobbled it all up!

I normally don't like pasta salad, but this was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1 cup of diced swiss cheese. Everyone loved it - even my friend who doesn't eat bell peppers. Next time will add one green and one orange or yellow pepper as there is already red from the tomatoes. Also used 12 oz of rotini primavera. Really yummy. Thanks.

I used the recipe as a base for ham pasta salad.  So I ommited the pickle relish and added a small piece of celery, app.1 teaspoon of beef base and 3 boiled eggs.  It's a good recipe to play around with.  Thanks.

This salad had a wonderful flavor!  Everyone loved it.  I didn't add the ham as none of us are ham eaters, but I did add cucumber.  Even my boyfriends daughters (who are VERY picky eaters) raved about it.  This is a keeper for summer get togethers.  Next time I might try some chicken or tuna in it and make a meal of it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good and flavorful. I followed the recipe pretty closely -- my proportions may have differed somewhat and I made a few minor substitutions.  My husband only rated it at 3 stars, but I give it a low 5.

Yummy! I added about 5 drops of Tabasco Sauce to give a little kick (I made a double receipe) and the entire bowl disappeared quickly.  My family loved it.

This one really lived up to the reviews!  I will say that my husband only thought it was ok, because he is not a big pickle fan.  However, I loved it and brought the rest into work and it was a really big hit -- great for hot weather meals.  I did not use peppers, only because I don't like them -- I substituted celery instead.  And it really does make a TON.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe as written (which I rarely do) and actually found that the pasta salad made too much dressing!!  By the next day, it was too "juicy".  My DH did love the flavor, though, so I will probably make again & omit the pickle juice altogether.

Excellent pasta salad.  DO NOT OMIT the beef bouillon.  I tasted the dressing before adding then after adding the bouillon and even shook in a bit more.  This salad is definitely more than 6 servings.  I can see adding any veggie you want.  This is a keeper, for sure!

My preschooler and hubby loved this! I added broccoli and diced mild cheddar.  I only used three large sweet pickles.  For the dressing, I used salad dressing (rather than mayo)and omitted the vinegar and garlic and boullion.  Hubby would have loved the garlic, but the kid would have said it was "too spicey Mom!"  Thanks for the recipe~

My husband and my dad both REALLY liked this recipe.  I cut down on the sweet pickles since I'm not a huge fan.It had great flavor and I'll definitely make this again.  Would be a great potluck dish.

This is one of the best pasta salads I have ever had. I had to leave out the cherry tomatoes because my family doesn't like them. I will definately be making this one again.

OMG this pasta salad is delicious. I followed the recipe with only one exception and that was I substituted diced Roma tomatoes for the cheery tomatoes only because the cherry tomatoes were so expensive at our store. My husband and I couldn't wait until this sat in the fridge to chill and for the flavors to meld. We got a bowl of it as soon as I got it put together and we liked it so much we can hardly wait to try it cold later on tonight. This is the best pasta salad we've ever eaten. I will say to those who are afraid to use the sweet pickle juice in their dressing. It's nowhere near as good without it. I tasted the dressing before adding my pickle juice and it was way to blah without it). This will be my go to recipe for pasta salad from now on. I can hardly wait for our garden to start producing so I can make it with fresh garden vegetable right after picking them. I also like the fact that it's so versatile. You can add almost any kind of vegetable your family likes. I also wanted to add my dressing was the perfect consistency using the amounts stated in the recipe. I added cubed ham I had frozen from Christmas. Thanks so much Karena for sharing this wonderful recipe with the rest of us. It's certainly going to be a keeper in my recipe file from now on.

Today was the hottest day in Michigan and we do not have air cond so I looked for a main dish salad that used ingredients on hand. The only change I made was to eliminate the peppers since my hubby does NOT like them. I added some fresh cucumber for crunch but celery would be good too.   I really loved the unique flavones in this salad, and was thrilled when my husband later said how much he liked it too. That was big, he's a meat & potato kind of guy. Our family reunion is this weekend & my decision about what to take has been made.  This will be a new summer staple in my home.

I couldn't even wait for this to chill in the fridge overnight- grabbed a bowl and already chowed some down. How could this possibly taste better tomorrow? Seriously? It's already delicious AS IS, just after mixing it! Best pasta salad I have ever had! I did not add the peppers only because no one in the family likes them but me. Might add some another time in a small bowl just for me only, but I don't know if this salad even needs them! 

Also, you can buy some brown sugar ham cut one inch thick at the deli counter, for those who would love to make this without having to cook an entire ham. That's what I did, and thank goodness I bought two one inch slices (approximately two pounds worth of brown sugar ham, mmmmmmm mmmm!!!!)instead of one, as I made a double batch of this with double the pasta (total of 32 oz of cavatappi pasta cooked. 

Sorry to the other viewers who used the sweet pickle relish, but I preferred to use the sweet pickles in the original recipe with a half of a cup of pickle juice (1/4 of a cup if you make a singular batch). I'm not so sure I'd want to use the sweet relish after eating this with the sweet pickles and their juice!

Anyhow, thanks for a fabulous recipe- I already know it's going to be hit tomorrow night with my family! All ham and pickle lovers, and both in a pasta salad? Who could beat that? Oh, and the beef bouillon granules (I used no sodium granules) tasted fabulous in this- however did you come up with this idea?

I enjoyed this salad very much and put it in my recipe file. I had some left over ham and was looking for something healthy to make for dinner. I did substitute a lot only because I used what I had on hand. I used green onions instead of the red onion, used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, used the small bagged peppers for the red and green peppers, and chopped tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes. I also used another type of pickles, whole wheat noodles and a heaping teaspoon of "Better than (Beef) Bouillon". I also used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic. I'm sure this salad will be even better the next day when the flavors merry together.

It is great.  I used kosher dills in place of sweet pickles (I don't like sweet pickles). Other than that followed the recipe pretty closely.  I back off the onion and peppers to about 1/2 to 3/4.  I plan on taking this to work for lunch I would like to not have raging onion breath. Awesome stuff.

Really different than anything I've made before. It was really good. My husband loved it. WAY too much dressing than we like but we just put what we didn't use in the fridge and made a whole other batch with the rest later. Also, didn't have sweet pickles so we used sweet relish instead. For added color, we used yellow tomatoes.

As written, I'd give it a 3.  I don't like that people rate recipes that they've made modifications to.  I made this exactly as written and the onion was a bit overpowering and there seemed to be too much dressing.  I think it'd be perfect with only maybe 1/4 of an onion, less dressing, and maybe without the garlic and bouillon....will try my modified version next time, but I do like this recipe as my starting point.  Thanks!

At first I was very doubtful about this recipe. I am not too big fan of ham.. but with the harmony of beef bouillon granules, tasted awesome! Just like the title says. Even my picky eater husband liked it. I made this as a side dish so I didnt have much time and let it sit in the fridge for just an hour. It was kind of too watery.. however it still tastes sooo good! I have some leftover from yesterdah and am so excited to bring it for lunch!

This is a good basic pasta salad.  I made as written with the exception of adding the pickles.  We do not care for pickles in our salad. The pasta, ham, peppers, onion and tomatoes work really well together.  I just thought there was a little too much dressing.  The dressing has great flavor, but if I make this again, I will add a little and stir and keep doing that until I get the dressing/pasta ratio correct.

Oh man! This is delicious! I needed to use up food instead of heading to the store on a Sunday afternoon, so I grabbed a chunk of leftover Easter ham from the feezer and started searching this site for a way to use it. (Easter ham recipe, btw, also from this site, look for maple glazed ham, really good!) Since I needed this to be a "main" meal I added xtra veggies; 2 c brocc, 1 c cauli, 1 c shredded carrot and only 1/3 of the 2 peppers since I'm not fond of those, no tomato since that's not a fave of my husband. I halved the salt and also the beef granules because all I had was soup base which tends to be stronger anyway. Used the relish instead of going out to buy pickles and taste tested it before tossing it in the frig....if it taste this good NOW, I can't WAIT to eat dinner!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I halved this recipe so I decided to use slightly different veggies (red and yellow peppers only) and onion powder instead of an onion.  Even with these changes, this is a yummy pasta salad!  The pickle juice definitely makes the dressing - don't leave it out!  I can't wait to make a whole batch and to add some more veggies to it.

This should be called Freakishly Amazing Ham Pasta Salad!  I made it exactly as written only left out the tomatoes (not a fan) and used tiny farfalle pasta (what I had) and BAM!  It hasn't even sat over night yet and I can't stop sneaking tastes!  I think it's the sweet pickles, the juice and the beef bullion that makes this over the top yummy.  I know my family is going to go nuts over this, thank you SO MUCH!

I've made many pasta salads and this is one of the best!  I did sub corned beef, added about 1 tbs. of whole grain mustard, subbed celery salt for regular salt, and used chicken bullion (all I had).  I would recommend adding pickle juice a little at a time until you get the consistancy you want!

This recipe is delicious as is.  I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it.  It stayed moist and tasty for several days.  You will get a ton of salad but it's perfect for lunch or just a snack.  Instead of buying beef bouillon cubes, I bought the Beef flavor Ramen soup for 10 cents.  This saves a little money and tastes the same.

This is AWESOME just like the recipe says.    I had just a few changes to this salad....I added a handful of frozen peas and some fresh broccoli to the list of ingredients and cut back on the sweet pickles.   It came out perfect.   Thanks for sharing your great salad.

Good recipe.  I never would have thought of using pickles, picle juice, or beef bullion in a pasta recipe.  I made a few alterations.  I used pork loin instead of ham.  I also used pipette pasta, which was wonderful.  I added quite a bit of fresh parsley and some extra garlic, and I still felt like it was missing some zing.  If I make it again, I think I'll add some crushed red pepper.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's nice to try something different.

This turned out really good, but I had to alter some things due to what I had on hand.  I used a 16 oz. box of tri-color pasta instead of 8 oz of ziti, about 1/2 cup sweet pickle relish instead of sweet pickles and juice, 4 roma tomatoes instead of cherry, and only 1 green bell pepper instead of 1 green and 1 red, and 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of 2 cloves of garlic. Everything else I used the correct items and amounts. This makes a good amount. Perfect for family gatherings. In my personal opinion I don't think 8 oz of pasta is enough,  I will continue to use 16 oz.

A good recipe for a quick meal!  Next time I will dice the vegetables and ham in smaller pieces.  I also will use smaller pasta such as macaroni or shells.  None of that affects the taste, though.  Just personal preference.  Also, I forgot to add the relish the first day.  So we tried it in it the second day.  It was great both ways.

One of the best pasta salads I ever made.  Easy and oh so tasty.  

I sustituted pickle relish for the pickles, and added a dollop of hot sauce for zip.  Worked just fine.

Warning, the recipe states it serves 6; it makes a TON of pasta salad.  I would call it 10 servings.

That said, anybody who has tasted this has asked for the recipe.

This is great! It takes ingredients I may not put in a pasta salad and blends them superbly. I find myself eating it faster and faster. It makes enough to take to a potluck without having to increase the amounts. Bingo!

Tasted great but I should have gone lighter on the mayo and sour cream (I subbed plain greek yogurt). I also only used 4 sweet pickles and a tablespoon of the juice. I much prefer dill. Next time I'll try dill pickles.

This is an awesome salad!  We have an abundance of cherry tomatoes from our garden and this is a perfect way to use some up. I only had bread and butter pickles but they worked well. I was eating it before I even had it in the fridge to set overnight. I will definitely be making this again and again. I also used a rotini to hold the sauce better. Thanks for the recipe! Fantastic!

In all fairness I changed a couple of things in this recipe based on what I had available. I left the beef bouillon granules out to cut the salt down and I used sweet pickle relish because it was already in the fridge. I also added peas because I like them.  Even my six year old who hates anything with “dressing” ate it!  Would make again!

Amazing salad! This has been my go-to recipe since trying it a year ago. It's always the first one to go! I don't change a thing in the recipe. The dressing sounds a little unconventional but the flavors work well together. It really does improve the longer the flavors have to combine so refrigerate overnight if possible.

This was great. To cut calories and stretch it, I have also doubled the pasta, and substituted the sour cream for 1/2 c milk with 2 Tbl vinegar, which didn't make it too liquidy. Makes a great base for any combo of additions..

This is a wonderful salad and, as another reviewer mentioned, you can add ingredients to your own liking. It works just fine with whole wheat pasta, just aim for a good ham as that does make a difference. To make it kid-friendly, definitely take off the garlic, two cloves was way too much for our daring 6 year old.

My husband's first comment after taking a bite of this was "This is delicious!"  He doesn't usually comment so enthusiastically, or quickly.  For me, something was missing in the flavor.  I had divided it into 2 bowls when putting it in the fridge, so tried adding Old Bay seasoning to one bowl.  I don't recommend this.  The only other change I made was that I added chopped cucumber, since I had one to use up.  I will definitely make this again.

This is going to sound dumb, but I made this about 12 years ago and every once in a while I would think of it.  Today I actually sat down and looked for the recipe again.  I knew it the minute I saw it, I remember the cherry tomatoes and the beef bullion.  I have left over ham from Easter and tomorrow I am going to make it.  This is going in my saved recipes fer sure...

This is one of the best Ham Salads I have ever made.  It is easy (just a lot of chopping) and tastes great. However it is really important that you make it the day before to make sure everything has a chance to meld flavors.  My Husband has asked for it again and the ladies at my gardening group all wanted the recipe.

Excellent pasta salad. I would say it's the best I've ever tasted. here are my changes to this recipe. I didn't use cherry tomato or red onion bc I had none. I didn't have enough mayo so I added some olive oil to make up for that. I also added some dried chives and some Parmesan cheese. It was delicious I will definitely be making this again. thanks for posting this.  ??

Served this pasta salad with pizza for eats while watching NBA Playoff Finals. Everyone commented on how tasty the salad was.  I donot eat diary, so I omitted the sour cream and replaced it with mayonasie and followed the dressing direction except for using bread and butter pickle juice and chicken bullion because that is what I had in the pantry.  Fresh veggies added were, pickled artichoke hearts, fresh asparagus, diced zucchini and red pepper.

This is my go to recipe for pasta salad- this is AMAZING and I've been making it for years. I use relish instead of the pickles, and whatever pasta I have in the pantry- but other than that I follow this recipe and it's been super popular among my family.

I had high hopes because the dressing tasted great when I first prepared it.  However when I put it all together the salad was so so.  I figured once it chilled overnight it would be better.  Nope.

Very Good Salad. I was looking for something different and this fits the spot.  Instead of adding the tomatoes to the salad I put them on top right before serving.  The salad was then not "juiced" then.  I also added chopped celery and broccoli - it turned out very yummy.

I made this to bring to an early-afternoon, family "Easter Brunch," and everybody seemed to enjoy it.  After reading the recipe I thought the flavors would be kind of intense, so I doubled amount of pasta (I used 16 oz of Easter-shapes and colors pasta that I got at Christmas Tree Shops.)  I had run out of onions so I used a tsp of dried onion flakes.  Seemed to work out fine with these adjustments.

This was an interesting recipe.  It tasted like something you would buy at a deli- in a good way.  I used only about 10 small sweet pickles and less than half a cup of the juice, only because I'm not a huge fan of sweet pickles.  I also added a little homemade ranch dressing just to give it a little kick up the flavor a bit, and I was glad I did.  I also added  black olives.  My husband was nuts about this!  I will definitely be making it again!

My kids LOVED this recipe.  It's a great recipe for leftover ham from Easter.  The flavor is different than your normal potato or macaroni salad.  It's a nice change to the typical flavors.

This recipe was just "OK" and only because of major changes.  I think this pallet caters to someone from the south or midwest (I'm from WA and Idaho) because I think there are far TOO MANY SWEET PICKLES.  I made the recipe with the whole jar of sweet pickles, and then ended up spreading the whole salad on a cookie sheet and picking almost all of them out again.  Just too sweet!  I might try the recipe again with dill pickles and just use some sugar and vinegar in the dressing to sweeten the dressing to taste. I also didn't use even half of the dressing.

This is the most amazing pasta salad(IMHO). I made this recipe as written, only change was I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. I used leftovers from a spiral cut ham. I wasn't sure about all of the red onion, as they can be really strong, but after sitting in the fridge for a day or two, it was nice and tangy, not too powerful. Do NOT skip the pickle juice and pickles (I chopped up 15 Gerkins), because we all thought it was the pickles and juice that "made" this salad so good. My husband (who was totally against it when he heard there was ham in it) is now addicted. He took it to work and his coworker said he could eat the entire bowl. I'm thinking the only thing I would ever change to this is to add cubed provolone next time. Looks like it's my new pasta salad from here on out. Thank you so much for this recipe, and to all the reviewers who posted. It really made the decision for me to try it. :)

I have made this at least ten times.  We love it!  It's a great make-ahead dish.  I did make a few changes.  The dressing is very rich.  I compensate by adding an orange bell pepper, way more tomatoes, and a little extra pasta.  I'm happy to use three or more cups of tomatoes.  The chopping does take awhile, but it is a large batch of pasta salad that keeps for days.  To speed things up, I spin the tomatoes in a salad spinner to get the seeds out, use a chopper for the peppers, and grate the onion.

My husband does not like pasta salad, my daugher in law is a "foodie" and they both loved this.  Score 5 BIG stars! I change off pasta types now and then according to what I have on hand, other than that, make it as printed. We love it!

WOAH FLAVOUR! only used 1 tomato, 1/2 red onion, used 1 green, 1 yellow bell pepper, small bunch of green onions, smoked ham, only used 10 sweet pickles, was still plenty tasty! Used light mayo & light sour cream (watchin the lbs). Next time, will add 1 more seeded tomato and i'll only use half the amount of ham called for, as the "smokedness" of it was overpowering. i'd probably use the full pound of ham if it were not smoked ham though. BEWARE of how much this recipe yeilds! the bowl pictured is a LARGE bowl, and when I had all the dry ingredients in there, it was piled high and I had to split the mixture between TWO large bowls before I tossed in the dressing! Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, do not be alarmed with the amount of dressing u initially end up with, by the time it sits overnight in the fridge, the pasta and veggies soak it all up and the consistency ends up being perfect (salad pictured was directly after it was made so may look more "wet")! Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This was amazing! The sauce for it was perfect. I used cavatappi pasta, as someone else suggested, and it was just perfect for this recipe, made the salad look realy nice! I also laid the pasta out to dry off for a few minutes after boiling so that the sauce wouldn't get watery and the pasta mushy later on. I omitted the tomatoes and added cubed sharp cheddar cheese, sliced black olives and broccoli florettes. This one is definitely a keeper!

Yummy in the tummy!  Awesome for potluck or dinner at home.  Good onion flavor, but not overpowering.  Big hit at home and work!!

I love this recipe.  It makes for the tastiest pasta salad.  Few changes: I don't like onion so I leave it out, I only use red bell pepper, and I add 1 bag of frozen peas and cubed cheddar cheese.  It tastes awesome.  I make it for work get together and pot-lucks, family gatherings, etc... and everyone eats it up!

This was very interesting. My hub gobbled it up. I loved being able to use so many veggies from my garden, including my homemade bread and butter pickles. Thanks!

I am a bit disappointed since this recipe got such great reviews. I am hoping that as it sits longer(mine only sat 3 hours) the flavor will improve. It certainly makes a lot. It's not bad, just not 'Awesome' in my opinion

My husband and I LOVE this pasta salad, it is a weekly staple in our fridge. We like to use baby dill pickles since we aren't cazy about sweet pickles. Other adjustments are, lite mayo and sour cream, au ju mix instead of boullion, red wine vinegar, 1 full pound of smoked ham,whole wheat mini pasta (so you don't have to use as much) and an extra garlic clove. I usually just throw in whatever peppers I have around and my deli counter knows to cut REALLY thick slices of ham when they see me coming. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had a problem with all of the sweet pickles. They were just way to over whelming of a flavor. Perhaps if less juice was added to the dressing it would be better.

Excellent!  I made the mistake at first of not letting it sit overnight and, boy, did it taste strong.  But the next day was absolutely perfect!

The magic is in the dressing! Family loved it on mother's day. We're a big fan of a taste of pickle too. Next time I'll change the pasta to the cork screw type instead of ziti just because we'd prefer it. I'll be making this again and again.

So good to have during barbecue season!  My family loved it.  I did swap out the sweet pickles for dill, as that is my family's preference.  But we've had it both ways and it's a winner!

My family has been making a version of this salad for 30 years.  I had every pasta but ziti!  1.  I used small sea shell pasta  2.  I used sweet pickle relish to save time  3. I didn't have red pepper, so I used fire roasted from a jar  4.  I always reserve a small amount of the dressing after it has marinate in the fridge to mix in before I serve it.

This is one of the best pasta salads I have ever tried.  Make it for every pot luck when I have to bring salad.  My son who won't eat most of the ingredients on their own actually says he craves it and often asks me to make it for him.

Excellent salad!  I took it to a family gathering and everyone raved.  I added summer beef sausage and chedder cheese, omitted the green pepper and chopped everything into smaller bits.  Just Delicious!
