This cake turns out great. We baked this to use as our wedding cake. We did quarter the cherries instead of halving them though.

I have had this cake just about every Christmas for the last 25 years, while growing up and have made it myself for the last 10.  It is excellent.

It had a great taste, but was VERY dry.  More than likey, I did something wrong.  I might try it one more time.  Thanks for the post though!! :)

I used marichino cherries and cut in quarters.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit.  People have even asked me to make it for family gatherings.

This is a delicious butter pound cake with candied cherries and almonds.  Like all pound cakes, it tastes better the next day. I used half green cherries and half red cherries which really gave it a "Christmasey" look. Hubby took it to work and said the hurdle was getting people to try it because they all suspected it was a fruitcake! I'd rename this "Christmas Poundcake" because that describes it perfectly. Yum!!

Delicious! I substituted dried cherries for the candied cherries. I plumped them in hot water for 30 minutes or so before adding them. This cake is perfect, moist and lovely.
