First I would like to ask, why do people change the recipe and then rate it? That is not fair to the person that submitted the recipe.  Second I would like to say that to omit something simply because you have not heard of it being used in traditional recipes is silly.  The tomato and bell pepper enhance the flavor but in no way overwhelm it.  This is the best Chicken and Dumplings recipe I've found, I'll look no further.  My husband also gave it a 5 star and I would say so did my 2 year old grand daughter since she gobbled it up!!!  Thanks for such a wonderful winter time comfort food!

The ultimate comfort food! The kids didn't like the green pepper(I did)-I would use green beans for them next time. I also deboned and added the chicken before adding the dumplings. Cover the pot after adding the dumpling and let simmer-the dumplings cook through and the broth gets thick.Yum!

AWESOME! My family is addicted.  Use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store for ease, so all you have to do is take the meat right off and toss it in the pot.  Also, dumplings need more water.  Here's a huge tip: when you are dropping the dumplings into the pot, use your fingers and just kind of plop them in one by one.  If you use a fork/spoon/etc, the dough just kind of seems to come apart and the dumplings won't hold shape.  Don't stir until the dumplings have firmed up or it will break all apart.

I thought it was pretty odd to have tomatoes and peppers in chcken and dumplings so I left them out. The seasonings for the broth are good though. I brought the chicken to a boil and skimmed off the foam and "stuff" that came to the top until it boiled clear before adding the vegetables. It makes sense to take the chicken off the bone and return it to the broth BEFORE you add the dumplings so I switched steps 2 and 3. The Bisquick box says 2 cups of baking mix and 2/3 cup of milk so I went with those proportions. It also says cook uncovered 10 minutes and then cover and cook 10 minutes more. I didn't want doughy dumplings so I cooked the full 20 minutes and they came out nice, though I imagine it depends on the size you make, I made 10 dumplings.

Very good 'un!  I was a little surprised though, that the dumplings go in so soon?  When I make it, I wait until the chicken is de-boned and back in the pot, then the last step is to drop in the dumplings (& cook 10 minutes covered, 8 to 10 more unconvered)..  Still, your recipe had really great home-cookin' ingredients!

Excellent recipe.  This recipe produced the best chicken stock I had ever tasted...My boyfriend had 4 helpings the first night.

I made the following changes:  added garlic and a cap full of Mrs. Dash for some extra flavor, omitted the tomatoes/green peppers, added frozen peas right before I put the dumplings in and I cooked the dumplings for 5 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered.

A well-crafted recipe!  I would remove and clean the whole chicken before dropping in the dough the next time I made it.

Turned out great, but the dumplings seemed too sweet and too fluffy.  I was raised on the sticky/gummy kind of dumpling and I guess I have grown used to it.  Definitely a keeper though - next time I will switch brands of buttermilk mix.  It was a great suggestion to de-bone before adding the dumplings as it would have been difficult to do afterwards.

Very good down-home cooking.  I make this on chilly nights or when someone isn't feeling great. Just the smell that comes out of that pot is enough to make you feel 100% better.

The soup itself was delicious but the dumplings were impossible. I followed the recipe exactly and all I ended up with was goop.

The dumplings didnt form/stick quite like I thought that would but it didn't matter. It ended up thickening the soup very nicely and the flavor is amazing. One of the best chicken and dumplings I've ever eaten. Will certainly make this again soon.

I only used the first 12 ingredients of this recipe for making my chicken in the slow cooker.  This chicken had great flavor and I will definitely use it again! Then used the recipe for Herbed Dumplings from this site since I didn't have baking mix.

I've made this numerous times.  I do add more veggies (onions, celery, carrots & potatoes) and extra chicken stock. I never add the tomatoes or the peppers, so I cannot say it is better without them, but to me they seem like they do not belong in this soup.  Otherwise I make it as is, other than sometimes adding peas. This is perfect cold weather soup, and makes a big pot that I eat for lunch for days. I never get tired of it!  I do use a store bought rotisserie chicken to make my life easier and it makes this soup a snap to make.   Very, very good.

I have tried many chicken & dumpling recipes and this is the BEST I have ever tasted.  I was very sick with some stupid virus, picked up the ingredients, and SICK made this recipe as my grandmother always said, "Nothing makes you feel better like a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup."  Yes, I did add frozen egg noodles and substituted buttermilk for milk in dumplings (I bought the wrong darn mix).  I made it to work the next day feeling 100 percent better and took leftovers for lunch...everyone in office just "drooled" as the smell wafted through the office!  Now I have to bring a big pot to work...

Great recipe!  All I did was triple the water and add more veggies (green beans, yellow & red pepper, broccoli) to up the nutrition factor and it turned out so well!  Even my most critical friend loved it and took leftovers home.

Delicious.  Omitted the carrots since I didn't have any on hand, but otherwise made as written.  The entire family enjoyed this. We'll make again as a way to use leftover chicken.

Ok I simplified this to fit my tastes..  First i ommitted the green peppers and tomatoes, just doesn't fit for me.    I used 5 cups of broth/water & boullion so that it had a bit more gravy.    I deboned my chicken and added it to the broth before dropping the dumplings.  Also, to make the gravy a bit thicker I added a heaping tablespoon or so of the bisquick mix and just mixed with some water and threw it in to thicken up the sauce.    I just used tried and true bisquick for my dumplings, 2 1/4 C mix and 2/3 cup of milk and spoon drop them into the broth.   This is my go to recipe with the small changes I made....this is the real deal.    I can't believe people on this site love the slow cooker version of chicken and dumplings so much.  To me the taste of that is bland and the dumplings are slimy and doughy.  This is the homemade style I grew up on and worth the time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as a base recipe. I dont think personally that tomatoes and green peppers belong in a chicken and dumplings meal, so did not add them. 
I added a few more herbs as personal choice and it was really good,
I find it easier however to cook the chicken first without any other ingrediant, then shred it, and put in the veg/herbs/ and anything else you want back into the liquid. I like a thicker base so did use flour to thicken it up a bit.  I also used my own dumplings mix. For those having a problem with the dumpling going gooey or liquidy, make sure the fluid is piping hot!  Cover the dumplings and try cooking for 15 mins, do not remove the lid or they will go flat!

I absolutely prefer light & fluffy dumplings! I'd lost my buttermilk dumpling recipe and was so happy to find this recipe. Even lighter would be using White Lily self-rising flour with real buttermilk - but these are light enough! I'm not a gummy, sticky dumpling fan - those things are lead in the belly.

It came out more like chicken soup. I prefer a creamier chicken and dumplings. I used a can of cream of chicken instead of the chicken base. Also the ingredient list the chicken stock butnot in the directions. Also the dumplings came out tasteless but I am sure it was my fault. I will look elsewhere for another recipe however.

Absolutely WONDERFUL.  I didnt change a thing except that I used season salt instead of table salt.  I have always made homemade ckn and dumplings but was looking for something different for a change.  I will definitely keep this in my rotation.  I dont eat bell peppers but I use them to cook with for the flavor quite often..  I think that was the best part of the recipe!  GREAT FOOD

I followed the recipe as written but the result came out way too salty and did not include enough broth/liquid. My chicken was half the size and there was barely enough liquid to cover the contents in the pot. The water should easily be doubled, and even tripled, from the current 3 cups. With adding more water, I would add maybe 1 or 2 more bouillon cubes but no more than that. I am willing to try this recipe again because I love the herbs it calls for. It has potential. (Note: I did not include the dumplings, so my rating is based solely on the stew part.)

The perfect dish for a chilly night.  This was really excellent, though very filling.  I didn't change a thing, except to remove the chicken, debone, chop & return it to the pot before adding the dumplings, it's easier & then you won't disturb the dumplings on top of the soup.  Never made them before so I was surprised to see how they puff up and fill the top of the soup. I also used a Tbsp to make them.

First of all, putting the raw chicken, broth and all seasonings in to begin with was not a good idea.  I had to strain the broth and re add all the seasonings except the salt. dumplings? don't know what altitude this recipe is meant for, but 2 cups of baking mix (buttermilk baking mix? biggest store in my city doesn't have that), 1 cup milk, 1/8 tsp parsley?  I used a nice amount to make it worth while adding. whatever, except for using all purpose baking mix and more parsley I followed the recipe and had consistency of pancake mix. how you supposed to roll pancake mix into balls? dumplings never developed. This recipe was a huge loser. even with re adding seasonings, it was bland.

This was a delicious recipe.  I made a few adjustments though.  To make things easier, I used 4 boneless chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken.  I also added half and half to the broth to thicken it up and give it a creamy texture.  All of the spices I kept the same and I used 2 bunches of green onions in place of the onion.  For the dumplings, I used Bisquick instant mix and they couldn't have been easier and tastier.  My husband loved this and we have leftovers too =)

The only problem that I had with this recipe is that it does not mention when to add the chicken broth!  

Very delicious!  My family loved it!

OK, I made a few changes. Instead of chicken, I used sausage and ground beef. I swapped a tomato sauce for the chicken broth. And I switched up the dumplings for pasta. Idk why they called this chicken and dumplings when it tasted a lot like speghetti!! OK, jokes over. I get tired of people changing the recipe then rating it. LOL This is a great comfort food recipe. Change nothing, it's a delight as it is. Michelle does it absolutely right. :D

Very good, and yes, very hearty!  I was full halfway through the meal!  I let mine simmer pretty much all day on low and the carrots made the broth kind of orange . . .no matter, was very tasty! I didn't have peppers or I would've tossed them in.  The directions really don't say when to put the chicken broth in . . .I just added it with the veggies, as there wasn't enough liquid in the soup otherwise.  I also just made my own baking mix out of flour and baking soda.  I ran out of parsley, otherwise it definitely wouldve been in the dumplings . . .I love parsley in stuff!  Very hearty, makes a ton, and it is a great comfor meal when I'm not feeling so great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did as the others and removed the chicken before adding the dumplings. My dumplings did not turn out at all.  I followed the recipe and ended up with a pancake like consistency, so I added more biscuit mix.  Then after cooking the dumplings they never cooked.  They stayed really flour-y and gooey.  I tried cooking htem longer and they dissappeared into the broth.   I am used to Chicken and Dumplings made with refrigerated Biscuits- so maybe that is why.  But I tried Chkn and Dumplings at Cracker Barrel and wanted to try them.   I won't be making this recipe again, but I might try another.

Good but too salty.  That could be me thinking I needed to add the condensed chicken broth at the end.  Regular broth or low sodium broth would have been good.

Very tasty and hearty dish. The seasoning amount in the recipe seemed very low so I incresed the thyme and rub, I imagine it might have been a little bland otherwise. I wasn't too crazy about the green peppers, I'll make it again with peas instead. Like others noted I removed the chicken and cut up, returned to pot before dropping in the dumplings. It would have been incredibly messy to try to do it after. Next time I'll reduce the amount of time to cook the veggies too, they were a little mushy.

My picky husband, who claims to have never had chicken and dumplings before, loved it. I did add some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper for some heat. And I added cornstarch to thicken it. This was great for a cold day.

Great recipe! I was looking for something without milk/milk products in it due to an allergy in the family. I was able to substitute soy milk without a significant change in flavor. Also, I used jiffy pancake mix instead of buttermilk baking mix. I eliminated the green pepper, did a peas/carrots mix instead of just carrots. I followed the suggestion of deboning and cutting the chicken before adding the dumplings. This will go into our meal rotation.

This was a terrific recipe.  I didn't know when to add the chicken broth so it was added with the water in the beginning.  I used red pepper instead of green.  The chicken turned out so moist.  I followed others advise and removed the chicken, deboned and chopped it, then added it back to the broth before making dumplings.  I also thickened the broth with a roux to make it less soupy.  I couldn't find any standard buttermilk mix and thought pancake mix might not work so well.  I did find a wheat buttermilk mix made by Red Mill.  The dumplings turned out fabulous.  5 minutes is not enough time though.  I simmered them over med heat covered for 5 minutes then I removed the cover and continued simmering them for another 5 minutes.  
My family loved this recipe.  I would add the vegetables the last 1/2 hour of cooking the chicken next time.  They were very soft.

this was very good and easy to make (even though it does take a lot of prep and time).  i used a food processor to chop the veggies, which helped, and i added the can of chicken broth in the very beginning (with water & bouillon).  it could have been more savory, though.  i'd like to play around with the spices.

I made this in the crockpot, so the issue of when to add the broth was moot. It was delicious, and my kids (2 and 1)each found at least one vegetable to eat in the mix, and liked the dumplings.  (I added spinach too.)

I thought this recipe was excellent.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and made some delicious broth.  I found using 3 cups of water to make stock not enough.  Perhaps the can of broth that one reviewer mentioned no directions for could be added to the pot while the chicken cooks.

My first chicken and dumpling attempt. I used this recipe for the dumplings. The recipe called for too much milk. I could not roll my dumplings into balls because the mixture was too liquid, so I had to add more flour and biscuit mix. I was unsuccessful in making actual dumpling balls, but even though they were very mis-shaped, they turned out really good. I will be using this recipe again. I also went with the rotisserie chicken to make it easier. Yes, I'm lazy.

YUMMO!  Not only was this recipe easy, but very good as well!  I'm a true Southerner and this recipe is even better than my Mom's!  I seasoned the water that I boiled my chicken in with onions, celery, thyme and salt/pepper.  Then added the 1 can cream chicken and 1 can cream celery.  Worked great and my kids gobbled it up!  Will definately make this one alot this winter!

My family loved this, the only complaint was not enough dumplings.  I used a 6lb. chicken so increased the liquid by a few cups, but still was very tasty.  I also removed the chicken before adding dumplings.  I also only added half the vegetables while cooking the chicken and added the rest after removing chicken and reheated to a nice simmer to add the dumplings.  Will definitely make this again soon!!!

The flavor was allright. I've had better flavorful recipes before. And I didnt' like the "Soupiness" of it. I like creamier types. Thank you..but I'll keep searching for a recipe.

This is a very "homey" soup.  Great on a cold winter day.  Very flavorful.  A meal in itself.

I love this! Turned out great. I tried to post a photo but it kept saying my photo was too small?? Either way amazing. My whole house smells great too. I didn’t add celery only because I don’t like celery. It didn’t list where to add the canned chicken broth.. so I added it with the veggies (that’s when I realized it hadn’t been used). Everything is amazing.

VERY good!  I agree with the other reviews : de-bone the chicken before adding the dumplings.  Then, cook the dumplings for 10 mins with the lid on, turn them over and then cook 10 mins more with the lid off.   The prep was A LOT longer than stated...chopping the veggies, de-boning the chicken and making the dumplings takes a while.  It's good that this can all be done with the food is cooking.

Only thing I changed was to leave out the tomatoes and green peppers, and I also used chicken hindquarters instead of the whole chicken.  It was a definite hit and will be made again for sure!!

My only complaint about this recipe is the instructions didn't tell you when to add the condensed chicken broth.  I assumed you added it in the beginning.  The dumplings turned out a little gooey like pancake batter.  I added a little more flour and dropped spoonfuls into the pot instead of forming into balls.  The flavors were great though.  I think next time I will add more water and more pepper.

Excellent recipe!  I omitted the green pepper and tomato but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Probably the best chicken and dumplings I've ever made.  We ate until we were stuffed!  Will definitely make again!

Great flavor! Delicious! I made a few changes to the dumplings. I forgot to add the pepper to the dumplings and I left out the parsley because my husband is not a fan. I also cooked the dumplings a little longer than the 5 minutes. Will make again!

I was excited to try this recipe, but it just ended up frustrating me. I followed it exactly, but there were some missing steps. First of all, it says no where in the recipe when to use the chicken broth. I ended up putting it in, in the beginning. Also, the dumpling recipe didn't work at all. I ended up with a soupy, pancake consistency. I had to add more mix until I could make it into "balls". The recipe didn't say what size balls, and once I dropped them in they poofed up so much that they overtook the meal. 

I ended up adding some flour to thicken the soup up as well as some cream, plus a lot more seasonings. It was thin and bland. In the end it was OK, but not worth the fuss.

My main problem with this recipe is the poor directions. Won't make it again.

I gave this a four star because it needs some modifications.  Much easier to use boneless skinless chicken breasts, simmer in 1 inch water until done.  Or cook the whole chicken seperately and add the meat, rather than trying to debone the meat after the whole thing is made.  Needs more water broth also.  Mine became very dry. Used 4 chicken bouillion cubes and 5 cups water and was still too dry. Didn't use can of broth however.  Made without the tomatoes and pepper and instead added frozen peas, personal preference.  The dumplings were absolutely delicious though.  Very very very satisfying. Don't think the left overs will last very long.

AWESOME! In the past, my husband has complained that the chicken & dumplings were bland, but these were very flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly but to save time, I used canned bisquit dough. I will make this one again and again!

Fantastic!  Other than reversing the order of steps - I took out the chicken and separated the meat from the bones before I added the dumplings - it was wonderful.  Terrific comfort food.

This is a great recipe! We loved it!  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I am always heavy handed with spices and so I increased those quite a bit and next time will cook in a pot with a wider opening to accomodate more dumplings.

"pinch" is understatement. Be free with the spices, broth will be tasty!! I also (like so many before) omitted tomatoes and pepper. Left out the potatoes, too (too much!).  Added some white wine to initial liquids, as well as some flaked red pepper. I used bisquick mix for dumplings. Definitely a cold day meal keeper!

Turned out excellent. I omitted the peppers and tomatoes. For the dumplings I just used Bisquick mix and followed the directions on the box ;) . My oldest can't stand Chicken and Dumplings, but even she had some and said it was "pretty good". I'll be saving this recipe!

that was good. My husband and I couldn't stop eating. I didn't make the dumplings from the recipe as we don't get baking mix here in Bahrain. So I used another recipe from this same site. Even my kids wiped their plates cleaned. Shall be using this again

I LOVED THIS RECIPE and so did my entire family, including my picky 3-yr-old.  Although, I didn't include the tomatoes and peppers - I have made it several times.  The only sad part; hardly any leftovers!

When the temperature is in the single digits, there's nothing more comforting and satisfying than this nice thick soup. I sauteed my vegies and then sprinkled some flour into the mixture before adding it to the soup, which helped to thicken. I eliminated the green peppers and the tomatoes and just used Bisquick to make my dumplings. This was wonderful Michelle and we thank you!

It smelled great while cooking.  I made it for a large gathering and got many comments on how good it was. I did omit the peppers, but I don't think they were missed.  I will definitely make again.

Like the others, I switched the #2 and #3 on the directions, and I added some Crazy Janes Salt after serving.  Boyfriend had 3 helpings and wanted more but was so full.  Easy and tasty!!!

Tasted great but lacking liquid.  I tried it again with twice the liquid and it came out much better.  I also used biscuit dough from scratch instead of baking mix.

My family loved this recipe.  Wish I had read the reviews before making it.  I could have saved myself some time/work.  I, too, will take off all meat from chicken first before adding dumplings.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe looks great when it is done.  I made it without tomato and green pepper.  I also changed the order of things and took out the chicken, made the dumplings, and put back the chicken pieces.  This recipe cured my cold but it wasn't flavorful enough for what I was looking for.

I have always had a hard time making drop dumplings...but these turned out good...even in my slowcooker pot. Would also work well as a baked topping for a version of chicken pot pie.
