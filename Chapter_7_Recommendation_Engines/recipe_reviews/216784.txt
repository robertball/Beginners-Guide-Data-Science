Don't shy away from cardamom!!!! it's your friend. Not many people know its in the ginger family, it's strong! and earthy, and slightly citrus in taste. That 1/2 tea. really make these pop! Make sure you butter and eggs are at room temperature. Forgot to take them out of the fridge? Just pop them on top of a pre-heating oven for 30 min. 

Active dry yeast works just great if you don't have cake yeast. Made this spur of the moment when I just wanted to bake something quick and easy. 
Also: I will always substitute a light brown sugar for white granulated sugar in regards to dough . But thats just me.

Very good, fast and easy recipe. Substituted 2 packages of dry yeast instead of cake yeast. Definitely will make this recipe again. Did not use cardamom, as I did not have any. Added sugar glaze when the rolls were cool. Next time will try spreading on the butter and sprinkle on the sugar and cinnamon.

Instead of making rolls for this recipe, I decided to save a little time by rolling out the dough, adding the filling inside, and then braiding the bread by cutting the sides of the dough a third of the way in on each side and alternately folding each side to the middle.  I also drizzled an orange glaze over the top of the bread after it was done baking: 2 Tbls 1/2 & 1/2, 2 Tbls orange juice, zest from 1 orange, and powdered sugar until desired consistency.  The result is a blend of cardamom and orange heaven and a beautifully browned loaf that is sure to impress.

Delicious! Turned out delightfully fluffy.  Creamed the liquid ingredients, including the butter, before adding flour. Used two packets of instant yeast in place of cake yeast (cake is near impossible to find)and let that sit for about 15 minutes before adding to liquid ingredients.  

End result was a tender, fluffy crumb and delicate flavor. Oh! Also I doubled the filling, worked great!

This recipe is a keeper. The cardamom is there but subtle; there's not an overwhelming sweetness but a great balance of sweet combined with the softness of the breading/dough. 

Using cake yeast is a bit expensive (first time I've purchased it) but well worth it; it makes the dough's texture distinct when biting into it. 

I've never bought a cinnamon roll/snail this good. Really.

I just baked these rolls and they are very nice.  They were easy to prepare and came out very light and fluffy. I followed the recipe exactly, except I lessen the cinnamon a bit.  I made a basic icing from warm milk and powered sugar.  Everyone here really enjoyed them with hot tea.

Mine didn't come out quite so pretty, since I had a bit of trouble layering the two sheets of dough. Perhaps next time I'll simply roll them each on their own to get prettier results. The taste was great! It was fun making them, and they made the kitchen smell divine. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Easy to make and yummy! I just rolled the dough thinly into one big rectangle and cut it into 16 slices.  I baked them as pull-aparts in 2 round cake pans and turned the oven down to 400 so they didn't brown too fast. Drizzled some frosting on while still warm and they were delish!!

This is my first time baking cinnamon rolls and these are absolutely AMAZING!  Loved the cardamom too!  I made the dough in my bread machine and then rolled out into a single rectangle..and used brown sugar in the filling...baked in a cake pan and followed the directions for lowering temp..and then baked 8 min longer.  Topped with an orange glaze with zest, juice and 10xsugar.
Yummmmmm!!!

The coffee shop in my town sells cinnamon rolls with cardamom, and I am obsessed!  My grandma has made cardamom cookies at Christmas my whole life, and I love that flavor.  I wanted to try these for so long, and they are amazing.  Next time I will double the filling and bake them in round pans instead of on cookie sheets so they don't flatten out too much and all the gooey yumminess stays in the pan.  I drizzled a glaze of orange juice and powdered sugar over the top.  Delicious.  My daughter had fun using a thread to cut the rolls.  These are definitely going to be one of our house specialties.  I used just one package of regular yeast and they turned out fine.

I couldn't find cake yeast so I subbed with 2 1/4 tsp of dry active yeast and used fresh made butter because I ran out. Next time I will keep a better eye when baking. They turned out a little more brown than golden. Topped some with Orange Icing (2T milk, 2T OJ, zest of 1 orange, and powdered sugar) as another reviewer recommended. Great taste and the cardamom was a nice twist. Will probably use this more often since the rising times are not as long and the snails puff just fine.

I loved the simplicity of these rolls. I added 1/4 tsp ground clove and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and orange essence dried cranberries to the filling. When the rolls were baked I made a simple milk and powdered sugar glaze to drizzle over the tops. YUM!

I just made these and I should have doubled the filling. Next time I will for sure. I also made the orange glaze that other reviewers were mentioning. I messed up my dough at first because it wasn't rising so I put it on a double boiler, that was a big mistake. I managed to save half of the dough the rest of it cooked onto the bowl! Learn from my mistake, be patient. Great recipe.

Very easy to make and so yummy, I think next time I'll double the filling and spread the butter and sprinkle the cinnamon and use brown sugar, just a personal preference. Thanks for sharing!

P.S. Reviewer VM said yeast was not listed in the ingredients, if she looks again it's the second item listed.

They turned out great! I didn't have Cardamom on hand so I did half cinnamon and half nutmeg.  Next time I make them, I will probably roll them a little bit thinner in order to get more of a swirl.  I also made a quick vanilla glaze with powdered sugar, vanilla, milk and butter to drizzle on top.

I thought it would taste like a typical cinnamon roll but it wasn't very sweet and didn't have much cinnamon flavor either.  The bread also was a little dense although I did like the cardamom.  I thought something with 2 sticks of butter in it would taste a little richer...

Went out and got cardamom just for this recipe. I used dry yeast and followed the recipe as written. When making the “snail” I twisted the dough a little just for fun.  They turned out very pretty and were delicious.

are you selling the pictured products or making a recipe. no choice in the kind of yeast. The recipe in itself was so distracting that I would not bother to even try this. make it easy and simple and get the silly pictures out of the products. what other yeast can be used. dont have your kind or even seen it in market. sorry and the cardamon.............come on.

Cinnamon snails doesn't sound very appetizing to the taste of some people, but everyone, YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THESE CINNAMON ROLLS! I know this isn't the best review that you've ever read, but y'know what they say. PEOPLE THAT SOUND CRAZY ARE ALWAYS THE WISEST. Actually, you probably haven't heard this saying before, and that's because I made it up.  But back to the point. These are ONE HUGE THUMBS UP! peace off.

I've also increased the filling and used the 2 packages of dried yeast, the results were great!  The family loved them and asked for the recipe.   Comments about this recipe being easy were correct.  I'm planning on making this again especially during the holidays.

Since I didn't have cardamom I used vanilla
and almond extract, along with a bit more sugar and salt.  As someone suggested, I also used 2 packets of active dry yeast.  I made this in my mixer and switched to the dough hook for the final kneading.  I made one and a half recipes if filling -- they have lots of flavor!  I made an icing with  10x sugar, butter, vanilla and milk.  They are light and absolutely yummy. I got 17 rolls -- I made them slightly thicker than suggested -- but they won't last long.

An excellent, easy recipe.  I made an icing to go along with it. Next time I think I'll let the rolls rise a bit longer before putting in the oven.

Excellent recipe! Family loved it. I’m very new to baking, and this was plenty easy for me to make.

Liked it, didn't love it. A dryer cinnamon roll, not  sticky and gooey like I imagined a cinnamon roll should be. Added a cream cheese, powdered sugar icing. Will try another cinnamon roll recipe next time. For all the work cinnamon rolls take I want it to be melt in your mouth delicious.

My baking class made 3 different cinnamon roll recipes today. Danish Cinnamon Snails was the most popular choice with our guests, followed by a basic sweet bread made into cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing, and a slightly over-baked  Clone of a Cinnabon.

My wife made it and they tasted good. The only thing was, I think she baked it too long and the rolls weren't that full or thick as the ones in the photo.

These turned out amazing! Read several reviews but decided to follow the recipe exactly. The only thing I would change, is to double the butter, cinnamon and sugar mixture. We like more cinnamon flavor, but some may not. Will add pecans and raisins next time and lite icing on top. Soooo good!

My family loved these and they were not too sweet like many recipes for cinnamon rolls.  The cardamom is a really great addition and they were easy to make.

It was fun to try a new cinnamon roll recipe, which is pretty much what this is.  At first, it seemed that the cinnamon was way too strong in the filling, but it was okay.  The dough was nice and moist.  I ended up adding approximately one additional cup of flour to the dough.  Used my Kitchen Aid mixer, which may be part of the reason for that.  Baked in a 9x13 pan.  (Cut them to make 12 rolls.)  Although I could have easily cut them smaller.  Yes, I will make these again.  Might just use my usual filling for cinnamon rolls next time.  May also add slightly more cardamom, as the taste was not noticeable.

Too much yeast, makes a dry dough. Too high of baking temperature. Very dry and too brown. Also need to have yeast measurements for dry yeast also because that is what most cooks use. Lower yeast and bake on 350' only for 18-20 minutes.

Don't get why vm gave it one star for not listing yeast.  This is a great recipe.  I made exactly as written and it works.  I may put  an extra teeny bit of salt next time and extra cardamom too because I didn't taste the cardamom.  Maybe my palate isn't sophisticated enough.  My yield was eleven rolls.  Very easy.

There was far too much cinnamon, I couldn't even taste the cardamom.  Although it was very fluffy, I would maybe just use the dough recipe on its own to make some nice breakfast rolls.
