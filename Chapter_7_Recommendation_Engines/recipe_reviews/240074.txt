I used this on fish and it was delicious! The only thing  I didn't add was the onion powder because I had none, yet it didn't do anything to the flavor. A keeper!

This flavorful rub went well on a rotisserie chicken. The lemon zest is a welcomed addition to the other spices.

I only made about 1/3 of this recipe, mixed with olive oil and rubbed on my fresh chickens - then smoked them for 4 hours. YUM! Everyone raved about the meat! This is my 2nd time using and I will continue.
