This is a great BASE recipe. I actually changed it bit b/c people said it was bland (I also live close to Korea so...)
#1 I used beef broth NOT chicken (has no flavor)
#2 I added fresh tomato and more garlic to get that nummy soup flavor
#3 I used a sweet Taiwan Style sausage to compliment the spicy of the Kimchi
These additions changed the flavor A LOT. I also added a bit more Gochujang and Korean pepper powder. 
And, lets be real, I used the noodles from Cup O Noodles.

It was alright.  Had to use some Dasida (MSG) to make it a bit better along with the chicken stock.
