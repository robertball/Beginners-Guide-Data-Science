I love this technique for cutting the tops and stuffing these spuds.  The Paprika on top gives these a nice colorful touch.  I had to leave the egg yolk out - due to allergy concerns - I just added a spoon of sour cream to help hold it all together.  Can be made ahead.  Very nice presentation.

These potatoes were very flavorful with the green onion mixed in.  I chose this recipe because I was out of sour cream and this recipe doesn't call for it.  And you don't miss it.  I did add a little garlic salt for extra flavor, and I used yellow cheddar as I did not have white.  I like that the section sliced off the top is used inside the shell.  No waste!  Will definitely make again.

This is easily "skinnied" down...omit the egg yolk (not certain why it's added and it would require temping the potato) and use fat free half and half, only a small amount of butter in the filling with chicken stock.  Unless the potatos are small, I will half them lengthwise and add the insides of an extra potato or 2.  I will then pipe the filling into each half and use a butter spray on top.  This results in a much better presentation and my guests are much happier with a smaller serving.

My family raved about these potatoes... definitely worth the extra effort for a special occasion.  I had no heavy cream on hand and had substituted about 1/3 c. of cream cheese (1/3 less fat version) and 2 Tbsp. of milk.

I've made these twice-baked spuds many times... both as written, and by tweaking the recipe to accommodate my family's individual tastes...  real bacon really jazzes 'em up!  My buddy and his wife will be joining us for Christmas dinner this year, and this recipe has been requested as a side dish for what I anticipate will be a spectacular dinner... (I'm also serving Chef John's Crispy Honey-Baked Ham, found on his blog at food wishes.com).  Simply put, Chef John has never once let me down, and I remain a HUGE fan of his.

YUM! These were so creamy for only using a fork to mix. I usually use a potato masher. I decided to spray the potatoes with Pam spray instead of using oil. I always use oil, can't say why I went with Pam. Came out perfect! And no greasy hands to wash. So simple and easy to put together. I love the flavor that the green onions give these potatoes. Oh so good and pretty. Sorry Chef John, but I am going to follow this recipe exactly, why mess with a great thing? But I might add bacon next time, bacon makes everything better! Thanks Chef John!

This was my first time making twice-baked potatoes, and they came out truly delicious. I remember in Chef John's video for this recipe that he said he hoped people would experiment and do their own take on the perfect twice-baked potato, so I did. :) My own version of this will be quite different from this, but first of all, I took his advice and chose very round potatoes for baking. I added sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, butter, and a little paprika, salt, and pepper. I feel like this is a base model for whatever kind of potatoes you want to have. It was fun to experiment. My husband and I scarfed these down with 57 Sauce. (I know, completely unlike this recipe, but I'm taking Chef John's advice and that's my excuse.) These looked really classy, too. Will make again and again! Thanks, Chef!

Great to make ahead.  You can also freeze them.  Any combination of cream, butter, and cheese works well to give the creamy taste and tang of cheese.  Hard to ruin this recipe.  Never any leftovers!

Unbelievably fantastic!  Followed the recipe exactly but for a minor substitution of 1/4 c. of sour cream + 1/4 c. of milk for the heavy cream. It's time consuming to make these, but so worth it when you have the time. They look gorgeous and would be great for a dinner party.

Excellent - however, following the video - DEFINITELY taste the filling mixture and tweak as needed.  I added some dijon mustard, some Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, cumin, the tiniest sprinkle of crushed red pepper, garlic, dill  and oregano.  I just kept playing until I got a bit of a "zing" and enough saltiness.  These were a HUGE hit with my wife and daughter.  My wife said it tasted like the stuffing in her Grandmothers perogies.  A bit of hassle, and a bit time consuming, but I went the "traditional" route and halved the potatoes, so I turned 6 whole potatoes into a dozen twice baked ones.  This is a definite keeper and will be used when we want to "class things up" a bit

This is so easy. I always thought twice baked potatoes looked nice, but I didn't know how easy they were to make. I wish I would have had some chives to go on top of these, that would have made them perfect! I'm keeping this recipe for sure. It is something I think you can tailor to suit multiple occasions and dishes.

These spuds are delicious!! For my version I left out the egg, but added crumbled bacon, some SOFTENED cream cheese, sour cream, milk, jalapeño cheese, and sautéed onions. YUM, YUM, YUM!!
  I made enough so each person could have 2, and I'm glad I did as my friends inhaled them!
 I still have friends that talk about these potatoes! :)

Loved these!  Yes, any twice baked potato recipe will be time consuming, but if you plan ahead they become very easy.  I did not have heavy cream so substituted cream cheese and 2T milk and they were the perfect consistency.  Great recipe to personalize, too.  When I was a child my dad always added Beau Monde spice seasoning to baked potatoes.  It adds a definite flavor in this recipe also.  I loved the idea of placing the top skins inside the potato.  Nothing is wasted.  Enjoyed these a lot.

Yum...yum...yum...  Only had two potatoes but followed the recipe as written with amounts indicated...other than substituting cheddar cheese for white cheddar (our grocery didn't carry it).  Since I had so much fillling, omitted putting the tops in the bottoms of the potatoes before stuffing them so I'd have more room to use all the stuffing.  Turned out awesome!!  Definitely a "keeper" recipe!!  Next time I may put cheese on top about 10 minutes before potatoes are cooked (based on another reviewer's suggestion), but that's only because my husband and I are big cheese fans :-). Thanks for posting!!

Delicious and surprisingly easy! I did omit the egg yolk (personally didn't see the need) and I used Almond Milk in place of the heavy cream to bring the fat and calorie count down. Neither were missed. These were absolutely heavenly and my family loved them!

EXCELLENT!  Followed exactly.  Perfect!  I never change Chef John's recipes because they are always great.  To 'make it my own' (as he instructed) I only added 4 oz. of Chive & Onion Cream Cheese Spread to the hot mashed potato pulp before spooning into the shells.  Nothing else,  just the recipe Chef John shows.  This is a REALLY great take on 2x baked spuds.  Highly recommend it and I'm a chef.

this is one of my favourite ways to eat a baked potato   don'thave meat when I have this either just a salad as cheese is a protein but don't use heavy cream  too rich just skim milk and taste fine.

Very Beautiful, Festive and Yummmy. I added Peccorino Romano and Parmesan Cheese instead of Cheddar and some Garlic Chives It was a hit.

Thank you Chef John

I think I finally found the secret of this potato.  When I was a child we ate at restaurants where my father knew the chef.  Chef Johnny created the "Johnny potato" and he was my father's favorite chef.  I could eat those potatoes all day.  I still remember how good they were.  People using low fat are possibly not aware of the problems of low fat foods.  BTW, egg yolks have most of the vitamins and flavor of the egg. Cholesterol is hereditary according to my doctor and since mine is fine,  I have whole eggs everyday.

Love the potatoes but why would anyone put the cut off tops in the shell? Then where would you get the nice shaped potatoe skins for later on - filled with bacon and onions and cheese? Ooh! I gotta get cookin!

Fun recipe to make and worked out perfectly.  For some reason my shells ripped as I scooped out the potatoes, probably because they were still too hot.  Once I stuffed them you couldn't even tell.  Everyone loved them.  I used onion in place of green onion.

Made these last night and it was a hit!!!  Prepping took a bit of time, but it was worth it.  Spuds looked beautiful and tasted every bit as good as they looked.  I've tried others recipes before but decided to try this one (because John said "enjoy").  Chef John is the bomb!

I adjusted this recipe just a little.  I decided to use regular diced yellow onion I hate buying special onions just for one recipe. I added bacon to the potato mixture and added a mixed blend of white and yellow cheddar. After I fried the bacon I drained off the grease and put in the diced yellow onion in the same pan just to soften them (maybe 5 min). I used the entire pint of heavy cream, fresh ground pepper and salt. Added a few dashes of the cayenne pepper and three tablespoons of butter. I added some more bacon to the top of potatoes then brushed with melted butter. These twice baked potatoes are worth the work.

Second time making these - first for Father's Day and tonight for a nothing special day cause that's how great these potatoes are!  I did skip the egg yolk last time but may throw it in today.  No green onions on hand but have some chives which will work fine.  Great great recipe - love Chef John and not his first recipe have tried and loved also.

Followed this recipe with just a few modifications to taste.  Omitted onions and pepper as family member not tolerate.  Otherwise, very tasty and pretty to serve!!

Thank You!

This is the perfect base recipe! Omitted egg yolk. Subbed Gk yogurt for cream. Added a little garlic powder. Freezes well. I've also used sweet potatoes/yams. I've added to the filling/stuffing or used as various toppings: cooked, crumpled bacon; chives, green onions, salsa. Also, can be turned from side dish into an entree very easily.

This was great. I've made twice baked potatoes before and I'm throwing out that old recipe for this one. It had much more flavor (the amount of butter probably helped) and I liked the cayenne and paprika. I added ground beef in mine to make it a main dish. I didn't have any heavy cream on hand (who does?) so I subbed whole milk and melted butter (it says online that can be a substitute). It turned out great. I also sprinkled cheese on top before I threw it in a second time.

Dipped it in some barbecue sauce and it was amazing (although it's fine without the sauce, too).

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars it because of the time it took. But definitely worth it.

Didn't have green onions, used cheddar cheese, skipped the egg yolk and used sour cream because that was what I had. Still turned out light and fluffy and delicious!

These potatoes were fantastic. I found russets to be a bit small and used the jumbo potatoes (easier to cut and stuff). keeping them in for 15 minutes longer produced creamy potatoes. I like the stuffing to be a bit cheesier though so will probably add more to recipe, and added fresh chives.

I love chef John! I added fresh chopped  bacon and a tbsp of bacon grease to the potato mix for a SAVORY kick. I separated into two parts and added two tsp dry ranch seasoning to one, one tsp organic cayenne to the second making a variety for the coworkers. BIG HIT!

Perfect... this is exactly what I wanted to make.  I appreciate the video as well, since it showed the forking/mixing, instead of another recipe mixing with a mixer which caused the potato to not be as flaky/crunchy on top..

Thanks Chef John!

I used what I had on hand (milk, instead of cream. mozzarella instead of white cheddar). I also added garlic powder.
 Like someone said, this recipe would be hard to mess up. You can alter it to your liking, and it will still be great.

I spiced it up a bit with pepper jack cheese. This is a great recipe that can be modified in many ways. I would skip adding the skin to the bottom of the potato. Just leave enough potato in so you dont puncture. Even if its punctured its no big deal. It will end up just as fabulous. If you are going to freeze them.... freeze before the final cooking step.  I made a batch with and without the egg. There is a noticeable difference but they were both good.... the egg was better....IMO

I don't bake my potatoes for an hour. I throw them in the microwave for about 5 to 8 minutes depending on size and quantity. The difference is not noticeable.

Best potatoes I've ever had!!! I didn't make any changes at all because none are needed. I make these for special dinners like anniversary or birthdays  as well as dinner partiesometime or if I'm feeling ambitious lol. It takes a while and is a bit of work but WORTH it every time!!! Thank you chef John for sharing this with us

I left the paprika and cayenne out, added a little more onion, added sour cream and used medium cheddar instead of white cheddar.  Excellent recipe.

This is my first time making twice-baked potatoes and I turned to Chef John to help me!  I followed the recipe, except used the sour cream/milk instead of cream and I missed the step to put fork marks in the top to make them look pretty!  These were good and looked nice - I think I'd play with the mix a little to give it more flavor - add some more seasonings and bacon would be awesome!  Great starter recipe, I will definitely make again and play with the potato mix next time.

These potatoes are delicious.  They were creamy and so delicious.  Love the idea of putting the potato top inside the potato—how clever.  My husband loved them .. I used a bit of bacon and finely diced onion (I didn’t have scallions).  Also added some fresh chives.  Next time I will use scallions). Chef John never disappoints.  Thank Chef John.

My family loved these. I had fun making them - much easier than I expected. The over-stuffed presentation is awesome. 

I took a short cut by microwaving all 4 potatoes together for 2.5 mins on each side (5 mins total, full power). Then I added the veg oil coating and baked for only 30 mins - perfect consistency! 

It takes a ton of salt to make these yummy, but that is no different from most other potato recipes. Thanks Chef John!

This was an easy recipe to make.  All the necessary ingredients  were on hand.  It was delicious.  Next time I will use some really big potatoes because we all wished we had more.  You just need to remember to start early enough for it to be ready for dinner.

I mixed in bacon, cheese, and some leftover ham. Then I served them with the options of topping with roadhouse chili and/or sour cream.  It turned out great and everyone ate them up.

These were the bomb.  I followed the suggestion of making it my own recipe, so added carmelized onions, and smoked gouda along with the chopped green onions.  Forgot the egg yolk and frankly didn't miss it.  Potatoes puffed up and were moist and fluffy inside.  Frankly, one of the best potatoes I have ever made.

This was my first time making twice-baked potatoes and oh boy, I'll be making them again. Chef John's technique is PERFECT. Being that I didn't want to disappoint, I did not follow his recipe exactly, though I stayed fairly close.
I used paprika, cayenne, onion powder, (instead of minced onion) half and half, (instead of heavy cream) and salt and pepper to taste. Since I was only cooking for me and my husband, I split one egg yolk between two potatoes instead of four, and gosh golly Miss Molly did that make them velvety smooth. 
They were delicious, I'm definitely making these again!

Another winner. 
My daughter told me she likes her new “cooking” dad and so do I. 
I failed to boil the potatoes long enough so there were bits of hard pieces but we liked the added texture. 
Also scooping out cooked potatoes is an acquired art but I ate the marred ones!
Chef John is my bud!!!

Did not use egg yolk and added more cheese to the inside after a layer of the mashed part-then more mashed on top.  My Mom and I used to make these a lot when I was growing up.  We'd scrub a bag of russets and then bake them all at once. Once baked we'd mix them all up and make a slew of twice baked. Placed them on cookie sheets in the freezer. Once frozen we'd bag them up or put in containers to keep them sealed tight.  Just pull out however many you need for your meal -keeping the rest sealed up tight. Baked them in the oven to serve with any meal that you wanted to use them for.  It was so handy and an easy afternoon of cooking with Mom.

So good! The family asked for more! Yikes! It's rare that my husband, 6 year old and 2 year old are so pleased with the same meal. Followed recipe almost exactly (left out the egg). Only slight problem I had was that with double baking, the bottom of the potato became quite tough; otherwise it would have been perfect!

Like many, I skipped the egg and substituted cream cheese and milk for the heavy cream. I also added crispy bacon bits and sliced the potatoes in half the double the number of servings. My family loved it!  Can wait to see if they're just as good left over. Thanks Chef!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful! We had a guest over for dinner and we all agreed that the potatoes were the best!!! Next time I will freeze them after first go- not sure how long to heat? 400 for 30 minutes?

Excellent!  They were creamy on the inside with a nice crisp top.  I used half the amount of heavy cream because I added sour cream.  Next time I'm going to try it with small red potatoes for a family gathering.  Thanks Chef John.

They were a big hit and I have already been asked to make them again!.  When Chef John says to put the small piece of potato skin inside the  larger piece to make it seem fuller, it really does make it fill up.  You really have to be careful not to damage the potato skin or when you fill it and rebake it, some will make its way out.  A delicious recipe that make a great presentation.

Wonderful recipe! I will make it again. I used sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, heavy cream, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and a egg yolk to make the potato stuffings.   Made them ahead of time and refrigerated them,then warmed them up to serve with Chef John's prime rib recipe.  All was a big hit for Christmas Dinner!  I will be making them again.

Made these potatoes twice this weekend.  Ran out of white cheddar so I used yellow.  Wish I had gone to the store. The white cheddar looks better.

SO delicious!  I added bits of cooked bacon, but other than that it was perfect....made it at the fire station for the crews, every single person commented with the food still in their mouths that they've never had a better twice baked potato.  Chef John's recipes are consistently delicious and easy to make

These were fantastic. Spray the potatoes with Pam instead of drizzling them with oil.  I used 2% milk instead of cream and orange cheddar instead of white. I didn't have any cayenne. Our first time having Mrs. Wang over and she was impressed!

I think rubbing the potatoes with olive oil and course sea salt would have been a  better option than vegetable oil. The filling was lacking oomph, but the addition of sour cream took care of that. Bacon pieces and melted cheddar on top would make this a 5 star recipe.

Easy to follow recipe alongside the video. I liked that the tops are not wasted. We omitted the egg from the mashed potatoes because we don't normally use it. As Chef John states in the video you can make the mashed potato mixture using your own recipe. The technique results in a delicious baked potato and presentation.

This version of twice-baked potatoes were really delicious. I was really curious about omitting sour cream and using egg yolk and cream instead, and I have to say that I loved it! I added some chopped broccoli and bacon for a little extra something. It was so creamy and flavorful. This is a great make-ahead dish too. I made mine in the morning and served later that night. They were perfect!

I don't have a potato masher or a mixer, so I mashed the old fashioned way with a fork!  I also had limited ingredients and improvised with cooking cream and emmental cheese!  I forgot the egg yolk.  The most helpful part was taking the top part of the potato that was removed and lining the bottom of the potato with it before adding the mashed potatoe mix back in to bake for a second time!  I will for sure make these again!  There is so much room to be creative with when making these!!

Served these for guests and everyone loved them.  The presentation is fantastic, especially with the butter and paprika on top.  Very fancy-looking without being very hard.  I love recipes that are great as written but encourage experimentation.  Definitely a keeper!

These are absolutely the best twice baked potatoes!  As Chef John says, you don't have to follow the recipe completely.  When I remove the cooked potato from the skins, I mix the same ingredients as when I make mashed potatoes and add shredded three cheddar cheese to it.  Be sure to add the melted butter and paprika on top before baking the second time - it's what makes it so nice and crusty!

Always a big hit at neighborhood parties.  The candied jalapeños are unexpected twist but fan fave.

Very good taste. Consistency was a little too thin for me. They seeped out of the potato skin while baking down the sides to the pan. I will still make them again because they tasted good.
