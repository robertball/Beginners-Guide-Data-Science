A solid layer dip - I didn't use Miracle Whip though (we don't buy that) I used mayonnaise. Actually I could have left the mayo out and it wouldn't have mattered. I used red and yellow peppers because we like those and usually have them on hand. This is one of those 'Throw it together fast" dips that is very flexible depending on what you have on hand.
