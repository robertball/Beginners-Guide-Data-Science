I agree with the former review - I doubled the amount for the "tulip" cookie.  I like them a little thicker than they would be with the recommended amount. 

Otherwise, the presentation is great and the taste is wonderful. This could be used for any fruit that is preferred. 

To make the "tulip", I used ramekins and I had a very small pyrex dish that worked as well - in fact, it did the best. I had one of those and 4 ramekins... it's most effective to use those. Also, cook 2-3 at a time. It takes some time to get them off the cookie tray and into the mold for an optimal shape.

I rated this a 4 because of some concerns with the recipe.  I wasn't sure how much to beat the eggs.  I actually beat them just as I would for an omelet.  Also, the only cookie I had that held it's shape was one I "over cooked" just a bit - not burned but a little brown all over.  I only got about 7 "tulips" but they were delicious.  We just slapped on some of the filling and dug in.  The taste was fabulous and the presentation was beautiful for the one cookie that worked for us.

The flavor was excellent, kind of had the texture of a fortune cookie. I got the shapes to stick and it was easier to form them than I thought when making 2-3 at a time. However, they were pretty chewy, so I'm trying to figure out where I went wrong - since the photos look rather crispy.

These, unfortunately, were a miss for me. They were too chewy and if you live in a humid climate (FL, May-Oct) then they will not set. Mine were sticky and pliable. I had to toss them out as they were completely unusable. I did break a piece off prior to tossing and wasn't a big fan of the flavor. The butter was a bit too bold for my liking. The recipe says it yields a dozen, but I was only able to make seven after measuring the batter exactly as it's called for. I opted to make the cups without the filling as I was going to fill with homemade ice-cream, so I can't comment on how the strawberry concoction turned out!

Very easy and got rave reviews from the guests. Cookie stays just soft enough that it doesn't crumble. I used only 1 tbsp of batter and made about a 4 inch circle.  I baked about 6 at a time and molded them over mini muffin tins. By the time the next batch was cooked I was able to remove them. This made a nice hand held dessert. 

I made two batches. For the second I omitted vanilla and added 1 tbsp Kahlua.  These I topped with with a drizzle of chocolate syrup, yum!
Also I used real whipping cream-1 1/2 cups whipped is the correct substitute for the cool whip.
Update:
I have made these 3 times now.  Love them.  Once I use blueberries and pushed the plup through a seive.  They were great as well.

I tried 3 times to make the tulips. They look nothing like the picture. The texture was not right, too soft, need to be lighter, crispier. I think maybe there is a misprint in the ingredient ratios.  Plus how beaten should the egg whites be and there is no way you would get 12 servings with these measurements. I LOVE THE IDEA.
