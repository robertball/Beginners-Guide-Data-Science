7.25.16   Scaled to 6 servings,  this was done and easily shreddable in 7 hours, not 20-24.  Other than the unnecessary cooking time even for 12 servings, nothing to complain about here, it was simply nice to make pulled pork without BBQ sauce.  I can see many applications other than a pulled pork sandwich for this recipe, and will be trying a few with the leftovers.  I served this today as a sandwich with Asian cole slow, and it was delicious.  This recipe does have a lot of ingredients, but none overpower the pork.  Ingredient flavors are subtle, and you’ll taste many layers of flavor.  This is a good recipe for those who want to “step outside the box” for pulled pork.  Katherine Dyer, thanks for an outstanding new recipe.

I really enjoyed the sweet flavors on this pork!  However, the cooking time was way too long - this would be perfect with just half the time suggested.  I left it on warm for the second 10 hour period and it was still tough and overcooked at the end.  With the time modification, this would be a great recipe!

I made several modifications partly because of my own preferences and because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used fresh squeezed oranges and lemons in equal parts. I cut the amount of honey in half, I don't like meat too sweet. I substituted Chinese 5 spice since it contains most of the spices listed here. I omitted the balsamic vinegar, didn't seem Asian to me.  I added garlic-chili sauce (found in Asian markets) and Sriacha hot sauce to compliment the sweetness. When I ran out of soy sauce I  combined it with ponzu sauce. (A lime flavored soy sauce you can also find at Asian markets.) I added about three teaspoons each of fresh grated ginger and chopped garlic. (I don't really measure) I quartered a brown onion and lined the bottom of my slow cooker with the pieces. The pork came out so tender and flavorful, the house smelled wonderful! I plan to make some ramen soup and fried rice with the leftovers.

Made no changes to the marinade and absolutely LOVED this recipe! The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of the preposterous amount of cooking time stated. You don't need to cook it for 24 hours. If you do, you should probably look into getting a new slow cooker, because yours isn't working properly! The marinade itself, however, definitely rates 5 stars. If you like your meats sweet and savory, you'll probably like this. I think this has earned a permanent place in our rotation.

Definitely doesn't need 20 hours to cook. Mine was done in 9. It's very flavorful and super tender. Will definitely make again sometime.

We left out the brown sugar to cut some calories and it was still amazing. A really fantastic alternative to all the barbecue pulled pork recipes on AR!!
