These are OK. Not as spicy as I hoped, even though I doubled the mustard powder and added candied ginger I had on hand. Also,  I thought there was no reason to make them "giant" so I made them normal sized cookies...started with about 1" sized balls of dough which I flattened and sugared. These cookies really spread out when baking and made really thin cookies...thin, and kind of ugly. Maybe if I had made them giant they would have worked better, but I doubt it. They are good, but I would not make this recipe again. Also, I missed the usual cinnamon which can be spicy itself. So far favorite from this site is Grandma's Ginger Snaps.
