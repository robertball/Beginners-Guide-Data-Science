I will def make this again! Flavor is great. The chick peas(garbanzo beans) were a little crunchy, so I think I will cook them separately next time before adding to the dish.

This was a great recipe and I loved this Indian dish. Changes I made: Because I didn't have any spinach on hand, I substituted about 1 cup of peas. Throwing a handful of raisins in was a wonderful additional to the taste. Don't skip the Garam Marsala spice, which is a must! I found I needed to cook the mixture for an extra 15 minutes to get the chickpeas extra soft. Cook it long enough for this to occur, or the outcome won't be as good. I served this atop Basmati rice and made some homemade Naan. 

My mom, who isn't a big Indian food fan, really liked this as well. We got three nights out of the meal between two people including the rice and bread. I'll definitely make this again!

It was easy to make and a hearty vegan meal. I followed the recipe although I added more garlic and spinach because I had it to use up. I did toast my spices a bit by shoving the onion to the side of the pan then added the spices. I served it with rice and I added some sour cream to my bowl (I’m not a vegan).

Delicious! I didn’t have turmeric so I used curry powder. Doubled the spinach and it turned out great! Super easy and just the right amount of spice.

Great dish for a cold evening. Diced the sweet potato into small chunks. I chose not to add the spinach as I don’t like leftovers with leaves. Paired with basmati rice and fresh warm bread rolls. Delicious.

This is so delicious and flavorful! I left out the red pepper flakes and added chopped red, yellow and orange sweet peppers because I'm feeding a three year old.  We loved it and will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe. And so easy. Thank you. I think you can use this for any vegetable combination. The combination of spices is perfect for my taste.
