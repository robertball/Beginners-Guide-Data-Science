Great flavor! Piccata anything is always a favorite of mine, but I can't say I'd ever had tofu piccata. I'm glad I tried this! I forgot to plan ahead, so I ended up boiling the tofu instead of freezing. The recipe notes didn't say for how long, so I went with 15 mins at a light simmer. I'd recommend marinating the tofu in the artichoke/caper liquid ahead of time for more flavor. Also, once I added the tofu back in the pan, the breading began falling off, so next time I'll just set the tofu aside, make the sauce, then pour the sauce over top of the tofu.   The sauce also didn't take 10 mins to thicken/reduce down, more like 3-4. I'll be making this again!

We  liked it very much.  I doubled all wet ingredients so I’d have more sauce, and served it over angel hair.  Was terrified, but even better as a leftover the next day.  Next time I’ll make it a day ahead and reheat.

I used olives instead of capers, and seasoned breadcrumbs.  This is an awesome recipe!

There seemed to be too much artichoke as it was pretty sour. The tofu was delicious though. I won’t be making this again. I will try other tofu dishes.

Make sure you back off on the caper brine and artichokes.
