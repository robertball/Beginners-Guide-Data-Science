These are awesome!  I read all of the reviews and followed the advice.  I increased the marshmallows to 2 cups, used 6 Hershey bars, cut the graham crackers into smaller pieces, and only put the toppings on for the last five minutes of baking.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!

I made this for the 4th of July, and our guests couldn't devour them quick enough. I would maybe next time bake the brownie a little longer before topping it with the s'mores mixture, and cover it with foil to avoid too much darkening of graham crackers and marshmallows. I will definately bake it again in the future. It would be a great dessert to take to a potluck. It really goes further than you might think, given the fact that it's so rich.

I used the "best brownies" recipe on this site and baked them for 25 minutes, then I mixed up the chocolate frosting for that recipe and just mixed the marshmallows & teddy grams together and spread it onto the brownies right out of the oven....YUM!  It almost didn't need to go back into the oven, although I put it back in for 3 minutes.  The kids loved them!!  Thanks Liza!

I read many of the reviews and worked them into the recipe and the brownies turned out great!  I too used milk choc chips, teddy grahams, and extra marshmallows and baked plain brownie til almost done.  I then threw on toppings and baked 5 minutes - just long enough to melt the chips so they held everything together.  Thank you everyone for the tips.  I was very happy with the results and my daughter's class devoured them.

This is a great idea for you sweets lovers!! To make it not so rich, i always bake my borwnies on a cookie sheet  (15"x10"x3/4" or about that size) It makes the brownies thinner, then when you add the toppings, cute and serve, that are the perfect portion!! I also add about 2 TBS melted butter to the graham cracker mix, to keep it together a little better!!  YUM YUM!

WOW! These are so simple and easy to make, yet so incredibly delicious it'll have you asking yourself -Why didn't I think of this?  What a great twist on two classics - S'mores and Brownies! This was oh so chocolately, oohey gooey and just plain good!  I put the S'mores topping on the last ten minutes of cooking and it came out perfect.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I won't say I didn't like these, I just wasn't terribly impressed by the recipe. Take the advice of other reviewers and wait longer before adding the s'more topping, otherwise the marshmallows get too browned and the graham crackers develop a toasted/burnt flavor.  This is a fast recipe, and kids will probably love it.

I copied this recipe in 2001. I happened to check back on the reviews today and was amazed at all the trouble with this recipe. Everyone I make these for loves them. They disappear quite quickly. I use the cake recipe for the brownies and cook for 15 minutes. Then add the topping slightly pressing down, and bake another 15 minutes. If the marshmallows start to look too dark I shield them with foil for the rest of the cooking time. They are very good.

This was a HUGE hit at our family party!  Of course I saw the recipe but didn't have all the exact ingredients so I improvised and it turned out great!  I used milk chocolate morsels, 2 cups of marshmallows, and I didn't have graham crackers so I mixed 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs with 1/3 cup of butter and sprinkled some of that over the brownies then did the marshmallows and chocolate, then topped with the rest of the graham mix.  IT WAS AWESOME!  The buttery graham cracker mix really took it up a notch.  I'll be making this again!

I made this recipe with the S'mores Bars recipe from this site in mind. That recipe calls for the graham crackers on the bottom of the pan with the brownie mix over the top. I liked that idea combined with this one with them on the top since that's how s'mores are. I used eight graham crackers on the bottom, this makes the brownies take longer so I let them go their whole time then added the topping. For the topping I used 2C mini marshmallows combined with 1C Golden Grahams cereal (uniform shape is nice). After shaking this combination across the pan I placed the proportioned pieces (12/bar = 36 pieces) of three Hershey Bars evenly across the top of that (5 across, 7 down = 35 pieces, which leaves one for you to eat right away - enjoy!). I baked another 5 minutes and then broiled for 1 without a preheat. I let them cool completely and when I went to cut them into bars I kept the knife coated with cooking spray which kept the marshmallows from sticking to the knife, and that helped. Everyone raved about how good these were and that makes it worth the effort for me. Since, before the cutting, there's very little effort involved with these, so, so what if they take a little longer to cut. No, they're not as easy to cut as a plain brownie but they present so much nicer so it all evens out. I think as long as you know going in, they're going to take a little longer to cut it won't bother you when it comes time to do it.

Used Ghiradelli Brownie Mix - 2 bags for a 13 X 9 Batch. (Costco) It has chocolate chips in the mix. Baked per box directions for 45 min. Last 7 min. added the s'mores mixture. Used 2 heaping handfuls of mini marshmellos, a 10 oz bag of milk chocolate chips and 6 graham crackers that I put in a baggie to "smish". Topped Brownies in the last 7 minutes of baking and put back in the oven. Perfect! Teenagers rated it 5 stars and said; "So BOMB!" Looked like a cavity to me, but smells amazing!

These sounded fabulous. But even after following advice in other reviews about putting the toppings on later, they came out too rich. I used Teddy Grahams instead of graham crackers in 1" squares. Easy to cut... but rich! Ok, these are much better once you let them cool completely, not so sickeningly rich. =)

These are excellent! I was a little short on ingredients... 5 graham crackers, a little less than 1 1/2 cups of mini marshmallows and no milk chocolate candy bars. None of this was a problem. The amount of graham crackers and marshmallows worked fine and I only had 6 oz. of Baker's Semi Sweet Chocolate so I just chopped that into pieces. Everyone loved it. I followed the baking times and the first one was a little hard to cut and remove from the pan. Sprayed the knife with Pam and it was easy from there. These are really, really good! Thanks for sharing!

Good idea for a special brownie, I have done this in the past with different toppings.  If you can bake brownies no one should have a problem with this.  I bake the brownie as package directions. After baking turn off the oven sprinkle on toppings and put back in to melt.  I have used chocolate chips, mini marshmellows and peanuts for rocky road brownies, cant wait to find a occasion to try this version.

PERFECT. I used the "Best Brownies" recipe by Angie with this one. The last 10 minutes of baking, I put on the toppings. After it was done baking, I turned the oven off and left them in the warm oven for another 5 minutes or so. The chocolate and marshmallows melted perfectly! My family loved this dessert and I loved that it used up the leftover S'more ingredients from our last campfire before they went stale. Thank you for this fun recipe!!

These were a HUGE hit! I used milk chocolate chips in place of the candy bars(just so much cheaper). My brownie mix baked much faster tho(almost completely baked thru at 20 min).

These were very good but I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the brownie mix. I put the graham crackers into a ziplock bag and coursely crumbled them and I used 1C. of semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 C. of peanut butter chips for a lil extra zing since my kids are crazy about peanut butter! I followed other reviewers and added the toppings at the end of the baking .... about 5 minutes left of baking. WOW they were GREAT!!!

I made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe and I thought it was too chocolatey. The second time, I substituted the chocolate for Reese's peanut butter chips and oh, my it was delicious! I added the toppings the last five minutes of baking the brownies and it came out of the oven perfect. It tasted even better the day after baking!

Made these as directed except substituted 1 1/2 c peanut butter chips for the Hershey bars (did not have them on hand).  These were delicious!  Followed other reviewers advice and added the topping during the last 6 min of cooking.  Marshmallows were lightly browned and crackers were crisp.  Yummy!

Made the brownies with applesauce in place of the oil and used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate bars because I forgot the bars at the store. Baked for about 20 minutes and then baked an additional 10 minutes after adding the topping. Turned out great!

I love how quick and easy these are to make.  They definitely took care of the craving I had for s'mores.  They were a little on the sweet side for me, but I guess that is to be expected when you are adding sweets to sweets. :-)

Made a double batch for a co-worker's birthday and received compliments all day. I baked two pans of brownies (Duncan Hines Fudge - fudgy version, of course) for 25 minutes each. I split a third of a box of Honey Maid graham crackers, a bag of mini marshmallows and a bag of Hershey's semi-sweet morsels between the two pans. Added the toppings then baked an additional five minutes. I would definitely make these again.

Delicious!  I loved the crunch of the graham and toasted marshmallows, and the contrast with the ooey gooey brownies.  I did not cook quite as long as stated after adding the toppings.

Yummy....but a 4 because made this in an 8x8 and it took so long to cook and even though I added the S'mores topping close to the cooking end....the topping (especially the marshmallows) was still a little too dark for me....and kinda hard to cut once they cooled because of the marshmallow....not the recipes fault, tasty non the less...next time I will make in a 9x13 as stated in the recipe.... thanks!

HOLY DESSERT HEAVEN! I made these for Father's Day and won the permanent best wife award!

I don't know why so many people had issues with the recipe. I followed it exactly (except I used 6 chocolate bars, not 8) and it turned out scrumptious. Thank you for bestowing this brownie-turned-s'more recipe on me!

Made this with the Bombshell Brownie recipe from this site.  It was perfect!  I put the topping on with 15 minutes to go.

Tasty and easy to make, but thought the chocolate would melt the graham crackers and marshmallow to the brownie but that did not happen.  They were very difficult to eat when all the topping fall off.  If I make these again, I'll try adding the chocolate first to melt it, then spread it out and press graham crackers and marshmallows into the chocolate.

My daughter and I made this for a back-to-school potluck. They were super easy to make, and the first dessert to go.  We used an 11.5 ounce bag of milk chocolate chips, and the brownie mix we bought was not quite 21.5 ounce (can't remember the exact size, but the box did specify that it was for a 9x13 pan). They turned out fine. Buttering the sides of the baking dish is essential for getting them out of the pan once they've cooled/set.

Great recipe and it's super easy. Instead of putting the toppings on with 15 minutes left, I remove the Brownies when they are supposed to finish  on the box, and then add the crackers and marshmallows. I broil it for 30-60 seconds and then immediatley add the chocalate pieces. Mmmmm

I used chocolate chips to top my brownies instead of milk chocolate bars, but otherwise followed the directions.  These were really good, but the graham crackers got kind of soft after a while.

My husband loved these and started with dessert first for supper when I made these. So easy with a brownie mix.  The next time I may try using milk chocolate chips and bake brownies for 20 min. and only 10 minutes after adding topping. My marshmallows were toasty brown.  But hey, isn't that the way a s'more over a campfire is supposed to be.  Thanks for the recipe, Liz

The 5th grade class loved these!  I cut the graham crackers into smaller pieces; used chocolate morsels; cut the large marshmallows into smaller chunks and added two tsp. melted butter to the toppings.  Otherwise I followed the directions.  This recipie is a new staple for classroom parties.

Awesome!  I used two cups of marshmallows, crushed up the graham crackers really well and used a couple of handfuls of hershey's chocolate chips. I melted a half of stick of butter and poured it over the graham crackers and then added the marshmallows and chips and mixed it all together.  I baked the brownies for about 20 minutes and then added the mixture and baked for about ten minutes more.  They are a little bit messy if you try to cut them up before they cool but if you let them cool for a bit it's definitely easier.  They looked awesome and they tasted even better!!!

This was a hit at our football game party.  VERY RICH!  I suggest cutting them into 1" x 1" or 2" x 2" squares.  Also beware of the broiler.  I put this in and it took about 30 seconds to brown.  One of our kids said "this is Heaven!"

Easy and good.  Knowing that I was going to be taking this to work, I thought it would be easier to make into mini brownie cupcakes.  But, as I tried to add the toppings to the little cupcakes, I decided that I should have just stuck to making them in the pan.  I did have leftover batter, so I put it into a small pan and made those the way I was supposed to.  In the end, the cupcakes turned out fine, and everyone at work thought they were cute and delicious.

I couldn't get the graham crackers to stick to the brownie and the marshmallow must have caused the whole thing to just stick to the pan.  I won't make this again.

I make this recipe anytime I'm asked to bring a dessert to something (baby shower, church function, etc.) because its so easy, and they are always a huge hit.  The best part of this recipe is that it looks so much more gourmet than it really is.  No one has to know that its a brownie mix, and all the toppings make it appear very fancy.

Hi,
I submitted this recipe. When I made it recently, I realized that this really should be cooled overnight before cutting or it turns into a big blob. Frankly, I cannot understand the difficulty people have had with this recipe--it bewilders me!
Add the toppings in the last 10 minutes if you find they burn (and get an oven thermometer to make sure your oven is accurate). Break the graham crackers smaller for easier cutting. This is not rocket science people!!! (as Emeril would say!).

My favorite recipe of all-time is my Yummy Yam Casserole, also on this site. My friends beg me to make this recipe.

I guess it's just me, but I must not be able to bake brownies even out of the box. The flavor was great, but even after cooking it for 30 minutes (the box said 24-26 minutes), it STILL wasn't baked through. I had to put them back in the oven to cook for another 8-10 minutes. Definitely cut while they are warm (out of the oven is best) or else the toppings will gather on the edge of the knife and pull off the brownies. I think next time, I'll put the smores mixture directly into the brownies and bake them. I personally didn't take these to a party like I was planning, because they were still undercooked and it would be impossible to eat without the toppings falling off everywhere. Really wish I would've read the reviews beforehand.

I've used this a couple times to use up some brownie mixes and candy bars to make something that DH could take to work.  The first time I made it as is except I didn't add the graham crackers.  The marshmallows got crunchy (not appealing to me).  The second time I used a double batch of brownie mix and just the candy bars (5 regular sized 5th Avenue bars).  Both times they were a big hit.

This was a really super simple recipe, and so delicious! These brownies disappeared in a flash! I do recommend adding the marshmallows further into the cooking process so they don't brown. Like around 20-25 mins. I didn't the first time, and the marshmallows got a bit brown. It didn't look very appetizing, but boy, were they good!

These were fun, but VERY rich and chocolatey. They were very good when they were fresh out of the oven, but once they cooled the smores mixture got gummy and had a weird texture.

Fabulous!!!! I used crushed graham crackers 1 package and ½ stick of melted butter mix the two together and chocolate chips! Layered the chips, marshmallows, and crumbs! The next time I make this I will bake the brownies until they are done, and broil the topping to brown! The way I did it today the brownie fell and therefore tough! Very rich! I recommend small bites!

I am not sure if I spread the pan too thinly..but my brownies came out really crisp. My students loved them..I remade this recipe last night and used a brown pan and it turned out perfect. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead and topped the brownie off 8 minutes before the brownies were supposed to be done. My husband loved it!

I made my own brownies using the One Bowl Brownies recipe from this site, baked it for 15, topped it with the s'mores and baked for 10 more as directed...and it burnt =\.  It might've been due to my oven, but next time, I'm baking the brownie longer and putting it back in with the s'mores just until the marshmallows and chocolate spread/melt.  Easy peasy way to use up your leftover s'mores from summer camping!

Wow! These were a delicious treat. I used a 9x9 pan, 4 graham crackers, 1 c. mini marshmallows and 8 Hershey kisses chopped coarsely. They were perfect. I followed advice to add topping for the last five min. I also cut them while they were warm so the topping didn't pull off. The knife was messy, maybe I should have sprayed it with Pam first. I took half over to my neighbors, kept two for myself and froze the other two. I don't know how they froze, yet. Someone mentioned that they don't keep well (graham crackers stale). Maybe this will work out.

OMG these are the best frelling brownies I have ever eaten in my LIFE! They are amazing and perfect and chewy and rich and I'm going to need to buy some fat pants because I could eat the entire pan when I make these. I really wanted to try these out but the only marshmallows I had were the half bag of rock hard old ones I found in the back of my pantry. I used them anyways, and added all the topping during the last 5 minutes. The marshmallows really didn't blob everywhere and everything looked really pretty, although it didn't last long as we all devoured them like super gluttons. Ooo man these are way, WAY too good...

Ooey Gooey Greatness !!!  These are incredible.  All you have to do is listen to the other reviewers.  Break the crackers smaller than is indicated in the recipe and dont put the toppings on til the last 5 minutes of baking. I used half a bag of mini-marshmellows. This is quick and easy and the absolute YUMMIEST !!! Thank you Liza !!!

This was very good! I would make the "cake recipe" brownie next time I do this. My fudge like brownie was a bit too moist after I put all the 'smores toppings on the top.

Lesson learned... from now on I will read the reviews before trying a new recipe!!  I totally agree with what everyone said.  This recipe has tons of potential.  Less time with topping on, more marshmellows, smaller graham cracker pieces.  But I can't wait to try it again!!

I think this recipe has a lot of potential.  Next time I will increase the time to bake the brownie only.  I think next time I will break the graham crackers smaller than 1".  Overall, a VERY simple and good recipe

I loved this recipe, but made a few changes: Instead of using a packaged brownie mix, I used my own brownie-from-scratch recipe...and I added the topping after about 25 minutes of baking, so it went back in the oven for only about 10 minutes. This made the marshmallows puff up and turn crispy (but not melt into oblivion)...the chocolate pieces get soft but retain their shape. Delicious!

This was a little much for our family.  The sticky from the marshmellows is OK when camping, but if just added the choclate pieces from the candy bar's it would have been just as well.  It did taste good though...once.  Thanks Again

I only give this a two star. I was really disappointed this tastes NOTHING like smores. In fact I thought it was rather flat tasting. I would  not make these again.

I brought this to a bbq with my husband's Army officer buddies, and the guys couldn't gobble these down fast enough. I just eyeballed the amounts of crumbled Hershey's chocolate bars, mini marshmallows, and crushed graham crackers and mixed 2tbsp of melted butter in the mixture before putting it on the brownies. I put it on the brownies about 10 min before they were done and pressed it down slightly. Make sure they're ALL the way cooled before trying to cut them into squares, or you'll have a gooey mess.

Quite good. I did slightly over-bake my brownies, unfortunately. They were still good. I did a layer of chocolate covered graham cookies at the bottom of a square pan, mixed up the brownie mix (applesauce and soy milk instead of water and oil), added 1 cup of marshmallows directly to the batter then baked for 20 minutes. I then took it out to top with the rest of the chocolate covered graham cookies and marshmallows (skipped the chocolate bars since the cookies already had chocolate on them) and baked probably 15 minutes more. Do not exceed 8-10 minutes! The brownie itself wasn't fudge-y at this point, but the topping helped. It's best when warm and served with milk. In a word, these are quite rich. I may try some other variation using this recipe as a base.

Amazing!  Always a hit.  I've found you can adjust the amount of graham crackers, marshmallows and chocolate to fit your budget and the size of packages.  For example, I buy a six-pack of Hershey's bars and use three, so I can make two recipes with them.

This is an easy and very yummy way to fancy up plain brownie mix. I gave it 4 stars because the graham crackers burned a little. I recommend putting the graham crackers on the brownie first then the marshmallows and chocolate chips. I used large marshmallows also and it was SO pretty.

I know that some reviewers said that these brownies are too rich or too much, but if you have a sweet tooth as much as me, you will agree there is no such thing as too sweet. :) These brownies were really good! My entire family devoured these brownies in 5 min. flat. Thanks for a good recipe!

These were very good but also very messy.  I followed the advice and waited until the last five minutes to put the toppings on.  I think I should have put them on much earlier because they didn't cook into the brownies and ended up falling off.  Next time I make this, I would pour the brownie mix in, then put the chocolate chunks on, then the graham crackers.  When only five minutes remains for cooking, that's when I'd put on the marshmellows.

After reading all the reviews I decided to semi crush the graham crackers, use chocolate chips instead of chocolate bars and didn't put on top of the brownie until they were almost done, about 7-10 minutes for the marshmallow mixture.  It came out pretty good, but very rich.

My kids loved this!  I did make half of the recipe without marshmallows for the non-marshmallow lover, however you need them in order to hold the chocolate and grahams on the browniesl.  Yum!

I made these for a BBQ this week and everyone LOVED them. I ended up using a little more "toppings" (chocolate, graham crackers and marshmallows) than the recipe called for and they were great. Next time I might use even more marshmallow, since that seemed to be the best part. This is a keeper!

This recipe was disappointing and I'm not really sure why since it sounds so good.  The marshmallows puffed up nicely while baking but then fell flat as they cooled - you can hardly tell that there is marshmallow on it.  The chocolate didn't really melt a whole lot, it just kind of hardened.  I am going to try this recipe again and make a few modifications.  I may try the marshmallow cream instead and maybe grate the chocolate and use large graham cracker crumbs instead of the big pieces.  I won't bake the brownies with the topping on them as long either, maybe that's what happened to this batch.  Good idea for a recipe, I hope that I can make it work next time.  Thanks.

I made this for a summer picnic and was a big hit! I did as recommended, but waiting until the last 5 minutes of cooking of the brownies before adding the topping. I did add in chocolate chips into the brownies to make them extra chocolate taste!

These brownies were in the top 5 brownies I've ever had, and brownies are the one dessert I  won't pass up when it's around. They are terrifically easy to make and they turned out really moist and SO great tasting. I made them with the "best brownie" recipe, so the cooking time got a little messed up. I ended up baking them for 40 min, which I thought for sure would dry everything out. But it came out perfectly. I'll definitely be making this again!

I tried this recipe using other reviewers recommendations of 2 cups marshmallows and 6 Hershey's bars. I was really disappointed with the final result. I don't know what I did wrong but I will not be trying this recipe again.

I made these brownies to take to my son's soccer game for a treat. They all LOVED them and requested them again and again.  My daughter's boyfriend just brought one to his soccer practice as a snack and now his teammates want us to make some!  I guess these are very teenage boy friendly, so be sure to make extra!!

Yummy and very rich. Used 2 cups mini marshmallows, 8 oz. chocolate, and 1 1/2 cups honey Graham's cereal, and only added them for the last 7 minutes of baking.

I have made these for years and they are SOOOO good.  I learned to make them where you bake them until they are almost done, pull them out and sprinkle with chocolate chips and marshmallows and throw them back in just to melt the chocolate and make the marshmallows puffy and sticky.  when you pull them out cover the tops with whole graham crackers.  They are rich but they are yummy.

One of my friends quotes after eating this, "best dessert I've ever had". Only slight modifications I made were using a graham cracker pie crust instead of the actual crackers. Also, used milk choclate chips instead of the bars. Very easy and fantastic.

I found this too rich to finish my small piece, but my DH absolutely RAVED, so 5 stars it is. It may have been too rich because I used a Ghirardelli mix -- perhaps I should've used a plainer one. Thanks for sharing :)

It was a FANTASTIC recipe! I didn't have the right size pan on hand, so I used cupcake tins instead and baked for a total of 20 minutes instead. I also ran out of graham crackers, but used Maria cookies instead and it was still unbelievably delicious.

MAJOR success!

This was okay. I followed the directions completely and the marshmellows ended up cooking a little too long. They were too chewy and I could basically peel the graham cracker, marshmellows and chocolate shavings off of the brownie. But otherwise tasty!

These are really good, very addicting too! I should've read the reviews and cooked them longer before putting the toppings on and then covered it because everything on top really browned. The taste is really good, just like a S'more!

Full disclosure: I didn't measure out the toppings, I just mixed a proportion that looked right in a bowl before topping the brownies, so I had a pretty perfect blend of toppings. I didn't think these were too rich at all once they were done. Rich, yes, but not too rich. Maybe that's because I had less topping than the recipe calls for, I'm not sure. The main problem I had with this recipe is that it didn't keep for longer than 2 days--after 2 days the graham crackers got soft and stale.

This recipe was fun and easy for my 10 year old son to make. I had him use a 12oz bag of semi chocolate chips to make it easier for him. He loves to cook and this was something that he could do by himself with supervision.

These were great! I used 8-10 graham crackers though and 2 cups of marshmellows, since I was using an 13 by 9 inch pan. They definitely need time to cool. I would suggest baking them the night before you want to serve them, or place them in the fridge so they turn out more like bars. They were quite gooey and deliciously like a s'more. Everyone loved them, so I am definitely keeping this recipe in mind for group get togethers!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  It can be difficult to cut, so I recommend letting it cool for 12 hours or in the fridge after initial cool down to help.  I found that a pizza cutter worked the best for me.  They are rich and tasty, and I'm always asked for the recipe when I bring them somewhere.

As if s'mores aren't rich enough already, then you have to go and add brownies!  Oh boy!  These are very good.  Perfect for a summertime potluck - which is what I made them for.  I followed the baking directions, putting the topping on after 15 minutes, then baking another 15 minutes.  The marshmallows didn't get too brown at all!

Amazing and delicious! I made this as a double layer brownie cake and used chocolate frosting between the layers and all around the cake. I used 3 long skewers to keep the top brownie layer set and not to slide off the cake. I topped it with the mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, graham crackers and white chocolate chips. I melted some chocolate and mixed that into the left over frosting and drizzled it on top of the cake. I made it for my son's birthday and it was a big hit.

I followed the advice of several reviewers and only added the graham cracker/marshmallow/chocolate mix the last 7 mminutes or so, but the marshamallows and graham crackers didn't toast up very well. Also, very difficult to cut. The flavor wasn't everything I'd hoped for.

These brownies were good, but not as gooey as I'd hoped.  I incorporated some previous reviewers' suggestions and used milk chocolate chips, extra marshmallows, and added the topping during the last few minutes of baking.  The brownies looked great.  The marshmallows were lightly toasted, and the graham crackers did not burn or get dark.  However, I thought the marshmallows came out too hard and chewy.  Maybe I shouldn't have let them get lightly toasted.  If I make these again, I will try baking for even less time after adding the topping.

I was looking for a recipe to use up S'mores supplies.. and this fit the bill pretty well. I had large marshmellows that I just cut up to go on top, and just crumbled graham crackers and chocolate until it looked like enough. It was good. I'll definitely keep it in mind for the future, but I don't know if it will go in my permanent rotation.

These btownies were heavenly, except I hated messing with the marshmallows, they were kind of hard to manage when spreading over the brownies and when cutting the brownies. Otherwise these are definetly a keeper.

Always a hit wherever I take them, I have modified this recipe to be "low-fat".  This helps to cut back on the sweetness some as well.  Use a low-fat brownie mix instead of a regular mix.  Under cook by a few minutes before adding crumbled low-fat graham crackers and the mini marshmallows.  Bake for only a few minutes more to finish the brownie and melt the marshmallows a bit -DON'T overcook the low fat brownies will dry out.
Instead of chocolate pieces/chips/candy I drizzle chocolate syrup over the top after baking.  It is easier to cut warm.

I didn't have a box mix on hand so I made homemade brownies that were a little more cakey.  I think I would have liked the chewy, fudgy taste of a box mix better, but love the topping regardless. I used semi-sweet chips, mini-marshmallows and low-fat grahams.  I think next time I will cut down on the chocolate chips, and add more marshmallows because that is my favorite part, and they look so pretty toasted in the oven!

Everyone I served these to loved them, but I felt that some of the graham flavor was lost.  Next time, instead of using more of the base on top, I might just crumble graham crackers.

I had high expectations for these brownies and was a bit disappointed.  I made them for the 4th of July and packed them up to take to the fireworks display-- out of the 12 kids that tried them, 4 loved them and 8 didn't.  They weren't as "s'more-sey" as I hoped and awfully messy to eat.  I was glad the kids were outside!  Probably won't make these again.

it was okay, but kinda pointless. Good, but might as well make normal ones with chocolate chips. Plus the marshmallows looked kind of ugly.

Instead of the choc. bar I just used semi-sweet choc. chips.  I also left out the graham crackers from the mixture and just layed the out on top of the brownie after it came out of the oven.  Using a 9x13 pan, I fit 28 of the rectangular graham cracker pieces leaving a little room in between each piece.  After it cooled completely, I cut out the brownies according the graham cracker pieces and ended up with 28 "bars".

Should have paid attention to everyone else. Topping went on way too early and ended up burning. I will try again only next time put the topping on the last five mins of baking and also make a cake like brownie. Has lots of potential if you like to experiment.

I agree with other reviews. The idea sounds great but the toppings go on too soon and then almost burn. The graham crackers make it really hard to cut.  Smaller pieces would be better.  But, I'm not ready to give up on this recipe yet!

Great recipe Lisa !
Many friends  I have passed it on to love it as well.   I use chocolate morsels, Nestles or Hershey's and cinnamon grahams. I throw some toffee chips into the batter. It is gooey but oh so yummy.  No one can get enough.  Thanks.

I agree with Mary Jo Wikle. I was also disappointed in this recipes.  It sounds wonderful and perhaps I am doing something wrong,
but I had the same problems as to not enough marshmellows, candy did not melt, and the graham crackers in 1 inch pieces made it very difficult to cut.  Also, the cooking time after adding the toppings is too long.  Mine almost burned.  I will try this one more time with some adjustments.

I love s'mores.  And this is perfect for having a s'more dessert during the winter.  My wife said that it was very rich for her and that it should have less chocolate.  I took her chocolate-lover card away, and reminded her that there is no such thing as too much chocolate. :D

These were awesome!  Rich and chocolatey! Best on the second day.  I wanted a thicker brownie so I used an 8x8 pan and followed the baking time and temperature on the back of the box.  I did not have a Hershey’s chocolate bar so I used chocolate chips. Since I used a smaller pan, I just tossed a handful of marshmallows, chocolate chips, and graham crackers on top. These really need to cool completely before cutting or they fall apart.  Better the second day.  Easier to cut and more flavorful.

Made this dessert to take to a family gathering. It turned out perfect! Everyone loves S'mores! One thing I did different  is I cooked the brownies completely before adding the topping. I also put them under the broiler after adding the topping...so keep an eye out so it doesn't burn. Will definitely make them again!

Easy to make considering you use whatever brownie mix you want. I always use Ghirardelli brownie mix so the extra added chocolate and marshmallow made it super fudgey and gooey.   Great for work goodies.

Wow! Not only delicious, but easy to make!! I substituted Trader Joe’s graham crackers as it is covered in sugar and cinnamon, as well as used their chunky semi-sweet chocolates. I think it added  (especially the graham crackers) a new level of flavor.

These came out very good! Brought to a Halloween party and heard good comments. After it baked for about 15 min, I just randomly sprinkled the top with the ingredients (Instead of mixing together in a bowl). I used close to 2 cups of marshmallows as others mentioned. Just eyeballing the amounts, I used the small, ~2" wide Hershey bars. I broke those and the graham crackers into very small pieces. It just needed another 6-7 min to bake after that. This would be great for a bake sale at a church, etc. Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding - a winner with high school and college kids and … well, adults who are not bound by dietary restrictions.  I use more of everything in the topping chopping up crackers and bars fairly small.  I bake for 20 minutes, add toppings, bake 7 more minutes, broil for 1 minute or so.  WATCH IT the entire time the broiler is on - one second too long and memories of campfires with blackened marshmallows will be relived.

We added coconut oil to substitute for vegetable oil. We also added a few large marshmallows cut in half because we were running low on mini marshmallows. It was delicious! Rave reviews from our party guests.

Made these in non-stick parchment baking cups in muffin pans. Filled 1/4 full (1-2 TBS), added toppings last 10 minutes of baking time. Reheated to warm just before serving for a crowd. Everyone said they were one of the best desserts they ever had. Made 24.

My husband buys squares like this from a nearby bakery. They have been out the last few times he has stopped so I thought I would try making these. Delicious! I used a 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips, two cups of marshmallows and 6 rectangles of honey Grahams. Added toppings when 5 minutes were left on brownie cook time, then under broiler on low for one minute.

I added the marshmallows around the last 6 minutes or so just so they could get a tad browned. I ran out of graham crackers so I used GOYA Maria cookies and everyone loved it! Couldn’t tell the diff!

I keep forgetting how easy and delicious this is!  It's a keeper for sure.  A huge hit at work and never any leftovers to take home.  Mini Teddy Grahams are perfect for the cracker part of this recipe.  They are the perfect size, provide great flavor and texture, and always bring a smile to those eating them.   For the baking portion I followed other reviewers advice and cooked the brownies for 20 minutes prior to adding the s'more topping and then backed another 10 minutes to get everything melted and marshmallows toasted on top.

These were just ok. Probably fantastic to a s’mores lover. I’m not a big fan of them which, surely, is why they weren’t a big deal to me.  If you like s’mores and brownies you’ll like these.

Well,  I tried this twice. the first time, the brownies cooked too fast, and the topping didn't cook at all. The second time, I changed the bake time, but the brownies didn't bake, and when I spread the marshmallow mixture the marshmallows turned way to done and I didn't get any graham cracker taste. I'm an old Campfiire Girl who ate a lot of S'mores, and this just doesn't do it. My advice -- save the time and money. I had to throw it away.

I've made these many times and they are delicious but a huge pain to cut. I've found that if they cool completely and then I refridgerate them for a bit, it is much, much easier.

I also cook the brownies completely, quickly add the toppings and put it under the broiler on low for a minute or two until the marshmallows brown a bit.

5 stars because this is quick, easy and loved by all. Gourmet...not really, but easy enough for the kids to make and who doesn’t love chocolate, marshmallows,  graham crackers and more chocolate!! I had everything on hand, except the chocolate bars, but I did have a bag of milk chocolate chips. That was the only substitution I made. I questioned putting only one  box of Ghirardelli in a 9x13. (I usually make 1 box in an 8x8 pan) I was worried it would be too thin a batter to cook for 30 minutes @350 and not be over done, but they turned out perfect.  Based on other reviews we upped the marshmallows to 2 cups and broke the graham crackers up into pieces a little bit smaller than 1 inch pieces. I used about 1/2 of the bag of chocolate chips. , I cooked the brownies 20 min before adding the topping, then cooked an additional 10 minutes once we added the topping. They were perfect. The marshmallows were a light golden brown and the graham crackers were crispy, not burned. I tried to cut them when they were slightly warm, but that was too messy. Mine cut easily and looked better when I waited for them to cool completely. I served them at a party and they were the first dessert completely gone from the dessert table!

I made this with chocolate and butterscotch chips and the kids loved it.  They said it would have been better had I served it warm.

My children loved it. Made brownies from scratch from this site, after it was baked, I put the topping on (used dark chocolate chips) and merely broiled it for 5 minutes. So yummy, next time I'll add more marshmallows!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Easier version is to bake the brownies as directed on the package until done, remove from oven and sprinkle with 2 cups marshmallows, then graham crackers then top with chocolate pieces (I use 6 Hershey Bars broken up).   Pop the pan back in the oven under the broiler for about 30 seconds or until marshmallows are light brown.  Doesn't take long so watch closely so they don't burn.  Quick and easy!

Followed the directions exactly and I thought they were awful.  Maybe it was the box mix brownies, usually  make them from scratch.  They were not good to me.  Doubt if I'll try again though.  Very easy to make though.

I made it to the recipe. They were very good, except the chunks of graham crackers fall off.  I'm thinking maybe trying graham cracker crumbs next time?

the kids appreciated it a lot. I was not overly awed by this recipe, but I guess this is an adult problem. I used the MMM...brownies recipe from this site as I didn't want to use a cake from a box, and as it asks for some melted chocolate I only had bitter chocolate and decided to go along with it. It cuts a bit on the sweetness, which is good, considering. Same problem with the marshmallow mixture, I only had white chocolate, but everybody declared that is an improvement on the recipe.

My son and I really enjoyed this - we both love s'mores.  I used Bakers one bowl brownie recipe which I love.   I should have read the reviews first before trying this recipe.  I put the topping on  after 15 minutes and the marshmallows got too brown  but it was still delicious.  Next time I'll put it on in the last 5 minutes.  Great recipe.  Bound to be a crowd pleaser.

Well I do not use box mixes, so I simply subbed a good homemade brownie recipe.  took the advice of others and waited until they were almost done to ad the s'more mix. Yes they were yummy, but I will keep this recipe for cold weather when it isn't so much fun to make s'mores around the camp fire.

I made these with a double batch of "MMMMM... Brownies" on Allrecipes, two cups of mini marshmallows, and six Hershey's bars. I had to bake them for much longer than normal. I just kept setting the timer for five minutes and I probably reset it theee times, and I was still not confident they were completely done. But they turned out absolutely perfect. You can't imagine how amazing they are until you try them. Wow.

This was yummy! Like the others say, cook the brownies longer before putting the marshmallows on.  i did 25 minutes, and they were undercooked but that could be a good thing, when they first came .  I also used ghirardelli brownie mix, which is very fudgy, but if you like your brownies cake like, maybe cook completely before putting the topping on. Otherwise I thought they were awesome, but my 12 year old wasnt crazy about the texture

I USED THIS AS A GUIDE AND MADE SUNDAY MORNING WITH MY BOYS A BLAST! I USED DH CHEWY FUDGE BROWNIE MIX PREPARED AND BAKED IN A ROUND CAKE BAN FOR 20 MINUTES. PULLED THEM OUT OF THE OVEN AND TOPPED EVENLY WITH 9 OF THE LARGE PUFFED MARSHMELLOWS.. PLACING THEM BACK IN OVEN AND CHANGING THE SETTING TO BROIL JUST FOR A MINUTE TO GET THAT NICE BROWN TONE ON THE TOP. AFTER TOASTING THE MARSH MELLOWS I TOOK A SPATULA TO QUICKLY SPREAD THEM DOWN AND AROUND THE BROWNIE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE SIDES OF THE PAN.. WE THEN FINISHED OFF THE TOPPINGS BY SPRINKLING THE CRUSHED GRAHAM CRACKERS AND MINI SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS! 

BY FAR THE BEST BROWNIES I HAVE EVER MADE AND SO MUCH FUN BEING ABLE TO MAKE THEM WITH MY BABIES! THEY WERE SO HAPPY LAST WEEK THAT THEY ARE EXCITED TO GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN WITH ME!!

Have tried this several times and decided to check Allrecipes to see if other people had better advice.  You do!  Adding the marshmallows and graham crackers earlier made a much better presentation.  When I make them, I have chocolate chips in the brownies, and drizzle carmel on the top of the marshmallow/ graham mix.  :)

Followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome.  That's no surprise though, how could this recipe possibly be anything but delicious?  Brownies + Smores is delicious.

Pretty good. Graham cracker pieces on top turned out soft. If I remake I will crumble them into more of a crust topping

Really really good! I cut back on the chocolate bars, graham crackers and marshmallows abit, but add chopped snickers bars on top! Yummy! I baked the brownies according to directions on box, pulled them out 10 min. before they were supposed to be done, and added all the goodies! I have made 3 batches of them already!

I had high hopes for these brownies.  I made them for a party, and while they were all gone by the end of the night, I found them too dry.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions about adding the topping later in the baking time in hopes of not drying the topping out, but unfortunately, it didn't seem to work.  I think the basic premise of these brownies is a great idea, but I won't be using this recipe again.

Super fun brownie topping idea!  I don't even like s'mores, but I made a selection of flavored brownies for an ice cream social at work and these were the biggest surprize.  I used the Healthier best brownies recipe instead of box mix and they rocked!  Althought next time I'll probally bake the topping for a few mins less so the marshmallows don't melt quite so much

Turned out great. Family ate the whole pan in a day.  Used a larger pan than required so came out thin.  So glad I did because its very rich.  Next time will try 6 candy bars and 2 cups marshmallow as other reviewers have recommended

This is super quick and easy...and yummy too :)  I did follow others advice and baked the brownies alone for a little longer and put the toppings on for the last 5-7 minutes of banking time...turned out perfect both times :)

Only change was I used graham cereal pieces, and only 3 candy bars which seemed like more than enough. No difficuly getting out of pan or cutting. I used parchment and cut brownies with a plastic knife. I wanted to make these all summer, and finally got around to it on the first day of fall.

This is a fun recipe that got rave reviews. I would definitely suggest crumbling the graham crackers into smaller pieces and putting the ingredients on for the last 5-7 minutes so they don't get too dried out and hard. Enjoy making these! :)

This was AMAZING - I used the family size box of brownies and 6 full Hershey bars. My husband couldn't get enough! They came out a little doughy in the center - but there were no complaints. Totally tasted like fudge. Not making ordinary brownies anymore while this is an option!!!

These are beyond delicious! People did not stop eating them until the pan was empty.  I also increased the marshmallow and graham crackers and cut back on the chocolate and did not put the toppings on until 5 minutes before they were done
I thought they were even better the next day after baking.
I would cover the brownies after you put the toppings on- it may add a few minutes to the bake time but the toppings will keep from browning.

I doubt I'll try this one again. The toppings separated from the brownie, and the marshmallows were overcooked, even though I baked it at the right temp for the right time. I would suggest maybe baking the brownie part until it's almost done, then add the toppings and bake just to melt them. I think better results might be obtained by using a frosting to pour over the graham crackers and marshmallows, rocky-road style.

This one is about as rich as you can get.  It's wonderful and really chocolatey, but I could only eat a bite or two.  I even cut the amount of chocolate chips in half.  I really like this recipe, but I'm unsure if I will make it again for my family.  It would be good for a potluck.  I added the toppings for the last 10 minutes and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't really have anything to add other reviewers haven't already said.  I would only put the topping on the last 5-10 minutes as mine was slightly burnt although that didn't stop anyone from eating them.  They are very rich.

i wasn't all that impressed with these.  they were good, don't get me wrong, but they didn't really remind me of smores at all.  i halved the recipe and just made my usual brownie recipe for the base and they were decent.  definitely yummy (what brownie isn't?), but no astonishing "smores without the campfire" taste.  i added the toppings (only used 2 candy bars for 1/2 the recipe and that was plenty) during the last 5 minutes which worked well.  cutting them with a knife dipped in hot water between each cut makes that part really easy.  so, nothing fantastic, but if you're looking for a brownie variation that looks pretty, this is a good recipe.

These brownies required about 15 minutes more cooking time than the recipe stated.  If I make again I would break the graham crackers up into even smaller pieces.

Yikes, this is one rich brownie recipe!  I had to scale everything back a little because I only had an 18 oz. box of brownie mix.  It was no fat, by the way, which didn't effect the flavor.  The chocolate pieces didn't melt at all so there are hunks of chocolate on top of an already rich brownie.  I took others' advice and waited a little longer to add the marshmallow mix and didn't have any burning whatsoever.  If I made this again, I think I would add more water to the brownie portion to make it more cake-like and perhaps cut down a little on the richness.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used Teddy Grahams and put the toppings on in the last 5 minutes.  They were really good, very sweet and rich!  With the Teddy Grahams, they'd be a fun dessert for a children's party.

These were awesome! I had some people over and made them for dessert, and they were a huge hit. I halved the recipe since there were only four of us, but I barely had any left after they left! I'd DEFINITELY wait longer to put the toppings on and crumble the graham crackers smaller. Also, I had problems testing if the brownies were done. Don't know how to fix that one...thanks for an awesome idea!

Even though I'd read all the reviews prior and used some of the suggestions this still came out quite a mess.  It was hard to cut & get out of the pan and looked horrible.  I won't be making this again....sorry.

Wow...what a mess.  I read every review, and still it disappointed.  Way too rich, didn't taste like s'mores at all, and the marshmallows looked awful, even after cooled and cut. The choc chips idea instead of choc bar sure worked, however.  Some things shouldn't be combined....maybe if the base was something less rich than a brownie....better luck next time.
