I loved these, especially the lemon-yogurt sauce.  I found that I had to freeze the cakes for about 20 minutes so they wouldn't fall apart.  I pan seared them instead of grilling.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe, both the burgers and the sauce, exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing.  I used my Weber Smokey Joe to grill them, making sure to slow things down a bit by closing vents and covering after coals were well-lit (white with ash). Then crack the vents (upper & lower) throw on a handful of pre-soaked hickory chips, and gently grill your burgers (lid on!) Don't overcook! Olive oil both grill and burgers first. Use your hand along with the spatula when turning. Make extra sauce... you'll want to use it on more than these salmon burgers... trust me. Enjoy. I sure did!

Best salmon recipe I ever had! Added fresh dill from my garden along with the other herbs/spices, and fried them in a cast iron skillet. I plan to make again for sure!

There is no comparison using fresh instead of canned salmon.  Followed the recipes except added a little dill to both the salmon and the sauce.  No buns, just greens and tomato slices. Will definitely make this again.  They are just as good cold the next day.

The flavor was good, easy enough to make. Because the patties are so thick, I felt like the outer part got overcooked to make sure the inside was cooked thoroughly. It was OK, but I probably won't make it again.

These were delicious because there is not a lot of ingredients, all you taste is salmon!  I was not convinced mine would stay together so after forming each patty I covered them lightly with additional bread crumbs and refrigerated for a couple of hours. I used plain panko crumbs.  They were a nice change from our usual roasted salmon.

Excellent! I made it exactly as described but cut the recipe in 1/2. We both really liked it, unusual since we don't share the same taste in food. This will be a regular at ur house.

This was excellent!  Tried it for something different and will definitely make again. We skipped the buns but kept the sauce. The sauce was also a keeper.

This is a very good recipe.  I fried the patties in a non-stick pan with a little olive oil.  I used Old Bay seasoning, and followed the recipe as is.  It was a bit too salty for my taste.   Either reduce the amount of Old Bay, or reduce/eliminate the salt.  Otherwise this is very tasty.

Very good! I believe recipes are only general guidelines so .... I Used sautéed regular onions since  I don’t do green onions. Added some garlic because garlic makes everything better.  For the sauce I substituted garlic for the green onions.  Used way less parsley, added a light pinch of dill and Old Bay Seasoning.

It took forever to make (2 hours for 3 servings), but it was excellent! My husband and I both loved it! Next tine, we’ll try to get salmon without the skin and bone to speed up prep time.

I found this to be by far the best mixture and consistency, not to mention flavor, for a fish burger/cake.  I refrigerated them for an hour before grilling in a cast iron pan.  You can freeze them for 10-20 minutes if in a hurry.  They held together wonderfully!

These were so good!!!  My whole family loved these.  I was nervous if they would stay together or not since they were made up of mostly salmon.  I ended up cooking them in a cast iron skillet which I will do next time as well.

I added fresh dill and garlic to both the salmon and the sauce. It's so good on its own, we skip the bun and serve it on top of the arugula tossed in a fresh lemon vinaigrette.

I just tried these last week and absolutely loved them!! I tried to follow exactly because to me, that's the only way to judge it fairly, however I didnt have exactly the same seasonings. I have a bottled seasoning mix that's a New Orleans blend that I really like and we dont like things too spicy or hot at all so I cut down on the total amount of seasonings that were called for. I also cooked mine in my large cast iron skillet and got a nice seared outside on them. (yes you have to be careful when you turn them over!) And we did not eat them on buns, just played them and served with potato salad.  The reason for 4 stars is the sauce. They def would have been even better with some kind of sauce, but not the one in the recipe. I'm sorry but I made it exactly as written, in fact I doubled it as a few reviewers suggested, because they loved it so much, but all I tasted was yogurt! I'm not a fan of plain yogurt, and that's all it tasted like. Even after sitting for awhile, no other flavor came through. So...I'm in need of a good salmon sauce, but as far as salmon pattys(burgers)go, these are #1 in my book!

This was amazingly fresh tasting and sooo much better than old time salmon patties with canned salmon. So moist and flavorful. Worth the extra time to cut up the fresh salmon.
