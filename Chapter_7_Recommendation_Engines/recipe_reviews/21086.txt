For those who are changing the recipe to what they think the submitter intended, the "sour cream" comes from the combination of vinegar (sour) and heavy cream (cream).  Cream can be soured with all sorts of things, including vinegar.  The person who posted this uses the words "cream" or "heavy cream" 4 times, it's unlikely to be a typo.  Give it a shot as written (it's pretty good).

I'd been looking for a recipe like my grandmother's, and this is VERY close.  She would slice the cucumber into thin rounds and press them overnight to remove the moisture. She also added sliced onions and let the entire mixture sit for several hours to allow the flavours to combine.

I love the simplicity of this dish.  I didn't realize you could make such delicious sour cream that way!!! Whenever I'm out and I need a substitute, I now have a recipe!!!  Love the combination of flavors.  I would think this would be great over salmon, too!

My grandmother and mother made a recipe almost like this for years and I continue to make it. The only difference is we add sugar (approx. 1 teas. for every couple of tablespoons of vinegar). I slice the cucumbers very thin using my mandoline slicer and then add the sour cream, vinegar, sugar, s&p, and mix it all together.  The addition of dill sounds great! I'll have to try it next time I make this. My husband loves this served over mashed potatos.

Heavy cream, I don't think so.....sour cream, yeas.  Cucumbers exude a lot of water, hence the heavy cream, being liquid, does not work well.  I have tried all the tricks in the book to not have too much liquid at the bottom of the bowl - to no avail - mayo works the best and no fuss, but the sour cream is delicious with added scallions, salt, pepper, chives and or dill - regardless, cucumbers are bottom line delicious in any form....

Great simple side dish!  I was actually trying to find MY grandmother's recipe, and this was it!  Altho, I have to say I add some onion.  It IS especially good over the mashed potatoes!

This is really delicious with almost any sandwich, burgers, brats, etc.  I used sour cream, as I assume was intended.  I mixed the cucumber slices with close to a teaspoon of salt and let them drain for about an hour before adding the other ingredients.  I also used white wine vinegar and about 1/2 teaspoon dried dill.  Be sure to chill well.  Almost addictive!

I remember my mother making this as a side dish but, she would slice onions and separate into rings fold the cucumbers, onions and sour cream or she might have concocted something similar with condensed milk, quite tasty!

Using heavy cream didn't sound appealing to use with cucumbers even by my friends who were over for munchies and a movie so in order to not waste too much by way of ingredients I made a 1/2 serving portion of the sauce using heavy cream and another using sour cream for taste testing first. Using sour cream won by a landslide. Thanks for a quick flavorful dressing idea though :-)

Fresh, simple, & delicious. Paired very well with BBQ-grilled Bratswurst, although it would go with almost anything, esp. spicy, grilled foods.Than ks for a recipe, to use again and again!

Just like I remember Mom's. I added fresh parsley & used fresh dill instead of dried. Great way to use up all my cukes. Thanks for a great submission!

Perfect easy salad chilled for summer. Great after a hot day!! We loved it. Also great to make ahead of time and stick it in the frige. I used heavy whipping cream, not sour cream. Mixing it with the vinager gave it the "sour cream" taste, but I added a bit more cream to take some of the tangyness out of it which made it more saucy than creamy. But still great!

Very good; similar to adding sour cream to the cucumbers and vinegar which is my traditional way of fixing cucumber salad.  By making the sauce from heavy cream separately it surely is versatile and would be good on a lot of things.  Thanks!

Wow. The heavy cream and vinegar makes sour cream. It was not a typo. To counter-act the water content, cut up cukes, salt and vinegar them, cover and refrigerate for about 1/2 hour then drain. I do add a little onions, though!  This is a great recipe!

We use to call this recipe Dutch Cucumbers. We used Salad Dressing a cap or two of White Vinegar a squeeze of lemon. Let it set a few hours before serving. Yummy!! I rate this a five.

Fantastic!  This is a really simple recipe, and different from other cucumber salads I've had in the past.  The only change I made was using about four or five fresh sprigs of dill and I added garlic powder.  I'll bet chopped water chestnuts would make a great addition as well.  Also, I let it chill for about four hours to let the flavors blend.  Yummy and it is on my low carb diet!!!

This was definitely not what I expected.  I don't believe heavy cream and cucumbers are meant to go together.  I'm not saying it was awful, but I think I only had about two bites.  Not too great.

I've not made this exact recipe.  I make mine using sour cream, white vinegar and, instead of sugar, I use white corn syrup since it's already dissolved.  If I don't have sour cream, I use plain Greek style yogurt, much healthier.  Marilyn

Wow these taste great and are very easy to make. Similar to the ones at the deli.

After reading the reviews, I, too, used sour instead of heavy cream. Good if you need a quick side using on-hand ingredients.

This was just OK - I used sour cream which I think this recipe meant to call for.  I would add some onions if I made it again.
