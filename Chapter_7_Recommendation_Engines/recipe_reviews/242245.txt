Zucchini – it’s good for breakfast too!  As an Italian who grew up with this humble dish herself (using the summer zucchini bounty from Grandma’s and Mom’s plentiful gardens) I can vouch for its satisfying deliciousness.  Or maybe I’m just swayed by sentimentality. While olive oil is a kitchen staple, in this instance I’ve always preferred to make this with butter.  And, while zucchini is a great foundation, it needn’t stop there.  I added onion and minced garlic today, but tomatoes and/or mushrooms are great additions as well.  To finish, I like a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan upon serving.

We make this a lot on the weekends, I like to add fresh sliced garlic while the zucchini is sautéing, sprinkle some oregano and hot pepper flakes to flavor it up.
  Serve it on a lightly toasted, buttered bakery roll and sprinkle with Parmesan.  Heaven!

08.13.16 ~ A good, simple and quick breakfast to prepare. I like veggies in my eggs but had never tried it with zucchini. I liked it. Added a few sliced tomatoes and a dry English muffin and had a delicious breakfast. (4-stars)

I have made this so many times...few pinches of Italian herbs add to it, and top with a bit of shredded Italian cheese

Delicious and healthy! I added garlic to the olive oil and sautéed it before adding the zucchini and eggs. I’d definitely make this again.

Fried up 1 medium zucchini, then added a chopped tomato and green onion w salt and pepper. Added an egg and some oregano. Nice, especially if I don't want to use cheese.

Great idea. I added about 1/4 of a white onion and 1 clove of garlic. Delicious.

Nice! I only had 1 smallish zucchini, but I thought that was plenty w/o being too much. This had a nice, fresh flavor...great for breakfast! Thanks for sharing. :)
