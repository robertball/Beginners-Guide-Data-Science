This was the first time I've made a biscotti type of cookie. Turned out both tasting good and very nice to look at! I made them per the recipe and have them in an air tight container to take to the Kea'au Christmas parade next week. Along with some peppermint schnapps to put in the hot coco!! Yummy

These are delicious but next time I will add more cherries.  I drizzled the tops with melted chocolate.

Very similar to a biscotti, this little cookie is wonderful with coffee or tea.  The cookie is not too sweet and has good flavor, but the next time I would omit the cinnamon sugar.

I started a Christmas tradition 2 years ago of making biscotti for my friends and coworkers. This time I used this recipe. This is by FAR the best biscotti I've ever made. I'm in LOVE with this cookie!

I didn't sprinkle with cinnamon sugar (not my taste). I used slightly less sugar than the recipe called for and would probably use only about 3/4 of a cup at most next time. I used candied cherries and increased the amount, and I used almonds. Very nice. I would not turn the temp to 400 or keep a better eye on it.

Seriously yummy! Also thought they were very pretty ~ I did not choose to add the cinnamon sugar topping but loved them just the same :)  Thank you for sharing ~
