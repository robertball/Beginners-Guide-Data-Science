It was really good and I've made it twice now. I normally cut down the chocolate milk because it really deletes the coffee part so I suggest lessening the amount and doing from one cup to one and a half only. Besides that it's super good. Also if you add a bit of maple syrup it makes it all the more sweeter and summery. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This was pretty good! Very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon! I thought the outcome was more like a chocolate milk shake than a coffee chocolate milk shake. I think using a stronger coffee for the ice cubes would help that. Definitely try this and if you like coffee then bump it up by using espresso or increase the instant coffee granules per water ratio. Thank you for your recipe.
