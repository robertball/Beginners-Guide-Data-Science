Tortilla Espanola, as this is called in Spain, is definitely part of the Spanish way of life.  They eat very light dinners over there and when I lived there we would have this at least twice a week (served with crusty bread and a simple lettuce salad dressed with vinegar and olive oil).  While I was in Seville, I was taught by a Spaniard I met there how to make this and this is pretty much what he taught me.  The only thing I really do differently is to stir the potatoes often while cooking so that they don't get browned.  You really want them to be very soft and tender, not crispy.  It's also worth noting that in some regions of Spain they do not use onions (I lived for a while in Salamanca, which is about 3 hours west of Madrid, and they never used onions there).  It's good either way but I find that when made with onions it is a little more moist.  I currently make it without because my boyfriend is allergic to onions.  Every time I saw this served in a home, it was simply made with just potatoes, eggs, and maybe onions.  I never saw anybody garnish it with tomatoes and green onion (or anything, really), although in restaurants they would often mix in other vegetables or ham so you can really add whatever you like.  Another tip I use is to determine when the eggs are fully cooked, insert a butter knife into the center of the tortilla.  If it comes out clean, it is done.

I have got to give this five stars, because it is just amazing. A Spanish friend made this for me once and this tastes just like hers, with the adjustments I made: I leave out the tomatoes and green onions (because she said in Spain they don't put them in), and it tastes so good without them that I can't bear to try it WITH them! :) 

One other tip: After I cook the potatoes and onions in oil, I put the eggs and potatoes together (combine very gently) in a bowl, and let it sit for 20-30 minutes. The cooked potatoes absorbs the egg, and it's just SO moist. 

Last thing... I find that the dish tastes best if I turn the heat off shortly before it feels right to do so. It still looks a teeny bit moist and eggy inside - but when I cook it any longer it gets much drier. Mmmmm moist! 

Thanks Patty!

Being a Spaniard, this recipe caught my attention. Tortilla de patata is truly a simple, rustic dish and it sounds like everyone's got the right idea. Having made this tortilla many times at home and with family in Spain-I have a couple tips to share. After cooking the sliced potatoes in olive oil, I drain them in a colander then put potatoes back into frying pan (a good non-stick works best!) After adding egg and pushing potatoes down so they're submerged as much as possible, I cover the pan and cook on very low heat-you can actually cook the tortilla all the way through this way and only need to invert onto a serving plate and cut into wedges to serve-although if you're using a non-stick, the inversion process is a snap. I'd never had Tortilla made with anything other than potato, egg, and onion UNTIL I experimented on my own. I sauteed chorizo, put half the potatoes in the pan sauteed chorizo on top of potato, rest of potatoes on top of chorizo, then egg over all. Really good! and a very nice presentation when sliced.

I would suggest that you sautee the onions first until brown and then add the potatoes. This way the oil gets all the flavor from the onions which then transfers to the potatoes.   As far as garnish, we really (I am from Spain) don't garnish it with anything but hey it doesn't hurt either. We eat it with bread which is very similar to french baguette. This is the typical "Pincho de tortilla" that you can get at every bar.  The only thing I was surprised with was the picture, because it looks scrambled and it is suppose to look like a pie (more or less). It is not that hard to turn it. Make sure you put enough oil in the non-stick pan, put a plate bigger that the pan on top of the pan and if you are afraid it may slip put a piece of paper towel on two sides of the pan (in between the pan and the dish) and then flip it with a quick move. That's a trick my mom showed me when I first started cooking.

I lived in Spain for 4 months and "Spanish tortilla" is a favorite of mine...I omitted the tomatoes and green onions and it tasted like I was back in Madrid!

I added some green pepper in with the onion. I wasn't even going to attempt turning it over as I'm very accident prone. So I did what I always do with omelettes,once the egg mixture had set I put it under the broiler on medium heat until golden brown. I ended up with fluffy omelettes we all enjoyed. Thanks

I was raised in Spain and this is definitely a simple and delicious recipe that is just like "home" for me. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do not use tomatoes or green onions with a potato omelet in Spain! Also, we lived in Southern Andalucia, which might be different, but we always cubed our potatoes and fried them until tender (not crispy).  As other reviewers have noted, the traditional step is to then mix the eggs, onions & potatoes in a bowl together, letting them sit for a few minutes before cooking the omelet. This is an extremely simple and completely delicious recipe! All my American friends like to dip their bites of potato omelet in KETCHUP when they eat it...whatever works!  :-)

I thought this recipe was great. I even made it the night before for breakfast because my husband gets up early. It was definitely better when it was hot. I made some adjustments based on what other reviews stated. I personally didn't use as much olive oil because it started to splatter all over. I cubed the potatoes and cooked them in the microwave with a little bit of water. I diced the onion and added red pepper when I added the onion. I used 6 eggs instead of 4. And I skipped the tomatoes and the green onions. This recipe is actually really easy and really good. Be sure to use enough salt and pepper to flavor it. Thanks!

This was a great way to wake up on a BEAUTIFUL Sat morning (esspecially after a rough night before)! I diced the potatoes and cooked them in the microwave for about 5 min B4 cooking them in the pan to speed up the cooking proces and diced the onions instead of slicing. I also added half a green bell pepper (chopped). Besides adding S&P to the eggs, I also added 1/4c milk so that they would still be fluffy. Not going to lie to you: it was tricky getting the eggs to transfer to the plate and then inverting them uncooked side down again back into the pan BUT the end result was very tasty. Finally, I didn't use the tomatoes but just the green onions and cheese. With a side of sausage, these made for a great breakfast.

Pretty good. 4 stars as I don't think it's as good as the original. I've been cooking Tortilla Papas for my family for more than eighteen years. Like others, I don't use much more than potatoes, onions/garlic, salt and pepper, and olive oil. I, too, do not brown the potatoes. I, too, add the cooked potatoes to the bowl of beaten (well-salted) eggs along with a dollop of olive oil and allow it to sit for a half hour. This is the way traditional tortilla is made--but there are other types/fillings, too. I serve it either hot or cold, cut into wedges. One word of caution, though: if planning to serve cold, DO NOT WRAP UNTIL THE TORTILLA HAS COMPLETELY COOLED! Doing so may/will cause a chemical/steam/heat reaction in the eggs--they'll turn green (like green eggs and ham). It will still taste good, but will look weird (my son took an entire 14" tortilla to school for an international potluck; being impatient, he wrapped it before it cooled and discovered this the hard way).

This was good..pretend its an egg tortilla and put whatever you like for the topping... Never had my potatoes in the omelet itself but it was worth it...
I always mix my eggs and potatoes in the diner as I'm sure most do, so what the heck.. It was pretty good and real easy.

Try it the traditional way: olive oil, potatoes, eggs, salt & pepper only. Let the potatoes get soft, but not brown & crispy. In Spain, many people choose to eat this tortilla espanola con mayonesa (with mayonnaise for dipping). If you are afraid of inverting the omelet then try using an oven-proof pan and once the bottom is set transfer it to the oven at 350 degrees until it's set. Works like a charm.

This is 5 stars after a few modifications.  I am not sure how this dish feeds six since my normal sized husband and I shared this and finished it.  I also wish it would have specified how long to cook this on low.  It took so long that I finally kicked the heat up to medium.  Can anyone let us know cook times?  Please be careful with over plate flipping because I ended up having my omelet crash back into the pan and break up.  I also think you only need 3/4 of a large onion and 1 large tomato.  3 TBS of oil is the perfect amount.  To "Americanize" this dish I heated the potatoes for 3 mins on 80% power before cooking as someone else suggested (they were perfect), I warmed up the tomatoes for 20 seconds, and covered the omelet with cheddar cheese shreds before garnish.  I couldn't imagine eating an omelet without cheese.  I will make this again, it tasted so gourmet!!

This looked and tasted wonderful. I cut down the oil by half and it still cooked well. Also, i'm not a fan of cold food on my hot food, so I put the tomatoe and green onion on top of the omelets when they were in the pan still right at the end and covered with a sprinkle of reduced fat cheddar which helped to hold them to the omelet. I removed as soon as the cheese had melted.

YUM!!! I served this for lunch and it was a big hit. I cut the oil to 3 T. (no more is needed) and to ensure the potatoes would be soft I nuked them in the microwave for three minutes on 80% power. Like other reviewers, I omitted the tomato and green onion. This was very filling and really delicious.

yummmm!  my italian grandmother used to make me this as a kid....it brought back such good, cozy,memories.I really think the tip about mixing the cooked potatoes with the beaten eggs then pouring it all back into the fry pan , was a great help with it setting up evenly.

I was putting this omelet together and for some reason thought the recipe called for spinach. I didn't add a whole lot so i don't think it altered the recipe as far as taste goes. I really loved the potatoes with the egg. The fresh spinach went nicely together too. I will definitely make this again...with the spinach! YUM!

I thought this tasted really good. I did find it hard to use a full 1/2 cup of olive oil, but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time. It was actually quite quick to make and very filling. I sliced the potatoes on my cheese grater and it made thin slices quickly. The potatoes and onions browned up pretty fast. I would like to try to make this again using half the amount of oil and see the results, as it was a tad greasy in my opinion. Plus, in reality this seems to make 2 large or 3 small servings and not 6 at all. It was nice to make something with what I had in the house that was tasty to.

I guess this tastes like an authentic Spanish Omelet, it's just not that interesting. I added more vegetables (green bell pepper) but followed the recipe otherwise. It was better the next day, so I might make it again for a picnic some day.

Excellent recipe for a Spanish tortilla!! Just like the tortillas my señora made for me while I was studying abroad in Sevilla.   (The name should include the word "tortilla," so the recipe will pop up when someone searches for "tortilla." It didn't pop up when I was looking for a tortilla recipe, so it took me a while to find it.)  Also, the main picture does not make it look like a tortilla at all, so the picture should probably be changed to give people a better idea of what it's supposed to look like.

More patience and medium heat for the small-cubed potatoes work better for me. Added some sliced red chilli for a spicy touch (can't help being Malaysian!).
Pan tip: After sliding omelette onto a big plate. Invert pan over the omelette and turn the whole plate/pan combo over. Then place pan back on stove. Easy!

Absolutely Awesome!!!
Thanks, Patty5!  I did add a little more potato, used a cup of egg beaters and 2 real eggs, and only about half of the olive oil.  My only change for next time is to use the same (large) frying pan to cook everything in, and then transfer it to a smaller one before I add the egg mixture...my pan was so big, it tended to make the eggs thin...also hard to flip, but that's not the recipe's fault!  The tomatoes (LOVE YOU JOANIE!) and scallions put it over the top!  Thanks again!  Another staple in my recipe mix!

It was OK, needed lots of tweaking, not good as written, WAY too much oil!

We thought this was pretty good.  Its a keeper!  I didnt use as much olive oil as the recipe stated, probably used 6T.  I put the tomatoes and green onions on the omelette before it was completely cooked.  Instead of flipping I covered and cooked on low til it was done.  Oh, and I threw on some shredded cheddar.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a really quick and easy recipe, and I liked that the ingredients are things I always have on hand. I used a little less oil and onions, and seasoned the potatoes with Adobo. And I left out the tomatoes and green onions. I ended up making a 2nd batch right away because my family enjoyed the first batch so much and wanted more.

I love eggs....I love potatoes...and onions! SO obviously I loved this recipe haha. I didn't modify this much except when I needed to substitute for ingredients I didn't have at the moment.  People may run into problems while trying to keep the potatoes crispy.  This means managing the fire, etc.  Nonetheless, such a great, simple breakfast.. This has saved me from starving when I had nothing else on hand to start my day. :)

Loved this! I served this for brunch today with a side of salsa and it was so easy.  I boiled the potatoes in the micowave in a bowl of water so that the potateos wouldn't need to soak up as much oil to cook. I followed the recipe except I used half the oil. Next time I would leave out the tomatoes and green onions on top. Yum!

So simple, but still very good.  I used the food processor to slice the potatoes and onions paper thin, so they cooked very quickly.  I also used egg beaters to make it a little healthier.  Definitely will make again.

Surprisingly good and so easy! We will occasionally have "breakfast" for dinner and it's hearty enough as a main dish, although you might want to make extra if there are more than 2 people. My husband loved it and so did my 2 1/2 year old even with onions. We skipped the tomato and green onion garnish and it was tasty on its own. Served it with bread and a side of veggies.

This is my girlfriends favorite breakfast and she is a very picky breakfast person. This recipe is wonderful as it is, the only thing I occasionally change is I add another potato or two. They tend to cook down to nothin.  Thanks for the recipe!

I grew up on this recipe and have made it for the 30+ years I've been cooking! My father was from Kansas, and I always thought it was a US-mid-west recipe!  So I've learned something new here (does this mean I can now say I'm experienced in Spanish cuisine?)  LOL!  
This recipe is great - it's real comfort food to my family and very quick and easy to make!  
(btw - my mother always just called this Potato - Onions & Eggs!

Tasty and easy!!  Made this for my husband yesterday morning, and he thought it was great.  Make sure you use a non-stick pan if you can, and I also used 6 eggs instead of four to make it more "eggy".

Excellent! Adding to my regular rotation for Meatless Mondays. I was pleasantly surprised when hubby admitted to liking this as well because he does not normally tolerate anything with potatoes. Thanks for posting. I made this exactly as instructed except served sliced tomatoes and green onions on the side instead of on top. Really quite good.

I had this dish on a recent trip to Puerto Rico and had to come home and make it.  The version I had only had potatoes and a small amount of onion diced so that is what I used.  I cooked the potatoes until soft, but not crispy.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and drain the potatoes after cooking them to remove most of the olive oil.  I will make it again with that change.

I didn't have any green onion on hand. 

I added cilantro, parsley, and parmesan. 

Turned out great!

This recipe is easy, delicious, and uses ingredients you probably already have on hand.  I used a bag of small, colorful potatoes from Trader Joe's.  Next time I might add one or two eggs, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!!

This is an old standby in our house, learned from a relative from Spain.  It had been a while since I'd made it, and seeing this reminded me.  Thanks for the reminder, I made it today for lunch.  A hit as always.  The one thing I do differently is skip the onions, as my husband loathes them.  I made such a big tortilla today, that I finished it off under the broiler rather than flipping it.  Good with salsa or ketchup, if you like those condiments.

Thank you for the recommend, MI$$DREA. I made this for my husband and I this morning. Only thing different I did was use butter instead of EVOO and added shredded white cheddar. I browned the heck out of my potatoes as we like them more done. Very good. We haven't had a GOOD omelette since we got back from Vegas.....we were quiet happy with this.

This was delicious.  I cut the potatoes and onion potato chip thin on a mandoline type slicer, and threw in a handful of mushrooms.  Topped with chipotle Tabasco, this made an awesome Lenten Friday supper.

This was very good! I just made it for breakfast and it was delicious! I made it without the salsa on the side and added a bit of grated cheese on top...was very tasty and very filling! Thank you for this recipe! Will definately make again!

This was pretty tasty, although I made mine more like a scramble than an omelet. I fried up the potatoes and onions first, and then poured in the eggs and scrambled everything together. I also cooked the tomatoes instead of adding them at the end, but skipped the green onion. By scrambling it all together, I think I shaved a considerable amount of time on the cooking process. I added about a 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar, and that was really tasty. Next time, I think I'll add green pepper.

I really loved it....simple and delicious.  Although it's a very greasy dish but a treat won't hurt once in a while.  I used season-all and pepper for the potatoes and s&p for the eggs.

My friend from Barcelona taught me how to make this 2 months ago & I've made it for my family 5 times since - my 2 kids & my "meat loving" husband love this & if have it for dinner w/o meat, everyone is happy. My friend taught me a time saving trick for busy moms that does not change the flavor - she cooks the sliced potatoes w/ the onion & olive oil in a glass pyrex dish in the microwave for 7 minutes or so, or until they're tender. I have a newborn baby & less time, and found a great bag of frozen hash browns at Trader Joe's, no ingredients other than potatoes; I throw the bag in the microwave for 5 minutes with the onion, olive oil, salt/pepper (uncovered in a glass pyrex dish). Then cook the omelette with 7 eggs, use plenty of oil for when you flip it. So good at room temp., better than hot. No other additions. YUM!

I love this dish. I first found it at a restaurant in Spain. However, the spaniards call it Tortilla Española. Basic ingredients such as eggs and potatoes are crucial but you can add anything to the mixture that you want such as tomatoes, ham, cheese, (and since I'm from New Mexico) I add green chili. Don't forget to add a generous amount of salt. You don't want to overpower the recipe with it but it is a crucial flavor for the eggs and also helps keep the dish from falling apart.

I was late getting up and really hungry so I started with potatoes O'Brian thawed in mw. Added to onions already in pan, added smoked paprika and chipotle chile powder. Added eggs and covered the pan to hasten cooking and whoa, I turned it over without incident! Oh, I added parsley to the eggs while I was whisking them. Delicious. Will definitely make again. Took no more than 15 minutes including prep.

I thought this was missing something liked diced jalapenos. I didn't feel that it was necessary to flip the eggs over. I just placed a lid over the pan and cooked the eggs on low heat until done.

Pretty good! I made this with mostly defrosted hash browns because I was looking for something quick. I sauteed the onions first as one reviewer suggested, especially since I knew I wasn't cooking it very long. I flopped a little on the flip, but made it using a large circular platter. Should only have added pepper once, I think. Served it with a little shredded sharp cheese & optional salsa instead of tomatoes. Toast & baby carrots made it a quick light supper!

This was such an easy and yummy recipe.
I made it for a spanish project, and it came out delicious!
Definitely buy some parsley or green onions for garnish though, as without it, the dish looks yellow (and sad).
Also, if you are reheating the dish for leftovers, re-cook it on the stove rather than the microwave. It just tastes better.

I am always searching for vegetarian recipes for my 'meatless mondays.'  This Spanish Potato omelet was very tasty.  I made a few changes using some things I had on hand; green pepper, fresh basil springled on top, and a little shredded ceddar cheese.  very good

As others did, I omitted the tomatoes and green onions, although I'm sure it's probably good as well.  Used a mandolin to get really thin evenly sliced potatoes.  The plate transfer method seemed intimidating to me, so I cooked until about 2/3 set, loosened with spatula and did a pan flip with success.  Very tasty with salsa on the side.

Yes, a good recipe, but can be made even thicker by using up to a dozen eggs, and, for variety, plantains, or "platanos".  For this much volume, two ten inch cast iron frying pans are needed because the flip should be into a hot pan so all the uncooked egg doesn't run away.  The Spanish lady who taught me this was from Andalusia, and always used plantains, preferably unsweet, and ground a considerable quantity of salt and garlilc in a tall wood mortar and pestle.  With the pepper and paprika, it was, of course, delicious.  The salt and garlic allowed it to remain at room temperature without spoilage for two to three days if covered.

I just made this for the second time. I cut the potatoes thinner this time around, added a little garlic witht he sliced onion, a little mozarella on the top and finished it with the chopped tomato and a little tobasco. I'm eating in my bedroom and I have no idea what the other people in the house think must be going on in here. Fantastic!

this cooking method made very simple ingredients look surprisingly impressive. i used my food processor and added chorizo. this paired nicely with a fruit salad. Update: Made this again but added leftover corn chips with the potatoes and added spinach with the eggs this time. Delicious! I love this recipe because it uses very few ingredients when you are low on groceries but yields impressive results.

DH wanted omlets for dinner so I decided to give this one a try. I didn't add the tomato and garnished with a bit of green onion and they were soooo good!!! It is a bit tricky to turn it out of the pan and back in but I used a pizza pan and it wasnt that bad and only made a slight mess, lol. I will be using this one again since we enjoyed it so much. Simple and tasty!!

I really love the combination of potatoes, onions, and egg for a quick meal.  I've made and eaten this many times; my German grandmother frequently made it with leftover baked potatoes.  I like to garnish this with fresh cilantro, parsley, and chives and I think it's wonderful as a "tortilla" or as a scramble.

I was a bit skeptical with this recipe because it seems plain and too easy. Decided to give this a try though to use up potatoes and they came out very good. Omitted the spring onion and tomatoes since that's how they serve them in Spain. This definitely brought as back and is good served hot or cold. Thanks!

I hate to rate this low, but this was a VERY plain omelet.  I was not impressed at all.  The only thing I tasted was potato, even with quite a bit of salt and pepper.  I followed the recipe to a T.  Yes, it is very easy to make, so I gave it 1 star.  My father liked it, so it got another star.  It just lacked flavor in my book.  But, maybe, having never been to Spain, bland is how it was supposed to be?  Thank you for sharing.  I am sorry to rate it so low.

This was a great base to use for an omlette, absolutely delicious! Instead of tomatoes and spring onion which I didn't have, I added chopped ham, broccoli and mushrooms to make it go a bit further and add some nutrition. Best omlette I've ever made!

I don't know much about spanish cuisine but this omelet made for a delicious sunday morning breakfast. Unlike most,I added the tomato and green onion garnish and i'm glad i did. I also added garlic and cheddar cheese. I did follow the advise of the reviewer who put it under the broiler to cook the top, as i didn't want to attempt to flip it. With my luck i would have had to eat it off the kitchen floor!

This was so good! I omitted the tomatoes and green onions at the advice of the reviewers who ate this in Spain. My omelet fell apart during the inversion process, but I just need practice. If you like potatoes, you'll like this omelet.

Delicious.  I used half an onion, two potatos, a head of broccoli in floretts, a handful of sugar snap peas and 5 baby corn cobs, six eggs.  I didnt have any meat so just used a tablespoon of chicken stock.  Seasoned with black pepper, and garlic salt.  Fabulous.

...I love the potato omelet this produces..Used leftover baked potatoes and they fried up beautifully.  Since they were already cooked I browned them in butter rather than evoo...whipped up the eggs with aprox 3 Tbls of water and rather than a diced tomato and gr onion garnish I topped with shredded cheddar and picante sauce..REALLY GOOD!..especially with a cold glass of fresh O.J...:)

Very good omelet! I cut the recipe in half because 4 eggs makes more than one person can eat. I used a diced red potato, and I also added some mushrooms and lots of cheese. I didn't have fresh onions on hand, so I used chopped onion from the spice rack. I will make these often.

Tasty & easy.  A nice change from the traditional omelet.  I added just a 1/4 cup of cooked ground sausage to give it some added zest.

I have been making something like this for 20 years.  I have an easy & quick way to cook this.  I cook the onion & bell peppers 1st  until tender & then I add a can of drained cubed potatoes to the pan .  They also make canned sliced potatoes -just be sure to drain well.   This eliminates the need to precook in the microwave & saves time because you don't have to peel & slice.  I prefer the potatoes soft but cook to your desired brownness.  Then add the eggs.  This saves so much time on busy mornings

I travelled to Spain a year ago and this was on my list of dishes to try there.  I did have a couple of versions there and really enjoyed each.  I made this recipe exactly as written and found it was missing something. Maybe my medium onion was too big as it seemed to be overpowered with onion.  I was concerned with the amount of oil and would like to try par cooking the potatoes in water and then crisping in a lot less oil.
Otherwise the method was quick and easy and an excellent option for a simple meal served with salad or a slice of meat.

A very nice meal option. I do agree to cook the onion a bit first and use WAY less oil. I also used shredded frozen hash brown potatoes and think they work really well. Will definitely keep this in the rotation.

Good, easy recipe. I left the skin on the potatoes as a preference; however that made the edges a little discoloured so don't do the same if that would bother you. Served with tomato wedges and green onions. Because the omelette is (supposed to be) plain, I made some flavourful dill bread with cream cheese on the side. A pot of strong coffee rounded out a great breakfast!

I am so glad I tried this recipe. It tastes exactly the way I remember the omelets in Spain tasting, when I visited many years ago. I didn't change a thing. Fantastic, just like it is! I will probably be making this a lot now that I found it.

This was really yummy. I added too much pepper and made it a little hot, but it was still delicious. I ate this as a child from someone from Spain "Amelia", she made the best, this brought back memories. Thanks.

This tastes delicious and is perfect for breakfast or dinner! Two things I will need to address next time I fix this: 1) Too much oil. I think I could cut it in half. 2) This time, I added the onions when I turned the potatoes over but then had to remove the browned potatoes so the onions could cook further. Perhaps next time, I should add them halfway through the cooking time of the first side, at maybe the 5 minute mark? There will definitely be a next as this is a delicious, filling meal.

Sometimes the best recipes are the easiest.  This is one of those.   Just a few ingredients with a lot of taste.  Eggs, potatoes and onions with a little salt and pepper.  I didn't have any tomatoes so I put some salsa on top.  Very tasty and very easy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I modified the process a bit. Instead of turning the omlette, I broiled it for two minutes, which gave it a good texture too. My wife liked it. Thank you for the recipe.

I was looking for directions on how to make a Spanish Omelet, and this one fit the bill. My visiting Basque (Spain) student made one for us, and I couldn't recall exactly how she did it. This recipe refreshed my memory. This was good, but only 4 stars bc not as fantastic as the one I had before. I think she used fewer potatoes and more eggs.  She cut them up into cubes and cooked them with a little water in the microwave first to speed things up. I did that too, and did not make them crispy as the recipe states. I also used more eggs...I ended up using 7 eggs for 2 adults and 3 kids and we ate it all. I did not use the tomato or green onions. It was good and we enjoyed it. I'll just use less potatoes next time. I think this is an authentic recipe...it's just up to individual tastes as to how much and what kind of veggies to include. Thanks! Update: I tried this again, with 1/2 pound (2 small) potatoes sliced very thin, one LARGE onion and 7 eggs. Next time I will use maybe 10 eggs.

Great breakfast start.  I topped with sliced black olives, green and red bell peppers to add a variety of color. I skipped the  part about inverting the omelette into a second pan. Instead I simply folded the omelette in half down the middle to form a half-moon or crepe-like shape. Would make it again!

I made this for my grandparent's breakfast and they were very pleased.  I used left-over potatoes from the night before, so I skipped having to cook them and also added some left-over pork and ham.  I used 5 eggs and had to use a white onion since I was out of green.  I also threw in a handful of fresh cilantro which gave it a wonderful flavor.  Thanks

Love this recipe for an authentic Spanish Tortilla.  I double the eggs to 8 or 9 to fill my cast iron skillet.  Adding red pepper or jalapeno wouldn't be authentic, but would be delicious.

I used slightly less olive oil and skipped the tomatoes and green onions because I didn't have them. I also followed suggestions of finishing it off in the oven because I have never successfully flipped an omelet in my life. It was delicious -- pure simple goodness. We all loved it.

My husband is a Spaniard and makes this frequently. It normally does not have any other vegetables with the potato and egg. Some Spaniards like it with onion but many wouldn't consider adding it at all!

I made this in the traditional way without the addition of tomato, and rather than risk a broken soggy mess by inverting the pan over a plate, I placed the omelet under the grill briefly until the top was cooked. This needs to be seasoned well otherwise the combination of eggs and potato could be bland. The addition of tomato and a green salad on the side would make this a very attractive meal. At the point of grilling next time,  I will try a sprinkle of strong cheese over the top.

I made this Tortilla Española and it was good.  I fried some pancetta first.  I removed the pancetta, added some olive oil to the pan, and followed the recipe.  I added the pancetta back when I added the onions.  I also used grape tomatoes, parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to put on top of the Tortilla.  Delicious brunch!

I make a version of this almost every day for my husband to eat on his way to school.  Depending on what else I have in the fridge, it might have cheese, some ham, left-over chicken or black beans.  But always potatoes, onion and tomatoes.  I toss it into a big burrito for him and he is off to work happy, healthy and satisfied for the morning.

I made this today and my family loved it. I second another reviewer to cook the onions in the oil first.  Put them aside, cook the potatoes and add them back. So flavorful.  I added a little paprika, garlic and cheese too.  Oh, I shredded the potatoes instead of slices.  I like the texture better. You just have to make sure to squeeze out the excess liquid from the potatoes before cooking. The cook qyickerthis way to me.

Way more amazing than I was expecting! It pays to take your time with it. 

Sidenote: I didn't have a big enough plate to flip it on to, so I quartered it and used a couple large spatulas to turn it over.

I make my omelets like this;
But instead of turning it out on a plate I use my broiler to cook the 'top' while the pan side stays right side up and I just turn it out on a plate when it's done.

Here in Greece, we make a similar omelet, but without the tomatoes & onion. I always cut the potatoes in the shape of French fries (I have an attachment for my food processor that makes this quick & easy) - for me it is easier to cook this way than using sliced or diced potatoes. Next time I make it I will try it with onions - sounds good. I use my biggest dinner plate to turn it over - have never had a problem. My family always loves this dish - makes a quick supper with a simple tomato or green salad. Yum - makes me want to rush to the kitchen to make it NOW!

This was really good, without being spicy hot, which I found very refreshing as I usually can't do Spanish or Mexican dishes because they tend to be too spicy. Hence, the reason I gave it a 5 star Rating.

Made this pretty much the same turned out excellent, ate a quarter of it plain the way it came out of the pan was really good, like my food a little hotter so ate the next half with a little hot sauce. This is a easy and quick recipe that I will definitely be making again and again. Thanks for this recipe, and thank-you everyone for your reviews I always read them and adjust.

I served this to my husband, son and grandson, and all give it five stars!  I used half as many potatoes and 6 eggs, but otherwise prepared as written.  If I was going to add anything, I would saute' bacon to begin with,  use the remaining drippings to fry the potatoes and crumble the bacon for garnish with green onions and tomatoes.

It came out delicious, I used two frying pans so I have less amounts  of potatoes in each one, once they browned and the onion got softer I mixed them up and pour the eggs, instead of another plate  I use the other frying pan which I kept it in low heat and brushed my coconut oil that I used fr the whole process. Then once the egg at bottom were browned on the other pan, I cover it with the other pan and flipped it and let  the eggs on top to continue cooking for 3 min until light brown meanwhile I set my  tomatoes and garnish with parsley.  I enjoy  your recipe and experimenting  the transfer of my omelette.

I used red pepper instead of tomatoes, and put them in a few minutes after the onions. I was worried that the omelet would burn before cooking through enough to flip over but it was totally fine! Turned out great!

After the potatoes and onions were done, I simply turned off the heat, added the eggs and left everything to sit and absorb flavours for 20 minutes. No need to dirty up another bowl. I also added a few Brussels sprouts cut into quarters, then near the end of cooking, grated a bit of cheese on top and garnished it with chopped parsley. This recipe is also a great way of using leftover potatoes from last night's dinner.
