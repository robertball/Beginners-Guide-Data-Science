This recipe is absolutely delicious. My husband and I both loved it. It's very easy to make. I have given the recipe to several other people and everyone that has made it liked it too. I will definitely be making it again.

If you are a sauerkraut fan, like we are, you will enjoy this recipe.  I followed it exactly and thought it was a nice twist on baked beans.  It is a little sweeter than typical baked beans but enjoyable and simple to make.

Sorry, but this just did not do it for me. It was almost too sweet and there wasn't much flavor from the kraut. I thought it sounded good and I liked all the ingredients but I wouldn't make it again.

Way too sweet! I tied cutting the apple sauce down and adding warchestershire and less brown sugar. But between the texture and the sweetness this recipe was not for us.

I loved these! They are a bit sweet, but just leave a bit of the brown sugar out if you don't like it and be on your way! Super easy and soooo much flavor!
