This recipe was a hit when I made it for my super-picky roommates! I did stir in 1/2 of the stuffing into the condensed soup mixture and sprinkled the other 1/2 over the top. Also, I put the casserole under the broiler for the last couple minutes because I love crunchy stuffing (YUM!).  I thought that gave it a nice texture that complemented the creaminess of the condensed soups and tender chicken. This recipe would be a wonderful way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.

This recipe was okay. It is very easy to make, with little prep time and ingredients most people have on hand.  I used canned chicken to make it even easier!  This would be a good recipe for a busy school night, but definetly not one for company!

don't bother preparing the stuffing ahead of time, just sprinkle it right out of the bag onto the meat/soup mixture before baking. crunchy!

i use cream of shroom soup instead of celery, and a whole bag of frozen peas/carrots for the veggies. easy AND delicious!

love this recipe!

My boyfriend ate seconds of this which was a surprise, since he doesn't usually like anything with the taste of celery. Easy to make!

I make this for my family with a few alterations making it a Veggie casserole with GREAT results.  

I add a bag of frozen broccoli/cauliflower/carrots, one or two chopped left-over veggie chick'n patties & using biscuits on top.  

Add the frozen veggies in the beginning along with the veggie patties instead of chicken flesh.  After cooking for the initial 25 minutes called for in this recipe, cut the refrigerated (or homemade) biscuits into quarters & place them so they cover the top of the casserole.  Bake again until the biscuits are browned.

It's not the healthiest of meals, but it's EASY & a sure crowd pleaser around here!  My finicky 15yr old daughter HATES broccoli, but devours it in this casserole.

This recipe looked good on paper, but it was so bland.  It's not one I will make again.

It was really easy to make and even my picky daughter who hates stuffing had seconds. We made it in the summer but I see it being a great add to the menu on a nice cold autumn day.

A good preview for Thanksgiving with this dish but it needed SALT and GRAVY. While moist, it just screams for the wet of some good gravy.

Easy recipe to feed a family after a long day at work. I didn't have a problem with being bland. And like others say no need to make the stuffing mix, I just dumped 2 boxes in.

My family loves this meal and It's quick and easy, which is my favorite type of dinner on a busy night. I use can chicken so I don't have to precook the chicken. It's good reheated so I make extra for my husband to take to work the next day.

I made this with 2 cans of Cream of Potato, corn, carrots, peas, celery & onions. When mixing everything together I add half a can of chicken gravy along with the milk. It adds much flavour. I add seasonings to my chicken as well. The stuffing on top is amazing as well. My family and I just love this meal!
