I think there might be a few typo errors in this recipe. First of all 4 tbs EVOO is way too much. I had to drain the skillet of the EVOO  in order for the sausage to brown. The sauce did not reduce after adding the white wine. I followed it as written and added the water and the tomatoes. The recipe never states what to do with the Romano cheese so I went ahead and added it to the skillet. After 10 minutes of simmering it and still having a soup consistency I added 2 oz of cream cheese to thicken it. The flavors were very acidic due to the tomatoes so I added a tbs of sugar, salt and black pepper to taste. It ended up pretty good and this could be a 5 star recipe with these modifications.

We liked this rag√π very much and we're not big sausage eaters. Instead of using plain water, I just used some of the pasta water to help with flavor. Imake Barilla GF pasta for  all my family members (even non celiacs) and we are all so pleased with the taste and texture. Thank you for the recipe.

Verrry, good! Although it looked a little plain to me, I followed the recipe exactly but, alas, cheated in the end by adding a half a dozen sliced white mushrooms pan fried in butter. I know you purists will be shaking your finger at me for rating a recipe I changed, but I think this addition tops off an excellent recipe nicely.
