A very tasty salad. I LOVE persian food and I love lentils, so I was excited to try this combo. I went with NOOSH's suggestion to add fresh mint. I wasn't sure how much to add so at first I minced about 7-8 mint leaves. It gave just a slight hint of flavor (barely noticeable), so I added another 7-8 leaves and it was perfect!   I highly recommend this addition. It gives the salad such a fresh flavor.  I have a hard time getting hubby to eat any sort of salad, and  with his first bite he said WOW, this is really good!  The only change I made was to use way less red onion than called for. I ended up using about 1/4 onion, since most red onions are huge. Thanks for the recipe NOOSH!

Excellent!  I have to admit to a couple of changes due to dietary requirements.  I did not use canned lentils..I cooked my own to the tenderness I prefer and I used scallions instead of red onions.  
This is a perfect summer salad..great for picnics and suitable for a vegan or gluten free diet..I will make this again and again.. maybe trying different salad dressings each time..  I'm a bit adventuresome..

Excellent use of fresh cucumbers from my garden. Next time, I might add garbanzo beans and some kalamata olives to it for a little more flair. Nice summer salad. Thanks!

I wanted an easy recipe to use lentils in. Trying to eat more plant based foods and new to it. I didn't have the exact ingredients, but I used dried green lentils that I cooked, a white onion instead of red, lemon instead of lime, a handful of cherry tomatoes, no olive oil (trying to cut back), but added rice vinegar to the apple cider vinegar, avocado, and parsley. Was very refreshing!

I've never been a big fan of lentils, but in heart of being healthier, am looking for healthier ideas. This recipe was very good. I used dry green lentil cooked to package specifications and I think I made too much but adjusted the ingredients to compensate. I added much more seasoning than listed (that is, tarragon, mint, and other Mediterranean spices) and also added seasoned rice wine vinegar in addition to the apple cider vinegar.
I would make this salad frequently! Even my husband, who likes lentils less than I, liked this salad.
I believe this recipe could be tweaked to any taste. I highly recommend trying this recipe, even if you don't think you like lentils. Like me, you might be surprised. :)

Loved this! Made as directed except I couldn't find canned lentils, had to make them. My husband loved the flavor but didn't like the texture. 5 stars from me!

Wonderful taste! I added a bit of cilantro and also used dried beans instead of canned. I will be making this again.

Would absolutely make this again.  The lime was a great addition. I used this to use up some of our CSA booty, including fresh tomatoes, parsley and cucumbers.  We also added feta and olives to kick up the salt.

Nice salad as written. Then I deviated to try dried mint, mixing in 2 teaspoons while whisking the dressing together. It does add a cool bit of refreshment but beckoned me to go back to heavy hand the cucumber. 2 teaspoons dried mint, if adding, would be the minimum in my opinion.

I have made this twice now and love it.  It is quick & easy to make, nutritious and tasty.  No cooking required for those hot summer days.  So far I have stuck to the recipie, but have not tried it with mint in it.   I will definitely make this again!

This is delicious! I have made it several times. It's so light and fresh tasting, yet filling because of the lentils. Reminds me of fattoush salad, which is probably why it's so good with toasted pita.

This was really good.  I drained off the excess dressing before I served it and added finely chopped mint (like other reviewers had suggested).  The mint was a great additional and I will include it again.

I didn't have any mint available and ended up using cilantro, it still turned out amazing.
