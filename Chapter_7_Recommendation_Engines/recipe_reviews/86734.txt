I thought this sounded at little salty, so I added an 8 oz. pkg. of low fat cream cheese, I also added a little extra salsa to make up for it. It was delicious.  The guests at my son's college grad party raved!

Spicy!  I scaled this recipe back to 6 servings for after school snack.  Used 1/4 lb. gound sage sausage and 1/4 lb. fresh country mild sausage from the local butcher.  To tame the spiciness, I added 4 tablespoons of cream cheese.  Served with tortilla chips.

I made this for work and doubled the recipe.  The crock pot was empty by noon.   Everyone loved it and wanted my recipe.  I did take another poster's advice and used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the mushrooms.  I will definetly keep this recipe and use it often as it is quick and delicious.

I've been making this for more than 20 years now. Folks are disappointed if I show up at a party without it. I use ground beef or turkey seasoned with a great chili powder from Savory. I also add a can of refried beans and extra chilies if I have them.

Always a hit at parties.  I love the mushrooms in this.  I have changed this up quite often by adding mexican Velveeta cheese to give it a little more kick and ground beef instead of sausage.

We loved it. I just changed a few things. I did NOT put in the mushrooms, we hate those things. Also i made the mistake by using breakfast sausage, i think a spicy sausage would have been better. But still it was Very Yummy!!! it was a little salty, but i think we used too salty of chips. so keep that in mind too.

Ths recipe is great.  Instead of 16 oz of Velveeta, Try it with 1/2 velveeta (8oz) and 1/2 cream cheese (8oz).  Takes it to the next level.  Really good!

Try this recipe with 1 lb. of 4% hamburger and when hamburger is done mix a 1/4 package of Old El Paso Taco Seasoning 40% less sodium, Thick and Chunky Sslsa, and mexican Velveeta. I am always asked to make for parties and I never have any left over!

Wow this is good!!  You can add a few jalepenos to make it spicier but it's mild as is.

I absolutely love this recipe. Made it originally as a small appetizer for Christmas and have made it three more times since.  Very easy to make and easy to find ingredients, just perfect for a potluck.  Please use a good cheese, I use the store brand once, and it was the same.

I have made this for years, but I usually use hamburger instead of sausage. The only other think I do is fry 1/2 finely chopped onion with my meat.
