I put a review on this way back in 99 or 2000 and I have to say 7 or 8 years later, this is still a champion! I'll be forever grateful for this recipe. I thought the original poster would like to know how this recipe and her willingness to share it has become a family tradition in another person's home. 

My mother made something called 'Yam Puff' for years. Early in my marriage I could not find that favorite recipe and tried this one. This one was even better and I've now made it for 8 or 9 years straight. Thanks again!

Thank you to all the wonderful people here who share their best-loved recipes.:-D

The hit of every Thanksgiving dinner I bring it to!  I actually use yams from a can and it works just fine.  Just drain most of the syrup before beating.  
This one will go in my Thanksgiving lineup for years to come!

I omitted the eggs and butter from the yam mixture and used orange juice instead to make it a little more healthy (and add a little extra citrus kick). It was really great this way, not heavy at all. I did however use the 1/4 melted butter for the topping. It was really tasty and I will surely make it again.

I have never made anything with yams or would not have even claimed to be a fan of yams in the past, but this recipe was delicious! A couple things I did differently: I peeled and cut the yams into medium pieces, put them in a microwave-safe bowl, added 1/2 cup water and microwaved them, covered, for 12 minutes. This made it much easier. Also, I halved this recipe. It was more than enough for 6 people. Another thing I did different, was I chopped the nuts and mixed them up with the butter and brown sugar and then sprinkled that mixture on top of the mashed yams. This casserole had just the right amount of sugar and spices. It was perfect! My two kids (4&3) loved it, too, which was nice for me! I think I might try adding a little orange juice next time I make it and see how that is. Thanks Liza!

Five Stars?  YOU BET!  This was fantastic.  Readers:  you are going to get tired of reading people saying, "I don't even like sweet potatoes/yams, but I LOVED this!"  Because it's TRUE!  I've never seen my mom eat yams and she ate more helpings than anyone else.  This is an absolute keeper.  Wonderful recipe, thanks so much!

Yam haters all agree!  This is the bomb! Very easy to make and I love the ability to prepare earlier and freeze.  A time saver and a delicious side dish.

I served this today to 12.  It's tough to make a sweet potato casserole that doesn't "have legs", but I really like this one, and it went fast.  It's a perfect combination of spices, easy to prepare, and you can easily cut the sugar and butter by a third and still have great results.  I was very pleased with my guests' reaction.  Thanks LL.

I've made this for 2 holiday dinners and got tons of compliments. My mother says "it tastes just like pumpin pie" I AGREE! It's excellent. Excellent flavor and this is a guiltless pleasure. I can't wait to make it again. Not good with ham..too many sweets! Better to accompany a saltier dinner.

Excellent recipe! I've been making this for Thanksgiving for the past couple of years and it receives rave reviews every time! We have kids in our family from 15 months to 15 years old and this is enjoyed by all.

I can't help but notice that mostly everyone on this site uses yams and sweet potatoes interchangeably.  They are actually not the same thing.  I'm so happy to have found this recipe, because everytime I do a search for yams, it turns out that it calls for sweet potatoes.  Thank you for getting it right.  I find yams to have more flavor then sweet potatoes.  I love yams, but usually casseroles are bland.  This one did a lot better for me, and everyone asked me for the recipe.  This is definitely a keeper for the holidays.  Personally I'd give it a 4 and would probably rate that for anything using sweet potatoes and yams, but everyone else raved about it, so I'm going to give it a 5.  I'm a tough critic :)

This is a good receipe. I only changed a couple of things. I used (2) large cans of Sweet Potatoes,no one noticed. THey were actually surprised when I told them. I also chopped the pecans,instead of leaving them whole on top.

I have never, ever in my three decades on Earth liked sweet potatoes or yams, nor did four of my dinner mates.  My husband adores candied yams with marshmallows.  This recipe worked for us all.  I used sweet potatoes (wrapped in foil and baked at 350 for 1-1/2 hours) and added marshmallows to half of the casserole (over the pecans), but otherwise did everything else as written.  It was wonderful!  The flavor was full and well rounded.  The spices and butter melded perfectly and brought out the best part of the sweet potato flavor.  I am saving this and will make it throughout the year.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Every Thanksgiving people ask me to make this. It's easy and a huge hit. I've fiddled with it a bit over the years with less sugar, no nuts, maple syrup etc and it's always good.

I rated this years ago and I feel the need to rate it again!  It's by far my favorite side dish at Thanksgiving.  I peel and boil the potatoes, then mash them.  Apparently I have to try it with marshmallows this year because we have someone coming with a nut allergy.  I happen to prefer it with the nuts so I'm making two batches.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

I made a bunch of things on Thanksgiving and this was my favorite.  I made it the day before which saved time/energy the day of. And, the leftovers are just as yummy, too!

This was very good.  I must admit, I used some frozen sweet potatoes instead of fresh yams.  Regardless, it was wonderful!  My brother remarked that it tasted more like a dessert than a side, but it wasn't too rich or sweet.  I bet if I put this in a pie crust, people would eat it like a pumpkin pie.  I might have to try that sometime.

This is a quick and easy sweet potato casserole, especially light on cleanup, as you microwave the sweet potatoes to begin with.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this very much as a Thanksgiving side dish:  we all felt it tasted like pumpkin pie!

Very good and so easy to make!  I don't like yams either but the hubby does.  I usually open a can and heat it up.  I thought this Thanksgiving would be different.  NO CANS!  Along with Cranberry Sauce I (from this site) everything was delicious!  I even ate some myself.

This recipe is very close to one I make every year and I plan to make it ahead and freeze. There are not to many comments from folks who made the casserole ahead and froze it. Are there any problems there? Drynes? Defrosting and reheating should be included in the main recipe! I had to search the Thanksgiving menu for these instructions. I am  searching for THE BEST make ahead recipes so I can enjoy my 20 Thanks giving guests who return year after year.

DO NOT PASS UP THIS RECIPE!! This recipe is exactly how people rate it, just wonderful! I put a little extra nuts though cuz I love the crunchiness constrasting with the smoothness of the yams. Just be careful when u take them out of the microwave-they're hot!

I am not a yam lover - I actually hate them! I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I cannot have another thanksgiving without serving this dish. It is the most delicious dish I've ever had and this is the ONLY way I will ever eat yams. Thank you to Liza for submitting such a wonderful recipe.

Very good. I don't usually make anything with sweet potatoes (easily confused with yams in the U.S.) but was given several and decided to search for a good recipe. I saw the reviews for this one and made it-I like it. I also like that it can be frozen.

I have made this for Thanksgiving for the past several years for my family. Everyone in my family LOVES this dish, including the picky eaters! We were never big yam/sweet potato fans before this, but now everyone requests that this dish be served every Thanksgiving- this recipe will be included in our family cookbook! The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I use canned yams, because its a time saver. Other than that, this recipe is perfect!

This recipe is simple to make and tastes fantastic, I will make this again. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing. I didn't have nutmeg or allspice so I used 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and it worked great.

This is one of the standards for Thanksgiving in my family. The ONLY thing I do different is put marshmallows on the top instead of the pecan topping. But I am thinking this year I may put those marshmallows on top of the pecans.

This is a great recipe but just to sweet. Made this twice and just keep backing off the white sugar. 1/2 cp is plenty.

Absolutely delicious!! My entire family of non-yam eaters raved over it and all wanted the leftovers to take home. I crushed the pecans in the food processor to get a crunchy texture in every bite, and I also peeled, then boiled the yams to avoid the microwave mishaps. Everyone thought it tasted like pumpkin pie!

I was really nervous about making this. At first I thought I bought the wrong veg...but it came out fantastic! I didn't change a thing. Made the yams the night before and added the topping right before putting in the oven and it came out beautifully.  Delicious and I will be making again and again. Thank you so much.  This was my first Thanksgiving Dinner at my house and everything came out wonderfully, including this. God bless!

I have made this several times, but the only thing I change is I don't mash the Yams, I slice them length ways and layer them in a dish. Like first layer yams brown sugar dot with butter and I also mix the spices together and spinkle on each layer. Actully I have three layers cook for about 35 mins at 300 Degs. then put marshmellowa on top and put inoven for about maybe 5 mins. until top in brown.

Very good!  I used canned yams to save time, and it still turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS!  My family scarfed it up.  It officially retired our "old" sweet potato dish.  This is the first time making it, so I followed the recipe with two minor changes:  Baked the yams in the oven (I had a microwave yam explosion once, it wasn't pretty!) and I already had walnuts on hand, so used those instead of pecans.  Yummy is the perfect description!

I tried to make this in the microwave and that is when things went terribly wrong for me.  After cleaning up the horrible mess I made trying that I cooked the yams the old fashioned way and then followed the rest of the directions how they are written.  What made that mishap worth it was how everyone loved the dish, even those who hate yams.  My nephew hates most everything but had seconds of this and then asked for more.  Yummy! :)

Delicious!  The flavours blend so nicely in this dish.  I did not have enough yams and added some butterbut squash which tased great too.  I crushed the pecans for the top because I only had peices but next time I will use the full halves.

I added this recipe to our holiday dinner at the last minute.  Hubby had picked up canned yams instead of fresh, so I used them in place of the baked yams.  The results were wonderful.  Can't wait to try it with baked yams. We all loved it, thanks!

I just finished reading an article on sweet potatoes (light or dark) and yams (brown/black, not really sold in the US), which are not the same thing. Just google sweet potatoes and do a little reading. Anyways, this is an awesome recipe my family enjoyed it when made with the New Jersey variety. However, they said they would have prefered the pecans chopped, not halved.

Every year I usually try to make something new for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  With all of the wonderful reviews I read about this yam casserole recipe, I chose this one.  

I was a little dissapointed though.  If there is something odd about a new recipe, I would usually make my own slight changes to it.  But with this one, I didn't want to do that at all because I don't eat yams (not because I don't like them, but because I never had the erge to try them).  

Making it was easy.  I made sure all my measurements were correct, the potatoes were soft enough, and I even went out and bought a 3 quart casserole dish, because I didn't have one.  

The filling did not come out sweet at all.  In some of the reviews, I read that this can be considered a dessert.  But it really wasn't sweet enough.  I'm not saying that it  tasted horrible, but I expected a little bit more out of the recipe.  

I rated this recipe 3 stars because only 2 people out of 10 at my dinner party liked it.  Those 2 people ended up eating the whole thing.  Sorry, but I will not be making this for Christmas or any time in the future.

Wow Excellent. Family members who have always "hated" sweet potatoes went back for seconds. I even heard the comment do we have to wait for Christmas to have it again?
Thank you for sharing what will become  a family classic

I've been a member since 2006 and make this time and again.  My whole family and guests always LOVE this.  My 13 year old and I actually get cravings and will make this just for that.  He raves that its "just like pumpkin pie"  I LOVE it with stuffing ie...sweet and salty ;)

I thought this was delicious and I don't consider myself much of a yam lover. I baked this for a thanksgiving feast at the school I work at. I chose this recipe because it looked easy and it was. I have only made 2 or 3 recipes from scratch. (I'm only 22) Everyone just loved this dish and several of my student's parents have asked for the recipe. I plan to make it again this Thanksgiving and every Thanksgiving from now on! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

very good recipe, sweet & rich. (was my first attempt at a sweet potato/yam casserole, glad it turned out so well!) i did about half the recipe, using 4 smallish sweet potatoes and an 8x8 pyrex dish. peeling the microwaved sweet potatoes was a bit tricky for me, parts of the skin didn't want to come off, next time i might try peeling, cubing and boiling them instead! could have used a few more potatoes to fill up the dish, but i made plenty of topping, and the combo is delicious! i chopped the pecans and mixed them with the brown sugar, placed on top, then drizzled with butter. i added a splash of vanilla to the potato mixture, and left out the nutmeg and allspice, but it still was great! thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I used 2 cans of canned yams, since that is all I had on hand. So I halved the recipe, there was still more than enough for our family of four.  By the way, my kids, who won't eat Yams, or Sweet Potatoes, LOVED THIS!  My 12 year old went back for thirds!  I actually told them it was pumpkin pie without the crust, so they would try it!  It worked! The amounts are perfect, I wouldn't change it one bit! I forgot to add that I also chopped the pecans (chunky, not fine) and blended them with the brown sugar, then sprinkled on top and drizzled the melted butter over that.

Made this casserole just the way it is written and loved the yam part.  Lovely texture and not too sweet.  Would try to do something to the topping as others have suggested next time.

I didn't follow the recipe to the T. I actually used the yams from a can (2 lbs). Will say this, with the can, you don't need to cook it however, you do need to drain all the syrup out! I let a little bit stay in and it made my whole dish a little runny. But the taste was still great!

this casserole tasted pretty good but i thought it's texture was a bit dry. i made the yams part as directed then froze it for a week to serve at thanksgiving. maybe that had something to do with the dryness? i also placed a few minature marshmellows over the topping before baking. thanks liza.

The best ever!!  I usually make 2 batches for Thanksgiving, one with pecans painstakingly shaped into a turkey on top and one topped with marshmellows. The one with the marshmellows always go fast and the pecan one barely gets touched, this year, I am making 2 batches with the marshmellows on top.

This turned out wonderful - exactly what I expected! It was sweet, but no sweeter than the candied yams my grandma makes every year.  My mom and I even ate the leftovers for breakfast with coffee!  Will be making this again!

This is a very sweet dish.  Everyone at thanksgiving agreed that it was more of a dessert than a side dish.  I may use this recipe for the filling of a sweet potato pie.

I made this today for Thanksgiving!  It was absolutely scrumptious.  It did indeed taste a little like pumpkin pie.  The nuts on top were a very nice touch.  The ingredients are very well balanced in this recipe and make for a wonderful variation of the traditional candied yams.  It was sweet but not too sweet.  It was definitely the hit of the party today!

Excellent. I had been looking for a dish like mom's "yam puff" and had tried many things. Well she is here this year, but couldn't find her recipe and I found this. It is BETTER than mom's yam puff!!! Great recipe. I think this will be a holiday treat for many years to come. BTW, my 4 yr old would never try yams before, but she kept taking small bites of this and saying it tasted like pumpkin pie;-)

This is similar to my grandmother's recipe. I always add a layer of miniature marshmallows on top of the sweet potato mixture, then mix the butter, brown sugar, etc together for the topping and drizzle it across the top of the marshmallows. Family favorite for three generations!

I loved this. Didn't change a thing. I love that you can make it the day ahead, without the toppings and then just add them and pop it in the oven while the turkey is resting. I've also frozen it uncooked without toppings a week ahead of time, thawed it in the fridge, and then done the same thing. It's a great recipe. It looks really pretty too! My family gave it great reviews!

I liked this, but made about 2x the topping because that was the best part. It's sort of an intermediate between savoury and dessert, which I find odd, but on the whole pretty good.

I made this for my husband specifically for Thanksgiving.  I was looking for a grown up "candied yam" recipe that my family would enjoy.  I am not a fan of sweet potatoes or yams, and I did not expect to like this.  It was actually my favorite dish on Thanksgiving.  It is going to be a Thanksgiving staple from now on.  I used a food processor to "mash" the sweet potatoes.  And I used Mrs Dash, instead of salt.  :)

If you're looking for a yam recipe... You can stop now because you found it! Everyone loved this when I made this last year for a family dinner... Even me and I don't like yams. My mother insisted we add yams to the menu so I obliged and went searching for a recipe and found this one. Thank you for sharing this and thank God I found it again (forgot to tag it) will be adding it to the Thanksgiving menu this year!

I never liked yams--wouldn't touch'em with a ten foot pole.  Several years ago, I was asked to bring a side dish for Thankgiving and my usual dishes were already "taken" by other cooks.  So I read these reviews and decided to give it a try.  This is soooooo good I could not believe it. My dad who shared my dislike of yams tried and loved it as well. This recipe has become a part of our holiday "regulars" since.

This is my 2nd year making this and this is the only way my family will eat yams. I do make one change - I am allergic to nutmeg and pecans so basically use just cinnamon for the spice. Delicious!

This recipe was delicious, you do not need a blender if you have a strong mixing arm.  I froze half of it and am looking forward to another dish.  I do not like how much butter it calls for but it tastes so good.

I've finally found a yam recipe for Thanksgiving that isn't just a placeholder, like my old baked yams with marshmallows. This casserole was a favorite of all yam eaters this last year, and rated the best ever yam casserole by several attendees.  I loved it and will make it again.

Light, tasty, colorful, great mix of textures -- perfect side dish for Thanksgiving. Some of my guests that could not eat pumpkin pie for dessert (due to wheat allergies) ate this instead!  It's that good!

It was very good. I would like it a little creamier next time. I think I am going to add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 can of evaporated milk.

I made this in advance (by about three weeks and froze it) for our Thanksgiving and had NO leftovers. The finished casserole was just as it looked in the pic.  My brother and sister who were in from out of state asked for the recipe and luckily, I had printed two copies.  They couldn't believe that their sister made this - SURPRISE!  Thanks for making our holiday tastier and more memorable.

I thought it was a good basic recipe, but make sure to whip the mixture until it is very light and fluffy otherwise it will turn into a brick.  I also think I will add crushed pecans and more brown sugar and butter to the top so as to make it crunchier and sweeter.

This is more like a dessert rather than a side dish, especially with the pecans, felt like I was eating pie.  If you prefer simpler yams, this may not be the right dish for you. People ate it and liked it, but still PLENTY of leftovers afterwards. Overall an OK dish.

My review must be taken with a grain of salt as I am not a yam fan. However being a traditional dish at Thanksgiving I thought I'd try my hand at it. While this recipe was very easy to make, I felt the allspice was overpowering in the final dish.

this had too much cinammon, nutmeg, allspice flavor to it.  Not a keeper at my house.

This recipe is excellent and loved by everyone (even my kids who usually wouldn't touch anything like yams!)!  I have even someone offer to pay me to make this for them!  It's great for sharing at potluck suppers or for a holiday feast!  Enjoy!!

This was great. It does taste a bit like pumpkin pie. The Pecans make it really tasty.

I made this for Thanksgiving a few weeks ago.  I followed the recipe exactly, except have a sister who doesn't do dairy, so subbed margarine for the butter.  Everyone that tried it commented on how good it was...multiple times!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!

This is one of the best dishes we have had for Thanksgiving EVER!!!  It was so very easy to make and it was gone within seconds.  Last year was the first time we have ever had left over mashed potatoes.  Everyone absolutely loved this side dish.  I'm glad I was able to come back to this site and find the recipe again for this year. I highly recommend it especially for the holidays.

I followed the recipe exactly. First time I've ever made yams. I would be tempted to add more pecans next time, just because I love pecans. This dish was awesome. I didn't even cook it for thanksgiving... I made it since yams are so good for you. This was almost like a dessert, like a pumpkin pie filling, but not quite that sweet. Not quite as good the second day, but awesome right out of the oven! Everyone loved it!

I think this is an excellent recipe but it felt like it was missing something. I am going to make it again because it was delicious but I am going to add apples and because I like my yams candied, a few marshmallows.

This was not very well liked by my guests.  The yams were too difficult to cook in the microwave, and I ended up with chunks of yams in my casserole that did not mash well.

Wonderful. This fluffy, flavorful recipe reminds me of the whipped yams at a very famous deli in Hollywood. I made this recipe for thanksgiving & it was a hit. I am not an experienced cook, but even I was successful with this recipe.

Since I used canned yams, I skipped Step 2.  This recipe is good if you want a sweet sensation during the meal instead of just at dessert.

It was easy enough and amazing as others have said. It was wonderful because it was not too sweet like candied yams. most everyone didn't think any sugar was added which is a plus for this group.

It turned out fantastic because I accidentally only used half the amount of yams. Even the non-yam lovers raved about it.
I chopped the pecans and toasted in butter before adding.

This is a keeper.  Next time I won't use quite as many pecans, probably 4 oz.  I also didn't whip the yams for a long time, just enough to mix them.  I may try them in chunks next time.  The brown sugar and butter caramelize the pecans on top  and they make this casserole yummy.  I simply put this in my 325 degree oven by the turkey for about 45 minutes and it came out great.

Absolutely a hit at our pre thanksgiving dinner. Like the Lizalouise said- it is the recipe with legs  as I have to foward this recipe to two of my dinner guests. One thing I did add to the recipe were mini marshmellows on top. Delicious!!!

I made it, and it was delicious!  I didn't change a thing.  I already have a request for this recipe from one of those who joined us for Thanksgiving last year.

There's WAY too much sugar in this recipe. I doubt I'll make it again, even with less sugar.

I’m not a fan of yams or sweet potatoes but have made this for thanksgiving and Christmas and everyone raved about it. So, it’s a keeper, I guess!

This was delicious!  Instead of fresh sweet potatoes, I took the easy way out and used Bruce’s canned yams (2). In addition, I used 1/4 cup of sugar in the potatoes instead of 1/2.  Everyone loved them!  I will definitely make this again!

Thought I try something different from my usual candied yam dish. I gave this one a try and was not impressed! I think that this really needs a crumb topping to avoid cheweing on the brown sugar topping!

Made this recipe last year for Thanksgiving (and Christmas) and it was a hit even with people who don't normally like yams.  It is easy to prepare and store ahead of time but, more importantly, it tastes delicious.  My niece told me it was better than candy :)

I've been making this recipe for about ten years now and I still love it. The very first time I made it for a potluck, one of my friends from the deep south exclaimed that it was the best sweet potato pie he had ever had. He didn't even care that there wasn't a crust.

I have learned to taste the mixture before adding sugar as sometimes I don't need to full amount.

Yes, I am a yam fan and made it for Thanksgiving. Easy to make a day ahead. I cooked it without the pecans and refrigerated it overnight according to a helpful review. I  added the pecans the next day when I reheated the casserole and they caramelized.
Very yummy indeed!

This is super easy and super yummy.  I made some short cuts and adjustments. I wanted to make a double batch for Thanksgiving. I used three large cans of perpaered yams. I doubled all of the ingredients, BUT not the brown sugar. To make the  dish a little more health conscious I used 1 and 1/2 of the prown sugar and the same with the butter.  Noone even noticed the difference from when i made this last year as a single batch with the full meause of sugar and butter.   
It is delicious! either way.

Love, love this recipe.  This is always on the Thanksgiving menu.  I have made as written and loved it.  However, my kids don't like pecans.  So I make it with marshmallows instead.  I just omit the extra brown sugar and butter.  Personally I prefer the pecans but the kids win for now. I never have left overs

I added more cinnamon and about a cup of buttermilk and a cup of sugar to the yams. The mixture seemed to be a little dry for me and not sweet enough. I then put a layer of cream cheese filling on top of yams- one 8 ounce package of cream cheese melted, 1/4 cup of butter, one egg yolk, 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, and 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. For the topping I doubled the recipe because I like lots of pecans and added 1/4 cup of flour. Yum Yum!!

This tasted like pumpkin pie filling.  lol...  I topped half with mini marshmallows and the other half with the pecans.  I liked the pecan side better.  This was super yummy.

The recipe was delicious, but microwaving the yams was a pain. The yams cooked unevenly. Next time, I will peel the yams ahead of time and then boil them to cook them. I had to boil the ones that did not get cooked all of the way through!

The pecans are a really nice touch, and they add some crunch. I don't think it needs all that sugar, though - it's too sweet for me. Pile on the butter and it's all good.

You can just boil the yams on a stove if you have  microwave like me.

Fantastic, I made it for thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it.  I baked my yams instead of cooking them in the microwave, and I put the pecans through the food processor for a quick pulse instead of putting them on whole, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic.  Really, really good.

Made this for my 3 year old and my wife and I practically ate the whole thing ourselves. The only thing is that I skipped the pecans but it came out perfect.

Great recipe as written.  Even people who don't like yams or sweet potatoes love this, ask for more and ask for the recipe.  I have made it ahead of time (up to the point of adding the stuff to the top) and froze it until the day I needed it.  Then just allow to thaw, add the stuff to the top and bake.

Amazing compliment to my turkey dinner.  I wrapped the yams in tinfoil and popped them in the oven next to the turkey to bake, and took them out after about 1-1/2 hours.  Let them cool, then removed the skins, and prepped the casserole.  I used my electric mixer to whip them into a super creamy texture.  Once my turkey was cooked, I removed it from the oven and then put the casserole in to bake while I made my gravy and carved the bird.  The timing was perfect.

i doubled the recipe due to cooking for alot of people but it was ruined becuase of one thing , the all spice , whoever wrote this recipe down either miscopied or was drunk cuz the allspice just ruined the dinner way to over powering next time i'll use half what it calls for with the allspice , other than that i think it was good although i have to cook it again too get a better taste of this great dish

I make this every year for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.  It is so delicious and my family loves it!  I buy pecans in bulk and just use enough to cover the entire top of the casserole to make it look really pretty.

Amazing, this is the only Yam/Sweet Potato casserole I have ever liked.  Everyone in my family liked it so much they asked for the recipe.  I think if you put it in a crust you could call it pie.

Yummy Yam Casserole is right! Made it exactly as written and it was great, a great addition to our Thanksgiving table. On Sunday, this morning, I made pumpkin bread but used the left over casserole instead of pumpkin puree, that tasted great too.

Oh, so much better than the old standbys with miniature marshmallows.  I drained a big can of yams and beat with the electric mixer, then made as directed.   I made this the day before  without the topping, then added the pecans, brown sugar, and melted butter to the top and stuck it in the oven while the dressing baked.  It was perfect. I can't say my guests raved about it, since only two of us eat yams, but if you love yams or sweet potatoes, you should love this.

Yams just roasted in the oven with a bit of olive oil is wonderful, but this casserole dish is perfect for Thanksgiving! Everyone loves it... even those who do not like yams/sweet potatoes! It's a must at our Thanksgiving meal!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with most people. I, personally, found it a bit too sweet... even after taking 1/2 cup of sugar out.   But definitely a good veggie dish for non-veggie people.

I served Canadian Thanksgiving dinner in Sweden for my friends, and this was SUCH a good recipe. I added some maple syrup instead of some of the brown suger (to up the Canadian factor) and made it vegan (marg instead of butter and ground flax instead of eggs - 3tsp ground flax and 1 tbsp water = 1egg, cholestrol free and works in anything!) and I loved it!

I was soo looking forward to this recipe... but unfortunately it was not quite what I was looking for. It just didn't seem to have as much flavor as I had hoped, which surprised me because of all the spices. But, maybe it just wasn't enough of the flavors that I was looking for. There was also too much butter on top for my taste. It definitely wasn't a bad recipe... just not suited to my tastes.

Made just as described and it came out great.  I think next time I would halve the recipe, which would be easy enough to do, and that way would have to worry about less leftovers.  Yummy!!

As good as I've ever had. I like the top crust alot. I experimented switching it to broil on my ovens top rack for the final few minutes. Made for a nice crispy browned crust with the nuts well roasted.

Everybody loved this recipe. I had everyone ask if they could take some of it home for a snack later. I only used one egg and I added a bit more pecan and melted butter to the top of the dish because I like a little crunch in every bite.

I served this for Easter and everyone loved it.  I was able to get my youngest son (who eats about 6 items total) to try it without the topping and he asked for seconds! Yes, it does freeze well.  I defrosted mine in the frig for 2 days.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The taste was really good. I baked the yams instead of boiling them, and I omitted the topping. I also omitted the butter, it wasn't needed. Overall it's delicious, only four stars because the yams should be baked in my opinion.

I made this for Thanksgiving with my family and again for my in-laws. It was loved by all! Even my sister-in-law who said she doesn't like yams. I made her try it and she went back for seconds! I don't like to microwave the yams. It takes too long and I'm not patient enough to let them cool. I prefer to skin them, boil them and then mash them. But, however you choose, it still tastes great!

Not at all a keeper recipe.  I was grossly disappointed.  While I like "sweet" this was overpowering!  My suggestion to anyone making it is to not use the sugar or butter on top; just add pecans if you want them.  I most definitely will not make this recipe again as nearly all of it was left plus much was left on plates after a taste.  I will stick to my own Candied Yam recipe which has always been a big hit.  I was tempted to try something different this year and I am so sorry that I did.  I realize our individual tastes is a huge variable with any recipe, however.

This was the first time I had Thanksgiving at my house, and this dish was a big hit!  I used 2 cans of sweet potatoes and changed the spices to 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  Will definitely make this again!

Really great!  I made two huge batches for a preschool dinner and there was only a little leftover.  Even the kids tore into it.  I did spice it up a little and used double the spice that the recipe called for.  I also left out the nuts because I was afraid someone would be allergic.  This recipe is now one of my favorites!

This is absolutely THE BEST and between my family and friends I don't know how loves it better! No more of the old standby yams at Thanksgiving. Now everyone looks forward to the Yummy Yam Casserole and we can hardly wait for November.

Too mushy.  My family prefers something more hardy.  It reminded them of baby food.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was ok, but not great. I made three vegetable dishes. The other two are completely gone.  I have about 80% of this dish left over. I won't be making it again.

I think this was a really yummy dish.  I didn't really like how it seemed to be on the thin side. And it really makes a lot. Next time I will half the recipe. All in all ,it was pretty good.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  I've tried other recipes like this, and did enjoy them, but they were almost more like desserts.  This was much better as a side dish. Thank you.

Didn't have any pecans, but was still a very good side-dish to our Christmas dinner.  Not overly sweet, but with plenty of good flavor.

Very very good. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that there are other recipes equally good. A very nice addition to turkey dinner.

I'm not nearly as sold on this recipe as other reviewers. For one, sweet potatoes are much more interesting when you can bite into them, as in a traditional holiday recipe, not as a puree.  And proportionally the pecans are add little to the dish.  I would not make this recipe to impress guests.

Unbelivable!  I hate yams and ate a full serving!  Very simple to make.  I omitted the nuts.
