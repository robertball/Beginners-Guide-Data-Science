There is kiwi in this recipe because it makes the chicken soft instead of chewy. It's just something a friend of mine taught me.

I enjoyed this meal very much. The chicken mix is delicious. I based the entire exterior of the bread bowl with a little butter for taste.

Flavor is good other than being too salty.  I found the bread bowl to be a lot of work.  Next time I think I would roll out dough and fill like a calzone.
