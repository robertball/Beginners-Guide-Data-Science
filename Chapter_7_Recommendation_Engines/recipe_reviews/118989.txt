These were absolutely wonderful, and the ease in making them warrants the 5 star rating. They had a cake like taste. I used a generic store brand waffle and pancake mix. Just a note - no need to measure 14T of sugar. I just measured the 3/4 cup and sprinkled sugar on the tops of the muffins prior to baking (which would be 2T if you're measuring - but I just sprinkled). I did coat the blueberries with the 2nd cup of dry mix because I've always read that this makes them mix in easier & not go to the bottom. I also didn't bother with the separate bowls for wet & dry ingredients. Just mix the eggs with the sour cream, add the dry ingredients & berries. I believe in keeping it simple - and this recipe does it, without sacrificing taste!

I recently bought baking mix for the first time in my life for a recipe I've since lost interest in trying. This recipe answered the question of what to do with it. I think I had these muffins in the oven this morning in about the same time it took me to wash my face and brush my teeth! Because I'm not familiar with baking mix and wondered if it might have any "pre-packaged" taste to it, I tried to circumvent that by adding a few shavings of lemon zest with my Microplane zester.  I also upped the sugar a little, using an easy-to-measure one full cup in the batter, then sprinkling them with demerara (turbinado or raw) sugar.  I baked them in mini-muffin tins about 14 minutes.  Cute, really chock full of plump blueberries, and too easy to continue popping into your mouth because of their size and because they taste so good- the perfect bite. Pleasantly sweet, light and fluffy, and I'm lovin' the addition of the lemon zest. This will also be a good, versatile recipe to refer to and use over and over again with any number of possible variations - other fruits or spices, or reduce or eliminate the sugar and make a savory muffin by adding herbs, Parmesan or shredded cheese, even vegetables. Or, because these are so good,  just keep making them as is.

Yum!  Simple and tasty muffins. Love that there are only 5 ingredients -  Quick to make.  Not too sweet.  Only change I will make next time will be to add more blueberries.

As a new baker, I found this recipe very easy to follow! I only made a couple of modifications... I added only 1/4 sour cream and 3/4 low fat vanilla yogurt and about a tblsp of milk, b/c batter seemed a bit dry. YUM! Very moist, a little bit sweeter and all around tastey!

Easy and delicious. I added a dash of cinnamon and some vanilla extract to the recipe and baked them in mini muffin cups. Yum!

I made these in mini muffin cups, and they were the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  I also used the same recipe with blackberries, and it tasted just like cobbler.  Make sure you grease the top of the muffin tin.  I tend to overfill the cups, and when they puffed up, I had a hard time releasing them from the pan.  I love how easy it is to make these.  Since there's less ingredients, they can be whipped up at a moment's notice.

The whole family loved these!  You can't tell that they are made with bisquick at all so I wouldn't waste the time using more ingredients to make muffins from scratch.  I wasn't sure how they would turn out because I only had fat free sour cream in the house, but the texture and taste was perfect and I saved on all that saturated fat too!

THese were sooooo good! I subbed buttermilk in place of the sour cream, and I halved the recipe just to try it...but I think they would be just as good w/ the sour cream. Excellent, my new blueberry muffin recipe!

Easy and moist but bland even with the sugar on top. A not too sweet muffins so if that is what you are looking for this might work for you. I'd prefer a recipe that incorporates some sugar in the mix - white or brown or both, maybe vanilla and/or cinnamon, or a dash of some citrus for zip - lemon zest maybe. I also found the mix to be pretty thick almost like it needed some milk to thin it out a bit. Had to really mix it to get the dry ingredients incorporated.

We thought these were pretty tasteless. Very moist tho & so easy! I'd up the sugar & probably add lemon zest if I were to make these again.

I was skeptical with so few ingredients, I used full fat sour cream for richness, and wow.  Very good - sooooo easy, loved it.

One of my neighbors gave me several pints of blueberries from New Jersey last spring that their church was selling for a fundraiser. I had just enough left in the freezer to make these but didn't have enough sour cream. Improvised with buttermilk and must say this was one of the best blueberry muffins I've ever had.  Super easy, just the right amount of sweetness and a recipe I look forward to doing again!

This are delicious and easy to prepare (I used the easy biscuit mixture recipe submitted by Janet).  I added more blueberries than called for since I wanted to use up the bag of frozen berries I had.  Turned out great.  A++++++++

Three stars because it's an easy recipe, but not a lot of taste here. I'm still looking for a good blueberry muffin recipe.

I used my own homemade baking mix (whole wheat white, baking powder, baking soda, salt),  I used organic eggs, and I also subbed fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream. These came out nicely, though they seem to be missing something. I'd like to play with the recipe and see if I can't figure it out. These came out very moist and quite pretty. I just needs a little somethin'-somethin'.

Great for a busy person with little ones and a great way to use too many berries.  This was super easy and I used half black and half blueberries.  Turned out great!

These muffins are very good!  I am not the type to ever reach for a blueberry muffin (or anything made from Bisquick for that matter) if there are other breakfast items around, but I did like these quite a bit.  I prepared them exactly as the recipe states with 1.5 cups fresh from the farm blueberries dredged in flour.  The muffins were perfect - moist and not too sweet.  I also agree with the other reviewer that you can't even tell it's Bisquick!  The sour cream makes all the difference.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Excellent!  I never start out wanting to modify a recipe, but my hand was forced in this case.  We only had light sour cream, and about 3/4c, so I topped off with light blueberry yogurt.  Only had heart-healthy biscuit mix as well.  Even with this, they turned out GREAT (and healthier)!!!  My husband was skeptical, but had two for breakfast.  Great, super flexible recipe.  Thank you!

Terrific recipe!  These are much better then then store bought mini muffins and so much cheaper!  I used chocholate chips instead of berries, since that's all I had on hand, and they turned out perfect!  My husband and son loved them, so that's enough for me to keep making them!

This is a great blueberry muffin recipe. I made them for my family after the New Year and they all grumbled because they were trying to lose those extra holiday pounds and didn't want any sweets, but once the first person tried one, the rest followed, and pretty soon all of the muffins were gone, diets begone!  The only thing I changed in this recipe is that I added a teaspoon of vanilla, just thought it needed it to make the muffin taste more sweet, and they came out beautifully.  This recipe is a keeper, I am actually planning on making more muffins tomorrow since the first batch went so quickly.

very good and about as easy as it gets.  went a little shy on the sour cream and used 2 med. eggs because my frozen berries were a little juicy.  came out moist and between my husband, myself, and our 6 & 4 yr. olds, they were all gone for breakfast.

If I could have given these muffins 10 stars I would have, easily. I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use up some strawberry yogurt and a few strawberries in my fridge. Simply delicious. I used the yogurt in place of the sour cream and strawberries instead of blueberries. I will be making this recipe a lot. sooooo good!!WOW!

This recipe was so easy, but I was scared it was going to be too plain so I too added some cinnamon and vanilla and the crumbly topping (butter, flour, cinnamon, sugar).  I also used frozen blueberries (coated in the flour mixture) and didn't have a problem at all.  They were delicious!!! They taste homemade, not like they've got bisquick at all!!

These are outstanding! We love the slight tang of the sour cream. So simple. They're in the oven in minutes.  I use 1 cup of sugar, 7 or 8 shavings of lemon zest, and top with Sugar In The Raw, as enjoyed by another reviewer, and WOW! We make these often.

Really, really good.  My modifications were:  1.  added one egg white in addition to the two eggs, 2.  added vanilla and almond extract, 3.  added cinnamon.  I used light biscuit mix and light sour cream.  Would make again!

Family requested blueberry muffins for breakfast, and I was out of flour and butter.  Didn't think I would find a recipe that didn't have those, but this one was perfect.  These are delicious and bake up so beautiful.  They were perfectly domes and browned just the right amount.  I used sugar in the raw on top, which added a very nice crunch.  It's so nice to know that I can make delicious blueberry muffins even when out of essential ingredients.  Great recipe!

These muffins are quite good. Couldn't taste the difference with sour cream, though they were more moist than the typical blueberry muffin. They would probably taste heavenly if I were to heat them up and put a little butter on it. Yum!

These were very ordinary.  Sour cream added calories and no flavor.

These are super easy and my entire family LOVED them!!! I did add some vanilla and sprinkled tops with sugar.  We had fresh blueberries from our garden but I think this recipe would work well either way.  I'd like to try it with chocolate chips too!!!

These get 5 stars because:  They are delicious!  They have no butter in them!  They are pretty!  My children and I made these this morning.  We sifted the baking mix first and added vanilla, as suggested in the reviews.  Yum!  Thanks for the delicious, kid friendly recipe!

These were really tasty & very easy to make. Everyone loved them. I did use frozen blueberries & mixed them into the dry ingrediants first. I topped them with coarse sugar and it was perfect with the rich taste of the sour cream. Definitely will make these again!

Grandaughter needed a class snack for school tommorow, I had fresh blueberries on hand but not a lot of time. This recipe was perfect. Quick, easy and does not taste like biscuit/baking mix. Made 48 mini muffins. I did read other reviews and added a dash of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla (and rolled the fresh bluberries in flour). I will make these over and over trying lemon zest instead of the cinnamon and vanilla and many other combinations. The sour cream makes these moist and light. The kids are going to love these..thanks Tory for making grandma a rock star!

this recipe gets 5 stars for the taste combined with how quick and easy they are to make.  I added about 1/2 cup more blueberries because I had some I needed to use up ... great recipe, it's my 3rd time making it!

These muffins are great comfort food.  Super easy, super fast, and so good.  A very tender muffin.  I love the blueberries, but I'm sure that it would be fabulous with bananas, or other berries.  I plan to use this frequently.  Thanks for a great recipe with ingredients I always have on hand.

I usually have to under bake my muffins so that they stay moist enough to satisfy my fussy husband.  The raw centres gross me out, so I'm quite relieved to have found a MOIST muffin recipe that I get to bake all the way through.   Oh, and he also hates blueberries, so I substituted a can of chopped peaches for the blueberries and added a bit of nutmeg.  Thanks!

I made this recipe this very morning--they are still warm from the oven as I type! A huge hit in our household. I used sugar in the raw (turbinado) for the sugar topping.  The batter did seem a little dry so i added about a tablespoon of half-n-half to it. My boyfriend said they are so good he could easily eat them all! Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This is a good basic Bisquick recipe with endless possibilities.  I added 2 eggs by mistake and it still was fabulous.  Can't wait to try the recipe as-is.  Also, after reading reviews I added about a tsp vanilla and a pinch of mace and substituted frozen cranberries.

These are delicious and simple! Easy to wake up in the morning and throw together in just a few minutes and have warm muffins within a half hour. I also cut this recipe in half often for just 6 muffins, so there are not many leftovers because these are just too easy to do right when you want one.

This is my go-to recipe for any type of fruit!  Apples, peaches, blackberries, or strawberries all work well.  I dust the tops with cinnamon sugar and add a tablespoon of almond flavoring.  These can also be made low fat by using fat free or light sour cream.

Great recipe! Incredibly simple and a big hit. I took them to a potluck dinner and they disappeared. I've made them a couple times and tend to get more like 16 muffins out of the batch.

I'm not really sold on these.  I used pancake mix, as suggested by another review, and the muffins themselves are good, but I'm not sure about all that sugar on top.  If I make these again, I will leave that off, or replace it with a streusel.  I don't like that much white sugar in a bite of muffin... weird.  But it's an easy enough recipe, I could experiment with it.

How often have you used short cuts in your home cooking and been disappointed? You won't be this time..this is a WOW! The sour cream is the secret in these muffins. It makes bisquick sing the high notes.
I added struessel before baking and these blueberry muffins were GONE within hours. Cherish this recipe.

These are moist, and just sweet enough.  No need to tweek this recipe.  But it's probably a great recipe to make your own with some added vanilla, cinnamon, etc.  This is the second time making these, but this batch I used a mini-muffin pan.  They turned out perfect.  Thanks for posting!

With a 4.5 star average rating, I was expecting a lot more. The end result LOOKED fabulous and the texture was perfect, but the taste--flat out bland. I won't be making these again.

Quick, simple and delicious. I will try adding a few more blueberries and perhaps a tsp of vanilla to my next batch.  It's a keeper though, that's for sure.

I wanted to add some cinnamon some other reviews mentioned, and the lid came off while I was sprinkling.  About a 1/4 cup of cinnamon fell out...the muffins still tasted great!  I did have an awkward amount of batter though, too much for 12 muffins, but not enough for 24.  I put the rest into a bread pan.

Very easy and very good. The reason I only gave 4 stars was only because I think it needs a little more taste...some vanilla, cinnamon, etc. Thanks for sharing.

Really good and easy.  I made some modifications.  Add zest of one lemon to batter, top muffins with mixture of  butter, brown sugar.  Take 1/2 stick butter semi soft mix with 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 tbsp white sugar crumble with fingers and spoon one tbsp into top of each before baking. great for breakfast or dessert.

Great recipe! Made them to be breakfast muffins to grab on the go. You can taste the difference the sour cream makes, it's really good! (Used Shamrock Farms organic sour cream. Yum!)

Great recipe - easy, tender,  delicious, and freeze beautifully. Only alternation made was to reduce amount of sugar to 1/2 cup - made previously w/3/4 c. sugar - sweetness overpowered blueberries - also used 1-1/2 c. fresh blueberries.  Make these again and again!  Thank you for the recipe.

super simple, nice flavor. I used plain, non-fat yogurt for the sour cream and reduced fat baking mix.  Will definitely make these again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Awesome muffins! I loved them! I did follow the advice of Jeannine and liked the result. However, I did think the amendment of half and half white and brown sugar was just slightly too much brown sugar to me. I would still alter the recipie by adding brown sugar too, maybe not as much as half and half ratio though. I would have probably put the sour cream in very last just because I just barley overmixed trying to incorporate everything else and mixed the cream up to much in the process. Would have been better with little globs of sour cream. Other than that, great!

Excellent, quick choice for using up baking mix. I followed the recipe exactly, made it 1 1/2 times and split it between 2 8x8" pans for a morning 'kucken'. I mixed the dough, put it in the buttered pans, sprinkled a pint of thawed blueberries over the 2 pans, sprinkled a handful of sugar over each and baked at 375 for about 25 minutes. Got rave reviews from my family.

OMG...out of this world good! I was skeptical but went for it as some of the other recipes had more reviews but curiosity got me. I used 2 cups fresh plus 1/2 cup frozen blueberries. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon per suggestion of other reviewer. I also made streusel topping (brown sugar, flour, butter). Baked in convection oven for 22 min. Came out PERFECTLY beautiful and delicious. Excellent recipe!

High marks for this recipe for the short ingredient list and yummy results! Easy to make early in the morning when you are still bleary-eyed. The sour cream adds a nice note to this sweet muffin. Fantastic recipe.

It is crazy how so few ingredients can make something so tasty. Beware: these dry out quickly so you must eat them the day of baking, which shouldn't be a problem because one is never enough.

I am so impressed with this recipe. Super easy to prepare and the sour cream makes these muffins very moist. Would be good with any fruit. I was low on blueberries so i threw in what i had along with some sliced strawberries and a mashed up banana just for fun...yum!

I too was wary of this recipe with the ease and very few ingredients but was pleasantly surprised!  Very easy, very good.  4 star rating because I used paper muffin liners and they stuck pretty bad to those.  But very good taste.

Really simple to make and they have a nice texture. I topped with turbinado sugar. I think I will add a dash of vanilla or almond exract next time for a bit more flavor. Thanks!

Easy & tasty. The Bisquick gives them a bit of a salty flavor I don't care for, but they were still good. The fresh blueberries make up for it.

I had only non-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, so I used that. I have to watch my sugar so I used 1/4 cup splenda in place of 1/4 of the sugar. I only had 1/2 cup of blueberries, so I made half with blueberries and to the other half of the mix I added a very ripe bannanna. I also added some vanilla and lemon rind.
Then to add insult to substitutions, I forgot to sprinkle the sugar into the muffin tins after I greased them, so I spinkled some sugar on top.
The end result: the taste was good, but I will add more sugar next time and not forget the sugar in the cups. The texture was just right with the yogurt, but without the sugar in the tins, they stuck and were hard to get out, so don't forget the sugar.
The bannanna muffins were good too, but could also use some more sugar.  Their texture was good and they were moist.
All in all, this recipe seems to be a keeper, one that even I couldn't mess up completely.

Excellent recipe...I also tried pitted frozen sweet cherries which I chopped up in a small processor after slightly thawing them.  I still used the suggestion that they be dropped into the dry ingredients before adding the eggs and sour cream. I also use half the sugar by using Splenda instead. I'm sure that any berries will work in this recipe.

I must admit, i typically dont make any recipes that arent "from scratch" but i had some baking mix and some sour cream that i wanted to use up- so i thought i would give this recipe a try.... i think they turned out pretty good. They have a little different texture then the typical blueberry muffin made with butter etc... 
I do recommend these, however, for a quick and easy muffin if you are in a hurry.

THESE WERE AWESOME!  I probably over mixed them - I got more than 1 dozen from this recipe.  I also added a generous handful of frozen mixed berries to the mix instead of just 1 cup of blueberries.  I took the advice of others and only put in 3/4 cup of sugar to start and then I sprinkled sugar without measuring how much exactly was put on.

We made this recipe to use up some biscuit mix we had in our pantry.  Like just about everything made with biscuit mix, these muffins had that kindof doughy-dry taste.  But, hey - blueberries and sugar, how can it taste bad?  Biscuit mix is no substitute for your own batter though.  Unless you are in a real pinch or trying to use up the last bit of Bisquick in your pantry, stick with a real muffin recipe - it's really not that much harder to mix your own.

Simple and delicious!  Even my husband doesn't mind whipping these up for a Sunday morning breakfast.

Excellent! easy and tasty! I did have to add a little water b/c the batter was to thick. Will make again for sure.

Amazing! Good idea definitely. I would advise cutting down the sugar but DO NOT cut out completely!=awful. The sour cream is too powerful, plus mine was even more sour :P. That taste will be overwhelming if you don't put the sugar in. Thanks! :)

Good and easy to make, however they need to be eaten the same day. I had mine sealed in an air tight container and by day 3 they were unedible and needed to be thrown out. To bad because they were very tasty.
