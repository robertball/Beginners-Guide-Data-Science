I decided on one change before I ever started. 3 cans of tomato paste would have been overkill. I decided to start with just 1 can and even that was too much. I ended up having to add a lot more of the other ingredients to compensate for the dominate tomato paste from a can taste. Another thing I did not like and don't felt it belonged was the ginger. I ended up adding a bunch to the recipe to make it work but I won't attempt this one again. Sorry.
