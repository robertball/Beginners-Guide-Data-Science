It seems like maybe the recipe is missing something? First off the marshmallows and milk would NOT combine. I ended up adding more marshmallows (basically doubling what the recipe called for) and it was still a lumpy mess-- melted marshmallows floating on top of warm milk. I beat the cream and then stirred the heck out of the marshmallows and milk before adding the cream. It immediately began to seperate. I poured it into the crust anyway and put it into the fridge hoping it would set and look more appealing. I checked it this morning... nope. Still looks like a lumpy mess in a chocolate crust. It tastes like overly-minty whipped cream but needs sugar/sweetness badly. I will not be making this again.

This pie turned out perfectly. I added some green food coloring to the marshmallow/whipped cream mixture to make it look more festive. Also put some shaved dark chocolate on the top. Barb

I had no problem with the marshmallows and milk combining, but I heated them in a saucepan on the stove. I also used chocolate cookie crumbs for the crust instead of oreos (no creme filling). It turned out tasty and did set up well.
