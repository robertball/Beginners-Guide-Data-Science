This is super good! I didn't add the candied walnuts to the top because of allergies and I also just made one layer instead of 2. But the taste is phenominal, thanks for a great recipe!

a delicately flavoured, moist cake.  Good without the walnuts.  I do suggest you make your own pie filling rather than using canned.

Good and lasts a while in the refrigerator.  My candied walnuts didn't turn out that great--not sure if it was me or the recipe (which I followed).  Next time I will not use canned apples...I'll saute fresh ones with a little sugar and cinnamon.   A nice fall cake.

The apples make a delicious and moist addition to this cake.  I wish it had a little more spice though.

Absolutely delicious! My ancestry is Polish so I  enjoy  trying the  flavors and cooking  that comes  with it.  I've made this cake for our  extended family Christmas  meal and it is always finished!  I  followed  the recipe to the "T" except for the candied walnuts...they didn't  turn out so well  the   first  time and so I've never tried  them  again.  A very good recipe!
