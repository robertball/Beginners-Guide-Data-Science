Next time will trade the asafoetida for garam masala (actually, added a spoonful this time and liked it a whole lot better.)
Very easy-made the paneer a day ahead. Very simple recipe and really delicious.

Oh my ever loving Jesus, this is good. A few substitutions: fenugreek use fennel seed in the same proportions. For Asafoetida: 2 cloves of garlic, minced and pan roasted. YUM!

I love paneer, but recently found out I'm allergic to milk (not just lactose). I'm trying this old favorite with firm tofu for the first time! I also like to add some fresh fenugreek leaves when I have them, replacing some of the spinach. I recently got some fenugreek seeds for my sprouting jar, so I should be in Palak-heaven soon!

I'm sorry, but we did not like this. Looks like the picture, like soup. Might be a traditional recipe, but nothing like "restaurant style" like I had hoped. Consistency was unpleasant. We threw the rest out and will be looking for another recipe.

I had no idea I was capable of replicating the incredibly rich and deep flavors of Indian cuisine until I tried this recipe. Simple, delicious, and nutritious, it's a clear win.

I used a combination of spinach, collard greens, chard, and kale and it still came out great. Mix and match to your heart's content! I also substituted about 2 tsp fresh ground coriander seeds for asafoetida (which I couldn't find in the grocery store), tofu for the paneer and regular butter for the ghee. (Maybe I got a little lazy ;) ).

IMPORTANT: Did not yield 6 servings. More like 2 1/2 good sized portions.
