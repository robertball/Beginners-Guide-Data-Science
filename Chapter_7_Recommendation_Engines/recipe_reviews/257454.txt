These scallops are great.  I served them on a bed of sauteed baby spinach with jasmine rice.  Quick and tasty meal.

I really dislike leaving a bad review but this wasn't the best method for cooking scallops. I cut the recipe back to one serving and used a smaller pan.  On med. heat scallops will not become deeply browned in one or two minutes and by that time the shallot is burned leaving a bitter taste. The lemon was a nice touch.

I had some scallops and was doing a search to find out how long to cook them when I found this quick and easy recipe.  I actually had all the ingredients on hand.  It was good, although I might use some butter with or instead of the olive oil next time.  It took a few minutes longer than indicated in the recipe, bu I had this with steamed broccoli, and it worked well.

Very easy to make, and was delicious. Just make sure not to over cook the scallops!  I served it with some spaghetti which soaked up some of the lemon/shallot goodness.  I will definitely make this again.
