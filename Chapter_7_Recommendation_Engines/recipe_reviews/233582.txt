This is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site!  The only changes I made were I used a whole pound of bacon (it was just easier), I used regular tomatoes (both yellow and red) because I didn't have any cherry ones, and I ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store didn't have arugula - I could have used fresh spinach I guess.  I also made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time (although I could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site.)  The creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish.  I would not substitue it for anything since I've already done it this way! The creme fraiche didn't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness.  I should have taken a picture because the yellow and red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish.  My teenagers also loved this and I know my husband would have, but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone. Poor guy.  I didn't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though. This dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always!

This is simply wonderful!! I too followed the directions exactly and found myself gobbling it up, which I usually don't do with meals I've cooked. My husband also went for seconds. My store didn't have the creme fraiche so I had to make my own. Super easy recipes online! I'm also a huge fan of BLT's, so that might have something to do with my love for this dish. Will make again

I made this with sour cream the first time and we really loved it. I added sun-dried tomatoes for a little more flavor. I wanted to try it with the creme fraiche, so I made it again. We preferred the tang the sour cream added for sure, so I'll be making it again and again but with the sour cream. I omitted the lemon as we didn't care for it in this dish.

This was just ok. Arugula is not my favorite and I should have known the kids wouldn't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time.  The arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion and it didn't resemble a BLT at all because of that.  I think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better.

I made this tonight.  It was pretty good, the only request being for more bacon.  More bacon is good.  The next time I’ll use a pound.  As is my custom, I went through the comments looking for suggestions and found a few.  Crème fraiche became sour cream.  Ditalini pasta became Fred Mayer’s small stuff that was on sale two weeks ago.  Argula became spinach.  Maybe argula is finer chopped than spinach but four cups of chopped spinach just about overflowed my 12 inch by 1 ½ inch iron skillet.  Next time I’ll cut back to three cups.  I found a way to cut down on the mess from chopping spinach while at the same time getting it done faster and doing a better job.  Having not ever seen a recipe requiring whole spinach leaves, I just chopped up the whole plastic container of Freddy’s baby spinach leaves using the scissor-like multi-bladed chopping tool that the boss cook bought on one of her Pampered Chef forays.

Very good combination of flavors. I used (1) 1lb. box of mini penne pasta, 1 lb of bacon. I doubled the rest of the ingredients other than the cream fraise, which I used the entire jar I had just made. This recipe is a keeper.

Would have been lovely if AllRecipes hadn't converted "two cups" of pasta to "16 oz" of pasta. Really, I'll learn to ignore what they put on the shopping list - and beware if you haven't already noticed that little "feature". Other than needing double everything because it was too much pasta, it was tasty.

Easily my favorite recipe I've ever made.  Used the Chef John creme fraiche recipe as well, have made this about ten times now and everyone is always blown away.

This is really awesome, and quick and easy to boot.  The boyfriend had three helpings and requested that I make it again soon.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I can't wait to try it with tomatoes from my garden.  Definitely a winner!  Thanks Chef John  :)

I trimmed the fat on the bacon and cooked it without the oil. Used macaroni noodles since that's what I had and omitted the cayenne pepper. Used Chef John's recipe for crème fraiche but used 1 1/2 cup of it. After tossing it, I tasted it and it was missing something. I squeezed 1/2 lemon and that made a huge improvement. My husband loved it, my son not so much even though he's a fanatic of bacon. He didn't like the taste of arugula. I liked it. The arugula did over power the salad. The next time, I'm going to try fresh baby spinach and 1/2 the batch, except for the bacon, since it made a huge amount.

I made this recipe tonight but used mayonnaise (thinking of a BLT sandwich) with lemon juice and garlic as the dressing  - less exotic but wonderful.  Used regular tomatoes.

The only problem is I can eat too much of this because it is so delicious. I made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time. I used a large beefsteak tomato chopped. I made a little more pasta to make it stretch and added an extra dollop of creme fraiche. I also used bow-tie pasta.

Have made this twice now just as suggested without modification and it was EXCELLENT! Last night I made it and, after taking advantage of a sale of fresh, pre-cooked, shrimp (12-16 count), I added a pound of those lil darlins to the recipe after I had added the "creme fraiche". I followed the recipe steps, as directed, after that. WOW! You want to take this recipe to another level, even though it is already incredible, just add shrimp! Unbelieveable! Thanks John... this is one heck of recipe that we will include in our weekly rotation.

P.S., I didn't have creme fraiche this time around so I substituted Fage Greek Yogurt. It is a great substitute if you didn't take the time, like I did, to make creme fraiche. ENJOY!

Husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Arugula isn't a favorite of mine so I substituted kale which had been cooked for a short time in chicken broth to "tenderize" it and make it less bitter.  It worked well, the dark green very colorful with the tomatoes.  Cut the recipe in half and there were no leftovers (husband dislikes eating leftovers)

wow, this was delicious.  i didn't have creme fraiche, so i used yogurt - it was fine. i also didn't have any lemons, so i can only imagine how much brighter some lemon zest would make it.   i might use sausage next time, just to mix it up.

It's fun, simple and DELICIOUS!  Perfect recipe for my 5 year old son to help.  The hardest part was keeping him from eating all the tomatoes beforehand. :)

Made this the other night and it was a big hit.  Only made a couple of changes. First off I doubled the recipe because I was feeding a large hungry bunch.   I used Tortiglioni pasta (large spiral tubes)  Used kale rather than arugula (just because that's what I had in the fridge) and my grocery store was out of the creme fraiche so I substituted with sour cream and a spoonful of savoury garlic cream.  Great warm from the stovetop or as a cold leftover the next day.  Very happy with this recipe.  A keeper for sure!

Very good, and different! My wife said only a man could come up with this (?) but she did enjoy. Couldn't find the ditalini pasta so used cornetti, which sounded fancy but looked a lot like regular macaroni. I used campari tomatoes quartered, and had to cook them a lot longer than 1 minute to soften them up. Although I upped the recipe to 6 servings, I found the sauce needed just a tad more liquid. Will make again for sure!

I loved it as did my husband and middle son. My oldest (16) and youngest (12) didn't love it. Can't imagine why. It was fabulous and I can't imagine switching out the creme fraiche for anything else. Wonderful but quite fatty meal.

This was really good! I forgot the Parmesan cheese, but it was still good. I also added a little over a teaspoon of Montreal steak seasoning instead of the salt and pepper.

This blew my mind!  I'm sure it's best with creme fraiche or even sour cream, but I used greek yogurt to see if I could cut down on calories and it was still amazing (but careful not to cook the yogurt - it'll curdle)!

I placed the dish on the table and my child ask, "What is it?'. I say "BLT pasta". One child blurts out, "I don't like BLT". Clearly, you don't know the goodness of a BLT sandwich. But after one fork full, it was bliss. I could see it. Consequently, I had to make a second batch. Even, the tomatoes disappeared.

Fantastic dish, used baby spinach instead of arugula. The creme fraiche was supper easy to make. My daughter, who eats next to nothing, actually went back for three helpings. Can't wait to make this for friends, and more for me!!!

Made this recipe tonite for dinner. It was excellent. The only change I made was instead of adding 2 cups of tomatoes, I only added one cup which was plenty. Will definitely be making again.

The three men in my family really liked this, and that's how many it fed. Being a vegetarian, I didn't have any, so am rating it on their reaction. It was easy to prepare. I used sour cream.

Just made it tonight and it was good! I had to substitute with sour cream, baby spinach, grape cherries, and mini bow tie noodles because my grocery store didn't have the ingredients. So glad it still turned out good! Thankful in San Diego!

Loved this recipe- so delicious and easy! Cooked the bacon in the oven and then proceeded with the recipe. The lemon and garlic really bring it to life. Will surely make again and again.

Add the lemon zest to the pan right before the creme fraiche. It can easily burn. Took only a moment for it to become fragrant. And I really recommend adding Parmesan at the same time you add the creme fraiche. It needed a little bolder taste. I also think this would be a wonderful dish with pancetta.

This recipe is very, very good I will make it again. Now, I unfortunately did not have arugula at hand so I used baby spinach. The recipe came out delicious. It is also very satisfying. I ate the remaining sauce with crusty bread. This recipe will now be on my permanent repertoire and as an option to use leftover creme fraiche.

Loved it! I made it for myself because I know my husband isn't a huge tomato fan (I loveeeee tomato and arugula) but he actually loved it, too, and even said that I should make this a part of our rotation when we cook. So... I found this recipe right before I got off work, so I didn't have time to make the creme friche or whatever it's called, and unfortunately the grocery store didn't carry it, either.. I was scared, but decided to go ahead and use sour cream instead (I normally love sour foods, but I was afraid this would be a bit much). I LOVED it with sour cream. I can definitely see where someone might think it's too overpowering, especially if you don't like sour flavors, but it was mouthwatering to me and was like a crazy roller coaster of sour cream, tomato, and lemon zest. Oh, and I would add more lemon zest than what is listed in the recipe, and I used an arugula-spinach mix which was delightful.

This was one of the best salads ever!  Even my husband enjoyed helping make it.  We used our side burner on the gas grill and did everything outside - delish!  One minor change was after reading previous reviews, we added the full lb. of bacon because we're bacon lovers.  Thanks for sharing Chef John - love your recipes!

This was a big family hit! We're not big arugula fans so I used an arugula and spinach combination and no one complained. I added an extra pinch of cayenne pepper as it needed a bit more spice. Next time I would reserve a little of the pasta water to help smooth out the cream cheese (no Creme Fraiche).  This is a great pasta for the family, especially those who like bacon.

I used sour cream since I could not find crème fraiche.  I also used tri-color rotini and spinach instead of arugula.  My husband said it was a keeper.  This recipe was very easy to cut in half for just the two of us.

I did like this very much - it's one of the better one-dish pasta recipes I've tried.  The creme fraiche base for the sauce is very nice - I ended up supplementing creme fraiche with a couple spoons of sour cream because I didn't have enough creme fraiche, and I could taste both of them in the end result.  IMO creme fraiche is much better in the recipe --  substituting sour cream would not be optimal.  I also added some quartered salami slices and some halved black olives not called for by the recipe, and I cooked the pasta in part chicken broth part water to try to boost flavor.  I reserved some pasta water and I needed that to keep the dish moist as I kept the pan on the heat long enough to wilt the spinach (I used spinach instead of arugula) and soften the tomatoes.  I made the recipe 1-1/2x to feed a couple more people, and I had to leave the dish on longer than the recipe said to wilt the spinach and soften the tomatoes.  Maybe that was just because there was more volume of food in the pan?  Though I used my big Viking 13" saute pan - it should have been big enough.  Anyway, this pasta dish has a very nice flavor.  I especially liked the creme fraiche used as it was here.  My kids liked the dish.  Chef John, thank you for the recipe!

Yes yes yes, so much yes! Chef John does it again. Perfect dish, amazing balance of flavors. I went all organic with this one; highly recommended so that you get the best of each ingredient! Won't even cost you that much. The creme fraiche with the bacon/lemon/garlic was so good and smelled so delicious while cooking! I dare you not to steal a few pieces of bacon before it's fine! This would be the perfect date/ company at home meal. It's easy and your guests will delight in the heavenly aromas wafting from the kitchen. I will make this again and again. Thanks Chef!

Family loved this recipe, or at least my modified version (based on what we had on hand): homemade yogurt instead of creme fraiche, macaroni instead of ditalini, kale instead of arugula, and asiago instead of parmesan.

It made a quick, easy, & affordable dinner that was restaurant quality. I substituted sour cream and an arugula/spinach mix, used 1lb bacon, and topped with Parmesan cheese and chives.  Everyone loved it! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my dinner rotation.

This was very good. I did not care much for the arugula, would substitute spinach next time Just for personal preference.

This was a new kind of recipe for me. I used elbow macaroni instead of diateli (I couldn't find it) and full-size tomatoes (not cherry). I didn't find creme fraiche, so I used Chef John's recipe to make it myself. I think the lemon zest was too strong, so if I make this again, I will leave that out.

I made this for my family all last summer and it was a hit each time. If anyone is looking for a great summer pasta salad you should try this one. I added the arugula once, and it was still good leaving it out.

Four teens and four adults devoured it. I added avocado to make it an BLTA pasta salad, because that's what we do in Los Angeles. If you can add an avocado, do it.

I used 12 oz. of bacon, sour cream vs. creme fraiche and spinach vs. arugula. Added a splash of white wine and more than a tablespoon of Parmesan. It was much better than I expected it to be.

This is so delicious!  I would suggest to make it exactly as the recipe states, with arugula, and definitely creme fraiche.  Such a wonderful flavor!  My whole family loves this dish :)

What a surprise.  Bacon and arugula are not my favorites but put them together with pasta, tomatoes and creme fraiche and -- what do you know -- it was delicious.  Doubled recipe (except for arugula) and it fed 5 hungry people with some leftovers.  They all loved it.

Chef John is my favorite and this seemed easy enough to try.  I was worried my husband would never go for the arugula but he surprised me.  In this recipe all the flavors just blended in so well. Have made it a couple times now and still really like it.

Sorry but hubby and I didn't like this at all.  Hubby said there are much better uses for bacon.  We usually love Chef John's recipes but this one really let us down.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add a bit more spinach.  Just not our thing I guess.

Very tasty weeknight meal.  I didn't have creme fraiche so made some with buttermilk and heavy cream and I added some sliced black olives, just because I love them in just about any savory dish.  The arugula makes this dish and I just happen to have a bumper crop of it, so always looking for recipes in which I might us it.

Love this recipe,  but like everyone else I had to do some modifications first I could not find creme fraite anywhere, went to at least 3 grocery stores apparently it's more of an item they sell during the holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas, I read some of the reviews and it seem a couple people used sour cream instead so first thing I used sour cream, and some mayo with it, I also used baby spinach instead of arugula, instead of cooking the bacon on top of the stove I cooked it in the oven which is how I cook all my bacon that way the smell doesn't take over the house, I also used a little bit of crush red pepper, some season salt and regular pepper to give it some flavor.  My husband love it and was upset I didn't make more this is going on my menu rotation.

Make only as much as you need.  Not as good the next day as the arugula wilts.  Think I would add more bacon next time.

This was good but not spectacular.  I am not a huge fan of arugula, so I should have known not to use it in the quantities listed here.  The whole dish just didn't seem to come together flavor-wise, and it didn't remind me of a BLT, but it was a good basic pasta salad.  Maybe spinach would work better for me personally; I may try it.  It isn't a bad pasta dish at all, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.

My husband loved this and so did I ! I have been instructed to make this again sometime :-).
I used a full pound of bacon, and added a little extra canned fire roasted tomato that I needed to use up.  Had to use some heavy cream instead of creme fraiche, and used spinach instead of arugula. Also substituted penne pasta as that  is what I had in the pantry.   This  is similar to other dishes I have made in the past, but love the addition of the lemon zest.  This one will go in my file of favorite quick dinners!

Used lime zest instead of lemon and it added a different flavor. I will try again wth lemon zest. I used canned tomatoes and won't do that again. This dish needs the sweet fresh tomato taste not bitter canned tomatoes.

This is a very nice salad as a main course. I used spinach. And I used 12 oz of bacon since that is how much was in the package. And I'm not sorry I used more! My store didn't have creme fraiche so I used sour cream and didn't use the lemon zest to compensate. I also opted to use the spinach and tomatoes fresh, meaning I didn't cook them at all.  I layered the bowl with spinach added the pasta mixture and topped with tomatoes. Very pretty. Loved this dish !

My husband enjoyed this! I didn't think he would with all the veggies! I'd maybe use 3/4 of the arugula next time. Like others have said it overpowered the other items a bit.  Once it cooked down and wilted a bit it was ok. I also used turkey bacon. Not bad!  Also: buy and use the Parmesan! It really added to the dish.

Pretty good!  I left out the lemon zest at the suggestion of other reviewers and added red chili flakes instead of cayenne pepper.  I love arugula so I kept that in there and it turned out delicious!  It's def a heavy dish with the bacon fat but so good!

I used pancetta rather than bacon; light sour cream instead of creme fraiche; spinach rather than arugula and I added fresh basil. I will definitely make it again - my husband and I both loved it. I also used different pasta.

I thought this was excellent.  I used Chef John's Creme Fraiche and followed the recipe exactly.   It was light and flavorful.

We really liked this recipe (can't go wrong with bacon!), but when I make it again I will omit the lemon zest. My husband and I like lemon, but my kids could do without it and I feel like this recipe could, too. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I used spinach instead of arugula. I also omitted the cayenne, and this dish really tasted like a BLT! It's a keeper!

Delicious. Only thing is recipe says ditalini pasta, which is a tiny pasta. I used cavatappi like the picture shows. And I left out arugula. I just served it with some nice green leaf lettuce.

On the spur of the moment I invited a friend over for supper. No time to go to the store, so I use what I had. I had all the ingredients but the creme fraiche. But, I did have mayonnaise and a packet of Ranch Dressing. I followed the recipe on the package: 1 cup mayo, 1 cup milk and the packet of Ranch Dressing. I also had tomatoes that I diced. (No cherry tomatoes.) I used 1 pound of bacon, because it needed to be used! Other than that, I followed the recipe to the "T"! My friend was very pleased with the salad. She even took leftovers for her lunch, tomorrow. This is a recipe that I will use over-and-over. I will use creme fraiche when I have time to plan ahead. As good as it was, I'm sure this will raise it a notch! Thanks for the recipe! I also had some eggnog in the freezer that I needed to use, so I made eggnog muffins to go with the salad. To spread on the muffins, I made a whipped orange butter.(Whip 1 stick butter, 3 oz cream cheese, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons  grated orange rind and 1 tablespoon frozen concentrated orange juice.)   I cleaned out a lot of ingredients and had a nice meal! A good bottle of wine didn't hurt!

I was forced to find a substitute for the creme- fraiche as I am lactose intolerant.  I used coconut milk and dairy free cream cheese.  And I had to use up some spinach instead of going for arugula, and added the whole pound of bacon.  Our store had mixed colors of baby tomatoes and I used those, the colors were beautiful, the flavor spot on and everyone had seconds.  It turned out deliciously!  Definitely keeping this one!

I made this for dinner last night I made 2 changes, I used tagliatelle pasta cut into bite sized strips and 2 cups of thinly sliced white button mushrooms. This made a huge bowl of delicious food and the family devoured the lot, one son had 4 helpings! The sauce was so yummy, the mushrooms added to the flavour, this will be a regular family meal from now on and so quick and easy to make and clean up after!

I'm lactose intolerant so I used Tofutti "sour cream" in place of the creme fraiche, which didn't have the same sourness as regular sour cream. I was happy it didn't curdle b/c I'd read replacing the CF with SC could do that. I put in 12oz bacon b/c that's what came in the package, and it was still a good balance of bacon in the dish. Overall, easy to make and tasty.

This was very good! I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the cayenne. The only changes I would make next time is to use less lemon zest. It absorbed into the tomato a little too much and each bite of tomato felt more like a lemon than a tomato. Thanks!

This recipe is AWESOME! It's one of those dishes that makes you constantly compliment it throughout the entire wolfing of the food. The mixture of bacon, lemon, garlic, creme fraiche is subtle yet complex. Add that to the peppery arugulaI and sweet grape tomatoes, and it is AMAZING. I roughly 2x/3x the amounts (have to have leftovers), which roughly was a full pack of bacon. I use nitrate free pork bacon (Hormel) and don't drain any of the drippings. I also added more garlic. This could be on The Cheesecake Factory menu along side their most requested pasta dishes. My husband asked me to PLEASE make this once a month. I will happily oblige! THANK YOU CHEF JOHN FOR ANOTHER GREAT ONE!

I have to say, this is as an old Southern grandfather used to say "something fine in this world."  I made the mistake of not adding enough greens, but it will correct that next time.

I made this for my family last night.  The recipe is easy to make and I didn't change a thing.  Everyone raved about it!  This dish delivers a wonderful bouquet of flavors from the lemon zest, garlic, bacon and tomatoes.  Thanks Chef John, I'll be making this one on a regular basis.  Todd R.

Any meal that my 13 year old son eats without complaint and that doesn't include hamburgers and fries is a 10 in my books.  We both loved it!
I made it as per the recipe but sprinkled the top with real bacon bits.

It came out delicious. I made the creme fraiche for the first time and its awesome. I added some onion to mine, after I rendered the bacon. My family loved it. The baby arugula is delicious in this recipe.

I used double the bacon and half the arugula (mainly because of my children's preferences). It was really good. Didn't have creme fraiche (or time to make it), so I added a bit of whipping cream. Would definitely make again, this time with more arugula.

Love this recipe.  I couldn't find crème fraiche so had to use sour cream, but it was still wonderful!  Otherwise, no other changes were needed or wanted.  Great recipe as written.  Keep 'em coming, Chef John!

I am an Expat living in Guadalajara Mexico and cook American type dishes for other Expats who crave food from North of the border.  I had 3 orders for this dish before I even made it.  I did substitute sour cream for the creme fraiche, added a little chopped ham (the bacon here lacks the flavor of American style bacon) and substituted spinach.  Next time I might also add cubed chicken and call it Club House Pasta LOL.  This is YUMMY!

Delicious! Even my kids gobbled it up and asked for more. Only change I made was that I added a small amount of spinach with the arugula and I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used chopped up celebrity tomatoes instead. Will definitely be making this one again!

I made this for my family of 6 tonight and everyone loved it; (however, my 3 year old picked out the cooked tomatoes.) I went a little heavier on the lemon zest and really heavy on the cheese - I topped the entire skillet with parmesan cheese :)

I followed the recipe except had no creme fraiche so I substituted olive oil mayo and some lemon juice. Another departure from the recipe was not adding the arugula to the skillet; I put it in each salad bowl and let people ladle the skillet mixture over it.  Absolutely delicious and maybe even better than a BLT sandwich!

This recipe is fast enough to make for a weeknight family meal and is soooo good.  The grocery store didn't have creme fraiche last time I made it so I used light sour cream and fat free half and half in a 2:1 ratio (2/3 c total per the recipe).  It was just as delicious as the first time I made it--a good substitute and probably healthier!
