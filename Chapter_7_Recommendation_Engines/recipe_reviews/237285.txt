These are hard to flip! Don't make them too big, no more than 3" diameter. Kids loved them, I'm not crazy about texture. Will substitute banana for applesauce next round.

My family is so picky when it comes to eating healthy, but these were a big hit!! We splurged by putting dark chocolate chips on top and there wasn't a a crumb left.

Music to my mouth!!! After having no sugar for 4 weeks, this small amount of honey tasted so good in this recipe! They look exactly like the real thing! Way to go!

I made these for a weekend breakfast.  They make an excellent low gi alternative. I swapped out the honey for powdered sweetener and the applesauce I made fresh,  (just allow it to cool before adding to the egg mix).  Definitely  a weekend  breakfast  make again.

Fantastic! I followed the ingredients exactly except I only had sweetened applesauce so I used that and omitted the honey (I later used the honey to top the pancakes- they have too good of flavor to smear with syrup). I do have a couple tips for cooks who had problems flipping the pancakes: I used a cast iron griddle, preheated, on med heat. When I spooned the batter I spread it out a little so the upper side dries a bit and when you flip there isn't any runny batter. Lastly be patient, cook first side past golden to brown (better flavor that way too). I was able to make 6" to 7" pancakes with no problems. Will definitely make again, wanna try variations of toppings and add ins. Thanks for the yummy, healthy, filling recipe!

We are a gluten free family so we are always looking for gluten free recipes. I made these exactly as the recipe says, but since I have a sweet tooth I added one more Tbsp of honey :-) MY KIDS LOVED THESE! I was worried because they are not traditional pancakes, but I should have doubled the recipe! This one was a winner for us! They take a little bit longer to cook, so you have to be patient. Flipping them is easier when you let them brown a little bit more. Great recipe and I will be making these again!

yummy!  I only used 2 eggs because that's all I had but added liquid egg whites to compensate.  I also only had a small single serve unsweetened applesauce and added about two teaspoonful of olive oil.

I made these with banana instead of applesauce. The banana seems to hold the batter together better. I also added 1 tablespoon of almond butter rather than using the honey. Also sliced strawberries make this pancake excellent with a little pat of Kerrygold Irish butter. No syrup required.

I used homemade  kefir instead of the coconut milk, and added blueberries for interest. I tried using the batter for both pancakes and waffles, and it was so tender that I couldn't turn the pancakes over before they burned, and the waffles stuck to the waffle iron. Something needs to be adjusted!

Pros: Easy to make, had all the ingredients on hand
Cons: Taste, consistency, difficult to flip

These are very thin and mushy, maybe more flour would help.

Found these to be really dry. I used mashed banana and regular cow milk, and skipped the honey as I also added chocolate chips. They were edible, but I doubled the batch because I was unsure of portion sizes, threw the left overs away :( Normally we reheat leftover pancakes in toaster for days later, not these! We are still adjusting to coconut flour, but will continue looking for a better pancake recipe.

I did not have coconut milk so I used a combination of almond milk and whole milk.  I used a tablespoon of brown sugar because it was easier.  I did not care for either the taste or texture.  I am a pancake-turning expert, so I had no difficulties with turning them.  They looked as if they'd be delicious, but they weren't.  They do take a long time to cook, so you can load your washer with clothes while they are cooking.  I ate one and fed the rest to the chickens.

I’m on whole 30 so they were approved for that but not the syrup I put on them...lol. They were okay but kind of thick and grainy in texture but they satisfied my craving for pancakes.

I give it to stars because it was really difficult to turn and very Easley burned. You have to cook them slowly because they’re very thick and definitely no more than 3 inches in diameter. I love the cinnamon taste it was awesome the texture was a little different. I’ve been off sugar for four weeks as well and the honey was great in it. I added some BlackBerries on top and it made me not notice the texture as much.  I’m going to try banana next time I think it’ll make the difference.

if you are expecting light fluffy pancakes this won't happen. coconut flour makes things a bit dense. This recipe is good. I saw many excluded the honey but I would recommend keeping it in. It acts as a binding so the pancake does not fall apart. I would also recommend not making large pancakes 3" diameter tops. 

This was still very good I used pumpkin instead of applesauce. will probably use this recipe as a base and do more tweaking to it next time I make them.

I just made this.  Trying to find the best gluten free breakfast.  I tried to cut the recipe in half.  Used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white, used 1/2 ripe banana instead of applesauce and LF milk instead of coconut milk.  I omitted the honey.  I found it to be sweet enough.  I didn't measure the milk, just added enough to get good consistency.  I topped pancakes with almond butter.  Next time I will defrost blueberries and use the liquid as syrup.

These are good! The best coconut flour pancakes we've had so far. You definately need patience when cooking these pancakes, the key is to cook them on low otherwise the outside will burn before the inside is cooked, also a little tricky to flip them over.

I followed this recipe almost to the T! Only omitted the honey. It had the craziest texture and was not very tasty at all.  I really wanted some pancakes too. It was crumbly and dry. How is everyone getting such great results?

The flavor of these pancakes are wonderful.  I added two more tablespoons of milk so they wouldn't be so cake like.  After adding the extra milk you have to continue to stir it before pouring in skillet.    I find that it takes them a long time to cook and brown quickly.  They are very hard to turn because they don't seem to cook like a normal pancake.  Slow to cook in the middle.  I also used raw honey.

Recipe was good, used banana instead because I ran out of applesauce. Most of the family liked it a lot, I have one very picky child who didn't LOVE it but still ate it.

I've made these several times. I substitute banana for the applesauce. I also add blueberries if they are available and add one packet of stevia instead of the honey. Hardly need any syrup!!

I will try to do this again with the exact ingredients. I substitute coconut milk with almond milk and unsweetened apple sauce with 1 teaspoon of honey, because I didn't have these ingredients in hand. I wasn't really crazy about it. But I will try again with the exact ingredients

Made it with bananas instead of applesauce & almond milk (silk brand) instead of coconut milk. Also cooked it with butter (didn't have coconut oil). Quite tasty. Very difficult to turn. Mine were all broken. But still yummy.

I will make these again!  Very tasty - texture is more appealing than the almond flour pancakes I made last weekend.  I will use a bigger pan to give more room for flipping though.

I just made my first coconut flour pancakes.. and I went the dairy route.  Just to say....I was scared by all the talk of hard it was to manage the pancakes and it was FINE!  Yes, the result was eggy, but they were light, fluffy, easy to flip.  Definitely try it!  My daughter didn't like them, but she doesn't like eggs.  Don't be scared - try it!

We loved them.  Next time I will make them smaller because they're hard to flip if they're larger than 3" in diameter.  The flavor is very good.  The texture isn't like the average fluffy restaurant variety, but we don't mind.  I will definitely make these again.

These taste awful, flat and heavy.
