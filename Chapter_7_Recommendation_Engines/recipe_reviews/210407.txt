I baked the cakes for 10 min and let sit for 5 like the directions said but I found that the cakes were more liquid than cake than I would like. Next time I will bake the cakes a little longer. Other than that whats not to like about hot liquid chocolate.

I made this once and it turned out pretty good. It tastes a little eggy if eaten after it cools down... but it was a hit when I made for a family reunion. I am planning to make this again when I will have friends over.
