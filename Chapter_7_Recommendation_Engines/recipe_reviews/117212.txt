I steamed my broccoli only just slightly, then sauteed them with the butter and seasonings. I used fresh minced garlic and a pinch of sea salt instead of garlic salt. We loved it. The lemon pepper seasoning combined with the thyme was a wonderful combination with the broccoli.

So easy and so good! I used a steam in bag of broccoli spears to cut down on time and used minced garlic vs. garlic salt then seasoned with a little salt.  Very nice blend of seasonings - it doesn't get much easier or tastier!

I prepared this exactly as written, however, I just eyeballed the seasonings rather than measure them precisely.  Would have never thought to season broccoli this way and hubs and I found we both enjoyed this tasty blend of flavors that really perked up plain ol' broccoli. Be very careful not to overcook - this is best crisp-tender and vivid green!

This is an easy recipe for a simple side dish. I steamed the broccoli instead of microwaving and then cooked garlic in the butter instead of using garlic salt.

Cooking has become a bit of a problem since my husband was diagnosed with type II diabetis and high bp..now things need to be high in carbs and low in sodium.  We have always had our broccoli with cheese sauce or lots of butter...no more.  This is a great recipe for both counts and the flavor is still there...thanks.

I modified this recipe slightly by blanching broccoli and skipping butter.  Still tasted fantastic.

I had to give this 3 stars because we did not like the taste of thyme with broccoli.  Having said that, I thought this was a great idea and next time I will modify it to our taste.

I forget how much I loved steamed broccoli, and this recipe was perfect! I thru it together so quickly and without the "hassle" of using a steam basket on the stovetop. I loved the seasoning, which I eyeballed, and the method that yielded perfectly steamed broccoli in minutes!

I'm rating the method rather than the overall flavor because I used different seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder) because I don't like thyme and didn't have any lemon pepper.  This was very good and easy for a basic steamed broccoli method.  I will definitely keep handy for a quick go to side dish. Tastes much better than frozen broccoli.

I used a microwave steamer bowl I got at a cheap dollar store. The broccoli was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. I left out the thyme and used garlic powder.

Good quick way to heat up veggies for a side dish without taking a lot of time or adding calories/fat.  I did broccoli and cauliflower.  I only heated up enough for two, and didn't know how that compared to the amount given in the recipe, so the seasonings may have been off a little.  I think I will essentially continue to experiment until we have "our" go to seasoning mix to do veggies this way.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband is always requesting broccoli for the health benefits, but never quite enjoys eating it ... he raved about this recipe after the first bite, had seconds, and fought the urge to have thirds!! He's already requesting this again, and wants to try it using different vegetables.

This was a nice way to dress up plain broccoli.  I omitted the butter (one of our guests was lactose intolerant) and everyone still raved about how good the broccoli was.  Thanks!

This was pretty good and different from just plain butter, salt, and pepper or the usual boring cheese sauce. I wasn't sure though that I particularly liked the lemon. My family liked this fine as there were no comments made and they cleaned their plates. This was okay, but I would rather not have it again.

We really like broccoli and certainly enjoyed the seasonings that go into this dish. It was a nice, clean, fresh taste. Great not to have a heavy sauce or casserole taste for a change.

I didn't have garlic salt, so I used fresh garlic and table salt. Very easy to prepare. The lemon pepper seasoning is what makes this dish.

Quick and simple, this is a good choice to accompany a rich main course.  The flavors are lively due to the seasonings, but no heavy sauce.  I served it with Creamy Spinach Tortellini and it was a nice choice.  Nothing fancy but very tasty.

pretty good; nothing spectacular, but better than plain broccoli. I used a steam-in-bag of broccoli, so this was very quick and easy to prepare.
