Although there is a rustic simplicity to Dash’s Donair recipe on this website, this version of donair is much more satisfying, so I’m surprised more people haven’t tried/reviewed it. The marinade adds a lot of body and flavor, making the beef especially tasty. I only make a few minor changes: 1) Surprisingly, I think whole wheat pita complements the dish better 2) I serve with lettuce, tomatoes and onions so family members can make their own sandwiches and 3) for the sauces, although I like hummus, I think it takes away from the flavor of the meat in this dish. I also remove the tomatoes from the parsley sauce because I serve with fresh tomatoes. This makes the parsley sauce stronger, but nestled among the meat and veggies, it doesn’t overwhelm. (As a side note, I usually have a lot of the parsley sauce left. Instead of throwing it away, I recycle it into another dish.  I cut large tomatoes in half – the hothouse/jersey variety – spread the tops of the tomatoes with a large spoonful of the parsley sauce and bake/broil in the toaster oven for 30 minutes. It makes for an interesting twist on the tomato/pesto side dish that goes well with a lot of meat/chicken meals.) I enjoy this recipe for lunch or as a light dinner, but it is particularly in demand with the menfolk during football season.

This was restaurant-quality deliciousness! My only complaints are that the meat was nearly over-cooked at the 30-minute mark, and for some reason there was a lot of liquid that came from either the meat marinade or parsley salad that dripped out & caused the pita to get soggy on the outside. Will make again and try to be more careful about how much liquid I spoon into the pita.

I have tried to make shawarma many times before but every time it turns bland or over spiced . this recipe is wonderful and that's what I was searching for , the whole family loved it . the only change I made was using white vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar . I only made the shawarma part and I added my own topping  :(Tomatoes-parsley - onion sprinkled with Sumac - green pepper - pickled cucumber - Tahini)

This is terrific, tastes just like a famous Lebanese restaurant in Seattle.  I made the following adjustments based on how the restaurant cooks the food:  I tripled the garlic in the beef marinade, and doubled it for the Tahini sauce.  Added some extra water to make the Tahini sauce thinner.  Also, I briefly carmelized some onions and cabbage on high heat and set them out for people to include in the assembled Donairs along with tomatoes and the sauces.

Very good. Made this with chicken instead of beef and skipped the tahini sauce because I didn't have any. The marinade is nice and complex.

We will try this one more time but the first time not so good.  Individually, most was good - the parsley mix was fantastic and light.  The marinated meat was delicious after cooking BUT my Tahini "dressing" didn't turn out at all.  I have worked with Tahini MANY times so I am quite familiar with it.  My "dressing" after following the recipe to a T was a paste.  We had to spread it on the flatbread with a knife and then the meat, parsley mixture and tomatoes.  Not sure what happened as I followed the directions.  Oh well, we will try again and if more successful will definitely update.

well, well, well. This is one of the ebst recipes I have ever had on this web site. My husband was raving about it for hours after he ate it! I followed it to a tee except one thing. I added a TBSP of white vinegar to the tahini sauce, which in my opinion, gave it a 'dressing' type quality. Thanks for the recipe! It was relatively easy, relatively healthy and SUPER yummy!

Sorry - we did not care for this all.  Perhaps it's just our particular taste buds, but the spice flavor was just not something we enjoyed in the meat.  I'm not sure if it was the allspice, or the cardomum. I followed the recipe completely, and I must say it smelled amazing while it was marinating, so I was truly disappointed when we didn't like the results. I would like to try again with a different mix of spices because I liked the cooking method - the meat turned out very tender.

This dish was perfect and easy and will be on our regular rotation.  I used chicken and left it marinating all day.  WE paired this with Lebonese Garlic an cilantro potatoes instead of serving as a sandwhich.  My boyfriend packed it for lunch the next day.

I have a "go to" recipe for chicken shawarma that i have made for years and i thought i would try something different.  The three different dishes (steak / parsley blend / and tahini) were excellent on their own but combined something was definitely off.

Just made this for my family --- a hit with my husband and son.  Meat turned out very tender.  I would cut the tahini sauce in half next time.  In the summer I might try grilling the meat, then slicing thin, but done as is was fine too.

Delicious, but very messy. It would make more sense to scoop this up with pieces of pita than to try to roll it up.

Wow, great combination of flavors!  I didn't follow the recipe completely though because I didn't have steak or lemons.  I used hamburger instead and substituted fresh lime juice for lemon.  I also combined the hamburger with leftover buckwheat I had (a nutty whole grain you cook like rice) which was fantastic!  It really complimented the cinnamon & allspice.  Another reviewer is right--the parsley mixture makes a lot!  Will definitely make again & try the beef with the marinade.

I'm planning on making this for supper...can't wait :)  I'm in Nova Scotia and could order it out but i'm interested in trying it on my own.  Our local Pizza joint, Recardo's, which is run by a Lebanese guy makes these deliciously.  For those of you having trouble with the sauce, you could make what's called a Kafta with the same meat but spread Miracle Whip over the Pita instead.  It turns out best if you heat the whole thing up in the over a bit before serving, makes it a little crispy and warms up the Miracle Whip and gives it a different taste... Enjoy!

It was delicious and strong. I will eat it for leftovers one more time and then I won't want to make it again for a while.  The flavors hung out in the bitter / sour area. 

I forgot to buy parsley, so I didn't use that. I also toasted my sesame seeds a little too long, so the tahini was more bitter than it should've been.  

But the meat was absolutely amazing. Good heavens. I used bottom round,  I think.

I will try to make it correctly next time. Even with this miffed attempt, it was awesome!

Had rave reviews.  The only ingredient I did not have was the cardamon but it was still delicious.  I used a bottom round that I was going to use for a roast.  I froze it for a couple hours to make it easier to slice super thin.  Marinated it for 24 hours.

Unfortunately, this did not go over well in our house. The only change I made was to substitute in chicken instead of beef. My boyfriend tried two bites and refused to eat anymore. I found it not going together well in general and just not worth making again.
