Five stars based upon my tasters rating. She said it was great the first day and better the second day. I thought it was good the first day and too moist the second day with water in the bottom of the pan. I grilled the tortillas first to provide a little structure. The black bean mash barely covered one layer of an 8 x 8 dish. The canned chicken I used was 1.5 cups per can so I used 2 cans. This was easy to prepare and not particularly spicy. Now what do I do with 1/2 tub of jalape√±o cream cheese?

I added about a half cup more chicken and an extra can of black beans to the recipe.  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so had to substitute several items but it turned out delicious!  The biggest critics (my children) loved it!  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles in place of the red bell pepper and diced onion.  Also, I substituted some crushed red pepper and cream cheese in place of the jalapeno-flavored cream cheese.

I could think of a hundred ways to modify this recipe, but I liked it as is.  The only modifications I made were using white corn tortillas (I am gluten free) and a Mexican style cheese blend.  The jalapeno cream cheese is surprisingly spicy, so if you want a milder flavor, you might like to use plain cream cheese.

I loved it, however it was way too much onion for my taste. Next time I will just use a small amount of onion but follow the rest of the recipe exactly. The rest of the family did not like it as much as I did, but said they would like it again.
