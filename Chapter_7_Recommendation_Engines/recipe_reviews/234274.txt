This recipe is so delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used around 2 TBS of heavy cream instead of milk and I melted it together with the caramels on the stovetop instead of the microwave.  Our caramel is not too chewy.  I will definitely make these again!

This is a very good recipe and everyone in my family loves these. I think the recipe should be more specific about the milk. To solve the caramel issue, use HEAVY CREAM to melt the caramels into sauce.  If you don't have cream, use WHOLE MILK (2% or less fat milk has TOO MUCH water that will just cook away during baking, making the caramels hard and chewy).

These are kind of weird......If you don't eat them hot, they could crack your teeth.  The thing I didn't like, is after microwaving the caramel, it doesn't just smoothly pour on.  It is clumpy and blobs on the brownies.  There is no uniformity to how it pours on.  They tasted good, but the lumpy, hard caramel was kind of hard to eat.  The saving grace was the salted caramel.   The flavors were good, but it doesn't quite work.  One reviewer suggested melting the caramel with cream, that would be better, I think.

Also, after melting the caramel, the bowl was soooo hard to wash.  If you run into that problem, pour some boiling water in the bowl to get the hard caramel off.

GREAT - with a little adjustment! Made 2 batches. First had the problem with caramel sinking and getting way too chewy on the bottom but crumbly on top. To correct the problem, we baked the brownie mix alone for 5 minutes, removed from oven and added the caramel, and then continued to bake for the rest of the time. They were perfect! SO GOOD!

I followed the recipe to a tee with the exception of all I had on hand was a box of brownie mix for a 9 x 13 pan. I followed the brownie mix recipe, then the rest of the above recipe. Before 28 minutes was up, the edges were crispy and the middle very soft. Once they cooled imagine our surprise when we cut into the brownies and tried to get them out of the pan and discovered all the caramel had sunk to the bottom!  They were as mess to get out and had to scrape the caramel off the bottom of the pan to get any. They were not done enough in the middle but too done on the outside. Once was enough for me!

Well I did this all wrong and even dropped the pan when removing from the oven.  They slid to one end so I had to spread it back out across the pan.  I lost a little to the floor. What was left was still delicious.  Maybe mixing them up after baking is the key!!  Now getting it off the floor was a different story!!

YUMMMMM!!! These brownies are so incredible that I actualy prefer them over regular brownies. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly so I don't know why people had issues. My only guess is make sure you do not overheat your caramel (should be able to easily stur and pour it when its ready). DO NOT forget to add the milk to your caramels. This makes it much creamier, easier to handel and will make it an easier consistency to eat. Also, make sure your brownie batter is already spread in your pan, and then lightly drizzle the caramel sauce on top (do not mix in, or pour in before the batter is in your pan). These make an incredibly impressive dessert that looks like you slaved over them for hours. Nobody would ever guess its just a spruced-up box mix!

Delicious and decadent. I followed the recipe except for adding 1/2 tsp of espresso powder which I think always improves boxed brownie mixes. This is better slightly warm as the caramel gets very sticky when completely cool. The addition of coarse salt is brilliant.

I love brownies, caramel and salt but the caramel was a very tough chewy consistency which was disappointing. I'm wondering if the caramels needed cream to improve the consistency? Even served warm the caramel was annoying to eat.

This recipe is so wonderful (and easy!) to make!  I took a pan to a neighbor's supper club, and the compliments poured in! I did not microwave the caramel sauce as instructed, but used the stovetop- which works better for me.  I was fortunate enough to use an exceptional brownie mix the first time!  Definitely a *make again* dessert... I will whip up a pan of these for any occasion!

This looked better in the picture. I baked the batter for about 10 min first to prevent the caramel from sinking to the bottom. The idea worked, but the top of the caramel got a bit burnt (making the brownie look unappetizing), and the rest of the caramel that was absorbed into the brownie was just very gooey. I will not make this again.

These brownies are awesome... I made them with a few minor changes... I used half and half when making the caramel sauce...  and I added the caramel to the top of the cooked warm brownies and the coarse salt... They were beautiful and amazing.  Also made these with caramel and crushed pecans on top omitting the salt...  They're so good! Thank you.

It turned out great!  Super simple and tastes fancy!  Didn't really change anything.  Had a last minute gathering and needed something quick and I had ingredients on hand.  Perfect!

Made these with heavy cream, and fudgy recipe brownie mix...really, really, really good!!!! Brought some to work, everyone thought it was a complicated dessert to make, haha!
The caramel sauce will harden if you take too long spreading it, but all I did was add a little more cream, a few more seconds in the microwave, and it was all good again.
I made two batches, one in a square pyrex dish, and one in a disposable aluminum pan. The pyrex brownies came out fudgier, and I think the caramel sauce needed to have a thicker layer. The thinner aluminum pan had the brownies less fudgy, so I think next time I will use the pyrex pan, and not make the brownies too thick. This way there is an even brownie-to-caramel-sea-salt ratio.

I used a 13x9 brownie mix cause that what I had in he pantry. Was worried about the caramel sauce sinking as others had said so I poured half the brownie mix in the pan and baked for 10 minutes. Let it cool a few minutes before pouring the caramel sauce on and topped with the remaining brownie batter.  I also used sweetened condensed milk and half a stick of butter with a whole bag of caramels melted and mixed together. Have used this sauce in other desserts and it doesn't harden when cool.  Brownies were a hit!!!

This recipe is ok. I followed the directions and microwaved the caramels and they melted nicely with some milk. To prevent the caramel from sticking I sprayed the bowl with a small amount if cooking spray. Worked like a charm. Overall to sweet for my taste.

Before I made this, I read a review of it that said the caramel sinks and sticks to the bottom of the pan, and I figured that person must have done it wrong. But then I made this recipe exactly as described, and the caramel did stick to the bottom, making the brownies impossible to get out in one piece, and leaving me with a pan almost impossible to clean. The caramel that did manage to stay inside the brownies is hard and candied, not gooey like I'd hoped.

These brownies were polished off in a few minutes at a tailgate!  I swirled the caramel sauce a bit as "drizzling" it seemed ineffective.  The only changes I made were to the box brownies (I use coffee instead of water and add a few T. unsweetened cocoa), as I think it brings out the chocolate flavor more deeply.  I highly recommend swirling the caramel sauce and sprinkled salt into your next batch of brownies!

This turned out wonderfully!  I made the brownie batter from scratch, and used a salted caramel sauce in place of the individual candies, to amazing results.  Very flavorful and great texture! Delicious.

Made these for my granddaughter’s volleyball team. They loved them. The only change I made was I used hot caramel ice cream topping.

This was delicious!  I used Almond milk for melting the caramels and it worked just fine.  Also I swirled the caramel through the brownie mix instead of just leaving it on top.  Both changes worked great.  This is a hit!

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday.  That was a mistake because this is not a brownie that you can pick up and eat without creating a mess.  
I read what other readers had written but the only thing I did differently was add a TBL of cream to the caramel.  From past experience I know this is necessary with caramel.  
With all that said.  They are good.  My husband and Sons loved them.  They just are not a carry away brownie.
