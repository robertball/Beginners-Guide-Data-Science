This was just O-K.  Once all the ingredients were combined, I could tell that, in all, it just wasn't that interesting.  Soooo, I added a little (well, actually a lot) of red pepper.  It definitely kicked it up and made the soup a lot more tasty.  I also used about 3 times more ham than what is called for; it helped things along too.  All in all, there was still something missing, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was.  I will likely not be making this again; all the family could muster is, "well, it's different for sure".

I don't make a lot of soup with rice, but this recipe is so good! I had some ham to use up, plus some half and half, so it was perfect. The only thing that I did different was add some cayenne pepper just before serving, and used a wild rice mix, as that is all I had. We like most things with a little "kick". We had it with salad and crusty french bread, and it was wonderful! Thank you for posting. It will be on our special soup list from now on.

Wow~ is right!  This soup is very yummy.  I added 1 cup of diced ham & 1 cup of diced chicken.  I also used 2% milk (lower fat) and it still was rich and creamy.  Sherry is optional.  Would definitely make again!

I did not rate this a 5 only because I thought it had too much pepper and it was too thick.  And I like pepper, but a tbl and a half was too much. Next time I will add only 2 tsp of pepper and use only 3/4 cup flour to make the roux.  Other than that it turned out very good and very hearty.  My store did not have plain wild rice so I bought a brown and wild rice blend and I liked the variety of rices.  I ended up adding two more cups of chicken broth to thin it down a little. I will be making this again.

My family just LOVES this recipe. We make it every winter and its just thick and hearty enough that we end up making a 24-serving version and it only lasts a few days. 

We substitute chicken, instead of ham. It's great! While its true its may not have a "Wow" factor to it, its a nice comfort food on those cold winter days, especially in a bread bowl!

If your from MN, this is very similar in taste (maybe thicker) to the MN Ren Fest version!

My version of this soup is the same except instead of almonds, I use 2 cups of diced, cooked chicken.  I love the creaminess and the added tang that the sherry gives.  Serve with crusty, fresh bread and a nice salad.

To much flour; I used wine in place of the sherry and added cayenne pepper.  It had the consistency of gravy until adding the wine and cream.

This was a delicious recipe to use up some wild rice and the 2 cups of half-and-half that was in the fridge.  I did use Genoa Salami in place of the ham.  I had it leftover from a salad and we thought it tasted great in this soup.  I didn’t measure the onions, because we like them, I just used the entire small onion.  My wild rice was already cooked as it was a side dish before going in this soup.  My guys didn’t care for the rice as a side dish, but did enjoy it in this recipe.  It was my dad’s birthday, so I took this soup, bread and ‘Strawberry Cream Pie To Die For’ from AR out to my parents house for dinner.  The end result was a nice thick chowder-like soup.  It paired nicely with ‘Pumpernickel Bread I’ another AR recipe.  I would make this recipe again.

Great soup. Have to question whether the pepper quantity is a typo.  I used half the amount and it still had a strong pepper taste.  Also, should it be tbs or tsp of garlic?
