I have been making a variant of this recipe for years, eliminating the cream cheese in the crust and using blue cheese instead. In my opinion, the crust is better without the cream cheese. I use about 2/3 cup blue cheese, cream it with the butter, add the flour and stir til it's crumbly, then add the milk. A previous rater said the crust is hard to work with. It is if you're used to bread dough and such but once you've worked with it a couple of times it becomes easier. I also add chopped ripe olives and chopped marinated artichoke hearts and chopped mushrooms to the "fillin'". I have heard some vegetarians omit the beef and use bulgur instead. Oh, and also I use the cream cheese that I didn't use in the crust in the filling. When cooled, the CC also helps the filling bind and makes it easier to shape when adding it to the crust.

This dish is a favorite with everyone I've ever made it for. Good to see it made it onto the web. I've searched for it before with no luck. 

I originally found it in an old cookbook that referred to it as a Mexican dish! Could that be? Never knew Mexican (or even Tex-Mex) to lean towards blue cheese in anything. But you never know.

The dough was a little hard to work with.  Kept falling apart.  Know I use pilsbery crescent rolls instead.  However good flavor with the blue cheese.

Delicious but very heavy and very fattening.  Terrific reheated the next day.

The flavor was great. I made 3. I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry instead which was impossible to mix with the cream cheese, spread along the bottom. Also made a vegetarian with imitation beef and that was great said my vegetarian. The flavors were terrific together.

It was OK...  I'll probably make it again but with some changes. I used Pillsbury Cresecent Rolls (2 tubes) instead of the recipe's dough, and I only baked it for about 10 minutes. Next time, I'll try using the recipe's dough, since the crescents were too hard to work with.
As for the recipe itself, very nice. I'd add more blue cheese for flavor and leave out the walnuts... don't feel like they added anything.
Also, 2 lbs made almost twics as much filling as 
I needed! I'm passing the leftovers on to my mom to mkae her own, since I don't want this 2 nights in a row!

It's Okay - we made this twice.  I don't think we will make this again.

I made some changes to this so maybe my rating isn't entirely fair.  I am notoriously bad at making pastry so I just used 2 tubes of crescent roll dough instead and  I left out the black olives and walnuts due to personal taste.  We found this to be rather salty.  I think I'll keep tinkering with this, as it wasn't bad for a first try.  Thanks!

A little dry, I would add additional sour cream or maybe some cream cheese to the meat mixture.  Also, I'd use premade crescent rolls.  I added some gravy to top it off.

I was looking for something new to make and this caught my wife's eye. I didn't have any olives so instead I put in a handful of craisins, thinking that they go with blue cheese and walnuts. Also, I had no trouble with the crust at all, and I hate making crust.  It was a hit, except it was a little salty. So the next time I make this I will make the following changes:
1-1 1/2 lb hamburger ( 1 would be good).
No added salt.
Up to 1/4 cup craisins.
Or 1 lb hamburger and 1/2 cup mixed veggies.

I've already reviewed this but added another account to post a picture of the result. I wrote that review about 11 years ago and I'm still making the Blue Cheese Beef Roll. This is from July of this year, (I'm actually making it again tonight. It's a winner.)

This sounded amazing, but turned out heavy and bland.  The problem I think is too much ground meat and too little sauce. I will try again, with 1 lb. of meat. It looks gorgeous, but we were disappointed.

Oh my goodness, this recipe was so delicious and fun to make I can't wait to try it again!  I especially loved the pastry and how easy that was to make.
