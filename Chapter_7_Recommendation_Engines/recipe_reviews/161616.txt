I liked the flavors together and this is very healthy.  I think I will like it better in the morning.  This is so much better after it sits over night.  I will add more veggies and some other spices like cilantro next time too.  Thanks for the idea, love the orange and lime together.

I really enjoyed this salad, but tweaked it just a little.  I added some diced onion along with some strawberries to compliment the lime juice.  Next time I will also add some cilantro for a little more flavor.  Great recipe for a basic salad!

This was very light and refreshing, I made it with a bag of confetti slaw (red cabbage, broccoli and carrots).  I think it will be even better tomorrow

Pretty good recipe. I used this as a slaw on shrimp tacos and it was awesome. I did amend the recipe a bit, I reduced the amount of orange juice used. I also chopped and seeded one jalopenao, added some cilantro and added 1tbsp of reduced fat sour cream. This was awesome. IT is better if you let it sit in frig for one day. Yummy.  We even had this on some veggie burgers and it was aslo good.

This was good and easy to make. I added garlic, onions and grapes. Loved the refreshing feel it brought to our dinner.

I added a small chopped onion and added 3 tbsp of mayonnaise. Substituted Pink Himalayan salt for the salt.
It wasnâ€™t my favorite, but I do like the flavor, especially since I used home grown tomatoes.
