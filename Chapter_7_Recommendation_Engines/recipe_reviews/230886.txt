I cut this recipe back to twelve servings. I did not have canola oil, I substituted vegetable oil. I also used a homemade applesauce and regular whole wheat flour as I did not have pastry flour. I used a 1/4 cup dry measuring cup to drop the batter onto my waffle iron, mine is smaller and 1/2 cup batter for each square is too much for mine. These cooked up fluffy, thick with a nice chewy interior and a crunchy outside. The flavor was amazing--I've never had waffles like this before. I served this with a homemade maple-vanilla syrup and the whole family inhaled them. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: Even halved, this made a TON of waffles. Keep that in mind when you make this, if you don't have a large family--be prepared to freeze a few.

I cut down the portions on this recipe and it still made a ton.  this seems like restaurant recipe proportions to me.  It makes a ton.  The flavor was good.  I subbed in some oatmeal for the flax since I didn't have 2 cups on hand.  These are very filling waffles. We topped them with strawberries and banana. I will file this one away.

Fantastic! Made 1/4 batch and made six large waffles. Subbed in melted coconut oil and some flax and sunflower seed. Yummy.

From the ingredient list you can tell they're healthy, and they don't nec taste so.  (Which is some times so important in a house with kids!) I halved the recipe and it made 10(!!) Belgium waffle sized waffles. I will make these again, when I run out of milk again (recipe calls for milk powder, just happened to have some on hand).

Very good! Even hubby liked them! They had a nutty taste to them-will definitely make again. Did sub egg beaters for eggs and used buttermilk in place of water.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out good! I substituted Almond flour for the wheat germ and added buttermilk powder & used milk, no water. Also added a 1/2 tsp of mixed spice I had on hand (I think itâ€™s nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice & sugar). Served topped with vanilla yogurt & fruit!

This one is a keeper! We cut it down to six servings very easily - and it made 7 waffles. Healthy and satisfying. THey even freeze well, and warm up in the toaster oven.

Made the recipe last night and it was ok.  I think the waffles are way to heavy. 
Here in Alaska we make our sour doe waffles that are light and fluffy cooked to a light golden brown.  We serve them with homemade cool whip, homemade ice cream, fresh fruits, along with local honey and syups.  My family and friends that visit from the lower 48 always want to take some 100 yr plus starter mix with them.
