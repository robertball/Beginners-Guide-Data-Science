Holy Cow ..these were delicious.  and i've made a hundred different kinds of choc chip cookie recipes.  The only change was I probably ground up more than the 4 1/2 cups of rice krispies.  I got carried away..more like 5 1/2.  You couldn't really taste the rice cereal but it enhanced the taste of the cookie into something great. Oh I did add 1 tsp of baking powder as well as the baking soda because I love my cookies nice and puffy.  GREAT SHARE!

Delicious.  The ground up Rice Krispies add a delicious flavor and with having to use less flour compared with other recipes the cookies don't taste as doughy and have a richer flavor

These were wonderful.  The cookies I get at the bakery are good but these are much better. They're the best tasting chocolate chip cookies I've ever had.  I know some people have said the Rice Krispies give the cookies an odd crunch but apparently they're not grinding up the Rice Krispies fine enough.  The cereal should be ground down to the consistancy of a fine ground cornmeal.  It's the flavor of the Rice Krispies that makes these cookies so wonderful, not the crunch.  The type of cookie sheet you have will determine how long you need to bake them.  I have shiny restaurant quality heavyweight baking pans and it took 13 to 14 minutes for the cookies to get done.  Darker and lightweight pans will probably require less time, maybe 10-12 minutes.

Great cookies!  I added the whole four crushed cups of crispy rice and left some uncrushed for an extra crunch.  The cookies were soft in the middle and crunchy on the ends.  Everyone loved them, and my daughter was mad when they were all gone.

The flavor was good, I liked the crunch from the rice krispies, did not like that they baked to a thin cookie.  I even refrigerated the cookie dough in an attempt to stop them from spreading out, it didn't help much.  I probably won't make these again as I like a thicker chocolate chip cookie.

We enjoyed these. I had some Rice Krispies that needed to be used, so it was perfect. It makes them a bit sweet for me, but I really like the texture it gives them. My middle son thought they had oatmeal in them. I used a package of Peanut Butter/Semi-Sweet chips. Thanks!

I took someone's advice and left a cup of rice krispies uncrushed and baked it.. it left chewy bits in the cookies.. that were kinda undesirable.  it did not come out thin and krispy like others had stated .. but the down side was that i had to  bake it a bit longer like about 11 to 14 minutes .. cause it was raw on the inside.  also i didnt think that the  sheet pan on the bottom helped..it didnt help

THis was a big hit for Christmas one year.  I thought they were great and the rice crispies gave it a good flavor and a neat texture.  It was kind of messy to make but delicious!

I happen to like my cookies dense and chewy ... unfortunately these were neither so I didn't care for them.  However my son and dh liked them so we're giving them 4 stars.

Great! These are fabulous, however I did make a few changes. I added chopped dark chocolate chunks and instead of using a food processor I used potato masher for the cereal! I wanted some chunky pieces in the cookies. I also added more than a cup of rice crispies, in fact I used most of it. They were fabulous! I also like my cookies a bit saltier, so I tend to increase the salt. Thanks!

Great!  The texture is perfect, slightly crispy and yet soft.  The 4 1/2 cups of crispy rice yielded more than a cup of ground powdered cereal.  For me, it made 4 dozen cookies.

These cookies are very well thought of at our house, favorites of my roommates and our friends. None of them were able to figure out the secret ingredient until I told them, and they all love it.

I was going to give this 1 star, but my husband ate one and asked what the big problem was. I've never made cookies and thrown away raw dough, but I did on this recipe. The texture is not enjoyable (and I bake other cookie recipes with rice krispies in them), and they flattened out despite several efforts to keep them from doing so. Too bad.

We have been adding rice cereal to our tollhouse cookies for my entire life (>30 years) but we don't crush them - leaving them whole makes for a great cookie crunch

I really like the taste of this cookie, it is soft yet crispy at the same time. I just wish it was "puffy" and had more body to it (then I would give it a 5). I read someone's note that mentioned adding baking powder, I might try that next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe :-)

Very nice Variation, probably could reduce salt by half as rice cereal contains salt and wife found it a bit salty.

I was hoping for a chocolate chip cookie with crispy rice that you hear when you bite into the cookie.  There is a bakery near my job that makes them like that.  These are chewy but lack what I am seeking.  Thanks for the posting anyways.

Excellent! If you love Choc. Chip cookies without nuts and coconut this is the one for you. Delicious and soft in the middle with the  unexpected crunch of the krispie rice. I only  crushed the cereal by hand and it was perfect.

These cookies are good and always disappear fast.  I regularly use this recipe to get rid of old breakfast cereal.  I have used every cereal you can image as a substitution for the rice krispies.  Also, I have always just crushed the cereal rather than put it in the blender.

Just made these....so yummy. They were a little flat for my taste but the flavor was good. I also added more crispy rice as someone else suggested; however, that just made the cookies have chewy (and not the good kind) of texture. Oh well, I would make these again.

Made according to recipe - oh so good!! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!! But... I was jonesing for really chocolaty choc choc chip cookies. So, I used "Cocoa Crispees" and added 1/2C "Hershey's Special Dark" cocoa powder. I only had dark brown sugar so I omitted the white sugar and doubled the brown sugar... and only had butter-flavored shortening (no unsalted butter for baking) so I used 1C shortening w/o added water. I also tripled the vanilla - 1tbl. I do this standard. The Cookies are sooooooo good! I rolled 1 tbl+/- balls in powdered sugar and placed them onto an ungreased cookie sheet, baked for 5 min rotated and baked for 5 more.

I didn't like these at all.  The rice crispies gave it a funny taste.  I will keep looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I made these cookies and while they were good, I don't think I'll make them again.  They tasted a lot like traditional chocolate chip cookies, but the texture is not something I could get used to.

I thought these tasted very good. However, the cookies were too thin for my liking, and I found the texture a bit strange. Perhaps it's because I kept the rice krispies whole.

Although this wasn't my favorite at first, it's the one I keep going back to...and besides, each time I make it people always love 'em and ask for the recipe! It has a really unexpected crunch that totally adds to these cookies' draw!

These were great!  My husband really likes them.  I used KIX cereal, because the kids wouldn't eat it, and I saw that someone said they had used every type of cereal with this recipe.  They seem to cook faster than normal toll house, so watch the timer.  Mine were perfectly done in 8-10 mins.  I will be making these alot!

Oh baby, give these a try because they really rock! I used big chunk chocolate pieces in lieu of chips and kept the rice krispies whole. You're too cool for school Dave and from me and my family, we thank you for a great recipe!!!!

These were very good. A thin cookie with an unusual taste/texture, but a nice crispy outside and a moist & chewy center. Something quite different, but nice.

These were good, but I've had better.  The rice crispies did add crunch, but I don't think I liked it any better than normal choc. chip cookies.  I don't know if I'll be making these again.  Thanks David!

This recipe is mere perfection! Sad enough I did not have rice cereal mentioned.  I used Dora Explore cereal. I blended it into a powder; then ran it through a sifter.  I added 1 cup more cereal than mentioned. + added 1T more vanilla.  And i only had white chocolate chips. If only I had the proper cereal!! You should put these on the market!! I can't wait to make them again.  Thanks a bunch!

If you like crispy outside ,and soft ,slightly chewy inside kinda cookie, you'll definitely gonna love this one. These are really goooood! The only thing I change is the amount of white sugar .. I reduced it to 2/4 cup instead of 3. I couldn't stop eating them. It was a BIG hit at my 9year old son's class party! Thank you JDSIMON for making my son very popular!

Different but I liked them. I kept thinking there were itty bitty teeny tiny bits of toffee in the cookies. I did go scant on sugar and 1.5 of chips.

Fantastic. The consistency of the ground rice krispies is a little off but these cookies taste great!

i love this recipe!  the rice krispie cereal add "just the touch"! soft and chewy and the surprise ingredient is just right!  i actually didn't grind up the rice krispies to give it a little more texture and they still turned out great!

sorry dave, I did not enjoy these cookies I found they had far to many chocolate chips in them and did not holdtogether well at all.
