This is good; it just isn't quite what I was looking for as a dip for apples. I was hoping it would be a little creamier with the cream cheese. I used it as a spread for a toasted bagel and enjoyed it that way.

I doubled the cream cheese and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  This was fluffy and I could eat it by itself, but it was especially good as a dip for apples and graham crackers.
