I love sugar snap peas and this was definitely a nice light salad!  I didn't use the radishes (just a personal preference) so I subbed a bit of thinly sliced red onion.  I also cut the cucumber that way and since Crisco now has an olive oil I used that along with the rice wine vinegar which provided just the right amount of sweet and tart.  The toasted sesame seeds were a nice touch - very healthy and very good!

I served this for a luncheon with a friend.  It was light and delicious.  I added a few thinly cut red onions too.  Made it again that night for my daughter.

I did not have any radishes on hand, so I used red onion instead. I would also use sesame oil in this next time since it pairs well with all of the other ingredients.

I made this as directed. It was good, but missing something. The toasted sesame seeds were really the only thing adding much flavor; the dressing was nice and light but lacked "oomph." I think the previous reviewers who added red onion were onto something...that might help a bit. Either way, I liked it, and would make it again when I have sugar snap peas to use up. Thanks!

So realized only after I began prepping that I had some kind of pole bean and not sugar snap peas, but I used them anyway, and this salad came out great! I did add a bit of chopped arugula I needed to use up and a big handful of cilantro, which really complimented the cucumber.

This salad is great. I used olive oil & red wine for the dressing. It flew out of the bowl.

I'd give it 4.5 stars - it's a pretty salad to serve with Asian-flavoured BBQ.  The toasted sesame seeds are a must, and I would add a teaspoon of sesame oil to enhance the flavour.

I used a peeled regular cuke and added a scallion. I will add a little sugar and sesame oil next time.
