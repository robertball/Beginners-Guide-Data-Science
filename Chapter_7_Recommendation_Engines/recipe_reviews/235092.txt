I absolutely love this recipe! The second time I made it I used a little less teriyaki sauce, other than that wonderful!

This was really tasty.  We used no oil, a splash of sesame vinegar, and aminos instead of soy.  Had a great taste and caramelized nicely!

Really enjoyed this. I changed nothing but added my marinated chicken thighs cut up in bite size pieces. I’d serve it over plain jasmine rice. I would also think this would be awesome grilled in a basket, charred just right.

These were so easy to make  and very tasty. They stayed moist with a nice crunch on the outside. I will definitely make these again.  I did not make any adjustments to the recipe.

Really good!  A nice way to prepare Brussels sprouts.  It's nice to find some different ways to prepare them, half the people in our house love them and the others are indifferent, so this made a nice change.

This just wasn't us.  We like brussel sprouts a lot and love them sauted, but the different flavors in this recipe just didn't come together for us.

I used only olive oil since I didnt have sesame oil and coarse cracked pepper it was great.  The second time, I used lite soy, and cooked chopped bacon tossed in with some dried cranberries. (trying to mimick a restaurant appetizer that I loved).  Also turned out wonderful.
