made this for dinner tonight. Hubby only gave it 3 stars. I thought it was okay, but the ketchup overpowered the cranberry sauce. Maybe if it was 1/4 ketchup to 3/4 cranberry sauce it would be better. If you are a big lover of ketchup, you might like this!

Me and my family tried this recipe and it was amazing. We had to subsitute ground cinnamon for allspice. We also added in a tablespoon more of cranberry sauce. All and all the add ins made the dish even better. I would highly recommend it.

YUCK!!!  Blech! Way to much ketchup. One star only because none isn't an option.

This is a favourite in my family.  I use more cranberry sauce than the recipe calls for as my daughter likes the extra sauce.  I do not use a 1:1 ratio for the cranberry and ketchup as the ketchup overpowers the cranberry taste.
