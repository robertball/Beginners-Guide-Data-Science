There are so many versions of this cookie. The trick to avoid the chewy center is to turn the oven off and keep them in the oven for a couple of more hours. These are also called "overnght cookies" because you can preheat the oven at 350 deg., then shut it off, put in the cookies, and keep them in overnight. I sprayed my cookie sheets with generic pam and they slid off.

This is a very good recipe. One reviewer had trouble, but I think it was her technique, or possibly the weather! Meringues are sometimes difficult to do. Some tips: 1) never use a plastic bowl to mix in, 2) be sure there's no oil or butter (or shortening, etc) on your utensils or bowl, 3) as the recipe says, be sure the egg whites are VERY firm before you start adding sugar, and don't stop beating the sugar/eggwhites until you can make peaks that don't fall down, 4) if you just can't get good peaks, it may be too humid in your house--put your merigue on a pie & try the cookies another day. I like to make these cookies in the evening. You can preheat your oven to 275, put the cookies in, turn the oven OFF, and leave them until morning! They'll be perfectly cooked. :o)

I made these cookies and they were wonderful! I added one packet of raspberry jello mix to the recipe so they turned out pink and had a hint of raspberry flavoring!these cookies are a great summer treat!

Wow!!  This was my first time making meringues, as they always kind of intimidated me before.  But the recipe was SO easy, and the cookies turned out *perfect*!!  I tripled the recipe except for the chocolate chips (only put in a cup and a half).  They really are just the right amount crisp and chewy.

You must beat the egg whites for a long time, until they produce stiff peaks and turn glossy.  But bake these with confidence -- you won't be disappointed!  Thanks for sharing, Pat K.!

These cookies came out great!  Parchment paper was no problem at all!  My only dilemma was telling if they were done or not.  I actually baked these cookies for 30-35 minutes because the first batch at 25 minutes (recommended by author)still seemed gooey inside.  I know they should be somewhat chewy, but they were a bit too moist still.

My boyfriend told me he had this cookie just once or twice, but they were always his favorites, so I decided to make them one day.  I'd actually tried once before, but they didn't turn out right, so I was a little nervous to try again.  It turns out that you have to beat them after you put the sugar in, too!  My mom told me that, after a bit of a giggle.  After I remade them and beat them til they were very stiff with the sugar in it, they came out perfect.

I tried this recipe TWICE but to no avail!  I don't know what the problem is.  The first time, when I added the sugar after beating the whites, the batter became as creamy as pancake batter! It was useless.  I cooked it anyway and scraped off what I could.  The 2nd time, I VERY CAREFULLY added the sugar, and it did get visibly more creamy, but at least I could spoon it on the baking sheet.  However they stuck to the baking sheet like there was no tomorrow.  I use non-stick cookware too.  I wasn't sure if I should spray the pan first or not, but since the recipe didn't call for it, I didn't do it.  Two strikes is an 'out' for me!

I'm pretty sure the reviewer had a problem because you specified "white sugar" which she interpreted as "confectioner's sugar" instead of "granulated sugar".  Use granulated sugar in this recipe and it is perfect.

These look great but are very very sweet - I think the sugar could be cut a bit.  Also - I spooned the merangue into a ziplock bag, cut the corner and was able to drop the cookies onto the sheet like a pastry bag - they came out in perfect little swirls.  I topped them with little non-pareil beads.

This is the exact recipe I've been using since 7th grade taught to me by a teacher in the late 60's.  We were told we could use brown paper bags cut to the size of the cookie sheet.  These are cookies that should be made very small about 1/2 tsp of batter, they will cook up great at 325 for 25 mins.  This is a recipe I wouldn't give up for anything and always get great comments as well as people who want it.  Always been happy to share it.  It has served me well over these 40+ year.  ENJOY

Dang! I didn't do it right. I love these cookies but next time, I will FOLLOW directions!  I used eggwhites in a carton for starters, then, Spenda instead of sugar.  It looked as if they would turn out, but they are too chewy.  Great recipe, I will try again!!!

These were delicious. I love meringue cookies. I did omit the chocolate chips as I like my cookies plain. They were light and crisp on the outside and soft inside and melted in your mouth. I have added a very small amount of peppermint extract in the past... also delicious (would be great with the chocolate chips)

If you do not have parchment paper, you can use plain brown paper cut out of grocery bags. Also, mini chips work best.

This recipe was very very good! It made around 40 for me. I also used mini choco. chips and found that a whole cup was too many for the standard recipe.  After being in the oven 20 min at 300 I just turned it off and they were perfectly cooked! Clean up was so easy just put hot soapy water in your bowl and wait around 2 min. When you pour it all out all the goup is gone! I will definitly make this recipe again and again!

I like this recipe because it is easy, but my cookies were to chewy in the middle.  I thought they were done because they were golden brown.

Great recipe, but do use parchment paper and you will have no problems getting the cookies off. Used mini choc chips. Talk about melt in your mouth cookies! Thanks so much!

My Mom made these when I was a kid and I loved them.  I finally found a recipe that taste just like hers!  Instead of chocolate chips, I put a half a pecan on top of each one, or you can mix in chopped pecans into the mixture.  I have a question though.  It says they are 119 calories per serving, but how much is in a serving?  Appreciate any comments.

Easy and traditional meringue cookie.  I had 6 egg whites left over from another recipe, so made a triple batch!  This made ALOT of cookies!  I did follow other reviewers and left them in the oven turned off after baking time was done for an additional 30 min.  Then removed them to a cooling rack.  They were crisp and melt in your mouth.  My daughter took some to a friend's house who had never had meringue cookies, she said they were skeptical, but after tasting, ate the whole plateful!  Oh ya, made them without chocolate chips.

This recipe is the same as one that I have been making for years but I bake them at 250F for 40 minutes.  The cookies are a favourite in our house (save for my husband who called them 'chalk' cookies).  It is best to start with room temperature eggs and they are hard to make on humid days.

If you have trouble making you meringues work,its usually grease on your utensils. To fix this rub lemon juice all over them,and always use a metal bowl.you don't even need to clean the lemon juice off.quick and easy :)

I made these hoping they would be what I had before. I really enjoyed them, but I had a few problems. The baking was off and my cookies were either hollow on and fell a part or they were too moist. I am not sure what I did wrong..but none the less, they are worth trying.

This is the same recipe that I've been using for 40 years. I used brown paper bags today, as my original recipe called for, but parchment works well, also. Maybe next time I'll try my silicone baking sheet. I used mini chips.  I think they mix in with the meringue better.

I used this recipe but I went with the longer cook time by preheating the oven to 350 and then turning off the oven when I put the cookies in the oven for four hours. They came out brilliantly. The only gooey part is the chocolate chips.

for those of you having problems with too much gooey-ness on the inside.  I think they should be left in the oven for 15 minutes after you turn the oven off.  A bit of mint flavoring is also nice in this cookie.

I'm sure this would be a great recipe, but I think I did something wrong. All I came up with was a cup of multi-colored slime. My friend actually liked it and called it "Rainbow Gunk". Again, I'm pretty sure I did something wrong

My grandmother's were the best so tonight I attempted making them. I wanted cookies and had no butter in the house sounds perfect. They weren't like grandma's. My daughter complained the house smelled eggy and her facial expression to the first bite were disappointing. It's a fail for me!

I made these for a friend who had been asking for them for a long time. They turned out great, although I thought they were a little too sweet, but she said they were exactly like she remembered having as a kid, so a big thumbs up!!

Recipe was easy to follow and they turned out great. Also looked to other comments about adding in a jello packet for flavoring (yum!) as well as turning the oven off and leaving them in there for a while after to make sure there wasn't a sticky center. Will be adding to my list of "family" recipes.

I was really skeptical about these because of the such small amount of ingredients, but these were perfect and very easy to make! I prefer these cookies much over the store boughten kind.

Mixed these in my Ninja blender using small pitcher, paddle, and lowest setting. After stiff peaks, poured sugar through spout while beating. Then turned out into bowl and folded in chips. Note these are extremely sweet, and I used less sugar and fewer chips than the recipe called for. You can go with half. I also let the egg whites reach room temp before beating. Baked at stated time for 25 mins, then turned off oven and let sit another 10. Perfect. I live in northeast and it's cold here so no humidity problems.

These are good. I should've beat them a little longer, and it is taking the "sit in the warm oven for overnight" note, cause they have too much of a moist middle, which is not as dry as they are supposed to be.

My family loves these.  Bake on parchment and there will be no sticking. Watch the time they should not be brown. They do not keep for more than 1 or two days, that is if there is any left.

I've made meringue cookies A LOT but always did the overnight method of baking. I love this method so much more! Hot out of the oven meringues... they melt in your mouth! Plus the joy of eating them 25 minutes after mixing can't be beat.  I didn't put any chocolate chips in, they were delicious without them. Used a melon-baller to drop them onto parchment paper on an airbake cookie sheet. Oh a tip for meringues - use a clean metal bowl but wipe it down with a little apple cider vinegar to make sure it's grease-free before mixing. I grew up watching my mom do that and have always done the same - have never had a meringue not turn out. Don't make them when it's raining, either.

Just made these for the first time and they came out great. The key is to beat the egg whites on high for about 15 minutes....I know it sounds like a long time but if you don't get really stiff white peeks the batter will be runny! Came out so yummy!

These cookies have become a staple in our home. I make them once or twice weekly and they go quick for both adults and kids. These are also a great low-fat snack (we are doing Weight Watchers and they are less than 1/2 a point each)! I leave them in the oven with it turned off as another reviewer suggested for about an hour or two and they come out perfect every time!

Good recipe. Some helpful hints. Grease cookie sheets then lay either parchment paper or cut to fit brown grocery bag type paper and spray the paper with cooking spray.  Use the mini chocolate chips for these cookies.  Do not make on a humid day.

Love it! These are amazing, and taste remarkably like marshmallows. I'm only 12 years old, so that just counts for how simple these are! I love to bake, though, and I do at least once a week, so maybe not every kid could make them. Anyway, if you have no cream of tartar, for every eighth teaspoon you can add a half teaspoon of lemon juice. It actually improves the flavor! Besides that, I just have two suggestions:

1) Blend the granulated sugar in a food processor before adding it to the other ingredients, and add it VERY slowly, just a tablespoon at a time, or you will have grainy meringues. Mix for a LONG time after adding the sugar!

2) If you like them to be crispy all the way through, let them sit in the oven, turned off. Leave them for a few hours or overnight. Personally,  I like to just eat them straight out of the oven. The chewy center makes them even more marshmallow-like. 

If they look small on the pan before they are baked, don't worry! They will puff up in the oven! I would definitely recommend these! I am 100 percent making them again!

I had no problem with them sticking because I used Parchment paper, they slid right off. The only thing I did differently then the recipe is add Andes mint morsels instead of regular chocolate chips. They were the hit of the holidays!!! I will definitely make them again!!

Make these every year, just love them! Instead of chocolate chips I use hershey kisses, just place one on top of each cookie, cover with the surrounding meringue, and sprinkle with red and green sugar. So good!

Great recipe, but don't make the mistake I did - tripling the batch because I had some egg whites to use up and them realize you don't have the oven space too cook all of them at once! This recipe really does work best if you put the cookies in and the turn the oven off and leave the cookies in there for several hours. Trying to fit four trays of cookies into my single oven didn't work well. I finagled it by turning sauce pans over so I could stack two trays per oven rack, but definitely not ideal! Cookies turned out okay anyway. I leave out the chocolate chips and use a little mint extract to cut the sweetness.

i love this recipe. i tried it because i was making another cookie that requires 12 egg yokes and I did not want to waste the egg whites. i will definitely make these again. i agree with the one reviewer the sugar should be cut down a bit.

Very good recipe! This recipe was simple, but so good. I made the cookies without the chcolate because 1 ) I didnt want anyone chocolate chips on them , 2) i didnt have and 3) I thought it would make them sink in. So i left them plain. Luckly for me, it was a VERY hot and dry day so they turned out great. The only thing you need to remember is dont use a greasy bowl ( plastic or any bowl with oil or butter .. etc ) and whip them long enough so u get very strong peaks ( or hard peeks ) You may want to look it up. Also, like i said before , try to make them when its dry outside, so no rain, if you really need them and it's rainy or humid, then just try to turn down the temp, to cool down the house. But overall, very good and I would make them again .
tip: this makes A LOT of cookies so don't double or triple unless u REALLY need THAT much.. but great job!! :)

Great recipe!  I also had to cook mine a little longer (35ish minutes), but maybe I made them too large?  I love meringue cookie recipes that allow me to make more than one batch in a night rather than having to wait a long time in the oven, so I was pleased with this one!  :o)

A standard meringue cookie recipe, with pretty good results.  I did turn off the oven and leave the cookies in the oven for another hour or so, until they were crispy all the way through.  They were a little sweet, but that's how I like them, so it worked out.

I've never had a meringue before so im not sure if I made these right. I followed the directions to a T and in the end the middles were still soft after 35 minutes of baking. I added cherry flavored kool-aid mix, the kind that you just add water to, to the batter for color and flavor. They taste okay, but these remind me too much of marshmallows to enjoy them. I will have to buy a meringue next time I go to the store to compare.

The cookie's texture was good, but I thought they were way too sweet! I'd recommend using 1/2 cup of sugar rather than 3/4 cup. Otherwise, this is an easy recipe for meringue cookies.

These are good and went over really well at work! I liked them, but they seemed a tad bit chewy. Maybe they're supposed to be like that, but that's not how I remembered them as a kid. BUT still very good!!!!

Easily best cookies I’ve ever had. My 10 year old cousins came up from Florida to Baltimore last month. We hadn’t seen them in 3 years, as they live so far away. They made me signs about the cookies I made from when they were 7 years old. I had to make them, and my cousins were so happy. 100% will recommend.

I just pulled my cookies out of the oven and they are still quite chewy in the middle.  I just put my second batch in but when they are done I am gonna slip the first batch back in the oven, turn it off, and leave them for the night.  I'm sure they will be perfect in the morning!  I took a picture and there are some empty spots on the pan.....I ate those, chewy center and all! So yummy!!!!

Love these!!  Made them for Christmas. Just omitted the chocolate chips and added sprinkles before baking. Piped them on the parchment and baked for only 20 minutes, shut off the oven and let them sit for an hour before I took them out. Perfection. And they're so beautiful and festive!

The first time I made it, the whites formed thick peaks, but when I added the sugar, it turned thinner like pancake batter.  The cookies tasted fine, but were  flat and a bit wet/sticky on the inside.
This time (the second time), I let the egg whites warm to room temperature,  and I added the sugar to the whipped foam one tablespoon at a time.  The beating/whipping took a long time, but the batter stayed thick.  
I lowered the oven temperature to 200, instead of 300 degrees.  I baked with the door closed for about 3 hours.  Then, I turned the oven off and let the cookies sit in the oven for another hour (for safe measure).  We live in a humid environment and I feel the lower temperature and longer bake time helped the cookies have that very crisp texture.  They also stayed whiter versus a browned "marshmallow" tint of my first batch.
I love them!  Next time I will try to add flavored jello to the batch.

Horrible recipe!  The video is great but something is clearly wrong with the oven temp and time.  The video says 200 for 3 hours and the recipe says 300 for 25 min.  If I had followed the video I might not have wasted so much time and ingredients.

This was super easy. I made them into bones for Halloween by  using a Ziploc bag with the corner cut out and shaping the bones on a parchment covered cookie sheet. Great cookie for toddlers because it melts in their mouth. No choking, great for my little ones who come for home made trick or treats!!!!!

I didn't use cream of tartar.  Didn't need to.  I taste tasted before baking, I had everything perfect, I lightly folded in coloring to get the swirl effect on them. My oven is different, but I did mine at a lower temperature for longer.  That's the big part is making sure you've completely dried them out in the oven,  assuming you got the rest right.  Cream of tartar is just for structure. You can use lemon juice a few drops only.

This is my favorite cookie of ALL TIME! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING TO IT IS PERFECT! The only thing you might change is when your doubling the batch keep the same amount of chocolate chips. If I could I would rate this recipe 10/5. Everyone loves it!

While wishing eggs to stiff peaks is a pain. These are my favorite cookies ever. 
And the tips in the comments section is what has helped me make these successfully.

When making this recipe I realized that they only said to use "white sugar". Did they mean powdered or granulated. I used granulated. This made the batter turn out just fine, but when baking them, they turned out more like burnt sugar (or of a caramel taste) then a solid white cookie. I think this was because the given temperature is to low and it says to bake for to long. Over all I would definitely like to try this recipe again and I recommend for people to try it. The cookies that turned out also did not taste to bad.

Great recipe, though I subbed the vanilla for raspberry and forewent the chocolate chips. The only thing is that it calls for too high a temperature, so the meringue all settled at the bottom of the cookie and was a lot denser than it should be (I've made these before with a different temp and cooking time). It should be baked around 225-250 for about 2 or 3 hours, then turn off the oven and let them dry out a bit so they're not too chewy.

The cookies themselves turned out but primarily because I read the other reviews and other meringue recipes to get full instructions. 1) you need to incorporate the sugar when its still liquid so the sugar dissolves, but once its quite thick liquid  because otherwise the peaks won't form. 2) The temperature was too high, and the length of time was too short for what was needed. It’s dry winter and I required close to 90 min for them to cook at 300, then they almost burnt. They are done when they are crispy (and pretty much shatter to touch) throughout- it should not be tacky/sticky at all go low and slow 3)  As others warned, I'd half the vanilla far too overpowering. My husband who loves marshmallow anything loved these, I didn't care for them and will keep searching for recipes.

I love meringue cookies, and everything went according to plan, but i might do half the amount of vanilla it suggests next time. Unless you like the strong vanilla flavor, I'd half it.

i made them to a T. No modifications. It like the previous reviewer, it came out like pancake batter. I've made meringues before, these are the only ones to not turn out for me. Not sure where I went wrong, but I'll stick to my other recipes!

I made this with a lemon version substituting lemon juice for cream of tartar and added one teaspoon of grated lemon rind. It was perfect... the shell was solid but feather light when you bite into it and the center is marshmallow gooey. Next time I make a flan and have all those left over egg whites, I'm making meringue cookies again.

I tried this recipe many times, with and without chocolate chips. The childcare chip ones weren't as good, and looked awful sense you couldn't pipe them easily. I would suggest just leaving them out all together. They still taste fine and look amazing!

I make these very often. They are the best dessert/snack.
I find it works better if you double the ingredients.
If you are having trouble with consistency try doubling it.

I had made something else requiring egg yolks and had two egg whites leftover.....I hate wasting anything! I found this recipe and the only change I made was using lemon juice instead of cream of tartar since I didn't have any (1 teaspoon lemon juice per egg white). These were so good. I used chocolate chips and tried to put it through a pastry bag but all the chips bunched up and clogged the end and I had to just mound by spoonfuls onto the baking  sheet. I will try mini chips next time.

Pretty solid meringue recipe! I substituted a teaspoon of lemon juice for the cream of tartar and added a few drops of almond extract to try to bump up the flavor. If I was to make this again I would do a little more to get more flavor since they are pretty plain. However, they are just the thing I needed since I'm baking for a friend with a gluten and dairy allergy.

This was the easiest dessert ever and can be whipped up with things we all keep around.  I would use a bit less chocolate chips but other than that they were perfect (it was really good same day but 1-2 days later better cooked through). If you like them a little chewy in the middle bake as is. Next time I'll try the other reviewers tip and keep them in the oven once turned off to get them cooked all the way through.

Lovely recipe! I didn't have paper or a silicone mat for the pan so I heavily greased it with butter.  They came off with ease so I recommend it as a substitute.

I've made these for years, using chocolate chips.  I have pastel M&Ms that I'm going to use tonight.  As for the girl who had issues, I can't imagine what would be the problem unless she didn't have her speed high enough, her bowl or beaters had oil in/on them?  I saw on TV if it's rainy/humid when you try to make a meringue, add cornstarch (I saw that on the Chew).  Also make sure ALL of your sugar is dissolved (rub some meringue between your fingers....if it's grainy, you're going to have a weepy meringue.

I added some food coloring to make them more fun, I also left out the chocolate chips, as I like my meringues without them. I made them a bit bigger than what the recipes called for, so I cooked them for longer as well. I used a ziplock bag as a piping bag and made them look like little kisses. All in all, this recipe was amazing 10/10 would make them again.

Doubled the recipe as stated in the top, but if I make them again I would use a lot less sugar and half the extract... they were overpoweringly sweet.

Too much vanilla extract, it overpowered the taste buds. I'd cut it in half, or not add it in next time. I also baked them at 225 for an hour and a half, and turned the oven off and left them in there for another hour.

I made a double batch. Half with vanilla, half with almond extract. I preferred the almond, personally. Mine also came out still soft in the middle, so I just put them back in a 200 degree oven until the rest of the moisture evaporated out.

Fabulous! I used almond extract in place of the vanilla and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Xylitol. YUMMY!

Not what I was hoping for. I was hoping for firm crispy meringues and essentially I got baked marshmallows. I even baked them for 30 instead of the recommended 25 minutes. Did I need to bake them even longer? While they still taste decent and not a total waste of 8 egg whites, not quite what I was expecting. I also substituted the 1/8 tsp cream of tartar with 1/4 tsp lemon juice and it seemed to have worked!

Made these and they make way more then 12 and making only 12 makes for huge gummy cookies. I recommend adding a flavor like almond rather then vanilla unless you plan to make them into cups to hold fresh fruit. I recommend parchment paper.

The cookies tasted great but I had a very hard time getting the cookies off the cookie sheet, (and I have a stone one.) Then for the next batch I put down paper for and they still would not come up.
