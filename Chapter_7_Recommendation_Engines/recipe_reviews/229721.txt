I got the messurements for the instant coffee mixed up, but I made a second serving and just didn't add more coffee, and it's great! Thanks!

The flavor was more “cafe” and less “mocha” so I ended up adding more of the cocoa mix and even a little malted mix to achieve what I was looking for.  Could just be a taste preference on my part or what flavors you're really looking for, but this didn’t work for me and I have several similar mixes that suit me better.  Thanks bdelightful for sharing your recipe.
