Not very good. I had to add chipotle and cumin to give it flavor. The yogurt is a weird flavor with the red pepper.

very easy to make and tastes great! nice and light. i added the ingredients into a blender and instead of the chiles i added whole chili peppers and two cloves of garlic. it added a nice kick to it!

This came out really soupy. Next time I might use less yogurt - I couldn't find 8oz containers so I just measured it out from a bigger container. I added chili powder - this kept it from being overly bland - and I used lots of garlic powder instead of a clove.
