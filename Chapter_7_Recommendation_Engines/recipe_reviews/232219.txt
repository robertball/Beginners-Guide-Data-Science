Very tasty and pretty easy to make.  However, after all the sitting in the fridge and cooking it was extremely watery.  Not sure if this was just the milk, or we cooked the pasta a bit too much, or what, but next time I may cook the pasta less and maybe add less milk.

This was super salty, perhaps because of the salt from the ham plus that of the condensed soup.

We enjoyed this dish, pretty tasty with simple ingredients you most likely have in your pantry already. I did not  refrigerate 24 hours, only about 6 and it baked up fine. I would suggest letting this sit 5-10 minutes before, serving so it won't be watery.

This is delicious!  Only change is the cooking time.  I found the sauce was too saucy so I cooked it till it was more absorbed which ended up being close to 2 hours.  Plus I like it good and hot.  (I had started off with it cold from sitting in the fridge which might have made some difference).  Will make again for sure!

This casserole is yummy. I added crushed corn chips on top which added some crunch and flavor.
