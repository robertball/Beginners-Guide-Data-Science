I love this recipe, I originally tried it because I don;t like mushroom soup which most greenbean recipies call for.  The cheesy green beans are really good, even for leftovers.  I use fresh green beans and I cook them down to where they are soft before baking them in the casserole, they have lots of good flavor and are a must at our holiday table.  The only change I make is I line the bottom of the dish with the fried onions and then top with them as well to add a bit more flavor.  Besides you can never have too many fried onions!

This is very similar to a recipe I've used for years. Instead of cajun seasoning, I use Ro-tel tomatoes. Any brand of diced tomatoes with green chiles will do.

I don't even know what to say about this except that if my wife didn't stop me, I would have eaten it all.  I will hold off on the salt next time b/c between the the canned green beans, cheese, soup, and onions there was plenty.  This is comfort food at it's best!

this was ok.  I usually make green bean casserole with cream of mushroom soup and it turns out WAY better but this was ok.

Love this recipe!! I leave out the salt because I use Zatarain's Creole Seasoning and it is salty enough!  I use 3 cans of green beans instead of 2, it was just too cheeses the first time! We have this at least once a month!! Sometimes I use French cut green beans just to change it a little.

This was pretty good. Mine came out just a little watery though..but still good. I think I will add a different cheese or mix up some cheeses and omit the cream of chicken. I also added some bacon bits to the green beans. Pretty darn good.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved.  I didn't use any Cajun seasoning and added in some garlic powder, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Super easy to make, and most people said it was their favorite dish on the table.

LOVED this recipe and will for sure be making it again.  I did take other suggestions in that I did not include the salt as there is enough in the soup, cheese, green beans and Cajun seasoning.  I also used another suggestion by putting half of the French-fried onions in the bottom of the dish and sprinkled the rest on top.  I doubled this recipe and baked it in a 9X13 glass dish for 25 minutes.  Thank you HEATHERWIDNER for submitting this wonderful recipe; I now have a new recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Yum!!!!!!!

I made this according to the directions and it was very runny. It tasted ok, but I prefer the traditional green bean casserole to this. I will not be making this again.

I tried this recipe for family who do not like mushroom soup.  Then instead of processed cheese I added cream cheese and about a cup and a half of shredded cheddar.  I used frozen fine French green beans.  There was not a drizzle of sauce, nor a bean nor an onion left in the pan.  Very good!

My husband and I loved this recipe. He always wants green bean casserole and I never eat it because I don't like cream of mushroom soup and onions. I just replace the fried onions with a simple mixture of saltines and melted butter on top. I will make this recipe again

Loved the recipe!!  I doubled the recipe because we had a big Thanksgiving group.  If you double it, I would recommend a tad less on the Cajun seasoning and a tad less of the cheese, rather than the full doubled amount.  Otherwise great!!

We have always had the same old green bean casserole everybody uses. I decided to try this for a change--it was wonderful.  I used the "healthier" versions of the soup and cheese and it tasted great. I think that made it a little bit runnier, though.  I omitted the salt--most Cajun seasonings have salt anyway.  I thoroughly understand the reviewer who said his wife had to make him stop eating! Same with us! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I just got done eating it and the taste was very good! I changed things a little as I was trying to find a recipe to add cubed turkey meat to, and I had all of the other ingredients for.  So, I added 2 cups of the cubed turkey when I stirred it all together.  I did not add the additional salt as per recipe and it was just fine without.  It was too runny for my liking, so next time I will add a cup of cooked rice or another can of beans.  Good recipe!

My husband LOVES Velveeta so this looked like a promising recipe. I used a can of cream of celery soup to make the recipe vegetarian. I also didn't have enough fresh green beans so I used half fresh and half canned. I prefer the fresh green beans for next time. Turned out great, but this is probably the richest green bean casserole I've made.

We love this recipe!!! It has replaced our "traditional" green bean casserole recipes. I left out the salt and used the Velveeta queso blanco cheese for additional "kick". Also added just a touch of milk because I thought it a little thick. It tasted great and shared the recipe with many friends as they loved it too. It is now our green bean casserole "go to" recipe for all special occasions!!!

I followed a previous review and omitted the cajun seasoning for a drained can of rotel and used a 3rd can of green beans. Came out perfect. It took about 30 minutes for it to be totally warmed up :) Great recipe.

Everyone loved this, although most agreed it is too salty and I didn't add the full tsp of salt. Making again for x-mas but will omit the salt and I'm trying frozen green beans and low-fat processed cheese to see if it mellows it out just a bit. Great alternative to the traditional w/cream of mushroom soup.

Only change I would make is to leave off teaspoon of salt.  I assume with the teaspoon of cajun seasoning it was too much salt for me.  I will make it again because I think with just cream of mushroom soup it always takes too bland.  This had a great flavor.

nice change from the original.  I followed recipe using fresh green beans that I steamed ahead of time.  I  think I will add a little milk next time, as the sauce was a little thick.

Wow!  Did this twist on an old family favorite really go over well this year.  I doubled the recipe and because I wanted it to be vegetarian I used cream of celery soup.  I also chopped the fried onions and stirred them into the mix instead of putting over top to avoid the soggy factor since I was making this ahead and traveling with it.  Only thing I will do differently next time is to omit the additional salt.

I really enjoyed this and made it at thanksgiving.  It is a bit spicy though, and my husband said spicy doesn't belong at thanksgiving!  lol.  I found it a refreshing change from the same old boring green been casserole.

Did this in the crockpot two Thanksgiving's ago, because my Aunt doesn't have a stove :)  Worked very well!  It was a big hit, and so now I am responsible for the green beans!

I absolutely loved this! I love cream of chicken and anything cheese. The first few times I made this it was gone so fast I had to increase the beans. I used the french cut green beans and omit the cajun. I haven't been brave enough to try it with the cajun yet. This is a keeper!

This was very good thanks. I would like to try it again with fresh green beans. I was short one can of the french fried onions and used cream of mushroom soup as I don't eat meat.

Great recipe! Everyone liked it on Thanksgiving. In my opinion,  way better than the cream of mushroom usual. I used fresh green beans,  omitted salt, and used less cajun seasoning for the kids. Turned out great. Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful, easy, and very fast! The only thing I would do for next time is to add a little less salt. I think a whole teaspoon is a lot with the cajun seasoning. Next time I will add only 1/4 teaspoon.

i increased the recipe for 15 servings, but it was way too much chicken soup. I would use only 1 can of soup and 4 cans green beans drained, no salt. The cheese (I had cheddar) was good as well as the Cajun seasoning, black pepper and of course French fried onions.  Everyone liked the Cajun flavor and i will do that again.  Thanks!

I made this tonight tweaking it a bit based off of some of the previous reviews comments and it was a major hit!!!! I added 3 cans of green beans versus two. Put a layer of french fried onions on the bottom and added a can of rotel tomatoes with chilies versus using the cajun seasoning. I did not add any salt, it didn't need it and I also used cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken. It was delicious!

This is actually the best one out there, however, I didn't use the Cajun season and made alternative items, I'd used cream of mushroom soup, added onions and butter. Wonderful!

i stole the basics of this recipe and made it my own.. 
i cant tell you how many people have begged me for the sole ingredients.
do as the directions follow but use slightly less soup then called for. 1 6 ounce can of cream of mushroom and 1 6 ounce can of cream of chicken and mix it with processed cheddar cheese before i microwave. when im finished and before i top off the with the french fried onions i cook 1 package of bacon till crisp layer the top till its practically covered then my onions go on top. Never fails and leaves watering mouths every time!!

Every year at Thanksgiving my dad and I whine about not having any green bean casserole since my mom doesn't like it. Last year I took matters into my own hands and made this delicious recipe. Even my mom, former hater of the green bean casserole, requested I make it again. AND I have to at least triple the recipe because double was almost not enough last year. This is great! I think this year I'll add the onions to the bottom as well.

Wow...this is delicious!!!  Perfect for a somewhat light main dish but still filling.  I'm sure it would also make a great side.  This is my first time making and only my second time eating green bean casserole, so I'm not familiar with the Thanksgin=ving traditions, but I may start my own:).  It would be five strars, but it was way too salty.  Next time I will either use 1/2 teaspoon or leave the extra salt out all together.  Still delicious though.  Definitely give it a try.

Loved this recipe!  We always keep a lot of cheese on hand in our house, but not the processed cheese.  So I just dumped a bunch of shredded cheese into the mix and melted it.  It was wonderful.  How can you go wrong using cheese in ANY recipe!  At least in our household!  Quick and easy also.
