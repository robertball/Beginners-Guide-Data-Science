The first time I made this, I followed the recipe adding the cooked hashbrowns on top. Everyone loved it at a MOPS brunch and I'm asked to make it everytime! The next time I made it, I made it the night before in the crockpot. I doubled the recipe and added a package of O'Brien potatoes into the recipe, not on top, and cooked it overnight, so I wasn't so rushed in the morning. It was just as good and much easier to prepare the night before. It was all gone within minutes!

I loved this casserole as did my husband and his family. There was not a bite left. Instead of topping it with bread I topped it with hashbrowns that I had already cooked in a skillet. I let the casserole bake for about 30 minutes while I was frying the hashbrowns on the stove and then I pulled the casserole out, topped it with the shredded hashbrowns and continued to bake it for about 20 more minutes. Delish! Thanks for a great recipe!

First off, I consider myself a pretty good cook and I'm not a beginner.  So, I followed a tip to put it in the crockpot and double it.  I had it on low all night.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the crockpot though - no browning on top and sausage and cheese layer on the bottom cooked too much.  I also used the hashbrowns just mixed in with the gravy mix - wouldn't recommend that tip either.  I think browning them on the stovetop and then putting them on top is a better idea just cooked in a casserole dish.  However, the taste was bland.  The top half didn't have enough salt and the sausage/cheese layer was WAY too salty.  Might have tasted better if it was all mixed together maybe?  I brought it to a MOPS group and only half was eaten.  Brought it home and my husband only had one helping and I had to toss the rest.  If I ever do try this again, I'll use the casserole dish like it says to and then brown the hashbrowns first before putting them on top.  I have a fantastic egg casserole recipe that we use for xmas every year and it's fantastic - I hope they post it on this site soon.  I wish I'd have made my tried and true recipe for the MOPS group!  Should have tried it on my family first!

Leaving out the bread is a big mistake (use french bread if you have it)!  Yes definitely add hash browns, but place a single layer of  hash brown potato PATTYS on the BOTTOM!  It makes a crust.  Follow the rest of the recipe exactly except add two additional eggs and a half cup of milk when using a 13 x 9 pan.  Of course, fresh gound pepper is a must.  I make many breakfast casseroles and this is my new fav!!  Bake 50 - 60 minutes.

excellent! We try a different casserole each Christmas, and my  husband claims this to now be his current favorite. Made last night and put in fridge, and simply put in oven this morning. After reading the reviews, I didn't use bread, and I browned a bag of hashbrowns with the sausage, along with one finely chopped onion. I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage. Put that in the bottom  of a 9x13 pan, put on a handful of cheese and then the gravy mix. Baked this morning and then added a little more cheese when almost done. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was super easy and everyone I made it for loved it.  Just a few things I wanted to note: the butter on top is not necessary, but I did use the paprika.  Also if you have mushrooms and bell peppers around they add a little something extra.  And I used turkey sausage to cut some calories and fat.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  Extremely easy and it goes together exactly as written.  I doubled it and served it for Christmas morning brunch and it was a huge hit.  I have served MANY breakfast casseroles - and this is the best EVER!  I will be doing it again and again!

I had a few cocktails before making this recipe and got a little fast and loose with the ingredients, but I will say this: what defines this recipe versus, say, crust less quiche or other breakfast casseroles, is the addition of the package of country gravy mix. The submitter of this recipe has offered what I would consider a very forgiving recipe -- I would never leave out the country gravy mix, though.

I forgot the water. Didn't seem to affect it. Like most people here, I improvised with the cheese. I used 1 package of sausage, one packet of bacon, and 12 eggs. Not because I wanted to. I was tipsy. It still turned out great.

Next time I will follow the recipe to a T. What drew me to it was the country gravy mix, and that, folks, is the secret to this recipe's much deserved high rating.

I made this when my in-laws came to visit last weekend.  It got rave reviews and my mother-in-law left with the recipe!  I like this one much better than the previous breakfast casserole I used to make because it's much less greasy. I substituted a bag of defrosted shredded hashbrowns for the bread.  My husband suggested putting the casserole under the broiler for the last few minutes to make the hashbrowns a little crispier.  I'll try that next time.

What an awesome casserole!!  I scaled this to 25 for a retreat at my church.  I should have made more because it was gone in no time and they were wanting more.  I added thawed uncooked hashbrowns before adding the egg mixture.  It tasted delicious!! Will definitely make again!!

Very good and easy.  I have seen this recipe before and I thought I had to make this the night before so I did, and then read the recipe and it didn't ask for me to do that... but I made it the next morning it was just great!  Suggestions:  use french bread and cut into one inch blocks,and  I added more green onions.  But perfect for brunch or Christmas morning, where you just want to stick in the oven and go enjoy the morning!  THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!

First of all, I followed this to the letter and it was just wonderful.  My entire family plus a couple neighbor kids loved it.  Husband says it is a once a week deal and he is picky.
    When an original recipe is changed it cannot be given a fair rating so before rating something with  3 stars try making it again and follow the recipe, by changing it you are the one who made it not great.

Excellent breakfast casserole! I sprinkled a little more cheese on top, 10 minutes before removing it from the oven.

This is now our go-to breakfast casserole.  It is tasty and fairly simple to make.  It can easily be put together the night before, and popped into the oven in the morning.  We like to use sage sausage.  We made it as listed except, at other reviewer's suggestions, we added a layer of seasoned cooked hash browns before adding the eggs, and doubled the recommended amount of cheese.  I put the water, milk, and gravy mix in a jar, and shake it together before adding it to the eggs, to prevent the lumps that we got the first time that we made it. For variety, I also like to add mushrooms and green pepper.  It may sound like we tweaked it a lot, but we have made it several different times, and it is always really good!  Thank you for the great recipe, Kristin!

I tried this recipe for a brunch last week.  I omitted the onions (my daughter doesn't like them)but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great.  I followed another reviewers idea and cubed the bread, grated the cheese and browned the sausages the night before so it was really easy to throw together. This is my favourite site for recipes and I always read and value a lot of the reviewers comments before I actually make the recipe.

This an old recipe as can be seen from review dates. The hash brown topping is far superior to bread cubes but a unique and time saving twist is to use frozen Tater-Tots. This way you don't bother with the extra cooking and cleaning step of frying hash browns.

The Tater-Tots should be placed on top for the length of cooking time recommended on the package.  Use as few or as many as you wish.  Create a grid with a little spacing and it makes portioning out quite simple.

Made this for dinner last night (: Followed the recipe with some minor changes. I added green pepper..since I have so many from my garden. Also, I have issues with packaged foods, so I made my own gravy to use in this casserole. The gravy recipe I followed is from this site: Mom's Country Gravy. This turned out pretty tasty. My husband said he would definitely eat this again! Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful basic recipe that will generally please just about anyone.  My changes:  I did not have green onion, so I substituted 4 oz of green chilis.   I also used italian cheese french bread cut into cubes over the top.  The flavor of this was wonderful.   Made this for breakfast for a large group while staying in our cabin on a family vacation.  I had browned the sausage ahead and refrigerated, and also cubed the bread the day before and stored in a plastic bag, which made it super easy to put together in the morning.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I joined AllRecipes just so I could rate this recipe (have come to this site for years tho).  Was looking for a breakfast casserole I could bulk up & turn into a low-cal dinner and this is IT, IT, IT!  Made these changes:  Halved the basic recipe but used 1 C. Egg Beaters; 1/2 pound turkey sausage; 1/3 C. sausage-flavored country gravy mix (rest is reserved to flavor soup); sauteed 1/2 large ea. of chopped green & red pepper, zucchini, summer squash; 2 green oniions, 1 lg. clove garlic, 2 C. chopped cabbage, all sauteed till completely soft/reduced & mixed with separately-sauteed sausage; sprayed bread cubes with Pam & sprinkled them with dried herbs; baked in a sprayed 11x7" glass pan. Family thought it sounded like it would be horrid.  However, they RAVED! And RAVED!  Didn't taste low-cal one bit. I will make this VERY often for dinner...and watch the pounds melt away, deliciously.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  I've changed it a little.  I don't buy green onions because I don't use them all and they go bad. Instead I use a drained can of green chilies.  Instead of cooking the sausage I use a box of frozen sausage links warmed in the microwave and then chopped in the food processor. Instead of the gravy mix I add 2 tablespoons of flour, salt, pepper and a dash of poultry seasoning.  I don't put the bread on top we prefer biscuits with honey.  I make this once a week so my Husband can warm up his own breakfast before he walks the dog. Thanks Kristin.

I love this reciepe.  This is the first casserole I ever made and it was excellent.  I took the other reviewers advice and added hashbrowns on the top.  Cooking those before adding to the top half way through.  I also substituted and put bacon instead of sausage.  That was a great we are bacon people!  Also I made it and used it each workday for breakfast, great quick option!

Instead of using bread, I used hashbrowns for the carb since it's healthier- and they were awesome!:)

This is a great, quick recipe to make especially at the last minuete. I try to keep pre-cooked sausage on hand, double the bread or use cubed buns and extra butter on the top. I've found that it takes longer to bake than the directions state but all in all this is a great recipe.

Thank you Kristin for a great morning casserole!!  The only change I made was I used shredded hash browns for the topping as others suggested.  My husband and I thought it was excellent.  Leftovers were easily warmed in the microwave for 2 more days!!  I think next time I might add some chopped broccoli.  Thanks again!! UPDATE: I made this using the bread cubes drizzled with some melted butter and it was delicious this way, too.

I made this recipe for a quick Christmas morning breakfast since it is always hectic around our house with preparations for our family dinner.  What I liked about the recipe is that I wa able to do most of the prep work the night before.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and topped it with hashbrowns instead of the bread cubes.  Next time I'd like to add the mushrooms and bell peppers that another reveiwer suggested.  I have one suggestion which is to season the hashbrowns.  I felt the casserole tasted a little flat.  My husband suggested I add a dash of hot sauce to the egg mixture next time to give it a little punch.  Thanks Kristin

Oh, how yummy this was! Took another reviewers tip and topped it with hashbrowns instead of the bread, other than that I followed the recipe to a T! Used hot sausage since we like it spicy! A huge hit on Christmas morning and even the leftovers were excellent the next day! thank you...my search is over for the perfect breakfast casserole.

I made this recipe but substituted a bag of seasoned croutons scattered across the top instead of the bread.  Baked for 30 minutes @ 350 (because I was also cooking cinnamon rolls in the oven at the same time), and it turned out perfect.  Will make again.

Instead of using the gravy mix. I added 1 package of ranch seasoning mix. It was OUTSTANDING!!!!!!! Probably the best casserole I've ever made (possibly had).

This was pretty good.  Hubby liked it better than I did.  I cooked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  It is the kind of recipe that lends itself to variations.  Putting hash browned potatoes on top is a nice touce.   I can envision it as a handy dish to fix for a group or a holiday brunch; preparing it the night before and popping in the oven in the morning.  Serving it with sliced tomatoes and avocados is a festive touch.

This was good, the dish relies heavily on your choice of sausage!! We couldn't taste the gravy mix almost at all, though. Next time I may just put it on top when we eat it, that way we get the gravy texture, too. Used the bread on top and was pleasantly surprised that it came out crispy and not soggy at all. I used a 9 x 13 pan and 10 eggs, but the same amount of milk/water. A very good base recipe to change to your liking. I'm going to put biscuits on top next time and use the gravy separately, at some point in time I may add some veggies as well, and will DEF try the hashbrown thing when I have some!

Prett good. I listened to suggestions and I topped the casserole with pan-browned hash browns. This dish turned out great. Try using reduced fat sausage.

I have been making this dish, or variations of it, for nine years! I've made it as written and with my own flourishes or quick fixes when I didn't have a specific ingredient. This recipe is versatile. Some changes I have made before: grated potato and onion topping; Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage; no gravy;  different cheeses.

Great base! This is an excellent base with all kinds of possibilities! Now, do make sure your sausage is well-drained. You could add cooked mushrooms, more onion as I did and peppers, maybe even a Florentine with broccoli (well drained and chopped) and other cheeses.  I also added some Cavendar's Greek Seasoning.  Great stuff if you haven't tried it yet! Stale bread works best. This could even be excellent with cooked spinach, kale and swiss cheese! Enjoy!!

This recipe is awesome!! The first time I tried it I tried it exactly as written. It was excellent and there were no left overs. The second time I tried it I didn't have enough bread so I used hash browns and was out of sausage so used bacon.It was again excellent. I love this recipe because it can be used with anything on hand and tastes good. Thank you for sharing!

It's really hard to stop eating this casserole. My roommate and I made it following the recipe, using a mix of sourdough and wheat bread. Personally, I love the taste of sourdough so if I make it again I'd use all sourdough. Also, instead of drizzling the butter over the breadcrumbs, I think frying them up with a little bit of salt and pepper (and garlic!) would make the breadcrumbs fantastic. It was super easy to make. :) 

We also agreed that hashbrowns on this would have been amazing so long as the top stayed crispy. We were thinking either a bottom layer or mixing in with the bread.

Okay, I had ever intention on following the recipe, but I didn't have a few things, as we are moving and I'm trying to us up everything we have, instead of buying the exact things. So I used egg whites, coby/jack shredded mix, about 3/4 cup of sour cream, 3-4 tbs of dried chopped chives, copy of good sprinkles of the herb Mrs. Dash, and half of a pound of breakfast sausage, instead of the bread, I used the country cubed frozen breakfast potatoes. I cooked the sausage, and mixed everything together and backing for about 35 minutes at 350... Smells wonderfully and is setting great!!! Can't wait...

I've never had a breakfast casserole before! Boy have I been missing out. This was everything we wanted for breakfast in one dish. It is also very filling. A little piece goes a long way. I will be making this at least 2-3 times a month; we don't eat breakfast too often. This was also easy to put together.

This was a great recipie, but I used bacon and heavy whipping cream instead of milk (it was Christmas) with the hashbrowns.  The first time I used a half a bag of hashbrowns and I thought it wouldn't be enough but it came out great and my mother in law (who hates everything) actually took it home.  Making it again today, but adding the whole bag of hashbrowns.

OMG!!! Delicious!!!!  I can't believe I didn't rate this before!!  I made it last year for hubby for Father's Day.  It was not only easy, delicious BUT filling too!!!!  The only thing I did different was I didn't have any bread on hand (forgot to buy it).  So I layered the hash browns on the bottom & then followed the recipe thru.  THE BEST COUNTRY BREAKFAST WE'VE EVER HAD!!!!! THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH FOR SHARING!!!!  It's a staple in our house for guests or just for us!!!!

Thanks to those who provide variations to the original recipe!  I too added hash browns to this casserole (cooked them with the sausage and onion).  I fed many grown men and all enjoyed this dish.

Delicious. Family really enjoyed this. I cubed English muffins spread with butter. We all agreed the bread texture was a little better (less crunchy, less abrasive to the roof of your mouth) after the dish sat for about 15 minutes.

Yes, kjr, it is a dry mix.  It can usually be found in an area with other dry gravy mixes, dry sauce mixes, dry marinade mixes etc.  Usually all you need is water.  My personal  favorite is Pioneer brand.  You can use it on most anything: biscuits, chicken, potatoes.   I did try this.  It was excellent... but the calories... wow!  And the cholesterol... This is a lumberjack's breakfast. But he'd leave the table with a smile on his face.  Thank you, Kristin Trostle.

Made this for my husband who LOVES breakfast. I made it with no green peppers or onions but with olives and mushrooms.  I used hash browns instead of cubed bread crumbs.  Awesome!  The flavor is spot on! Will make again and again!

Delicious just as it is. I made this for my husband and he ate it up! He said he loved it and wants me to make it again. I have made another breakfast casserole recipe from this site and he said that this one was the better of the two. Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this recipe!!  I don't even like sausage but everyone else does so I gave it a try.  It was delicious!  I had to make a couple of changes--used regular onions because I didn't have green on hand.  Also cooked some frozen sausage patties and cut them up because I didn't have the other type on hand either.  Oh my gosh..my kids, husband, inlaws and I gobbled the whole casserole in one sitting.    I served with the Honey Fruit Salad recipe from this site which also took very little time.  Spectacular!  We'll definitely make this again.

We really liked this casserole. I took the suggestion of using hash browns instead of the bread,we used turkey breakfast sausage,and baked in a 9x13 casserole without doubling the recipe. Also to brown the hash browns I turned the oven up to 400 degrees for about the last 5-6 minutes; doing this will give hash browns a golden brown, but you have to watch and adjust to not scorch the eggs and cheese inside.

I've made this three times now- every time it has been awesome!  I would definitely recommend using Cheddar cheese and not substituting with a blend- it adds that extra flavor.  I've also added bacon and bell peppers to change it up. Hash browns are also a good addition with the bread cubes. Fantastic!  Will make over and over again!

This is a great recipe!I followed the recipe exactly,except I added a couple of ingredients. I added a small can of green chilis and an 8-oz. package of cream cheese(cut into 1/2 inch cubes)which I pressed into the casserole evenly, before baking. The cream cheese was an awesome extra!!! Next time, I think I will try this with hashbrowns pressed into the bottom of the casserole dish like a crust.

I can only review this according to what the people who ate it told me.  I personally don't like sausage but this smelled incredible as I was making it.  I increased the egg by one and added a little extra milk because I used a 9x13 pan.  I also added an extra green onion.  It was a huge hit and several people asked for the recipe.

WONDERFUL!!! I did as another person did by not leaving out the bread on top and adding hasbrown patties to the bottom and 1/2 cup more milk and two more eggs for a 9×13 dish as the other review suggested and it was sooo good! Will make again for sure!

Our daughter made this for our Christmas brunch. She opted not to use hashbrowns, but added a butter cracker crumble on top -- for a bit of crunch. It was a hit with adults & children alike....mmmm!!!

I made the casserole and by looking at the ingredients, I had a feeling it was going to be bland.  I used maple flavored breakfast sausage, Arnold's butter top split bread, and seasoned the egg/country gravy mix/milk/water mix with some black pepper and Morton's Nature's seasoning blend.  I also put the dish on the top rack so it could brown the top because I was afraid that it would be soggy. The bread was nice and toasted and the dish is good!  I will be making this again.

Great recipe for a lazy Saturday! I didn't have gravy mix (I don't use mixes for things I can make easily), so I just made a pot of milk gravy and substituted that for the gravy pouch and liquid ingredients, allowing it to cool before adding the eggs. Delicious! It will absolutely be making its way into our weekend breakfast rotation.

This breakfast casserole was all right, nothing spectacular though. I had to bake it probably about 15 minutes longer than the stated time to make sure that it was cooked through all the way. I liked the flavor of it, but thought there was too much bread topping if you use all six slices of bread. If I make this again, I will cut down on that. I would probably even add another egg or two to the mixture because I thought that layer was a little thin. But on the plus side, this is the first breakfast casserole that my three year old has willingly eaten! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Not my favorite breakfast casserole, make exactly as written, though it seemed something was missing.  Probably won't make again but if I do I might follow other posters who used hashbrowns on top instead of bread.

I followed this recipe to the T and found nothing exceptional about it.  The bread on top turned out crispy on the top and soggy on the bottom. As others said, hashbrowns would have been far better.  the gravy got lost somewhere in there. no one really liked this until I took the bread off the top and put the rest of the mix on tortillas like a breakfast taco.  Definitely a waste of ingredients in my opinion.

Very good! As others have done, I used the hashbrowns instead of bread.  I browned them prior to putting in the casserole.  I also used only half the cheese on the sausage mixture and then topped the dish with the other half.  Also sprinkled green onions on top for color.  YUMMY!

Loved it!  We had this Christmas morning and our whole family raved about it.  My son wants me to make it again.  I didn't change a thing and we actually liked the bread on top.  Gave it a good crunch.  Really great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Make this dish just as it is written. Delish!  I have to bake it longer - one hour to an hour and fifteen minutes, but  I prepare everything the night before and then assemble so perhaps it is because the sausage is not warm.  Regardless, it's easy and yummy.

I make breakfast for my office (40 people) a few times a year.  Everyone loves this recipe and it's easy for me as I can prepare the night before and simply throw in the oven at work.  I don't use the bread, however and instead add a bag of frozen hashbrowns.

Great recipe. I added the shredded hashbrowns on top and layered the bottom with the bread slices - it turned out delicious. There are so many variations you can do with this. The timing and ingredient proportions are just right!

I noticed that people added hashbrowns.  But I put canned biscuits on top of my casserole (going with the biscuits and gravy theme).  People raved about this.  The second time I also added 1 tsp of hot sauce to the eggs.  I have made this several times and it is always gone. 
Thanks for the recipe.

My family thought the bread should be on the bottom to absorb some of the flavors.  On top it was just dry and added nothing to the casserole.  Otherwise, it was easy and tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe! I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit with almost all in attendance asking for the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly only using tater tots on top at the end instead of the bread. I omitted the melted butter since it was not needed for the tater tots!! Thanx for such a great recipe!!

My kids are my best critics, even my 10 year old who doesn't like eggs.  Her plate was empty,(I did use eggbeaters).  Made this one for overnight guests and had limited time in the morning so I was a little leary of make it the morning of.  I cooked the sausage the night before and had everything else ready.  Cooked in a 9x13 so it would cook in time.  It was a hit and the kids all said it deserves 5 stars.

So good!! I skipped the bread, and used frozen potatoes-o'brien instead. Also, I used vegetarian sausage cut in to small pieces and even the non-vegetarians at work loved it!! Going to make it again on Christmas!

Loved this recipe! I used hashbrowns instead of bread crumbs and it turned out great. Next time I will use spicy sausage for a little more kick.

I made the casserole for my church group and they loved it! It was my first casserole, so the prep time was a little bit longer than I expected. I will definitely try it again, probably adding bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms.

I'm always looking for new recipes for weekend company.  I think I've found another winner!  I made this for my family and they loved it.  The only thing I changed was to use tator tot crowns on the top.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Found this in my recipe box one night when I was desperate for something quick and easy and I didn't have anything thawed. While I did make some changes out of necessity (used what I had on hand) it turned out perfect, and has become a favorite in my house for a quick and easy supper. The only changes I made were: Since I was out of bulk sausage, I sliced thin some smoked link sausage and put it in the oven to brown, and I used old fashioned red rind hoop cheese. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. I served it with baked spicy potato wedges and a tossed salad (fruit salad would have been better). Even my picky granddaughter asked for seconds. Best and easiest breakfast casserole I've ever tried.

This was really easy and completely devoured.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it for the same time and temp in a fairly deep 9x13 pan, though my oven runs a little hot.  Very good and will make again.

This is my secret weapon for picky eaters--I have never had a complaint from this casserole. I've made it a number of times, and unlike other recipes for breakfast casseroles, I didn't have to adjust a thing about it!! Thanks so much for what I consider to be one of the best recipes on this site!!

Made this casserole this w/end.  Loved it.  While cooking the sausage I added in mushrooms.  I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage, gave it a zing!  I forgot the bread cubes and it was still great.  With out bread it makes a good Low Carb diet if you're into that.

When looking at the ingredients it seemed as though it would be flavorful. The only change I made was used O'Brian potatoes instead of the bread to top the dish. I even added seasoning to the potatoes before I baked it. It was quite bland, the gravy did nothing for the overall dish and seemed kind of pointless. I made it this morning for a sleepover and no one liked it.

Excellente!  Even kids ate it up!  I needed to use some things up so I dressed it up a bit.  First I used 2 packages of turkey sausage and added some seasonings and put it in a 9 by 13.  Then I put 6 green onions on top.  I then sauteed red & yellow bell pepper and mushrooms.  I didn't have 6 eggs-used 4.  I made my own gravy from scratch and I used mozzarella and parmesan.  I broke up hashbrown patties on top and wah lah.  It was wonderful!  I Served it with an easy fruit salad and homeade orange julius.

I took this to my Sunday School breakfast.  It must have been wonderful, it was gone in less than 20 minutes!  My husband and I didn't even get to try it.  Everyone raved.  The only changes I made were to add some "Real Bacon" bacon bits on top of the cooked sausage, I forgot to add the butter, and I used cajun seasoning instead of the paprika.  It was a hit.  My son made me promise to make one for him since he didn't get any of this one (He's 8)!  I'll make it again for sure.

This recipe was easy and great! We adjusted to 6 servings and used an 8 x 8 pan. We modified the recipe a bit and used spicy sausage, a little extra green onion, and we topped the mixture with a little extra diced yellow onion and a diced tomato. Then, we toasted the bread before cutting it into squares to place on top. We will definitely make this again!

This is super but I needed to bake it at 350 and I changed the toast squares the second time I made it to just laying the bread lightly buttered across the top - We loved it.

I fixed it strictly by the recipe and the family loved it. Myself i felt that the gravy was lost in the mix. Next time I'm going to try it with the gravy as a topping after cooking it.

Very good, I used bacon instead of sausage and brushed butter on with a BBQ brush...everyone really liked it! Also I did half with onions and half without, both taste fine but I liked it with onions better.

Family raved! I usually have to "edit" most recipes just to make them my own. Followed the recipe exactly and the result was perfection! A definite "make again" dish.

I made this as instructed in the original recipe with no modifications. My family found this to be absolutely delicious! We had a couple of casseroles for Thanksgiving morning so we could work on prepping dinner and it was the first one gone. I will definitely make this one again and again!

Amazing recipe! My husband and I doubled the eggs, halved the gravy and layered cooked potatoes o'brian on top of the sausage layer (omitting the toast). We also added a handful of sliced pickled jalpeños to the top before baking.

This was great, woke up this morning wanting to make a quiche but found out my pie shell wasn't any good so I started looking for something else w/o a shell.  Found this and was amazed!  Love it!  I did half the recipe since there is just 2 of us but did use an entire green onion(what am I going to do with half a green onion?). I'm glad I did, love that taste of the onion.  I did have a change in the cheese, no cheddar so I used my mexican mix.  I really don't think the type of cheese matters, so use what you like. Yummy, think I'll make this next time I need to bring a Breakfast Casserole somewhere.  So easy.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful.  It was so easy to prepare and the gravy mix definitely makes a difference.  I did brush the bread on top with butter and it was fantastic.  Other readers made all different kinds of alterations that I'm sure would also be wonderful.  I like how one cook put it:  It's a forgiving recipe.  You can definitely customize it to your liking and ingredients on hand.  I saw lots of people added hash browns and while I love has browns, the recipe doesn't need it!  I will be making this recipe again for sure!

I chose this recipe for a fundraiser at work because it didn't have the ubiquitous hash browns; I wanted something a little different, and was intrigued by the use of green onion and country gravy mix. I followed the recipe exactly, using sage sausage and homemade country gravy mix. I cut the slices of bread in half widthwise, buttered them, and arranged them on top, so it would be easy to tell what a serving size was. I also reserved a little of the shredded cheese and sprinkled it on top of the bread. It looked beautiful when it came out of the oven, and it is delicious! Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!

Doubled the recipe. Made 9x13 pan and 9x9 pan. It was really good. I cooked the green onions with  ground sausage and used country potatoes (the square ones) instead of bread.
Found myself wanting some bread though. It was really good the next day.

I will use this again. I followed the directions complete, I might add regular onion rather than the green onion next time. Other than that, this was a good, quick casserole for guests.

I had family visiting this weekend for a huge graduation party and I have a wonderful recipe for an egg/bread/sausage breakfast casserole but you have to make it the night before.  Well I was so tired after the festivities that I completely forgot to do it.  I woke Sunday morning to realize my mistake and started frantically looking for something I could cook with similar ingredients.  I ran across this one and decided to substitute the bread cubes for shredded hash browns and my guests LOVED it!!!  My brother-in-law said he thought it was the best breakfast casserole he’d ever had!  My husband said he liked it more than the other casserole that I was going to make, sorry Grandma! AND we all preferred it without salsa, hot sauce, etc. on it!  (Which is unusual for us.) Thank you so much for this recipe!  You saved the day!!

I have made this MANY times and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe. We have it every Christmas morning, as well. It is gobbled up fast! I add a hefty sprinkling of black pepper and substitute shredded hashbrowns instead of bread on top (cook the hasbrowns about halfway in a skillet before spreading on top of casserole and popping in the oven). Paprika is a MUST! It really adds to the flavor.

My husband and I had this for dinner last night and it was great! He Loved this recipe! It was very simple to make and turned out fantastic! I used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage, and threw in the green onion and a bell pepper just as the sausage was almost done cooking. After adding the sausage/pepper & onion layer, I only used 1 1/2 cups of cheese, added the egg/milk/gravy mixture, then topped with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese. I did not add butter to the bread layer, but did sprinkle with paprika. I put the oven on broil for the last 5 minutes of cooking to get the bread nice and crispy. Will be making this recipe again and again! Thanks

Made this for company and everyone loved it!  Replaced the bread with hash browns as others had suggested and put it under the broiler for a few minutes after it was done baking just to get the hash browns a little crispy.  Great easy breakfast for a group of people.

'Excellent breakfast dish!  I made this for our Sunday morning fellowship at church and everyone loved it.  Even had someone who ask for the recipe.  I'm sure that hash browns taste great on top of the casserole but I stayed with the original recipe and used bread cubes and melted butter.  Very tasty dish!  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loved it!  I used spicy breakfast sausage.  I also did the optional butter and paprika on top the bread cubes, then sprinkled a little precooked bacon and a little bit of extra cheese on top.  Baked in a 13x9 baking pan for the 40 minutes and it came out perfect.  Heart attack in a pan, but awesome!

This is delicious for an occasional breakfast treat. I couldn't find country gravy mix, so I made it with the sausage drippings and omitted the milk and water from the recipe. I also omitted the green onions (I don't like onions with eggs), topped with hash browns instead of bread, omitted the butter, and used about half the cheese. I broiled for an additional 5 min. to brown the hash browns. I way oversalted this--I think the sausage and cheese probably add enough salt on their own, so don't make my mistake and add any more until after you've tasted it.

I've made before and it's fabulous.  I'd like to make it with biscuits instead like Shamanjon's note, so do you or anyone know if I should bake the biscuits first?  Or can I just put the raw dough on top and let them cook off in the oven while cooking casserole?  Thanks!

Love Love Love this casserole! I do add hashbrowns on the bottom and have the bread on top. It is a complete meal in one pan and less mess to clean up. But the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was great too.

Used Sharp Cheddar Cheese, good whole wheat bread, extra green onion and even pan fried and crumbled up some bacon to mix in with the sausage. Bread got nice and toasted on top. It could use maybe 5 or 10 minutes extra in the oven. Everyone loved it!

It was edible.  I agree with previous reviewers that the bread was unnecessary, except that maybe 1 slice scattered on top might give it that crouton-like crunch that overpowered it as written. Salt was needed to the egg mixture.  The baking time was WAY off, needed at least 1 hour. Also I agree that the gravy mix got lost in the recipe, all that good taste seemed to disappear for unknown reasons.

This was absolutely wonderful!  My family had to make themselves stop eating.  As always, I used what I had available.  I used 12 oz of Maple Syrup Sausage Links, 4 chopped green onion, about 1/4C extra cheese and 7 eggs.  I didn't have a 11x8 inch, so I used a 13x9 and added the extra ingrediants mentioned.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE; it's going in my favorites.

I made this for dinner one night and my husband loved it. He is not one to like "breakfast food" for dinner but he asked that I make this a regular dinner! I also added shredded hashbrowns and bacon to the casserole. Dont hesitate to make it according to your own tastes--I dont think you can go wrong!

This was a big hit. I made it the day before but left off the bread. Pulled it out of the fridge for about an hour and then put the bread on with no butter. 40 minutes was the perfect time. Thanks!

I had gotten "drafted" to help prepare a men's breakfast with my husband at our church.  This was definitely the favorite.  Very easy.  Next time may substitute a seasoned bread for more flavor. Yummy!!

I didn't care for the texture of this casserole. You couldn't even taste the gravy flavor and I used a good one not a cheap watery one.

I tried this for supper because we all love breakfast anytime of day in my house. I was tempted to do what others said and use potatoes on top but thought I would follow the recipe exact. I don't know what I did wrong because it was the first one I couldn't eat. My family liked it and went back for seconds but somehow it was too greasy for me. My husband ate his and mine too. I might make again for them and leave off the butter or use taters. 4 stars because out of husband and 4 kids none complained.

Yummy was the word I heard after serving this to my family.  Made as written but didn't add the onion and used leftover french bread that I cut into cubes instead of sliced white bread.

Wow, this was really yummy. My husband and I don't normally like breakfast casseroles, and this one was quite tasty. We loved adding a little hot green pepper sauce with it. We made it the night before and just stuck it in the oven in the morning. It was so easy!

I'm not a huge egg fan, so I made this recipe for my husband. He loved it!  I used egg substitute, half of the sausage, and hash browns.  I have never made a breakfast casserole before, but this is one that I will make again.

I have been making this recipe for a really long time.  I double the egg, milk,water, and gravy packets.  I have a family of 6 and that will allow for one pan.  It is a great breakfast dish or quick dinner.

I used this recipe as a guide.  Started with 1/2 lb. mild Italian sausage.  To that I added 1/4 each of a yellow and red onion and 5 large white mushrooms sliced.  Sauteed all until onions were translucent.  When completed cooking, I added about 1 tbsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp Chipotle powder and tossed.

I spread the mixture in the bottom of an 8"x8"x2" and covered with about 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese because I had some I needed to use up.

I followed the rest of the recipe per instructions except I used 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup water.

This came out great and I will make again.  One idea that comes to mind is using smoked cheddar.  Can't wait to try it!

Thanks!

My family did very much enjoy the recipe.
I did however make some changes. I micro-waved 4 small potatoes cut them into small pieces and added them to the sausage. I cooked the casserole for about 20 minutes then topped with biscuits. My grandchildren are my toughest critics and they loved it. We also split the biscuit after it was done and added butter and honey. mmmmmmm

I read the comment below and followed the double recipe for making the dish in the crock pot overnight.  I cooked hashbrowns first in a skillet, then put them on top of the rest of the ingrediants before putting the crock pot lid on for the night.   I made it for my office and they loved it!  Certainly not a low-cal healthy recipe, but savory with a kick!  I'll make this again, no doubt.

I served this on Christmas morning, and we all enjoyed it.  I honestly couldn't taste the gravy mix at all.  I did offer hot sauce and diced green chili on the side for those who wanted added flavor.  This is not my favorite breakfast casserole, but it was a nice one that I will serve again.

Verry Yummy!!  Instead of the bread slices I used almost a whole bag of homestyle potatoes sprinkled with seasoned salt & onion powder(small cubes - that I already cooked).  I also used 2 pkgs of gravy mix and adjusted the water accordingly.  My husband said this was the BEST b'fast casserole I have ever made! Thanks so much for this awesome casserole.  I will be making this again soon...

My husband and son really liked this casserole.  I liked it but thought I have had better breakfast casseroles. I made a couple of changes based on others' suggestions.  I added about 1/4 c finely chopped onion and 1 T fresh minced garlic.  I also increased the green onions to 3.  I use 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup milk and hashbrowns on the top rather than bread.  I baked it as the recipe stated BUT it took nearly twice as long to bake.  I think it might have cooked faster if I used a bigger pan making the casserole not as thick.  I browned the top under the broiler before serving which added a little crunch to it.  I think next time I would cook the potatoes in a fry pan first as someone suggested and then add them to the top about 1/2 way through the cooking.

I actually woke up at 5 in the morning to cook something for my husband. I prepared everything from the night before so it was way easier. I loved this recipe it was so good !!! And my husband loved it ! There was however way too much butter in the pan and it was really greasy. Using less melted butter will really make this the best !!!

Excellent casserole!  Baked it for Christmas breakfast.  I used spicy sausage as someone else suggested and also used shredded hash browns and broiled for 5 minutes at the end to brown the top, looked beautiful!

As written, this is extremely bland - it needs salt and pepper at the very least. This is quick and easy, and it turned out ok, but it definitely needs additional seasonings.

I was a little worried about using the gravy packet, because I'm not a gravy fan, but it really gave this casserole a kick!  Upon suggestion of others, I used shredded hash browns on top, which turned out great.

Absolutely loved this recipe and so did hubby.  Like others, I tweeked the recipe a tiny bit.  I made it with 4 eggs instead because my hubby and I were the only eaters.  I also baked in an 8x8 pan.  I put the cooked hash browns on top after the casserole cooked for 30 min.  Then sprinkled cheese on top of hashbrowns...yummy.  I only had Amish German Sausage..just a little different taste, but very good.  I baked in my toaster oven on broil for the last 6-7 minutes so hashbrowns stayed crispy.  and cheese melted.  With the smaller dish it really only needed about 30 min cooking time.  Hubby was already telling me different items to add next time to "kick it up a notch".  Definitely a keeper!

I halved this b/c it's just my boyfriend and I.  It was perfect for just  two people with a piece leftover for the next day.

I did not like that there were transfat in the packaged country gravy, but found pre-made sausage country gravy and used 8oz of that instead of the package, water and milk.  I added bacon and ham as well.  I also did top it with southern style hashbrowns topped with cheese.

In all it was really good... even the leftover! :)

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Yum!  This is so good!  I added salt and pepper to the eggs, and used 8 eggs since I was making it in a 9X13, but everything else I did as directed.  The top of the bread gets nice and toasted and the gravy mix gives it a wonderful flavor.  A keeper!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  All the flavors go together so nicely!  Used 1 more green onion, spicy sausage, left out paprika. I did use an 8 pack of Grands biscuits and put them on top to cook, but had to turn them after 20 minutes so the bottoms could get cooked.  Next time I will pre-bake the biscuits, or just use leftover biscuits. Had to bake longer than 40 minutes..more like 50.

Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum. I made this today and it was so tasty! I used Maple Flavored sausage and added some potatoes instead of bread and it was perfect. 

I can't wait to eat more tomorrow morning! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This dish was wonderful!  I served it to family with homemade cinnamon rolls, and everyone raved!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (well, I guess I added one more green onion), and the results were perfect!

This was a very good breakfast casserole.  My guests really enjoyed it.  You really couldn't taste the gravy mix that you added, so I was a little disappointed about that.

This was great!  I had to make a few changes because I didn't have the right size pan.  I used a 13 x 9 and increased the eggs to 8.  Also my gravy packet was just a little larger than called for.  Other than using more green onions, those were the only changes I made and this casserole was fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe Kristin.

After reading other reviews I made a couple of changes but the result was great.  I used packaged shredded potatoes on the bottom after liberally spraying with cooking spray.  The potatoes were seasoned liberally with salt, pepper and paprika. (Note: next time I will put potatoes in oven to cook while making sausage in order to crisp it a bit).  I used 8 eggs but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  To crisp the bread and make it more toast like, I sprayed the bread with cooking spray before cooking.  The bread was very "toasty".  Excellent results.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is basically a really good recipe. I did make some minor changes though that I think worked well. As many people suggested, I added some hash brown potatoes on the bottom and then the sausage and cheese and so on. I used 8 eggs and added the green part of 2 green onions to the egg mixture. I also took the white part of 2 green onions and and some sliced fresh mushrooms and sauteed them in the same pan where I cooked the sausage. This sort of deglazed the pan a bit as the mushrooms released their water, capturing some of that wonderful fond on the bottom of the pan. I added those on top of the eggs.  Also, instead of using cubed bread, I used frozen biscuits. To me that makes more sense than bread cubes to go with the country gravy mix and it worked great! I will say that it took closer to an hour to bake, so make sure you leave enough time!

I'm fairly new in the kitchen and read reviews before making. I used Jimmy Dean Maple sausage, used half and half instead of milk, and added hash browns! I layered in the meat and onions, layer of cheese, layer of browned hash brown potatoes, and topped with cheese, added liquid mixture before topping with bread. Definitely drizzle bread prices with butter and the paprika adds just the right season. Had no idea it would be such an instant hit!! Made it for family day AFTER Christmas and it was gone before I could ask how it was.

A new family favorite. The only thing I recommend is shredding your own cheese. It makes any recipe so much better.  Cheese that is already shredded contains anti caking agents so shredding your own makes it so much smoother and creamier.

I loved this recipe!  I am not the biggest fan on breakfast casseroles...or breakfast food in general.   I came across this recipe while browsing the site and thought the list of ingredients sounded interesting, especially the addition of gravy mix.  This was the most wonderfully flavorful breakfast I have ever made!   I used a pound of bulk sausage instead of using links shown in the video.  It was GREAT!

No substitutions,  no adjustments.  This recipe is amazing !! No hashbrowns, no crock pot !! Make it just the way it says.  If you want hashbrowns,  make them on the side.

Make sure to read the baking instructions...I didn't cover and got the temps wrong, but in the end it was still OK...but a bit dry from not covering. I put a single layer of hash browns on the bottom, and we liked the "crust" that it made. Seemed like it needed more eggs, but that could be from not covering it while baking.

This was easy and fast and was good as far as taste goes, but I didn't care for the texture of the eggs mixed with the gravy then added to everything. It cooked good but the egg mix was almost so moist and soft I wasn't sure I was eating eggs in it.

My husband and I both thought this turned out just OK. We both agreed that we would have rather made the gravy separately and poured it on top of the finished casserole. I omitted the sausage because I did not have any and used frozen shredded potatoes mixed with green onion, salt, and pepper as the base. I served it with some turkey bacon on the side. I cut the bread into bigger strips instead of cubes, next time I will concentrate the bread around the edges of the casserole where it browned/toasted up nicely. The bread in the middle of the casserole was a little soggy. Overall it was very easy to make and you can use what you have on hand.

I liked this easy recipe.  Substituted package sausage for 7 link sausage  cooked and chopped and 1/2 cup of cooked bacon, hollandaise sauce to replace the gravy mix and used 1 tube of croissant rolls.
It was really great

Best breakfast casserole dish EVER!  I added some sliced black olives and canned Rotel brand Mexican flavor tomato/peppers to the egg mix.  YummO! What a great way to use up the bread crusts that no one wants for sandwiches!  I left out the butter and sprayed the bread topping with cooking spray.  The dish browned nicely.

The microwaved leftovers made awesome breakfast burritos the next morning. The taste was awesome since I used fried hash browns on top, peppered sausage gravy and an extra green onion.

This was really good.   I followed another's advice and did add french bread cubes to the top (with the drizzle of butter) and fried a skillet of hashbrowns and put them on top of the bread cubes when the casserole was nearly done.   The cubed bread toasts up nicely and the hashbrowns seemed to complete the whole dish.  Made for a wonderful Christmas morning breakfast. Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really liked this, but everyone that I made this for wanted hashbrowns in it so I added a layer of hashbrowns to the bottom and topped with everything else. It was a hit!

My family loves this! The only things I did different was that I used a peppered gravy mix instead of country gravy and I did not put hash browns or bread on top. Instead, I baked some Grands buttermilk biscuits and served the casserole on top of an open biscuit. Then topped the casserole with more peppered gravy that I made. I know it's not the healthiest dish, but I don't make it very often. You can splurge every once in awhile! And I make it for dinner!

I was looking for a new Christmas morning casserole and came across this one.  Read all reviews and made some changes that were suggested and I even prepared it the night before.  To my surprise it was a BIG hit.  To the negative reviews..you must have done something wrong.  I followed it and added chilies instead of the green onion for a little kick and OBrien potatoes on top, a little extra cheese on top while it set for 10 minutes.  Did however have to cook it for an hour.  Can't wait to try again with sage flavored sausage. Thank you all recipes you haven't failed me yet. Judy from PA.

I exchanged the gravy mix for about a cup of home made country gravy, which already had the milk in it, no need to add more; I didn't add any water; I substituted hash browns for strips of bread; and I added a layer of mushrooms sauteed in butter. I also coated the hash browns with a bit of oil and melted butter with salt and pepper. Cooked for 40 mins at 325 then broiled on low for 8 mins to brown. Great base recipe, very easy to customize!

This dish was very good! My mom is traditional and she enjoyed it! I would add more meat. Next time I'll try bacon and ham. It needed a little more flavor.

We really liked this, but did have some changes to make.  I read all the reviews and decided I wanted a crust so did as others did and put hash browns on the bottom.  I don't have frozen ones, so I julienned about 3 potatoes then fried in a skillet with margarine and onion and garlic seasoning until browned.  Frozen probably wouldve been fine to cook in the pan, but in my experience, raw potatoes take forever to bake so it's best to at least parbake prior to use in casseroles.  We both really liked this, but I am very glad I added the potatoes.  I also think that doubling the eggs would be best, as I wanted more eggs in this.  I didn't have bread out that I wanted to use, so I improvised and grabbed old homemade croutons, processed them a bit in the food processor, and basically topped with crouton crumbs.  It turned out really well, and I think it would be good with bread, too. I will try it next time, as I really like the idea of bread on top of a breakfast casserole instead of on the bottom where it often bcomes soggy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have used this recipe twice. Both times, I used the suggestion to substitute the bread with hash browns.  The first time I made this, it was amazing!  Definitely the best breakfast casserole I have ever had.  The second time, my wife insisted on using a reduced fat breakfast sausage.  Everything else was executed the same, with the same ingredients.  It resulted in a good casserole, but I told her we would always have to get "regular" breakfast sausage from now on.  I highly recommend this recipe, and suggest not using a reduced fat sausage.

I have tried several breakfast casseroles, and THIS ONE is the one that my family keeps asking for! The only modifications that I have made to it is that I use between 3 and 4#'s of sausage when I double the recipe (we are a large family with teenagers). I also opted to add the hashbrowns to the top the first time I made this...and then tried potatoes obrien instead. The potatoes obrien went over far better! Overall, this is a VERY delicious recipe that has become a staple in my recipe box!

This was just okay, granted I changed the recipe quite a bit. I used 8 eggs instead of 6. I omitted the green onion and instead added diced red onion and green pepper. I also used shredded hash browns instead of bread and topped with more cheese. I left out the butter. I found this to be sort of bland. My husband and I ate it, but no one went back for seconds. It was okay, but not sure if it was worth the effort.

This was also a big hit at our house. The first bite or two, we weren't quite sold yet, but suddenly it grows on you! We also found it gets tastier when it sits a bit or is reheated. I added some paprika on top of ours. This will be a staple in our breakfast rotation!

We LOVE thos breakfast casserole.  For a change, we sometimes sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the bread topping about 15 minutes before it is done and ready to serve.  Almost like french toast on top and adds a whole new flavor to the dish.

Wow...we loved this recipe.  I made this exactly as written.  Cooked some hashbrowns on the side to go with the casserole...i didn't add the hashbrowns to the casserole as other's suggested.    Even the leftovers are amazingly good....maybe even better.  Definately will be making this again.

Made 1/2 the recipe (for 4 servings) and it turned out a bit dry.  The bread seemed to just be croutons on the top.  I think it needed more eggs.  But, it was tasty and had a lot of great ingredients for a filling breakfast.  Will try hash browns next time.

Delicious and easy.  I substituted 1/2 C egg substitute for two of the eggs, and reduced fat colby/jack cheese.  You never knew it was reduced fat.

I found this in my inbox on a morning that I had impromtu guests for breakfast.  I used the hashbrown idea and it was delicious!  Kids loved it, adults loved it.  I did use extra eggs (approx 5 extra per recipe) since the pan it said to use was a 11 x 8 and I used a 13 x 9.  It took longer to cook than the recipe said, but that was probably due to the extra eggs and that I made a double recipe and they were stacked in the oven.  Give it a try!

I doubled this recipe and substituted hashbrowns for toast.  It was really good and everyone at work liked it.  For me, it wasn't spank-your-mama-good, so I had to give it 4 stars.  I would've liked something a bit creamier.  That's kinda what I was expecting with the gravy mix.  It was a tad dry for me, but still good nonetheless.

Excellent!  Used Spicy JimmyDean sausage, a mixture of cheddar/jack and pepper jack cheeses to spice it up a bit (we love spice!).  Made the original version with bread on top, sprinkled w/salt, pepper & paprika, and drizzled with butter.  The bread baked up light, crispy and a beautiful golden brown.  Loved it!! Thanks Kristin!***Follow-up note***: If you're going to want to re-heat leftovers, you may want to go with the hashbrowns on top.  The bread became soggy and reminded me more of stuffing than a breakfast dish.

This was a hit with everyone! I used turkey sausage and replaced some of the eggs with egg whites- no one could tell. I also used thawed, shredded hash browns O'Brien instead of the toast and upped the cook temp to 350.

I made this for our S.S. class, and it got rave reviews.  As some of the others did, I added mushrooms, garlic salt, put the bread on the bottom, and added 1/2 cup more milk than it called for.  I made it up the night before to let it set all night. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious as written. I left out the optional butter and paprika. Since I had some leftover, I used asiago cheese bread. This would be great with mushrooms and even sliced tomatoes.

This was good. I have made this both ways both toped with bread and with some fried crispy crowns and put them on top and both have turned out very good. My secret is the sage sausage, it really makes the difference.

I thought it was pretty bland.  Followed the recipe to a tee. Our family has made another sausage breakfast casserole for years but I wanted to try something new.  It just didn't have any kick to it.

This was very good. I didn't have any gravy mix so I just left it out. I added some mushrooms and instead of paprika I sprinkled the bread with French Onion dip mix.  Fantastic breakfast!

I made this the day before, so it was in the refrigerator for almost a full day. It turned out great.  I used what cheese I had on hand which was Mozarella.  My husband even commented that it turned out good.  Will be making this again.

I think is a dish that tastes better reheated because I was very disappointed when we ate it shortly after it was cooked. The flavours seem to meld more when refrigerated overnight. Next time I'll use shredded potato instead of the bread because I found the bread very dry; maybe it would taste better at the bottom of the casserole? Definite keeper for when you've got company for brunch.

Made this for dinner as a change of pace. From the reviews I thought this would be the best breakfast casserole I'd ever eaten, but I have to say I was disappointed. This was nothing special. It was tasty and we did eat it, but I didn't really care for the green onions nor could I taste the gravy mix. Hubby really liked it though, so who knows I might make it again.

I love this recipe.  I added half of a green pepper and about 1/4 cup of diced tomatoes to the meat/onion mixture.  I also added two more eggs (eight total).  I used hashbrowns instead of bread.  It was a hit!

Loved it! I took the advice of others, and topped the casserole with shredded hashbrowns. I did cook the potatoes before adding to the casserole. I didn't have enough sausage, so I added some bacon. I also added 3 hatch green chiles...thanks to my aunt in New Mexico! (Love those things, once you've had 'em, you'll never want canned green chiles again!)I added garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt, pepper and sweet basil. And I omitted the butter. Also, the package of gravy mix I had was 4.5 oz, so I added a bit more milk. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

Ugh, this was WAY to greasy for all four of us, with the fried hash browns atop.   The toast would probably be the better way to go, to keep the grease down and not ruin the wonderful egg part of it. (Although, the country gravy mix didn't really give any additional flavor. You could save yourself the $1.50 and just add a bit of flour to thicken / fluff up those eggs)  Had links, instead of bulk sausage - so just chopped them up.  3 Green onions, Red and Green pepper, and white onions. 7 Eggs (made in a 9X13).  3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup milk.   A bit more SHARP cheddar. And, cayenne instead of paprika.

I loved this recipe. I made it today for our treats club at work.  I took some suggestions from the reviews and used the shredded potatoes for the top and used a combo of spicy and mild Italian sausages. I also created a vegetarian one using the cubed potatoes and some additional salt and pepper to add some flavor. 

I had to cook this for probably about 40 minutes longer than the recipe said, but the result was worth it!  The treats were gone faster than I had ever seen! I cooked the sausage the night before and mixing everything together in the morning went super fast.  Love this recipe, I'll make it again and again.

I made this recipe Christmas morning. We didn't have sausage so I used bacon instead. It was a big hit but needed more. Everyone loved it! I Will have to double the recipe next year!!

this was amazing recipe and so much easier and cleaner than having to use the stove. it was the only dish served that was devoured by everyone at the party. I definitely took the advice of others and used hashbrowns instead of bread. next time i would prefer it to be spicier.

This recipe was a hit with my family.  I didn't have the sausage on hand so I just cut up 1 lb. smoked sausage to substitute.  It was great!

My family LOVED this casserole.  My son is pretty picky about his food, so when we find something that he will request second helpings - it's definately a keeper.  I also used the hashbrowns instead of the bread for the casserole.

Easy to make and really does include all the best breakfast ingredients!  It was delicious!  I served it with fresh fruit and got rave reviews.  The toast does not re-heat well in the microwave and I will try the hash browns on top next time, as some of the other reviews have stated.

FABULOUS!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 size glass dish.  No surprises in this dish except how good it was.  It came out layered, not soggy.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!  Delicious with homemade Salsa.

This recipe is excellent! I did tweak a bit. I made with Sage Sausage and Hash Browns instead of bread. Might try onions and peppers next time. Will make this again. Also freezes well.

Followed recipe exactly, except I assembled it the night before and baked it in the morning.  I had to extend the baking time by 20 minutes or so.  To me, something was just not right.  Didn't like the flavor. Husband wouldn't even try it.  I think if I omitted the bread and tried hashbrowns as other reviews said, it might me ok.  But then, you'd have a totally different recipe.  I won't attempt this one again.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  

I added tater tots instead of bread cubes.  You can also get creative and use a variety of cheeses and veggies.

I've made several egg casseroles over the years, and this is one of the easiest and best!  We had weekend guests and I tried this for the first time.  I began the prep the night before, just adding the egg mixture & bread in the a.m. before baking.  I switched the quantities for water and milk, tho.  Mine took about 50 min. to bake.  Everyone LOVED it.  thanks for the recipe!!

Mmmmmm - this casserole was so good!  I picked it from 5 other breakfast casseroles to try and am glad I did.  The country gravy powder mixed in with the eggs was a smart idea and gave it so much flavor.  Everyone would like this!

Made this recipe for a group of hungry softball guys playing an all night tournament.  They LOVED it.  I omitted the onion (one of the guys hates them) and used a casserole cheese blend and the cheddar cheese.  Sprinkled VERY lightly with the paprika.  Several of the guys asked for the recipe.

This is a good recipe.  I added a layer of fried potatoes on the bottom then put the sausage on top of that along with the egg & bread on top.  The guys at worked loved it.

I took this dish to a teacher breakfast and it was quickly gobbled up! I did, however, make some changes. I used vidalia onion instead of green (personal preference), used half skim/half buttermilk, and I left the bread completely off until right before the casserole goes in the oven. It gives it a nice toasty crunch. The spices in the gravy mix make this an outstanding dish!

Good. Seemed like too much sausage and not enough onion to me.  I was expecting the gravy part to be weird but it wasn't.  I will make this again and just do a little adjusting (green pepper would also be good).

This is an excellent recipe!  I loved how easy it was and it was a hit at an office party.  I did not put toast on top.  I laid a can of crescent rolls on top.  It came out beautifully.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Wow this was a hit!  Try adding a bit of maple syrup to the sausage after cooking it through...adds a nice sweet touch to the casserole.  My guests raved about it!

Very good.  Definitely will make again.  I ran out of paprika, so I seasoned with some dill.  Probably changed the flavor slightly, but I like the combination of eggs and dill.  I'll remember this one for holidays.

I thought this was a great casserole for spur of the moment. Most of these types of casseroles, you need to let sit overnight. My family loved it. I mixed white and whole wheat bread for the topping.

Good, but...Used hashbrowns on top and they overpowered everything else. Lighten up or skip entirely. Use French bread. Used wonder and wasn’t good. Use good amount of French bread. Add a couple extra eggs.

An absolute favorite for us. It is requested for every "occasion" breakfast, like anniversaries and birthdays. We have found the cooking time here to be far off, at least for our oven. It needs at least an hour to set in the middle. My kids prefer it without the green onions, and my hubs and I don't detect much of a difference, so we usually make it that way. **FYI, I just used the concept of this recipe to use up a bunch of leftover pancakes. used maple sausage for the base, the cheddar and eggs (no gravy mix), and topped it with chunks of pancake instead of bread. drizzled it with maple syrup and butter. HOT . So good.

Made two batches of this for Xmas Day breakfast...there was not a crumb left!  Everyone commented on how great it was.  Prepped the night before, so it was super easy to pop in the oven, while opening presents.  Note:  Used Jimmy Dean Maple sausage....it added a bit of difference to the flavor that was great!

Made 2 9x13 pans of this for Christmas brunch, one pan with sage flavored sausage and one with maple flavored.  Each person had a sausage preference, but everyone loved the dish and
gave it the highest rating. this is the new go to brunch dish! 
Served with fruit, juice, and cinnamon rolls.

Thought this was very good but I did add the shredded hash brown potatoes as others suggested. Definitely season and at least partially cook the  hash-brown potatoes. Will definitely make again.

I loved it, did use potatoes instead of the bread.  Baking time was closer to 50 minutes.  Flavor was very good and it did not dry out as many breakfast casseroles do.

The casserole was fabulous! I put the bread crumbs in a bag with melted butter and the remaining cheese from the package and shook it to coat. Omgosh it added the crunch. Yum.

I made this for a pot luck breakfast. Got many compliments. The changes I made: I used dried onion bits instead of green onion. I also topped the casserole with tater tots instead of bread. Will make again.

I have made this at least a dozen times and it's a big  hit each time. This last time I made it I had to make a few adjustments because I didn't have everything. I browned some hash browns and placed them in the bottom of my greased dish and then sprinkled with green onion and cheese. I did not have the sausage or gravy but, I did have left over sausage gravy. So, I mixed 1/2 cup milk with 2 cups of prepared sausage gravy and added the 6 eggs. Then cubed up the bread, sprinkled with cheese and paprika and threw it in the oven for 40 minutes. Came out wonderful! There is nothing wrong with the original recipe,I just had to work with what I had.

I made this recipe this morning, I did tweak it a bit though. I put breakfast sausage at the bottom cut up potatoes in the middle  andouille sausage on top of that poured the 6 eggs over the top then layered the cheese on top of that and then I put the cut up pieces of bread. It went in the oven for about an hour and it was delicious I loved it I'm so glad I made it!

Being lactose intolerant I had to adjust. 
 I also used leftover grands biscuits in place of the loaf bread.  I cut them in half and lined the bottom of the dish with them. Then I added the cooked/crumbled sausage, poured the eggs over all, refrigerated for a few hours and then cooked.  It was delicious!!!

We loved this recipe!  We did add white onion (we love onion!) and more green onions as well as mushrooms.  We also used links of Johnsonville Original sausages and added an extra egg...all turned our marvelously!   We didn't add paprika because we didn't have any and it is mentioned as optional.  At any rate, I would recommend upping the ingredients by at least a quarter because the serving sizes, otherwise, will be a wee bit small...but just our opinion!  :o)  No salt is called for and you will NOT need any.

I'm one of those that doesn't like to change a recipe until I've made it once. However, I wanted to make this for guests and I knew they would prefer the hash browns like some others used instead of bread. It was very yummy. The second morning I heated up the leftovers and my husband asked if I could make gravy to put over it. I had some bacon grease, so I made gravy with it and let me tell you, that poured over a serving of the casserole took it from yummy to YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! Do yourself a favor and try this upgrade!

Super easy & super yummy. I actually forgot to make it the night before but it made no difference. I added extra green onion & extra cheese & did drizzle melted butter on top. I'll be making this one again.

This was definitely a different breakfast casserole recipe and it intrigued me to try it out.  I really liked it but my husband not so much.  So that is why the split down the middle with the stars.  The only thing I did differently was to make my own gravy instead of the packaged stuff.  Otherwise I really liked the sausage, egg, gravy, and toasted bread combo.  I think it would be good with hashbrowns like many others have done with it.  Thank you for the recipe!  I enjoyed trying and making it!

I made this casserole for Christmas morning for a large gathering and it was amazing. Unlike many breakfast casseroles that are dry when cooked, this one stayed moist. I used Cuban bread on top, otherwise made it exactly as specified. Although the melted butter drizzled on top of the bread is stated is optional, don't leave it off. It makes a savory toasted topping. I can't wait to make this again. The only negative is that there were no leftovers.

My husband brought home a loaf of crusty bread and I didn't want to use it to make the same ole garlic bread so I went in search of a recipe to use it.
I found this recipe and I did change it up but I used it as a base recipe. First I browned my sausage and put it into a 13x9 inch baking dish. Added the green onion to that and mixed it up. I then cubed up the bread into 1" pieces and tossed it with the sausage and onion. I then whisked 8 eggs with 1/2 a cup of milk and poured it over the bread and let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours. I skipped adding the gravy mix and water that was directed in the recipe. I then baked it for about 35-40 minutes at 350. Topped it with some cheddar cheese in the last several minutes. This turned out pretty good. My bread was much too crusty for this though.  We had some tough pieces throughout. It didn't have enough eggs and enough time to soak up the eggs to become soft, which I think was the goal but that's okay. It was eaten and my son really enjoyed it.

This recipe is really good!  It's dangerous if your on a diet :) .
The country gravy taste really comes thru. I did make it with Hot Sausage instead of plain and used 6 green onions to spice it up a bit.

This was really a good breakfast casserole! My family loved it!!  The jimmy dean sausage really made the difference. the only thing I added was a little seasoning salt on top of the hash browns. I will definitely make this again.

The casserole was delicious, as others have stated the cook time was off, it needs to bake at least 1.5 hours.  Next time I would cut up the sausage rather than leave them in whole pieces.  Will absolutely make this again.

We loved this recipe!  The only change that we made was to add some hashbrowns to the bottom of the pan with the sausage and green onions (as others recommended).  We also used a 9x13 pan, so as another reviewer suggested, I increased the eggs by 2 and the milk by 1/2c.  The melted butter on top of the bread gives it a wonderful crouton like texture on top.

Made this for the first time for Christmas morning.  It was fabulous, and the whole family loved it!  The only change I made was I used regular onion instead of green onions and threw in 1/4 cup chopped red pepper I wanted to use up from my frig, will definitely make again!

It truly was the best breakfast casserole I've ever ha...Made it to take to my sons' home with all his in-laws and my ex and his wife, they all raved over how moist and tastier it was than what they've had, I think it has to be the sausage gravy mix that did ..you must try it

I've made this several times for our early morning tailgate parties.  We start tailgating at 8am for the noon games and this taste yummy in the morning!!     It does take longer to bake than the recipe says.   I use hot italian sausage and double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan.   For leftovers I make gravy to pour over the top.....even better then.   Thanks for posting.

It was very good.  Agree with others that shredded potatoes are a great choice rather than bread cubes.  I plan to use bulk sausage the next time.  Also you might want to add some salt and pepper.

Easy to make and flavorful.  Would definitely make it again.  I only make breakfast on weekends and it was a nice change from the usual eggs, potatoes, sausage that we tend to eat.

Let me start off by saying I'm not the best cook in the world. With that being said I followed the recipe except for I used a loaf pan because all my other pants were too large. The results was a runny mess. No clue what I did wrong unless it was the pan but it was an "epic fail" as my husband would say!!!!

I will make this again.....I used Hawaiian rolls and peppered gravy envelope and it came out really good. Next time I will use more bread because the cheese and eggs make this a very rich casserole.

My favorite breakfast casserole! I also used turkey sausage, and browned hash browns to put them on top the last 15 minutes of cooking. My husband likes the crunch they add to the rest of the casserole:) I think the gem of this dish is adding the country gravy mix! Absolutely genius!

This was one recipe that I've made where there were no alterations necessary. It was amazing and it did all vanish between the three of us lol. I think the only thing that could've made it any better would have been a little bit of the gravy to put over the top when it was done, but like I said, no alterations needed. Bravo Kristin!

BAM!!  Picky Skinny Teenage Kids going back for 3rd Helpings! Need I say more?  I made for Mother's Day.  Doubled recipe so one could be carried to church.  Used 2 disposable tin pans so no cleanup.  Also, casseroles aren't typically a manly item to be carrying into a class of hunters :-) so added ham and bacon to the mix as picture shows. Cut the bread slices down to 3 in each instead of 6. Divided package of Hashbrowns into thirds using 1/3 as crust for each tin pan and splitting the remaining third to add to top of each long after 30 minutes of cooking for the final 15-20 minutes.  Added some shredded cheese (that I'l set to the side) after baking was complete to melt on top of the hashbrowns and make look more appetizing. The one thing I will say is I'd like to meet the person who can prepare all ingredients in 15 minutes - always seems to take me at least twice the time to everything in place...  That said, Highly Recommend and will be making again.  Thanks for the great ideas in other reviews!!

This is a often served recipe when company comes to town. I have made it as is and it is good but I have made some changes that work nicely. I make a crispy cooked hashbrown bottom crust (first coat the bottom of pan with light coat of olive oil), and I make real sausage gravy instead of using the package. I pour this over hash browns, then put on the other ingredients. I cube a whole grain bread and I make sure to tap it down a bit into the the casserole. Comes out very tasty

Very good.  I made this in a 12x18 pan using 2 cups of milk, 2 packets of gravy mix, 16 servings of hash browns, and 20eggs.  I warmed the egg mixture a bit to reduce baking time.  Turned out great.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was pretty darn good. I tried to cut it in half, which was pretty easy except for the gravy part. I also made a hash brown crust to put it all in, and instead of cubed bread, I took frozen biscuits (they take longer to cook then the canned type) quartered them, and topped the whole thing off with that. It was beautiful...almost too pretty to eat. It was a tad dry for my taste, so the next time I will add the full amount of water, milk and gravy mix to it.

This was good, although it took longer to bake than estimated. Would make some veggie additions in the future to add flavour. Replaced bread with "smiley fries" on top which delighted the little ones! Will make again for busy school day breakfasts. Thank you!

Very yummy. Had to make changes based on what I had.  Here's what I did: Used diced hot dog buns toasted in oven.  Used for bottom layer.  Then strained left over sausage gravy to separate.  Layered sausage (about 1.5 cups) then cheese.  Whisked 8 eggs then added to 2 cups of gravy.  Poured on top of casserole.  Added more cheese.  Browned hash browns in oven.  Baked casserole at 400 for 40 minutes (or until almost firm) then toped with crispy hash browns and finished baking.  Very similar to original recipe but made changes based on others reviews and my inventory :).  Yum.

My husband and 6-year-old always enjoy this meal, which we frequently eat for dinner. The ingredients are easy to find and put together, and the butter-drizzled bread on top gives a really nice crunch to the dish.

Aside from layering sausage, cheese & onion for the bottom 2 layers like a lasagna, I followed this recipe to a Tee and it is delicious! I made this for my mother-in-law, for husband and I, I'd spice it up a bit more.

Great change from our usual frittata's or strada's. I did make a couple of tweaks though...I omitted the water and added a full cup of milk, made scratch gravy (great leftovers for biscuits), used bacon and pancetta, and added mushrooms, red pepper and spinach. I think my husband actually licked his plate!!

This was Yummy! I reserved my pan drippings from the sausage and used it to fry 1 chopped onion ( I didn't have green onions). I also substituted 1 - 32 oz pkg southern style hash browns instead of the bread. Make sure to fry these in the remaining drippings, and season well with salt and pepper. Works well to thaw sausage and potatoes the night before. This took a few more minutes to cook (50 total ), maybe because  no bread to soak up the moisture? My family loved it! Will definitely make this again.

I rarely comment on recipes, but I do read the reviews for hints on tweaking the recipe. We like our food on the spicy side.  In the case of this recipe, I was HAPPY not to have hash browns on hand.  There are a lot of good breakfast casseroles with hash browns, but I suggest going with the author and leave them out.  The bread cubes toast up wonderfully.  Awesome recipe..oh yeah...I did make a change in response to the spicy factor.  We used chorizo instead of breakfast sausage.

I've made this twice, and my family loves it! I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage and a bit more green onions--maybe 3 versus the one. I skip the drizzled butter part and it comes out fine. I also found that you need to cook it longer than 40 minutes for the eggs to really set up.

Absolutely Delish!  I was in a hurry and didn't have hash browns so I ended up making this recipe as its with Sourdough Bread.  I even put the cheese in the middle as directed, I wasn't sure about this, but it came out delicious!  I'm glad I didn't have hash browns and that I followed directions exactly or I wouldn't have been able to see how good this recipe was is.  Give it a try!  I must say that the sourdough bread made it taste great!  ENJOY! This fantastic recipe.

Of the many breakfast casseroles I've tried, this is a huge winner. Add some extra panache with chopped asparagus and crimini mushrooms and substitute the bread with brioche or slightly stale croissant. Or go all the way country and use waffles! Drizzle a little maple syrup on that as it comes out of the oven. Yum!

This was yummy.... I added a few spices to liven it up a bit but no major changes needed... I did however use a bisquick topping in place of the bread and it was delish :)

Wonderful!

I made this for my husband's birthday, and we could not stop eating it!

The only changes I made were to use Morningstar Farms Breakfast Sausage, and a batch of homemade country gravy, since I'm a vegetarian.  I topped it with Parmesan and a bit of mozzarella, and sprinkled the top with smoked paprika and onion salt.

Really great breakfast casserole.  I highly recommend topping with the hash browns( I used the southwestern frozen hash browns)  Also, can not wait to substitute the sausage with ham or bacon and some red pepper flakes.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this, using the hash browns.  Very good!  My husband sprinkled a little Toneys seasoning on his.  Next time, I'll use a little minced jalapeno peppers, and possibly some mushrooms.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Great flavor!!  Goes in the books as a favorite.  I have made a number of egg bakes and this one is my fiance's favorite!  I used regular bread and broke it into small pieces for the top and used shredded cheddar, colby and sharp cheddar cheeses.

Wonderful recipe. I'm updating this review because I made the casserole the night before. I did decide to use shredded hash browns on the top, though and omit the bread. I cooked and added the hash browns the morning I baked the casserole. Again, delicious and sooooo easy!

Made this for a work potluck.  It was great.  We have some picky eaters so I used some dried minced onion instead of the green onion.  I will definately make this again.  Maybe add somemore veggies, peppers and mushrooms.  Might try ham instead of sausage.  But overall a very good recipe that I will make again.

I loved this casserole. The taste reminded me a bit of sausage stuffing so next time I'll try making it with hashbrowns instead of bread, as others have tried. We topped it with some hot sauce for a little extra kick!

I followed the recipe precisely. Turned out nice...I had to bake it longer than the recipe said.  I thought it was pretty tasty.. husband isn't real fond of any breakfast casserole, so I can't go by his comments. He ate it.... I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

At work, we have potluck night and everyone brings a dish.  The theme was breakfast foods, and I used this recipe and it got rave reviews.  The only thing I changed was using Potato Bread.  A very good dish.
