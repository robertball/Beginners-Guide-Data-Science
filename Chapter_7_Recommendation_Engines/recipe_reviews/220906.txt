I'm a Charlestonian by birth and this is the best shrimp and grits recipe I've found!  Even folks who thought they wouldn't like grits and/or shrimp devoured this dish!

I've been a big fan of garlic cheese grits and have tried a few different versions over the years. I haven't tried this one yet but can tell it will be great ... particularly introducing the BBQ'd shrimp into the mix to make it an entree in and of itself. Only one thing I will do differently which I have found adds extra flavor to the grits ... substitute chicken broth vs. the water to cook the grits in.

I tried this recipe last night and it is a winner, however, I would not make it again as a main dish.  Rather, it would be an excellent side dish, and last night we thought it would be great for a surf 'n turf dinner... a side dish with a nice steak.

Very good, very easy. Only change I'd make is substituting a good quality, low vinegar hot sauce for the barbecue sauce. I've never had shrimp and grits any other way. This also makes a large quantity of really filling food. It's a good idea to pair it with a lighter veggie dish like salad or steamed and lightly seasoned green beans. My husband and I LOVED it!

My husband couldn't say enough about how tasty this meal was! I skipped the bacon, onions, and BBQ sauce. I sprinkled my shrimp with Cajun seasoning. My grits (polenta) had sour cream and butter in addition to the cheese. Plus a little garlic powder. They were smooth and creamy! Didn't take long to whip up a delicious meal!

This was very easy to prepare and was very tasty. The only thing I will do different next time is add some diced jalape√±o to spice it up a bit.
