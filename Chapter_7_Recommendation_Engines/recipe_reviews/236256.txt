I love this - it's like a virgin Bloody Mary, but hot, so it's soothing for a sore throat, or just warm and comforting on a cold day. A few hints: 
1) Tomato juice is extremely high in sodium, so use celery seed rather than celery salt. 
2) No need to dirty a blender and saucepan, just pour low-sodium tomato (or vegetable) juice in a cup, add other ingredients to taste, and pop it in the microwave until it gets hot. 
3) If you like Indian food, try adding a little rasam powder - it's delicious.
