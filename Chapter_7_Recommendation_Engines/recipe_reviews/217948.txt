I love this salad!  I love fresh kale!  This salad has a nice bite and looks pretty in the serving bowl.  The only reason i dont give it a five is because my family thought the vinegar was too much.

I love this salad!  I love kale, and this is a great recipe for enjoying it raw.  The dressing is very tasty.  I used a mix of organic baby kales, easy to prepare because I only had to open the bag.  Seeding the pomegranate does take some time, but you can by the seeds in a package, so that could make prep faster. Very easy recipe, very healthy, and very delicious! Thank You!

Personally, instead of vinegar my family uses freshly squeezed lemons! So good!

Poms. were not available in my local store, so I substitued fresh mozarella cheese diced.  Only used 3 Tbs of each vinegar based on other reviews and mixed olive oil and grapesedd oil.  Yummy!

I thought kale would be bitter, but it isn't.  Very fresh salad with a great texture and flavour.  Very good if you are dieting.

I liked the textures and flavors, but the dressing to was too strong and too plentiful. I'll try it again with a more mellow, bottled dressing.

I tried this recipe tonight with the modification of 1 less Tablespoon of each type of vinegar.  Still, it was a little too much vinegar.  Next time, I will make it with 3 Tab. rice vinegar and 3 Tab. balsamic.  Other than too much vinegar (and I love vinegar), this salad was very tasty and looked appealing, too.  I added some chopped avocado to mine, which went very well.

Suggest putting the dressing on and letting it sit for an hour or two before serving.  The salad was much better the next day.

I bought a bottle of red wine vinaigrette instead of making it.  The salad was tasty, healthy, and I liked the texture.  I will be making this again.
