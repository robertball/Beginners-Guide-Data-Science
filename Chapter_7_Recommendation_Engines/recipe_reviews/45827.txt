I liked this meal, but the wife and kids did not.  The kids liked the potatoes but not the meat (the Worcestershire taste I think).  My wife was unhappy that the potatoes were only partially cooked (even after an extended baking time).  I think if I were to make it again I would bake it covered with foil for 45min then uncovered for the last 15min(this is how I cook my scalloped ham and potatoes and the potatoes are always tender).  This could be a great meat and potatoes recipe with some adjustments.

I liked this recipe a lot, however, you definately need to drain the meat.  To cut down on the grease, I used half a cup of cheddar cheese and half a cup of monteray jack cheese.(cheddar cheese is very oily).  As far as the potatoes go, first I pre-cooked the meat with onions, fresh garlic, and chili sauce (replacing the tomato sauce).  I then refrigerated the meat for about an hour.  Then I sliced the potatoes very thin and cooked the whole thing together for 1hr. The first half hour, I kept it covered with aluminum foil, and then took it off the last half hour.  The potoes came out very tender.  My husband and kids loved it.

from Kattjovi I have been reading a lot of reviews where people have said they need to drain the fat from the meat. This is an Australian Recipe, and we don't have a high fat content in our mince steak, so we don't need to drain it. I apologise to o/s cooks, I did not realise this when I posted the recipe, and yes Ketchup is Tomato Sauce in Australia. I think this recipe is quite versatile, you can add whatever herbs etc you like, you could even spice it up with a bit of chili powder! That's the fun of cooking,(I think) experimenting! Enjoy!

This is good and filling, as claimed.  It's basically "shepherd's pie meets scalloped potatoes".  Good, plain comfort food, but if you are looking for something with more zing, you may want to add a bit of spice or chili sauce to the meat when you cook it.  Make sure to cut the potatoes really thin, too, or else you'll be cooking it for a long(er) time!

Delicioso! I drained the beef. I also used the "soy substitute" recipe from this site instead of Worcheshire Sauce. I tried 5 potatoes since I used 2lbs of beef but that was still too much. Suggest 4 potatoes. I double the sauce since I did have double the meat. Also cooked with foil on for 1 hr and uncovered for 20 more minutes. Perfection!

This is quite a filling casserole.  I baked it a little longer and some of the potatoes were not quite cooked.  Give it some extra time in the oven.

I found this recipe very bland. It also was greasy as the recipe did not call for draining the ground beef/onion mixture. It also took longer to cook the potatoes to doneness than the recipe claimed. I won't fix this again.We ended up making burgers on the grill.

good recipe,, but to add a little more flavour add a tea spoon of dried mixed herbs to the mince beef,, and if you want a hotter flavour a few diced chilles

A fairly good casserole, but could use some tweaking. Even with 1/8" potato slices, took almost twice the cooking time to get the potatos done.  Adding some dried herbs to the beef helped give more flavor.  I also added some green beans and mixed veggies to the cheese sauce.  If I were to make again, I would add more cheese to the sauce, as it's lacking a bit with only 1C and more beef.  I would also cover and bake for about 45 min, then baked uncovered for about 15.  Baking uncovered left the potatos on top burned on the edges and some turned gray.

A little bland, so next time would add a little something extra. Maybe a can of tomatoes simmered off and some other herbs, seasoning. Also needed to extend the cooking time by a mile for the potatoes to be cooked. Filling and easy, though. Will be keeping and amending a little. :)

My family loved this recipe.  I pre boiled the potatoes and left out the tomato sauce. Buttered the bottom of non-stick pan, placed the potatoes in, then the beef mixture, Sauteed portabella mushrooms, pre-partially steamed brocolli, and covered in the sauce.  Then I sprinkled with French Fried Onions to kick it up a bit and add some crunch after reading other reviews about it being bland.  Baked for only about 15 minutes.  Yummy!

This was a really good basic recipe that can be easily modify to suit your tastes and get creative with.  I used the basic recipe and added carrots and used fresh mushrooms. To give it more kick and flavor, I added about 2 Tablespoons of Frank's hot sauce and some Herbs De Provence, about 1/4 teaspoon of paprika in addition to the Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, salt/pepper. I also added in some irish style pork sausage to the beef to add to the flavors. I drained as much grease as I could before baking. I also added a little more cheese to the cheese sauce and instead of 1 cup of cheese, I used 1 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar and mozzarella. Next time I will add in some asparagus.  I put salt/pepper/herbs de provence over the bottom and top layers of potato (and sliced carrots). She doesn't mention greasing the pan, which I did lightly with some olive oil. My husband absolutely loved this meal.

Thanks for an excellent hearty recipe. But based on the previous reviews I made a few changes. I added a few garlic cloves, one vegetable cube, a full cup of tomato sauce and some herbs to the ground beef. When layering in the baking dish I placed the second layer of potatoes (I also added thinly sliced carrots and frozen corn and peas) between the minced meat to help it cook better. I recommend baking this covered for a good hour then removing the cover for another 10minutes. I just had leftovers for lunch and it was better this time round.

We all loved this, but I did add extra seasoning - a layer of garlic salt on top of the beef mixture before placing potatoes on top.

This was horrible. I too sliced the potatoes really thin, and they were still firm after cooking it for more than 40 minutes. Plus is was so so soupy. I think 2 cups of milk is way too much liquid.
I probably wont make this again. Sorry.

This recipe was so delicious that my whole family (including small children) loved it! I did add peas to the meat mixture, and found that it worked quite well with the recipe. This was so well loved that I plan to add it to my regular rotation. Thank you.

Thank you!  My mum makes this all the time and I'd decided I had to make it for dinner but couldn't find the recipe - not on any aussie sites!  Was yummy and very filling.  I added garlic to mince and used 2 tbls tomato sauce, skipped the mushrooms and instead of layering cheese sauce I put it on top with a sprinkling of cheese to finish.  Microwaved the sliced potato to start to ensure it was cooked and came out perfect.

Fabulous comfort dish suitable for the cooler months. Like others I would suggest either draining the meat after cooking or cooking for longer to get rid of excess moisture. This has a high fat content with the butter - also like others I suggest using half of the butter quantity.  I plan to cook this again with these slight amendments but in summary - a fabulous, filling cooler weather dish, economical and quick to prepare.

Such a great recipe. My whole family including picky children will eat this and ask for seconds!!  My only advice is that you need to make sure the potatoes are very thinly sliced to ensure it is cooked throughly.

This recipe is great if you are looking for a simple but filling dish.  Instead of peeling and cutting potatoes I used a bag of frozen cubed potatoes.  I am sure you could use hashbrowns too.  It saved some time and cooked up quickly.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. We use a potato peeler to "peel" off thin slices. It's faster than trying to slice them with a knife, and we don't have a problem with them being too thick. We don't always put the tomato sauce in, and we usually use fresh mushrooms (if we have them), and we always drain the meat. We also add spices when cooking the meat--usually a little chilli powder and some garlic powder (or fresh minced garlic)--to kick it up a little bit. This is definitely our favorite recipe from this site so far though!

This is DELICIOUS.  It takes a while to prepare, but it is well worth the wait.  The only thing that I would strongly suggest is to drain the ground beef mixture before pouring it into the dish, otherwise you are left with too much grease and the sauce doesn't set as nicely.  I made the dish for my fiancee and I, and he loved it too--I found out that it is the same thing as a Serbian dish called Musaka.  It's filling, tasty, and a definite keeper!

We found it a bit bland, and it took way more than the specified time to cook.  We sliced our potatoes very thinly using a mandoline slicer, and it still took nearly an hour and a half of baking for the potatoes to be mostly tender.  Some were still crunchy after all that time.  If I make it again, I'll add some seasonings to jazz it up a bit, and I'll partially cook my potatoes before baking, to reduce the baking time.

Overall we liked it. However the potato was a bit undercooked, possibly because it was either too thick or the cooking time was too short. Next time I will cook it for an hour until it gets really golden. I added spring onions on top, used only half an onion, added 2 cut up pieces of bacon with the mince and didn't add any mushrooms. 

Looking forward to round 2!

Just all right.  We didn't find this to be all that great.  It was edible, but I doubt I will make it again.

This recipe should say to drain the meat, but that is a common practice when added ground meat to anything. I didn't really understand the 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce so I just added some ketchup. I eyeballed the milk until I thought the cheese sauce had a good consistency-not too soupy. Try adding about 1/2 tablespoon of blue cheese chunks to the cheese sauce (adjust to taste). It perks up the flavor of the cheese sauce. We cooked this for about 45 minutes uncovered and it was fine. This will become our winter regular. Thank you!

Very good and hearty recipe.  I solved the potato problem by using canned sliced new potatoes.

My husband and I really like this meal and are looking forward to having it regularly.  Next time I am going to keep the potato slices in hot water or cook them because a few of the slices remained cold.  Adding peas (as some other reviewers have said) does sound interesting, but not essential because we think this meal does stand well on it's own.

This was pretty good, but maybe not the best choice for a weeknight. There are a lot of steps to this, especially when you're already tired.

Changes I made:
Left the skin on the potatoes.
Added thyme to the beef mixture.
Added Romano cheese to the cheese sauce.
Used fresh sliced baby bellas instead of canned mushrooms.
And next time, I would leave off the extra butter on top - mine pooled up into little greasy puddles on top of the potatoes and was a little unappetizing.

Had to bake these over an hour to get the potatoes tender. MY hubby liked this dish much more than me. I found it to be a little flat.

Like other reviews suggested, I drained the meat (a must). I added two large crushed cloves of fresh garlic and a slight amount of cayenne pepper to the meat to liven it up. I used the Worchestire sauce, if at least only a few dashes.... it made the meat slightly tangy which was perfect. If using large potatoes you only need 4. Definitely season the top layer of potatoes not just with salt and pepper but also add some onion powder and/or some garlic powder. This made all the layers come together. I would imagine it being quite bland if you don't. My 11 and 13 year old girls loved it. Bake in a deep dish for one whole hour (covered--which cooked the potato slices just right) or else the sauce will bubble over and mess up your oven. Or place a cookie sheet under the dish.

I've made this a couple of times. The second time I added extra seasoning as I did find it slightly bland the first time, although my husband liked it. I'll use the recipe again and continue to alter to our tastes.

After reading the reviews I added garlic salt and garlic pepper to the meat after draining the meat.  I didn't slice the potatoes very thin; I just precooked them a little before assembling all.

This recipe was pretty boring in taste, especially considering how long it takes to make and the preparation involved. I thought I sliced the potatos thin enough, but I guess not since it took an hour in the oven and they were still not finished. I ended up throwing out the who meal. I am not sure if I will make this again. I don't know how to slice the potatos any thinnner.
