I made 2 batches of this. The first i followed the recipe to a "T" and came out with pickled mush. The second time i left the squash raw and it was fantastic. I would recommend not cooking the squash.

I haven't used this recipe. But have used one like this in some ways. I too had mush. What I do, is let mine just strike good boil and can them. never have a problem. I love pickled squash..I never do the 10 min thing..Makes a mess...Yummmy

This is a bit too sweet for my taste, but still good. To those reviewers that felt it came out mushy, the key is to only boil the brine. When it says to bring to a boil again: drain the vegetables, boil the liquid, spoon the vegetables into the jars, and pour the boiled liquid over them. This is a great method for cucumber pickles as well, because it allows the vegetables to release all their little bubbles, and then allows you to boil off any impurities that may spoil the final product.

Great!  Followed brine exactly & wouldn't change-  otherwise sliced 10 cups yellow squash thinly on mandolin, one large candy onion, no g.pepper.  Didn't measure salt, just sprinkled canning salt to squash/onion mixture then tossed occasioanally for almost 2 hours, drained, packed jars, then added boiled brine.  Heated lids and allowed to seal without coldpacking, period.  I know some would say this is unsafe, but we ate a pint tonight and will refrigerate and eat the rest soon.  These turned out great, like bread and butter and we love!  Thank you!

I've made these three times now.  In the first, I used the recipe for sugar, but in the second two versions I reduced it by half.   I;ve used scalliosn and red pepper in place of green pepper and onions.   Also, added a little more mustard seed and accidentally used celery salt instead of celery seed in one batch.  Both versions worked out very well.  I agree with the previous reviewers who state to leave the squash raw.  I even cut it a little thicker than normal to make sure it stays crisp.

EXCELLENT be sure to do the vegetable's raw. I've done several batch's and changed things per different taste for different parties I do... one I did cider vinegar with hot peppers and garlic cloves. hubby loved these's and asked for more this year also did as is recipe alittle too sweet but worked well for a wedding party that requested them. also work's really well as a relish... just shred zucchini and follow recipe for sweet relish. for dill use no sugar and add fresh dill and alittle garlic. if you don't want the seeds in your mix putthem into a cheese cloth tied tight and boil with the liquid alot of it what do you like add to the liquid and go from there.

This recipe is very similar to one that I use to make bread and butter cucumber pickles every summer. It's delicious. I've given several jars away already. It made 6 full pints, although I may have had closer to 3 pounds of squash. Because I knew I had more squash than the recipe calls for, I increased the sugar and vinegar proportionately. We'll be happy to have this in the cellar all winter. Thanks for the recipe.

Love this with my fresh garden yellow summer squash, fresh crop onions and fresh garden carrots.  The carrots add color to the jars.  I slice them in long strips and it looks and tastes great! Try to leave the carrots a little crunchy.  Yummy!!!  I also use apple cider vinegar which gives it additional tangy-ness.

This is a very easy recipe and a great way to use the extra squash. Especially the yellow crookneck that are too mature to use just for steaming. Tastes great!  Can't wait to try it on toasted French bread. 
I too did not boil the mixture after soaking in the pickling brine. Did a 10 minute water bath to can the squash.

Made this for the second time. Canned them in the pressure cooker for food safety. Used yellow squash because I had so much of it to use up. Used Splenda instead of sugar and reduced it by 1 cup. The only thing I added was 5 jalape√±os 2 seeded and 3 unseeded. Not to spicy at all and next batch I will add a little habanero for a little more of the sweet and spicy. Great recipe.

Love the brine flavor.  Did not cook squash. Sliced vegetables very thin using mandoline.  I used 2 cups of sugar. Love this recipe. I use this on salads, sandwiches, or just right out of the jar! Delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
