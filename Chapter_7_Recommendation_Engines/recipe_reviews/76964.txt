A much easier way to combine the ingredients (especially great if you lack a hand mixer) is to cream the butter and sugar; stir in the milk, eggs, and vanilla; then stir in the dry ingredients, sifted together.

Smells like Thanksgiving and goes GREAT with a dollop of COLD, whipped cream!

I baked mine in a bundt pan: about 75 minutes at 350 degrees.

This is without a doubt the best spice cake I've ever made. The spices used are perfect and no one spice overwhelms anything else. It is moist and absolutely delicious. I bake mine in a stoneware fluted pan just because it looks pretty so I have to adjust cooking times~ 50 minutes in the oven and it is done perfectly. I took another reviewer's suggestion and made the "Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site to top it with. That frosting complements this cake perfectly. I double the frosting because you do get quite a large cake and just because it tastes divine! Thank you. *EDIT* I forgot to add that I've seen quite a few complaints about mixing this recipe. What I do with ALL my cakes is keep the wet and dry ingredients separate. For this cake, I beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, added the rest of the wet ingredients one at a time while slowly beating to blend. In another bowl I sifted all the dry ingredients together then added them slowly to the wet bowl and mixed it together by hand with a wooden spoon. Never fails! I give it 4 stars because I did have to make these changes and I'm sure that new cooks don't know that keeping the wet and dry separate for a cake is crucial.

This was almost like the one my mother made in the 1950's.  She simmered 1/2 c. raisens until they were plump, drained the liquid and added them to the recipe. I tried that trick and now I have Mothers recipe. Thanks.  

Sometimes she would frost with caramel icing, sometimes cream cheese icing or sometimes just lay a paper doiley on top and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

First of all, I want to say that the flavor of the spices was wonderful -- absolutely the best combination and amounts I've ever tasted in a spice cake.  I only gave this 3 stars though due to the method and the fact that I felt it lacked some things, such as raisins and nuts.

I read through the entire recipe and was shocked at the instructions on how to put it together.  I stuck with my "tried and true" method where I mixed the all dry ingredients together first, then I creamed the butter and sugar, added the eggs one at a time mixing well after each, added the vanilla and then added the dry ingredients varying with the milk -- dry/milk/dry/milk/dry.  I also plumped 1/4 cup golden raisins and 1/4 cup regular raisins and toasted 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and stirred that in after mixing everything else.

I served this as the Grooms' cake for my sons wedding today and it was a big hit.   Very moist, but still held together.  I recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent spice cake, but stick to the "normal" method of mixing the ingredients.

Extremely moist. Big hit with my family-we ate it while decorating our tree! Baked it in a bunt pan and sifted powdered sugar over the top and it turned out lovely. Very old-fashion-Christmas looking. It is important to follow the directions exactly or else you won't get the moist, fluffy texture.

I made a rich caramel sauce to spoon over this and the final product is absolutely wonderful!!!  The only thing missings is a really good quality french vanilla ice cream and a rich cup of freshly brewed coffee.

I added a cup of raisins that I had soaked in hot water and I also followed a more traditional cake technique of creaming the sugar with the butter (or margarine... which I used), and then adding the eggs and vanilla.  

I added the combined dry ingredients to the sugar/margarine, and then stirred in my milk and raisins.  

Absolutely perfect!!

A definite keeper of a recipe and one well worth serving to guests.

Mixing the butter with the dry ingredients, instead of creaming the butter and sugar together and adding the other wet ingredients, creates a finer crumbed, more tender cake. This kind of a cake can support a heavy frosting.

Although this was the first cake I'd ever tried to make, I found the instructions very easy to follow and had no problems during baking.  I've served it on two seperate occasions and it's always been devoured very, very quickly.  I definitrly recommend it to first-time bakers, or anyone with a love of spice cake in general.  Try adding 1/2 cup of applesauce to make it more moist.

It was very good.  The steps were a bit complicated but I followed them exactly and the batter was perfect.  I made this for a Breakfast Cake.  Next time I think I will make Muffins in my cupcake maker.
Thanks for posting!!

This recipe seemed a little odd to me, maybe because I don't have much experience with cakes, though. I've never cut the butter into dry ingredients except for streusel, so I decided to make this like a regular cake. I creamed the butter and sugar together, added the eggs and vanilla. Then I added the dry ingredients, and finally the milk. I baked in 2 9 inch pans, and the cake was very moist, albeit VERY dense (probable from using a mixer and beating to much). But...it tasted very good. I would make it again, but I will keep looking for the perfect spice cake recipe.

If I could give this recipe a 0, I would. I am a good baker. In fact, I worked at a high end restaurant as a baker for a couple years. I have never had a recipe go so badly as this one. This is the first time I've even bothered to rate/review a recipe on here.

The first attempt at the cake, the batter split. I have no idea how that happened. One second it was good, the next it was split and I had to toss it.

Second attempt... this is just a BAD recipe. This is *NOT* how you make cake batter... it is very strange. The batter was extremely thick but I baked it anyways. I let the cakes sit for about 10 mins after coming out of the oven and then turned one over. The cake immediately fell apart... I tried to piece it back together but it all kept crumbling. Worst cake texture ever. Since this pile of cake was ruined, I tasted it. It tastes okay but it is very sticky... it sticks to the roof of your mouth and has a raw flour taste (probably from the large amount of corn starch and baking powder, I would guess).

Anyways, I suggest moving on to a different recipes. This was just a plain disaster.

This tastes great but a couple of things.  It has a very strong ginger flavor.  I added a caramel icing that helped cut it a bit, but just know when you make it that ginger is the main taste here.

Also, I tried making this into cupcakes; that was a mistake.  They were a bit crunchy on top and didn't hold together inside - they tasted amazing but I think the cake itself was too moist to hold together as a cupcake.  I didn't rate down for it because it wasn't holding itself out as a cupcake recipe - just wanted to mention it for anyone else who might be thinking cupcake for this one.

I'm going to make it again as a proper cake, but am planning to make it sort of a poke cake with caramel running through it with a light coating of chocolate on top - can't wait!

Thanks for this recipe - I'm looking forward to playing with it :)

I've just made this cake for the first time.  The flavour is good, hence the four stars.  However, I have had trouble with the baking time.  After being in the oven (fan assisted) for 40mins at the recommended temperature, the cake was still uncooked in the middle, so I put it back in the oven for increments of 5mins, testing after each additional 5mins. After an hour and ten minutes the cake was cooked through to the middle but had a crunchy, overcooked layer round the outside.  I baked it in a 1kg silicone loaf tin and I'm wondering if this created too great a depth of cake mixture to cook in the 40mins given in the recipe.  Perhaps I should have used two sandwich tins instead of the loaf pan.  Can anyone advise me?  Has anyone had a similar experience?  I don't want to give up on this recipe as I think it's a good one and my husband loves spice cake!

It was very dry and tasted like plaster.  I am a frequent baker and followed the recipe exactly.  I  was very disapointed in the end product.

I creamed the butter and sugar together then mixed in 1/3 of dry, sifted ingredients with 1/2 wet ingredients, then 1/3 dry, 1/2 wet and 1/3 dry - worked perfectly! I picked that tip from Anna Olsen tv show 'Sugar' on Food Network. Delicious cake, will definitely make again!

This is the best spice cake that I have every tried. I did use the other suggestions and used 1/2 cup applesauce. I creamed the applesause, the butter and the sugar all together then sifted all the dry ingredients together. I used the suggestion to add the eggs to the milk and then added the dry to the creamed mixture alternating with the milk mixture. Very easy! The cake was moist and flavorful. I served it with fresh whipped cream and it was a hit!

Amazing! I love spice cake and this was great! Instead of 1 cup of butter, I used one stick (1/2 cup) and 1/2 of applesauce. I don't like ginger so I did not include it.

This is the first time I've baked a cake from scratch... so I'm probably easily impressed by how well this came out ;)  I did find the cake to be a bit dry, but not too much so - however, I did make a change by using 2 9-inch round cake pans instead of 1 9x13 inch pan as directed.  Tried to adjust my baking time a little bit, but probably was just a bit off in doing so.  Everything else was fantastic - spices, amounts, the ability of the cake to stand up to my novice handling for the 2-layer assembly, and even the method of combining the ingredients was clear enough for me to follow.  I would definitely recommend an electric mixer for that part - and while it may just be inexperience, I'd call the stage before the brown sugar addition more 'granular' than 'pebble-like', as I never saw anything that looked like well-structured little stones.   Batter consistency was thick but pourable in a 75-F degree kitchen.  I frosted & assembled a 2-layer cake using "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site, which took a little work to get reasonably even on the sides, but came out fine & tasted fanastic :D   Will make again!! - maybe using a more 'standard' ingredient mixing approach as discussed elsewhere in the reviews for this recipe.

I had an hour and a half to bake a wedding cake, and I was out of white flour, brown sugar, butter an milk.  I used mochi flour and spelt, white sugar and molasses,  ghee and coconut oil, and hazelnut milk. The result was a fluffy yummy moist gingery cake. I made an icing of walnut-butter, hazelnut milk and powdered sugar so I could stick coconut flakes to the top and make it look wedding-ish.   It was so beautiful and delicious that the bride and groom asked me to make it again when they throw a reception party (hopefully with more than a couple hours notice).  Long story short: here's a basic cake that can stand up to a lot of fooling around and still save the day.

I tried this cake for a friend's birthday and I was disappointed that it was so dry!  I was hoping it would be moist as the title suggested.  I did refrigerate it overnight, so perhaps it was my fault.  Thankfully, I added a cream cheese based frosting which was the saving grace.  I would not recommend this recipe.

Really great tasting, but it was SOOO crumbly (Not neccesarily in a good way :(
But it tasted so good, it still deserves 4 stars *LoL* I used 4 or 5 tsps of Pumpkin Pie spice instead of all the individual spices. Yum! :)

This spice cake is delicious & moist! Yeah the method is unconventional so I ignored it & used the traditional cake method. But that's no reason to down rate the recipe, especially if you know ahead of time that you're just going to make it your way & not the way that's stated. I can't speak for others, but when I search for a recipe it is because I wish to find a combination of ingredients & the amount of those ingredients so I can make something that tastes good. I made this as listed for a 2 layer birthday cake for someone who requested a spice cake, as it is her favorite. She loved it so I was happy. Plus, I loved it too when I had a piece. The only thing I would do different next time is use less ginger but that's b/c I'm not crazy about ginger. And next time is tomorrow when I make this for a birthday cake for my sister.

Five star recipe, excellent cake and I took Samantha Li's advice as creaming the butter and sugar then adding the eggs with milk and then I folded the dry ingredients. I also used the advice of adding 1/2 cup of apple sauce, excellent I do that to a lot of my cakes and I used Margarine instead of butter. Was a great cake, one of the best, better than store bought and really is simple too.

DELICIOUS! This cake recipe definitely deserves the 5 stars. It came out perfectly and has gotten rave reviews at my house. It was not too difficult to make, though be careful if using a hand mixer. The batter was so thick  at one point that I had almost all of the batter wrapped around the mixer. But once all of the liquids were added in, the batter became very light and fluffy. It is great as is, but if you like spice, I think this could stand to have a bit more added. Goes very well with cream cheese frosting.

I'm not sure how I feel about this recipe. I like it, but I don't think I would call it a cake, it's much too dense. It's more like a muffin or loaf recipe. The spices are alright. I prefer more of a kick in my stuff so perhaps I might use  some candied ginger or cracked black pepper next time I make it. It definitely needs something inside or on top of it. Although my family loved this, we all agreed that it was lacking. 

I feel like  diced plums, dates, or raisins and nuts could work well in this recipe, maybe even slices of apple. Or some kind of glaze on top. I might try adding a little applesauce to moisten it up next time, too.  Overall, I think it could be a good recipe to adapt for other uses, just not a cake.

This turned out to be one of the worst cakes I've ever made. It was too easy to over-beat the batter, which caused it to not rise. And adding in the brown sugar last led to pockets where the sugar stuck together and created brown sugar craters. I wasn't crazy about the flavor, either.

This was a GREAT recipe!  After reading the ingredients (especially noting the amount of cornstarch) and a few of the reviews complaining that this was a dry cake I added an extra 1/4 - 1/3C of milk. I made cupcakes, I baked them for 21 minutes and they were SO GOOD! I filled them with caramel and topped them with cream cheese frosting and a little bit of brown sugar. everyone went nuts for these - i will definitely make them again.

The flavor is perfect, but the consistency is not.  My cake broke into pieces when trying to remove it from the greased and floured pan - it stuck to the bottom anyway.  I tried to slice it out of the pan and got some slices but mostly crumbles.  Don't know how I'm going to frost it...

The taste of this cake is lovely (I used cream cheese frosting), and I will definitely be trying it again.  However, it came out slightly dry for me, even though I followed the directions to a T (unless it was because I used unbleached flour)  I've never made a spice cake before, so I was a little worried when the batter was extremely thick and sticky - not sure if that's normal or if I did something wrong.  Also, the cake is pretty thick, so next time I will split the batter into 2 pans.  That way, I can share it with more people!

Made exactly to the recipe, except for a tiny mistake. Stop mixing when the mix looks like tiny pebbles, I kept beating until it turned into a thick paste. I think this may have compromised my moistness and texture. But it was still good andnext time I might add some more spices. I frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting I, which is delicious but a bit runny.

I made a mistake and didn't read this recipe right. I ended up creaming the butter and sugar together, and then alternating the milk mixture and the dry mixture while mixing with my hand mixer. The batter was so light and fluffy. It's in the oven now but I know it's going to turn out great!! I made this in oder to make a pumpkin trifle later in the week. I can't wait to see how it comes out!

This was a great spice cake recipe! I made it for my father for fathers day, & also made a cream cheese frosting to drizzle over it. I used a bundt cake pan, & baked it on 350 for about 55 minutes, until the toothpick came out clean.  It baked beautifully. Everyone loved it. Next time, I will add an extra half a cup of sugar, to make it sweeter.  Excellent recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor is wonderful.  Unfortunately the cake is not moist and if tender means it crumbles and falls apart when you cut it then it is very tender =(  Sorry to say but I am still on the search for a great spice cake recipe.

I really love this recipe- the texture is very much like a coffee cake if you follow the instructions about mixing exactly. Delicious with caramel frosting, but the cake is so delicious, I think I'll try it just sprinkled with powdered sugar next time. My friend loved it and requested it again!

My daughter likes cake only -- no icing -- so that presents a challenge.  This cake was so so good.  We gave it to our neighbors and their two young boys even raved about it and we loved it, too.

Spice cake is one of my favorite American cakes, and having lived in England for the past year and a half, I really appreciate being able to make a cake that really brings me back home. I made this particular cake for my British in-laws at Thanksgiving last year. It was a huge hit with my husband's family, so a few weeks ago I made it again in cupcake form for my co-workers. It is so warm and moist, and British buttercream icing really complements it well. The cupcakes kept for over a week, and they weren't even tightly covered--just a bit of foil draped over them! This recipe has turned out beautifully every time I've made it. This is a permanent addition to my recipe collection!

My family's favorite cake. Top with homemade butter cream frosting and cut small pieces - it's very rich. We omit the cloves (we don't like them) to no ill effect.

There is actually a reason for adding the ingredients in the order written. Adding the butter to the flour creates a tender, velvety crumb. It's a two-stage method used to create less gluten and thus a more tender, albeit denser, cake. If you are not following the instructions in the recipe, you are cheating yourself of all this cake can be. Remember that baking is chemistry, and you will get different results with different methods.

Best cake I've baked in a very long time! I will keep it handy. I agree with other comments: cream the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla; add dry ingredients alternatively with milk. Also check for doneness after 30-35 min. We topped ours with a warm vanilla sauce over warm cake.. YUM!!!

Hmmm. I wanted to love this. Despite other reviews I made it exactly as written just to see. It was ok. Decent flavor, but I was really craving a moist texture. As written, this was more like a dry muffin than a moist cake. Not bad, but I'll keep looking.

Yummy flavor, def. opportunities to increase the spice flavor. I did add a little extra of all spices. Moist cake, cooking time is right on. I made cream cheese frosting and it was a perfect compliment.

Anything but moist
The combination of spices in this cake was good but nut not up to the level needed for pronounced spice flavors and aromas. When making a 'spice' cake, we don't want to think timid. We want bold flavors.
So this recipe fell short in the flavor category. 
Secondly, although we followed the recipe to the letter, the cake did not come out moist. If we were to try this again, we would replace the butter with vegetable oil to try improving the inherent moisture level. 
As one other reviewed pointed out, the method for combining the ingredients was contrary to most traditional 'cream the butter and sugar' as the foundation for mixing additional ingredients. Not sure if the mixing method the author proposed contributed to the lack of moisture or if that is attributed to using butter as the only fat in the cake.

This recipe needed a lot of alteration to make it work. Chiefly, it was far too dry as batter.  I added 2/3 cup of sour cream for moisture retention and an extra half cup of half-and-half cream (totaling 1.5 cups half and half, instead of milk).  I baked it at 325F instead of 350 and lined my baking tins fully (sides and bottom) with parchment/greaseproof paper.   If you are baking this in one pan, 350 is far too hot unless you cover it for most of the baking time. It will catch the edges far before the middle bakes through.   If you are using two 9" pans, it seems to work better, but still, 325 was safer rather than 350.  The sides were well baked before the center was, even at a lower temperature.    3 tsp of baking soda was more than enough; it started to taste metallic, so I didn't go up to 4.  

Also, don't wait until the last minute to mix your brown sugar; you need the agitation to remove any clumps of sugar and that will make the flour glutenous (tough and dry) if you wait until the last step. Cream the sugar with the butter until it lightens in color (whiped air into it) so there is air in your batter for a good rise and even bubble pockets. The directions on this recipe are the "biscuit" method of mixing, which yields crumbly baked goods with large air pockets and dense clusters. 

With 50% more liquid and 2/3c sour cream, it was about as moist as a box mix ever is. I can understand why this would have gone crumbly if you followed the directions exactly!

The name of this cake lies ... this was THE most dry cake I have ever eaten. The spice mix was good, but it was so dry that it just crumbled. Aside from the odd way of combining the ingredients, there is way to much flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. If I were to make this again, which I won't I would only use 2 cups of flour, no corn starch and half the amount of baking powder. The batter is stiff and the cake doesn't rise much. I gave an extra star for the spice mixture.

This cake is great! even my picky brother in law liked it! It took a couple of seconds to get used to the strong spices, but after that, it was delicious. next time i might try adding just a little bit less of some spices.

Made cupcakes with this recipe and they were good, although next time I will use less nutmeg. All I could think about was eggnog when eating them.

I agree with Kitchee, this cake's spice blend was perfect!  No one spice overpowered the others, fantastic cake!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, including the mixing directions.  It was a different way to make a cake then I am used to so I would encourage you to read the directions before you start.  Our cake came out moist, flavorful and was a great success! Thank you Pam for giving me a new spice cake go-to recipe!!

I decided to use this recipe after much searching for a decent spice cake recipe with what I had in house.  I followed the recipe as written.  Although the flavors are great, the spices work wonderfully, none too overpowering, my cake was not as moist as I had hoped.  I too had the issue that a few mentioned, the thick dough clogging my mixers.  I used the method described in the  recipe as apposed to the traditional method in the hopes that this would prevent and over mixed cake.  However once all the ingredients were in, it did pour fine.    This one needs some tweaking, I'm thinking the 1/2 c. of applesauce that one mentioned would do the trick.  Till then I'm still on the hunt for that "just right" spice cake recipe.

This recipe was a near disaster for me. For starters, the batter was so thick and dough-like that my mixer stopped working. I couldn't even get the dark brown sugar worked in. I added an extra egg and some more milk than called for because otherwise the dough would've been a rock. Once I added the milk and egg it turned into the consistency of regular cake batter. The cake turned out good, but it could've used just a little more spice flavor. I probably should've added more spice after adding the additional egg and milk. The consistency was also not as moist as I had hoped. I would give the flavor of the cake 3.5/5  (good) but I took away a star for the prep. I followed the directions perfectly, so I"m still not sure what happened.

I made this cake, exactly as written, and had trouble with the batter when mixing.  I recommend adding the wet ingredients a bit sooner/faster - otherwise, the batter is too thick and will clog your mixer.  I also had to cook a little longer - about 45-50 minutes.

Very tasty, traditional style spice cake. It isn't super sweet, so keep that in mind. I made a 4 layer cake with this and cream cheese frosting, and everyone raved about it. I also made cupcakes (made almost 3 dozen) and they were very good as well. The only thing I don't like about this cake is the mixing method... even with my rad kitchen aid, it had lots of flour and brown sugar lumps both times. Next time I will use the creaming method and see how that works out.

Has a good flavor. Too many steps. Why add brown sugar at the end? I tried to minimize the brown sugar lumps before adding, but after the cake was baked, there were small caramel bits inside. Not moist just a regular cake tenderness.

Could have been a bit more moist, but the flavor was definitely there. My daughter made two layers, filled with whole berry cranberry sauce, frosted with a cream cheese icing and topped with toasted coconut.

This cake is amazing. I baked it in a bundt pan & topped it with a maple glaze after it was baked. I also substituted maple extract for vanilla extract in the batter. It was a huge hit with my family. I will definitely keep this as my go to spice cake recipe....

It was good, the taste was very good, but a little dry.  I didn't realise how high it had risen, so cake was thick and should have added more icing.  I'd make it again, but maybe add an extra egg to make it moist?

I made this cake in a rush and ignored the strange assembly instructions. I baked it in a bundt pan and poured a quick lemon glaze on top. Everyone loved it. The lemon was a perfect addition. My only complaint is that it was slightly too fluffy. I'm not sure what caused that, but I'm sure I'll make this cake again anyway.

When, my 90 year old well traveled friend called and left  a message that it’s the best spice cake she’s ever had, my heart swelled. I served it with good quality vanilla ice cream, although the cake can easily stand alone. Has kept well, and I think was better the second day

Due to the reviews who said that the cake was dense, even though many said it was moist, I did some things to make it more moist, such as use the egg yolk only for one egg and added may 1/4 cup sour cream. I also made it gluten-free  and used gluten-free all purpose flour and added 1 tsp of xantham gum. It turned out amazing! My relatives had no idea it was gluten-free! I added a penuche frosting which is how my grandmother used to top this cake.

I have been seeking a homemade spice cake recipe to try to get away from a box mix. I tried this one, cupcake form, and thought it was tasty but a smidge sweet as I top with a homemade cream cheese icing. I will make again, and perhaps reduce the sugar in the mix. I'd like to taste more spice, less sugar.

I've made this twice now and both times I halved the recipe for a smaller cake.  I creamed the butter and sugar together first to make the process easier and the second time around I only added 1 egg + 1 egg yolk for a denser cake. I really do like the flavors in this but I think it needs a little extra "oomph"--I added some ground cardamom and almond slivers the second time I made it and it came out perfect.

Very moist. I followed the instructions but I did add plumped golden raisins for sweetness. Love this one. I baked in a glass dish and kept it in there for refrigerating later.

Very good blend of spices for this cake. I split this recipe in half and used 2 eggs. I baked this at 350 for an hour and it was done perfectly. Since I only made half the recipe, I poured it into a Bundt cake pan. It tore a little when I dropped it out of the pan onto a plate. It was more moist than the other spice cakes I've made from this site. During baking, my house smelled like the holiday season.

The recipe may be good but 40 minutes is not enough time, and my oven is spot om om temperature. When I opened the oven after 40 minutes to test the bake with a toothpick the cake fell. It was far from done in the middle.

This was the method my mother used to make a lot of "one-bowl" cakes. Moist & delicious, lovely with an afternoon cup of coffee or tea. I added 3/4 cup of chopped toasted walnuts.

This cake has an excellent spice flavor, but I thought it was on the dry and crumbly side.  I added a cup of plumped raisins that enhanced the flavor.  I iced it with vanilla buttercream, which helped to make it more moist.

While the flavor of this cake is wonderful, and had a nice delicate crumb, I find it to be quite dry in texture. I baked it 5 minutes less than the time called for, as it tested done. I suspected this cake would be dry while I was preparing it, due to only using butter as a fat in the ingredients. I will make it again, but I will try adding 1/2 cup oil with the butter. I may also try using applesauce to give it more moisture. Otherwise I like the flavor, nice and spicy! Great with maple frosting.

Really good!  Nice and moist, great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I put a thin layer of caramel frosting on top, which was good; but I agree that it would be delicious without frosting too.

I made it just as described and it turned out great.  I wish it were more moist though and I think the addition of raisins would be wonderful.  My only failing was trying to cook it in a bundt pan but it fell apart when taking it out.  I'd definitely make it again.

I made it exactly as directed and it came out dry. Flavor was good but by day 2 it was almost too dry except for icing on it. I will remake and try adding some oil or applesauce to improve.

Pretty good cake!  I never made a spice cake before, and I was pretty pleased how it turned out, especially because I made it with gluten-free flour.  Better the day it's baked than left over, but I would credit the g-f flour for that.

I made this recipe last weekend.  I basically put all the wet ingredients in 1 bowl,  the dry ingredients in a second bowl.  Slowly added the dry to the wet and it turned out beautifully.  Walnuts are an option with this recipe but remember,  spice cake isn't for everyone.  Loved this recipe.  Adding it to my recipe cards.

This cake is so easy to make.  So delish.....the spices are just perfect.  Didn't have any problem adding the brown sugar like some other reviewers had.  I also didn't have dark brown sugar, only light brown sugar on hand.  Now this cake was wonderfully soft and moist when it came out of the oven, couldn't wait to take a small piece of It! ( my friend tasted it and her eyes rolled back in a food-satisfying omg )! I made a homemade cream cheese frosting for it.  Well you have to refridgerate cream cheese frosting.  The cake became "heavy" like.  I do not know why.  You don't really need to frost it, it's good without frosting.  Next time no frosting no fridge.

I made this cake twice in one day--although I used spray Pam on the Bundt pan, the first cake was partly stuck in the pan so that one was for me and my husband.  The second cake came out perfectly.  I followed the directions except I creamed the butter and sugar before adding the wet ingredients and then added everything to the dry ingredients.  Although this cake smelled great while baking, it came out pretty dry even though I baked it for 60 minutes at 350 degrees.  My husband liked it and I will help eat it but it was not the best spice cake I have made and eaten.

I reduced the servings to 4, omitted the cloves and used a whole egg.  I baked it in 2 - 3x5 mini loaf tins for approximately 30-35 minutes.  I creamed the butter & sugar then added the egg & vanilla.  Combined the dry ingredients then alternated adding dry ingredients & milk to the butter/sugar/egg mixture.  To measure my flour I spooned it into my measuring cup then leveled it off.  The cake was very moist!  I didn't think it had a very distinct spice flavor, my husband liked it though.  I used a Brown Butter Brown Sugar Frosting, which pairs really well!

This was my first attempt at a spice cake.  I combined the ingredients the "traditional way" as per other reviewers.  I also added some walnuts and topped it with powdered sugar.  Oh my gosh, it was delicious.  Thank you very much for sharing!

I made this cake twice in one day. First time I followed the recipe exactly except I forget to add the baking powder to the dry ingredients, so I added it to the completed batter. 
After that one finished baking, I made another and this time read the reviews. I followed the standard cake formula this time (cream, then alternate wet and dry) and adjusted the spices a touch (1 1/2 t. ginger, scant 1/2 t. nutmeg, rounded 1/2 t. allspice.) I didn't add the applesauce because it seemed plenty moist. 
Both had the scratch cake texture with a significant crumb, although the second was finer. I never take a 9 x 13 cake out of the pan, so I didn't get the cracking that others did.
I topped both cakes with one recipe of Scrumptious Penuche Frosting (from this site). 
I prefer the standard preparation method. As written was innovative, but like other reviewers, I got pockets of brown sugar. Because that one had already been relegated for home consumption, that didn't bother me much. Both cakes had a slight depression in the center, possibly from checking doneness too early (although at the listed time.) The spice mix of the first cake mellowed overnight, so I am not certain it needed changing.
Tasty cake. I won't get rid of the recipe.

This is a keeper.  I have tried a lot of scratch spice cakes but this is the best.  It's a moist, dense cake and with cream cheese frosting it's delightful.  I only make half a recipe for the two of us, in a 9x9 pan and bake about 30 min.

Cooked it in a round releasable cake tin- when I went to release the cake it split up the middle.

This cake got rave reviews from all of our dinner guests - used the exact recipe amounts as stated but followed a more traditional method for combining them.   I baked for 45 minutes in a bundt pan and it turned out perfectly! A delicious thin crunchy crust and very soft in the middle. Loved the spice combination! I served it dusted with powdered sugar and topped with fresh whipped cream.

This was such a hit at a barbeque picnic I went to a couple of weeks ago. My friends could not stop reacting in ecstasy! LOL! Many said it was the best cake they've ever had. I was extremely impressed as well. I did tweak it a bit; I added a 1/2 cup of applesauce like some commenters did, and used the traditional creaming method for cakes. I also added some cardamom; I have a huge jar of it and need to use it! I also used Earth Balance spread instead of butter(me and a friend have issues with dairy).I frosted it with a maple buttercream, also using Earth Balance and real maple syrup, and sprinkled it with chopped pecans. YUM! In fact a couple of friends demanded I make it for Thanksgiving. 'Oh twist my arm".....

I made this cake as cupcakes and it turned out great! My differences: doubled cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg; did not use ginger or cloves. I used the usual creaming method when mixing. They came out nice and moist and held together really well.

Not so moist.  I made this twice as I thought I must have messed up the first time. Both times the batter was very thick and did not pour into the pan..it was close to cookie dough not cake batter. Tasted good but very dry and crumbly. Maybe the wet to dry ratios.need.adjusting. Thanks

Please add applesauce and make it two eggs instead of three! The original recipe is very DRY!!! The taste is amazing and goes very well with cream cheese frosting.

There is one problem with this cake....its the corn starch....I have no idea what the purpose of corn starch serves...this is why the cake turns out so dry..I omitted the corn starch..I also used 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/2 cup of oil... I used 2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda.. And of course mix all the wet ingredients but not the milk, then the dry ingredients.... alternating adding the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with the milk..with these changes this cake is a 5 star!!!

Smells in my kitchen are amazing.
I used organic in bleached flour
It's taking at least 15 min more to bake
But by the look and smell my family will be raving!

Really good spice cake. I baked it in a bundt pan and drizzled lemon confectioners icing on it for my brother's BD. I also followed my usual cake mixing steps; less complicated and less dishes than the way recommended in the recipe.

I would cut down on the ginger and the nutmeg if I were to make this again.  It was just too strong of a spice flavor for my liking.

I think the flavor and the moistness were quite good, but I did add 3c shredded apples. I made this recipe after studying for several hours- so I was more than a little lazy. I mixed the wet and dry ingredients per instructions, beat in the butter til it was barely mixed, and then dumped in all wet ingredients at once. When that was barely mixed I added all the apples and sugar. noms

This recipe was absolutely perfect the way it was.  I did not try the alterations suggested by other reviewers and so glad that I didn't.  The cake was absolutely perfect the way it was and only needed a dusting of confectioner's sugar to complete it.  The cake reminds me very much of old fashioned ginger cake that we make at Rocky Mount, TN Living History Museum.  Sure, alterations would probably go very well with it, but sometimes simplicity takes the cake.  Punny intended.

Weirdest recipe ever. I knew it didn't seem right to do the steps in the order listed but I followed the recipe to a T. The batter was so thick it made my mixer smoke and I followed the steps adding 1/3 at a time. Anyways the flavor is GREAT. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars, but the cake came out a crumbly mess and was done after only 33 minutes. I won't use this recipe again but I will make note of the spices used. Hoping the frosting holds the cake together enough to eat it!

Very delicious and moist cake. I like the fact that it's plain so you could touch it up if you want. The way of mixing the ingredients is strange but it works and it makes lovely results.

I ended up throwing out the entire cake. I am an intermediate level baker- so I did cream the butter and sugar together with the egg mixture but the cake was so dry, I was not able to get it out of the pan in one piece. The spice combination was quite lovely but the batter mixture is very dense and the final product tastes more like flour than the spices. I used a 9x13- there is way too much batter for just one 9x13.  If I were to make this cake again (which I probably will not) I would reduce the flour by 1/2 cup and use a bundt pan for baking.

I added the applesauce and kept the dry/wet ingredients separate until the end, as recommended in the reviews, and the cake was moist and not crumbly.  HOWEVER, I did expect more of a light and fluffy spice cake, which is not what this is.  The cake must have weighed 5 lbs when it was done!  It is a dense, dense, dense cake, and the heaviness of it takes away from any flavor.  I would not make again.

Yes, the instructions are unusual!  Despite making 100s of cakes in the past, I followed the strange recipe.  Should have just gone with my gut and creamed the wet ingredients and butter and slowly add in the wet.  The taste of the cake was just okay.  It didn't taste very moist.  I cooked the cake in 2 nine inch pans for 29 mins.  I wont make this cake again.

Very tasty spice cake!!!  Instead of 1 cup of butter, I used a low-fat butter spread, and since it has salt in it, I skipped the salt.  I also used egg subsitute instead of egg, and only one cup of brown sugar, and a tiny bit of stevia.  It was delicious.  I shared it with my neighbors and recommend this recipe!!!  Super Yummy!

I had to make it twice because the recipe didn't say to cream the brown sugar with anything and it was all lumpy.  The second time it was dry and hard.  The one positive is the spice combination rocked so I am going to try other recipes and use this spice combination.

I made this cake (using a few tablesppons of applesauce, like others recommended) and when cake was done, and I put it on the cooling rack, it fell apart!  the flavor was good but it was too moist and I was so disappointed that it fell apart.

The taste on this cake is very good, different. It was however very dry and it crumbled and cracked on the cooling rack. I wasn't able to use this for my sons birthday and had to make another cake. The quest is still on for the perfect spice cake!

I'm giving this four stars because of the response it got, and because it was probably amazing straight out of the oven. I used it for a sculpted cake (for a friend who loves "fall flavors") and had to leave it in the fridge overnight so I could make and roll out the fondant. Everyone who tried it raved, but I found it to be a bit dry and too dense for my taste. BUT I'm my own worst critic so I'm sure it was actually pretty tasty.

this cake was so yummy and moist. I drizzled the caramel icing over it: caramel-frosting-i and it was a huge hit at my 11 year old's birthday party.  I used 1 cup wheat flour and the rest all purpose and it was still very moist and yummy. That was the only substitute I made.

The taste is pretty good.  I'll give this more stars if someone knows what time to bake them for cupcakes.  I tried mine at a way lower time, and the cakes ended burnt ( boy was that fun to clean )!

The taste and flavor was excellent.  The only thing that I found difficult was that it was very crumbly and was difficult to cut without falling apart.  If you can fix it, it would be perfect.

I tried this recipe but it came out kinda dry. It has a good flavor but wasn't moist at all. I'll probably try it again but next time I'm going to add a little oil maybe that will help.

I made this for a birthday and was not happy with it at all.  The cake batter was so thick that it burnt out my mixer--it was like pizza dough.  The cake was very dry. The taste was okay, but not enough to make it again.  It definitely needed icing.  TOO DRY.

Let me start by saying that I am not a great Baker, however I made this cake for my kids and they loved it.  My oldest took one to school and all the kids loved it.  I put buttercream icing on it and it was definitely a hit with everyone.....
