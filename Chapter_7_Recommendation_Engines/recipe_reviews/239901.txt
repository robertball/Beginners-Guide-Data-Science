This did NOT go very far with barely any left over. Everyone in my house loves a good tuna noodle casserole and this one fits the bill. We left out the mushrooms due to one child's issue with them and midway into folding in the peas, I stopped when it looked like too much for us, and only added 3/4 of a cup. That was plenty. The one suggestion I might give the next person is, instead of sprinkling the all-purpose flour over the mixture in one of the steps. Reserve a 1/4 cup of the vegetable broth and make a slurry with the 3 TBSPs of flour. The ease of doing that will allow you to avoid clumpy flour bits when the directions tell you to sprinkle it over the mixture. I always tend to have that happen and avoid it as much as possible so that the mixture is smooth. Flour does not sprinkle well at all. Avoiding this will have better results in your dish in the long run. But other then that. I will make this again because it was just flavorful and comforting as a wholesome dish for my family. 10 stars if I could rate it that high.

Eureka! The pickiest seven year old just  ate this dish!  I did make some changes that benefited this casserole. Used 4 oz of cream cheese instead of the recommended 8 oz cube.  I also used 1/2 cup of reduced fat sour cream. I let it bubble for about 8-10 minutes after this step. I didn't used that much shredded cheese, maybe 1/2 cup instead of recommended 1 cup.  My Panko crumbs were rancid, so I used herbed  breadcrumbs , but barely dusted the top.  Cooked 18 minutes and left the casserole in the oven after it was turned off 10 minutes. 
This step made it actually look and taste like casserole. 
It was delicious! Will make again and again.

My search for a wonderful tuna casserole is now over! This was full of flavor! I used No Yolks Dumpling noodles since the store was out of the No Yolks extra wide egg noodles and they worked I think for the better- it didn't come out mushy.
 I did cook the noodles first and set aside even though it was not stated in recipe.  I also stirred the  flour into 1/4 cup of the vegetable broth (room temp is fine) until smooth then added this slurry to the mixture when called for. You should always do this to avoid clumpy lumpy flour! The ingredients for the topping was not specified- for those who would like to know it's the melted butter mixed with the panko bread crumbs :) Also, instead of frozen peas- I used frozen mixed vegetables since that's what I had and I added 3 cans of tuna. Everything else I made as is....DELICIOUS!

Wasn't anything special, pretty bland when I compare it to what my mom used to make us. 1 cup of bread crumbs was WAY TOO much for using just as a topping (as you can see in the photo). My husband said it was a pretty good base recipe, but suggested additives afterward. I totally agree with him.
Also, I used 3 cans of tuna instead of just 2 although this recipe could use 4 if you want to really enjoy the tuna aspect. Perhaps next time I'll sub sour cream for the cream cheese, use 1/3cup bread crumbs, and also to with grated parmesan cheese! Mangiare!

This was great, except I could tell from the recipe that the tuna to noodle ratio wasn't right.  I added 16 oz of wide egg noodles and it was better.  I adore peas and thought the amount was just fine, but my daughter thought there were too many.  Too bad, I am the cook, I get to decide how many peas go into my tuna casserole.  This is plain comfort food, so don't expect a culinary masterpiece.  You should expect a wave of nostalgia, contented family members, happy cats who get the tuna juice, and a full stomach.  Best made and served on a cold winter's evening in New England, but I'll eat it anywhere.  Thank you for posting.

After reading the reviews and noting the comments about it being of stroganoff consistency rather than casserole, I cut down on the amount of broth. I also omitted the mushrooms as husband does not like them. Consistency was creamy yet celery, onions and peas were crisp. Noodles not mushy. Needs a bit of salt & pepper. Overall delicious! A keeper!

We loved this! DH said it was the best tuna casserole he'd ever had. It's so creamy and good. We liked the topping too-- I sprinkled half the cheese then the bread crumbs, then more cheese. DH has requested I make this again soon. :)

Left out the mushrooms mainly because I forgot them when I went shopping.  Also added crushed lays chips vs the bread crumbs.  Turned out amazing.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe as is, except I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and I crunched up some croutons for the topping instead of panko crumbs. These substitutions were made because I did not have the exact ingredients called for in the recipe. This was very quick to prepare and was very good tasting. The ratio of noodles, creamy sauce and tuna were perfect. I was unsure if the noodles should be precooked or not. After reading the recipe and seeing the amount of liquid called for, I decided NOT to precook the noodles, which was the right decision. I will make this again.

I have a little one who is lactose intolerant, so I substituted out the cream cheese with the Kirkland Goat Cheese. I used fresh garlic instead of powder. I added the  garlic with the onions & celery after they were translucent.  I didn't have vegetable broth so I used some organic chicken broth. Also had ran out of panko, so used plain bread crumbs in lieu of and seasoned with salt and pepper. Over all, this is the best recipe I have made when it comes to tuna casserole. I must say, if you like the goat cheese, it adds a great creamy flavor with out the sweetness that cream cheese can add.

Good flavor, but I agree the tuna is not so strong on this one. I liked the creaminess and the crunch on the top. So surprised how well the noodles hold up and keep the shape, and don't get mushy. I really want to only use these noodles for casseroles and soups in the future.

Nice recipe. I thought it was a little bland, however my hubby who dislikes tuna thought it was a good recipe and would like to eat it again. A recipe to repeat with a few additions.

I really liked this recipe for a quick, warm weeknight dinner in the middle of a cold snap.  It was ready in under an hour which was nice.  I did make a few substitutions based on what I had already.  I didn't have quite enough cream cheese so I added in a bit of sour cream.  I also didn't have celery so I left that out and used frozen peas.  I also used canned mushrooms instead of fresh and sprinkled some freshly grated parmesan on top.  This was a bit different than a normal tuna casserole and I agree with another reviewer that it was almost a stroganoff - which was good just not what I was expecting.  I used the No Yolks whole grain noodles and it was great.  I also have leftovers for lunch today so bonus :)  I'll make this again.

This turned out really, really well.  I added two tablespoons of Sriracha to the stove top mixture for a bit of an extra kick.

Overall, it turned out with a taste/texture more similar to a stroganoff than a casserole, but was fantastic!  The pickiest eaters were going back for seconds and the guy who doesn't eat fish took a bowl for himself. Great recipe!  I rated it four stars since it didn't turn out to be much of a casserole, and I would reclassify it.

Next time I make it, I think I'll add one more can of vegetable broth and call it a stroganoff!

Absolutely a keeper! The only substitution I made was to use chicken broth instead of veggie. From the first bite I knew this was not going to last long, even though I tripled the recipe to make sure we had plenty of left overs. I can’t say it enough, I love it!

This recipe was a breeze. Loved making it and devouring it! I divided the casserole mixture into two different casserole dishes and experimented with a no cheese topper. I prefer cheese however it was great without as well.

I’m sorry, this is just bland and boring, and simply tastes weird. Ithought making the sauce would be better, but plain old cream of mushroom soup is much tastier and easier.

I liked that this recipe did not use high sodium canned soup. I tried to buy low sodium vegetable broth but it wasn't available.  It did not specify whether the noodles should be cooked before adding--I have made recipes where the pasta cooks in the liquid.  I added the noodles raw, then allowed the dish to cook longer on top of the stove. I used Splenda flower and made a slurry in a little of the broth before adding.  I aLso cooked the casserole covered for about 15 mins. In the oven. I didnt add cheese for dietary reasons. Husband said it was very good.

Followed the recipe except used chicken broth rather than vegetable and instead of adding flour just added a few more noodles to soak up the extra moisture.

I made exactly to the recipe and I was not a fan, also my two kids wouldn’t eat it either. I wouldn’t make again. I will agree with other reviewers there are too many peas.

I prepared this according to the recipe with the exception of the peas. Rather than measuring, I just added by sight according to my taste.  I found it to be easy to prepare.  It has the classic tuna casserole flavor but better with the fresh vegetables/sauce versus using canned soup.

This is a tasty recipe, I followed the directions as is, with the exception of adding the flour to the mixture. I saved 1/2 cup of the broth and blended my flour with that, then added it to the casserole. I saw comments that thought there were to many peas, but for this size casserole the amount indicated was sufficient. You can fix this ahead of time, then bake when you want. Tip: I used white albacore tuna for a less fisher taste.

This is an excellent recipe!  The only substitution I made was the tuna.  I had a tuna steak and some small salmon pieces in the freezer that I wanted to use in a casserole.  I pan seared the tuna steak and the salmon,  (13 oz.) flaked it, and used it in the casserole.  I also added the flour to the sauteed vegetables before adding the broth.  We loved this casserole and I'll make it again and again.

Very good! The noodles were perfect. I did end up adding a can of cream of mushroom soup to make it a little saucier.

I liked it. Since it's just myself now I was able to adjust what I don't like, I ditched the peas and used corn. I didn't use Mushrooms, instead I used extra celery & onions which gave it so much more flavor!! This was delicious.

Just made this for dinner, and it was amazing. Followed recipe except left out mushrooms because we didn't have any on hand. Also, used canned peas because my daughter hates frozen (she's crazy, right?!? lol). It was a hit with the whole family, and there's plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. Making the sauce from scratch instead of using a can of Cream of Mushroom really made a difference. The Panko bread crumbs were a great idea as well! The only changes I made were in addition to using a real garlic clove towards the end of sauteeing the other veggies, I also tossed in an extra handful of noodles after reading some of the reviews. Great recipe! Will definitely be making again.

I made this recipe on the fly one night, and didn't have all of the ingredients.  I substituted carrots for celery, and chicken stock for vegetable stock, and didn't bother with the cheddar cheese topping.  It was still very good.  The only change I would make is to reduce the amount of the panko topping by about half.

Kinda bland, I would double up on the garlic powder, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce.  Definitely do not need a cup of the bread crumbs. Could probably use another can of tuna.

This was very easy to make and came out nice and creamy. I did not add celery or onion or fresh thyme. I used onion powder and dried thyme. The topping is okay but I think a Ritz cracker and cheese topping would be much better. The peas make this a very pretty dish. It reminded me of a fancy Tuna Helper. My picky eaters did not approve. My husband loved it.

I really enjoyed this dish.  My husband and daughter aren't keen on tuna, so they weren't very excited (but did eat it).  It is a forgiving dish -- I made some adjustments and it still turned out well.  I thought carrots would be nice, so I diced a couple, and threw them in with the onions.  Probably used closer to 1 cup of frozen peas, because that's what I had.  Didn't have vegetable broth, so I substituted reduced sodium chicken broth.  Quite a few people commented that the tuna could be stronger, so instead of two 5 oz cans, I used 2 of the packets (I believe 6.4 oz).  Tasted fine to me, but my husband and daughter would have been happier with less tuna.  Didn't add any salt -- didn't need it.  And from making the No Yolks chicken casserole, I knew that the panko topping would be too much.  I did closer to 1/3-1/2 cup.  Happened to have a partial canister of French fried onions, so I added those on top of the panko toward the end.  I would have been happy with just the French fried onions as a topping.  ~~~*I* would enjoy having this again.  It tasted like comfort food to me.  My husband and daughter would be fine if I never fixed it again.  :-(   Maybe I'll fix this when I go visit my folks . . .

I was just sorta using up some ingredients on hand, and decided to make tuna noodle casserole. My husband "mmmm"-ed the whole time he was eating, and my (picky) brother also commented on how good it was. This will be the recipe I use from now on!
PS several yrs later: Now that my husband is on a sodium restricted diet, glad to have this recipe that doesn't use canned soup!! Yummy!
