This was great. I used dill relish instead of sweet. And I doubled the amount of horseradish because everyone in our family loves it. I will definitely make this again.

Didn't like this as much with the pickle relish.  Second time I made it I used 1/4 cup of minced fresh parsley and rolled the ball in a mixture of additional minced parsley and chopped pecans...We liked it a lot

Nice change from the usual cheese balls.
Tastes great on all cracker varieties.

I made about 2-3 servings from leftover canned corned beef, just eyeballing the amounts of cheese, etc. It turned out surprisingly well, served with fresh French bread.

Loved this! I did use dill relish (hate sweet) and if you use dill, leave out the lemon juice. I didn't think about that until after it was too late. Other than that, this recipe was perfect!
