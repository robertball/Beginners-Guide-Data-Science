Now I have never made bread with yeast before so there could have been some operator error - but there was definitely not enough dough for 2 loaves.  It's a one loaf recipe.  I was a little concerned when the recipe said "pour" into pans and I had a big ol' lump of dough - "pouring" was not an option.  So don't fret!  Just scrape it on in the pan - it tasted just fine.

Just okay for bran bread. Very thick and heavy. The dough is definetly not stirrable or pourable, and as a previous reviewer said, it only makes one loaf. It is okay, though I wish I had a better recipe.

I should have trusted my instincts and skipped this recipe.  The amount of liquid to flour / bran is way off.  Even using less flour and more water it could not be salvaged.
