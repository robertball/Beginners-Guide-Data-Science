This was spectacular. I didn't make any changes. But when it came time to serve dinner, I did take the rendered fat and use that. I poured some into the rice to flavor it, and the remaining portion went into my cast iron skillet, where I sauteed carrots, celery, Brussels sprouts, firm tofu, green onions, mushrooms, and cashews - all seasoned with the same spices, plus soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I served them all together and we absolutely loved it!

I have made this a number of times now for my husband and he loves it. I make the recipe as stated with no changes. When I made it today, I drained the grease when I dropped the temperature down to 350°, which made the meat less fatty. My husband preferred it that way.

Two thumbs up! I used all the spices in the recipe and did not make any substitutions to cook my 5 lbs Duroc Pork belly from Fareway Meat Market. I had to adjust the cook time though, adding an extra 30 mins at 350°F since my pork belly’s fat still wasn’t brown and crispy after the one hour mark. Final result was tender and juicy, with melt in your mouth fat. I did use a roasting pan with a rack rather than a baking sheet and parchment paper since I didn’t want my pork belly to sit in rendered fat. Will be making this again!

Excellent recipe and very simple. I purchased a large package of pork belly from Costco, froze it in 3-4 lb sections and have been using this recipe every other month or so.

Excellent! Love the spice rub. I only cooked the meat for a half hour on 350 because it looked very done. Came out perfect.

Was very good -- didn't marinate overnight, but didn't need to.  Will make again!

No changes, just calibrated my oven and, oh, scrumptious! I'll have to see how it reheats but I can see myself making this over and over!  Tender and parts just crispy right!  Thank you for this new addition to my list of family meals!!

These cook times are way off. Outside came out blackened burnt and inside was still very pink.
