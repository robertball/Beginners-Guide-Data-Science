I made this for my family and, surprisingly, they all enjoyed it. I made a few changes though...I sauteed the leeks and onions in 1/2 a stick of butter. In a separate pot, I added an egg with the chicken stock and heated until thickened. Then I added the leeks & onions to it. I cut up the ham slices and layered it along with the cubed chicken and the leek mixture. Instead of using pie crust, I used puff pastry and just laid it across the top of the casserole. I turned the heat up to 375 degrees F. Next time I think I'll try making this in a 9x13 and covering the entire top with puff pastry so that each serving has its own little piece of puff!

I am a food service director at a retirement facility & we made this recipe for our Men's Luncheon today.  We did tighten the filling up as some readers suggested.  We baked this as individual pies and used puff pastry to top them instead of pie crust.  All 26 men loved this dish & have requested that we have it again.  Someone suggested using egg in the sauce to tighten it & I would like to try that as I think it would also add some additional richness.  Good flavors & an interesting mix w/ the chicken & ham.

I haven't tried this yet but plan to. I will, however, lightly saute the onions and leeks in 2 tbsps of butter or marg and add 2 tbsps of flour. Let the flour cook for a couple minutes and then add the stock. This should help with the soupiness others have mentioned.

I can't rate this recipe because I haven't made it yet.  But I do see why the other reviewers are saying it was runny.  This is basically a quiche recipe without the eggs or cheese.  There's too much chicken stock so the heavy cream doesn't have a chance to thicken or set. My suggestion would be to cut down on the chicken stock a bit and add an egg to the cream and stock mixture.

I made this recipe without reading any reviews.  The flavor was wonderful, but it definately needs thickening, I plan to decrease the broth and mix it with a roux next time I make it.  Making the recipe the way it is posted, you end up wasting all the cream as it just runs off.  I expect I will give it 5 stars when after trying again modified.

Yes, three stars sums it up.  I think something has been left out of this recipe.  When you pour the cream in, it just makes the insides float.  However, the taste is very good.  I thought it was very savoury.  However, I wouldn't make it again unless I figured out how to make it thicker.  I guess adding cornstarch at some point would help.

It was pretty good.  My husband went back for seconds, which is a good sign.  I would however, cut back on the number of leeks, and lengthen the cooking time by about 5 to 10 minutes.  It was rather soupy, so I might cut back on the the heavy cream by half as well.  The flavor was good, but four leeks way over-powered the taste of the dish.  I will try it again, but with the tweaks I suggested.  Erin go bragh.

I think this recipe has great potential.  Wish I had read the reviews first -- but instead I made it for a company potluck on St. Paddy's Day without reading them.  My Mistake.  The other reviewers have it right!  I made a roux with the liquids I poured off and served it as a sauce over the remainder and it was quite good.  I made it in an Oval stoneware dish and there was way way more than 6 servings with the ingredients it called for.  I had leftovers that just wouldn't fit.  Could easily do two pie pans.  I like the whole shredded chicken approach mixing dark and light meat for flavors.  I would definitely cut back to 2 leeks medium size and don't cut into the green at all.  Sauteing in a little butter before hand with the onion also (cut back on that a bit too...) would render the whole pie a bit easier to fit in the dishes.  Adding some other veg - peas/carrots even a pt of potato might work to help thicken the liquids.  Someone mentioned flouring the chicken first - Depending on your chicken prep that would be good too.  I think a Tbs or two dusted over would be enough to skip a prepared roux.  You'll have butter from the sautee-ing but definitely cut back on the liquids.  I'd say 1/2c of chicken broth and 1/2 c cream - added up front not after baking might do it - and then prepare a sauce with remaining liquids with a roux... just in case!  Also the puff pastry sounds like a nice alternative.  But even a pre-made crust will do.  I just prefer making my own.  Good Luck

I make this often with different variations depending what's in the pantry and EVERY time it's a winner. A tin of sweet corn (reduce the stock) works - etc. FAMILY FAVORITE

Flavors were pretty good, but came out VERY runny.  Maybe I did something wrong...but probably won't make again.

Pretty good, not great. I used leftover cooked chicken, added peas, and cooked it up in a 9" pie dish. I agree with the first reviewer, it was very soupy; perhaps more slits in the crust would allow some liquid to evaporate. I'll probably keep trying other chicken pie recipes. Thanks anyway.

I used leeks, onion, left-over roast chicken and stock.  Served with buttered Brussels sprouts and black pepper. No cream. Delicious!

I cooked this pie for my annual Friday night pie night for some boys and they loved it. I made a few tweaks and added lardons instead of sliced ham and I added everything to the chicken pot before putting it in the pie but the sauce, cant fault it. Delicious.

It came out awesome!  i made a few changes, i cut up chicken breast instead of using a whole chicken and substituted turkey for the ham and also added an egg to the chicken stock to not make it soupy.  i also followed the recipe for 6 people but separated it into two pie pans.

This is a recipe very similar to something my mom, born and raised in Ireland made for us growing up.  We just call it Irish Pot Pie, lol.  One thing we do is to coat the peices of chicken in flour with salt and pepper, which does help thicken up the sauce as it cooks.  If it is still too runny, we just make up a bit of flour/water to thicken it a bit more.  I also add some baby carrots, which makes it prettier.  We also use pastry sheets, which we cook separately so it raises better..and put it on top after its all cooked.  It does come out very well.  I love this dish..one of my faves:)

Hi.  I have not made this, but I am looking forward to it. (It'd be nice to be able to leave a comment without rating...) Here's a helpful hint to combat the runniness and keep the rich flavor:  Try adding a half cup of finely ground almonds, as in the Medieval Chicken Pie recipe.  The Irish Chicken and Leek Pie calls for more liquid than the Medieval pie, but the Medieval pie is almost solid-through after baking.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover ham and tried this one out. Although my family liked it, it was very runny. Next time I make it I will be sure to serve rolls to "sop" up the juices.

5 stars because all 5 of us finished with clean plates! Followed other commenters and cooked onion, leek and also carrots in about 2T butter, added about 2T flour and cooked for a couple minutes then added chicken broth. I used rotisserie chicken not realizing I was supposed to use uncooked. But it tasted great! Also used puff pastry. I need to roll it out next time to fit the 13x9 dish I used. Added the warmed cream around the edges after cooking and let sit for a few minutes. It was a little runny, but not bad at all. Will make again.

I took the review's suggestion and tried using egg to thicken but that did not work. Next time I will use flour. I did cook the chicken, onion and leeks first. I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the chicken. I cooked it at 375 for 45 mins. I also did not have ham. I think I also will use the puff pastry next time. The kids still loved it so I will double it.

The proportions just really seem to be off and the lack of a thickening agent is something everybody seems to be fixing.  I've made it twice---once according to the recipe and the second with some corrections.  The recipe just needs work.  I'll keep looking for a chicken leek pie, but this isn't staying in my recipe box.  Sorry
