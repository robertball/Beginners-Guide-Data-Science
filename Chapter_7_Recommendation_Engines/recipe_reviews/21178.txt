You have to add milk last... never boil any cream in a soup like this.  That is why it has curdled on some people.  After everything has cooked down...onions, spinach, spices then add milk and stir in off heat.  Not sure how it keeps in fridge for a month with the milk as an ingredient.

This soup was fantastic! I loved it. I used a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach and used the mandoline to finely chop the onion. 
Next time I will use a little less sugar, it was a little sweet. But superb! 
I also baked a refrigerated pizza crust and melted 1 cup mozz cheese on top and sliced into "dippers." PERFECT!

Wonderful soup!  Definitely saute the onions until soft and puree the soup before adding the chopped spinach.  Also note that the fresh spinach takes longer than stated to properly wilt.  

Our entire family (even the finicky 11 year old) loved it!

Great flavor, not so hot in the looks department--this was mostly my fault, just letting others know what not to do! I didn't have tomato puree, just petite diced; I was going to puree it myself in the food processor, but decided since the onions were in big chunks and I like chunky tomato soup, I would try it as is. So I dumped in the big can of diced tomatoes, and then noticed that the milk was a little curdled. I followed the recipe exactly, so this was a little disappointing. After adding the spinach and basil with the curdled milk it looked really nasty, and I got the bright idea to throw it all in the blender. It came out looking like baby poo :) I had friends over, and they all said the flavor was great, I just don't recommend blending the soup all together. Next time I will just deal with the milk chunks :) Wonderful flavor so thanks for the recipe, I'm going to keep trying on this one! Update: Made again, per recipe except I added the milk last. Still had tiny milk chunks but not bad. Still tasty :)

This is a really delicious recipe!  Per other reviewers suggestions, I diced the onions finely and sauteed them for a few more minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out sooo yummy.  I topped each bowl with freshly grated parmesan and served it with toasted sourdough bread.

I've never had homemade tomato soup, but I'd have to say, this was excellent, though I made some modifications.  I used a 12oz can of tomatoe paste, oregano instead of basil (because I was out) and I added a cup of chicken broth to thin it out a bit. It turned out fabulous!

This IS a very versatile recipe. I simmered the onion  and garlic in water, left out the sugar and replaced the milk with rice milk and my family (which includes 5 kids) still loved it.  Even my picky son who was so upset that I put spinach in his tomatoe soup.  I did ladle out about half the soup into a blender to puree.  It gave it a smoother texture overall.  We served it w/ croutons on top and it was delish' !

Great soup and very easy.  As recommended, I finely chopped the onions using my food processor.  When sautéing the onions and garlic I added red pepper flakes to add a bit of a kick.  Also, when I added the last ingredients I added about a cup of chicken broth to thin it out a bit.  Will make it again.

This recipie wasn't as quick as the directions stated, but still didn't take a long time to cook.  The recipie was a hit....except next time I will chop the onion into smaller pieces or cook them longer,  they ended up as chunks in the soup.  Overall a good spin on tomato soup.

I loved this soup.  The onions could have been cooked a little bit longer, but overall, an excellent quick and easy recipe.

Wow amazing, i made this last night, enough for eight people and Ive frozen it in individual portions, this will be really useful after a long day at work and i want something quick and easy for the evening meal. Mine also curdled a bit, my fault for not following earlier advice on this site. But by the time i stick blended it, it was fine. Not the same colour as the pic but this could be due to the spinach and blending it all together. Not that any of that matters, lovely healthy soup.x

Probably one of the best soups I've ever made.  I went heavy handed on the garlic, basil and spinach - it was the right choice.  This is delicious served with crustini and melted fresh mozzarella. I do not feel it is necessary to puree anything - I like it sort of rustic and chunky.  Also, I've only had this NOT separate a bit on me once.  It doesn't seem to make a difference if you add the milk and then bring to a boil, or wait and add the milk after the heat is off.  Either way, it doesn't change the flavor, it just doesn't look quite as pretty.  AWESOME RECIPE!

Wonderful soup! I cooked the onion and garlic for about 10 minutes, until very soft. I also used a stick hand blender and blended the soup prior to adding the spinach and basil to make it very smooth and creamy. It turned out wonderful. I paired it with garlic parmesan french bread. I will definitely make this again!

This soup is delicious. I substituted almond milk(dairy allergy) and added a little crushed peppers for a little heat and eliminated the sugar(the almond milk added a little sweetness) Thanks for a yummy recipe.

I agree with the comment about not adding dairy before the soup is boiled.

Using a canned tomato product with such short cooking times results in a soup that tastes very flat and as if it were a poor-quality commercial soup.  Something containing spinach, onions, garlic, and tomato should taste much better than this does.

Awesome and easy.  I actually cut the milk back to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to butter/garlic/onion and let it cook down a bit.  VERY tasty!

Yum, this was good! I halved the recipe, used a red onion, a 14 oz can of Italian flavored Diced tomatoes and way more garlic. I left out the sugar. Easy, peasy lunch that was tasty!

I used a package of frozen spinach, dried basil, and a can of crushed tomato since I didn't know when I would get to make it and I didn't want the ingredients to go bad before I did, and it was so good!  I'm sure it would be amazing if all fresh ingredients were used!

This soup is great with or without the spinach. Just don't leave out the "Fresh Basil" I also minced the onions, and pureed the soup before adding the spinach.  I will be making this recipe over and over. You don't need all that heavy cream to make a delicious soup, and this recipe proves it!

I  scaled by half and used  (3) fresh tomatoes so I added about 1 T of  double tomato paste. I used up 1/4 cup whipping cream for part of the milk, won't be doing that again.  Might even sub the milk for some veggie broth next time.

I really liked this soup, except it was a little too thick. Adding a cup of chicken broth took care of that. The fresh basil is of major importance, as is fresh spinach. Next time, I will use only half the sugar and I'll add some grated Swiss cheese, as one of my  favorite restaurants does. My hubby needed to add some hot pepper flakes. I'm making this for company next week.

Overall a good soup! Like other reviewers I had issues with the onion, which is odd for me because I usually love it in any form. The flavor of the diced onion in this recipe is strong and the texture was a bit odd. I ended up running the whole soup through the blender to really mince the onion well, that helped a lot. This soup is quick, easy, healthy and flavorful. I will definitely make again.

made a great soup.  I tweaked it a little by processing the completed soup to make it a little smoother and I added a little more milk to help make it more soup like than stew.  I love the flavor of the spinach and the basil.

A very healthy soup that just needs a bit more of a bite to satisfy the taste buds of my family.  I took my hand bender to the soup before adding the spinach to give it a smoother texture.

This soup is super easy and seriously amazing. I made it two days ago and today am making another batch, this time doubling the recipe...that good!

I read some reviews and decided to add a cup of chicken stock to thin it out. Also if you buy crushed tomatoes with basil already in it, saves you from having to buy the real stuff. SO SO GOOD! 5 STARS!

This soup is fantastic!  I have made it many times, including for some of my friends who are VERY good cooks, and they all asked for the recipe.  I always double it and add extra spinach.  Then I use a hand blender to puree as much as possible.  I added a cup of whipping cream this last time (to a triple batch), and it was ohhh so yummy.  I usually don't add any extra fat, except for the milk, and it is a healthy, delicious soup!  Never had trouble with curdling milk.

I made this soup, in a vegan version, by substituting vegan friendly ingredients, and I am utterly addicted. This freezes well too so I have weeks wirth of hot creamy soup available. Thank you!

I pretty much made this soup exactly to the directions.  I doubled the recipe to make more.  Only thing I did different was when I doubled it, I used one can of tomato puree and 1 can of crushed tomatos.  I like my soup hearty.  However, I did not double the milk when I doubled the serving.  I did what other reviews said and added the milk AFTER it was done.  This is the best tomato soup ever!

Delicious! Tastes like something you could get at Sweet Tomatoes! I warmed up my milk in the mocrowave and then added it at the end so it wouldn't curdle or burn. Excellent recipe! I'm keeping this one for sure!

This was really good.  I've tried making homemade tomato soup recently and didn't like the other recipes.  This one is easy and tastes great with a nice texture.  The fresh basil is a nice touch.

Yummy! I made the soup using fresh tomato sauce I had made from our garden (which had bits of carrots and celery in it already). I sauteed the onions and garlic (I doubled the garlic) and then pureed the whole thing as smoothly as I could get it. I didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen spinach (drained really well). I made a white pizza with a little of the leftover spinach and used the soup as a dipper. It was absolutely fantastic! This is a keeper!

This recipe took me by surprise.  I have been cooking for over 60 years and I made this and coudn't stop eating it. It was wonderful. A suggestion for others is to use a  hand blender toget reid of the chunks of onion, but I liked the chuncks.   The hand blender is easy to use and does a good job

delicious! i liked that it was still a nice hearty soup! i made the tomato puree from scratch (mostly just peeled, seeded and blended up 6-7 tomatoes) and added more garlic ( a small bulb of local garlic). the garlic was not too overpowering it was sweet and tasty. also i added 1 teapoon of sugar instead of a tablespoon. added a mixture of fresh and dried basil since basil isn't really in season right now. i served with a french baguette my boyfriend and i loved it :)   nice hearty soup

Delicious.  However, as other users noted, it was missing a little 'kick.' I added some Frank's Hot Sauce and that did the trick!  Took this soup from a 4 star to a 5!!!

this soup was delicious.  It was my first time making a spinach soup and it turned out great!!!  I will make it again for sure!!  I used tomato sauce and Heavy Whipping Cream instead and dried basil leaves from the bottle.  It was really good!!  Served with garlic butter mini toasts!!

I loved this tomato soup. I didn't have tomato puree on hand but I had 5 fresh medium to small sized tomatoes on the vine. I deseeded and peeled the tomatoes and added it to the onion, garlic, carrot and celery which were coarsely chopped and sauteed. The tomatoes boiled down. Once they were cooked, I put it in a blender and pureed it all! I then poured it all back into the pot and added the milk. After the milk was stirred in, I reheated it one last time. I had no problems with clumping or curdling. 
It was so yummy.. and the best part of it was that I was guilt free. Since I used fresh tomatoes, the soup was fresh and healthy. I added the spinach and basil right at the end before serving with some cheesy wheat toast. Yum!

This was very good.  The kids didn't even figure out that was spinach in there and they all loved it!  I just preempted the question by telling them it was packed with basil, which was no lie.  I served with grilled cheese.  I doubled the recipe and used a 10 ounce pack of frozen chopped spinach which I thawed but did not drain.  The soup was pretty thick, so I thinned it out a bit with water.  Don't skip the grated parmesan topping.

Excellent soup!  I keep diced tomatoes on hand so simply browned onion, garlic, added tomatoes and pureed w/immersion blender.  I didn't have fresh spnach on hand so used chopped frozen, used more pepper and cheese but that was it.  I added the milk at the end and heated thoroughly.

Very good recipe.  Wife and I would only change one thing, and that would be to cut back on the onion (about half), and cook them longer before adding the other ingredients.  I'm a soup lover, and this is something we will make more often!  Easy too!

This recipe reminds me of a recipe I used to make for my children. I would saute celery and carrots with the onions, add the tomato and then pureed all of this until smooth. I love this new recipe because it has spinach! I used frozen spinach that I thawed and pressed the water out of. I added cayenne and less sugar as well as chicken stock instead of milk. I served with bacon, cheddar cheese and parmesan cheese for anyone who wanted those added. Very good!

Very good taste and couldn't be easier! I followed advice of another reviewer and added the milk at the end. Then I put it in the blender to make it look more appealing. Served it with a warm crusty sourdough baguette -- delicious!

I was dissappointed in this soup as I LOVE good tomato basil soup.  But it was like eating spaghetti sauce straight??? I think it was missing something.  I even tried adding a little sherry but still not right?  It may need CREAM???

Great recipe! I didn't have tom puree, so I used crushed toms and half a can of tom paste. Did onions, added toms, then pureed all of it, put in put and added basil, spinach, milk and 1/2 c of water. Turned out wonderful. Great recipe to build on!

This soup is good.  It’s snowing here today and my kids enjoyed this with a grilled cheese sandwich after playing outside.  They don’t care for spinach but they had no problem eating it in this soup.

I added lots more garlic and spinach than the recipe called for.  I also added chicken broth and some half and half so it was much creamier.  It was especially good topped with Parmesan cheese.

I'm a complete beginner and this soup turned out really well.  I followed the directions (for the most part) but I'm thinking about added the milk at the end next time as some of the reviewers recommended because I did have a bit of curdling.

This was a great base recipe to work off of. I went heavy on the Spinach (to up the nutrition for my 3 kids 3yrs and under), doubled/tripled the garlic, used Italian Seas since I didn't have fresh basil, browned the onions in butter then added garlic, added 1/2 cup Chicken Broth and 1/2 cup parmesan (we love cheese here!), and then crushed red pepper for my husband and I. I used the immersion blender before adding the Spinach since my kids can't eat chunky soup (or drink as it is through their straws!). Served it with seasoned croutons on top and grilled cheese to dip. Yummy! Thanks for the idea!

I followed the recipe and this tastes like warm tomato puree.  It was very thick.  I thinned it with a cup of chicken broth.  Perhaps will be be better today?  Not a winner in my book...

Really good.  I don't do dairy so I used Rice Milk, didn't include the sugar (don't like sweet soups).  I also used tomato paste because that was all I had.  I did have to add Organic Free Range chicken broth because it was so thick, probably about a cup, or so.  I blended before the spinach and spices, and added croutons (but don't need them). I'm thinking of using 1/2 an onion and a little more garlic next time.  It was really good and a great winter soup.

Just made this and it was very nice. Made as noted except without spinach as I did not have any handy. I did not have puree in the pantry so I used a 29 oz can of Hunt's Organic tomato sauce. I also used FF milk and did not find the sauce think at all. I served with a sprinkle of parm and homemade sundried tomato rosmary bread.

This is a pretty good base soup.  But I had to add plenty of extra seasoning to get the flavor I was looking for.  I decided to add italian sausage to give it more substance and that improved it.

I have never given a bad review before, but unfortunately the time has come.  After i completed the recipe i tasted it, and it was so bland and overpowered by the tomato puree that i had to add another tablespoon of garlic, some cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, a LOT more salt and peeper and more garlic. After the monstrous addition the soup was still bland and near tasteless. I would not recommend this soup, nor would i recommend this as a soup base.

Very good.  I should have sauteed the onions longer...they were still a little crunchy.  I used frozen spinach because I had it on hand, and added fresh oregano and thyme from my garden. Even with being 9 weeks pregnant, it tasted good!

Most canned soups are better than this, if you add your own fresh basil.  The cooking time doesn't allow the bitterness of the tomatoes to cook off, and the sugar meant to counteract the bitterness makes it taste like chef-boy-rd.  If you are trying lo-cal soups, you should start with fresh tomatoes because that is the main taste, if you start with canned, you need to add something more than what's in this recipe.

This is a very good recipe, but like some of the others - I altered it a bit.  The onions do need more time to cook and I used the fine setting on my mandolin to get them much smaller than just chopping.  I also added a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, so it does have a chunkier texture.  You will need to adjust the spices accordingly.

Very good! I made this along with grilled cheese and it was the perfect lunch. I followed the advice of others and cooked the onions for 2-3 minutes longer before adding the milk. Next time I will add an additional cup of spinach, it shrunk so much (as spinach tends to do). I will only add 1/2 the sugar next time. The tomatoes are naturally sweet and the basil also adds a sweetness, I think it could be just as good with 1/2 the sugar.

A wonderful change from plain tomato soup.  I chopped the onion in my food processor to make it more fine and sauted it 3 minutes before adding the garlic.  The texture was great.  I also used tomato sauce instead of tomato puree.  The whole family loved it--even my 3-year-old!

A nice meal when I wanted something quick, easy, nutritious and warm with spinach. I put the milk in after bringing crushed tomatoes to a boil and turning the heat down to medium then cooked for 6 minutes. I used an immersion blender before putting the spinach in. The soup had a very nice texture. I only had dried basil and I cut back on the sugar to about 1 tsp. Very nice and comforting. -35 C outside now so it's the right day for it.

Loved it! This is delicious.  I increased the amount of tomato puree and then realized my pot was too small (so 4x tomato, but only 2x the onion, and milk because it wouldn't fit). Used virgin cold press olive oil instead of butter and added some sage sausage.  This is a very forgiving recipe and excellent combination.  Whole family loves this.  Will make again and make some to freeze for quick left over meals.

I love this soup and make it often.  A few things:  I don't add sugar.  Just canned (or fresh) tomatoes + tomato paste.  I also agree with another reviewer that you should add the milk (or in my case heavy cream-- it is SO good) last.  Enjoy!!

I followed the recipe pretty closely:  used 1/2 a vandalia (sweet) onion since I prefer sweet onions, 1/2 onion = 1-1/2 c. which was more than enough; used half and half (had about 1-3/8 c. so added 1/8 c. of skim milk for 1-1/2 c. of liquid);  used 3 c. (loosely packed) of baby spinach (to finish off my spinach); and added the liquid at the end per other reviews.  The soup was very thick--too thick for my liking.  If I were to make this again, I would increase the milk to about 2 c.  I also would add the spinach after sauteing the onion and garlic and cook until the spinach had wilted, then add the tomato puree.  I like smooth tomato soup so I found the chunkiness from the vegetables rather off-putting.  I will blend the leftovers to see if that makes any difference as far as texture.  I would possibly make this again but only with the changes I've mentioned.  Before I attempt to improve this recipe, I will try others to see if I can find one that is worthy of 5 stars.

I made the soup yesterday and had it for lunch today and it is delicious!  Followed a few of the recommendations of other reviewers:  sauteed the onions longer and added the milk at the end after everything else cooked.  No curdling, but also used 1% milk.  The recipe is extremely easy and quick and so tasty.  Will put it in my regular rotation.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is now my last-minute, go-to recipe.  Unlike most soups; this takes such a short time and with low-salt tomatoes, it can be a healthy choice.  Only change was to add the milk last, as it only makes sense not to boil.  I like the bit of crunch of the onions, so cooking until very soft would be a personal preference.

Just made it tonight. It was so simple quick and so good. 

We like spinach so we doubled the spinach. We also added one pound of shrimp to the soup. Fabulous dinner.

I made 2 substitutions in order to make this non dairy.  I subbed olive oil for the butter in sauteeing the onions and garlic and almond milk (plain) for the regular milk.  The soup came together very quickly and was delicious.  I served it to dinner guests and got rave reviews.  I had just hand chopped the onions and commented to my guests that next time I might use the processor to make them more fine and was told in no uncertain terms NOT to do that, as the chopped onion texture added to the dish.

I added some additional pureed tomatoes to bring back the redness and 2 cups of chicken broth to help thin it out a bit and give it more of a soup rather than spaghetti sauce consistency and flavor. Very enjoyable with these changes.

4 stars for taste and 5 for ease to cook so a 4.5 overall.  I added the milk at the end as suggested!  I added 3 handfuls of baby spinach and used 1/8 tsp of garlic powder since I forgot to buy garlic!

Great recipe!  I've made it 4 times.  This last time enough for 12.  I used 28ozs. of diced petite tomatoes since I was short on the tomato puree.  I also took the time to purée it in my blender. Fabulous!!!

Substitute sugar with finely chopped carrots cooked along with the onions. The cream is added later than what the recipe calls.

I used fresh tomatoes because I had them and they needed to be used. I used skim milk, so I added 1/3 cup heavy cream at the very end. This was so delicious, my husband proclaimed it "magnificent!"

This recipe was very easy to make.  However I did make a couple of changes as I am trying to stay away from processed foods as much as possible.  I replaced whole milk with coconut milk and pureed 8 fresh tomatoes, simmering them for fourty minutes before adding the basil and spinach. An additional teaspoon of sugar was necessary. The end result was a very fresh, flavorful soup.

I took the reviews to heart and didn't add the milk until the heat was off and it was hot & ready to serve, and it was creamy & perfect. Also I bumped up the spice level a notch by sauteeing a dried chili, extra garlic, some coriander seeds and cumin seeds in with the onions. I also topped with chopped coriander (cilantro) leaves and got lots of compliments!

I added the milk last and I found that it was as quick and simple as the directions stated. I also pureed before serving it--so I did not have to worry about any onion chunks. It tasted great! My wife loved it.

Excellent, healthy and satisfying soup.   Easy to make and great with J.P's Big Daddy Biscuits!  I made exactly as written.  Only difference was I let the soup simmer about 20 minutes.

good with dippers (pillsbury pizza dough with mozzarella). milk curdled even though i added it last. might have to add it when the soup has cooled more. i couldn't taste the 1/4 cup of fresh basil. next time i'll add some dried basil.

I used dried basil instead of fresh because my basil plant had lost it's leaves for the winter. It  just tasted like spaghetti sauce (good spaghetti sauce). Perhaps it would have been better with fresh basil.

Excellent recipe, although I did substitute the tomato puree with tomatoe soup. and I didnt add any extra sugar since the soup already had high fructose corn syrup in it. It was wonderful though! although my boyfriend said it was a bit two sweet, but I can't blame the recipe for that.

Taste was ok but it was not as smooth of a soup as I was looking for. I did follow the advice of others and cooked spinach longer and added the milk last.

Great recipe. Easy to make, quick and delicious.  I have made it exactly as described, also made it with some diced tomatoes added. Delicious both ways.

Healthy and easy to make.  My kids thought it tasted like spaghetti sauce and wanted it with noodles.  I put the milk in after boiling as suggested by other reviewers, I also cut back the salt to a pinch since there was salt in the canned tomatoes.  I used canned diced tomatoes since that is what I had on hand and put them in the blender before cooking.  I am looking forward to cooking this with fresh tomatoes in the summer.

This was ok...I made it as directed, maybe added a little extra spinach. I agree with another reviewer that it kind of tastes like pasta sauce...

My husband LOVED this soup.  I thought it was ok.  I think I would have liked it more if there were less canned tomatoes (more fresh) and if the basil were chopped more.  Still...it was ok.

This was so delicious! I added 1.5 cups of cheese tortellini to it just to make sure I could serve it as a meal in itself with out my husband and son wondering if there was more in the oven...perfect. I will for sure make this again this winter. Thanks for posting a great recipe!

This was very disappointing.  Something just wasn't right. It tasted like I was eating a sauce with milk added into it. Don't know what I did wrong, but I will not be making this again.

As Is: has too much onion overpowering the tomato. To adjust to my taste/make it a personal five stars (it will be sticking around with a couple changes) I cut back to half an onion. To make the texture smoother I put everything except the spinach in the blender

This is great! I use less onion and more garlic for our personal taste. I also use an immersion blender to deal with any chunks and the curdled milk, (though will try adding milk last per another reviewer this time.) It is husband approved and he requests it frequently. Thank you for such a great recipe!

Only change I made was to delete the sugar and it was totally awesome.  The sugar probably wouldn't make a lot of difference...I just don't like sweet.

Delicious! I pureed my own tomatoes by first boiling them and then plunging them in an icewater bath to remove the skins, then coring, and putting in the food processor. Very yummy!

I just made this soup today. It was very easy and a tasty tomato soup.  My husband likes Tomato soup although I have never really been fond of it myself.  The only comment I would like to make is that it was not as creamy as I thought it would be and that may be because I was using 2% milk.  I think the next time I will try half and half.  We are going to have it again tomorrow with Challa bread.   Thanks for the experience.

Great recipe, my 4 year old daughter loved it.  I did modify it just a little...I used 3 hand fulls of spinach, 1 can of italian diced tomatos and 1 can of regular diced tomatos (blended in the blender), spices and lots of parmesan cheese (2 hand fulls, maybe).  I completly forgot the milk.  Great taste and flavor...froze left overs.  WILL make again!!!

Unfortunately, this soup was a bust for me. The end result tasted like ketchup with a thick, overpowering flavor of onion. The consistency was far too chunky and thick, even after adding milk, blending the soup, and adding water. After much improvisation and addition of lots of black pepper, it was just edible at best :(

I like thick soups, but this was a bit much.  It had the consistency of a tomato sauce.  I used twice as much milk as what the recipe called for; however, it never seemed to get more soup-like.  The taste was okay, nothing fabulous.  It was very easy to make, but I doubt I'll make it again.

It was Ok but lacked the flavor sensation I was expecting.  Some hot pepper flakes or using roasted tomatoes instead of crushed canned tomatoes would give this recipe more of an edge.

My husband and I fixed this tonight together, along with the grilled cheese, basil, and tomato sandwich on this site. 
Very good!  We skipped the onions altogether, used soy milk (dairy allergy), and my hubby added crushed red pepper to his, to make it his "5". (Otherwise, without the red pepper, he said it would be a "4".) 
The tomato adds a touch of sweetness and the pepper adds heat.     
Timewise, this was a quick meal. It took about the same amount of time as the menu said it would. 
When we were all done, my Campbell's hubby added "we can fix this again any time!" so it may become a staple in our kitchen... Oooh, by the way, hubby suggested after our meal that we add sausage and hamburger meat and use this the next time we make spaghetti sauce! Thanks Dakota...

Very easy and very good. I made a couple of substitutions (only cause I had ingredients) - shallots for onions and heavy cream (there goes healthy) for milk.

I followed the advice to sautee the onions for longer and puree the final result for better texture - both of which helped. Nonetheless as another reviewer mentioned the end product was more a thick marinara sauce than a hearty soup! I think I will add some more milk next time; I just think it is a matter of tweaking the recipe.

I'm not a big tomato soup fan but this was a nice twist. It tasted a bit like a marinara sauce but I would make it again.

I made this soup for my vegetarian daughter to take home and keep in the fridge for a quick meal...I also cooked the onions and garlic for 5 mins and used 2 cans of italian diced tomatoes + 1 Tbls of tomato paste. After it cooled a bit I pureed in the blender for better consistency. I love the flavor and will suggest she serve with grilled cheese sandwiches!!

I actually plan on making this soup for my 'smallish' wedding. Delicious, simple and beautiful! I agree with everyone else about cooking the onions longer- just add the garlic a little later so it doesn't burn. 

I also used half the amount called for the butter and subbed in olive oil- and skipped the cheese to make this low fat.

THANKS!

Very flavorful dish. I took previous raters' suggestions and sauteed the onions/garlic for about 5-6 min. But I tried skim milk instead of 2%, and the texture wasn't quite as creamy as I'd like, but still delicious with the parmesan cheese sprinkled on it and some whole wheat toast on the side.

Super quick, very tasty (especially if you love tomatoes, like me!).
