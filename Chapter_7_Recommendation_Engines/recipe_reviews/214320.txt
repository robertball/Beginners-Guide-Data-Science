I made this dessert a little lighter using sugar free jello and homemade vanilla frozen yogurt (made with nonfat plain greek yogurt--thank you, Pinterest!). I think this is good but it would have been better with just one cup of the frozen yogurt, it was a little too creamy. I want a more even balance of "fruit" and "cream". I'll try it again with just a cup of frozen yogurt, then re-review. NOTE: This fed four, not six.

I love that this is a super fast and easy dessert to whip up, with ingredients you are likely to always have at hand. It is also very versatile in that the varieties are endless. I used Jello Fruit Medley, with a cup of crushed pineapple I needed to use up, and mango frozen yogurt. Topped with a fresh fruit medley, a dab of whip cream and a sprinkle of toasted coconut.

In texture, this is more like a mousse as others have noted.  It does firm up, but be prepared to let it chill longer than the recipe states if you want it firm.  Don't expect it to firm up to jello firmness,  but it will hold it's shape when firm.  It probably firmed up in several hours, not 30 minutes.  In flavor, this is interesting.  Kind of tangy like jello but with a softer flavor from the ice cream.  I did change the flavor of the ice cream and jello, though.  I don't have vanilla and thought strawberry ice cream would be perfect since I have it--and it worked, but it wasn't until I went to grab the jello that I realized I didn't have any strawberry jello--instead, I had black cherry.  Not quite the most salubrious flavor combo, but I kind of like it.  I will try again with strawberry jello and ice cream to see if that makes it more appealing to the bf.  When the recipe says 6 servings, it means 6 SMALL servings--I ended up with 5 servings bc I filled my jello cups--maybe 3/4 full would've worked to make 6.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was the only one who ate any of this, and I thought it was just okay.  The cups just never really seemed to firm up like I was hoping they would.  I was thinking they would be more like jello-o, but they were more like a loose pudding.  They did look very nice, and had a double layer look to them.  I did use strawberry jell-o and topped these with diced strawberries and toasted coconut.

I made this for a small memorial day dinner with family, and everyone adored it! It was so easy to make, too. I wish the recipe would've mentioned that it only makes 6 SMALL servings, because when I went to pour the mixture into sundae glasses, it only filled 3, but thankfully I had an extra cherry Jell-O packet. :) Use the Cool Whip on moderation, as it makes it veeery rich! The whole family agreed it would be even better with crumbled graham crackers in the middle. I reccommend this recipe for everyone to try, especially if you're too busy or don't have much time to make a cake or pie. (I actually prefer this over cake!)

I made these for a Memorial Day gathering. I thought they were cute and fun but the guests didnt seem too excited about them as they usually are. I think they would have rather had cake or something. They were super easy to make, took probably 5 minutes and were tasty. Definitely a jello texture.
