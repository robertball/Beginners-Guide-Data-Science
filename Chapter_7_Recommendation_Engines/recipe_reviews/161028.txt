Who would have thought that it would be this good.  The meat was a little chewy...but that does not reflect on the recipe itsself.  The only thing I changed was the extra cup of butter.  I could not force myself to put that much butter into it and it turned out great.  I'm sure that it would have tasted better with it but just to let you know that it was wonderful without the extra fat clogging your arteries.

I scaled this recipe in half, used ground venison instead of stew meat, and used frozen veggies in place of the can to try and cut back on the sodium. This was super simple and a great way to use up some of that venison in my freezer...not to mention I love soup! Thank you for sharing logansmommy!

I didn't read the recipe closely enough and had to dig out my chili pot to hold everything. This is an excellent recipe, even my kids love it!

First and foremost, this makes a TON of soup!!! Make sure your pot is big enough!!! I made this recipe exactly like it's written with the exception of completely omitting the butter and using frozen veggies instead of canned. I just didn't see the need for the butter with all the other excellent flavors in the soup and wanted to cut down on the calories. I will definitely be making this again!!!

This was delicious!  Even my picky kids ate it up!  I used frozen veggies instead of canned for less salt and more nutrients.  I also omitted the cup of butter but did use a couple pats of dairy-free spread.

Great recipe  I tweak it a little to suit our tastes. I do omit the additional CUP of butter. I sweat the cabbage and onions in the initial 1/2 cup of butter initially and then continue with the recipe.

The soup I will always make when we have some deer meat. Thank you so much for the recipes. After making it for several times, I make some adjustments to my taste : I use 1/2 cup of butter only, all fresh veggies, no peas, brussel sprout for cabbage, using chicken stock/granules if they are available, using 1 tablespoon instead of a pinch for each spice, and simmer it longer (2-3 hours) until the raw carrot's taste gone. It's frozen good too !

I had most of the ingredients but my pantry was pretty bare.  Was missing the tomato juice but didnt make a difference.  Its was still pretty good.  A couple minor deviations on veggies and pow---pretty good.

I halved the recipe. And used what I had (no canned tomato's) tomato sauce, ground deerburger & didn't have parsley. But it still turned out great! Not to gamey tasting at all. Thanks!

Very tasty! We added bow tie pasta for some of the picky eaters at our house. Excellent with bread too! I left out the 1 cup of butter and skimmed the fat while it simmered.
