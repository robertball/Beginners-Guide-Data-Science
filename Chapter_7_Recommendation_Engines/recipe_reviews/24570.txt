This tasted nothing like the Cretons de Quebec I've had in Canada. I modified to the following: 1 pound lean ground pork 1 cup whole milk 1 cup whole wheat fresh bread crumbs 1 onion finely chopped 2 cloves of garlic crushed and chopped 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ground cloves 1 tsp dry parsley 1/2 tsp dry marjoram 1/4 tsp allspice and 1 tsp ground black pepper. I also zapped in the food processor for just a two-three pulses to give it a creamier texture. This came much closer to what I've tasted in cafes.

I have been making cretons for years and I have never cooked the pork before adding milk. Also if you are going to add onion may I suggest you use dehydrated onions as fresh end up making your cretons slightly slimy. I add cinnamon sea salt black pepper(a generous amount) and a tea spoon of chicken stock powder for extra flavor. For best results use whole milk especially if you are using lean pork. I always get rave reviews for my cretons even from my very english friends that hesitated eating the gray block of meat I was serving them!
