The dish is a nice idea but the tomatillos have a very sourish flavor once roasted.  You will need to cut the flavor with a small amount of suger.

This was a great recipe! I did put a tablespoon of sugar in the blender with the tomatillos and peppers but that is all I changed.  When I tasted the sauce at first I thought  WOW!  this is hot but after it cooked it had just the right amount of spice!  I made rice to eat with it!

Simple and tasty!  Like everyone else, we looked for a recipe to use the tomatillos from our garden. We made slight modifications to this recipe because we did not have all the ingredients on hand and we prefer baked chicken. We used fresh serrano peppers instead of dried peppers and added garlic salt in the blender. We put the chicken breasts in a baking dish, covered them with the tomatillo salsa, and baked covered for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. I underestimated the heat of the serrano peppers, but we solved that issue with a little sour cream. Served with a side of Spanish quinoa-brown rice blend, this meal was a hit!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

great, did not have dried chilis, use fresh red peppers and one jalepeno pepper.  Loved the flavor and how it accented the chicken
