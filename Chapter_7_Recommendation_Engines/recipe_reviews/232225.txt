The cake recipe itself was great. I was concerned that it might not be quite chocolately enough with just the cocoa powder, so I took a dark chocolate bar and grated it into the dry ingredients before mixing them into the wet. The cake was very moist and everyone loved it. The frosting was very, very sweet--too sweet for me. Again, it wasn't very chocolatey so I actually almost doubled the amount of cocoa powder, but I think when I make this cake again I'll use a different frosting recipe. I did like the frosting consistency, though.

This recipe is amazing! I have spent a long time trying to find a great chocolate cake recipe that isn't too overwhelming in a chocolate taste that isn't sweet. This literally tastes like a milk chocolate cake! I did add about half a cup more flour and made cupcakes. Mine took around 15-20 minutes to cook and I added a cream cheese frosting. I will be recommending this to other bakers and be using it as my go to recipe from now on!

I thought this cake was really moist, rich and chocolaty.  I loved the frosting - a combo of whipped cream and buttercream.  next time I think I will make it in two 9-inch pans instead of the 13 x 9.  It is a tad dense.

617.19 ...  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232225/yost-chocolate-cake/ ... This is good cake!  It rivals my favorite.  Yeah, itâ€™s that good.  Other than using my personal frosting recipe & decreasing oil & sugar by 1/4c each - oh, wait - oops.  I also subbed coffee for the water.   Okay, that really is all.   This is a really good, moist cake!   Thanks, Joy!

Fantastic!  Made for my husband's birthday.  It was a huge hit.  One guest who isn't a cake fan had two slices.  Very moist and delicious.  I omitted the cocoa from the frosting.

I made this as my first cake from scratch and turned it into my sons zombie birthday cake. I added strawberry filling in between. It was delicious and so moist! I added a little more coco than required but other than that I didn't change a thing. My son loves mocha frosting that I use so I didn't use the frosting in this recipe but as awesome as the cake turned out I wouldn't mind using the frosting next time!
