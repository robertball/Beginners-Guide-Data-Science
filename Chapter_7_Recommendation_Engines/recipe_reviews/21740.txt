When I made this recipe I did make some changes.  Instead of 1 tablespoon of tomato paste I put in 2 tablespoons.  I also put in 1 and half cups of water instead of a quarter cup.  Also, sometimes tomatoes from a can can taste kind of yucky so I added 5 fresh tomatoes.  I do agree that there was not enough sauce so next time I think I'll add more sauce.  The last change I made is I put in cilantro (I think about 3 tablespoons).

this was just all right for me.  It definately needed more sauce, when it was all cooked and done it seemed like nothing more than tomatoes and onions.  If I make it again I will add a can of tomato sauce.

The sauce is wounderful and my son loved it. But one draw back the suace was not enough for one pound of spagetti. I would change to recipe to have double the liquid portion of the recipe.

Pretty straightforward recipe. I read the other reviews about there not being enough sauce and they were right. I minced the onions and added a couple of fresh tomatoes at the end because there wasn't any sauce left once I added the spaghetti, so definitely add more tomatoes. Next time I'll double the sauce but not the paste all for the same amount of spaghetti. Thank you Natalie, for the recipe.

I love onions so I thought this would be a great recipe to try.  It was good but it seemed like the dish was lacking something.  Maybe if I had had some shredded parm that would have helped.  Of course the fact that I didn't use fresh basil may have really taken away from the overall flavor.  I'm sure I'll try it again with a few minor adjustments.

This is basically how I make spaghetti. I usually use about 2 onions, a large can of petite diced tomatoes and a regular can of tomato sauce. We used to go to granny's every Sunday and she would have this on the table every now and then. It was just plain spaghetti and some kind of tomato something with it. I'd seen her plop a whole stick of butter in it! I've done it a few times, when I felt the urge. I've tried many different variations and this is the closest I could get to what she made. This is the only spaghetti I eat.

I thought this was great. I think a lot of chefs out there need to read the title, Onion and Spaghetti. This should answer the main complaint about too little sauce.

I am not a fan of spaghetti. I don't care for the flavor of spaghetti sauce. I love eating noodles with a little butter and a sprinkle of Parmesan. 
Your recipe was a nice change. I love onions and the tomato sauce was very light. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Quick, easy and light.

This was really tasty! I used 2 large and 1 medium onion. Next time I'll add more garlic, some red pepper flakes, and kalamata olives.

I have made veg, pastas for a minute.  To imply they even resemble a bolognese sauce is kinda incredulous. This is my first review, and I'm sorry it's yours,but, this is a typical sauce with an onion added.  No bullion to even simulate the effect of meat...  if I want a faux bolognese, I would add a little (1/4 tsp) of beef bullion.  Maybe to add texture, chopped chickpeas.  Can't blend or process as they will become humus style texture.  BUT!, and all in all, I love, LOVE! This recipe as I have made it numerous times myself for a good veg dish that tantalizes the palate.  
I apologize if it appeared harsh, but it's time for reviews that have meaning for the poster.  Looking forward to more from you!

Chris

Great basic recipe!  I add in a ton of fresh minced garlic and only fresh veggies - nothing out of a can, half cup each of fresh basil and parsley and a few sprigs of fresh oregano.  Get creative!  Any vegetables in season will work.  We do not eat pasta often but when we do, we make it yummy!

This is delicious! I made a few changes, but there is no reason you shouldn't get 5 stars just because I altered it. The original recipe should never be graded low because someone changed it and didn't like the result.
I did add a couple slabs of butter to make it richer, I seldom measure my ingredients and always add more garlic, and all I had in the cupboard for tomatoes was diced tomatoes with peppers - so mine had a bit more kick, which I enjoy.
Thank you for this recipe! I'll be making it again AS WRITTEN in the future!

After reading the reviews I doubled the sauce and spices for this as I like lots of sauce on my spaghetti. This was extremely good and even better the next day. Definitely a repeat. Thank you.

Update: I have made this so many times now. Instead of plain water I always use some of the pasta water. Last night I needed to use up half a jar of spaghetti sauce so I used that in place of the tomatoes. You really can't go wrong with this one. It has become a staple here and made at least twice a month.

Next time, I`ll add more spices to it because the onion taste was a bit overpowering. I liked how fast it was to make.

My family loved this recipe and so did I. Especially the sauce. I loved this sauce. I did however have to decrease the onions because of my heartburn problems. But it wouldn't have worked  w/o them!
Great recipe. I'll make this again and next time add some mushrooms to it.

I made this for a meatless Monday, and my family loved it.  I added one more onion, a red pepper, 1 tsp of Marjoram and a tablespoon more of tomato paste.  Also had to add a bit more water.....but it is so tasty.  Will make it again!!  Enjoy!

I tried this the other night.  The only thing I did different was I added a half of green and red bell pepper because I needed to cook them or lose them.   My husband and I  thought it was very good.  I also used sweet onions.  I had to use dried basil but the next time I make it  I'll  go to the store and buy fresh.

this recipe is NOT a "spaghetti" recipe. it can be, if you use a Heavier sauce, meat, veggies, yes all are addable, but this recipe is great as is!   I use it as a side dish to pork chops, baked chicken, steak, other meats NOT "Italian-like."  I was reading the reviews and if you are looking for a good ITALIAN SPAGHETTI recipe THIS is not it! but if you want a nice side dish to meat, a pasta side dish for a pot luck, this is wonderful.  thnx ffor a great way to lighten up a pasta dish, with out all the tomato heaviness.

I have to say, I wasn't expecting this to be this good.  But really, it was.  That. Good.   I probably used double the garlic (Didn't measure) and doubled the tomato paste and water and halved the spaghetti and onions so I would have more sauce based on other people's  reviews but the flavor was just delicious.  I also added zuchini for an even more vegetarian flare.  I will definitely make this again!

I made it with the following adjustments: 1 can of tomato paste,1/4 cup chicken broth, just two onions, stewed tomatoes.  I followed all the directions. It was really delicious!
I have it a 4 star because of all the changes I made

It was very good and fairly easy to make. Only thing we did different was we used some tomatoes from our garden that we'd frozen instead of the canned tomatoes. I'm sure that added to the flavor. I will make it again. Nice change from rich sauces.

We named this Red Spaghetti.  When my children were growing up, we had what we called "gourmet" lunches on Saturday (potato soup, corn chowder, etc.) served with cornbread. Yes, this recipe needs more tomatoes.  Black pepper, salt and sugar (always add sugar when tomatoes are in a recipe) were the only seasonings I used (no garlic, basil or tomato paste).  And, of course, I used bacon drippings - because back then I still made bacon and eggs most mornings and saved the drippings for later use.  I am from the South, I like slaw or potato salad with fried catfish, but most African Americans that I know eat red spaghetti with fried catfish.
