I saw that the recipe had no leavening ingredients but decided to make it "as written" in case coconut had some magical power that I didn't know about. It doesn't. This recipe produced the equivalent of coconut biscuits. I'll be using it as a base for stewed fruit.

I really hate to leave a negative review but am doing so to bring attention to the submitter that something is definitely missing in this recipe. I make a crustless  coconut pie that the photo of this cake reminded me of. So thought I’d give it a try because the photo looks moist and chewy and quite delicious. Mine baked up to about a quarter inch tall and was rubbery and very pale. My first thought was it needs leavening or smaller dish. I made it again but added another egg and butter (like my pie recipe) and baked it in a smaller pan. It’s taller, but still pale with not much taste. So, please help all of us with this so it will look like the photo! I will be glad to change my rating if the problem with the recipe is fixed and it turns out like the picture! (I was waiting to see other reviews just to see if they had trouble too and they did.)

I'm sorry I can only give this recipe 1 star. The pic looks so delicious but I was not pleased with how this cake turned out. I followed the directions you gave but my cake turned out like leather not fluffy like the one in the pic. Are you sure this is the right kind of flour or are you missing out some ingredients like baking powder and baking soda? I will try once more to make it adding the baking soda and baking powder but if its another flop I'll never make it again.

Tastes nice but its really thick and flat, so either add some baking powder to it or use cake flour not all purpose.

I made it with Splenda(R) Blend due to Diabetics in family and the amount of sugar already in the processed coconut, but my cake looks nothing like the light/fluffy one in the picture.  Are we missing Baking Powder or Baking Soda or Cream of Tartar?  I am also going to try it next time with a 9x7 pan instead of the 9x13 because I think that's part of it.  Also, kinda tastes flat - so will be adding a little salt (1/2 tsp) to bring out the sweetness.

Like the other reviews - thin, like coconut with flour.
