MMMMmmm ive been looking for a recipe like this.  Although I did change it a bit when I made it.  I made half the recipe (otherwise we would eat them all) and still got many cookies. I used rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats. Instead of adding each individual spice I added 3 tsp (6 in a full recipe) of pumpkin pie spice which comtains; cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cloves. I also added about a cup of raisins.  These cookies were gone in a matter of hours. YUM oh and as others said....8 minutes did it for me too.

I found this recipe about 6 years ago on this site and it has become one of our absolute family favorites ever since -- I love spices and these are ohh sooo good!!! perfect taste, chewy on the inside and with a slight crunch on the outside. I usually prepare the batter and freeze it up in little balls -- just pop them in the oven for a quick treat :)

I cut down on the baking time so that they weren't so crispy.  The best part is that they stay moist for days if stored with a slice of bread.  Overall these were a hit.  Delicious and easy.

These are absolutely fantastic!  I can't keep the cookie jar full, they're eaten before I have a chance to wash the cookie sheet. I thought at first that there might be too much spice but I made them as the recipe said and we just love them.  Don't change a thing. Thanks kedend

These were good the first day, but not as good as the quaker oats recipe.  By the third day, they were dry and hard.  Kind of a disappointment.

Although these cookies were okay, they were not Dad's Oatmeal Cookies from Baltimore.  I grew up on Dad's Oatmeal Cookies and was heartbroken when they left from off of Pratt Street They weren't this spicy.  Some of the spices need to be eliminated.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever made. I cut the amount of cloves in half because I thought it might be a little strong.

I have struggled to find a recipe for oatmeal cookies that has that just-right chewy texture and cinnamon spice flavor like my mom used to make.  This one is it!  Other recipes made weird, puffy, cookies that were dry and salty. The main modification I made is that I never used cloves (because I never have any, and I usually use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavor shortening.  The kids love them!

These were good - my kids LOVED them - the only change I made was to add some raisins. They were a bit "cakey" for me though.

This recipe is awesome.  I'm going to a cookie exchange and I wanted to test this recipe.  It passed with flying colors.  Note: I made these cookies with only cinnamon (doubled required amount) and baked them for 7 minutes on 350 degrees.  It makes a very tasty, moist, and chewy cookie.

These came out okay. I halved the recipe but still followed everything. They came out more "bready" than what I expect a chewy cookie to taste like. My husband liked them, but we're still searching.

Absolutely wonderful!  Since I didn't make the receipe exactly, I feel I can't give it all 5 stars, but I would like to! I didn't have Allspice, and even though I LOVE the taste of spices, I wasn't sure my coworkers would as much.  So I adjusted the spices a bit: I left the Cinnamon at 2 tsp, I put in 1.5 tsp of Nutmeg and 1.25 tsp of Cloves.  These came out chewy with just a hint of crunch, perfect, just how I like them!  Everyone's loved them at work so far as well!  Thanks!

I've made a few changes that I think more closely replicate the original cookie as I remember it. They were more crunchy and flater.

I reduced cloves (1 tsp), removed salt, reduced baking soda in half and added 1 tsp each ginger & nutmeg, and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans. I also process oats until almost a powder. Lastly, I place a doz. per baking sheet with parchment paper and press between a 2nd baking sheet to flatten and I bake at 350 degrees for 9 min. 

Still can't get the color right...need to be a darker brown! Any ideas???

I have been searching for an oatmeal cookie recipe that is similar to the cookies my boyfriend's grandmother used to bake him when he was little.  These were fantastic!  I didn't have any allspice or cloves, but added ginger and nutmeg instead.  We will definitley be making these again soon!

Terrific recipe! I make these all the time. I omitted the allspice all together though and used ginger instead, same measurement. I also use whole wheat flour and all brown sugar for health reasons. I like this recipe b/c I can change it to my preferences and it still tastes great.Definatly not too spicy!!

Wow! These are delicious! I added 1 cup of cinnamon chips to the batch and will do that again! I brought the butter to room temperature so I did not wait 2 hours before baking. I used a stone for some cookies and non stick foil on other pans, no sticking! Also, I did not flatten the dough balls and they did great! These are spicy but this is exactly what we like! One problem, my oven runs fast and hot and mine were done in 8 minutes. The first batch got overdone. Just watch your oven. Thanks for a FABULOUS recipe that is a keeper!

This recipe turned out so good!  We added Chocolate Chips to our batch and my husband and I just loved them.  I'm not real big on Oatmeal cookies but the spices really made the cookie taste perfect!  The spices in the cookie made the whole house smell great for the holidays when they were baking in the oven!  We'll be making these again!

This IS a great recipe.  If you like the spices called for, don't hold back on the amounts listed.  I baked mine for 9 minutes a batch, so they weren't so crispy, and plan on throwing a piece of bread in the container with them to help maintain moisture.  I measured these in a 1 TBSP scoop, and I came up with 6 dozen cookies.

My family said that I have never baked a cookie better than these ones I made.  They went over well with everyone at Christmas.  An excellent recipe.  Also, can add chocolate chips or raisins to them for an even bigger crowd pleaser!

I think this is a good recipe.  I loved Dad's Oatmeal Cookies as a child. This recipe is close to it.  Some have said in their reviews that the recipe as written is too spicy and I agree so I went with all the cinnamon and cut in half the allspice and cloves - seemed much better.

chewy cookie which is the good part but the spices make this cookie very over powering.  If I make this cookie again I am definetly skipping out the allspice and cloves.

This are pretty good oatmeal cookies.  I took them over to a friends house for a dessert and they all loved them.  I used Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the other spices and it was delicious.

I've made these several times & have made a few adjustments to my liking, although they are GREAT as is.  I personally LOVE spicy cookies, so these were IT for me.  Instead of allspice though, I added about 1 tsp each of nutmeg and cardamom.  In another batch, I have also added ground ginger which made the cookies reminiscent of gingerbread.  Also have made an "apple-cinnamon" variety by adding finely chopped apple, & extra cinnamon.  I haven't made a combination that wasn't embraced by the people I share it with!  Some changes that I always make: I cut the white sugar to a half cup & use splenda, add more oatmeal (1/2 cup to 1 cup more - I like my cookies with that nutty texture), and I bake them a few minutes longer b/c I like my cookies crunchy/crispy.

These are fabulous...my husband and children are in heaven!  They are nice and crispy on the outside, and soft in the middle with an unresistable spicy flavor.  I did bake them just a bit longer than the 10 minutes so they were nice and golden.  So good!

These are the best cookies I have had in a long time.  They are so fast and so good.  The only thing I changed is I used Whole Wheat Flour.  But I don't think that it made a difference.

Splendid cookies!  Gone within a day.  My family likes raisins and pecans, so I added them to half the dough and those were also delicious.  Made them twice in 10 days!

These were delicious and disappeared in no time!  I halved the recipie, and it gave me 30 cookies.  The only changes I made were to put in half the cloves(I used 1/2 a teaspoon, so a full teaspoon on the full recipie) and I used regular cooking oats, not quick cooking.  I also only baked these for 8 minutes, not 10, and they came out perfect.  10 minutes would have burnt them in my oven, but that's an oven to oven thing.  These will certainly be made in this house again!!

DEFINITELY a spice cookie, for the record. But a tasty one, I think I'll make these again at Christmas time. I put in 1/4 of the amount of spices required, and the spices were still strong enough, I can't imagine 2 tbsp of each. I think you would have to cut back even MORE (than 1/4) on the spices for it to really taste like Dad's cookies.

These were so good.  I did overbake them, although it says to watch it.  I have          an 11 month old baby to watch and I got distracted.  But, even with the slightly burnt taste, they were good.  I will make these again, when someone else is home to watch my baby!  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were good, but not what I was looking for.  I think they should change the name to Oatmeal Spice cookies.  Certainly not the traditional oatmeal cookie.  Easy to make, but be sure to note in the instructions where you have to wait two hours after you have prepared the dough to actually bake.....can be a big inconvenience.

These are without a doubt the best I have ever made. The spices really add to the recipe but based on one's taste. We like ours with raisins and chopped walnuts so I only add approx 2 cups of the oats.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would.  I have never had such a great cookie.  It is spicy but not savory.  I gave them to a few neighbors and they were just ecstatic!  I didn't change a thing and the cookies were unbelievable.

TASTY! Very good. Used OAT flour (have a wheat allergy) in place of the wheat flour and you really couldn't tell a difference (it might have been a tad sweeter). Excellent taste and easy to make! The cookies are less fragile if you use a full tablespoon or more of dough when putting them onto the cookie sheet; Otherwise they tend to crack upon removal if too thin. All around great recipe! Thanks for the post!

Sorry, I know it has received rave reviews, but in my opinion they were too soggy, too sweet and too hard to get off the tray.  Not worth the effort.

Oh.my.delicious! You seriously need to make these. My family absolutely loved these cookies. The spices give them such a nice, different flavor. Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I slightly under cooked them (baked for 8 min) and they stayed fresh for several days. Thanks for this great recipe. We will make this over and over again.

This is an excellent cookie.  I substituted applesauce for all of the butter, used Old Fashioned in place of Quick Cooking Oats, lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper, and did not flattened them.  I was surprised and nervous about the amount of spices in this recipe, but I am very much enjoying the final result.  I will make these again, but may add a little ginger as another reviewer mentioned.

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!  They are my all-time favorite. I've even made them with splenda and whole wheat flour and they still are amazing. Of course, the original recipe is THE best, but at the rate I eat these cookies, I need to lower the calories and up the nutritional value!

Our family didn't care for these cookies at all.  There was way too much allspice and cloves.  I had a bad after taste for hours. The allspice and cloves should be cut to 1/4 tsp.

Not quite what I was expecting, but these were still tasty, and really easy to make. A nice, "Oatmeal-spice" type cookie I guess. I might put raisins in them next time.

Great cookie.  I used unsalted butter, kosher salt, and baked on Silpat. Nice, crispy and no mess.

Excellent recipe.  I divided the dough and made chocolate chip, raisin and plain batches.  My hubby loves these and they never last long.  The dough freezes well, too. Thank you for a great recipe.

These were the best oatmeal cookies.I added 1 1/3 cups of flake coconut, 1 cup of pecan chips,1 cup of baking raisins,and about 2/3 of a cup of walnut pieces. I also halved the cloves.

I wasn't a big fan of these cookies...if I decide to try them again, I would decrease the amount of clove in it. I feel this has some potential to be a regular recipe for me, however I found them to be a little too strong for my taste.

The are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made that turned out right.  I used 1 1/2 to 2 cups of oatmeal instead of 3 cups and added chocolate chips.  They have been renamed the best oatmeal cookies in the world. Even though I had to wait the two hours they had to sit on my counter.  They were yummy!
