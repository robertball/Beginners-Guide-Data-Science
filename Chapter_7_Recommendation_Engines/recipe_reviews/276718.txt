Simple, but low-key festive and fancy with the "gremolata!" Saw it in the magazine and had most of the ingredients on hand, save for the sun-dried tomatoes. The gremolata really makes the recipe special. Definitely make a little extra! The pop of parsley and the earthy sun-dried tomatoes added freshness and also, christmas vibes with the colors!

As with all soups, tasted better then next day. Only things I modified were that  I added a few more dried herbs I had on hand, I think basil and oregano (and likely some garlic powder) and deglazed the veggies in white wine before adding the broth.

Would make again!

This was delicious and as the recipe submitter stated, the gremolata took the soup to the next level!  I am a meat person and was so surprised how much i enjoyed this without adding ham or kielbasa like I normally would for split pea soup. We enjoyed it with some garlic bread.  I will be making this again for sure!

Soup was ok. gremolata;wasn't crazy about it . Used dried sun dried tomatoes, maybe should have used the ones that are in a jar and moist. 
  Seemed to be missing something. Guess I'm used to split pea made with ham bone.

We will defiantly make this again. We loved it! My grocery store did not have split peas, so I use lentils and added a red and a yellow carrot and a teaspoon of Turmeric.

I made this recipe exactly as written--it was delicious.  I have two portions in the freezer to eat another time, but the rest is already gone-it was that good.  It was easy to make and very economical.

Nope. I got this recipe out of the AR January 2020 magazine in hopes of adding to the family’s meat free meal rotation. The time given did not allow for the dried split peas to soften enough. We were chewing through the soup even after having blended it with an immersion blender for a minute. The taste wasn’t pleasant and we just weren’t fans. Bummed because it looked so good in the magazine and it was very time consuming.
