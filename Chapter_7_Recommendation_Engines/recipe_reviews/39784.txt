I used frozen swedish meatballs but did make the sauce with the following changes.  I did not use any meat drippings.  Melted 1/2 stick of butter in a pan and added just a bit more than 1/4 cup flour.  After adding the rest of the ingredients I also added a bit of onion powder, a bit more dill than called for and a tsp. of salt.  This was perfect swedish meatball gravy!  Yummy.  Everybody liked it.

My husband's grandfather is always talking about a meatball dish that his late wife used to make that was a family favorite.  I searched several websites and many recipes before finding this one.

It was a hit on the first try.  Now we have Mimi's secret meatball recipe.  We all loved it.  It was delicious and a lot easier to make than I thought it would be.

It has now become one of our family favorites.  
Thanks
Susie

Made my own meatballs, but started off with their sauce recipe. Had to make some additions: 1 Tbls. Wocestershire sauce, 1 tsp. garlic salt, and 1 Tbls. parsley. Substituted 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg for the dill (nutmeg is the original flavor of Swedish Meatballs). I also added 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms. It was very good with the changes.

This was a nice easy recipe and it tasted good with a little added salt and garlic in the sauce. Took the suggestion from another review and used butter instead of oil. I think it was a wise choice. Will surely make it again.

I made these with ground chicken and they were really good. I had to add extra bread crumbs because the ground chicken was very moist. I also did not have dry milk so I added 2 tbls of evaporated milk to the bread crumbs and cut back on the water(used 1/4 cup). Im not a fan of garlic salt so I used kosher salt instead. Also I added a few shakes of worcestershire sauce to the mixture (approx 1 tsp). As for the gravy I used 1 can of  low sodium beef broth and cut back on the flour only used 3 tbls. I aslo added worcestershire to the gravy about 1 tsp and that seemed to give it a nice flavor. I will make these again they are very good I bet they are great with the ground beef as wll.

I was skeptical that this would turn out. I come from the school of use the packet seasoning mixes and cream of mushroom soup for the gravy, as my mom made it that way. Not so. This was close to how mom made it, but WAY BETTER. I increased the recipe to use two pounds of meat (10 servings). In the meatball mixture, I added 1 tsp. each of onion powder, garlic powder, dried oregano and dried basil with the rest of the dried ingredients. I formed them into balls and baked them in a 9x13 baking dish at 350* for a half hour, then drained all the fat off and gently stirred it into the sauce. For the sauce, I sauteed a diced onion, 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms and garlic in a mixture of butter and EVOO, then added the remaining sauce ingredients. Served over Rich Mashed Potatoes, this was pure comfort food. The addition of the mushrooms, garlic and onion with the evaporated milk and beef broth made a mushroom-soup base without all the chemicals. And the dill, lemme tell you....I wasn't sure it would work but it really did. Freaking noms. I'm stoked there's just enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. NOTE: The addition of the dried milk to the meatballs? Money idea. I wish I'd thought of it. Try it with the little additions I made. You'll be glad you did.

This has quickly became one of my favorites to make. It is very easy and delicious. My husband loves it, and I can actually get my picky eater kids to eat it as well. I use the no yolk egg noodles with a little oil in the water to prevent sticking and it turns out great every time.

I was only able to make the meatballs because I did not have the ingrediants for the sauce.  The meatballs are great tasting.  I used garlic powder and then the same amount of salt, also added about 1/8 t. of pepper.  For the sauce I used mushroom soup and added some sharp cheese to it.

This rating is based on the sauce mostly. The meatballs were fine but we didn't care for the sauce. Mine turned out like flavorless paste. If anyone wants to make swedish meatballs I would try a different recipe. I wouldn't make this again. I added worcestershire and some garlic as per another user's suggestion and it was still flavorless. Perhaps using au jus instead of broth would produce slightly better results?

I really enjoyed these!  My husband actually made them, omitting the onion, and they were excellent.  They reminded me of the Swedish Meatballs my mother used to make when I was a child.  Will definitely make again (but I think I would add a wee bit more nutmeg & dillweed, just because I love them...).

Loved It!.  I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg instead of dill added about 1 tbsp of vermouth (better than wine) and 1 tsp of worchestershire.  I also used premade italian meatballs from Schwans and made the sauce in a pan.  Then put the meatballs down in the crockpot and added the sauce and let it cook on low for about 2 hours.  It was ready for us to eat when we were ready.  Husband loved it.  Served it with egg noodles the first night and the wonderful leftovers with angel hair.  Yum Yum!!!!!

I agree with the other reviewers who say that the sauce in this recipe is very bland.  Required a lot of salt to make it tasty enough, but still wasn't what I was looking for.  However, the meatballs were excellent--perfect flavor & texture, and I plan to use the meatballs from this recipe and combine them with the sauce from Jessica's recipe (Swedish Meatballs I).

I only used the sauce recipe from this recipe. It made a very bland sauce which tasted of... uh. Nothing. Even after adding salt (which was not required in the recipe) the sauce was still bland. I even added condensed cream of mushroom and it was still bland. The end resulted in a bad meal. I dont know about the meatballs. They may be good (I sure wish I used this meatball recipe).

I liked this recipe a lot. This is the second time I have made it. The first time I made it I used a 7% fat hamburger and that was a mistake I think. There weren't any juices so my gravy was made strictly out of the added oil! (2nd time I added butter to make up the diff) Anyway, The 15% fat hamburger seemed pretty good... although I would be tempted to try higher. I also saute'ed some mushrooms that I topped the noodles with before dumping the meatballs and gravy on top.

Very delicious!  Try using reconstituted dry onions instead of fresh onions in the meatballs. I've used this meatball recipe (minus the gravy) for spaghetti and meatballs and for stuffed peppers.  Turns out great!
Gravy good, but needed a lot of salt.  Use whole milk instead of evaporated milk, no noticable difference in taste in my opinion.

I found the dish to be somewhat bland. Although it was good, I will keep looking for a swedish meatball recipe that I like more. There was way too much sauce in my opinion, 1/2 the sauce would have been much better.

Family and friends were driven mad by the wonderful aroma through the house.  I used butter instead of oil too, added mushrooms to the sauce and served with sliced steamed carrots.  Got rave reviews.  The combination of nutmeg, garlic and papper is delicate, yet intrigueing.  Simply pleasing.  This is a permanent meatball recipe now.  Thank you very much!

It was a really great recipe. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. It turned out wonderfully, however there were no drippings leftover for the gravy. Just an FYI, this  recipe in my opinion needs a tad more salt. Still its one of my favorite recipes.

Very Yummy. I would give the meatball's a 5 star and the gravy a 3.5, so let's call it 4. I subbed ground turkey for the beef and it worked out great, also I omitted the powdered milk b/c I didn't have any and didn't want to purchase any just for this recipe. The gravy was pretty good, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, I wanted something a bit creamier. I'll keep looking for a recipe for the gravy but am sure I'll make these meatballs again! Thanks for the recipe:)

My rating is for the gravy. I used my own meatballs. 
This is a good basic recipe, but I did change a few things. I used salted butter instead of oil. I added garlic and onion powder, and a little worcestershire. I didn't have to add salt with those ingredients.

Good basic recipe.  You don't need the instant dry milk (if you don't usually use it).  I did NOT use oil in my sauce, I used an equal amount of butter-richer taste I thought.  It's a nice sauce, but I kicked it up a bit with (believe this) a teaspoon of cider vinegar!  If you could use fresh dill all the better!  Didn't make the meatballs as big as they suggested - thought the meatballs were suppose to be smaller (??) but then I used them as an appetizer instead of a dinner.

About as close to IKEA swedish meatballs as you can get! Loved it and so did the family!
