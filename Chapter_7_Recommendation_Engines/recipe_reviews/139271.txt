I had high hopes for this recipe because I love pineapple and ham together but these were really greasy and got soggy very quick. I dont know if I did something wrong but they were runny and just not what I was expecting. Im giving it three stars because I think that it is possible for the sandwich to be good if a slice of pinnapple was used to replace the crushed pinnapple and if very little oil is used.

This was rather disgusting, and not kid friendly as my results turned out to be. Made a plate of these for my boyfriend's 10 yr. old sister's birthday party. A few bites were missing from a couple, but most were left untouched. Tried one myself and I can see why. Ham and pineapple are better suited for pizza, not french toast.

These were fine.  I am not sure if it was worth the calories but I am glad I tried them.   Thanks!
