This sounded like just what I was looking for, and with just a few minor changes (strictly to suit ourselves) it was big hit. I made up the dressing first (from the apple juice on)and dressed the wheatberries while they were still hot as I believe that they will absorb the flavors better that way. I wanted something a little less sweet, a bit more "main dish", so I added 3 stalks of diced celery, 1/2 of a large red onion, diced, and 1 large carrot, grated. Also swapped dried cranberries for raisins, pecans for walnuts, and used a huge Mutsu apple (extra crisp, not too sweet). Definitely a keeper!

I was ready to toss this receipe as a "salad" but instead used it as a breakfast meal andit was fantastic.  I made it the night before, spooned out what I wanted for breakfast in a bowl, topped it with 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of butter, heated it until warm and it was great.  It makes a TON so I would suggest halving the recipe. Update as of 5/22/17, I made this again as a salad following the recipe exactly and really enjoyed it AS A SALAD.  Great flavors.  I cooked the wheatberries for the 80 minutes and they were perfect.

Fantastic:  beautiful, tasty, and nutritious.    I was really satisfied with a wheat berry salad recipe by chef Ellie Krieger, but this recipe is superior due to the dressing.    However, I do include a couple of elements from chef Krieger's recipe.   I add 2 stalks of celery and 1 scallion, both finely chopped.     
 Also, if you can't find pomegranate seeds, consider substituting dried *tart* cherries, such as Montmorency cherries.   They're not the same, but the salad really benefits from tartness, so try to keep that element as part of the dish, one way or another.

Made it for a dinner party with fresh trout.  Used craisins and yellow raisins.  Was a very colorful and appetizing presentation.  It wasn't what I expected, yet very good.  A nice combination of flavors.  Make it far enough in advance so the flavors have sufficient time to meld.

The only change that I made to this recipe was the way that I cooked the wheat berries. The only wheat berries that I could find were already parboiled so they only took 15 min to cook with no soaking. Make sure that you check the package for that. I am glad that I did or I would have had mush! I found that I only needed half of the wheat berries after I cooked them. The salad is great! The only thing that I would do next time is cut down a little on the nutmeg (only for personal tastes). The pomegranates really make the salad :) This recipe is great for quick, healthy breakfasts and snacks. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This is so yummy and healthy!  It reminds me of Charoses, which I haven't had since I was a kid!  I didn't have pomegranate seeds or apple juice so I substituted with pomegranate juice. It happens to be very tart so I added a bit of honey too. Also, I only had one cup of wheat berries so I substituted with some quinoa. It was very hearty and delicious!  Thank you for reminding me how much I love wheat berries!

I liked quite a few things about this salad.  It was my first experience with wheatberries and I really like them.  I like the apple and raisin and nuts.  I am not crazy about the nutmeg and cinnamon.  Those flavors overpowered  the other flavors and ended up leaving an aftertaste that wasn't pleasant.  I'm not sure what I would do to substitute for those.  So, I think I'll look for other recipes to utilize the wheatberry instead.

This was so delicious.  It was also very pretty at my Christmas dinner table.  I couldn't find wheat berries, so I used quinoa instead.

Did I sin by letting this sit one day to absorb the spicing, then draining the vinegar and adding mayonnaise? A Waldorf just isn't a Waldorf without mayo.  Also, this level of spicing moved this out of salad territory.   It was more like mincemeat.  This might be interesting in another use, but was overwhelming for a salad.

I am unable to edit the actual recipe. I wanted to provide instant pot/faster cooking time:  2 cups of wheat berries, 6 cups of water in instant pot. Stir and seal. Manual, high-pressure for 27 minutes. Natural release for 10.

I used only 1 apple, added some red onion and substituted dried cranberries for the pomegranate seeds. Based on the other reviews I cut the pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon in half. This salad was a big hit at my dinner party and the leftovers made for awesome lunches the next day. 2 days later and it still tastes great so go ahead and make the whole batch if you like leftovers!

Recipe was great! Only things I changed were to use half as many wheatberries and apple cider instead of apple juice. The wheatberry cook time was also significantly less than listed. I probably needed about half an hour.

Love this recipe!  It's a nice change from my usual version of Waldorf salad which uses yogurt as the base, and this is much more filling.  My wheat berries were stubborn and I did end up cooking for the full 80 minutes.  I do agree with those who have said the wheat berry to apple ratio seems pretty high-- next time I would halve the wheat berry amount (or probably just double everything else, because I love this dish and like to make large quantities).

I made this exactly as the recipe said except I left out the pomegranate and subbed pecans for the walnuts.  It was wonderful.  I made it again for breakfast and left out the parsley.  I made it a second time for breakfast and added sweet potato that I cut in 3/4" chunks, coated lightly with olive oil and heavily with ground cinnamon then roasted.  I topped it with vanilla yogurt.

I thought this was really good. The only thing I changed was adding a little honey, as someone suggested, and increasing the amount of apple cider vinegar. Delicious!

Sooooo good.  I didn't change a thing.  Much better the next day.  My 4-year-old called this "dessert" and I agree.  It hits the spot for a satisfying, nutty, tangy, not-too-sweet bowl of goodness.  Great after I work out, too.  I'm really glad it made so much.  I have more wheat berries and will probably make this again soon!

I really wanted to like this salad. I eat pretty healthily, I don't eat processed sugar & was hoping this salad would be a new guiltless dish for me but it wasn't.  The amount of wheat berries compared with other ingredients is overwhelming. If I were to do it again, I'd use only a quarter of what the recipe calls for.
