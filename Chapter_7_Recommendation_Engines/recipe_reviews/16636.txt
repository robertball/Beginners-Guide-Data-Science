This sauce was very tasty.  Made a few changes...added some lemon and lime juices and a little red pepper.  Was pretty easy to make, but had a hard time finding the Thai sauce to put in it.  Had to go to bunch of different stores before I found it.

This tastes EXACTLY like the mango sauce served at my favorite Thai restaurant. I have been making this mango sauce for years and always come back to this exact recipe. I have used it in the past on chicken when I ate meat and now I use it on tofu and faux chicken and it is still just as amazing.   Use whatever meat or faux-meat you want, stir fry with red and yellow peppers, onions and add sauce, cook a little longer, serve over rice. For extra heat sometimes I will add more garlic pepper sauce or just add some dried thai chiles.

Easy, fab and perfect!   Lime juice cut the sweetness and I put it on grilled halibut.  WOW.   Will use this as a dipping sauce for grilled shrimp at my Fourth of July party.  Sure to be a hit.

This was a little bland and definitely needs some acid, a pretty good squeeze of lime juice.   I was expecting something with little more kick, so I also added red pepper flakes as well.  Not the best mango sauce that I've made, but it was OK.

Super easy to make and gives a really tropical twist to Pork Loin and grilled fish.  Followed another reviewer with the lime (add a little at a time to knock down the sweetness to your desire) and red pepper.  I also shaved several pieces of mango to garnish.  On a lark I put some on open faced biscuits for the grandkids and they 'wolfed' it down in a heartbeat! I see lots of applications for this sauce/glaze.
