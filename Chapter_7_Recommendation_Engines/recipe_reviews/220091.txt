OH MAN! This is a great soup. Made a little healthier version  - used veggie broth, omitted the bacon, and used skim milk. I over-salted the soup and remembered a trick my grandma told me once. Peel and cut in half a potato, add to the soup, cook until the potato is soft, remove potato. It pulled just the perfect amount of salt out of the soup. PERFECT! Thanks for the great recipe.

This soup is amazing! The only change I made was to add the mushrooms with the asparagus stalks so that I could puree the mushrooms and hide them from my son. He hates mushrooms.

This is a great soup. I fought the inclination to put some garlic in with the cooking onions and the celery, but it didn't need it. The bacon bits I used were from one of those "real bacon bits" bags so I could use the actual bacon I cooked in my microwave for BLT sandwiches. This soup is to die for and I cooked it exactly as described by this excellent chef/mother. Thanks for the new soup recipe and I am sure the other readers will be checking this recipe out soon.

This soup is absolutely fabulous. I made it exactly according to the recipe... no need for any changes! You could leave out the half and half and it still is lovely. I ended up adding it in because I hate it when people make a bunch of changes and then criticize the original recipe. It also reheats well the next day.

I gave 4 stars as I had to add some flavor - a little extra sea salt, fresh ground pepper and a couple dashes of cayenne really brought out the flavors. I used leftover steamed asparagus (added later in the process) and kept aside the tips (also added later to the mushrooms). I sliced the mushrooms super thin on a mandoline, used fat free 1/2 &1/2, and bumped up the flavor of the chicken broth with a little chicken broth paste (awesome stuff).  yummy recipe!!

This was a fantastic soup. Absolutely gorgeous. I've made this two or three times now. I added a little extra bacon & bacon drippings, and used cream instead of half and half to thicken a little more the second time. I don't think you need to do either of those things to still have an absolutely amazing soup, though! Fantastic!

This is  awesome!  I used portabello mushrooms and added more than it called for as well as more asparagus.  I did not have half and half and used skim milk, it tasted great!  The bacon gives it that savory, delicious taste it needs.  Thank you for such a yummy soup for a cold day!

Awesome soop. Took me a bit longer as I made my own chicken broth, but the final result was plain wonderful. Next time I'd add a bit more potatoes though to make a bit more creamy.

I followed the recipe exactly and this soup knocks it out of the park with great flavor and elegance. The only change I would make is to add more asparagus and maybe potatoes at the end to give it more texture.  (Just a personal preference.)

Was skeptical about the lack of added seasoning in this recipe but it was fantastic.
Made a few changes - left out potato cause I didn't have one on hand and used coconut milk instead of the cream (again cause I didn't have half and half or regular cream).
I added tips to boiling broth at same time as asparagus stalks.
I also sauteed the mushrooms in a little bit of bacon fat and added to the rest of the soup when I was simmering for the 20 minutes and then pureed the whole thing due to having kids who will pick out and waste the mushrooms.
I added 1/2 tsp salt and a small amount of fresh ground pepper and the result was awesome!
Will definitely add this to my cooking favorites binder!

my new fave - was in a hurry so used what was in the pantry - vegetta & hot water instead of chicken stock and chopped rehydrated crimini mushrooms and real bacon bits from a bag - I know it will be even better when made as the recipe states to - can't wait!

This is really good. I will use two bunches of asparagus next time. I used one this time. I cooked up a half of a package of sliced bacon so that everyone had plenty to top their soups with. I didn't purée the whole soup. I wanted to be able to chew on some celery and onion. And I have been taught to always cook the flour for a good three minutes so that there isn't any flour taste. The suggested one minute may not be long enough. This is a healthy cream soup with only 3/4 cup of half & half. The puréed potatoes really thickened it up nicely.

I used 2 potatoes since I only had 2 left in the fridge
though that won't change the flavor much. I did find it a tad bland for me and ended up adding 2 cloves of crushed garlic and an extra 1/4 tsp of black pepper. I started out with 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper (didn't need more salt between the chicken broth and bacon already having plenty).

Wow.  This was delicious way beyond my expectations.  I was just trying to use up some mushrooms and asparagus I had.  Didnt expect it to taste so good.  Of course, I completely altered the amounts of things according to what I had on hand (no bacon even!).  More butter and more cream than was called for must have made up for that.  Will make this again!

This is very good.  The only thing i didn't do was puree it.  I took a hand mixer and mixed it for about 5 min.  This got rid of the potato chunks, but left the asparagus intact.  This gave the soup a little more texture.  DELICIOUS!

Thanks for this recipe! I haven't tried it yet, however, I know I'll like it. I'm a big fan of Shakey's creamy mushroom soup, and I want to know how to make it. Though this is not Shakey's thick mushroom soup, I will like this, maybe love it, even.

What a great soup and I love the fact that in the end you still have bits of Asparagus not pureed. It was also a nice touch having the bacon pieces on top.  I did have to make one small sub but I don't think it changed it much.  I only had 5 cups of chicken broth so I did use 1 cup of vegetable broth. The only reason I gave it a 4 was that I have had another Asparagus soup from this site that was better, but please try this one.

This was amazing, by far the best soup I have ever made and I am a big soup maker! My husband even loved it and claims he doesn't like soup! Only thing was I added more mushrooms because I love them and added a little garlic salt. Yummy!

I bought a case of asparagus at a great price, so I needed some recipes to help use it up.  Just made this soup tonight.  It was fabulous.  I used 2 potatoes since they were on the smaller side and for added creaminess.  I pureed everything with an immersion blender so I cooked the mushrooms and asparagus tips in another pot with a bit of mushroom and rosemary flavored olive oil from the EVOO store.  Loved the mushrooms in it, and the bacon.  Will need to cook more bacon for the leftovers.  Will definately make this again.

Excellent, satisfying soup! I had a couple of portabella caps on hand so I used those instead of the white mushrooms. And I got to use my stick blender!  So much easier and safer than a blender!  One little time saver I employed was to use Hormel Crumbled bacon and bacon drippings reserved from another bacon frying session to saute the veggies.

This soup is great! I have made it twice. Left out the bacon the second time, but still used bacon grease. It was still great even without the bacon. I cooked the onions and mushrooms much longer than suggested and seasoned to taste.

As a vegetarian, I made some tweaks to this soup and it was still super delicious. Both my hubby and our seven year old daughter came back for seconds. I clearly omitted the bacon and bacon drippings, and instead used an extra tablespoon of butter. I also replaced the chicken stock with veggie broth. This is a great, flavorful and hearty soup that was so satisfying on a winter night! Made grilled cheese to go along with it and it was the perfect meal.

Fabulous soup! My husband and I loved it so I will make it again.  A satisfying dinner with a French Banquet and good Irish butter. I added a quarter of Cream cheese to the pot and my husband added a splash of Truffle oil to his bowl.

This soup is wonderfully tasty and hearty. I used vegetable broth and lactose-free milk and it was still thick and creamy. This is definitely a keeper for our menus.

I love the soup!  I’ll be making it again today because I have all the ingredients, the time, and two roommates who love it as much as I do! I discovered this soup several years ago, and this recipe has taught me the concept of quality soup making. Thank you for the recipe and, especially, thank you for the technique that can be applied to so many soups. I often substitute spinach for the asparagus, or I will add both, or a variety of vegetables. This soup is packed with goodness!

Great, super tasty. The adjustments I'd make a second time, not cook bacon for 10 minutes - I burnt it. I'll dice the heads of the asparagus and possibly small bites for the mushrooms too. I'll also serve with soft bread for dipping.

Turned out really tasty and wasn't to much work either. Had everything at home for enjoyable dinner. Couple of changes are added carrots to the celery and onion and using cream cheese instead of the sour cream. Topped it off with some home-made croutons.

Best soup recipe out there! The only thing I change (since the hubby doesn’t like the mushroom texture), I blend the mushrooms with the rest of the soup. Sooooo good!

this was so good but I'm still trying to find the flavor of one I had in the restaurant in Cedar Rapids Iowa. I think I'll saute a few more mushrooms and blend them with the. Soup. I like more stuff in my soup so I will probably add half again as much of the mushrooms and asparagus tips has called for at the end of the recipe. Flavor was terrific and I certainly will make it again.

I feel guilty about not raving on this site about this recipe before...  God knows I've sent it to enough  friends.  I did use crimini mushrooms (about 12 oz) and cut the slices into a rough chop after sweating.  Also added a pinch or two of cayenne.
A wonderful recipe!

Highly recommend this one. I'm a soup snob. This was excellent! I always tweak my recipes, can't seem to stick to exactly what the recipe says. That's the art of cooking in my opinion, to make it my own. But really, this was pretty much spot on. Toward the end, I had fun sampling tastes in little dishes. One with a bit of Worcestershire sauce. Wow! Then another small sample of soup with a few drops of Braggs amino acids. Wowzers! Deelish! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I will forward this to them with my adjustments. (Note: Boil the chopped potatoes & asparagus in 3 cups of water until soft. Use a potato masher instead of blender. E.A.S.Y! Then simply add all of it to the pot of soup.) Voilá (Also, this is my very 1st recipe review online ever!)

I made it, didn't change a thing and for Christmas will be making it again. Love soups, but this is a step above. Can't wait to serve it to my friends. It's easy to convert to gluten free for all my guests to enjoy.

I made this to use up some asparagus and mushrooms that had been sitting in the fridge for longer than they should.   The soup still tasted great.  I followed the steps pretty much as given but played fast and loose with amounts on most of the ingredients.

This is pure ambrosia! I made one change, and only because we made a mistake in shopping...I only had four cups of chicken stock, and the second box was beef stock, so I used 2 cups of the beef.  This is the best soup ever. Years ago, in a snooty French restaurant, my husband had cream of asparagus soup, and he bragged about it all the time. I used this recipe to quell his need for it...and he swore it's better than what he got in the restaurant. I also upped the half-and-half by a quarter cup, using 1 full cup.  Next time, I'm going to blend the bacon into the soup as well as having some for garnishing. The flavors were spectacular, and I'm already planning a huge batch so I'll be able to can some for this winter while asparagus is still easily available.  My most sincere compliments to the home chef who created this recipe!

Subsequent batch: I boo-booed. I got distracted and put in *way* too much chicken broth. 2 full quarts instead of 6 cups. I know I'm not going to be the only one to do this.   I fixed it by adding a second medium potato, and using cream instead of half and half. The resulting soup was still heavenly, subtle and delicious. The thickness of the cream made up for the extra broth, as did the extra potato, all without noticeably compromising the taste or texture. This stuff's just perfect.

I had made pickled asparagus and had loads of spears left.  Looking for a way to use them up.I did not have celery, cost very high right now.  I added about 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  I used low sodium stock so it really did not increase the saltyness.  I also left out the flour.  This makes a large pot so the neighbours are also enjoying this.  Will make again.

I added 1 bay leaf while simmering, being sure to remove it before blending. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Soup was DELICIOUS!!!  Definitely will make again.

This is is AMAZING! My husband said, "it's the best soup I've ever had!" I almost doubled the recipe but decided against it since I had never had asparagus soup before. My son loved it and he hates asparagus lol! I followed recipe to a T, it was delicious. My husband bought an extra bunch of asparagus so I will be making this again in a couple days. Like I said folks this is delicious and even for those of you out there that don't like asparagus just try it I'm telling you you will absolutely love it!!

This was the perfect mix of ingredients.  I didn't puree the soup when making it the first time, however every other instruction was followed.   I tend to have a strong preference for chunkier soups.   I wouldn't mind trying to puree more of the soup next time.  Regardless, the flavor, though, was absolutely wonderful.  There isn't a single thing that I would change.  I suspect that you could remove the bacon and bacon drippings if you so desired.

I made this exactly as directed. It was easy and we enjoyed it. I am giving only four stars just because I think it could have done with just a little herbal seasoning to liven it up a bit. Next time I will make a small bundle of herbs (like rosemary and a bay leaf) and remove them before pureeing the soup. I will also double the mushrooms next time because we love mushrooms. A splash of sherry might have also been nice.

I added some garlic when cooking the celery and onions and then a bit of curry powder. I didn't think it had enough mushrooms so added more of those. Delicious. I was using up asparagus I had on hand and was doubtful that my husband would like it. He loved it and told me I really should open up my own soup shop as he always likes my soups.

This was a delightful soup. The ingredients seemed to go together in a new way for me, and I was concerned, but it turned out beautifully and in retrospect was not difficult to make at all.

OMG! So good! I made it exactly as written except I used more bacon (of course!)  I also added spices during the simmering time (whatever suits your taste) and some minced garlic to the mushroom mixture.  EVERYONE had seconds and my 11 year old daughter had 3 bowls! You must try this one.

Lovely soup. Made as written except I'm vegetarian so added a dash of smoked paprika on serving , instead of the bacon. I would never have thought of adding mushrooms to asparagus soup, but thank you, Kristy!

I've made this soup several times.  You can leave out the mushrooms and it's still good, but it's better with the mushrooms.  They need to be fresh as well.  This is a crowd pleaser and I make it with asparagus that is a bit old so it saves money! I also like to serve it with sourdough rolls and salad.

Really didn't like the flavor. Followed the directions exactly and very planty nasty aftertaste and smell. I could not taste the onion or anything except asparagus. I put almost a whole block of medium cheddar cheese into the soup to make it edible. The Cheese flavor covered the nasty aftertaste.

Great flavor and very simple.  I might add a bit more potato next time for a little thicker texture.  Just personal preference, thought.

I'm a vegetarian so I made a few changes. Used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and sautéed the onion and celery in olive oil.  I prefer more of a chowder so I used a stick blender  and blended a few times leaving the soup a little chunky.  I added sliced carrots, extra mushrooms and 1/2C frozen corn.   Served with a warm spinach salad.  Cooked bacon crumbles on the side for the meat eater in the family.  Healthy, hearty and delicious!

I changed the chicken broth and mushroom parts up a bit. I used 3 x 14.5 ounces instead of a full 6 cups of broth. And when I added potato and asparagus bits to simmer I added dried king boletes and shaggy Maine mushrooms. I cut the last bit of raw store bought mushroom into small slices and used only a quarter of what this recipe called for. (The dried mushrooms made up for it) this recipe is freaking awesome.  Thanks.

Delicious! I used baby bella mushrooms for additional flavor. Used olive oil instead of bacon drippings to saute vegetables, plain soy milk instead of half and half.

This is a delicious soup, one of my favourites.  I substituted sweet potato for the potato, and this added sweetness.  I also used more asparagus than the suggested amount, which thickened it a bit more.   Other than that, I followed the recipe.

Just made this Christmas Eve for Christmas lunch tomorrow and had to have a cup to taste test before serving my guests.  Very good soup overall, and adding the bacon drippings adds a smoky flavor to the bottom of the flavor profile, and the contrasting texture of the asparagus tips, which I blanched in salted water, along with the sauteed mushrooms, which I drained, made the soup almost a one cup meal given the protein value of the mushrooms.  The crumbled bacon on top made this extra decadent, and tomorrow I plan on making some homemade croutons from a stale baguette, which will give it even more crunch.  The only thing I added was some fresh squeezed lemon juice, and some worcestershire sauce to give the soup and overall more complex flavor.  The asparagus was a much more subtle taste, than a traditional asparagus soup, where you primarily taste just asparagus and onion or asparagus and leek.  This soup has it all.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Like most of us non-purists...I like to modify recipes to reflect personal preferences and on hand stuff. I'm also not cutting the stars down because I did. So, personally, I started by skipping the bacon...didn't want that texture in a creamy soup. Instead, I used previously reserved refrigerated bacon fat. Another recipe suggested a diced Jalapeno, which I added to the mushrooms, celery and onions plus a few cloves of Garlic and my homemade Seasoning Salt. I used the fresh Turkey Stock made from Thanksgiving detritus...though chicken would be better probably, Plus I don't peel the spuds. I used unsalted butter because like the Stock...it's what I had. The blending was a lot easier w/ a stick blender. Also less salty considering it's MY stock recipe, unsalted butter and my own Seasoning Salt. BTW...The soup is great w/ tremendous flavor. My guest loved it and I'm counting on it freezing well.

Thanks for the awesome recipe - This one's going in my recipe box for sure! Made soup to use up abundant asparagus from garden. Going to freeze it for a cold winter day. Tasted so yummy, would like to say I can't wait for winter to eat it but, can't bring myself to say such silliness.

Very good,I used precooked bacon so I didn't have any bacon drippings for the extra flavor . Next time I will use the drippings. But it was very good.i it gave me a good excuse to purchase a hand blender ,which worked beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe.
