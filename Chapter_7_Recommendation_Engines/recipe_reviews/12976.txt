We have updated the nutrition to this recipe to assign the proper cooked nutritional analysis for the beef. It was causing the grams of fat to show much higher than they actually are.

All I can say is -- FIFTY FOUR GRAMS OF FAT???  
Made this (and ate this) before looking at the nutritional information.  It was very tasty, however, if I'm going to eat 900 calories and 54 grams of fat in one sitting again, it sure as heck won't be from stew! Yikes!

Very easy but tasty!  Watch the simmer as the creamed corn burns easily.  I serve over rice and skip the sour cream.  ETA ~ The last time I made this, I got smart and used my slow cooker.  It worked great, no burnt corn!  I just browned the meat and then threw everything together in the cooker and set it on high.  I think I let it cook for about an hour.

This looked like slop in a pot BUT it was VERY GOOD! Typically, I like spicier chili's while my boyfriend prefers mild. Even though this is a very mild chili, it was really good and my boyfriend ate a couple bowls himself! It is very thick - but then again, it is a STEW. Still, with a little shredded cheese over the top, this was great! Thanks again LaDonna for another great recipe!

This is a good recipe for cold days, and very good with cornbread or corn muffins.  Makes a complete meal and makes you warm inside.

I made this soup when I first moved out on my own, only I used regular canned corn and I added a packet of taco seasoning. It was great because I could buy all the ingredients for less than five dollars and eat well for a week, or longer if I made cornbread to go with. I wasn't much of a cook back then so I dumped everything in the crockpot (after I browned the meat) and left it to simmer all day. I did beef it up just a bit with a couple cans of diced tomatoes. This mixed with cream cheese makes a GREAT "taco" crockpot dip for large gatherings. You can also sub ground turkey or chicken for the beef. When I make this now, I use my own taco seasoning only because the flavor is better.

I've made this several times and each time it was quick, easy and enjoyed by all. It's especially good for cold evenings and sports-themed parties (i.e. Super Bowl parties!).

Thanks!

Just ok, and wouldn't make again. Doesn't get much easier though. After tasting it I added some hot sauce, and some garlic powder, and even some hot dog.  It'd probably be good as is with corn bread.

This was edible, and easy to make, but that's about it. It lacked pretty heavily in the flavor department. I don't think I will make this again.

This really did look like slop in the pot. But it tasted really good. My husband and I were both surprised! I didn't have a can of chili so I threw in some kidney beans and some chili powder. Also added ground pork with the ground beef. Turned out really tasty. Thanks!

Indeed, Slop in a Pot, but oh so tasty!!  I do felt that it needed a little something, so next time I may add a little jalapenos or something, I'm not sure yet.  Hubby and our 2 yr old absolutely Loved it!  Going into the monthly rotation :)

This was just ok for me but my husband liked it. I kept wanting to keep adding stuff to it to get some kind of flavor. Maybe I went overboard. But, I added a can of tomato soup and some macaroni and extra corn. My hubby made his skillet cornbread with it.

Everyone in my family liked this and went back for thirds!  It was a great recipe for using up some things in my pantry before they get too old.  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used tomato soup.  Also used vegetarian beans instead of pork & beans.  Thanks for the recipe.

I changed a few things around in this recipe so that I could use what I  had on hand.  I doubled this recipe and substituted 1 can or Rotel for the second can of tomato sauce and the diced green chilis.  I also added canned chili without beans because this is what I had.  I also added 1 small can of tomato paste and 2 T sugar.  This turned out great with ingredients that I had on hand.

Very good alternative to normal chili.  Used ground venison and worked well.  Mine turned out slightly sweet which I think was from the type of baked beans I used.  Family approved.

Very good.  I "doctored" this the way that I would baked beans - added some mustard powder (1 tsp, maybe), a shake or two of Paprika and a shake or two of chili powder, and maybe 1/4 c brown sugar. The sweet and hot of it was WONDERFUL.

My boyfriend had to add Tabasco sauce in it, as it wasn't spicy enough. Other than that, he said it was the best chili thus far.

I made this and was a little skeptical at the appearance of the final result, but my husband LOVED it and asked me to please make it again. I did make one change to the original recipe that helped make it so successful: I didn't have a can of diced green chiles, so I substituted a few tablespoons of green tomatillo salsa. It gave the stew a smoky character that helped counteract the sweetness of the corn and tomato sauce. One other change: We don't eat pork, so I used a can of vegetarian baked beans. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was *sorta* like chili, but not quite.  With the corn, baked beans and tomato sauce, it's closer to having chili with some side dishes already thrown in.  So it's not spicy like chili, no, and I wouldn't expect it.  Fairly good.  It's what I call a "mac & cheese" meal, meaning just something simple for a Sunday supper.  (And certainly something I could expect for cowboys :), or a campout.)  I didn't think it was great or anything, but super easy, pull out the canned stuff while the meat is cooking, thrown the rest in, you're done.

We all loved this, quick and easy. Will make this again. My kids loved this without the cheese and my huband and I liked with the cheese and some chopped red onion and cilantro on top

Great recipe.  I added a 22 oz of Icehouse for extra flavor.  Extra tip, to make extra spicy just in case everyone can not eat spicy foods, I added pepper jack cheese with jalapeno peppers. Mmmmm!

This tasted alot like chili!  I also made the mistake of using can jalapenos instead of chili's...but was a GREAT mistake!  When I realized what I did right after I dumped them in I scooped some of them back out.  So I think I used about half the can.  Next time, yes, next time I make this I will add a few less than a half can of jalapenos.  It added a little kick.  I also used tomato soup as I didn't have any tomato sauce.  It was a little sweet but had a nice kick.  I paired it with Beer Bread I from this site which was perfect together!  Thank You!

Excellent.  Very good and easy to make, everyone loved it.  I didnt know what was meant by "baked beans with pork" in the ingredient list so I used Pork+Beans.  Its very mild, hardly any chili heat.  I made some corn bread in an iron skillet and it made a great winter-day meal.  Recommended.

This was a nice change from reqular chili or taco flavored meals. Both my kids loved it with sour cream and cheese. I accidently forgot the chili's, which I think would have added a lot more flavor, so will be definitely making again--very easy and quick. I served with cornbread.

This is one of the first recipes I made after discovering this site, and I still find it delicious and easy to make.  Great simple hearty chili that can be assembled in a hurry from mostly canned ingredients.  Easy crowd pleaser served with cheese on top and cornbread.

I only used a pound of beef because that's what I had.  I also added a can of diced potatoes, a teaspoon each of cumin and oregano, and a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  It turned out to be a very mild chili, but this recipe makes A LOT -- certainly more than 4 servings.  I like this one because (a) it is so easy, and (b) each person can spice it up (or not) to their own taste with one or two or six dashes of Tabasco.  A nice meal on a cold, wet November day!

I had no idea how this would turn out -- was skeptical to say the least but had leftover baked beans and figured what the heck. It's perfect!  I did make a few changes.  Added taco seasoning like one reviewer suggested.  Chili powder too as another suggested.  And of course, my favorite paprika.  Also Jalepeno peppers and served over rice with garlic bread.  Sehr gut!

I tried this out of curiosity . It looked easy and it is. But it is also surprisingly good as is. Sour cream & cheese ate good on it but it is fine without. I will definitely make it again.

This is the best stew out of all the recipes I have tried.  I did make a few simple substitutions.  I used ground turkey.  I used vegetarian chili from Trader Joes, and vegetarian baked beans. The flavor was delicious. This is definitely a stew that I will make frequently.  Thanks.

Cowboy Stew was awesome! I left out the onion because of one person's allergies and it was still great! Served it to 3 of the pickiest eaters I know and waited for "Too spicy" etc, and they all loved it and went back for seconds! So, so easy!! I browned the ground beef and then just chucked everything into the slow cooker for 4 hours. Can't say enough nice things about the results!

I used less chilli powder than was called for. My daughter’s family really enjoyed the dish. It was super easy to prepare. The family gave it a thumbs up and asked for the recipe. I thought it tasted ok but I was not too impressed by what it looked like. To me, it’s something you make when you need something in a hurry, but again the family liked it more than I did.

It is a little bland. We added some cayenne pepper and it helped. A little sure does go a long way though! With only 2 of us we could have eaten it for a week!

A bit on the sweet side, probably due to the Bush's baked beans and creamed corn I used.  I added a few pepper flakes for a tad of heat, and eventually added some shelled peanuts (unsalted).  Served over rice or mashed potatoes, this made a filling and delicious lunch or dinner.

This is sooo good and so easy to make! I was signed up to bring baked beans to our last fellowship meal at church but I saw this recipe and tried it. Everyone loved it! Leftovers the next day were even better so next time I will make it a day ahead and reheat it. Serve with cornbread and you’ll have a super easy meal for heart appetites.

Made it just as the recipe calls with the exception of 15 oz of sauce.  I left it out.  This was delish!  My only crab is that it is made with processed/canned chili and bake beans.  There is a lot of unwanted sodium there and in the cream corn too.  But I must admit is was tasty.  And my hubby liked it too!  Will most likely make it again in a pinch as it took no time to put it together.

This is a great recipe.  I use it as a main dish but it would be a great side dish when the occasion calls for baked beans.  You can also change the beef for ground turkey or chicken to reduce the fat content.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I wasn't "wowed" and my family would have been happier with regular chili.  However don't let that deter you from making it and making it your own by changing it up.  I will definitely make it again and add a few things of my own (i.e. green peppers or even add some smoked sausage)

We had just returned from a camping trip & I had some canned food on hand that I normally don’t have, like canned chili & canned pork and beans and was thinking “what am I going to do with this?“. My husband had also invited a few of the guys over to watch the basketball game. I knew I would have to throw something together for them to snack on. I found this recipe on Allrecipes  and I had most of what I needed  so decided to make it a Queso dip.
I browned 2 lbs. of ground beef/ turkey, onions  and some chopped garlic seasoned with a little salt and pepper,  dumped that in my slow cooker,  added the 2 cans of chili, 2 cans of pork and beans, two cans of diced tomatoes, a can of corn, drained, 2 cans chopped green chilies, some Cheddar, Jack and a small block of Velveeta cheese plus a couple splashes of 1/2 & 1/2,  since I didn’t have any creamed corn  and let that cook for a couple of hours until everything was melted together and heated through. I added a little more cheese on top with some sour cream and chopped green onions, put out a huge bowl of tortilla  chips and a bottle of  tabasco for the ones who wanted something spicier, and plopped that all down on the coffee table in front of them. They all loved it. There was not a drop left by the end of the game.  The next day I had two of the wives call me to ask for the recipe because their husbands came home raving about this fabulous queso dip I made.  I was almost embarrassed to tell them how easy it was.

Mediocre. I guess okay if you want something fast and easy for a weeknight. It was VERY easy.  A bit bland. I added lots of salt and pepper, cayenne, and red chili pepper flakes. Good source of protein for my kiddo.

Oh so good! I added celery with the onion and instead of tomato sauce had a can of Progressive Hearty Tomato soup that needed to be used. Outside of being a bit more soupy, it's wonderful as is. We put it over some cornbread and will have this again soon, probably with some more hot sauce additions because we like spicy.

No one loves to build a pot of chili for hours and hours, cooking beef and pork to shred and adding layers of flavor to the pot as the chili simmers, more than I do.  But sometimes I don't feel up to it, or need something quick and good, and all I have defrosted is ground beef.  This is it!  You can spice it up, if you need to, or add whatever kind of beans you have in the pantry, instead.  Once I had frozen corn, but no cream corn.  I did use some of the frozen corn for the corn flavor and texture, and used a can of refried beans as the thickening agent I lost, not having cream corn, Worked fine.  For a 30 minute recipe with very few ingredients, it's a winner.   I wouldn't serve this at a dinner party, but it's good for a quick, inexpensive meal.  Hubby likes it on hot dogs too, and that's easy enough.   Thank you.
